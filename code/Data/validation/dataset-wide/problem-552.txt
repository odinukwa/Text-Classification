I recently "upgraded" to a Romin Comp Gel saddle from a soft racing saddle because my old one, while extremely comfortable on long road rides, wasn't working for the TT position I'm now practicing for an upcoming Ironman. I've been professionally fit with the seat, so I think things are lined up well. I've ridden nearly 200 miles over the last week with it and the problem is: it still freaking hurts. It's not chafing; it's pressure right in that, uh, under-area that's supposed to sit in the gap of the saddle. Can I expect it to get awesome any time soon, or should I try another saddle at this point? Edit: Regarding seat position, I have my current seat all the way forward, which is where I've been steadily moving it over the last two weeks since my professional fitting. Moving it forward did help, but now I'm stuck again (and I have one of those bent seatposts that is pointing forward as well). 

To answer your question, in the UK, the terms or would describe the technique. If you google these terms you'll get a lot of hits. 

I call BS on this. 25km/h is not a high speed, nor is the extra weight significant compared to the weight of the rider. Compare this to touring bikes. A touring bike will generally be expected to ride at this speed (less than 16mph) and the luggage will exceed the weight of a motor and battery - but nobody makes touring bike tyres that are made due to the expected "high speed". 

If you are riding during the day time then black is fine. If you are riding during dawn/dusk a bright orange jacket makes you much more visible. If you are riding in the dark then you need lights and reflectives. Colour (black/white/orange) doesn't matter. In my opinion brightly coloured orange clothing does nothing to improve your visibility in daylight or in the dark, but is really, really good in low light. Since most winter commuting is at dusk/dawn then a bright orange jacket is very useful. I ride with an orange Altura Night Vision windproof and would recommend it. It also has a lot of reflective areas which are good for night riding. 

The set screw actually applies pressure to a rubber o-ring, which in turn presses against the threads on the axle to keep the end cap from turning. On my wheel, that o-ring had actually partially disintegrated where the set screw contacted it. So instead of pressing a healthy o-ring against the threads, it just sort of mashed some rubber particulate in there. The right solution to this problem is probably to get a new o-ring. The route I took, however, was to rotate the o-ring about 90° so the set screw was once again above a healthy bit of rubber. I then re-adjusted the end cap tension and re-applied the set screw. Hopefully that keeps me going for a while without tightening up again. Thanks for all the help, everyone! 

I apparently loosened the "end cap" from the threading on the axle. Here's another pic of the whole assembly: 

By higher gears I assume you mean smaller cogs on the back, which are higher ratio gears. Usually your derailleur won't go there it's because of cable friction, although you could have a bent derailleur or derailleur tab. If you remove the cable from the derailleur it should drop down into these gears. If not it's probably due to a bent hanger or derailleur. If you can physically shift the derailleur to all the cogs with your hand on the derailleur then you should change the cable. I'm assuming that your gears used to all work and that you haven't messed with the limit screws. A good way to check your limit screws is with the cable detached from the derailleur and then push the derailleur with your hand as far inside as it can and let it drop as far as it will. This completely eliminates cable friction. With the cable attached to the rear derailleur I like to shift the derailleur into the smallest gear in the back and then grab the cable that goes to it as it runs down the downtube and pull it until the derailleur shifts to the biggest rear gear, this is the best way test for the L limit screw and it prestretches the cable, so won't have to adjust it as soon. I learned this from a Mavic neutral support mechanic. 

When you exercise your muscles burn two fuels; a) fat b) glycogen Glycogen is carbohydrate stored in the muscles. Glycogen is quick and easy to metabolise, fat is slow and hard. Your body burns these fuels at different rates depending on how intensely you are working. At a low heart rate you burn more fat than glycogen. At high heart rate you start burning more glycogen because the rate at which you can metabolise fat isn't enough to supply the necessary energy. Its worth noting that the body still burns more fat and total calories at higher heart rates, so high intensity exercise will still burn more fat than low intensity exercise for the same amount of time exercised ...and here is the key. You can keep up low intensity exercise for much longer than you can high intensity exercise. Double the time at half the intensity will burn more fat overall. The answer therefore is to take regular long rides (2 hours or more) at low heart rate (heart rate zone 2). Try and do 3 or 4 long rides a week. To get this right you might want to invest in a heart rate monitor. I would disagree with those suggesting high intensity exercise. All this does is quickly exhaust your glycogen and that's going to stop you exercising and make you want to eat more (when your glycogen levels get low your body releases chemicals that make you crave carbohydrates). 2 hours at zone 2 will not exhaust your glycogen so you should not feel the need to eat more. I would agree with those suggesting you also improve your diet. Its easy to reduce your total calorie intake by cutting out the crap, eg sugary soft drinks, crisps and other snacks. 

Also a potential problem with having the brake levers too close to the bars is that cables stretch, calipers and levers flex, etc. So the amount of braking force that would give you say 2mm between the bar and lever when doing moderate braking on a flat road with no loading might have the lever touching the handlebar if you're doing emergency braking when a car pulls out in front of you while you're going down a steep hill with an extra 20 lbs in a messenger bag. Unfortunately, there's no hard and fast rule for how much clearance to have. There's a lot of variables, but I've always tried to have at least a fingerwidth (a centimeter or so) between the lever and bar. I certainly wouldn't want to go under 5mm. As @altomnr wrote you have to stay on top of adjusting the brakes to compensate for pad wear when you run the brake adjusters on the loose side. 

I got a flat yesterday morning after a normal ride, walked my bike inside the house and propped it upside-down (like this) overnight. This morning, I changed the flat and put on some brand new tires I bought last week. When I take it out for a ride, I find that the freewheel is nearly locked up! I can forcibly move it by dragging on the pedals and bunching-up the chain, but it's not easy. I've tried adjusting the tension on my quick-release, but that doesn't seem to make a difference. The freewheel on my SRAM S27 has always been tight (to the point of putting some slack in the chain when back-pedaling), but now I can't even coast! How did this happen, and what should I do about it? Edit - the next day: I made my adjustments on Tuesday morning as I said in the comments, but after only a 15 mile ride the freehub was completely tightened back up again! After looking into it a bit more carefully, I found a service manual for my wheels with some nice pictures. Here's what I adjusted on Tuesday morning: 

I worked in a bike shop around 1990 assembling new bikes. Adjusting the hubs was one of the steps we did. They were typically too tight from the factory. I never heard of missing balls, but I didn't look inside the hubs. It sounds like someone didn't do their job at the original shop and at wherever the hubs were made. We sold a lot of Giants, they were pretty new in the country then. We would always peel off the little Made in Taiwan sticker off the headtube. 

What kind of dropout did you have welded back in your frame when you had it repaired? A higher quality dropout might be in order. 

Those scratches are due to the chain rubbing as it shifts between chainrings. They are more noticeable on your bike than most because you have black chain rings. A Park chain wear gauge is a good way to tell if your chain is worn. Alternatively, you can measure with a ruler as described, but it's much easier if you remove it from the bike. The figure I use was 1/8" of chain stretch per foot was too much. If you let the chain stretch too much it will wear out your cassette as well. 

It also sounds like you need to learn a bit about maintenance and put the effort in. The grind and scrape is probably because your chain is filthy. With that mileage you need to clean and oil the chain every week (I do mine on Friday evening so I can enjoy it at its best on the weekend rides). A chain/cassette should last you 10,000 miles if it is looked after. Buy a Park Tools chain cleaner from wiggle, its less than £20 and means you can clean your chain in 5 mins. Every couple of months you should also give your front and rear mechs a thorough clean and lube, this includes taking the jockey wheels off. Learn to set them up so that you can shift cleanly. Lastly it sounds like in your mind you've already made the decision to buy a high end bike and are just trying to justify it to yourself. Fair enough, I'd love a bike like that, but you really don't need it. Background: I commute about 100 miles/week on an alu framed Bianchi with Veloce groupset. A new chain and cassette costs about £50 and will last me two years. 

Back in the seventies and eighties it wasn't uncommon to remove the inner chainring from bikes used on flat time trials to save weight. Often the chain length was set intentionally on the long side to reduce friction, which had the undesirable side effect of making it easier to rop the chain. At the same time it was generally considered to be a good idea to NOT remove the front derailler and to use it as a chain keeper. I believe this is mentioned in the Eddy B. book. I think you need to put the front derailleur back on your bike as a chain keeper. You probably don't need the shifter/cable, etc. just use the limit screws to keep it in a position where it doesn't rub the chain. 

I want to say one word to you. Just one word. Rollers. Riding off road will help too, but learning to ride rollers comfortably will take your balance to another level and greatly enhance your ability to recover from the unexpected: blowouts, sand, getting bumped.
