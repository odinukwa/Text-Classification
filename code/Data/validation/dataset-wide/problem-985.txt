Based on the Theis equation, increasing the transmissivity will increase the radius of influence and decrease the total drawdown. Drawdown is directly proportional to the pumping rate and inversely proportional to aquifer transmissivity and storativity. $$s = \frac{Q}{4T\pi}\int_u^\infty \frac{e^{-y}}y dy$$ and $$u = \frac{r^{2}s}{4Tt}$$ Where s is drawdown, r is radius from well, t is time, T is transmissivity, Q is pumping rate, and u is the well function. Applying this equation, you can produce plots like this: for these plots, I used Q = 500, S = 0.01, and t = 4 

Crystal settling - various mineral have differing melting/solidifying temperatures, allowing for a process of distillation where magma can gradually be made more felsic (from basalt-like to rhyolite-like) Inclusion of country rock (aka assimilation) - where crustal material is incorporated and melted into the magma Partial melting - where only the part of the rock material is melted 

Because of variations in temperature, depth of emplacement, thickness of the crust, heterogeneity in the mantle, and variations in the magma distillation process, each volcano has a unique geochemical signature. However, volcanoes in similar tectonic settings have similar geochemistry. Geochemistry of magma starts out as ultramafic when sourced from the mantle. However, the mantle is not entirely homogeneous, which is evident from the presence of hot spots and other thermal and gravitational variations. Ultramafic magma rising from the solid mantle can be generated by decompression (thinning of the crust) or by the introduction of a contaminant (water from subducting plates). Once the mantle melt reaches the base of the crust, it's geochemistry can change via three different processes: 

It can happen but not like you may guess. I believe you have seen rupture maps for large earthquakes, such as the 2011 Japan earthquake. In that earthquake, a foreshock of 7.3 took place at the perimeter of the area of largest slip during the main earthquake. This could be interpreted like this (using the asperity model): the foreshock hit at the "slopes" of the asperity but failed to "climb" up immediately; aftershocks were slowly migrating towards the "top" of the asperity, then the main shock happened. Furthermore, once the whole fault was activated, slip at the shallowest parts went beyond charts (40, 50, even 80m of slip were reported locally). The main (deep) asperity had the fewest aftershocks (it slipped completely and without restraints), but there were enough of them in the shallowest parts of the fault. This is probably because the shallower slip was not due to an asperity but rather due to diffused slip of unconsolidated sediments (the "bookshelf" model was used, plus there were aftershocks that appeared to actually... pull back the pieces closer to their original locations). Anyways let's focus on the deeper asperity. An earthquake can take place at the "slopes" of a large asperity but fail to rupture towards the "top" It can however rupture towards the perimeter and achieve respectable sizes. Then another earthquake can take place nearby, but still low at the "slopes". Finally an earthquake can climb over the top and force even the previously ruptured areas to re-rupture. All 3 earthquakes can very well have epicenters pretty close to one another (such as the two eastern Nepal aftershocks recently). It seems that the 1960 huge Valdivia earthquake demonstrated this behavior but I have yet to find a good, detailed, open-access study on it. Concerning Fred's answer, unfortunately Bilham (he mentions Jones and Molnar, 1986) (search for "preceded") says that 10% of strong earthquakes in the history of Himalaya have been preceded by strong shocks. Other sources support Fred's answer, but I would choose to believe Bilham. Concerning the "lots of aftershocks" notice that the author of the question pointed, for a given earthquake with a normal aftershock sequence it is expected that its strongest aftershock is 1.2 magnitude smaller than the mainshock. For this case, this would yield 6.6. In fact, the strongest ones were the 7.3, an 6.7 and a 6.6, so yes this is anomalous, but the empirical 1.2 value I mentioned is a bit smaller for Himalayas. Still, an 7.3 is anomalously large but before that time we had no reason to suspect an anomalous aftershock sequence (to my knowledge of course, I searched for b-values but did not find anything during the first days of aftershock activity). 

I have seen several graphs showing the prehistoric temperatures and CO2 concentrations derived from ice-core data. My understanding is that CO2 and temperature correlate. I assume that Milankovich Cycles are what caused the variations observed in temperature in the ice record, but what specifically caused the CO2 to fluctuate? 

I was unaware of a 0.5 mm maximum rule with ooid size. The Sam Boggs Jr. book on Principals of Sedimentology and Stratagraphy indicates that ooids can grow up to 2 mm. Grains larger than this are pisoids. The size limitation may depend on how you define an ooid. To me, an ooid carbonate grain with a nucleus and concentric layers of calcite or aragonite. The size is likely a function of the availability of calcium and carbonate ions in the water (calcite or aragonite saturation). I think that microbial action also contributes to large grain size, but if microbes are involved, then you might call it an oncoid instead. The similarity of ooid size is a function of similarities in the environment of deposition. Microfacies of Carbonate Rocks by Erik Flugel is a great book that discusses these features in detail. 

There already exists at least one method that attempts to use electromagnetic precursors to earthquakes; it actually tries to detect electrical currents running up through active faults, explained by the piezoelectric phenomenon. Search for Varotsos if you want, perhaps there are other approaches as well. Even though the device has a very long "antenna" (ie it tries to avoid noise which usually has shorter wavelengths) it has had some false positives (power lines may produce signals as well, they are long and signals may be of low frequency. Personally I would never focus on short wavelengths such as TV frequencies. Varotsos correctly focused on low frequencies (there is a practical limit to the size of the "antenna", I think it is some 50-100 meters long). So in short, no, TV disturbances will never become a valid earthquake precursor. Too many false positives would ruin it. Keep in mind that in the aforementioned approach, the first signal comes perhaps 4 months before the earthquake and further signals and seismic data are used in order to further narrow the time window, which right now is in the order of days to weeks. However the location and depth are pretty inaccurate (100 km radius or more) while the magnitude may be almost 1 unit lower (the most recent "success" had a magnitude 0.8 lower but it was a doublet). Currently there is an active "prediction" for an earthquake 100 km around Athens, of magnitude near 6. If it is to come true, it should happen until June or early July, but there are dozens of capable faults within the radius so it is practically useless at this point. 

Was the first crust entirely mafic (oceanic) crust which was later distilled via volcanic arcs along subduction zones to make felsic rocks or did the earth start with bits of felsic crust? Are the ancient zircons most likely from felsic or mafic rocks? 

Crystal settling and partial melting follow the Bowen's reaction series (pictured), which tells you which minerals melt at which temperatures. This is essentially the same process of distillation of alcohol by separating it from water, which has a lower temperature of vaporization. Each of these processes allows for a unique rock chemistry, even within the same batholith. While we categorize magmas into different groups based on their geochemistry, we must keep in mind that the geochemistry of any igneous rock falls along a sliding (not discrete) scale (i.e. not every granite is the same). Otherwise igneous petrology would be really easy. See the wikipedia article on igneous differentiation for more information. 

Based on the brassy color, it's metallic luster, and it's resistance to breakage, I would say it's pyrite. Try to scratch glass with it (be careful not to break the glass). If it scratches, it is likely pyrite. If a nail can't scratch it, it is likely pyrite. You could test it's streak by rubbing it on a piece of hard unglazed ceramic. If it leaves a black mark (maybe with a hint of green), then it is likely pyrite. $URL$ Edit: Based on a approximate volume of 458 mL (that of the Monster), which is 458 cm3, and the density of pyrite of 5 gm/cm3, then sample should weigh about 2.3 kg (5 lbs). Galena (see wienein comment below), a less brassy and less hard (easier to scratch) metallic mineral, has a higher density of 7.6 gm/cm3, which would give is a mass of 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs), closer to what you are showing in the picture. Galena has a light grey streak and contains lead. 

I guess that it is possible. As mentioned by others, on top of static stress triggering, which is the effect of an earthquake in its vicinity (typically up to 2-3 rupture lengths away), another way by which an earthquake can trigger others is by dynamic stress triggering, which may have effects farther away but are hard to identify and measure. So far, the only earthquake that seems to have demonstrated how dynamic triggering over long distances can take place is the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquakes. This earthquake had an unusual combination of characteristics: it was a very large strike-slip earthquake, it took place in oceanic crust (which allows surface waves to travel longer) and had a very large concentrated burst of Mw 8.4 - 8.5 with large slip over limited distance (I do not post sources since there are at least 3 apparently good studies with very different results, for example one study says that slip exceeded 80m locally (!)). These characteristics suggest that this earthquake was very efficient at radiating energy through the crust rather than towards the interior or through very fragmented crust. So, what this earthquake showed, is that it is possible to speed up significant earthquakes (earthquakes that were almost ready to happen, but they were sped up up to 90 days). Still, it is only one case, the mechanism is not well understood, we are not sure why this earthquake seemed to have caused this phenomenon while other earthquakes with higher magnitudes did not show the same effects. Concluding, while static stress triggering has only a fairly local effect, dynamic stress triggering may have a wider effect but we only have detected one such case, which could very well have been a coincidence or due to an unusual mechanism. So the answer to your question seems to be yes, but with doubts and in any case for very special earthquakes.
