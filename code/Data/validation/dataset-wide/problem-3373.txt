You can say ninakupenda(,) Kifaru "I love you, Rhino", just as you can say ninakupenda(,) Malaika "I love you, Malaika". The post-verbal NP is not an argument, and the structure is exactly like "I love you, Lucy". Ninakipenda kifaru is kind of dicey, since the agreement should be class 1, since rhinos are animate. However, there is a fair amount of dialect / individual variation on that point. And it would not mean "I love you, Rhino", it would mean "I love a/the rhino". Noun class is indicated only on 3rd person objects. So for example ninakupenda kibiriti "I love you, matches". 

Edit: Based on your later replies, I think I understand the distinction you're looking for. Words and morphemes can be organized hierarchically in terms of what things / actions / states they refer to. For instance, "mammal" refers to a very large set of warm-blooded animals, and the term subsumes "goat", "reindeer", "sheep" and other things under one word. In English, we just have "reindeer", but in North Saami, there are dozens of terms for reindeer depending on sex, age, and body properties (there is also a general word boadzu that simply means 'reindeer'). Thus the entities identified by "reindeer" in English can be further subdivided by selecting one word vs. another in N. Saami, and N. Saami has a "more-nuanced" vocabulary for reindeer: the set of real-world things identified by English "reindeer" can be further distinguished in N. Saami by selecting other words. Similarly, in Somali, there is a word ari which refers to goats and sheep, so English is "more nuanced" in terms of these animal identifications (there is no common English term generalizing over goats and sheep, though there is a Latin terms that biologists can use, Caprinae). The Somali term *ari *is a superset of goat and sheep. This kind of subset / superset analysis can be applied to any collection of words and morphemes, hence 3rd person pronouns may simply be undiftinguished "3rd person", or they can be further distinguished "singular and plural", or "masculine and feminine", and that allows further distinctions "masculine singular", "feminine plural" and so on. There are many, many ways of subdividing concepts. English pronouns distinguishes between male and female singular 3rd person referents, and Saami does not. Languages do not differ in their net expressive capacity, so where they can use a single word-choice between vuonjal and varit, we would have to use phrases like "female reindeer between a year and a half old and two years old" and "male reindeer between a year and a half old and two years old". I don't see any realistic hope of computing a general "degree of nuance" value for two entire languages (nor do I see that it would tell us anything about the languages -- just because you can define a function doesn't mean that it refers to something useful). One problem would be in comparing a tense-based inflectional system versus as aspect-based system. In the cases of 3rd person pronouns, reindeer, and goats, we were dealing with subset relations in the referents, but the things that perfective / imperfective refers to is incommensurable with what past / present / future refers to. 

It's difficult to tell what exactly you're talking about -- not the semi-sinusoidal part in the waveform at the end of EH1, and not the pattern of 4 dots throughout the spectrogram (the formants). If you could use a drawing program to circle the stuff in question, that would be useful. The roundest thing at the end of the selection (EH1) is in the waveform, and that is basically the last few flops of the vocal folds vibrating during /ð/, but with most of the energy at the fundamental. [EDIT] If you mean rows and not columns, then I assume that is the small red dots, which are marks (formant tracking is on). If you meant columns, and there are about 7 of them visible near the circles you drew, those are individual harmonics. You also see them at regular intervals in the light areas before the circled part. I put in vertical lines separating the things I think you're talking about. 

The first step, I suppose, is to re-state what fact about "answer to a question" refers to constituency (and likewise the other tests). Look at any other two-word sequence, like hermana me, traido un, mapa de and so on, and see if that fact holds. For some of these word pairs, that relationship does not hold. Questions about "syntactic function" would have to refer to whatever theory of syntactic function your instruction subscribes to. Identifying ambiguities is a native-like speaker magic skill, and sometimes people just can see the other interpretation(s), probably because the alternative interpretation seems silly (e.g. the ambiguity of "he sold a ticket to my boss"). 

The distinction is theory-specific, and makes sense only where there is a clear distinction between different "things". The strings [abcdef] and [bacdef] have a syntagmatic relationship made up of 6 distinct things in a particular order. The strings [abcdef] and [abcdex] have a paradigmatic relationship, where one unit is replaced by another in the pair. The problem is that in most theories of phonology, what look like nominally different "things" like [d] vs [t] are not completely unrelated, [d] is just [t] combined with something more (that is, they are syntagmatically related). 

I looked at the SO discussion (and admit that I can't compute the consequences of all of the code). Those guys even admit that hyphenation solutions can't handle quasi-novel data (such as names of Welsh origin). Linguists can contribute linguistic clarity to the discussion. I maintain that the SO answers do not yield correct syllabification, since syllabification and hyphenation are not the same thing. For example, in the SO OP's question, s/he gives the example in-vi-sib-le, where the penult is closed with /b/ and the final syllable is "le", whatever that means. The standard understanding over the past almost 40 years is that this word is syllabified [ɪn.vɪ.zə.bl̩] or [ɪn.vɪ.zə<.>b<.>l̩], where "<.>b<.>l̩" is a clunky way of writing ambisyllabic b. The major premise is that the procedure would map (spelled) words from text to ?transcribed strings with syllable boundaries, and a minor premise (which I think we should assume the OP had in mind) is that the procedure would do so just on the basis of the letters -- rather than e.g. calling up a hyphenated dictionary and inserting syllable boundaries where there are hyphens (a fairly obvious kludge). English syllabification is partly sensitive to stress, especially to get the correct intervocalic syllabification of consonants. Just based on spelling, you can't automatically compute the stress difference between "latest" and "latex", or "tigress" and "progress". I argue that the answer is, "no, it cannot be done", assuming a self-contained linguistic approach to the problem. (That is, without linking the procedure to an external phonetically-transcribed dictionary or similar object; and without hard-coding a long list of words where the algorithm fails). The primary reason why it would fail in principle is that syllabification isn't based on spelling. The secondary reason why it would fail is because it isn't even clear to linguists what the answer should be. For instance, in many dialects of American English, it's impossible to determine how many syllables there are in towel, foul -- could be 1, could be two. There is much debate over how intervocalic consonants are to be syllabified (is the first syllable of "hammer" closed? does the second syllable have an onset consonant?). 

You would need to explain what you mean by "juncture", since it doesn't refer to an objective observable (it's sometimes used as a term covering a method of describing various facts). As far as I know, no introductory phonology text discusses "juncture", though there might be some general introduction from the 50's that discusses it. The concept has mostly disappeared from linguistics. Given the example that you mention, which matches the structuralist examples of "juncture", a "juncture" is an abstract symbol such as "+", "=", "#" which rules of allophony could refer to, to get the hard-to-describe difference between "Nye-trait" and "night-rate". In contemporary theories, "juncture" has been replaced primarily with notions of syllabification, and to a lesser extent "prosodic phrasing" especially for intonation. Prosodic phrasing is a fairly advanced topic which isn't usually covered in introductory phonology textbooks, but syllabification could be. IMO the best coverage of those syllabification phenomena covered by "juncture" is in Daniel Kahn's dissertation; but it is difficult to follow. In other words, there isn't an ideal reading, but there might be an okay one, depending on whether you're interested in theories of how syllables are constructed, or in what positing syllables can do for you in describing certain phonological and phonetic variations.
