Officially it collapsed after falling to Napoleon with the 4th treaty of Pressburg, but had been fading for some time before that. The empire was pretty decentrized in nature, but various events such as the Peace of Westphalia after the thirty years war, which granted dominions effectively independence in all but name. Nations, especially the Hapsburgs in Austria, looking to consolidate their own domains over that of the empires, and the thwarting of policies that would have brought more centralization to the empire's rule. 

According to wikipedia, Steel has been around since antiquity, but reference to steel weapons can be found in 4th century BC Ibernia, Romans, and in Chinese references during their Warring States era. The steel that we think of today was originally made East Africa by the Haya people over two eons ago, but wouldn't be rediscovered until the Industrial revolution. Before then, what we think of that makes the weapons and buildings that we see didn't' really exist. 

Thailand converted over from Siam after the revolution of 1932, where the nations military staged a coup against the monarchy and established a constitutional style monarchy (although it ended up being decades of military rule). While there was a brief return to using the Siam moniker after WWII, the new name for the country stuck. A more detailed version of the Revolution of 1932 can be found here. 

Was watching the directors cut of Kingdom of Heaven, and one of the scenes had an actor playing what seemed to be a nobelman stating that he is according the privilege of ransom. While I remember that being so in my readings, in this scene, he was killed instead. What my question is were nobles more likely to be ransomed when captured in battle (such as Richard the Lionheart to use a famous example), offed unless they were extremely high ranking such as a King or Duke, or a halfway point between the two? 

I think it is safe to say, however, that the main language of this congress too, was German with a Hebrew translation of the protocols added. Skimming through the protocol, the majority of the speakers in the congress are marked as coming from Zürich, Köln, Berlin, Bingen, Wien, Frankfurt, Prague etc. where German would be the primary language. Most of those who were not from a German speaking area, very likely knew German: 

As one might expect, it is a tricky business to talk generally about practices on the Indian subcontinent. For most things that is as true today as it is for the subcontinent of centuries ago. The diversity of religions, cultures, languages, and the complex political realities over the centuries means that this answer really must be more of a sampling of the variety of practices. Below I offer a sampling of what I have found on the practice of rest days in Indian Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Jewish Indians, Hindu festivals, possibly regional rest days, and conclude with possible emergence of greater standardization with British colonial rule. Uposatha and the Claim of Earliest Rest Days The closest I came to something pointing to a very ancient origin is in an article by Bruce A. Kimball. I think this quote is also important because it points to the connection between feast days, taboos surrounding them, and rest days: 

It looks like he did spend those years in Iceland. There are a few pages discussing his time there from 1515 in volume 3 of Historisk arkiv (Gbooks), p403-406 De tre nordiske rigers historie under Hans by Carl Ferdinand Allen (Gbooks) pages 143-144 suggests that he did spend time there (without much detail about his stay). The phrasing of a sentence in Danmarks historie by Ole Feldbæk (Gbooks) p65 also implies that he was based in Iceland until 1517 but then called south to help in the war against Sweden, which is discussed in somewhat different terms in the above Historisk arkiv pages. 

Propaganda is an invention of the 20th century. It is the application of behavioral psychology and modern linguistic philosophy that saw rhetoric more widely intentionally applied to other symbols than only language, such as posters, movies, and newspapers. Propaganda was widely used during WWI to improve morale at home and target enemy morale. This is from the seminal work on the subject. "Propaganda", Edward Bernays, 1912 

(Apologies for so much cut and paste) There are many other theorists that have looked at the reasons for the cycles of peace and war in societies, as well, but I suggest starting here. 

The Romans did still use formal logic in rhetoric but not at all to the same degree as the Greeks had. They no longer believed it could uncover the truth through debate, so this emphasis was lost. 

This is a really complicated question. I will try to be brief. In order to discuss corn its relevant to discuss other major crops. The reason is that farmers choose to grow things that will compliment another thing to prevent soil erosion and lower costs. 

The power of discourse is coming from what he calls discursive formations, described in this same book, The Archeology of Knowledge. (Razie is obviously a big fan!) Discursive formations were also discussed on philsophy.SE 

There's really two questions here. How does propaganda work and what did the German's know about how it worked? What is Propaganda Applied rhetorics for the persuasion of mass audiences through the use of mass media for the purposes of commercial interests (eg advertising, public relations) or to persuade audiences to support a cause or to hurt support for the opposing side's cause (war-time, political, advocacy, lobbying) Different Avenues of Propaganda There are avenues of propaganda: white, grey and black propaganda. White propaganda is when the source of the propaganda is known and black is when the source is a lie. Grey is when the source unknown. Usually when we think of the word "propaganda" we think of black propaganda, but white sources are very common and also effective. Goebbels is an example of white propaganda. The White House press secretary is another example, although I'm not trying to draw a direct parallel. Advertising is another white source and quite effective. Maybe we don't think of advertising as "propaganda" but we know its advertising, and it still helps companies sell products. Therefore, propaganda absolutely does not need to hide its source to be effective. Title of Ministry of Propaganda Germany was ground-breaking in the field of propaganda in the early 20th century. America had a negative attitude towards it even during WWI and limited its use. American intellectuals developed a model based on a poor understanding of human behavior that envisioned propaganda directly entering the audiences thoughts and influencing them directly without any feedback or interpretation by the audience. Therefore the American interpretation of propaganda was as a very dangerous weapon that could destroy democracy. The German interpretation was not nearly so dire. Propaganda can also be seen as a tool to spread positive political ideas. We use propaganda today this way although we do not call it by that name due to the negative connotation. It might be best to translate Goebbels as the head of the "Ministry of Public Information" or "Ministry for Advocacy for the Interests of German Peoples" to understand how the German people would have understood him. 

This touches upon a really fascinating cluster of debates in the history of the late colonial period and the early republic. There are likely many publications on this but it forms one of the central issues in: 

Finally, Stivers makes a complex argument, not considered in detail here, that the conclusion of the crisis, which hinged on the Soviet dropping of its demands, especially regarding the currency in West Berlin, came partly as a result of British resistance to certain aspects of American demands, and stalling actions by the British and French up to a point where the demand simply made little sense anymore, thus easing the way for a resolution to the crisis. The period of the blockade brought about changes in the economic environment and decreased the interdependency of the two sides to a point where the restoration of the pre-crisis state was increasingly unlikely. [1:602] 

The "first meeting of industrial workers in Bombay's history" in 1884 passed a resolution asking for a full day of rest on Sunday [10:328] and an "Act of 1891" made Sunday a day of rest in factories [11:230] Overall, it would appear that in some areas or among some religious groups there are more regular festivals or religious days, with some cases of more frequent regular days of rest such as the observed weekly day of rest in Mysore, or the almost weekly Uposatha in some places like Sri Lanka, or the Gahambars of the Zoroastrians.

The chapter on the impact on Great Britain in The Impact of the American Revolution Abroad concludes with: 

Emphasis by me on the key line, which may have something to do with it. This is the only entry for 1928 (which as @Henry points out, is right in the midst of the Northern Expedition unification effort). Basically this says there is a 1928 shift in control from the former central astronomical institution (中央觀象台) to have its duties divided between the new Nanjing government's astronomical research institute (天文研究所) and its meteorology research institute (氣象研究所). While latter two based their almanac on the work of the previous one, they no longer use Beiping (now again called Beijing) standard time for time zone calculations but use Nanjing standard time It says at 120° but that is not Nanjing but more like halfway between Shanghai (around 121°) and Nanjing (118-119°). It is, however, further east than the old capital Beijing (around 116°ish) Not entirely clear to me exactly how this worked since I thought there would have to be some standardization with other non-Chinese timezones, but it is all I was able to find with a quick search on the Chinese side of this discussion. I looked through the December 31, 1927 and January 1, 1928 issue of the Shanghai based Shenbao (申報) newspaper but didn't find any articles warning its readers of the coming time change. 

I believe there is common confusion that Hitler's antisemitism developed later because the Freikorps were not antisemitic originally. 

Magellan's wife and children weren't hostages for use as insurance or blackmail. The King of Portugal was attempting to kill Magellan. He destroyed the family castle in Portugal, sent assassins after Magellan and even sent ships after the fleet to stop the voyage. The location of Magellan's wife, Beatriz Barbosa, during the voyage is not clear from the couple's correspondence but it seems most likely to be with her father at their family home, not at court under the watchful eye of the Spanish king. Her father, Diego Barbosa frequented the king's court, so of course it seems possible that her father was helping to keep an eye on her safety and that of their young son for the king. 

Henry A. Wallace was Roosevelt's vice-president during WWII. Shortly before Roosevelt's death (82 days) following a slow decline in health, the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party started an anti-Wallace Movement to nominate anyone else as vice-president for Roosevelt's third term, thus selecting the unlikely Truman as the next president of the US. Was this movement related to Wallace being too soft on the new Communist threat? Being too close to labor? Caused by his eccentric personality or political scandals? What about Wallace caused such a backlash against him? 

(Note: "Collapse" should be taken to mean a loss of complexity. "Dissolve" means an increase of complexity. My definitions don't make great sense, but I feel we need some) The number one reason states collapse or peacefully dissolve and are added to other states, including military reasons is: The inability to adapt and react to change, or more commonly known as Gross Ineptitude, Mismanagement and Political Corruption There are many theories concerning how and why this occurs. First the WHY This is not the best source, I apologize, but the conclusions we can draw from it will be pretty much the same.

Other factors may include the relatively stable and early migration/control by the Chinese into Hainan (despite limited control over the Li in the mountainous areas) in 110BC [4:390], vs. first notice of Taiwan by Chinese imperial records in 230AD [3:35] with migration much much later. Early control and administration made Hainan less vulnerable to invasions. Hainan also fell under French "sphere of influence" in late 19th century which was recognized by treaties with the Qing and Japan, and perhaps saved it from the early 20th century turmoil (up to Japanese invasion) [5:93-95]. This situation all changes in the 20th century. The Japanese saw Hainan's naval importance for its southern advance [5:93] and kept it under full direct control instead of turning it over to Wang Jingwei's administration [5:99]. This is again true after WWII, as Hainan was among last territories to fall to the Communists with the massive naval attack in spring 1950, and later Hainan becomes a strategically vital area in tensions between China and Vietnam (west coast of Hainan has many naval basis) and as administratively connected to China's claims on the potentially petroleum rich reserves in the South China Seas [4:167] Notes above done as: [Source Number:Page Number] Sources
