Part of it depends on what you mean by merge. English has elements of Welsh and Gaelic in it, but Welsh and Gaelic are still spoken separately after 1500 years of close proximity. However, very few people speak only Welsh or Gaelic. Most everyone who speaks one of those speaks English as well. The historical King Arthur was a Welsh king (Arth is Welsh for bear and ursus is the Latin word). One of his most famous successes was taking the "sword" from the Angles and the Saxons, which was later miscopied as taking the sword from the anvil and the stone. Anyway, that was prior to 500 AD, so more than 1500 years ago. Perhaps even more than 1600 years ago, records are rather weak that far back. Your tribes seem at least as hostile to each other as the Welsh and Scots to the Angles. Unless they became significantly less hostile to each other, it seems quite possible that their languages would stay distinct. In our world, the Welsh and the Angles settled into their own peace with trade, etc. As the Welsh and the Romans worked together to resist the Angles and the Saxons, the Welsh joined with the Angles to resist Viking raiding parties and Norman conquest. All this pushed them together into what language merging did occur. 

Magical magic Magic can be magical even if fully understood. Consider a magic system that works based on belief. If someone is alone, her own beliefs determine how it works. If she joins someone else, their beliefs compromise. Behavior is different. In that system, results will be non-reproducible. To get identical results, you need the same beliefs. That's not achievable with different personnel. Even if the same people try to reproduce a study, their beliefs may have evolved over time. This can lead to different results, particularly if the experiment is sensitive to small changes. Magic would work differently for different people in such a world. It can even work differently depending on who is present for the experiment. Scientific magic Things that we'd call magic can also follow clear, quantifiable rules. It can work the same for everyone. In that case, "magic" would become part of the science. 

Less investment The more money that people have, the more they can save and invest. So for most people who lose money, they will save and invest more. However, the average wage is less than the amount where people save a lot. Unfortunately, this means that most people who gain money won't save significantly more. The net result will be a fall in investment and an increase in consumption. More inflation An increase in consumption without a corresponding increase in the capital stock to improve production will cause inflation. This will be exacerbated by the loss of capital stock from the fall in savings, which will cause production to fall. Note that inflation makes people poorer, so they save even less. Drop in work If everyone has the same income regardless of whether they are working or not, most people won't work. There will be exceptions. Writers may continue to write. Artists may continue to make art in general. Athletes may continue to play sports. But why be a garbage man? In fact, why do any of the unpleasant parts of any job? Even if you set things so that everyone who works has the same income but people who don't work don't, the same problem exists. There'll be a lot of people for some jobs and hardly any for others. The disliked jobs will have to reduce hours to make them more attractive. The net result of this is another drop in production. Which means more inflation. Free education Education would have to be free under this scenario. There's no incentive for people to pay for an education. They can get the same income without education. Note that people getting an education would have to get an income as well. Otherwise they are effectively paying for the privilege of getting an education. Lower incomes In the short term, nominal incomes will rise for most people. This is because the average income is higher than the median income. So for most people incomes will seem to go up. But inflation will eat up the increase. Worse, falling production will cause incomes to fall from that initial value. Increased corruption There will be a lot of incentives for people to try to game the system. If there is no garbage pickup, you have to take the garbage to the dump yourself. But what if instead you pay your neighbor a couple bucks to take your garbage with his? He pockets the money without reporting it as income. Want a good job? Kick a bit back to the person responsible for hiring. Note that in general there's no point in starting an honest business. You get the same income either way. So all new businesses will be corrupt. Bad, very bad It's a negative cycle. Investment would fall, causing production to fall, causing incomes to fall, causing investment to fall, and round we go again. The consequences are bad, unabashedly bad. A one-time transfer I've analyzed this assuming that "all income for each person is the same" means that you are going to maintain this. If instead you meant to say that incomes will stay the same as they are now rather than the same as each other, this would just be a one-time transfer. In that case, the near term effect is that savings will drop. This is because people lose money exclusively from savings while the people who gain can save or consume. Again, this will cause a drop in investment. Over time, some people will blow their windfall. Others will save most of theirs. There will be a short term inflation effect. Longer term there is the problem that people may wonder if you'll do it again. If so, they'll likely save less (or save in ways that aren't subject to this). Note that if you give every person an equal share of all the cash in the US, that's only \$3800 per person. That's not enough to make a significant investment. It is enough for people to make a significant purchase. The result is mostly bad. Savings and investment down. Current inflation and consumption up. Future consumption is lower, as people won't be able to finance it out of their savings. The only good result in that last is the increase in current consumption. That will produce increase incomes for someone. Mostly those rich enough to own stocks or businesses. The middle class will be the worst hit. The rich don't keep most of their savings in banks. They buy stocks and stuff instead. The poor don't have any savings. Short term, the poor will get the most benefit. Longer term, the rich will get most of the profits. This will increase wealth inequality, which would seem to be the opposite of the intent. 

Dangerous So how does that apply to law enforcement? Let's start with the last point. Police work can be dangerous. It involves preventing people from doing what they want. Some people will react violently to this. Better A corollary of the danger issue is that robots can react less violently. One of the main reasons that police use violence is to prevent violence done to them. A robot could allow itself to be destroyed in a situation where a police officer might feel compelled to shoot. This makes the robots better in those situations. Robots also have the potential to do things like on-the-spot analysis of fingerprints or forensic evidence that an officer might need a specialist to do. Not for the equipment but for the training. And of course robots are not emotionally impacted the same way that humans are. This allows them to respond more dispassionately. Robots can be controlled remotely more effectively than humans. Their communication protocols can be more efficient than verbal reports and orders. Live sound and video from the robot; efficient digital commands in response. Robots follow their programming more than humans follow protocols. For example, the Freddie Gray case was caused in part by a failure to follow the official rules in securing a prisoner. A robot wouldn't have done that. Once their programming is updated, they will follow the new programming. They won't continue to do things the way that they always have. Robots also won't disable their cameras. Cheaper Humans cost a certain amount per year to hire. Don't forget the costs of pensions and insurance in that number. It's quite possible for a police officer to cost \$100,000 (US) a year even if only making \$20 an hour. If you can lease and maintain a robot for less, that allows the agency to either save money or increase their presence. A ten year, $3 million lease for a robot that operates 24x7 may actually be cheaper than hiring three or four officers for the same period. Robots might integrate better with vehicles. Currently a motorcycle officer rides a motorcycle. The robot version might be an attachment. Robots might use such smaller vehicles rather than big, blocky, fuel-guzzling cars. Or an entire group might ride a single pickup truck. Robots can power down when not in use. It's easier to maintain reserves that way. Activate them in response to calls. Humans would have to be given make work in a similar situation. You can't really tell them that you don't feel like paying them this month, not enough crime. But stick around, we may have more crime next month. Other Note that we already replace humans with robots in some circumstances. There are robots that disarm bombs now. They are currently rather stupid, being essentially remote operated. Traffic cameras can be considered robotic replacements of traffic officers. A parking monitor robot might make sense. I thought that the show Almost Human did a good job of integrating androids into the police force. They took the risks and allowed single human officers to go about safely with android partners.
