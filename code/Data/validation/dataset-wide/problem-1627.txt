It's quite plausible. The 'fog' which surrounded the iceberg may have been a mirage caused by super-refraction. The British Government's 1992 MAIB report posits the presence of super-refraction as a possible explanation for why CALIFORNIAN could see TITANIC even though the two ships appear to have been beyond each other's horizons (and TITANIC could not see CALIFORNIAN): 

The Trapdoor of Trigger Words (subtitle: What the science of trauma can tell us about an endless campus debate), Katy Waldman, 5 Sept 2016, Salon.com (emphasis mine) Within this topic there is some debate over the definitions of terms such as 'trauma', as Professor Foa explains in the same article: 

Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2005-14 April 4, 2005 Rev. Rul. 2005-21 It is worth noting that there is a $5000 penalty for wasting the IRS's time by attempting to avoid paying tax using this frivolous argument - rising to $25,000 for wasting the time of the tax court by relying on this argument:

Meads, 2012 ABQB 571, Canadian Associate Chief Justice J.D. Rooke provides a useful resource for dealing with this kind of claim, which he describes as an "Organized Pseudolegal Commercial Argument" ('OPCA'). In a telling paragraph of the judgement, Justice Rooke points out that these pseudolegal arguments have never succeeded in any jurisdiction:

Conversion: With targets & incentives, new breed of evangelical groups are like start-ups, TV Mohandas Pai, Economic Times (Times of India), 27 December 2014 To put this in a broader context, the World Council of Churches (WCC) working with the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue (PCID) and the World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) has 'Recommendations for Conduct' which condemn this kind of coercion: 

There are a number of claims in the question. First I'm going to address this one: Capitalized names refer to corporate entities associated with individuals; e.g., John Doe refers to the person and JOHN DOE to the corporate entity created for John Doe. This treatment makes it appear that the government has more control than they would over a natural person. This question is answered in Daniel B. Evans's Tax Protestor FAQ: 

See also: "What has Meads v Meads wrought?", April 8, 2013, Jonnette Watson Hamilton and Alice Woolley. It's also worth noting that Anna von Reitz, the author, proclaims herself to be a judge but is not recognised as such by the mainstream legal system (source). The fallacy that the US court system secretly has no power because it is (again secretly) a maritime or military court is also addressed in the Evans Legal Tax Protestor FAQ: 

(Appendix 4, p. 30) The appendix does mention the possibility of mirages caused by super-refraction, but the report doesn't mention any possibility of these mirages causing or contributing to the accident. I've also taken a look at another, more detailed, source of the same claim (i.e the claim is being made by the same person but reported by a different media outlet): Weatherwise - Titanic's Mirage: A New Perspective on One of History's Greatest Mysteries Here "Waldemar Lehn, professor emeritus at the University of Manitoba and an expert in atmospheric refraction and mirages" explains how he believes super-refraction could have prevented the lookouts from seeing the iceberg:

Now I'm going to address this claim: Americans' civil records have been falsified - nearly all citizens have been declared "foundlings" (no legal parents on record) in order to declare us wards of the Washington DC municipal corporation and change our natural venue to international/maritime courts;

The IRS page refers to Internal Revenue Bulletin: 2010-17 April 26, 2010 Notice 2010-33, which sets out a list of "why I don't have to pay tax" arguments which the IRS considers frivolous, and explains the penalty for wasting the IRS's time in taking those positions: 

Moving on now to the remaining claim: At a meeting of the UN Trust Committee - North America, it was claimed that the States of America no longer exist and are "civilly dead" and "depopulated" and that there are no American citizens

How might it have looked? Well, it was night-time, so it probably mostly looked dark. Here's a description of how the phenomenon can look in daylight: 

The New Yorker article "Documenting Trump's Abuse of Women" (24 October 2016) recounts Trump biographer Harry Hurt III's claim that Ivana Trump said in a sworn deposition she had been raped by Donald Trump:

'Police': Sovereign Citizens: A Clear and Present Danger In summary: The implication that the US tax system "is illegal" is entirely without merit. If your colleague wants to test this statement for accuracy, they can withhold their taxes and see what happens.

Tax Protestor FAQ: "A name that is written all in capital letters (as in a court caption) is not the same as a name written in mixed case (upper and lower case)." The (entirely false) idea that the government creates a corporation corresponding to each living person, and that a particular typography of the person's name refers to the corporation rather than the living person (and therefore the living person, conveniently, doesn't have to pay any income tax) is known as the "straw man" argument, and the IRS has addressed it specifically:

On 21 Jan 2017, the White House called a press conference where the press secretary accused the media of "deliberately false reporting" on two issues of which the number of people attending President Trump's inauguration was one. The inauguration took place in Washington DC. The number of people using the Washington DC transit system on the day of the inauguration was one of the pieces of evidence which the press secretary used to support his assertion that the inauguration had had a greater attendance than the previous inauguration and that the media was deliberately misleading the public by reporting otherwise. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the following:

The claim is being made by the TUC under their campaign Playfair Qatar (name shown in some media outlets as 'Play Fair Qatar'). The specific claim they make is: 

A quick survey of possible sources suggests that cash handouts are rare but that it is very common for "benefits in kind" (such as free food, education, healthcare or travel), to be distributed only to those recipients who are prepared to convert (or to say that they have converted) to the donor organisation's preferred religion. In some cases (food, healthcare) the recipients are in a position where their lives, or those of their families, may be in jeopardy if they choose to maintain their existing religion and are thus denied access to the resources they need to live. Here are some of the sources I looked at: 

Moving on to the American Bar Association, it was founded by American lawyers in Saratoga Springs, New York (a city in the USA): 

In summary: Is the federal US government playing games with people's citizenship and human rights as indicated above? No. Are citizens "wards of the state" in any way and would this have any legal bearing on the court system's jurisdiction? No. A small number of citizens (usually children whose parents are dead or unable to care for them) are wards of court / wards of state; this does not place them outside the regular legal system. Are claims being made that the US is civilly dead and that there are no US citizens? No such claims are made by the UN (because that would be ridiculous). Are corporations created for individuals referenced by capitalized names in a move to deny rights? No. Corporations aren't created corresponding to each individual person, and it doesn't make any difference legally how a person's name is capitalised. 

On 21 Jan 2017, the White House called a press conference where the press secretary accused the media of "deliberately false reporting" on two issues of which the number of people attending President Trump's inauguration was one. The white floor covering on the National Mall on the day of the inauguration was one of the pieces of evidence which the press secretary used to support his assertion that Trump's inauguration had a greater attendance than the previous inauguration and that the media was deliberately misleading the public by reporting otherwise. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the following: 

Summary: The idea is widespread and has been published in reliable news outlets, but professional historians seem to regard it as a myth, and it may even be the case that 'lawn jockeys' were not manufactured until after the relevant historical period (and therefore could not have been used for this purpose). 

ABA: About the American Bar Association In 1992 it was incorporated in Illinois as a not-for-profit corporation. There does not appear to be a body named "London Lawyers Guild" - a Google search for it only reveals (in the top 20 results) repeated statements of the claim cited in our question above. The original author may have been thinking of 

(source ibid.) It's also worth noting that there are no "corporate entities associated with individuals". The government does not create a corporation each time a baby is born. It's easy to check this by taking a look at the register of corporations in your state, or a company which amalgamates these records such as Hoovers. Here in the UK the resource would be Companies House. Simply search for a company with the same name as you - you're very unlikely to find one.
