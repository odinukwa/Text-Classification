Jump starting the agriculture is the first thing your “primitives” will be interested in. If they find one or more of the aforementioned children’ books on farming, they will get some interesting ideas how to advance their farming techniques. Finding pictures of modern plows drawn by a tractor will give them a massive head start. The plough was first used in Egypt around 5,000 BC (give or take). Having access to much better plows will greatly help farming, increasing yield and taking less time. While tractors will likely not be used by the primitives, they can use oxen to draw the plough. They will also find hints to modern irrigation techniques. Even better for them are the modern domesticated species. While around 5,000 BC the Neolithic Revolution already had happened, the much better “optimized” farm animals of our modern age will provide an immense multiplier to food yields be it milk, eggs, crops or meat. This requires of course, that seeds and animal herds have also been left for the primitives. Another very important domesticated plant is cotton, which would also come with a significant advancement in the timeline. 

EDIT 2: For the sake of this question "visible" means visible to the naked human eye and/or technology available in the late medieval period of our world (ca. 15th century). A solution using atmospheric conditions are perfectly fine as long as this does not infringe on the habitability of the planet and these conditions are the same from any point of the planet. EDIT 3: There are no restrictions on the perceived colour of the moon in the sky. It can be any colour, as long as it stays visible in the night and still give some light during the night. You can postulate any changes to our system that have no or marginal effects like described above and achieve the desired result. If this effect is not achievable with the restrictions declared above, please state why. 

While some of the answers have rightfully pointed out the difficulties of a Bronze Age civilization to use this “gift” properly to their advantage, I have a slightly more optimistic outlook and like to focus on the best possible course of action the civilization can take. Note that I will assume some additional information missing in your question. It will make a huge difference whether or not the Bronze Age people stumbling over the remnant of a modern city is a small clan living in a nearby village or one of the early civilizations with a large population and infrastructure of their own. 

Possible? Definitely. Adeptus mentioned The dragon with the girl tattoo, in which the protagonist, a female dragon, has a tattoo of a human girl; it is considered to be a mythical creature in that world. user3082 talked about another possibility as seen in Demon of undoing, where an alien takes the human race as some kind of role model. Whether humans exist or not in the universe we're working with, there can always be a plausible explanation as to why one would have a tattoo of a human. 

Scales First of all, let's clarify some points. Scales are extension of the epidermis, just above the dermis; depending on the kind of reptile, they can be very thin folds of the epidermis (e.g. snake scales), or thickened areas of epidermis (crocodile scales). You can find some good illustrations of these in the part 1 of this ZooPax. Normally (i.e. on humans), tattoos are injected in the dermal layer. This would mean sub-scale tattooing, which can be a problem for snake-like scales. However, if the scales are thick enough, we could get away with simply injecting the ink in the epidermis itself (so the scales) rather than in the dermis. However, things are not quite that simple. As Tim-B and user3082 mentioned, the biggest issue is that reptiles shed their skin (or moulting, if we go for the technical term) frequently. Each type of reptile moult differently; snakes do it by turning their skin inside out like a sock, most lizards moult in patches, though some do it all in one go. Crocodiles and turtles have a very different kind of scales; they shed them one at a time, but if we can simply tattoo them in the dermis directly, then it is not an issue. So, in either case, the solution would be to tattoo reptiles the same way we tattoo humans, by injecting the ink in the dermis; regardless of how we would do it for snake or lizard scales. Cort Amon mentioned a solution for that involving syringes and dye (though it can also be done with laser technology, it seems). However, even then, there is still another problem: it's a moot point to tattoo in the dermis if we can't see through the scales! Transparency Solutions can differ greatly whether the scales are transparent or not (or if they even can be), so I'll treat both of those possibilities. Opaque scales In that case, tattoos wouldn't be permanent because you would need them to be in the scales themselves rather than under them; you can think of them as an equivalent to our hair dyes. They would last several months (maybe even a year or more depending on the kind of reptile), but would eventually disappear as the skin is shed. However, Tim B suggested an interesting alternative in his answer, although even more temporary: 

As other answers pointed out, reading and understanding the manuals, school books and scientific monographs will be more or less impossible for your “primitives”. But there is one source of knowledge which will be understandable: Children’ picture books! And there are quite a lot of them purely focusing on explaining how the world works for children. Moreover, any pictures in books will grant additional help here to understand how this advanced world worked. Even better might be children history books and otherwise illustrated history books, which will provide much easier to follow “instructions” for the primitives. This will not allow the “primitives” to start up the steel factory, but it will allow them to understand the usefulness of many modern tools and techniques. They will also gain an idea of what is possible, if they finally understand how these things work. It is the difference between wanting to have something better, but not knowing what will be better and the clear knowledge of what is better, but not knowing how to produce this. This will significantly cut the trial and error period down. 

On earth there can be hours where the moon is up during the same time the sun is in the sky (daytime moon) due to the combined rotation of earth and orbit of the moon. I would like to have an earth-like planet which never has the moon and the sun visible in the sky at the same time from any point of the planets surface. Is this possible without too much interference with the earth-like state of the planet? Ideally the reason for the lack of simultaneous visibility does not effect the stabilising function of the moon for the planet's hability as well as has no significant effects on the planets seasons and day and night cycle. In general consider the planet, the moon and the whole solar system to be the same than ours. EDIT for clarification: Ideally the planet has a 

Your primitives would have easy access to lots of high grade tools. The most interesting here are those which are easily understood and used and do not need to be powered by electricity. Axes are already known, they will get excellent steel versions. Hammers are easily understandable. Saws will be a new tool, but easy to figure out. Again, children’ picture books come in handy. The problem with these is that they will degrade over time. It will depend on how much is stored in advance. Further interesting tools are shovels, pick axes, cooking ware, high end ceramics, steel needles of all variants, surgical tools … oh and foam filled rubber wheels (great for much better transportation). Replacing these tools will not be easy. But the people will have experienced a basic understanding of these advanced tools and will want to reproduce them. Most likely they will first use bronze, but they will look out for the metal, these tools were made from and work from there. 

(4) Microwave and radio cloak (4.1) Emission. Trivial to avoid. (4.2) Reflection. It is not that hard to prevent reflection of microwave and radio sources. The reason for this, its because their wavelengths are sizes we are costumed to (from meters to centimeters). By choosing the right geometry in your ship, to reduce RADAR cross section at maximum you can, you will avoid reflection. (4.3) Transmission. This is ideal, as we said. Thus we need to transmit the maximum we can. But it is somewhat hard to transmit radio signal, precisely because their wavelength is big. There are few ways of doing this. 

(2) Detection by EM Spectrum (2.1) Radio and microwave. RADAR is a system that actively scans regions of space, by emitting electromagnetic radiation mostly in microwave range, and hoping they will hit our ship and reflect back. Also, they might not emit any radiation at all, instead, they will listen for any emissions we do. If we try to contact someone using radio, we give away our position. Other radio sources that is emitting radiation might hit us, reflect from us, and enemy might listen. (2.2) Passive infrared detection. The enemy will try to look infrared signals. They are often released by black body radiation in normal temperatures. Basically, a thermal detectable signature because we have non-zero temperature. Also, other infrared sources might hit us, reflect and go to enemy, making us detectable. (2.3) Passive visible light detection. Looking.. maybe with naked eye. Or telescopes. Or whatever. We might be emitting visible light (lamps, engines, or whatever). Or, any other visible light sources (say.. sun, etc) might be emitting, hitting us, and reflecting back to enemy, which in turn it will detect. (2.4) Detection by radiation of higher energies. Cosmic radiation interacting with matter might emit photons, which can be detectable (to a ultra amazing high ridiculously accurate detector). Maybe we should ignore this situation. Or postpone to a future version. 

(6) Visible Light. (6.1) Emission. Trivial to avoid. Just shut down all the lamps in the outer-hull. (6.2) Reflection. We cannot reflect from other visible light emissions if we plan to be undetected (6.3) Absorption. Same argument for infrared. If we plan a good cloack, we cannot absorb visible light. (6.4) Transmission. Here we are. Its a must. And same argument of infrared applies to visible light. 

This is actually something that is done nowadays already for marking reptiles in the wildlife (Johnson, M. A. "A new method of temporarily marking lizards." Herpetological Review 36. 2005: 277–279). I could imagine this solution to be less restrictive than tattooing, notably with colours, as bright hues would be more easily achievable. Also, glitters. I don't think I need to say more. Transparent scales As Gertlx pointed out, reptile scales are made of keratin, meaning it is possible for scales to be transparent. However, this is still not enough. If the scales are too thick, the tattoo might be hard or even impossible to see through the scales. To sum it up, then, for a reptile to be tattooed in the strictest sense of the term (i.e. with ink injected in the dermis), and for the tattoo to actually be permanent, you need the reptile to: 

Extra reading content: Tattooing reptiles has actually been done before and is still in actuality. There is an article about the methods of marking small animals (Ngaio J. Beausoleil, David J. Mellor, Kevin J. Stafford. "Methods for marking New Zealand wildlife." 2004.); tattooing reptiles is described on page 82. 

For crocodile-like scales, the method would be the same as for humans, although the tattoo machine would need to be stronger to be able to poke through the reptile leather. If the tattoo is made manually (e.g. Tebori), this is less of an issue, as the force put in the tool is more easily controlled. For snake-like scales, it becomes much more complicated. Using the traditional method would probably get unsatisfactory results for reaching the dermis without damaging the scales too much. By using syringes or similar tools, one could inject the ink by going under the scales, but I believe this wouldn't allow a tattoo to be as elaborate as with the other method. If the intent is simply to tattoo on the scales however, then the tattoo gun would do the job just fine. And finally: 

Thanks to the points mentioned in other answers, I could direct a more extensive research, and this is the most satisfying result I got. Disclaimer: I went into much details because it seemed like there was a few misconceptions on how reptilian scales work. TL;DR: Unless the scales are transparent, the tattoo has to be done on the scales and as such, it is not going to be permanent at all because of the frequent shedding.
