The reason why the presumption of innocence should be observed is political and institutional. The government can extract virtually unlimited money from the population in taxes. The government has an enormous armed force called the police that it can use to hunt down and persecute people, as well as search a person's possessions without his consent. The government has a vast army of officials who can spend all day every day looking for ways to prosecute anyone they happen to want to target for any reason. The defense has some lawyers who can't use force except in self defense. Nor can they take stuff without a person's consent. The accused person will often be locked up until his trial so he can't participate much in his own defense. So the deck is stacked against the defense, and in recognition of that fact, the prosecution is supposed to give itself a handicap - the presumption of innocence. 

I am not aware of a work that takes a position against vegetarianism or animal rights, but I think the idea of animal rights is untenable. To explain why I will set the issue in a broader context than people usually consider. There are some things that have rights and others that don't. Human beings have rights, rocks don't. What explains the difference? The answer given by advocates of animal rights is that if something suffers then it should be granted rights. People then look at animals and see something that looks the way a person would look if he was suffering and say that it is suffering. Sometimes they go a bit further and talk about humans and animals having similar brain structures and say that the animal must be suffering since it has those structures in common with us. However, animals lack the ability to create new explanatory knowledge, unlike people. Dogs never learn to write, they don't learn English beyond some short list of commands, they can't write music or program computers. The reason is that a dog has a finite bag of tricks written into its genes and when it exhausts that bag of tricks it can't create anything new. Other animals are in the same position. For example, experiments in trying to teach apes language always reach a point where the ape can't do anything more sophisticated than what it already does. See "Kanzi: The Ape at the Brink of the Human Mind" by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh and Roger Lewin for an example. I think this is relevant in two ways. First, we have nothing to gain by granting animals rights. The animal has a particular set of knowledge (in the sense of useful or explanatory information) in its genes. So any copy of the relevant genes will have the same knowledge and no individual animal matters very much. By contrast, each person has a unique set of ideas and habits instantiated in his brain and that does matter. Every time a person dies unique ideas are destroyed that might lead to progress. Every time you mistreat a person you make it more difficult to get access to any good ideas he might have or that he might develop. So humans should have rights and animals shouldn't. Second, the idea that animals suffer is false. An animal can't understand what is happening to it and so can't interpret the pain as being bad. The idea that something is bad is a sophisticated interpretation of experiences that only arises in the light of a lot of knowledge. For example, one reason people suffer is that they can imagine all the stuff they won't be able to do as a result of injury or death, unlike animals. Animals are robots programmed to propagate genes. To do this, genes program their vehicles to move away from stuff that will damage the vehicle, refrain from using damaged body parts so they can heal, signal danger to relatives and other stuff like that. They bear more resemblance to characters in a computer game than to people. You might say that it looks like animals suffer, but that is an interpretation of what you see when you look at an injured animal. The explanation I have given criticises that interpretation. Likewise when you say an animal has a brain structure that is similar to some human brain structure you are imposing a false interpretation of what is going on. Both the human brain and the animal brain are universal computers: they can do anything that a universal Turing machine can do. It follows that you can't tell exactly what it is doing just by looking at the hardware. To the extent that some part of the animal's brain is similar to a person's brain it is participating in a very different process. The computation in the animal's brain doesn't involve understanding what is happening to it or anticipating problems as a result of an injury or anything like that: the animal doesn't suffer. People should eat animals if they like meat and they shouldn't feel guilty about it. For an extended discussion of issues related to animal rights see this email discussion: $URL$ 

You ask how an unguided process creates the information in biological organisms. You haven't asked a more pertinent question: how could a guided process create such information? If the process that created biological information was guided that process would already have information about what sort of biological structures would solve various problems. So an explanation involving such a process would not explain how the information was created and so it would be a failure by that standard. The only explanation that would be any good at all would be an explanation about how an unguided process gave rise to biological complexity. See "The Beginning of Infinity" by David Deutsch, especially chapter 4 (you should read chapter 1 before chapter 4 although it is not directly about this issue since it sets up other related issues). How does biological evolution give rise to such information? The explanation involves an information storage medium: a structure in which information can be stored and retrieved or copied. The medium in question must make copies of itself in a particular environment: a replicator. Any real copying process if going to have an error rate. So the copying process will produce slight variations in the replicator. Those variations may result in the variant being copied more than the original, less than the original or at the same rate. So biological evolution gives rise to variants of a particular replicator and then selects among those variants. Sometimes two instances of a replicator might get stuck together due to a copying error and then these longer variants would have more information storage capacity. But such longer variants may give rise to other problems, e.g. - for a given set of error correction mechanisms the error rate may be higher with longer replicators and at some point would the error would grow so high there would be no faithful copying if the length kept increasing. So longer replicators would have to evolve better error correction. You can ask questions about how such processes give rise to different biological phenomena, such as sex, ageing, and so on. Some interesting books on various aspects of evolution. "The Selfish Gene", "The Extended Phenotype", "The Blind Watchmaker", "The Ancestor's Tale" and "Climbing Mount Improbable" by Richard Dawkins. "Mendel's Demon" by Mark Ridley. "The Fabric of Reality" by David Deutsch, especially chapter 8.
