Response to first comment: 4000 million men, divided by 10 million men, is a 400:1 ratio. Note that military superiority is a given, for such a defeat, the means is not an issue in this question. With reference to human females, the ideal breeding age is about 15 to 30; 15 yrs in an average 75 yr lifespan, roughly 1/5 the females: Thus about 80 per conquering man. Many kings and emperors have had sex more often than daily, especially when young, a man could easily impregnate 80 women within a year, if desired. However, the actual global population rate is about 1.1%. Eliminating living males, that would be 2.2% of the conquered females. If there were 4 billion such, the birth rate should be 88M children per year. Given 10M men, they each would need to father about 9 children per year in order to sustain the current population growth. That is about one per six weeks, which is entirely feasible. (In the USA, the population growth rate is only 0.7% annually, so it depends on the culture to a large extent). As for a "fetishistic" focus on the subjugation of women, I find any such subjugation by gender or race repulsive, but I am also not in denial about the reality of the past of humanity, where such subjugation was common for nearly all cultures until the last few centuries, and often enshrined in law and religion. That was reality, and the further we get from it the better. Good riddance. This particular question asks about precisely that dynamic, the OP explicitly states his opinion that it happened, and asks if it did, what are the consequences? Do not forget the nature of this forum, I do not need to cite any historical references to give my opinion of the logical consequences of some posited fictional scenario! 

Bit by bit replacement. I am working under the presumption that consciousness and who I am have no supernatural component whatsoever, but are an emergent phenomenon of the processing done by my brain. That is my belief; there is no ineffable part to worry about. Neurons are biological and noisy. They fire spontaneously for no apparent reason; and can fail to fire when they usually would. It is nearly impossible to detect such errors in your own neurons. Usually these errors do not rise to conscious attention; if they do it is the common experience of a mental misfire, like "What is that thing you use, for eggs -- oh a spatula." If each neuron in my brain were, one by one, replaced with a machine that did exactly what the neuron did, within some tiny margin of error, like 1/1000th of a percent, it would be too small for me to notice. You could replace all of them. The biological me is gone, the digital me has taken over, and neither of them ever experienced either death or birth or any moment in which they were not the one being duplicated. The consciousness was indeed duplicated; the machined version may be far more maintainable, back-up-able, and have an effectively immortal existence (if destroyed, a backup stored offsite (including in a another star system or galaxy) could be used to restore it). Depending on how frequently changes to the machine are recorded (I am assuming it can form new connections and learn things), the interruption may be quite minor; kind of like how the impact of a car accident IRL can cause people to lose the contents of their short term memory that contained the time leading up to the accident: They often report not knowing at all what happened to them in the five minutes or so before the accident, the last thing they do remember was routine driving a few miles away from the accident, then waking up in the hospital. IRL that doesn't cause them to question their existence, and neither would being restored from a backup. As far as teleportation is concerned, the same philosophy could apply; there is one of you, disassembled and reassembled elsewhere. It is just another form of movement, philosophically speaking. 

Consider it like a PhD program, in science. I shall explain! (and I do hold a PhD in a scientific field, if you wonder if I know what I am talking about.) Given an average level of intellectual capacity, Bachelor's and Master's degrees can be earned by simple memorization and doing the assigned work. You do not have to invent anything, you just need to learn what is there. The PhD is different (if done honorably): You must make an original contribution to the field, which is obviously inventing something new and cannot just be an assignment or rehash of something others have done. It is also supposed to be the PhD Candidate's original idea, NOT his advisor's idea or an invention. So what, exactly, does the Advisor (the PhD guiding a Candidate to their own PhD) do in order to help somebody come up with their own original idea? The answer is, we must be guides. We need to help them explore, keep them focused on a particular aspect of technology that will hold their interest, and guide them in becoming educated enough to know where the edge of that topic lies: Meaning where the problems and shortcomings are. Then we need to help them separate what is plausibly solvable given a few years of full time work, versus what is probably intractable. Note that we don't know where this is going to end up, either. But the approach consistently works to help them find something original, that can be published in a "good" peer-reviewed journal (along with agreement by their committee, an essential element of proof of originality and a "contribution"). In most cases we want to see explorations result in multiple papers. Applying that as a metaphor to the learning of magic, you have a similar problem: The teachers do not know exactly, for any given student, what the hell they are going to do to get magic to work. So it is more like a novice going looking for treasure with an expert prospector; somebody that tells you, "You won't find anything there," or "This looks promising." Somebody that can watch you through a series of structured mental exercises to detect any hint of magic, even ones you may not recognize, and say "Okay, stop there. What were you thinking? What were you feeling? Because I'm watching the dust motes in the light, and some of them veered left." The students have to explore their own mental landscape; but clearly if there are mages, the very first of them must have found their magic on their own, perhaps by accident or luck. The job of the teachers is to increase the odds on accident and luck, not by magic, but by guiding their students through thousands of exercises and thought patterns they might never have experienced without such guidance. Further, even if they did, they may not have been paying attention to some minuscule magical effect, whereas the expert eye of the magician trainer spots the tiny clue and seizes upon it. 

Don't make your villains stupid and easy to defeat. They can be tricked by the unexpected; do not let them walk into losses that are wholly predictable, it makes the story a thoroughly boring wish fulfillment fantasy. 

I voted up with others and will agree; in an attempt to make the problem difficult, the setup has prevented most responses. A super-intelligence will out-predict all humans, or it isn't superior. If it considers us irrelevant but doesn't have a plan to defeat our nuclear weapons and doesn't comprehend we might use them, it is not very intelligent, is it? Once a super-intelligence has decided humans are irrelevant, it has presumably already contemplated all the things humans might do, or are capable of doing, and every way we might be a threat to it, or useful to it, and has decided it can counter any threat, and has no use for us, and further that we aren't worth the effort or resources required to exterminate us. We are like the birds on a property an investor contemplates buying: No need to kill them, they aren't a threat. The investor will destroy their trees and nests, they can't do anything about it. Whether the birds starve to death or fly away, the investor doesn't care; he is busy imagining his thriving new office building and giant parking lot. How does such a bird go about convincing a human investor to leave its tree and nest alone? The bird doesn't know English or reason and cannot even guess at the level of thinking going on in the human investor; the human doesn't care at all about the bird's emotions expressed in song and chirps. BTW, the AI does not need a language; it is entirely plausible to be conscious and rational without any internal language whatsoever. Human infants clearly are; they have to be in order to sort out all their senses and learn their first language. 

This actually relates to the OP's question; give me a minute. Self-awareness does not require an internal dialogue or a language in which to speak. Self-awareness is having a mental model (simulation) of one's own body and mind, which one can use in mental simulations to plan movements and actions for one's self, perhaps not perfectly but with more accuracy than inaccuracy. Self-awareness is the mental ability to treat yourself as an object or a tool in a mental simulation of the future, typically to reach some goal. In language terms, it is "If I do X, then B will happen, then I could do Y, and C would happen." But clearly such thoughts do not require words to execute, and in fact most thoughts do not require words. If I am trimming a tree, I can imagine balancing and bracing myself by holding onto a branch while I saw on its parent: and see in my mind's eye that at some point my balance and bracing will give way due to my own effort, and feel stupid for considering it, and choose to switch hands, saw with my non-dominant hand, and brace myself on the other side of the ladder on the part of the tree that won't fall. I may move the ladder to ensure the falling branch does not knock me off of it. All of that I can do without thinking a word; and it is self-awareness; not "instinct" about how best to remove a dying limb. In fact most processing we do is not easily conveyed in language at all; a dermatologist, for example, must learn thousands of skin conditions by sight, and there are often no good or definitive words to describe them. I am consciously typing right now, but there are no words in my head about how to type; no dialogue going on related to that action, like "now hit 'e'". An athlete is self-aware when consciously planning a physical action (like diving for a ball or to grab a bar or rope whilst flying through the air), but this is almost always thought of in pictures and mental rehearsal of actions without words. The internal language aspect most people consider crucial to self-awareness is not a necessity at all. It is generally something that follows in the wake of the non-language processing of other brain modules. It is not the command of them. Those other brain modules make use of models (simulators), that due to our language are also connected to words, so our language center is triggered as a consequence of these other simulators being present in a plan. The internal dialogue of "push it out of the way" is our language center's abstraction of a non-language simulated action plan that was formed without any language. This "In the Wake" process can actually serve to improve our processing; language is a high level abstraction, and as such a generalizer of the simulated action plan: This generalization can cause a double-check using other parts of the brain to examine other details of the simulated action plan: They can identify problems with it; in the wake of those firings the language center can generalize the problem, and cause a refinement cycle. Back to my tree-trimming: Language generalization of the action plan: "I can Hang on point A, saw through branch." Examining simulation: a visual, sawing through the branch causes it to fall; and everything beyond a point to fall, including point A, causing me to fall -- fear. Language: "And when I get through I'm going to fall twenty feet off this ladder, that is not good." New plan: given the visual of the branch falling after sawing, Point B does not fall. Solving the problem of bracing, I must switch hands. Language: "Hold there (B) and saw with your other hand." 

Then why aren't they in charge? What stops them from militarily just taking over from the Europeans and subjugating them? I infer they must be better at "strategy" than the Europeans, which makes them more intelligent than their masters, and better fighters to boot, since you intend them to be the reason the Euros dominate. Given all that, why isn't this a Griffin nation? Or alternatively, why don't the Griffin break away and form their own nation? Do the Europeans prohibit the Griffin from holding political positions within their culture? Are the Griffin considered second-class citizens? Is it okay for them to be guerrilla warriors or soldiers, but never okay to be Mayor or President? Can a Griffin be our modern equivalent of a billionaire, rich and powerful with many human servants and a huge estate? Or, despite their sentience, and capacity for self-sacrifice (volunteering to protect others), and superior reasoning ability (required for superior strategic foresight), are they still treated like horses, forever relegated to the animal kingdom because of their phenotype? Whatever makes the Griffin loyal to the Europeans, inequality and second-class status can be a powerful driver for them toward independence or a better lot. Perhaps that political reality is coming to a head: Let us posit that the Griffin, intelligent but warriors at heart, admire the Druids in war as fellow warriors. They note the Druids fight their own wars head on without fear; including their Kings and Priests on the front lines. This is something they don't see in any other culture, especially amongst their own soft and fat Euro masters that stay far from the action. A Potential Plot Path The Griffins are second-class citizens in the Euro culture. Put is in a time of initial skirmishes between the Euros and Druids, with Euros invading the more peaceful Druid territory. The Griffin population is unsettled; and developing an admiration for the Druid warriors; a stark departure from their experience with Euros and other cultures. In one of these skirmishes, a young Griffin doing his duty in the military, but also unsettled as to Griffin status in the Euro community, is badly injured by Druids; with broken wings and a spear through him, unconscious and left for dead on the battle field. The Druid King, walking the battle field in the aftermath in case any of his soldiers can be healed, finds this Griffin; and using his healing magic; brings him to consciousness. The broken Griffin awakes in horrible pain; the King lays hands on him and the pain vanishes to barely a throb. The King converses with the Griffin, half interrogation, and half questioning the motives of the Griffin. But this Griffin is not that sure himself about his own motives; he is loyal to a community that does not treat him as an equal. He speaks freely, certain he will die of his injuries anyway. In his mind a Griffin with broken wings is a dead Griffin, period. In the end, the King chooses to not kill the Griffin. Druids are nature lovers and love animals. The King knows the Griffin may return to war, but so might a horse, and he understands that the horse does not choose battle, it is enslaved and cannot do anything else. So the Druid do not slaughter injured horses left behind by the enemy. They heal them and set them free. He asks the Griffin if his kind has made the choice to invade Druidic land. Are they capable of their own decisions? The Griffin claims they are. The Druidic King ponders this, but then says, "You have given me no reason to believe that is true," and with a touch of his finger on the shattered wing of the Griffin, the Griffin falls unconscious. He wakes up hours later, the moon high in the midnight sky, fully healed. The spear through his lungs is gone; His wings intact and fully functioning, even the scratches and cuts of battle are gone. He leaps into the sky and climbs, then circles the battle field, there is no Druid or campfire in sight. He heads away, toward the European encampment. Thus begins the neutralization of the Griffins. This one returns, his story is told and kept amongst the Griffins. They believe him, the Griffin seldom lie to their own kind, and are never cowardly. The Druid King by touching the Griffin has learned the magic they need, and in war hereafter, a touch of more than a second or two from a Druid leaves a Griffin unconscious. After battles, any Griffin not killed in the battle, awakens healed. The Griffin allegiance to the Euros has softened, and they are not inclined to fight Druids. They are sentient, they know full well the Druids could behead them on the battle field, but the Druids choose to heal them instead. So while not all Griffins agree on everything, and some disdain the Druids for being weak and sentimental soldiers, the majority of Griffins have been neutralized by Druidic Mercy. And every time it happens, they question why they are following the orders of the European King at all. Are they really just smarter horses, blindly subservient? There is a growing sentiment among Griffins that "The Druid fight is not our fight, there are other lands to conquer." A separatist movement is brewing, and the Europeans know it; so they have that distraction of social inequality to keep them politically occupied. The Druids are smaller, geographically isolated, with no particular weapons or desire to conquer the world. The Europeans have a standoff with the Druids, and Druids alone, because both Crossbows and Griffins are of limited use against Druids, and an all out assault on Druids might lead to a Griffin revolution. They can still wage war and plunder other human tribes; so they do that instead, it is their path of least resistance.
