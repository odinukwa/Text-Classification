To have a noticeable effect the impactor needs to be BIG. Most questions about "what would happen if ... hits" can be answered by the "Earth impact effects program" ($URL$ Here are calculations for a 100km stony asteroid... A brute like this would have a good chance of wiping out most complex life on the planet. There has been nothing like this in the last 4 billion years (or so)... It could cause the length of the day to change by "up to 2.42 seconds" As gerrit said, it would be the last of our worries. 

It is negligible. The amount of energy per square metre per second is called the "flux". The flux of the brightest star in the sky, Sirius, is one ten billionth of the sun. That mean the energy the earth receives from the sun in one second is the same as the energy that it gets from Sirius in about 300 years. And Sirius (at magnitude -1.47) is by far the brightest star. All the others add next to nothing. 

When a satellite is in a circular orbit around a planet you may consider its motion in a rotating frame of reference; the frame rotates at the same rate as the satellite orbits. In this frame the satellite doesn't move. But because this is a rotating frame the formula $F=ma$ is doesn't work, you need to add extra terms for the centrifugal force and the corilis force. In the rotating frame there are two forces acting on the satellite: gravity and the centrifugal force, and since the satellite isn't moving (in this frame) these two forces must equal each other. If the satellite is modelled as a particle, all is well. But if the satellite is a rigid body the part of the satellite that is closer to the planet will experience more gravity than centrifugal force. The part of the satellite that is furthest from the planet will have the opposite: the centrifugal force will be greater than gravity. The result is that part of the satellite is pulled towards the planet, and part of the satellite is pushed away. This is called the "tidal force", as it is the primary reason for tides in the oceans. The satellite has its own gravity, and normally that is stronger than the tidal force. But if the satellite is sufficiently close to the planet, the tidal force may become greater than the self-gravitation of the satellite. The point at which this occurs is the Roche limit. The basic calculation of the Roche limit is based on finding when the tidal force (caused by the different gravitational and centrifugal forces over the satellite) exceeds the gravitational force. A more subtle calculation can take into account other factors: The tidal force can distort the satellite, the satellite may have significant rotation, there may be significant strength in the materials that form the satellite. These factors can cause a satellite to break up earlier or later than a simple calculation suggests. However, The "centrifugal forces acting on satellite centre and surface facing to the planet, caused by satellite's orbital movement?" are the tidal forces. So these are already accounted for in the simple calculation. The big uncertainty in calculating the break-up of a satellite is the strength of the chemical bonds that hold the satellite together. Most artificial satellites orbit will inside their Roche limit, but they don't break up because they are held together by strong metallic bonds. If a satellite is rigid, then it probably has some tensile strength and will hold together even if tidal forces are tending to break it apart. If a satellite is a "rubble pile" and doesn't have any significant strength, the assumption of it being "rigid" must be questioned. These factors introduce uncertainties that are much greater than any other forces, such as solar tides. 

A geyser is a water volcano, they are familiar and fairly common on Earth. By analogy, a water volcano on other planets can also be called a geyser, although the mechanism may be rather different. Geysers on Earth are caused by heating of sub-surface water by magma chambers. On Enceladus, there is no magma. The energy of the volcanos of Enceladus is carried purely by the water, and so they are sometimes called cryovolcanos They function in a similar way to volcanos on Earth, but with water instead of silicates, and at much lower temperatures. When a geyser on Earth erupts, the water all falls back to the ground or evaporates and is trapped by the atmosphere. Enceladus has much lower gravity and no significant atmosphere, so the water from geysers can escape into space, appearing as plumes of water vapour. A geyser is a water volcano. On Enceladus (but not Earth), the geysers are a form of cryovolcano. A plume appears when water from a geyser escapes into space 

In winter, the full moon is opposite the sun, and as the sun is low, the full moon is high. In summer the full moon is low (for the same reasons). The crescent moon is high in summer (and low in winter) but as the crescent moon is near the sun, it is normally not visible during the day. During spring and autumn, the sun, and the moon follow roughly equal paths, with no phase of the moon being higher in the sky. Third quarter, being at right angles to the sun will be at an intermediate altitude, in both summer and winter. For exact calculations either use technology, or a set of astronomical tables and a sharp pencil! 

Whether they are in a line is irrelevant. All masses have a gravitational effect. The gravitational effect of planets causes perturbation from an elliptical orbit. The gravitational pull of Jupiter (and to a lesser extent Saturn and the other planets) causes the Earth's orbit to change from nearly circular to slightly elliptical then back to circular. The planets also cause the angle that the elliptical orbit makes to rotate around the sun. Again this mostly caused by Jupiter. The eccentricity varies with roughly 100000 year period, and the angle varies over 112000 years. These effects are well understood and can be observed and measured. However alignments are inconsequential. Alignments of the planets have no effect on the Earth. They do not cause earthquakes. They do not cause volcanos. The moon does have significant effects, as it is the primary cause of tides. 

No. The precise details of collapse of a supernova are not perfectly understood, in the way we understand (for example) the orbits of the planets. However the energy comes from the release of gravitational potential energy. The "relaxation of spacetime" is not significant. We don't understand supernovae perfectly. But we have a good model of them. You should re-read Rob's answer to your previous question, not least because he got the order of magnitude of the energy release in a supernova correct. He also points out your error in thinking of the gravitational field changing "in an instant" Concerning the big bang. No, as has been often pointed out, the big bang was not a explosion. There is no analogy between a supernova and the big bang. 

The term can be traced back to the theoretical work of C.C.Lin in explaining the spirals as due to density waves in galactic discs. A paper from 1970 discusses the "Existence of 'Grand Design'". Note the use of "scare quotes", suggesting that the term was new and would not be widely recognised by his readers. Chia-Chiao Lin was an important Chinese/American Mathematician. It is reasonable to believe that the term was coined by him or one of the mathematicians that he worked with at MIT. And was in use since about 1964, when the first of a series of papers "On the structure of Spiral Galaxies" was published. 

Anaerobic life has much less impact on the atmosphere than aerobic life. Anaerobic life could exist in the deep sea and have no gas exchange with the atmosphere at all. Methane would get everyone excited. Biotic methane might be expected to have a different isotope mix compared with abiotic methane. But it is hard enough to distinguish isotope mixes when you have a rover on a planet. More complex compounds would be very exciting, but a very sensitive detector would be needed to find the very low concentrations required. It may be that the marker of abiotic life is the detection of anomalously low CO2 levels. Most abiotic atmospheres have very high levels of Carbon dioxide, but life will progressively reduce this level. A low level of carbon dioxide, in an atmosphere containing water, especially if coupled with methane would look bery interesting. 

Just because a planet is in the "Habitable zone" doesn't mean it is habitable. A planet is said to be in the habitable zone if it is possible for liquid water to exist on the surface. A planet may be in the habitable zone, and yet not be habitable if, for instance, it's atmospheric pressure is too low (like Mars) or too high (like Venus), both of which are in the habitable zone of the Sun. A star may be unsuitable for life for other reasons: it may be prone to extreme flares, for example. A blue giant is a star that burns bright and dies young, only lasting a few million years. Planets around such a star would have only just formed (they may still have molten surfaces). Blue giants tend to be unstable, being variable over a range of timescales, and ejecting large amounts of matter into space. So while there would be a region which is "habitable" in the sense that the surface temperature of a planet could be in the range 0-100, you wouldn't expect such a planet to actually be suitable for life. 

A horseshoe orbit requires a central body (eg a star) a large orbiting body (a planet) and a small co-orbiting body (an asteroid). If the asteroid has too much mass. The orbit "works" because the large body isn't affected by the small co-orbiting body much. You have a central body (a planet) and multiple mid-sized co-orbiting and 12 mutually interacting bodies (moons). This isn't stable. There are some special orbits like that of Janus and Epimetheus, which can be stable for a while. It may be possible to design orbits with more than two bodies in this form, but the region of stability would become very small, and subject to perturbation from the sun and other planets. 12 major co-orbiting bodies would not be a naturally occurring configuration. A sufficiently large planet could have 12 large moons, providing they are on sufficiently different orbits. 

Trajectories close to a black hole can't be approximated by Newtonian mechanics, General Relativity is needed. The black hole doesn't have a surface, but the Schwarzschild radius is point of no return. However it is not possible to orbit just above the Schwartzchild radius. If you are less than 1.5 radii from the event horizon, there are no orbits. The orbital velocity closer to a black hole than 1.5 radii would be greater than the speed of light. Inside this radius, the faster you try to go, the less the centrifugal force you experience becomes, and so the faster you would fall towards the blackhole. In fact you won't find a stable orbit closer than 3 radii from the black hole. If the black hole is spinning (as most younger ones are expected to do) the space around the black hole is dragged along by the spinning black hole. It is possible to gain energy by entering this region of dragged space around a black hole. This all means that a space ship can't remain in the region of ultra-intense gravity for many hours by orbiting, It can't experience (from the point of view of a distant observer) extended gravitation time dilation by orbiting a black hole only a few km above its Schwarzschild radius. It is possible to approach closer than 1.5 radii. An outside observer would see the spaceship approach the black-hole in a spiral at very high speed, but not cross the event horizon. The orbit would not appear to be elliptical and it would appear time dilated. Outside of 1.5 radii the dilation would be less. Trajectories close to the black hole would have to be calculated using GR. Newtonian mechanics would not be a close approximation. The calculation in GR would be computationally intensive, since the GR equations can't be integrated exactly, even for a two body problem, so a numerical technique would have to be used. Provided you stay rather further from the black hole, then the usual Newtonian approximation is valid. There's no certain boundary at which Newtonian mechanics is a good approximation. It depends on the accuracy needed. Remember also that the region close to a black hole is a violent region of space. It would be dangerous for a ship to be so close to a black hole due to the intense radiation produced by infalling matter, and tidal forces.
