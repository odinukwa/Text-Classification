I ride a hybrid cycle to/from work each day (10 km / 6 US miles each way). The handle bars are flat, and I ride with my thumbs gripped around the handle and 2 fingers close to or over the brakes (I feel safer). Last year I rode every weekday without problems, but this year I am getting some pain in my front shoulder muscle on my right side. I was doing 20 chinups and 50 pushups each day, so I cut these out for a while to see if it would help. I'm still cycling and still getting the pain. It hurts most when I sleep at night (I am a side sleeper) and when I wake up I feel the pain in a small area (front deltoid). I am wondering if other people had similar pain and any suggestions? Perhaps riding with my seat higher, or riding a racing bike would help, or even those little "verticle handles" that can be attached on very the end of my handle bars pointing upwards. Maybe my muscle development was assymetric with all the exercises that hit the front (cycling, pushups) without balancing exercises for the back? I'm 39, 6 foot / 86 kg and in otherwise very good physical shape. Thanks for any tips / advice PS. I'm a computer programmer by trade and use my right arm often during the day with the mouse. 

I am working to improve my segment times on Strava riding 10km to/from work. My average speed is 32 kmph, and over short segments (1km) I can set avg speed 44 kmph / max 49. Over the last year I have invested in a new bike and bike shoes, and now I leave a week's supply of clothes in advance in my work locker so that I can ride without a backpack - all of these improved my strava times. Now, I am wondering if my "standard" bike helmet is a source of wind resistance that can be improved. Is there a sort of bike helmet that is more aerodynamic? For example, a tempo helmet, or a helmet that doesn't have the "cooling" holes? What features and considerations should I look for when buying a helmet, given I am most interested in riding faster. Cheers Viking Steve. 

Up til now I have ridden with Strava running on my mobile phone sitting in a special mobile phone holder which sits up on my handlebars. Now I am looking for a better solution, both more aerodynamic for my new bike, and also with longer battery life (My present phone only lasts 2 hours with gps running). How do I select the lightest / best device that runs Strava? It obviously needs to be GPS capable. What features do I look for? Is it a smart phone? A smart watch? A garmin device? The device being light, comfortable, reliable and able to record rides of 4 hours or more would be ideal. Thanks for any suggestions. 

What sort of speed improvement can I expect going from a $1000 hybrid bike (Merida Crossway Striker) to a $2000 road bike (Cannondale CAAD 10 - 105), all other things being equal? Presently I can commute to work (9km) in 17-18 minutes. It's mostly flat on a dedicated cycle path. I am hoping to shave maybe 30 seconds off my time. Is this a reasonable expectation? 

For the context of this question, two people are trying to get from point A to point B (and back) where the only viable means of transportation is bicycle (and a tandem bicycle / electric bicycles are not available). The distance between the two points is 20km (40km round trip). Preparation time is limited, we could go visit point B next week, but it is unlikely we'll ever find ourselves in this part of the world again. The bicycles we do have available would be rented, mid-ranged commuter style bicycles. We'd both like to make this trip. One of us is a daily commuter (15km each way) who is used to longer rides of 40-50km on the weekends, the other rides rarely and has never gone more than 3km at a time. Even at a slow pace, 40km would be far more than this rider could do comfortably. What tips/techniques (if any) are there that would allow the stronger rider to complete the trip as comfortably as possible? Thanks 

However, when I apply my front brake, with maximum force - it doesn't seem to be nearly enough to send me over the handlebars or skid the tire. I slow down, but it seems to be fairly gradual. I've adjusted my brakes myself (possibly, I've done it incorrectly...) but there is very little clearance between my rims. My wheels both seem to have a very tiny wobble that prevents me from setting my brakes any tighter, but when I pull the brake it feels fairly soft, almost as if the cables have some stretch to them? My real question here is what can I do to improve my braking time? Does it sound like I've done something wrong. I did have the brake pads replaced once before, but they appear to be in good condition. 

My wife and I used this setup to make a long day trip more manageable for her. If your concern is just to get from A to B (and not improving as a rider), I think it might work quite well. I wouldn't recommend it for stop-and-go city traffic, but on country roads it seemed to work amazingly well for us. Using a spare inner tube (which you'll want anyway), secure a retractable dog leash to the frame/seat post of the stronger cyclist's bicycle. Extend the leash to a length of ~2 bicycles and tie it to the front of the weaker rider's bicycle. This let's the stronger rider, essentially, tow the weaker rider while still maintaining a comfortable (that is, comfortable for a novice) distance between the cyclists. I'm not sure how clear this will be, but here is an example setup. 

Is this a common thing, and if so, what is the motivation behind it? When I went to unlock my bicycle this morning, when I touched the U-Lock, it basically fell apart. It looks like someone used a hacksaw and cut through it. If it had been half-cut, I might think someone interrupted them (but even that is unlikely since you just need to say, 'I've lost my key!'). But in this case, it was completely cut. I had a cable around the tires as well, but it was all connected to the U-lock; so it was completely unsecured as soon as they cut the U-lock. This was in a parking garage with many bicycles. Do bicycle thieves 'prep' bicycles and then return later to steal them all at once? I was gone for two weeks, so I have no idea how long it has been cut. I'm mostly just scratching my head wondering why anyone would do all the work, and then leave the bicycle? 

I am building a bike. The headset is in the head tube, and the next thing is to fit the stem and handlebar to the steerer. At this point, it seems I need some headset spacers in between the headset and the stem. How many headset spacers am I likely to need? Or rather, how much total height of spacers? Is there any way to work this out other than trial and error? The frame has quite different geometry to my current frame, although my body's geometry is not changing. Should I try to reproduce the space on my current bike? Headset spacers are available in all sorts of combinations; would it be prudent to get something like a pack of five 10 mm spacers? Or a set of a 10 mm and two 5 mm? Am I likely to need more space than that? Less? 

I had the same conundrum when replacing a light a while ago. My solution was to buy a flashlight, rather than a dedicated bicycle light; it's about the same size and specification, but you get a lot more bang per buck. Bicycle lights seem to be rather overpriced compared to flashlights. The flashlight is a Fenix PD30, which costs Â£53.95. It can produce 257 lumens of light at its highest setting, which is masses - plenty for riding down an unlit country lane, in my experience - but will allegedly exhaust the battery in two and a half hours. I have never used it at that level for long enough to find out; i mostly use it for city riding, so i use the 10 lumen setting, where i go for months between battery changes. You can also buy lights based around similar Cree LEDs made by no-name brands in China for very little - my backup light is an UltraFire WF-501B body with an XR-E R2 LED, which allegedly produces 250 lumens and costs a hillarious $16.15. The housing seems perfectly good quality, it produces more light than the Fenix, but it does get quite hot when in use. I mount the light using a simple but very effective rubber and velcro Lockblock. It seems a bit dubious, but it actually holds the light far better than clippy things i've had on bike lights in the past. You can get cheap clones of this from China too. This light, like most current high-performance flashlights, takes CR123A rechargeable batteries, which are shorter and a bit fatter than AAs, but store more power. They are available in various chemistries; i use LiFePO4 ones, because although they don't store as much power as some other chemistries, they last longer, and don't explode when over-discharged. To be honest, it was the not exploding that really sold me on them. They are reasonably cheap - i use Tenergy ones, which are six quid for a pair. Based on the light you eventually bought, it seems you wanted more light than me, and were prepared to spend more. There are bigger, more powerful, and more expensive flashlights, made by Fenix and other brands, and by the fabulous workshops of the Orient. There is also the option of simply fitting multiple lights - i can carry two on my bars without difficulty. I think you'd be able to buy yourself as much light as you did for considerably less money this way. Plus, if you fit two lights, you can make your bike look like it's in Orbital.
