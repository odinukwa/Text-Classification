I have been progrmaming at my company for ~8 months now, and have been in a position unfit for the work I've been performing (Team Lead, in a callcenter). I was approached by the site director and the VP and offered a Data Analyst position, and they highlighted what they want to do and the project they want me to get started on. That was three weeks ago, I'm expected to work on the new project, and move forward with it. Yet I do not have the new position, the pay, the tools, or the access (Getting around the strict firewall) for the job I'm performing. I've brought it up a couple times with my "new" boss, and the question has been expertly dodged. It's not like this is a small company either, they have 1400 employees. How can I effectively, and professionally push back on this? 

How can I deal with this? It seems that my previous manager (John) made erroneous assumptions about what I do and instead of confronting me and learning, passed those assumptions onto my new boss. I currently can't even ask for more details on a request without being told I need to just focus on the current need, even if the information I am asking for is vital to determining how that request will be implemented. 

Edit: I am wearing business casual anyways, but was alarmed that I was told I was being insubordinate over my mention of comfort. TL;DR: Company encourages casual and comfortable wear, I get hot easily and wear (khaki) shorts to work. New boss wants her new team to dress business casual, for presentation reasons. I sit in a corner and develop all day in a call center, and my peers dress casually. I only make $31k/y doing this work, less than many of the floor supervisors who wear whatever makes them happy. My comment on my unwillingness was cited as insubordination. 

The time frame is 2 weeks. I have a year or so of experience designing single page apps utilizing AngularJS and REST APIs, but no experience with PHP or even with MySQL. Never mind having knowledge and experience of best practices related to the two. I have 3 years of C# & JavaScript experience. I'm being paid $31k/y right now, and am exempt from overtime. My manager is not familiar with software development, or the tools, workflows, or challenges associated with it. 

Edit at bottom for clarification as this seems be be misinterpreted. My boss wants to send me to a training seminar for a product a lot of our clients use. She mentions that this will also help me with my personal development and my career path. This product is something I will rarely if ever encounter again as I move more towards development. I feel that learning more about it is only going to detract from what I am already focused on learning and understanding. I have been doing software and web development for the past three years and am trying to quickly move away from my other duties (Data Analyst). I do not plan on staying with this company much longer at my current pay level and lack of career pathing towards my goals. My boss is very helpful thus far, and I do not want to scorn her by telling her that my goals for my career are much different than what she sees when she is actively trying to promote my career development. She is not familiar with software development in any way, and is very much a "people manager" not a technical one. What are some tactful ways to let her know that my career goals are different than what she is promoting without scorning her efforts? I don't want her to spend the time and effort getting budget approvals for a training seminar for me to leave the company a few weeks afterwards. I also don't want to sacrifice my mobility in the company by putting a spotlight on my willingness to stay with the company. Edit: I think this is being misinterpreted as I want to avoid doing work that my company needs me to do? This is not the case. I am doing whatever work they need or want me to do. However, as well as you, I have preferences what I would prefer to be doing. Preferring or wanting to do something different does not mean I am not doing what is needed. I am also being tasked with web development projects from a different team, so I'm not just going off and doing my own thing because I want to move to development. I am already doing it, at my employer's request. That being said, clarification: My boss, is putting in extra effort not just for me, but for each person on our team, to try and find ways to advance each of us in our careers. I appreciate this, as she is providing us with value past a paycheck every two weeks. However, in my case my goals and aspirations are different from what she has assumed they are. I am already doing development, going to a training seminar about something I am guaranteed not to use or encounter in development is counter productive for me. She has already put in effort for my benefit, I need to be tactful if I go to her and essentially tell her that her effort is for naught. That I appreciate her and what she is doing, but that I am actually interested in a different career path. Avoiding making her feel scorned. 

I work as a sole developer and data analyst for an outsourcing company with ~1500 employees, I used to work in one of their centers with 200 other employees and recently moved to a small executive office in a different city. I managed to find several people at the call center that shared similar interests as me, and have made several friends I still talk to and/or collaborate with. This is especially important to me because I'm very introverted, and the only places I tend to make friends are in the workplace. There are ~10 people in the executive office, the majority of them in a completely different place in life than me. There is little to no social interaction, or shared interests here, and it's depressing. There is a call center nearby that has ~150 employees, who nearly all live in the same city as me. They have a very active and friendly site-wide slack channel, so I reached out to the site director for an invite into the room. After explaining that I'm not there to play company politics, and just want to foster relationships outside of my official work capacity she wholeheartedly agreed to invite me. My boss saw the IM window from the site director and asked if she was reaching out for help, or if she was having issues. I explained that I was asking for an invite to the slack room, so that I had somewhere to foster relationships and network. She suddenly became serious and said the following phrases "", "", "". She was unhappy that I was going to interact with other at the company outside of my official role, though she did not forbid it. After I mentioned how this is actively encouraged within many part of the company and culture she said "while this may be encouraged for colleagues, it is not for us". I feel like this is unjust, I have no interactions in my current office, I have no local friends, and have no one to share similar interests with. Making friends in the workplace so I can meet up with them after work has been my own saving grace. I feel that I am expected to be nose-to-the-grindstone and not interact with others except when officially needed. It's giving me a lot of anxiety because even though I'm an introvert, I still feel a need to interact and foster relationships with other people. How can I approach her about this? Is it fine to do it anyways, even though she hinted that I should not? Are her thoughts on this reasonable?
