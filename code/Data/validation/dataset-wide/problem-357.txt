Well, first of all, not having the second World War is redundant. The second World War was caused by the way that the first World War ended. Some other ways the world could have been different 

The textbook University Physics by Sears, Zemansky, Young, and Freedman is going to be far superior to Isaac Newton's work. For one thing, it's designed as a textbook for people who are not familiar with the current state of the art knowledge. Newton was writing for other people like him, who already knew up through everything before him. So he really just needed to explain and justify his additions in that context. This textbook is designed to be read by people taking physics for the first time. It's a two volume book, so I take it that it would count as two of the three books for the question. However, it is incredibly comprehensive, including not just classical mechanics but also thermodynamics, electromagnetism, optics, and modern physics. Modern meaning relativity and quantum mechanics are both introduced. Another major advantage is that it is kept updated. Newton was simply wrong about some things. Preserving Newton would thus lead to people being partially wrong, which would not necessarily be made clear in the other books. That's one reason to choose general relativity over quantum mechanics. Obviously the ideal third book would be a general statement of what else was known about advanced physics so that people could rebuild quicker. So I might pick a layperson's book rather than a physicist's book. The problem is that physicists would tend to concentrate on one thing where you really want a more general survey. If you don't need a book per se, consider something like Pasco's Complete Physics Experiments. Because understanding the scientific method is at least as important as understanding physics. Most of what we know about physics was discovered in a few centuries. But it required the scientific method to start that. Another resource is practical physics. Or if you must have a book, consider How Experiments End by Peter Galison. That's a science history book that details three experiments. I haven't read it, but it looks like the kind of thing that you'd want. 

Iron ore. Other ore to mix with the iron to make alloys. Coal to burn and smelt the ore into metal or to shape the metal. Water/oil/whatever to quench the metal. Stone to sharpen the weapons or round off the armor. Leather and cloth to put under the armor, as metal chafes. Labor to do the smelting, shaping, quenching, and sharpening or rounding. 

A technocracy is obsessed with efficiency in government. The problem with this is that it will tend to stamp out wasteful behavior. Which is fine if the behavior really is wasteful but not if the behavior leads to advancement. So a technocracy has the same problems as any other centrally-planned society. Note that the problem isn't that the technocracy is less qualified than a democracy to run a government. It isn't. It is more qualified. The problem comes because the technocracy will almost inevitably try to control society more than it is capable of doing. They will think (correctly) that they are more qualified to make decisions If individuals make their own decisions, they will inevitably make conflicting decisions. This is bad in the short term, as it makes the decisions less effective. In the long term though, it means that an unpopular decision may still turn out to be successful. This is particularly true if the situation changes. Another way of saying this is that monoculture is dangerous. For this reason, a technocracy might grow more slowly than a democracy. The technocracy will save by focusing resources on the most likely areas. But the occasional solution will arise in the less likely areas in the democracy. It might well be less conflict-oriented. War is wasteful. Two technocratic governments may well be more likely to compromise. But that too is likely to lead to slower advancement. Necessity is the mother of invention after all. We didn't investigate nuclear fission and fusion to make electricity. We did so to make bombs to use in war. 

Direct funding to themselves. Spend more money than they contribute. Fund bad things. For example, neo-nazis make up .5% of the population in some countries. Perhaps the rules prevent concentration camps, but what else might they find to fund? 

Nicotine is addictive. Smokers who stop will either need to find another source of nicotine or go through withdrawal. Some symptoms of nicotine withdrawal: 

The issue with borrowing isn't that a nation can borrow money for basic financing but that it can use the money as bridge financing for slower economic times. In other words, the city is likely to have to cut back on its basic income payments at the exact time when they are most needed. A nation can borrow for a few years to keep payments flowing but a city often can't. If taxes are increased to pay for basic income, it provides an incentive to move somewhere else. This can be difficult at the national level. You have to move away from your job, find another country that will allow you to immigrate, move away from family and friends, etc. At the city level, this can follow an existing pattern: suburbanization. Because taxes are increased, jobs have to pay higher wages. This encourages employers to move out of the city. This won't work for everything. For example, government jobs can't move. But a large retailer might well move just outside city limits so as to take advantage of the lower wages. A manufacturer certainly. It's hard to move something like a port, but traffic can be diverted from one port to another. The impact on new business is important too. All this matters because a city can tax people who live there or work there but not those who move. A nation can tax citizens, even if they move outside the nation. A city can't tax people who both live and work elsewhere. In general, proposals that work at the city level either need a specific source of financing, e.g. sale of mineral rights, or national support. Safety Well, we could look at what has happened in existing areas where income has been supported, for example, housing projects. Are housing projects more or less safe? Anyone who's ever helped with distribution to the poor can tell you that many people resent charity. With basic income, they'll likely resent that it is not more. Obviously, that's the result of the greed of those who pay for the system. Immigration With a nation, it can be difficult to move into the nation. With a city, it's easier. In particular, cities almost always have suburbs next to them where people commute to and from the city for work. Interstate commutes are more difficult and less common. I would guess that this is even more true for countries, even those like Switzerland and Germany. Jobs usually don't exist right at the border between countries. They quite often exist close enough to the borders of cities since cities are smaller. Simply, it is more feasible to move to a city for basic income than it is for a country. Risk-taking Implemented at the city level, this will decrease many ways of taking risk. Note that if you move out of the city, you lose your basic income. So it's harder for someone on basic income to leave. It can increase other forms of risk-taking though. There's less reason to worry about giving up your job locally to do something else locally. There's also less reason to worry about something like gambling. In fact, it favors really big gambles. You may not want to take little gambles as taxes could reduce your winnings. But a truly huge gamble may be worth it. Particularly if you can move before the tax bill comes due so that you can get the lower taxes from outside the basic income zone. It also favors illegal gambling, as that can avoid the tax penalty altogether. Of course, illegal gambling would also make sense in a national system whereas moving before taking one's winnings probably would not. Inflation This can't cause general inflation, as a city can't print its own money. This can however move inflation. In particular, things on which the poor spend money may become more expensive. Class Warfare This is unlikely to have much impact on class warfare. The Haves will continue to look down on the Have Nots and the Have Nots will continue to resent the Haves. It may express itself differently on the part of the Have Nots, as they wonder why the Haves bother to work when they could just get basic income. 

Retirement Plans Obviously retirement vesting would have to change. The long-lived would have to work a good four hundred years before retiring for the system to have any chance of working. Since the long-lived would outlive many corporations and some governments, it is less likely that they will accept defined benefit plans and more likely that they will do their own saving. Young Adulthood You say that aging slows after puberty. For our purposes, consider young adulthood to end at twenty-five. So how long does it take to get to twenty-five in development? The same twenty-five years? Seventy-five is probably about right if it's proportionally longer after puberty. Anything in between can be justified. If young adulthood is longer, then something special will have to be done to handle things like voting and the drinking age. Otherwise, you'd have the equivalent of a fourteen-year old able to vote and generally make adult decisions. Can't drink until the equivalent of fifteen. It's also unclear how much of age is experience versus physical changes. Accidents Accidents will almost certainly stay the same on an annual basis after the initial adjustment (accidents are more common among the young and then drop around twenty-five). The much longer adulthood gives far more time to have accidents, so fewer would die of old age. Life Insurance Life insurance would be cheaper on an annual basis but more expensive on a lifetime basis. Not much if any cheaper during most of adulthood but distinctly cheaper during the senior years. Note that this is for term life insurance. Whole life insurance spreads costs out better, so it would be cheaper sooner. Healthcare Well, accident costs will increase. As will many diseases. It's unclear how it will affect healthcare otherwise. Will cancer rates, etc. stay the same? If so, healthcare would get more expensive as cancer's a cumulative probability. The longer you live, the higher your chance of getting cancer. Another possibility is that the chance of getting cancer over a lifetime will stay the same. So it will get cheaper on an annual basis while keeping a similar lifetime cost. I'm assuming that aging related diseases will stay proportionally the same. So Alzheimer's, etc. won't take effect until proportional ages. These will increase in absolute terms but take a similar portion of lifetime earnings. Intermarriage There would be many challenges in a marriage between the short and long-lived. That distinguished older gentleman that she married becomes the seemingly younger partner. She wants to retire, but he's still in his prime earning years (with a hundred year retirement for which to save). How long do their children live? Are they short, long, or medium-lived? If medium, we have a whole new problem as that makes the actuarial tables even more complicated. Do all five eighths long-lived people live similar spans? Or do some live close to short spans while others live close to long spans? Can they even have children? Note: it would be fine for the children to be either short or long-lived depending purely on random chance. How that might feel for the children could make for interesting subplots. Perhaps the eldest is seventy-five but looks twenty-five while the seventy-four year old sibling looks like a grandparent. How would long-lived parents of a short-lived child feel? One long-life can easily produce eight short generations, outliving four or five. Perhaps two long-lived parents always produce a long-lived child. Although if that's so, the long-lived population would tend to increase relative to the short-lived population. They can have more children for a smaller investment of their lifetime. Perhaps modern birth control would slow that. Abortion Would parents abort children who aren't long-lived? If it's genetic, it seems like it would be testable. This sounds like something controversial. Note that some nations ban abortions based on the sex of the fetus. Inheritance Our inheritance laws are pretty flexible if you leave a will. This may impact spousal relationships though. How will a short-lived family feel to see their memorabilia going to someone who is not a blood relative who may not pass them on for generations? Also, how will things like family businesses work? One long-lived partner may live through generations of short-lived partners. Inheritance laws that are pitched towards making sure that wives have something after their husbands die may change to add additional flexibility in the case of mixed marriages. Should a short-lived child who will be dead before the spouse is ready for retirement be able to get an inheritance now rather than never? How Long? How long has this been happening? People from the sixteenth century could still be alive. Resistance to Change The long-lived may be more resistant to change than others. The old are traditionally more conservative. The long-lived have more time to be set in their ways, and their ways may have developed centuries ago. Judicial Appointments Many judicial positions have lifetime terms. A long-lived judge might easily have been appointed hundreds of years ago. Perhaps they still remember slavery as a part of normal life. Perhaps the entire Supreme Court would be long-lived. Stable but very static. The Dred Scott justices could still be on the bench. Concentration of Wealth The long-lived may accumulate wealth over time. Since they rarely die, this may tend to concentrate wealth. For example, consider where we'd be if John D. Rockefeller was still alive. Also, the long-lived need to have more money, because they stay retired as long as five short-lived people. This might create pressure for wealth taxes in addition to income taxes. Income taxes keep the rich rich and the poor poor. Wealth taxes attack concentration of wealth directly. However, wealth taxes also work against saving, encouraging immediate consumption.
