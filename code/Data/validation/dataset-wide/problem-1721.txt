Can I configure DHCP split scope using our current Windows 2008 server with DHCP, and a new Windows 2012 server which I have installed DHCP on? 

However I have checked the SQL server and confirmed that mixed mode authentication is ON, there is no limit to concurrent connections, remote connections are allowed, and anyways MOST of the time the monitoring server is able to connect to SQL. If it was a network issue, I'd assume the error wouldn't be recorded in the event viewer on the SQL server. But I'm not sure what else it could be at this point. Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated! Thanks 

I never had this issue in the past, but I always had DPM2010 installed on Windows 2008 R2. Could this be a DCOM security feature with Windows 2012? 

A recent network scan revealed the following vulnerability: Apache Struts s:a / s:url Tag href Element XSS. Here is a link with more info about this vulnerability: $URL$ I would like to patch this vulnerability but everything I have read says that you need to update the struts package. However, in my case, this package is not installed. I have Redhat Enterprise Linux 5 with Apache 2.2.3. Is struts bundled in there? How can I patch this issue? 

The solution turned out to be just removing all routing group connectors which were still there from an Exchange 2003 server which was decommissioned years ago. The command I used: 

2nd Update I was able to figure out that the client used a different CSR than we sent them to request the certificate. I did this by comparing the "Issued To" info on their certificate to the same info on the CSR I sent them and found that the cities were different. Hope that helps someone else out there dealing with problematic clients :) 

Is it possible to set up a failover site to site VPN tunnel in Azure? I have one tunnel already established to local network "MyLocalNet". I want to set up a second tunnel with a different endpoint but the same local network. Is this possible? If so, can I configure some kind of traffic priority for one tunnel over the other? 

I inherited a network with a Fortigate 60B firewall. The VPN dial up client works right now as long as I specify a static IP. Problem is, it becomes hard to manage when I need to assign each and every person using the client their own personal IP. I already have a DHCP server on the internal network and so I figured I'd configure the firewall to relay the DHCP to dial up VPN clients. Unfortunately, that isn't working. I turned on debugging for DHCP relay and this is what I got: 

I joined a CentOS 7 system to a Windows domain by syncing the time with the DC and running . This allowed me to authenticate my login to the CentOS system using my Active Directory accounts. However, any AD account or group membership added after the initial join are not recognized by the CentOS system. I have to run and rejoin the domain in order for those accounts/settings to be recognized. How can I force CentOS to authenticate against the DC each time using the latest AD configuration? 

So I have no idea what else to try to get this thing logging aborted connections, whether it be the error log, general log, or whatever the heck log. Anyone able to help me out? 

There's some info about it here: $URL$ Basically it sends ARP requests through your network and builds a MAC/IP table based on that. 

I've tried with the default settings too and it makes no difference. Here is a sampling of the errors from the MariaDB log: 

I have an SQL 2008 R2 server and a monitoring server both on the same physical network (but different VLANs). The monitoring server is always connecting to the SQL server to run a query and check the output. However, the monitoring server is intermittently failing to connect to the SQL server multiple times a day. I tested while the issue is occurring by trying to connect from SQL Management Studio on the monitoring server and I get this error: 

I'm trying to RDP to a client's server. When trying from Windows 2008 R2, I get the following error after being prompted for my credentials: 

Found a KB at $URL$ for anyone running into the same problem where they receive error # 80040154 when configuring Exchange 2010 CAS 

I have an Azure VM with CentOS 7.1, Apache 2.4.6, and MariaDB 5.5. The VM has 2 cores and 3.5 GB RAM. The server is only hosting a small WordPress site with almost no traffic. For the past two days, MariaDB constantly crashes with an OOM error. I've tried so many different things for tweaking performance and so far absolutely nothing has helped. This is the current config from the file: 

I'm sorry if this isn't the right forum for this question but I read the rules and it didn't seem to imply I can't ask this... Anyways I'm looking to get some EC2 dedicated instances because I will be hosting a HIPAA compliant site and as I understand, you are required by Amazon to get dedicated instances for this. I read that there is a dedicated per region fee of $2 per hour, regardless of how many instances you run in that region ($URL$ Does this mean that it costs a base of ~$17,520 per year to have one dedicated instance? $2 per hour x 8760 hours per year = $17,520 

We have Exchange 2010 deployed with Outlook Anywhere. People connect with Outlook to the external hostname (mail.example.com) through RCP/HTTP. It works fine for people outside of the office but when people are inside the office, the Outlook client connects to the NETBIOS name of the server (ex.example.com) and this generates an SSL cert warning since we do not have a cert for the NETBIOS name. How do I resolve this? I assume I need to install a cert for this server which will be trusted by our Windows domain, but I don't know how to do this. Thanks 

I am currently hosting multiple production projects in Microsoft Azure. Each project is configured with a separate virtual network with two Windows VMs to act as web servers, and one server to act as domain controller. Security is essential in all environment so I have kept them totally isolated from one another. I am going to create one additional virtual network which will serve as a management area, and I will connect this network to each other one with a site-to-site VPN tunnel. My goal is to use this management network as a base for centralized WSUS management, endpoint security management, GPO configuration, etc. Would it be smart/secure to design it like this? I was thinking of having one Active Directory forest with the TLD in the management network, and each project network as a subdomain in the same forest. Any suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated as I attempt to plan out the best configuration. Keep in mind, it's not a problem for me to reconfigure the current project networks to fit into this new model. 

We have two Windows 2008 domain controllers. We installed the second DC only a few months ago. We also have a TFS 2012 server on the network. Today, when the older DC crashed, TFS stopped working completely. Local users received messages such as "You are not authorized to access ServerName\Collection". Remote users received messages such as "The server was used in your last session, but it might be offline or unreachable". So my question is, why did TFS not use the second, newer DC instead of just crashing along with the first DC? 

I tried to reset the session, resetting the user's password, running from a command prompt running under his credentials. Nothing worked. Any ideas?
