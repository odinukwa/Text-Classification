In a sense, computers are already capable of a degree of creativity. However it has always been humans who have been urging the computers to become creative - it has not been the computer that has engaged in the act of creativity for its own explorative or expressive requirements. Creativity in computers has normally been based upon one or more elements of randomness - alternatively conformity to seed algorithms. In most cases creativity has been confined to the strictures of the rules coded into it by its programmers (and in the few other cases there are external forces at play - forces beyond the control of the computer (example - a gust of wind causing sprayed paint to divert towards one direction). Existing forms of limited creativity include fractal graphics (graphical output on the basis of mathematical algorithms) - I am also certain that a computer's decision-making abilities allow it to perform a limited evaluation-driven pseudo creativity - such as when a computer projects suggestions to reduce drag over a surface area (based on the design inputted and the rules of aerodynamics for instance) or when a computer chooses its next chess move (particularly when its outside the library of opening moves (with their pre-defined values) and when it isn't caught up in a 'recognized endgame sequence scenario'). 

Furthermore one can also consider the natural structure of allegiance in terms of the social and familial bonds that tie individuals' interests to each other. This is the force of sympathy where acts of benefaction towards a select few others serves to satisfy the self (in a round-about way) It is in light of the natural force of sympathy and humanity's gravitation towards the familiar that requires that I suggest option 1 in the question (Everybody makes sure they are happy) to be the better approach - requiring less ethical gymnastics on the part of the individual practicing it. However it is also true that once an individual is 'happy enough' that they may choose to allow some excess happiness to spill over upon those around them - fanning outwards through and beyond their familiar connections. 

Even with the limitation of computers to abide within the strictures of the code set to them it is more than conceivable that as these strictures become ever more complex and nuanced, so too will the computer be able to expand its methods of 'thought'. These may become more and more life-like or we might be surprised to see that computers settle into a form of creativity that is unlike that of humans but undoubtedly creativity nonetheless. Perhaps we will one day master the art of simulating in code the delicate processes of human learning, memory storage, interpretation, emotions, drives and ambitions, extrapolation, sympathy and desire, and more. For a little (movie) inspiration I would suggest taking a look at (by no means a complete list), in no particular order: Short Circuit (rather old), Bicentennial Man, The Matrix, iRobot, & Wall-E (animated) 

When the pursuit is that of knowledge then a well designed question certainly lends itself to its answering in an effective manner. Even if no answer is forthcoming a well formulated question should at least help serve to guide the self in seeking out directions of exploration to help come to such an answer. A person who chooses to question also opens him or herself up to possible answers and those who seek are more inclined to find - even if such be through stumbling upon such answer through observation or happenstance. When the pursuit is that of piquing the minds of others (or projecting a view in an indirect fashion) a well formulated question will better serve to impress the underlying views concerned. I discount the generally interrogative "Is it not so that...?" since I feel that the standoffish/ pressuring nature of such questions may fall outside the scope of your intentions with this question. Instead I speak more of the questions that gently draw the potential respondent to consider elements in the world around them that they generally would not. For instance - "Why do you suppose that we tend to seek out the answers or advice of authorities when we have questions?" (Not seeking an answer - its a simplistic example) 

Preamble: The passage of life is a social one where humans are immersed in experiences from the day they are born until the day they die. Individuals at any point in time may be said to be not only the sum of their internalized experiences but also of the interpretations of those experiences the thoughts and ideas that arose from them. This is why different persons can act in completely different ways within the same circumstances, each potentially believing that they are acting ethically (not everybody places the same weight on ethics as a factor in decision making). We begin in a most malleable form - and we are most open to ideas and change - for we are students of the world. As we grow we become more rooted and we become more defined - some of us call this consistency. The value of consistency is that the individual who practices it also seeks to practice his or her morale standpoint with consistency. The drawback is that any imperfections in a morale standpoint may grow more rigid as time goes by. We as a species are still evolving and surely further answers shall come to the fore to fine-tune our understanding of the ethical. 

If a population were to face a situation of certain demise then there would be little scope in tightening a government's hand upon the rights of its citizenry. Yet even in the face of such circumstances it would be the responsibility of each person, as well as the government, to retain a semblance of the civility enjoyed up until that point. A glance at past scenarios of wartime and disaster period chaos will reveal a great surge in incidences of looting, rape and murder. As the state loses control over order there will be those who will seek to capitalize in vain self-interest. However there is a wide divide between serving to protect the rights of the people and seeking to limit them for the purpose of retaining control over the populace. It may be argued that even in a situation of (relatively) non-apocalyptic events such as war, disasters, terrorist threats, and the like, that the limiting of citizens rights serves to subdue the populace and reduce morale (an essential element in facing up to the challenges represented by these circumstances). Even the expropriation of property - and therefore the limiting of a person's right to enjoy his or her property - is a dodgy move, ethically speaking. It is a sub-ideal choice made in a dire circumstance. However - it cannot be denied that certain choices having a negative impact upon the rights of individuals may be necessary or at least desirable in gaining advantage in dealing with the crisis (example - expropriation of land for the building of air defenses - or the claiming of crops for rationing purposes) - or the indefinite detaining of persons suspected of intending terrorist acts in detention centers. The truth that no matter how necessary such measures 'might' be - they represent an erosion in the values practiced by the said government. In conclusion, if the values of the nation are to be valued then there should exist effective checks and balances that prevent a government from limiting the rights of citizens during crisis situations (beyond normal limitations). 

The nature of the consequence and the nature of the challenge set determines whether the fear of failure instilled is ethical or not. The following is an attempt to apply the above. I am not completely happy and welcome suggestions for improvement. Examples: A) Win or Die 

To return to your question: The pursuit of consistency need not only be one for those who have become so comfortable with their ethos that they would close their minds to new information. The pursuit of consistency can be the seeking of a morale system that not only works well in one's dealings with self and others, but it can also work well in one's evaluations of others' actions with respect to the self and others. The pursuit of consistency should extend to scaleablity - and seek to address the appropriate treatment of those of radically different perspectives on the matter, as well as those who have acted in breach. Is one's reactive action upon those of such actions righteous and is the nature of the reactive action worthy of the principles that are sought to be upheld (or is one merely exercising power)? On a different level, the pursuit of being true to the self is also a desireable trait. Does society need to be so removed from the individual that it should take on an identity altoghether unhuman? Is nature such an unruly teacher that we should ignore the practice of millenia? Nature may seem a beastly place where species make meals of each other. And yet most species can either be tamed when provided the appropriate environment within whch to thrive, or even display seemingly unexplainable acts of affection (including to those not of their kind). What nature teaches us is that we need to practice a healthy degree of self-interest - a morale standpoint that spirals from the self and outwards through family, friends, colleagues, teams, society and beyond. The closer to self, the greater the personal interest at hand. Which would seem to justify selfish acts at the expense of others - but again it need not be so. Again through the practice of self-interest it is in the interest of the self and those close to the self for one to benefit from the fruits of others. A barren tree bears few or poor fruits while it is the prosperous tree that bears a rich harvest. Those with understanding of this principle, with self-interest at heart will seek to invest in the sowing of prosperity in those around him or her - thus investing towards a buffer of prosperity in an otherwise barren world (presuming a worst case scenario where few act with self-interest). Others who act similarly are the selflessly charitable. These sacrifice from the self to better the lot of others. While the principle is admirable - they can do so at the expense of themselves and more-so - their legacy. their own prosperity may become compromised and worse - only a portion of their charity tends to get to where it is intended to get (presuming that the charitable do not practice their kindness close to home as a person with self-interest at heart might. If a person is unwilling to guard the heart then the heart is vulnerable to suffering - and life will test that heart's ability to endure. Betrayal, deceit, ignorance - a spiralling descent into an abyss of one's own design. No ethical system is immune to being tested - but some standpoints are more liable to it than others. 

A work performance bonus is nice - its not a right but its certainly welcome. Making it competitive such that the second best is left with nothing regardless of how stellar his or her performance is rather mean however. 

Of course an alternative interpretation more in line with traditional religious thoughts would be that these are tribulations and tests to serve the trial-by-fire of the individuals themselves and/ or the ones who care about them - and/ or even the perpetrators of evil acts. 

To (loosely) abbreviate the above: "To live a life of ethical correctness is to live with greatest respect to self as well as for others - with greatest consistency and in line with the beat of nature." Not quite a formula - and I am not certain that such a thing could be translated into a formula - but the variables at play here would be: Consistency, Proximity to Self, Proximity to one's nature, and Prosperity. 

Furthermore if we were to think of the world that 'everybody' lives in as being itself a pool of finite resources from which each individual's benefit is sourced, then the picture grows less clear. Yes in a perfect world with plenty of resources it is feasible for each person to be completely selfish or selfless since the drive of competition for resources is low. However in a scenario of middling-to-mediocre resources where few individuals achieve their dreams and many live lives of quiet desperation as the sands of time slip away - that is when the individual interest needs to be safeguarded while opening the self up to the concept of synergy in terms of the fashion in which resources are utilized. 

Populism also lends its name to the practice of formulating policies and political (and other) maneuvers around the nurturing and harvesting of support among the most populous sections of a given population. This may be exercised in a democratic country. "Vote-bank politics" involves populist maneuvers to gain the favor of a given sizable portion of the population to assure election over an entire population. As such - populism can be exercised as a means to gaining or retaining power over minorities through gaining the favor of majority stakeholders. This may lead to 'Tyranny by majority' - a situation where the wishes of the many outweigh the wishes and needs of the minority. One last comment on the matter is that while a system of governance or rule may be popular - it may not necessarily be right - and can often fall a long way short of perfection. A lot more could be said on the subject - but would fall outside the scope of your question. 

Since the fear of failure is the fear of losing one's life - and arguable one could posit that one has the right to live, the ethics of setting up the challenge is questionable at best. B) Job Bonus 

I realize that this is not the kind of answer that you might have been expecting and I also realize that it is not the sort of answer that many would agree with. It is included for consideration. 

Of course - pointing towards an omnipotent God for reasons why the mad gunman wasn't stopped from going upon his rampage is perhaps to shrug off the role that any individual might have had in seeing to it that such circumstances are prevented or eradicated in the name of good. Perhaps each disaster should be viewed as the tragic peak of an iceberg of incompetence and callousness. Perhaps humanity should play more of a hand in our own destiny. 

That the cycles of a physical universe might occur devoid of the presence or possibility of sentience would seem pointless to those who might ponder its theoretical existence, but such a circumstance would represent a reality to which meaning has not been applied. Also by who's yardstick should we define this meaning, and why would such lack in application of meaning necessitate that the reality concerned may as well not exist? It may not be of concern to 'us' but what if the playing out of this physical universe were simply validated by sake of its being? In the absence of a sentience to appreciate reality, reality itself would be without meaning but would still retain all the qualities that would appeal to sentience were it to exist. 

In terms of philosophical frameworks... I am thinking that Eternalism may be worth looking into whereby certain interpretations might consider even elements such as free will to be deterministic. A universe where sentience is predictable but just a lot more difficult to fathom than the erosion of rocks or the death of stars... and where lives (and perhaps souls) are but material energies existing upon different levels, ever converting. 

Technology has advanced greatly and the rate of innovation has been accelerating (although I would say that this rate is approaching a plateau). It has certainly advanced to a degree that it is steadily replacing the human element at the work place. As humans become redundant in an increasing number of tasks so too will society be increasingly at pressure to adjust to current circumstances. Work continues to flow. Jobs are created. Economies expand. Where these fail - austerity measures and unemployment take hold. Humans are addicted to work because it is what most are raised to believe - Work hard so that you can work better and become materially gifted (a paraphrase, admittedly). But as technology continues to advance, work shall become increasingly a sentimental process - an act of perpetuation because the purpose of life has been so closely tied to work. A humanity ill-adjusted for a non-work-based life purpose would suffer in the same way that a large portion of people suffer post-pension stresses as their health, physical, emotional and mental, declines. Work is virtual in two circumstances. It is virtual when it is a process not directly related to the task at hand (for example - cleaning or maintaining one's tools between uses). It is also virtual when it is non-essential to the needs of society or self (anything from parking attendants to and beyond marketing managerial positions). What if technology were to reach levels whereby it could completely take on essential work processes, leaving only some virtual work processes for humans to handle. It would be possible for humans to continue performing the tasks overtaken but perhaps humanity would be set to adjust to the new reality and embrace the consequences.
