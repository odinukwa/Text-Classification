[ Dirks goes into some details about where and under what circumstances Auckama would have been killed, and which evidence remains. ] 

[ After this introduction, Dirks gives some background of the event. In the last quarter of the fifteenth century, Friesland was in a conflict between two fractions, known as the Vetkopers and the Schieringers. The city of Leeuwarden was usually at the side of the Vetkopers. On 20 April 1482, the cities of Leeuwarden (Vetkopers), Bolsward (Vetkopers), Sneek (Schieringers) and Sloten (Schieringens) signed a treaty for a period of four years, in which the citizens and inhabitants of these cities where allows to buy, sell and travel between each other, "fry ende feylich" (freely and savely). However, after this treaty expired in 1486, new prohibitions where created in Leeuwarden, amongst which the rule that beer from Haarlem (known as Kuitbier) was not to be sold, but only beers brewed in Leeuwarden. Dirk notes that this rule was at that time of much more importance than such a prohibition would be in our "coffee, tea and jenever-drinking time". In 1487, and even long after that, beer was the popular drink, and was brewed and imported in very large quantities. As such, beer brewing was the livelyhood of many people, and the brewers guild in Leeuwarden was politically very powerful. On the other hand, the beers from Haarlem where of higher quality, because the dunes in that region make the water used for brewing more pure. So this prohibition was controversial at least.] 

$URL$ That translates roughly as: "Most serene Emperor Charles, by God crowned Great Peaceful Emperor, ruling the Roman Empire, and by the Grace of God King of the Franks and the Lombards". So Charlemagne claimed to be the Roman Emperor, and the most important part of the ideology about Roman Emperors is that they Were the rightful rulers of EVERYWHERE and EVERYONE. So how could a tiny little realm like Andorra, right at the edge of a mighty state - or even surrounded by the territories of that state - whose aggressive and expansive ruler claimed to be the rightful ruler of EVERYWHERE and EVERYONE get acknowledged as an independent realm by that mighty state and its ruler? That seems like an impossible event. Recognition of the independence of Andorra would seem to be impossible until such time as nether of its neighbors in Spain and France was the Emperor and thus compelled to claim lordship everywhere he could. In 988, the Count of Urgel, a semi-independent ruler in Catalonia, gave Andorra to the Bishops of Urgel in Catalonia, who later became subjects and vassals of the Crown of Aragon. In 1095 the Bishop of Urgel and the Lord of Caboet in Catalonia signed a treaty making them co-rulers of Andorra. In 1278 a conflict between the Bishop of Urgel (by then a vassal of the King of Aragon) and the Count of Foix (by then a vassal of the King of France), the heir to the Lord of Caboet, was settled and they continued to share the lordship over Andorra. The heirship of the Lord of Caboet descended from the Count of Foix to the Kings of Navarre. Henry of Bourbon became King Henri III of Navarre in 1572 and King Henri IV of France in 1589. In 1607 he issued an edict making the head of the French state co-prince of Navarre along with the Bishop of Urgel, thus transferring the overlordship of Andorra from his Kingdom of Navarre to his Kingdom of France. I suppose that after 1607 all the rulers of France considered Andorra to be another country that they were the (Co) sovereigns of and thus felt they didn't need to make Andorra part of France to have some authority over it. To make an already long story short, I suspect that the exact answer to when Andorra became recognized as an independent state would be found in the diplomatic files of various European states, most importantly its neighbors France and Spain. 

Lars Brownworth discusses the survival of the Eastern Empire and by tangent the fall of the West in "Twelve Byzantine Rulers" in Episode 5: Zeno. His book by the same name presumably discusses the same. The podcast discusses the general situation at the time of the various emperors essentially being puppets of barbarian generals and the like. The fall of the West wasn't some immediate thing. The last emperor was deposed but it wasn't until later when no new Emperor was crowned that the empire "fell". It was more that was the end of direct Roman control over the remains of the Western Empire. The Eastern Empire avoided this fate by the work of Zeno who managed to throw off the barbarian yoke in the east and forged a solid state that proved durable enough to survive as a united thing. Odoacer and later Theodoric both payed homage to the Emperors in the east but after Theodoric died, the later kings and chiefs in Italy didn't mint imperial coins or do otherwise to show any kind of fealty to Constantinople. This eventually prompted Justinian to invade Italy. 

Neither Polybius or Livy, the 2 main accounts, mention how many elephants, if any, died during the crossing of the Alps. Appian's account says that Hannibal took 37 but also does not number those lost, if any, crossing the alps. Hannibal certainly had a number of elephants at the Battle of Trebbia, though all but 1 or 7 supposedly died in the cold weather afterwards. Though elephants do not climb up mountains unnecessarily, they do so when it is part of their migration routes. Elephants can handle colder weather than they are used to, due to their great internal heat. Elephants are also very surefooted. So it is perfectly possible that there never was even a single elephant bone or skeleton from Hannibal's army in the Alps to be discovered. 

I came across this question today, and saw that JMVanPelt in his answer mentioned a Dutch book for which no English translation was available. I have translated the relevant parts of it below. I have tried to stay as close as possible to the original phrasing. Below, all emphasis is as in the original, comments between round brackets are also in the original, and comments between square brakets are mine. It should be said that I am by no means an expert on history or historic use of the Dutch language, so the translation below might contain a few translation errors caused by a change in the meaning of words or phrases since 1867. Also, I'm not native in English, so I apologize in advance for any lingistic errors. 

Finland to an extent played both sides. This article pretty well covers things. The combination of difficult terrain and well trained, well equipped soldiers helped the Finns ensure their independence. They did lose a fair chunk of territory to the Soviets but succeeded in staying masters of their own affairs and allegiances. 

By the cast listing on IMDB, it's Charles VIII which makes sense as he started the Italian Wars. He was the last king of France to be a full Valois. The actor who plays him is a good 20 years older than Charles VIII would have been at the time. 

It is logical to assume that every crusader wore clothing made of various types of cloth, or leather, or skins, or wood (for shoes?), or reeds, etc., etc. but only some crusaders had any type of armor. Thus it is logical to assume that every crusader wearing armor wore it over some type of clothing to prevent chaffing and pinching his skin, even if he was a really tough guy. And maybe that underclothing kept the armor from transferring too much heat to the Crusader's body. And it seems logical to assume that many crusaders also wore some clothing over their armor to shade it and keep it from adsorbing heat from the sun. In fact books on heraldry often state that the surcoat was adopted during the crusades for that reason, and that the mantling over the helmet was also introduced during the Crusades to keep the helmet cooler. Wikipedia says about the knight's surcoat: 

[ Dirks explains that there was a rumour that Pieter Cammingha had been fortrifying his estate and loading it with provisions and ammunitions, and that this young Schieringer lord was preparing to attack the mostly Vetkoper city of Leeuwarden from within, as soon as other Schieringer forces would attack the city from outside. However, a group of Jacobian monks from a nearby monastry, amongst which a monk known as Brother Hendrik, came to the site and were let inside to house, and later testimony of Brother Hendrik shows that the Cammingha house was most certainly not prepared for siege. Pieter Cammingha asks Brother Hendrik after his mother Doede, who stayed at the monastry, and he sends the brother to ask for this mothers advice. His mother adviced Pieter not to fight, but to make a deal with the mob. ] 

France and various Habsburg lands including Austria were political and diplomatic enemies and often at war during almost 300 years from about 1477 to about 1750, and again for most of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. During that period French became the most prestigious living language in western Europe and was a second language to most members of the social elites. But Austria seems like the realm whose government had the least motive to decree any sort of special favorable legal status for the French language. So I doubt that anyone will find much evidence of a special legal (as opposed to social) status for French in Austria, however Austria is defined. 

Something that has long puzzled me is the use of full mail hauberks and the like in the Crusades. How did Crusaders and their various enemies avoid cooking inside their armor? I know many of them did die of exposure and the like but they did still fight and take territory. I'd assume the Byzantines and other local powers who used Cataphracts and similarly "covered" troops, ran into similar problems. Was it just a man it up and take it kind of a thing or did they fight at less hot times of the day? Change the campaign season? 

He still had to list all the other fiefdoms because they were outside of either the Kingdom of Sicily or the Kingdom of Sardinia and his right to rule in those fiefdoms was totally separate from his right to rule in either kingdom. If Victor Amadeaus had tried to annex all his lands to the Kingdom of Sardinia he would have been committing treason against the kings of Italy and Burgundy, who happened to be the Emperor. Did you know that after the Austrian army chased the French army out of northern Italy in the War of the Spanish Succession Emperor Joseph I collected millions of florins in imperial war tax from the states in Northern Italy in 1708? If Victor Amadeus had proclaimed himself King of Piedmont, he would have run the risk of becoming Victim Amadeus. In England lands and titles confiscated from traitors were often restored in whole or in part to their heirs after a generation or two. But in the Holy Roman Empire confiscated lands were usually gone and lost forever for the descendants of the traitor, usually being granted to a loyal relative of the traitor. Duke Ferdinand Charles of Mantua and Montferrat had his duchies confiscated in 1708 for supporting the French, for example.
