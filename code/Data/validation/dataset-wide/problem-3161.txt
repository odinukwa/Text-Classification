Probably they got well mixed in the "generic Russian" gene pool, with not a few other peoples, and beyond the possibility of distinction nowadays. By the way, if I recall correctly, the current scholarly opinion is that only the nobility converted to Judaism and not the mass of the people. Hard to tell, though, as the sources are rather nebulous. If, however, the conversion was indeed limited to the nobility, then it'd be a very serious blow against the theory that Ashkenazi Jews are descended from Khazars. 

I think that another explanation is also possible. We can safely assume, I think, that Napoleon was burning with ambition to achieve fame and power from an early age. But in 1785 under the ancien regime a young officer from a minor nolbe family hailing from a recently-annexed backwater province could hardly expect much in the line of fame an power in France, so his best bet would be to stir up something on his native island. So to speak, he might have been acting according to Caesar's maxim that it's better to be the first man in a village than the second - or the 20,000th in this case - in Rome. After the Revolution, of course, everything has changed and the upheaval in France could carry an ambitiouns subaltern very high, so there was no need or sense in wasting one's talents and time in a backwater anymore. 

Monotheism This does depend on the definition being used for monotheism, which there appears to be some confusion about. Originally monotheism implied there was only one God, and all religions were searching for that God (possibly erring in their perception of God). In this sense, Judaism is not monotheistic, as it says there is one God, but other religions are NOT searching for God, but are worshiping false gods. Judaism In the sense of the belief of there only being one God, however, the oldest recorded monotheistic religion would be Judaism and its precursors. The religion describes only one God, the mention of other deities being restricted purely to idols and to poetic script. Atenism Some have tried to say Atenism is the oldest religion, from 1350 BC to 1320 BC. The religion, however, did acknowledge other gods, but some have excused that detail for political reasons, the king being urged to admit other gods. Judaism never acknowledged any other gods, but is sometimes excused of this on the grounds the Jewish people often practiced multiple religions. No doubt there were worshipers of Aten who also believed in other gods, so I believe this point to be inadmissible. Dating Judaism and Moses You can take several possible dates for the beginning of the religion. Judaism itself is taken from Judah (יהודה), and the modern form of the religion (containing all the books of the Tanakh) would've began around 516 BC. The date of Moses formalizing the religion is commonly stated as 1250–1200 BC. The biblical record dates it as 1450 BC, which agrees with several archaeologists' findings. Several theories would push this date back to 1650 BC, contemporary with the Bronze Age Collapse of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt and the sacking of Canaan. (Source: Patterns of Evidence: Exodus) Ancient Precursors Regardless of how you date Moses, Abraham predates Atenism by centuries. There is no evidence to suggest Abraham believed there were many gods, the only accounts we have of him suggesting he believed in one God. The genealogy of the bible is a good example of this, where he and others recorded a lineage back to the first man, Adam, who himself was a monotheist as described in the religion. The fact these beliefs are contemporary back to the time of Abraham is confirmed by similar folk history, legend and religion across the world. Many people talk of a first man, of a great flood that wiped out the Earth, of eight people who survived on a boat and repopulated the world, from Polynesia to China. This would make Judaism and its precursors the most likely candidate for the first monotheistic religion. 

As about everything written by Starikov, this is either a gross misrepresentation, woeful incomprehension, or just a figment of his wild imagination. In this case we have no less a witness than Anastas Mikoyan to refute Starikov: 

Looks like you've rediscovered Jaspers's concept of the Axial Age. However, if I understand correctly he did not posit that the Chinese and Western cultures influenced each other, but rather that they arose simultaneously under similar circumstances. Nevertheless, this might be a good starting point to explore from. 

Basically, this is a lot of tosh. This, ahem, quaint theory is a nice specimen of the modern neo-Stalinist cottage industry. Reality was much simpler: the purges were ordered and organized by Stalin; no alternative elections were ever held in the Soviet Union (till the late 1980s when the system was in its death throes). This was of course by design - the party and Stalin were not willing to relinquish their monopoly of power. The neo-Stalinists try to rewrite history in various ways. In this particular instance they try to argue that Stalin had nothing to do with the purges and that the "party elites" organized them in order to stimy Stalin's liberal reforms. This is really rich... One simple question can clear up all this smoke and mirrors: if the "elites" were behind the purges and if they organized them against Stalin - why didn't they just purge Stalin himself? 

Early grenades weighed about three pounds, apparently, and were generally thrown by tall, strong men. I haven't been able to find a figure on how far they were normally thrown, at what range they were considered effective. Does anyone know how far grenades could be thrown by hand, in the 17th (and early 18th) century? 

That implies something like 1 in 6 to 1 in 4 troops were casualties, if we assume the vast majority of casualties were from combat. Thinking of Justcal's statistics from before, it was about 58,000 casualties, 48,000 from battle. So, if we assume non-combat casualties were involved with the first statistic (questionable assumption) then about 1 in 12 are combat casualties. Then 1 in 7.2 to 1 in 5.2, for combat troops, using those estimates. Calculating the Daily Odds Now, if we assume this is at all accurate, we only need to do a little math to get the daily chance of being wounded or killed. I'll only go through the higher estimate, 1 in 5.2, for now, . The Vietnam war lasted about 20 years for the USA, and our numbers are on a per year basis. However, this doesn't matter, so long as we assume our soldiers only served one tour of duty for simplification. In a tour, the infantryman saw about , so Conclusion So, the odds on a daily basis are pretty low: 0.08%. And that's with the high estimate. Having less than a 0.1% chance of being a casualty sounds pretty good. But over 240 days... it stacks up to a 19% chance, which is not comfortable odds for risking life and limb. 

Prisons, as we understand them today serve the purpose of depriving an individual of their liberty; that idea of liberty did not exist at the time that you refer to. The liberty of an individual to live their life as they see fit within the restraints of the law is a modern concept, therefor the idea of punishing a person by depriving them of something of which they were not in possession of did not arise. In addition it would be hard to conceive as punishment a regime whereby offenders were taken to a place, fed, clothed and housed all at the states expense when such largesse on the part of the state was not offered to those in society who had committed no crime. Where such institutions as we might describe as prisons existed, to be incarcerated in such a place was not, in itself, the punishment. People in such places would be held there in order that they could fulfil their role as slaves or forced labourers or until such time as some other appropriate punishment could be carried out. Ancient law as based up the notion of ‘an eye for an eye’, that is retribution, where that retribution should seek to redress the loss felt by the victim of the crime. An eye for an eye can just as well be understood as, ‘a sheep for a sheep’ if a sheep has been stolen or ‘a son for a son’ if a person has been found guilty of murder. The act of cutting of a limb in the cases of theft is as much to do with preventing any future theft on the part of the guilty as it is with any sense of punishment. Such practises were the expedient and pragmatic approach to justice by a society that did not conceive of and therefor value liberty such that any loss of it could be considered punishment. 

I think this is a valid question. But the answer is a rather resounding no. For one thing, we have no shred of evidence for such a conjecture. For another, this conjecture cannot be squared at all with the fact that Columbus to his dying day insisted on having actually landed in India - had he been dissimulating about his knowledge of the existence of America, surely after he got there he could have come clean. The actual story how the great voyage was conceived is told with great detail (not all of it savoury) by Lord Acton in chapter 2 of his lectures on modern history. 

China was worse. I recall an episode from Wild Swans where the narrtor's mother had to confess her sins before revolutionary students during the Cultural Revolution. This was done while standing on her knees for half an hour - while the floor was strewn with shard of broken glass. 

This memorial plaque lists the numbers of Georgians who served in various wars and details the casualties. What I find odd is that for WWI, Korea, Vietnam, and Gulf round numbers are given for the participants, whereas for WWII a strangely exact number is given - 324373. The lists of casualties do not appear to be rounded throughout. Is there an explanation for this oddness? 

Actually, the universities were NOT an outgrowth of monasteries, but rather of the schools attached to great cathedrals. The difference is important, because this meant they were run by the secular clergy and not monks. 

Reportedly (from a source I cannot recall) the British had a very "interesting" guide about the Balkans. It had a sort of cheat sheet to the peoples around that area, with the stereotypical appearance, political views, and relations to other peoples in the Balkans. I saw an excerpt of this, but never managed for find a copy of this strange manual. Does anyone know any more details about it? 

Someone has told me that all nobility, when they hunted animals, it is in armour. They are further convinced that depictions of normally clothes hunters, are either not nobles, or they are wearing armour under their tight clothes. Thus, I would like to ask the truth of the matter. Do you know of cases of high-ranking nobility hunting dangerous animals, in armour and without armour? Written cases are preferred, as art can be interpreted very liberally. I'll mention that I'm aware hunting with and without armour has occurred, there's nothing stopping you from practicing either method. Some cultures seem to have preferred hunting in armour. 

In the Colonial Period, Europe had some ideas about the enlightenment that made slaves unpleasant to their sympathies. For that reason, despite the English having slaves in their colonies, you could become a free man by visiting Britain's shores (there were some interesting court cases related to this). More important to this era was poverty, which was a big issue in European cities. So there was no shortage of cheap labour; even with the dying out of serfdom. Serfdom lost popularity in Western Europe around the 1300s (though cases remained until the 1500s). The practice was continued in Eastern Europe for a lot longer, to try and fill the gap in the agricultural market that arose with the reduction of serfs. After the Napoleonic wars, serfdom mostly came to an end in Europe, save Russia. The place where a demand for cheap and harsh labour was in force, was in the colonies with their plantations. Recruiting people from the European homeland to farm this would've been difficult to convince them and expensive to pay them, so slaves were the economical way out. 

This is not a noble writing to the first among his equals. This is a noble writing to his royal master. And what is crucial - Pliny does not feel any awkwardness over the fact. He is writing with the easy grace of a born courtier, and so we must conclude that the final acquiescence to monarchy must have occured at least a generation before Pliny himself. While we do not have such candid and clear evidence for earlier reigns (perhaps then the veil of republican or quasi-republican fiction has not yet worn so thin), there are other bits of circumstantial evidence that can be adduced. For example, Svetonius tells us that Augustus took pains to maintain a fiction of elections for various magistracies: 

The institute he founded and directed till 1937 also did not overlive its creator by long - it was closed down in 1940 (though a rump of it was transferred to the aviation ministry). Was Gastev's execution part of a general clampdown on scientific management in the Soviet Union during the period (the way Stalin proscribed and presecuted scientists who worked in other fields he disliked, such as genetics and cybernetics) or was it because of other reasons? (He was an "old Bolshevik", that is member of a group which was also singled out by Stalin for elimination). To be sure, there seems to have been some persecution of the scientific management field:
