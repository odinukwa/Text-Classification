If by "steerer" you mean the top tube that turns in the bearings, it would be very bad for that to be bent, since it would seriously muck up the bearings, and ever getting it straight enough to NOT muck up the bearings would be unlikely. Apart from the bearings, with something like a conventional steel fork the twin concerns are fractures in the steel and fractures in the welds and/or castings that hold everything together. Generally if the bend is ONLY in the length of the metal tubing of one or both fork tines, the likelihood of a fracture is pretty small. But it's so hard to be sure that there are no beginning stress cracks in a weld or casting that using the fork (with or without straightening) is risky. If an attempt is made to straighten the fork, it's important that it be done carefully, in a way that will not put further stress on welds and castings. 

(Updated) A pad with a female thread, designed to accept an Allen-head bolt. This pad appears to be very much similar to the pad for V-brakes. A pad with an unthreaded stud with striations running parallel to the stud's length. A pad with an unthreaded stud with "ribs" (shallow grooves) about every 2mm along the stud's length. A pad with a smooth unthreaded stud. 

Strength is determined by the number of spokes, how they are arranged, and how they interface with the hub and rim. If you look at a normal "three cross" wheel, the spoke leaves the hub at an angle nearly tangential to the hub circumference. This way the stress on the hub is minimized. A "four cross" lacing (commonly seen on heavy touring bikes an the like) goes that one better and causes the spoke to be truly tangential to the hub circumference (plus the increased spoke length gives the wheel more "spring"). You rarely see "two cross" and probably never see "one cross" lacings, but "radial" lacing (where the spokes leave the hub at right angles to the circumference) is becoming fairly common, especially on front hubs of "mountain" or "cross" bikes. Radial lacing places considerable stress on a conventional hub, and with radially laced wheels you'll often see the spokes reversed, with the nipples on the hub end, because the hub must be redesigned to stand the stress. Additionally, both because a radially laced wheel is so stiff and because usually radial wheels have low spoke counts, the stress on the rim is higher, such that the nipples would be apt to pull through. So you'll sometimes see the bent end of the (reversed) spoke engaged in a slot in the rim or some such. Note that while radial laced wheels are stiffer against radial forces on the wheel, they don't resist torque very well at all -- if a rear wheel were to be radially spoked the torque of the drive train would cause the wheel to twist into a sort of spiral, hindering the transmission of power to the wheel circumference. Similarly, if disk brakes were used on a radial front wheel the wheel would twist severely when the disk brakes were applied. [However, it should be noted that some people like to lace their rear wheel with a cross pattern on one side and radial spokes on the other. This provides the needed torsional rigidity while permitting half the wheel to be radial, but it's not clear that there's any real advantage to the scheme.] Air resistance obviously increases with spoke count, and is affected by the profile of the spoke as well. Although air resistance is important to pro racers because the top of the wheel is moving forward at twice the speed of the bicycle, it's probably safe to say that the air resistance due to spokes on a standard 32-spoke three-cross wheel would not be noticed by most average bikers, even at fairly high speeds. The ultimate low-wind-resistance wheel is the disk wheel, of course, and there are other exotic designs with 1, 2, or 3 broad, flat "spokes" made of high-strength composites bonded to rim and hub. But generally you'll only see the disk wheels on rear wheels because the disk becomes a kite if it gets cross-ways to the wind as would happen on the front wheel. Weight is reduced by using more exotic materials (especially for the rim), and by reducing spoke count. The more exotic the rim, the more intimately the design of the rim ties into the spoking scheme. Some slight weight reduction is also possible by reducing the "cross" of the spoking (and hence reducing spoke length). And, of course, sex. Many of the above schemes (especially things like the low-spoke-count radially spoked front wheel with reversed spokes) have little practical benefit for the average cyclist, add cost, and reduce reliability. (Ever heard one of those fancy high-tension spokes go? It sounds like a gunshot. And if one breaks you're likely dead in the water until you can get to a bike shop, whereas with a standard three-cross 32-spoke wheel one can usually "limp home" if a roadside repair is not possible.) 

The challenge is to prevent the lock from being cut or pried open. Standard steel locks do this by using a steel bar, cable, or chain that resists bolt cutters and abrasive wheels due simply to the strength and hardness of the steel. However, one can also prevent the lock from being cut by "frustrating" the cutting process somehow. For instance, a cable which flattens and mushes around when you attempt to use bolt cutters on it will be harder to cut. And a lock bar or cable which somehow contains materials that foul abrasive blades will frustrate the standard angle grinder type cutter. A single approach would not be sufficient to protect against most attacks, but a combination of several "frustrating" technologies would probably work (and possibly be lighter than the conventional lock). But, to my knowledge, no one has attempted to market such a lock. Update: There recently was a lock introduced which sorta does the above. It's U-lock where the "U" contains a nasty liquid which is supposedly non-toxic but which makes you vomit. Anyone trying to cut through the "U" would be in for a nasty surprise. 

One point I don't see mentioned is potassium. In particular, on a hot day it's possible to remain reasonably hydrated, maintain your sodium (salt) reserves well, but exhaust the body's available potassium. The result is muscle weakness and cramps, and the cure (to the extent that there is one) is potato chips (which contain a relatively high level of potassium, as well as salt). Bananas are also an excellent source of potassium (and, truth be told, most meats and dairy products are as well, though they're not a handy as pannier food). One needs to keep in mind, though, that, after eating these foods, fresh potassium does not instantly course through your veins and into your muscles. The symptoms of low potassium (particularly muscle cramps) may continue for several hours after ingesting potassium-rich foods. 

My standard approach, and the approach I'd recommend for starting, is to use the front derailer to select a "range" -- big ring for flat road with no headwind, middle ring for slightly more challenging conditions (or riding in traffic), and small ring for serious uphill climbs. Then adjust the rear to select a comfortable gear within that range. Or, if you're really unsure, just select the middle ring in front and only shift the front up/down if you notice that you need to. As you gain more skill you'll notice that you can often, say, shift up in the front and down in the rear (or vice-versa) to achieve an "in-between" gear between two rear-only choices. But with modern bikes with 20+ speeds total this is not as important a "feature" as it was on old 15-speed bikes. 

Ideally, search for a possible uphill turn you can make. Otherwise, drag your feet. If you're going fast, sit as far upright as possible to increase wind resistance. Getting off the pavement into grass (or firm sand) will generally slow you, but of course if you're going too fast it can throw you. You can also run through puddles, if you see any -- a lot of energy is dissipated that way. If you're inevitably going to hit something, try to pick the softest something. It's never been my impression that zig-zagging slows you very much. If the problem is due to wetness, simply staying on the brakes will generally squeegee off the water, and eventually enough heat will develop to produce more friction. In rain it's always best to anticipate braking needs and begin early, to dry the brakes. 

The sense of instability is mostly because your arms are not spread out. The farther apart you spread your arms, the more stability you get, simply because it takes more motion of the arm to rotate the steering tube by a given amount. This effect is amplified on a hybrid, which usually will have a somewhat steeper steering angle, leading to less inherent stability than a road bike. You'd probably be happier with some sort of "bar end" extensions (if you choose to not simply replace the bar, or the bike). 

Though the physicists tell us we're full of it, many cyclists at least "perceive" that wind resistance is greater on relatively humid but cool mornings. (And, of course, if you and your co-workers were out drinking together the night before, that could have something to do with it.) 

Generally speaking, that style of bearing ("sealed cartridge bearing") is "permanently lubricated". You do not lubricate them and you replace the entire assembly if anything goes wrong with them. A few people have claimed success by gently prying back the flexible gasket and injecting grease with a syringe, but these claims are subject to legitimate skepticism. Note that the inside diameter and the outside diameter are not supposed to move relative to the external parts that hold them. If they are slipping it indicates that the "holders" are not tight enough or the bearing is failing and needs to be replaced. 

I'm not aware of any recent studies, but the League of American Bicyclists (formerly League of American Wheelmen) has done some studies in the past that were reasonably convincing that helmets prevent serious head injuries and save lives overall. But, interestingly, when they crunched the numbers they decided that the health effects of riding are positive (life-lengthening) even if you don't wear a helmet, so they have (at least in the past) not advocated for mandatory helmet laws. Better to not wear a helmet and cycle than to use the helmet as an excuse to not cycle. But I haven't looked at any of this in 15-20 years -- since last I was involved Boy Scout cycling stuff. [Incidentally, as to whether helmets save lives, when I was helping with Scouts there were two incidents where Scouts were thrown from their bikes and landed on their heads, in both cases with enough force to crack the helmet. There is no doubt that, without the helmets (that ARE mandatory for Scouting events) the boys would have been seriously injured rather than (as they were) just scratched up.] [It should also be noted that the most injury accidents with bicycles are between a bike and some stationary object, or simply falls. Motor vehicle collisions are a relatively small fraction. Neither of the accidents I mentioned above involved a motor vehicle, and one was on a bike path. Helmets are needed even when not riding in traffic.] 

Take a "short cut". I commonly take a "short cut" on my 10-mile commute, riding up to a neighboring community and then down a bike trail, adding another 17 miles. Added: The advantage to this is that you're already dressed and on your bike, so the time required will be ONLY the additional time you actually spend on your bike. Get going 90 minutes earlier in the morning or get home 90 minutes later in the PM -- no extra changing, no extra showers, no extra hauling the bike around. 

If you have a 3x front, odds are you will spend about half your time on the center ring and the other half split between the other two. So you get roughly twice as much wear before front rings first need replacement. If you have a 3x front and use it "normally", you will tend to use the larger front ring with smaller rear cogs, and vice-versa, reducing the amount of cross-chaining you'd have as compared to a single ring. Having an 11x back will generally spread wear a bit more widely than an 8x back, meaning the 11x can go a little further than the 8x, on average. Net-net is that it doesn't really matter. What's important is which arrangement best fits your riding style.
