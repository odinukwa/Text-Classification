If U-shaped in cross-section, it is plausible that these are the partial remnants of lava tubes. See, for example, Morphology and mechanism of eruption of postglacial shield volcanoes in Iceland (Rossi, 1996). It is difficult to propose more detailed formation mechanisms in the absence of significantly more information about the structure. 

(There's an absolutely classic paper on this, and a lot of the literature is well worth a read for the sheer understated "well, yep, that was a problem.") In fact the ash lofted across Europe following the Eyjafjallajökull eruption was mostly below 63μm in diameter, since that's what can persist without rapidly sedimenting out, but the explosive nature of the initial eruption meant that "... even the nanoparticles are far from round. Their sharpness makes them particularly abrasive." In contrast, loess has been extensively weathered. The authors add: "The very sharp, hard particles put aircraft at risk from abrasion on windows and body and from melting in jet engines." For more details on volcanic ash and turbine engines, see Gunn & Wade and, for that matter the rest of the volume. 

We have no evidence to suggest that the rate or magnitude of earthquakes has, in general, increased: while earthquakes are having a greater effect on humans, this is entirely - as best we can tell - due to increased population density, and the propensity of people to build cities immediately above major fault planes (because they channel water to the surface along impermeable fault debris). Populations settling above the surface expressions of major faults isn't much of an issue when you're living in tents in a sparse community, but once you get high-density populations living in skyscrapers with poorly-enforced building regulations death and injury rates rise very rapidly. For more detail and onward references see the USGS FAQ on this topic. For statistics on extreme weather phenomena/natural disasters, particularly relating to precipitation and flooding, the IPCC is an excellent resource. There is of course some degree of difficulty with reporting bias (as with earthquakes), but the IPCC are extremely rigorous in calculating - and providing - bounds on probabilities and certainties. In particular, see Working Group 2: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability; their summary for policy-makers has to say: 

There are some other folk in agreement, in particular Strugnell et al. (2012) on the topic of genetics of an Antarctic octopus (yes, really); and Vaughan et al. (2011) review available data and find strong biogeographical evidence for the existence of such a trans-Antarctic seaway, with four possible candidates and extensive discussion of when it might most recently have been open: 

One possible key is isotopic fractionation via biological processes - see dating the development of the C4 photosynthetic pathway, and specifically isotopic fractionation between carbon-13 and carbon-14. δ13C from volcanic degassing is markedly different to that from biological sources; the arguments for human involvement in climate change (see e.g. the IPCC) rely on the changes in δ13C since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution: the value has shifted markedly towards that of the hydrocarbons we've been burning from its pre-Industrial value. (As for how we know atmospheric δ13C for CO2 prior to the Industrial Revolution - the answer is polar ice cores!) Thus the arguments for/against abiogenic oil rest on (1) isotopic ratios, and (2) other geochemical indicator ratios; see e.g. Jenden et al. (1993). Höök et al. (2010), in a review of the arguments for biogenic and abiogenic formation processes, say: 

First things first about Laki: it's in Iceland, which means its source is a combination of an ocean ridge and a mantle plume. The plume contribution means that the source composition is relatively undegassed (unlike the source for most mid-ocean-ridge basalts (MORBs)!) and very basic, so contains relatively high concentrations of sulphur and other volatiles. Secondly, it was actually a pretty high-volume eruption: per Gudmundsson (2011) it has been estimated that it produced 14 km3 of lava - compare with the estimated average global rate of magma emplacement and volcanic output of 26-34km3 per year. The eruption style during the Laki eruption - not dissimilar to other Icelandic eruptions - is believed to have promoted volatile emissions during the eruption, including liberating up to 50% of F originally dissolved in the melt: 

Chert and flint are commonly found in chalky deposits (and have obvious importance in human history as tools). What are the processes of diagenesis of these silica-rich nodules in otherwise silica-poor horizons? 

Factors determining the maximum possible height of mountains include the rate of uplift versus the rate of erosion[a] and rock strength. Rock strength is controlled by the type and internal structure of the rock in question. There is some evidence that once mountains extend above the snow line, glacial and periglacial erosion have a stronger control than exhumation/uplift rate (Brozovic et al, 1997; Egholm et al, 2009). Everest and the Himalaya have reached their maximum possible elevation: the formation of the Tibetan plateau is due to the failure of rocks preventing the maintenance of discrete mountain peaks. The principle of uniformitarianism suggests that - subject to differences in variables discussed by Egholm et al, including crustal composition - the Himalaya and Tibetan plateau are an excellent approximation to the maximum achievable height of mountain ranges. However, identifying which specific palaeoranges were tallest (as opposed to calculating a plausible upper limit on height) is a significantly harder problem to solve. [a] Though note that the rate of erosion increases as the rate of uplift increases - for more on erosional equilibrium, see e.g. Riebe et al (2000). 

That the Tibetan plateau is of such uniform height corresponds neatly to calculations suggesting that this is the maximum possible height for such features if they are of typical crustal composition. 

In the context of Tibet, what this means is that rock has a yield strength: pile it up high enough and it will break (via earthquakes); and if you make a big enough pile, especially of continental material, then the concentrations of radiogenic isotopes will be high enough to significantly raise the temperature - and lower the strength - of the rock in question. In the case of Tibet and the Himalaya, height increase is due to north-south shortening as the Indian plate impacts the Eurasian plate, i.e. the Tibetan plateau initially formed via exactly the same process as the Himalaya. In order to get an approximately stable height, this increase has to be balanced by decrease. The principle processes causing decrease in height in Tibet are: 

Blueschist has a mineral assemblage such that it must have formed at high pressures and low temperatures. It must therefore form in subducting slabs (and I believe this correlates with the locations in which it's found). However, that leaves the issue of how to get it to the surface rapidly enough that it doesn't heat up sufficient to reequilibrate and lose the characteristic mineral assemblage. What are the currently favoured explanations/processes for such rapid exhumation from depth? 

Thus the significant fluorine release at Laki seems to have been due to a large-volume eruption degassing halogens extremely efficiently, with a relatively high initial fluorine concentration in the melt (~400ppm). 

Note, however, that over the course of the study they recorded 29 events, of Ml 0.7–5.7. Meanwhile Sobolev et al. (2012)2 - in a journal I do trust - say in their abstract: 

As Peter Jansson explains, sea level rise purely due to melting of land-based global ice works out "to approximately 66.1 m sle." An issue with respect to sea-level rise that isn't often mentioned (especially not in disaster movies!) is that thermal expansion of the sea - i.e. water expanding as global temperatures rise - will also have a huge effect: see section 3.7 of the IPCC report. The magnitude of this effect is of course dependent on the magnitude of rise in global average temperature.

The best I have been able to turn up is the paid BD-logs service, which provides standardised lithology for borehole data. Open Geospatial Consortium data all appears to be listed on the Geoservices page, and does not appear to include a lithological database/lexicon. The French Geological Reference Platform does not appear to include a standalone database. The BRGM's list of resources also does not appear to provide pointers to any relevant information. Given that the FRGM is in active development, it seems plausible that this is not in fact a dataset that currently exists. 

To avoid classifying seamounts by arbitrary sea level (dependent on availability of surface water), the key point is then that seamounts are features of volcanic origin that rise over 1000m above oceanic crust. The Hawai'i-Emperor seamount chain is of volcanic origin; all of the islands in this chain are seamounts. Mauna Kea only rises 4207m above sea level - but measured from its base on the oceanic plate it is 10100m high, much taller than Mt Everest. Mauna Kea is - pretty conclusively - the highest seamount in the world. The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute agrees. 

This year, Ahmed et al. (2014) advances the argument that Siljan Crater oil is unambiguously of biogenic origin due to the copresence of molecules of "known" organic origin (specifically terpane and sterane biomarkers). As for a definitive answer, [Wang et al. (2014)7 say: 

Biostratigraphy - observing which fossils were present in which stratigraphic units, and using minimally-deformed sequences to determine age order - gives us relative ages of fossils. Absolute ages, however, rely on geochemical chronometers: just like dating the reversals in the Earth's magnetic polarity by establishing how old the oceanic crust that records them, or working out when volcanic eruptions happened. Which chronometer you use depends on exactly what you're working with, but what they all have in common is that they use radiometric dating: the "ticking clock" is radioactive decay, which proceeds according to a radioactive isotope's half-life. Radiocarbon dating can be used for the most recent of these, but the example I'm going to use is uranium-series decay in corals - even though it's a weird one, because unlike most systems it doesn't measure parent-daughter ratios, but rather how closely the system has approached secular equilibrium. Uranium is soluble in natural waters at conditions found on the Earth's surface; thorium, however, is not; so corals (predominantly calcium carbonate), while growing, continuously incorporate uranium but not thorium. Once they stop growing, this is no longer true - the amount of uranium incorporated in the coral is now fixed. Uranium-234 decays to give thorium-230, which is itself radioactive, with a significantly shorter half-life. At secular equilibrium, the rate of thorium-230 production (from uranium-234 decay) equals the rate of thorium-230 decay, so 230Th reaches steady state. Provided secular equilibrium has not been reached and the concentration of 238U (234U's parent) is also known, it is possible to calculate how long ago the coral stopped incorporating new uranium - became a "closed system". The mathematics of U-series secular equilibria are well understood but somewhat tedious, and are freely available.

You particularly mention black shale: the reason it's important is that shale is composed of mud- and silt-sized particles, so to form requires an environment with very slow-moving water such that the particles can effectively sediment out - and such that larger clastic material has already been deposited. The higher the water flow rates, the larger the sediment particles that can be carried: so continental margins frequently have significant sand deposits, whereas quicker-moving mountain streams can move pebbles (and fast-moving floods can manage boulders!). Thus black shales represent deep-sea environments, far from continental margins and related clastic input via rivers. Fossil distribution is a very good guide to faunal habitat. There are trilobite species found in Scotland and Canada and nowhere else; trilobite fossils are found only in shallow environments (and some were not just benthic but infaunal, i.e. lived in the mud1) and show no evidence of being able to swim, let alone long distances, so this fossil distribution is taken as evidence of proximity of these continental plates in the geologic past. Nautiloids, on the other hand, are known - from modern examples - to be pelagic rather than benthic, and to require a pretty narrow temperature range. Nonetheless, in spite of their very specific requirements, nautiloid fossils are found in deep-sea sediments from regions that could not possibly have been that warm (as evidenced by e.g. ice-rafted debris indicating local presence of icebergs). As a pelagic species, their remains are widespread because they are carried through the ocean, only gradually settling out. Graptolites are also ubiquitous: they are found in sediments from every palaeodepth though (their preservation potential varies between different sediment types). And especially, as you note, they are found in black shales - deep-sea/abyssal plain sediments. Given what we know about the abyssal plain (poor bottom circulation, low oxygen) and the likely requirements of graptolites as plankton, it's evident that to be found in these sediments - as well as, more rarely, in shallow limestones - the only possible explanation is that they were a pelagic species. 1 And on a complete tangent: the lenses of trilobite eyes are made out of calcium carbonate, oriented along the single optic axis that didn't result in them seeing double. Now, most infaunal trilobites were blind: no point in being able to see if you live in an environment with no light. However, some of them had eyes on stalks. 

To start with a definition, the tropopause is the boundary between troposphere and stratosphere; within the troposphere temperature decreases with increase in altitude (the temperature profile is dominated by radiative heat from the Earth's surface), whereas in the stratosphere temperature increases with altitude (the temperature profile is dominated by solar radiation). Increases in troposphere temperature are associated with increase in tropopause height. Factors in play include the amount of water vapour being evaporated from equatorial seas; interannual variations in tropopause height can result from both local and large-scale driving forces. The tropopause responds to the average temperature of the entire underlying layer: this is higher at the equator and lower at the poles. 

Particle size is the key issue. Saharan loess (wind-blown dust) must have a small enough particle size that it can be lofted by ordinary wind speeds: typically, it is in the 20-50μm size range. Particle sizes lofted into the upper atmosphere during explosive volcanic eruptions can be much higher: "The explosive ash was bimodal in size distribution with peaks at about 25- and 200-μm diameter... For the typical ash, diameter peaked at approximately 500μm" (Gislason et al., 2011), though this effect only has particular significance in close proximity to the vent. The risk to aircraft is explained: 

Therriault et al. (1993) suggest an initial diameter of 192-300km. Turtle & Piarazzo (1998) suggest a smaller initial diameter but make no estimates of the depth; they do, however, suggest an impactor of 10-14km diameter. Dietz (1961) describes the impact crater as "40km across and 16km deep" - i.e. does not take into account the extensive erosion that has occurred in this location. Grieve et al. (2008) also give no estimate of transient depth. Numerical modelling of the impact diameter-crater depth relationship has been carried out: see e.g. Wünneman & Ivanov (2003), which also discusses crater morphology; meanwhile Turtle et al. (2003) suggest that for an impactor of 10km diameter the maximum transient crater depth will be 24km. It seems likely that difficulty in estimating transient depth arises due to the 2Ga history of erosion in the area; as such the best option is probably to appeal to uniformitarianism, and assume that the Vredefort-forming impact obeyed the same diameter-depth relationship as has been modelled for the population of recent craters in works cited above. 

The 2011 AGU poster has been cited once, by Burtin et al. (2013)1, who say in their abstract ... event activity was positively correlated with the precipitation intensity... -- but more importantly, in the body of the paper, this: 

The Elsevier service Geofacets "is designed to search for, and extract, maps, sections and other geographically-referenced geoscientific data from a very large and growing volume of published content", and as such is perhaps relevant -- though it focusses on georeferenced data rather than on scientific articles. 

Barnes & Hillenbrand (2010) argue that there is faunal evidence for a late-Quaternary trans-Antarctic seaway. From the abstract: 

The intraplate compression responsible for this uplift has had a couple of explanations over the years; historically, it's been ascribed to Alpine collision, i.e. the collision of the Alpine orogen with the Europe. However Kley & Voight (2008) reviewed evidence and concluded it was the effect of Africa-Iberia-Europe convergence: 

The only two recent publications claiming any link at all between cyclones/extreme precipitation events and significant seismic activity (i.e. not "minor" landslips) are from sources I don't trust: a 2013 paper in a journal I've never heard of (International Journal of Geosciences) before, and a 2014 publication in "Natural Hazards and Earth System Sciences Discussion. I'm dubious about them not because they are open access but because I am concerned about methodology and sources. While this mechanism was mentioned to me as plausible as an undergraduate at Cambridge in approximately 2012, the department's view seems to have shifted (per Burtin et al - Neils Hovius is very senior in the dept). The current evidence does not appear to support any short-term link between extreme weather events and significant seismic activity. Long-term links have not been ruled out but I have not found any substantiating evidence for such connections.
