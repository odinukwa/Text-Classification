I remember attending a talk by Barbara Jablonska at Knots in Washington (2009) in which she studied a knot in a geometric, rigid fashion. As the direction of projection varies over $S^2$, she obtained interesting surfaces by looking at the locus of a particular crossing (if memory serves). Here's an abstract of the talk, but I cannot find anything published. $URL$ 

Group Theory: Birdtracks, Lie's, and Exceptional Groups by Predrag Cvitanovic has a graphical way of presenting the idempotents. His book is available online here: $URL$ 

You probably know all of this already, but here goes... Write $C'_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} p_{x,w} T_x$ where $p_{x,w} \in u\mathbb{Z}[u]$. Now, the other basis can be defined by applying the involutive automorphism $b: \mathcal{H}_n \to \mathcal{H}_n$, given by $b(T_w)=T_w$ and $b(u)=-u^{-1}$. 

The first section of Representation Theory by Fulton and Harris is a great introduction to representations of finite groups (about a quarter of the book, if I remember correctly). There are lots of examples and exercises. The rest of the book is devoted to Lie theory. 

When $n=2$, the map is an isomorphism and we have no choice. $$F^{(2)} = \frac{1}{[2]}(T_1+q^{-1}),$$ which projects onto the $q$-eigenspace for $T_1$. In other words, it is the idempotent corresponding to the partition $(2)$. 

Aaron Lauda has a nice description using the package XY-pic here. There are commands that generate pieces of knots (such as crossings in various orientations), although I prefer just using the \crv "curve" command to make splines. 

The Euclidean ball takes up the most space in dimension 5. $V = \frac {8 \pi^2} {15} R^5 \approx 5.26\ldots R^5$ 

Since, $b$ commutes with the bar involution, this basis is bar invariant as well. Explicitly, $C_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} (-1)^{\ell(w)+\ell(x)} \bar p_{x,w} T_x$. So $C_w = \bar{P}^{-1} P C'_w$ which seems hard to compute in general. 

You have to introduce the language of sheaves. Then, the coefficients can be described succinctly as a locally constant sheaf. Alternatively, you can view the coefficient system as a bundle over your space $BG$ with $A$ fibers. Locally, the coefficients behave as if the $G$-action were trivial, but if one considers a loop that represents a nontrivial element of $\pi_1(BG) = G$, monodromy comes into play. 

1 Many important properties of topological spaces are preserved by continuous maps (but not necessarily open maps): connectedness and compactness come to mind immediately. But more importantly, the most familiar, natural maps that we can define are continuous, but not necessarily open: polynomials $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$. 2 Inverse image of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup. 3 There is a contravariant functor from the category Set to itself, mapping a set $X$ to its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and sending the morphism $f:X \to Y$ to the inverse image $f^{-1}:\mathcal{P}(Y) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$. A "purely symmetric" function would be a symmetric relation on $X \times Y$, no? Functions are, after all, relations with an extra property that deliberately breaks the symmetry! 

Suppose $(X,I)$ is an almost-complex real analytic manifold where $I$ is a real-analytic almost complex structure. Suppose there exists an $I$-almost complex submanifold $M\subset X$ where this means that $M$ is a real analytic submanifold such that given a tangent vector $v$ to $M,$ then $I(v)$ is also tangent to $M.$ Suppose that the restriction of $I$ to $M$ is integrable. The question is: are there conditions under which this implies that $I$ is integrable on all of $X?$ I would be supremely surprised if the condition was empty, namely that this always implied that $I$ was integrable, although I wouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Nevertheless, a condition such as the restriction of $I$ to $M$ being Stein, or something of such a global nature, doesn't sound quite so ridiculous. I should add that in the exact situation I'm considering, $X$ is non-compact (it's topologically a ball) and $M$ is non-compact (also topologically a ball) and the restriction of $I$ to $M$ is Stein, and lots of other nice things you might dream it to be as a complex manifold. Edit: I've just realized that I need to add that $M$ is not of complex dimension one, otherwise the integrability of $I$ restricted to $M$ is a trivial consequence of there being no $(2,0)$-forms on $M.$ Thanks for any comments or ideas you might have. 

It follows from Weil's rigidity theorem $URL$ that given any uniform lattice in $SU(n,1)$ with $n>1,$ it has no local deformations, in fact no non-trivial first order deformations. If $n=1$ then the the symmetric space is the real hyperbolic plane and there is a large family of deformations for surface groups. Now, if you don't require the lattice condition, then there may or may not be deformations. The case of a surface group is the most well understood (to me at least). It is a theorem of Toledo that a discrete surface group (here surface means closed, oriented and genus at least two) in $SU(2,1)$ which stabilizes a totally geodesic holomorphic hyperbolic plane in $\mathbb{CH}^2$ is locally rigid. But, surfaces groups which stabilize a totally real lagrangian hyperbolic plane in $\mathbb{CH}^2$ admit many deformations, these are so-called complex hyperbolic quasi-Fuchsian groups and their deformations are still far from well understood. Maybe Misha Kapovich (who posts here and is an expert) might add some more interesting comments at some point. 

$(M,J)$ is an almost-complex manifold. $(N,I)$ is a complex manifold where $I$ is the integrable almost-complex structure. $p$ is almost-holomorphic, that is $dp\circ J=I\circ dp.$ The fibers of $p,$ which are $J$-holomorphic by the previous condition, are holomorphic in the usual sense. That is, the almost complex structure $J$ restricted to any fiber $p^{-1}(x)$ for $x\in M$ is integrable. 

$\mathbb{H}^{0}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})$ identifies with infinitesimal automorphisms. $\mathbb{H}^{1}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})$ identifies with infinitesimal deformations. There exists an obstruction map $Ob: \mathbb{H}^{1}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})\rightarrow \mathbb{H}^{2}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet}\otimes \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})$ such that $\alpha\in \mathbb{H}^{1}(X, \mathcal{A}^{\bullet})$ satisfies $Ob(\alpha)=0$ if and only if $\alpha$ is tangent to an honest deformation. 

Caveat lector: This does not address your questions directly, but I think that it's interesting and somewhat relevant. The $n$th Catalan number counts the number of walks of length $2n$, beginning and ending at the origin, in the positive cone of the root lattice of type $A_1$. This counts the dimension of the invariant subspace of endomorphisms of $2n$-fold tensor power of the standard irrep $V$, relating back to Scott's answer. This phenomenon generalizes to other root systems. 

I apologize that this is vague, but I'm trying to understand a little bit of the historical context in which the zoo of quantum invariants emerged. For some reason, I have in my head the folklore: The discovery in the 80s by Jones of his new knot polynomial was a shock because people thought that the Alexander polynomial was the only knot invariant of its kind (involving a skein relation, taking values in a polynomial ring, ??). Before Jones, there were independent discoveries of invariants that each boiled down to the Alexander polynomial, possibly after some normalization. Is there any truth to this? Where is this written? 

Gauss defined the linking number of two closed curves $\gamma_i: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with an integral. 

In modern terms, this measures the degree of the Gauss map $\Gamma(\gamma_1,\gamma_2): S^1 \times S^1 \to S^2$. See $URL$ 

Alexander's Theorem guarantees that every oriented link is the closure of some braid. In other words, the map $$ \displaystyle \coprod\_n \mathcal B_n\longrightarrow \{\text{ oriented links }\} $$ is surjective. One algorithm (I'm actually not sure that it's Alexander's original demonstration) involves choosing a basepoint in the complement of a diagram for the link and applying Reidemeister moves until the resulting diagram winds around the point in a consistent direction, at which point the diagram is manifestly the closure of a link. 

Here's a recent example. $URL$ Adam McDougall constructs a "diagramless" homology theory that ends up being essentially equivalent to Khovanov homology. 

Background Inside the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n$ (with loop value $\delta=-[2]$ and standard generators $e_1,\ldots,e_{n-1}$), the Jones-Wenzl idempotent is the unique non-zero element $f^{(n)}$ satisfying $$ f^{(n)}f^{(n)} = f^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad e_i\;f^{(n)} = 0 = f^{(n)}e_i \quad \textrm{for each } i.$$ Consider the Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_n$, $n\ge3$, normalized so that $(T_i-q)(T_i+q^{-1})=0$, where $q$ is generic. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the two-sided cellular ideal generated by canonical basis element $$C_{121} = T_1T_2T_1-qT_1T_2-qT_2T_1+q^2T_1+q^2T_2-q^3.$$ The assignment $\mathcal{H}_n \rightarrow TL_n$ given by $T_i \mapsto e_i + q$ is a surjective $\mathbb{C}(q)$-algebra homomorphism with kernel $\mathcal{I}$. We can lift the generators $e_i$ in $TL_n$ to the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements $C_i=T_i-q \in \mathcal{H}\_n$. In fact, we have $C_{121} = C_1C_2C_1 - C_1$, hence the relation down below. Rescaling a bit, $E=-\frac{1}{[3]!}C_{121}$ is an idempotent, corresponding to the partition $(1,1,1)$. Actually, all of the primitive idempotents in $\mathcal{H}_n$ that correspond to Young diagrams with more than two rows live in the ideal $\mathcal{I}$. Now, any preimage of $f^{(n)}$ in the Hecke algebra (call it $F^{(n)}$) satisfies $$F^{(n)}F^{(n)} \equiv F^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad C_iF^{(n)} \equiv 0 \equiv F^{(n)}C_i \quad (\operatorname{mod} \mathcal{I})$$ Question 

Dynamic programming (and/or Stackoverflow) is your friend. You can easily calculate the probabilities of all the outcomes of the first coin flip, and you can easily move from the probabilities of all the outcomes of the first n coin flips to the probabilities of all the outcomes of the first n+1 coin flips (it's a linear transformation). 

Is your weight convex or concave? Your property 1) is self-contradictory. In the concave case, you can just take a uniform, polynomial size sample from your simplex and select your point from this selection based on the actual weights. In the convex case, the same algorithm works if the average of $w$ is comparable to the maximum (both can be obtained in polynomial time by taking a uniform sample and by local descent respectively). If that is not the case, then you can test the same property for the projection of $w$ onto one of the facets of $\mathcal L$. If this projection has the required property, you sample from that facet according to the projected weight and then sample from the fiber over the selected point according to $w$ if the property still does not hold, you take an $n-2$ dimensional face etc. When you get down to vertices, you already know that $w$ is concentrated around the vertices of $\mathcal L$ and can find neighbourhoods of them containing almost all of the weight and having the property of the average of $w$ being comparable to the maximum of $w$ within these neighbourhoods (choose the entire $L$ and repeatedly shrink it by a factor of $1-\frac{1}{poly}$ and test the condition). From those neighbourhoods, choose one according to their total weight, and within the chosen one, take a polynomial size uniform sample and sample according to $w$ from within it. 

I would also recommend Wall's Determination of the cobordism ring as a more primary source, it also contains the fact that all torsion is of order 2. 

Another way to look at the "official" solution is to notice that for statistical purposes it does not matter which couple gets the next child. You "request" children from the couples in whatever manner you want, you always get a 1:1 expected ratio in boys and girls, regardless of the pattern in which you choose the next couple to produce another child. 

Consider the complete graph on 7 vertices. It has 21 edges, so any set of cycles that utilizes each edge at most twice has size at most 42/3=14. But the cycle space of the graph has dimension 21-7+1=15, so you cannot have a basis with the requested property. 

For $K=1$ your arc passes through the pole of the function $\frac{exp(ixy)}{1+y^2} = \frac{exp(ixy)}{2i}\left(\frac{1}{y-i}-\frac{1}{y+i}\right)$, so you don't get a sensible value (the discontinuity of the integrand is asymptotically $\frac{c}{t}$ for $t$ around $0$). 

Take $M=\mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z}$, $T(x)=x+\alpha$ for some $\alpha$. If $\alpha$ is irrational, all orbits will be dense. Set $p=0$, then the set $A$ can be made to be infinite by choosing an $\alpha$ that can be approximated well: choose $\alpha$ from $B_1(\delta-2\cdot 10^{-k_1})$ for some $k_1$, then modify it at most by $10^{-k_1}$to make $10^{k_1} \alpha -[10^{k_1} \alpha] \in B_{10^{k_1}}(\delta-2 \cdot 10^{-k_2})$ and repeat ad infinitum.
