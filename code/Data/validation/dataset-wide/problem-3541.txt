-__________________________________________________________________ Answer B) The answer is positive according to Starmer, E., & Wise, T. A. (2007). Living high on the hog: factory farms, federal policy, and the structural transformation of swine production. Tufts University. They report the following estimations, among others: The feed costs for Hog represent ~$60\%$ of operating costs of CAFO's. That in the period $1997-2005$ feed subsidies meant that feed was sold at a price $26\%$ below production cost. Hence, the savings in operating costs for CAFO's was around $60 \% \times 26\% \approx 15\%$ (of Costs, not of Revenues). For the top four CAFOs in terms of market share, the authors estimated that this amounted to total cost-savings of $\approx 4.4$ billion USD for the 1997-2005 period. This paper appears to be an aggregator of previous more detailed studies, so lots of references. 

This is the rallying cry -in his paper Weil details many aspects and issues raised by the model, and the insights that it can provide. 

Stock prices predominantly are a quantification of the company's future growth and profit prospects. These are expectations, and are partly based on how the specific company performs currently and has performed in the recent past, but also on what the "general economic outlook" looks like (expectations again): if it is "gloomy", we expect that this will constrain even the best of companies. A usual "stock market bubble" is a situation where there is a unabated inflow of new investors (so new money, available to buy stocks, flows in the market), and where the general tendency of the prices of the stocks is to rise, and at a fast rate. Experience has taught us that even in a sample of a few hundred companies, there is no way that the majority of them will excel in economic performance at the same time. So the "short-term general tendency of stock prices to rise" must come either from positive expectations on the "general economic outlook" (rather than the assessment of each individual company separately), or from a "Ponzi-scheme" climate, which is often the case at least in new stock markets in emerging economies: investors demand to buy stocks simply because they believe they will be able to quickly sell them at a higher price to somebody else, irrespective of what the "economic fundamentals" are, as regards actual economic performance. This fuels stock prices which in turn represent a signal to outsiders that indeed, they too can come in and play this game. The thing with Expectations is that they may have no inertia: they can swing abruptly. So if in the middle of such a rising-stock-prices trend (which already may not be based on the actual economic performance, as said), comes a change of Expectations for the gloomier, suddenly investors "see" that the prices are over-inflated. The inflow of willing investors to buy at even higher prices suddenly stops, and those with the papers in their hands (but not with the money) start to accept lower and lower prices in order to reduce the damage. And this too happens fast. And this is when "the bubble bursts". 

Note carefully that by "homogeneity" the authors clarify that they mean homogeneity of degree one (i.e. "constant returns to scale"), while properly and mathematically speaking, a homogeneous function can have any degree of homogeneity. Also, Christensen et al. note that "additivity" in their approach is equivalent to the concept of "strong separability" in the utility context. In a utility context the "output" is one -utility-, and in macroeconomics, the predominant approach has just one input (consumption). In such a framework there is no point in using the translog. In the case where we want to model also leisure labor-choice, and we make the utility function, bivariate, then in the theoretical specification we predominantly use separable preferences. The translog specification has more of an empirical focus. By estimating a translog specification, one obtains coefficients estimates that can be used to test whether additivity and homogeneity holds in the data, while in the CD and CES functions, these properties are not testable. Another advantage is that the translog specification is suitable for a many-inputs/many outputs situation. Jorgenson and Lau moved to apply the translog function to a Utility context in Jorgenson, Dale W., and Lawrence J. Lau. (1975), "The structure of consumer preferences." Annals of Economic and Social Measurement, Volume 4, number 1. NBER, 1975. 49-101. They write 

I would suggest to look also into Alan Agresti's "Categorical Data Analysis". Here, you can see detailed Contents, and get a sense of the level of the book. Here, a user review discussing the differences between 2nd and 3d edition. Here, you can check out the 2003 2nd edition. The book is not focused on econometric applications, and this is exactly why I am suggesting it. It will give you the more general point of view on the matter, which sometimes brings fresh ideas in. My experience is with the 2nd edition. The book does not target other scholars but students and practitioners. From the extras, I particularly like ch. 16 "Historical Tour of Categorical Data Analysis", since it always benefits my understanding of the material to have a sense of how a scientific field evolved. 

No, but the correct ratio is $$\frac{\text{Assets} }{ \text{Equity}}$$ Reasoning: with "leverage" we want to obtain information on how much a company uses debt for financing. And we want to have the correspondence "higher leverage $\to$ more debt financing". Moreover, in order to be consistent with the definition of "leverage" ("the exertion of force by means of a lever"), we want the information on debt to be in the denominator, since we want to form a ratio. In order to achieve all these together, we need to put equity on the denominator, so that lower equity (implying higher debt for same level of assets) increases the value of the ratio, and we get the higher leverage. 

As for your first question: This is a purely mathematical tactic in order to obtain an (approximate) equation for $R$. The expansion of first order on the RHS is motivated by this fact, i.e. to bring $R$ alone "in the surface". The reason why the LHS is subjected to a second-order expansion is in order for something to be left (the variance term). Higher-order expansions of the LHS can certainly be applied. As for your second question, you are making a mistake. The center of expansion for the RHS expansion is the same as that for the LHS expansion, namely $w-E(x)$ (or equivalently, around $R=0$). It is meaningless (and it fails) to expand a function around its exact argument. Specifically we have $$u\left(w+E(x)-R\right) \approx u\left(w+E(x)\right) + u'\cdot [(w+E(x)-R)-(w+E(x))] = u\left(w+E(x)\right) - u'\cdot R$$ Finally, why not consider a second-order expansion on the RHS? We would then get $$u\left(w+E(x)-R\right) \approx u\left(w+E(x)\right) + u'\cdot [(w+E(x)-R)-(w+E(x))] \\+\frac 12 u''\cdot [(w+E(x)-R)-(w+E(x))]^2 $$ $$= u\left(w+E(x)\right) - u'\cdot R + \frac 12 u''\cdot R^2$$ Then we would obtain a quadratic polynomial in $R$, $$\frac 12 u''\cdot R^2 - u'\cdot R - \frac 12 u''\sigma^2_x = 0$$ $$\ R^2 - \frac {2u'}{u''}\cdot R - \sigma^2_x = 0$$ This has roots $$R_1,R_2 = \frac {(2u'/u'') \pm \sqrt{(2u'/u'')^2+4\sigma^2_x}}{2}$$ $$\implies R = \frac{u'}{u''} + \sqrt{\left( \frac{u'}{u''}\right)^2+\sigma^2_x}$$ You can totally validly use this expression for $R$, but I guess you understand why the simpler one is used instead. 

Using a simple textbook-approach, I will provide one possible answer here, showing that in this approach, the one thing that needs to be specified is "velocity of money" as regards sand dollars. I will use also the numerical values provided in the question, after cutting out six zeros. I assume that the Law of One Price holds, so $$P_s\cdot S_{USD/s} = P_{USD} \tag{1}$$ $P_s$ is "the price level" related to sand dollars, $P_{USD}$ is the price level related to USD, and $S_{USD/s}$ is the exchange rate we wish to find ("how many USD per one sand dollar"). While the price levels are usually price-indexes, here we are looking at a single good, oil, so we can take the $P's$ to mean "price of oil". The Sultan's oil is the only output that can be bought with sand dollars. And we do know the value of this output in USD $$P_{USD} \cdot Q_s = P_{USD} \cdot 20 = 1,000 \;\text{USD} \tag{2} $$ Using the Law of One Price, we get $$P_{USD} \cdot Q_s = P_s\cdot S_{USD/s}\cdot Q_s \implies S_{USD/s} = \frac {P_{USD} \cdot Q_s}{P_s\cdot Q_s} \tag{3}$$ (don't simplify). Assuming the Quantity Theory of Money, we have $$P_s\cdot Q_s = V_s \cdot \bar M_s \tag{4}$$ where $\bar M_s$ is the fixed amount of sand dollars available, and $V_s$ is the "velocity of money" in relation to sand-dollars (we will return to $V_s$). Inserting $(4)$ into $(3)$ and using also $(2)$ and the fixed value of $\bar M_s$ we have $$(4),(3),(2) \implies S_{USD/s} = \frac {P_{USD} \cdot Q_s}{V_s\bar M_s} = \frac {1,000}{V_s\cdot 100} = \frac {10}{V_s}$$ So, if we can find a value for $V_s$, we have found the exchange rate we are after. The velocity of money can be thought as "how many times that same unit of currency, say the same paper bill, will be used in transactions during a production cycle". The M1 velocity of money for USD is approximately $V_{USD} \approx 6$, using this value for the sand-dollars also, we get $$S_{USD/s} = \frac {10}{6} \approx 1.67$$
