In my short story, there is (today) technology to "bring back" the recent dead. Joanna Public dies of exposure and is found a week later in the woods a few miles outside of Portland, Oregon. Luckily Joe Doctor can 're-animate' her to her mental self fully. This is not like a zombie movie, she's fully capable, very happy to be back albeit a little bit stiff (ha) but had to have a lot of cleaning up and there are bugs and things. Then this starts to be common practice that can happen only a few weeks after death, and obviously not if someone was embalmed or cremated. It is for people who have died of natural causes. In my story, I want to know what are the implications of infectious disease, from bringing people back who have been exposed to decomposition. This is not a zombie story. I must use that tag, though, because I can't think of much else to describe it. They are mentally and happily back to normal; setting aside the science to bring them back, what (existing) diseases could they spread? 

Once under the ice, they encountered a very large, stable cavern of air between the water and ice. Their submersible 'surfaces, and when they look around they see water, and when they look up they see ice. It measures several kilometers wide and at least one km high to the ice. I am not married to those dimensions, though. It doesn't necessarily need to be breatheable, but it should be enough that they can exit their vehicle with scuba-like gear (ie - breathing and warming/cooling apparatus). However, bonus if they surface and the pressure, temperature, and composition are suitable, however shortly. I really hope this isn't as straightforward as it seems. 

If you want to avoid magic, maybe try comets. Some undiscovered comets could skim past Earth in a (very) precise manner, losing water. Comets are icy, and if they passed just close enough to aerobrake and continue past Earth, they would lose a lot of water into our atmosphere. That would require a lot of work and precision, and a lot of small comets, though, so maybe you will need the aliens afterall. 

He is a thinker, philosopher, scientist from the 9th/10th century. He was respected and known in the Arab-Islamic world, which stretched at some points from modern day Spain to Africa to East Asia. Arabic as a language has been very strictly kept from deviating much - obviously there will still be some lost in translation, but this is still helpful. 

From a different tact, you could consider that they have used their intelligence to domesticate a highly effective and loyal "attack" animal species. Training tigers, or something, over centuries to follow their will. Sidenote: I laughed out loud visualizing that. 

Expansion of small scale. A pontoon bridge has little environmental impact (historically) but can buffer in weather systems on large bodies of water. While I don't think it's practical, if you insist on a bridge, this would be a great alternative. There will be no disruption of major navigation, so why not? 

Short-Term no: Sprawl will increase Long-Term yes: Density will increase, sprawl will decrease As a geek, I can't wait for self-driving cars: in fact I worked on a prototype at Masdar City which was kind of like a self-driving car (it was self-driving, but not the kind you're talking about). As an Urban Planner I'm worried. Short-Term My biggest worry in the very near-future is that wealthy who purchase self-driving cars will do so in order to have hours of a commute where they can take care of work on their laptop for the duration. This makes it more convenient to live further from work. Long-Term In a world where we have fully automated cars, we will likely be so populated within urban growth boundaries, that we'll find much higher density. So Yes & No: Cities will become more dense. [EDIT as requested] The reason that autonomous vehicles will increase sprawl is that it makes it more palatable to drive longer distances when you can spend that time reading, typing, or even eating or watching TV. It also increases safety dramatically. So a commuter is more comfortable to live further away, because on the ride in, they could take their breakfast, and on the ride out they could watch their favorite sports team (examples). The reason that there might be increased density, in the longer term, is for finding a place to put people that doesn't obliterate our ability to grow crops, infringe on protected areas, etc. But this is less related to autonomous cars, and more related to the OP's question whether we'll see the cited urban landscapes. 

To Mars: Life What Mars doesn't have is biological life and the products that come from it. Soil: I don't care what Mark Whatney says, you can not make large volumes of soil with poop. Martian 'sand' is actually a fine dust, and while hydroponics will get you so far, there will be a time when people will want to plant with rich soil. The first real tree, for example. Soil takes generations to make by itself, with worms and bugs breaking down plant matter, and yes, dead things and poop enriching it. Even with human intervention, "making" soil to the quantities that Mars needs will be close to insurmoutable. Heaps of soil could come from Earth to get it started, as well as the types of compounds that can help make soil out of Mars' fine dust and regolith. Petroleum: Even if all of your energy sources come from the sun, you'll still want to make plastics on-site at Mars. Petroleum comes from dead things, as a fossil fuel, that Mars presumably doesn't have. Life: It's fun to grow your plants animals and population, but it's a lot quicker to import a lot of that. From Mars: Service Economy & Logistics Intellectual capital: Mars will need to diversify, because it really doesn't have much going for it. However, there will presumably be a lot of scientific research that can be conducted there, that can't happen on Earth (because of Mars unique atmosphere, etc.), especially just furthering our understanding of living in space: psychology, physiology, and all the sciences related to space life and travel. Tourism: This should be pretty self explanatory. Today, a honeymoon at the Maldives (or any remote location) could run an American couple ten thousand USD or more. If that's the same cost in the future to get to Mars, I WILL PAY. Transportation (& Logistics): Mars is a nice enough stepping point to other places in the solar system. The Moon or other places might be better in terms of their makeup, but your question presumes a population of skilled people on Mars. Dubai was about to run out of oil, so they invested in making themselves into a massive hub of trade and transport, some would argue successfully. Mars with limited resources will have to do the same. Be a desert planet that booms into a major center. Communications: Mars could establish itself as a center for communication between the inner planets and the outer planets, and can also invest on being a focus of arts & entertainment like aslum said in her answer. 

Yes. And no. We regularly detect fast moving, large asteroids, and their courses are tracked. So far, observers around the world have found and tracked more than 10,000 near-Earth objects. Most are a about 140m (I don't have a source for this). Rosetta was identified and tracked from near the distance Jupiter is from us, but it's pretty large. One of our observers would see anomolous moving 'asteroids' and get very curious about it. But we can't even see lunar equipment with any detail. So this would require the time and energy to go near this space war, which likely would be over or moved long before we got there. So we could see that there's something artificial moving around, but it would be very difficult to find out what was going on. Complicated by trying to get a trajectory if dots of light are moving long distances.
