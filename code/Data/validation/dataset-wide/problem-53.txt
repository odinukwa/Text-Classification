While I'd rather ponder the possibilities of a planet suspended in the Lagrangian point between the stars and mechanisms that lead to such configuration, here's what I think about sleep. It is not necessary for humans to sleep every night, 8 hours straight, or even regularly(though regularity is beneficial). While sleep deprivation does affect people very much like narcotic substances (diminished motor control, grogginess, up to even hallucinations), the need to sleep does not come from the changes in light levels. I've personally experimented and realized that about 28-hour cycle suits me better than the 24-hour locked-to-day cycle. During the time I didn't see the sky to assess the time of day for long stretches of time, so my body forgot the regular cycle and fell into what was "required", rather than timed by the setting and rising of the sun. There are several different sleeping patterns you can employ to alter your cycles, some claiming to be more efficient(requiring less sleep per 24hr cycle) than the solid "8 hours at a time" we've grown to hold as the status quo. Here's a blog of a person switching to 20 minute naps for every 4 hours, one of the most extreme polyphasic sleep cycles that maximizes the time you are awake per day. As he explains it too, while you might get more active hours to your day with a "powernapping" sleep schedule, the downfall is that those smaller windows of sleep need to be extremely efficient. After about two weeks of extreme sleep deprivation(not reaching REM sleep during the naps) his body adapted and he'd be able to get to REM stages within minutes of falling asleep. The final post(A year after he ended the experiment) details some of these pros and cons. Should you have no clear cycle of day and night, then time would simply not measured by the changes of light levels, but perhaps by some contraption that had a really reliable interval in it's action. This would also perhaps create a society where people are awake at whatever hours suite them, rather than the uniformed cycles most people on earth follow. A polyphasic sleep cycle might easily be the norm in such societies, since there would be no clear distinction between times of "day". 

I'd go for as random as they can get. Maybe a young star only has a huge asteroid belt and no planets, while some stars can sport a dozen or so planetoids and moons to boot. There's no way to determine "realism" for the average planetary system, as we don't have the technology to really determine other star systems currently. But for the explorer, vastly differing systems would increase the interest. 

Regarding the minions If the minions can be broken, your hiding is pretty much required to be magically linked to certain events in the realm. No matter how cryptic or scattered the information, if the knowledge can be forced from the most loyal of subjects, and the life of the villain depends on it, I wouldn't recommend trusting them with the information. A solution could be a means to contact the Overlord, but the location is not revealed in this method of contact. Like a summoning ritual that merely opens a channel to the mind of the Overlord. But onward to the suggestions of locations Pocket dimension Create a rift in the fabric of reality, hiding yourself in a dimensional pocket that can be accessed via some means. Non-Euclidian reality would be a tricky space to traverse for mere mortals that are accustomed to the laws of physics. Magical domes Impassable shields of natural or unnatural variety. Wild magic, electricity, a vacuum. There's a number of different means that would shield from most lifeforms. A spheroid vacuum with several minutes of traverse time to get to the villain would negate most lifeforms, provided the minions are undead. Outside the world Practical immortality and lich-like features make possible to create a space for yourself on celestial objects, or simply on orbit. This pretty much unifies the first two ideas into one: The location is for all intents and purposes impossible to get to, and if someone were to get close, lack of breathable atmosphere would hinder any intruders. "The Voldemort" Provided the Overlord is able to possess people, have it latch on to living beings. Powerful enough they could leech lifeforce from Dragons, basically zombifying a big brood mother for example. This could be mistaken by the people as just some random pestilence that plagues the land, not necessarily the Overlord. It would also create a possibility for a more accelerated timeframe for the evil to rise again, provided your world has powerful magical creatures to drain life from. "The Sauron" Like Sauron survived via the small token - ring, this Overlord could simply use mundane, yet precious objects as his phylactery. Perhaps a jewel in a crown of royals or a gem in a signet ring. This would also provide with a plothole for how the big evil stayed on top of current events during their absence. 

This is going to have to be either/ or, but not both. If you go for any sliver of realism, then it's going to be boring for the action players. As an example, Elite Dangerous. Even with the automatic docking and star drives, the game still suffers from boredom of the huge distances, if you don't like the serenity of cruising around in empty space. The universe is huge and on average, empty. Take the known planets to have life divided by the planets that don't have life and we'll approach zero quite fast. The distances are at best only mind bogling, and this translates to hours of boredom, even with your accelerated time frame. Kerbal Space Program also provides a good idea on how boring it really can get with any amount of realism: KSP has the whole solar system with its furthest away planet closer to the Kerbol sun than the Earth is to Sol, and still it takes several hours to transit even to the closest moon. Granted, the craziest missions where they just basically go with solid rocket boosters to the Mun and back take but minutes, but that's besides the point. Don't worry on the realism, create a balance of fun and "that's just ridiculous". In a 2D game, the only realism to be had might be to pre-plan your escape from and entry to any solar system, using planetary masses to do a gravity assisted boost. But it only makes sense if the fuel for long distance traveling is scarce enough to justify not just simply turning the accelerator to 11 and aiming for your target. 

Supervirus Kardashev Type III civilizations would likely have mastered completely genetic engineering and possibly even removing biological matter from their bodies entirely. To genetically engineer a plague that would look for specific markers in the host, identifying targets to be human and killing them off before self-destructing wouldn't necessarily be out of the realms of possibility for them. Ignore the rules Civilization so advanced it's colonizing the galaxy would likely be advanced enough to simply wipe humanity out by tampering with our nuclear arsenal. Sure, it would wipe out a significant portion of the flora and fauna alongside with human, but at the stage this alien race is at, a few millenia won't matter, and the earth will eventually heal without humans to poison it. Should someone come asking, they can just claim to have only just arrived, a bit too late that these silly little chimps just nuked themselves out of existence. Nevertheless it would still disrupt the native ecological systems. Mankind is a part of it, regardless of the destruction we cause. The rules if followed to the T prevent pretty much any interference until the species read Type I level of technology. 

What treats should a building have to be used by people for next 1000 years? I chopped my answer to three portions: Location, architecture and materials. Location To keep a building current and frequently used, it needs to be standing in a place where people are likely to still congregate centuries later. This might be impossible to predict exactly, but provided we don't have some serious innovations in transportation of both industrial products and people, waterways, railroad hubs and airports are places that will likely keep their relevancy as transit hubs. So building near or in industrial era built cities will be a good bet. Of course the immediate centre of any city is the place where the most reconstruction and demolition happens, so the epicenter of a bustling metropolis might not be the greatest option. But if people are able to transit to your building effortlessly, it has the potential to still be used after a long time. Architecture It won't matter how close to a city centre the building lies if it's unusable but in a single purpose. Large, open amphitheaters can serve in a myriad of social events, which is why things like the Verona Arena are still in use: Location, architecture and these days the intrinsic value of a historical site. The Spanish 100-year old church that was converted to a skate park serves as a good example of how even the most odd buildings can be reused with a little bit of effort. So as long as the building is designed in a way that it will be standing after a millenia, it can still be in use. Materials Pyramids and ancient ruins are mostly still standing because of the massive amounts of stone used to build them. They're not in their prior glory because of erosion, but the sheer volume protects them from being wiped out too quickly. But I'm assuming you don't wish for tons and tons of granite slabs, but something more "modern", there's three possible solutions for materials: Concrete, metal and metamaterials. Concrete Concrete is already designed in some cases to last up to centuries of rough use. High-volume intersections and highways in some cities in the US picked concrete for the more durable characteristics is has over asphalt. In buildings modern reinforced concrete has a few issues, namely the emphasis on rapid construction, more so than durability. This leads to corrosion in the reinforcements and cracking of the concrete in decades. But with proper design and material choices concrete could be a very potential candidate, especially if coated with.. Metals With metals you get a lot of benefits over concrete. Things like far superior fracture toughness: Most metals bend and deform and are in general quite malleable in comparison to concrete and stone. Of course constant swaying will wear any metal down too and it will fracture just like concrete would. Metamaterials This brings us to the third category of potentials, which is the various metamaterials currently being developed. Self-healing plastics or even shape retaining, light reacting and self-healing polymers. Any sort of smart materials that would be usable or even mass producible are still probably decades away from reality, though. All in all, the safest way to ensure your building is used after a millenia is to build it from huge stones and slightly off-centre of an active metropolitan area. 

You can make the tonnage affect the acceleration, therefore slowing them down and making it risky to try and haul a huge mass of cargo across the stars for a profit. The communication can be limited to either the nearest star systems. This can easily be justified with "signals can't go faster than light". This way you could have a system in play that shows a spreadsheet for the player on the known prices, coupled with the "age" of that information. These prices could even be updated on the fly, so as your flying closer to a star system, onboard computers update the price from signals coming from that planet(4 weeks old, 2 weeks old, week old, current). You could only show the player prices from their last visit to any known system, and a list of planets with a shortage on some cargo. Combine this with the previous signal limitation idea, and long hauls would almost always be a gamble in terms of profit. 

I'd take a moment first to outline the limitations I see with spacefaring creatures. It's hard to see any kind of mechanism that would allow this kind of evolution purely in space, just on the basis of the harshness of the environment. I see the chance of some planetoid, maybe collapsing or cracking apart, with some species surviving the apocalyptic events and as their world decays and gravity and atmosphere slowly dissipate, the pressure to adapt remains and pushes the flora and fauna to gravityless and atmosphereless space. As this kind of changes would be more of the rapid and world-ending type, small species with short spans between generations would be my choice. From this, the simple fact that space is empty and big, the organisms would benefit greatly from the longer lifespans, meaning slower and larger. But as the change from small to large would happen in space, most likely any limbs designed to bear their weight would be gone. I'm pretty sure any "realistic" means of movement go out the window with the requirement of such speeds, so I'll just give my ideas here, even though they won't match this requirement. 1. Movement Magnetic propulsion of various sorts. Currently available(realistic in that sense) include Ion thrusters, Magnetoplasmadynamic thrusters and their variants. Usually operated by pushing some form of fuel, after ionization, through an exhaust. Siphoning hydrogen off stars would be a good way to get some plasma going, though the amounts for any realistic propulsion required would be quite massive(and getting massive faster than the creature itself). And don't even think about going fast with this option. It's good for efficiency, but speeds are abysmal. From the outer-space life topic linked, the Solar sails type of creature could pretty well fit into this type of movement as well, diving close to the sun for a gulp of gaseous plasma and then flying away with sails. In large enough numbers(someone better with numbers has to do the calculations) they could basically speed up the life-cycle of Sol, consuming the hydrogen and rapidly shifting our sun to the end of its life as a red giant. "Spitballing" Clam-like accretion of a ball of space debris and accumulated dust from their travel across the void. This movement isn't very precise, nor very efficient at going exactly at a destination. Asteroid belts and planetary rings might be alluring to these creatures for just propulsion purposes. This type of movement would also act in pretty much a end-all solution for the animals needs: Capture ice for things like breathing(!!) and nutrition, use up the minerals and whatever you can't use, you'll store up and use later on as you spitball your way across the universe. A threat from clams sounds pretty silly unless there's some caveats made. They'd probably have to be large enough to swallow space stations. Perhaps the waste they spit for movement is durable enough to endure re-entry heating. That way if these creatures gather en masse to our solar system, we could see an increase in 'asteroids' hitting earth(they'd have to slow down when entering our solar system, so there'd be an initial chunk from interstellar travel, possible disruptions in the Oort cloud etc.) causing all sorts of havoc. 2. How to herd these creatures First option is just a net. Carbon nanotubes or some other good tensile strength wire, woven to a net. As there are some advances already in that area, should be pretty manageable in the futuristic space zoo too. This would also work with the 'spitballers', as long as they're rid of huge chunks prior to capture. A dyson sphere would of course create a frozen and radiation free solar system, which would make the whole system undesirable for the thruster types and they'd leave or starve just by completing one around our sun. Currently realistic options out of the way, there's always force-fields or tractor-beams. Any propulsion or solar sale kind of creature only needs the tiniest of tugs to counter their extremely slow acceleration, meaning they'd be easy to control with just some kind of radar mounted turning tractor-beam that assesses if any one of them is trying to accelerate away from their designated area and pulls it back. Force fields is just the go-to for material-free cage.
