Constant variation The entire idea of Crossfit is constantly varied workouts. (The efficacy of this as a method of improvement is disputed, but I digress.) The workout of the day ("WOD") varies from day to day, as the name implies, and there are many, many, many organizations putting out WODs. CrossFit HQ puts out the so-called mainsite WODs, which many recognize as "official" CrossFit. (Other Crossfitters dispute the centrality of these workouts, which calls into question the very definition of Crossfit, which is not settled.) Many individual Crossfit gyms ("boxes") publish their daily workouts. Here's a Crossfit website local to me. Notice they have distinct strength, skill and conditioning portions in most of their workouts. This is common but by no means universal. Benchmark WODs and standard warm-ups Crossfit HQ and individual boxes might have standard-issue warm-ups or workout formats, but there is no universal baseline Crossfit workout. Further, there are named workouts like Diane, Isabel, Murph and many more that are considered "benchmark" workouts. These are not quite the same as a baseline workout, since they are meant to measure progress (vis-a-vis Crossfit ability) over the long term. The benchmark WODs are not meant to be used daily or as a workout format generally, particularly since many of them are "chippers" or otherwise considered more brutal than most WODs. 

Roughly 55-80% of bodyweight Dick Moss has this overview on how much weight we are lifting in push-ups, "citing" an unnamed study: 

Strength, which is useful in all areas of life, including fitness for all manner of tasks Improved bone density, which is particularly important as we age Improved protective strength in the muscle, ligaments, tendons and other tissue surrounding our joints, which allows us to more safely engage in sports An independent and inverse association "with death from all causes and cancer in men, even after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness and other potential confounders" (BMJ; similar study with near-identical conclusions in JPAH). 

The exact conditioning workouts should change frequently, and don't need to include running or any other particular thing. The point is to make yourself tired without risking injury or incurring too much workout volume. For theses purposes, simple kettlebell work is great, as are running and swimming and rowing and bodyweight exercises. 

Yes, combining strength workouts with non-strength workouts will reduce the effectiveness of the strength workouts. Of course, that should be acceptable if your goal is broader than pure strength. Per Tom Kurz' Science of Sports Training, page 174: 

During a power clean you are supposed to keep your back straight and to lift it upright against the bar pulling you forward and down. Your lower and middle back is held rigid to keep the trunk stable. Your upper back retracts your shoulder blades to keep the bar close to your body, and at the end of the pull, your upper back explosively shrugs the bar upward. 

We can't debug your stride from just the information that a new callus formed. New calluses pop up sometimes. Probably it's because you switched footwear. Whether there's a problem is impossible to determine from what we know. 

How do elite judo players, Brazilian jiu-jitsu fighters, and wrestlers develop their strength? I am interested in their conditioning as well--running and the like--but primarily in resistance work. I am using this question as research for my own training goals, so my progress and training needs are not relevant. (In other words, I am not asking how I as a judo player should develop strength.) I will answer my own question, but I know my answer is incomplete. What other lifting programs have national- or world-class grapplers used? (Details such as the development, history, scheduling and success of the programs would be helpful in understanding them.) I'm interested in commentary about the efficacy of these workouts only relating to their performance in competition or first-hand experience. So if a wrestling team was doing OK, then started training kettlebells and won the Olympics, that's good to know. If a judoka won the World Championships then started training Olympic lifts and gassed at their next tournament, that's good to know. If the athlete, coach, or member of the athlete's team says something in an interview about how effective they found CrossFit for their grappling, that's relevant. Opinions about workout techniques or programs in general are less relevant to this question. 

So there are planned workouts, which the lifter tries to stick to. But if one is having an off day, volume or intensity can be reduced, down to a set minimum. Vice-versa for those days with a surfeit of testosterone and glycogen. I very much like this idea. Something like “add five pounds each workout, but if the first work set is way off, reduce 5% and continue as planned”, or “add five pounds every other workout, but if the first max rep is way off, deload by 10% and add an extra two sets” seem to work quite well. As always, however, being one’s own coach is the hardest part here, particularly when as inexperienced as myself. The way this would play out in your particular scenario depends on how bad the first set feels. If I feel totally awful in the first set, I'll sometimes go as far as reducing the weight by 15% while maintaining volume in that exercise, then calling it quits for the day. In the next workout I'll give it another shot, without moving forward to the next prescribed jump. On the other hand, if I feel pretty good, sometimes I'll only back off by 5%, or reduce the number of reps per set from 5 to 3, and otherwise complete the workout (and the workouts after) as scheduled. 

If you don't want to bounce because you don't know how, squatting with no bounce at the bottom is significantly harder, but a reasonable option. You won't be able to lift as much, so you won't get as strong, but it's still squatting. 

Joint rotations 5 minutes of running or jump rope or whatever to get your heart rate up Leg swings to the front, side and back, 3 sets of 10 swings on each direction. Don't bend your lower back. 

This is the most strength-oriented of the options. It will involve some hypertrophy and some token conditioning. Note, however, that squatting the same weight that you press and curl will not challenge your legs or back nearly as much as your shoulders and biceps.
