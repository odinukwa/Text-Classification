If you look at the nutrition value of the bar it looks like their claims are largely BS. The product has high amounts of sugar and seems to fit into the mid-to-high GI/GL bracket so won't be providing a slow intake of energy (low GI foods are associated with this). And the feeling full factor is likely to come from the 500ml of water you're drinking with it rather than the bar. 

40 km per week sounds like enough training miles to do a 1/2 marathon comfortably, but 30km doesn't. Could this just be a case of not doing enough miles of training before the main event? Or alternatively you're running too many miles the week before? The general advice is to reduce the mileage to the short-run amount during the final week, and skip your final training session, replacing it as rest. $URL$ is showing a week between each training session. Is this correct? If so that is not the recommended* way of training for long distances. It should be atleast 3 sessions per week (short, medium, long), or 4 if you're going for PBs. The long run should eventually be around 11-12 miles in the final week before the race. * Recommended being Runnersworld.com and this book 

You can't target the fat in your belly as everyone has pointed out, however you can do certain exercises that are best for fat burning. High impact aerobic exercise is better for fat burning than low impact - an example of low impact is swimming. A great high impact activity for fat burning is interval training. There's a 1001 variations on it, just Google "sprint training". Alternatively a sport like 5-aside football, tennis, basketball. You'll need to do those 2-3 times a week though to get any noticeable benefit. Here's a training routine from Men's Health a few years ago (which also re-iterated the paragraph above) 

The premise for this notion is based upon glycogen depletion. Replenishing glycogen allows the body to recover better and start working on muscle repair, however, You would need to work out for a few hours to consider that your glycogen might have been depleted. Assuming your friend is an athlete like you claim he probably trains for hours at a time and therefore does benefit from refueling. For most people there is no need to eat right away. Supplement companies will try to convince you otherwise the same way cereal companies will try to convince you breakfast is the most important meal of the day 

High intensity interval training and weight lifting are both very good protocols for insulin resistant people. Studies that point to weight lifting increasing insulin sensitivity $URL$ $URL$ HIIT effect on insulin resistance study $URL$ You can search around as there are a lot more, i just quoted a few As with all studies the only way to know if they are really true is to try them out (where there is no risk) and see for yourself 

Often enough a foam roller can accomplish what stretching cannot. I would recommend you add that into your routine 

To answer which one burns more calories, that's pretty straightforward math. Steady state cardio burns calories based upon intensity level x amount of calories per minute . In order to get that number you would need to know your heart rate during exercise and either have the hr monitor calculate the calories burnt totals for you or plug it in to a online calculator. Either way it's pretty simple. Sounds like the treadmill option is more intense and is burning more per minute however if you are doing it for less time you might be burning more with walking outside. My advice,Collect the data and run the numbers. Once you have clear which one is burning more, that still doesn't answer the question of which one is the better deal. The best exercise for you is the one you will stick to , only you can answer that question 

The evidence for post-workout protein shakes increasing your performance for running isn't conclusive, so this is somewhat anecdotal advice. I've been running for about 4 years regularly and in the past 6 months tried protein shakes after the long and mid runs. I've increased my speed from 8.1mph to 9mph in that time, and up to 9.5-10mph for 5k runs. I've also lost weight in that period from the eating less via the protein shakes, A 500ml serving keeps you sated for an hour or so later until a main meal, and is about 120 calories. The protein powder I used is by Bio-synergy, which is whey powder (basically dried milk). The cheaper stuff you get at a discount seems to be missing not only taste, but some amino acids and bulked out with soya. The one chose is also targeted at lean muscle growth rather than body building/bulking up, which helps. It's an easy and fairly cheap experiment to try, just be sure to stick with a good brand that is carb free, and avoid the soya shakes. 

4 exercises I was given by an osteopath when I had fairly chronic muscular lower back pain were all leg related: 

What weight training exercises can I do with dumbbells that will benefit me most for running 5-10ks? Are stomach crunches/sit ups worth doing too? 

The advice I was given by a professional physiotherapist was to concentrate on stride length, and landing on the back of the foot/heel (I pronate though, so this was probably foot shape specific). It may have been very generic advice and not something an Olympic champion would care about, but it helped my pace/lap time quite a lot. Squats and glute exercises are worth considering too, especially if you are increasing your mileage fairly quickly, both help if you suffer from shin-splints. 

As you probably know, resistance training is your Nr. 1 ally against age-related sarcopenia. I suggest you don't give up in weight training, which of course you haven't done yet (hence the adjective strong in your sentence). But for other readers in your situation, I would like to suggest the following tips: Work out twice a week at most Forget about working out on a M,X,F or similar schedule. Over the age of 50 you can build muscle but the optimum frequency is TWICE A WEEK (Stadler, Stubbs, and Vukovich 1997; Westcott and Guy 1996; Westcott et al. 2009) Ignore all bodybuilding routines you read about They are meant for much younger people, and most times they are designed with the aim of exhausting them and make them feel the need to buy supplements. When applied to older people they are a sure recipe for injuries. This does not mean that you cannot build muscle any more: every day a lot of people in their 70s and beyond recover from broken bones and torn tendon surgeries. In those cases, their bodies have the ability of putting on some bone and muscle mass. It is obvious that our bodies retain a certain ability to get stronger at advanced ages, but the workout patterns must change in some way. Go easy on your joints by reducing weight but lower the execution speed so that you still target your soft tissues Aged cartilage in your joints can be damaged by using too much weight. By lowering the weights you reduce that risk. But then you must focus on slow execution speed in order to trigger the growth signal within your muscles. Do smart substitutions for shoulder exercises Shoulders are a common concern above mid-age. The small and delicate rotator cuff muscles (responsible for placing the humerus head in the right position for each movement) usually have worn off or are weaken, which means that the humerus head will not be placed correctly in certain positions (specially overhead movements) and this will lead to soft tissue impingement. The coracromial ligament is often hypertrophied due to age wearing, reducing the subacromial space. This makes again certain overhead positions dangerous for the supraspinatus tendon and for the shoulder in general. Therefore, you should avoid overhead presses and work out your shoulders by avoiding lifting your humerus above horizontal: do pushups and lateral raises instead. But be careful with lateral raises: do them with thumbs pointing up in order to avoid reducing the subacromial space, and do not move your arms strictly in the same plane, but advance your hands slightly to the front, the so-called "scapular plane elevations" by physical therapists. You can be sure they give a good workout to the lateral deltoid (Reinold et al. 2007) and not only to your supraspinatus. Avoid overhead exercises in general Not only for shoulder exercises as mentioned above, but also targeting other body parts. For instance, if for any reason you insist in doing triceps isolation exercises, choose Cable Pushdown instead of Triceps Extension Pay special attention to your Rotator Cuff Slow external and internal rotations if done slowly, with light resistance and with emphasis on the eccentric movement will help your worn out rotator cuff tendons gaining health. Be very careful to include these exercises only at the end of your workouts (you don't want to exhaust those tiny but important muscles before doing the other exercises, because it is important that they assist the big exercises by positioning the humerus head correctly) and NEVER use a high resistance, because it is very easy to damage these muscles inadvertently. Avoid bench pressing, do pushups instead Avoid bench presses, where your scapulae and rear shoulder muscles are pressed against the bench, and do pushups instead. Not only they work out the same muscles, but they will contribute to your shoulder health by strengthening your shoulder girdle, serratus muscles and also by giving your core a gentle, isometric workout. If they are too easy for you, do them with a weighted vest. If they are too heavy for you, do them with your hands on a Smith machine bar whose elevation you can change in order to increase/decrease leverage. Take care of your wrists by using push up handles and pull wrist straps for pull exercises (rows and similar) Do not neglect those two accessories. Once you injure your wrists they take a very long time to heal. Do NEVER work to failure. Choose a very slow linear progression instead Start any exercise with a volume you can handle easily. Resist the urge to push through. In the next workout add no more than one rep per set. Do not change weight or leverage until you have achieved at least 15 repetition sets. This will ensure a very slow and safe progression. You may feel you are wasting time at the beginning but, as elementary logic dictates, you will sooner or later reach a training intensity that demands adaptation to your tissues, and you will have reached it slowly and safely. Take special care on your knees Unless you have been a life-long runner, choose swimming instead of running for cardio. A stationary bike is supposed to be OK too, but the ergonomics must be perfect and the progress should be carefully slow. Take your time to warm up thoroughly Do tons of shoulder circles and (empty hand) reverse flies before working out your upper body. Use the stationary bike for 8 to 10 minutes before squatting. Do not push through exercises that give you joint discomfort. Choose surrogate exercises for them, or decrease range of motion It is natural for instance that you feel joint pain at the most outstretched position of a chest fly. But by setting up the machine as to limit your range of motion, you can still work out. Avoid isolation exercises if the muscles concerned are already at work within compound movements For instance, by doing triceps isolation exercises you put your elbow joints under unnecessary stress. If you do pushups, your triceps are getting more than enough load to stimulate muscle growth and slow down or (partially) revert sarcopenia. Stay away from too many crunches and abdominal work Unless you have been doing them for years and your core is hard as iron, stay away from hard abdominal work, or you will be risking a hernia. During pushups your abs gets enough workout. Do not hold your breath at all during resistance training This may lead to dangerous blood pressure increase. STOP IMMEDIATELY IF YOU FEEL DIZZY And pay a visit to a cardiologist before engaging in sports at advanced age. 

Obviously you will be limited to bodyweight exercises. I would try to get in some basics bodyweight resistance training and some plyometric style cardio as it will help with the explosive power of your muscles. There are plenty of portable equipment options too for relatively cheap should you choose to invest such as bands which generally come with a door catch so you can work both push and pull muscles 

When you bulk you also gain fat, when you cut you also lose muscle the question simply is what is the majority. Your goal in a cut is to lose mostly fat and vice versa in a bulk. There is no way to avoid this. With proper training and eating you can guide your bulk or cut in the direction you would like it to go If you decide to cut now you will definitely lose a bit of muscle ,however if your protein intake is adequate and you are lifting weights ,it will be minimal. Many people store fat in various different areas , this is not controllable. The bottom line is, if you continue eating in a deficit you will lose it ,it will simply be a question of how lean do you personally need to be in order to lose it Some people will see abs at 15% body fat some will require to be of lesser percent it has a lot to do with the shape of your muscles,skeletal structure, and where you store fat 

$URL$ is the best of the others I've tried. It allows user data and has a decent user interface unlike the competition. It'd be nice if they could all get together and offer a single database instead of the 5-6 bad ones you get now. Another place to try is mysupermarket, for example an Apple 

I experienced quite bad stitch when I first started running, and after some casual research discovered my problem was coming from: 

The information is sort of correct, except it's supposed to be roughly a 2 hour window of increased metabolic rate after doing exercise that is primarily anaerobic. However, this doesn't mean you can eat anything you want, in fact almost the opposite - the benefit comes from eating a small snack during this period and enjoying the 'free' increased calorie burn. 

Another exercise involves using the elbow to massage the back, with a fair amount of pressure - obviously you'll need a partner/friend/willing house mate to do it though, and it hurts. 

So the easiest way to immediately stop the stitch is to leave 1.5 - 2 hours after eating before running, and slow down to a speed where you don't get stitch. Usually it was the former though, and reducing how much I ate also helped (switching to a single pita, baked potato or cereal bar). If you want to relieve it while running, bending over forward with your hands towards the floor helps to relieve it, although you do look a bit stupid running down the road doing this. A simple breathing technique can help - breath in and hold your breath for 5 seconds, then as you exhale breath in as you're exhaling. It definitely gets easier if the two reasons I gave are the cause of the stitch. If the eating timing doesn't make any difference then a trip to the doctor or physio would be best. 

I do 5x5 and IF and have no problem with recovery. If you are concerned with fatigue and CNS recovery than the answer really is it depends on how well your body recovers and how you feel. This will obviously be impacted by the type of workout you do also. So try it and see what happens. There is no right answer. If you're feeling fine and you are just concerned with muscle synthesis , there are some studies that have been done by Layne Norton to show optimal muscles synthesis takes place every 4 hrs and there is benefit in consuming protein every 4 hrs or so. However this is just a few studies not hundreds of studies, it's not set in stone and even if the conclusions are true they only claim a slight benefit nothing more . you will still make gains without it. You need to weigh out the before of IF to you over the slight improvement in muscle synthesis. If IF is what's keeping you in your diet ,it's way more important than these minute benefits 

Hyponatremia is specific to sodium not all electrolytes. Ingesting salt water or salt tablets will solve that problem. Either way you want to replenish all your electrolytes, I would advise using a pill supplement if you don't want to drink a sports drink. There are many electrolytes supplements pills available for purchase. Complex carbs or any type of carb for that matter will not replenish your electrolytes unless by some coincidence that contain those specific minerals. Your headache can be caused by way too many things to diagnose
