The main problem with the critique is that he doesn't distinguish tanha (i.e. craving or thirst) from chanda (i.e. desire, possibly wholesome desire). He therefore assumes that Buddhism is nihilist. He also didn't mention "clinging", and so on. In summary I think the critique is based on a false premise, i.e. it's a critique of his own (strawman) rendition of the four noble truths. You'd do better to study translations and commentary of the original version. Another problem with it may be the statement, "However, there are two ways to deal with desire–one way is, as Buddhism suggests, to eliminate it. The other is to actually achieve what you desire." -- I'm not sure (but I doubt) whether that's acknowledging that sankharas are impermanent and unsatisfatory. Another problem is, "How else can we be benevolent toward others other than by helping them to get the things they want or ought to want?" -- I think that's extremist, implying we might either try to satisfy everyone's every wildest dream, or care nothing for them ... instead there's a "middle way" (helping people with what they need, causing no harm, interacting harmoniously, and so on). In the end it equates Buddhism with nihilism -- but Buddhism would describe nihilism as one of the types of Wrong View. 

I don't think I'm so verbal/grammatical/linguistic when I talk to myself -- sentences (with a subject and a verb, e.g. a pronoun) are I think only when I'm talking or writing, or reading and reciting -- i.e. producing language for inter-personal communication, or replaying language. For example: 

I note that, in practice, all "Buddhist countries" too have a military -- and sometimes use them as well, sometimes infamously. Wikipedia's article Buddhists in the United States military says there's some provision for Buddhists in the US military (I was wondering whether they had any Buddhist chaplains). That article suggests that the (few) Buddhists in the army tend/tended to be of Japanese descent and/or a Japanese school of Buddhism -- IMO Buddhism in Japan is historically a little different from in other countries: with "samurais" being Buddhist, and (more recently) priests who marry, and so on. Note that as some alternative, even in WW2, the USA allowed "conscientious objectors" (often Christian pacifists) to serve as non-combatants -- so you might serve on the battle-field as a stretcher-bearer, for example, rescuing the wounded. 

Are "spacious" and "empty" words that are confused or mis-translated? Is "spacious" a word that has a use in Buddhism? A search for "spacious" on Access to Insight suggests that word is used, but is not used often and not used canonically. I think "empty" usually means "empty of self", am I right? I.e. when people say "empty" do they mean Anatta? 

Is the difference that with Buddhism you don't give up trying? I suppose one difference might be that you ought to learn from mistakes -- stop doing a "wrong" thing (or stop trying to do something in the "wrong" way), and do it "right" instead. For example, this answer includes some doctrine on how to find a marriage partner -- it includes advice both on what to avoid ("unsuitable associates" and "unproven traditional criteria"), and on what to do instead ("find wise people who cause no fear or worry"). 

And this book Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West quotes Isaac Schmidt as saying, 

I suspect it's based on Buddhism's claim that everything (or, more specifically than "everything", all "conditioned things" -- however that includes all the things which the mind perceives i.e. ideas) are imperfect: or not imperfect but, more specifically, "impermanent" and "disappointing". 

The associated story is here. I hesitate to tell this story because it seems like blaming the victim, not sympathetic. I don't want to say, "you were robbed ... and I expect you to like that!" But if the friend to whom the injustice was done now continues to hate their situation (or, it's called, aversion), if you're continuing to hold hate, then that's continuing to 'suffer', prolonging the suffering ... and that's maybe part of the types of suffering (see here and see also "not getting what is wanted is stressful") that the Buddha certainly made statements about: not injustice so much as our reaction to it. Of course he also made statements about justice; for example, 

I suppose a poor analogy might be that drinking (alcohol) isn't wholesome, but that drinking water is beneficial. There's also a sutta on the subject: Brahmana Sutta. 

The French have a word "affoler" which literally/etymologically means "to make crazy". Here are some definitions of it from the 'net: 

As for the second question, "So, my second question is, does it really matter (in terms of holding the Right View) if the mind is neurologically originated or not?" 

The overt story there is about the relative quantity. As for motive I assumed that the motive of the "many rich people" was their social status or something ... maybe pride rather than metta ... conceit. The reason why I assume that is because there's another, similar Christian message, about praying but not to publicize that you're praying: 

Forgive me for disagreeing but I though it might teach slightly the opposite: it teaches that that-which-is-experienced are your own senses, and your senses depend on your impermanent body, therefore your experience of 'form' is 'conditioned', therefore your experience is 'empty', therefore you can manifest detachment towards your experience and not suffer from your experiences ... 

It seems I don't know, don't understand, or don't agree with your definitions (of cetanā and sankappa). You start by assuming that there is wholesome and unwholesome cetanā: and then you ask whether there is wholesome and unwholesome sankappa. 

Whereas a disidentification or decentering which you quote from the 2002 paper by Teasdale seems to me, not exactly the concept of 'detachment' or of seeing impermanence, but more specifically the concept of 'anatta' or 'non-self'. For example, the article "No-self or Not-self?" suggests that any concept of self is a cause of suffering. There's a description of decentering in the Gaddula Sutta, 

On the other hand, the tigress story and the pirates story are not part of the Pali canon. Thanissaro Bhikkhu has his own version of the pirate story in this Dhamma talk: 

That answer in the video has a parallel in Sky burial where the body is exposed in the wilderness to be eaten by birds and animals. That practice is unpopular (and, more to the point, illegal) in countries which don't have enough wilderness etc. Cremation is a standard practice in India and, apparently, was the practice in the Buddha's time. The Maha-parinibbana Sutta ends with the monks telling the local society to do as they see fit (which included cremation). I think there is a "religious" aspect to it: a Christian might believe in resurrection of the body and therefore want their body buried instead of destroyed. A Buddhist is more likely to see the body as impermanent and not-self (on the other hand Buddhists do collect relics, see e.g. here and here). As for ecology I suppose that burial is more carbon-neutral, but it takes land, cemeteries run out of space. 

I searched for the word "proselytize" on accesstoinsight and found it in only two articles. One is Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi saying (talking about religion in general in the modern world, not only about Buddhism), 

So it's talking about, trying to say something about, karma. That (karma) is something which the Buddha will have talked about; however starting here from a fake quote (a mis-quote) about anger probably isn't the easiest start to explaining karma, a difficult subject. 

Is there any mention of the merits/ demrits of adoption in the Tipitika or any other Buddhist writings? It's only short, but the Zen story Is That So? features an adoption. I think it's intended to portray a wise attitude, and good parenting. 

If that were to happen, in my situation I should probably be unsure of myself: because perhaps what he says is one way in which the Yang style that he's teaching is different from the Chen style that I was taught previously. Also there are few students in our class, so we have every opportunity to ask individual questions. So if he said that we ought to 'something' and I disagreed, I could query that and ask for confirmation, "Is it meant to be like this (demonstrates this) or is it more meant to be like this (demonstrates this)?" In your case you might (if you wanted to) ask that as a more pointed question, "Is what you just said contradicted by so-and-so who wrote such-and-such?" Perhaps that's an example of a question to ask privately after class, to see whether and how the teacher is able to respond to such a question? If you're correct in claiming that he said something "wrong or misleading", then what you reply might (if what you say must be "disagreeable") belong to this category of 'right speech' defined in MN 58, i.e.: 

So if 'metta' doesn't seem to work then perhaps samatha or vipassana might. But I think you've said that you have mostly been practicing samatha, already, in the past? 

The quote above says there are "appropriate services for treatment". Do you agree whether those services exist? And whether they're appropriate? Is it your job to be/supply those services, or is it your job to suggest those services? Does your meditation on the three marks suggest ways in which those services could be improved or augmented? Is there someone (e.g. your boss and/or counsellor) with whom you can discuss whether to add to the services or solutions which are "suggested as appropriate" by the agency which employs you? Also if you want to or are able to "use personal experience" in a way that not appropriate for your job, there are vehicles for doing that outside the scope of your employment -- I'm thinking that AA / Al-Anon or NA / Nar-Anon meetings, for example, centre around people recounting their personal experience and insight for the benefit of others. 

I have't watched the "ode to envy" you referenced in the OP. If you want to find something good/complimentary/encouraging to say about envy, if you want to say how it's constructive, perhaps there's an example of that in Bhikkhuni Sutta: The Nun, 

In that context I think that a sign is your first impression of something, and its details are what you discern afterwards if you then focus on that thing. When you get a first impression of something the (unmindful or "unreleased") consciousness will "follow" the sign. 

In contrast to that, if you read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (or the Pali suttas) it categorizes things as good and not-good ... "things" including feelings, and views, and intentions. So one of the differences between Buddhism and this article, IMO, is that Buddhism discusses what's good and not-good ... which this article doesn't, at all. Instead this article tries to discuss what's true and not-true, what's real and not-real (but the article doesn't succeed, and/or isn't useful). Also I think that if Buddhism talks about "illusion" (and I'm not sure that it does), that illusion doesn't consist of failure to perceive reality, instead it's failure to assign the proper value to perception: e.g. the illusion is perceiving something that's unpleasant as pleasant, perceive something that's impermanent as everlasting, perceive something that's not-self as self, etc. I'm really not sure what Buddhism says about "illusion": but it might be a more accurate or a more common translation to say that Buddhism talks about "ignorance", and that "ignorance" is a cause of "wrong view" (as opposed to "right view").
