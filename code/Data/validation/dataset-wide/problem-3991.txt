You might like looking at Eisenbud, Green and Harris "Cayley-Bacharach theorems and conjectures". They start with classical theorems of Euclidean geometry, such as Pappus and Pascal's theorem, and relate them to questions in commutative algebra regarding in what degree the saturated homogenous ideals of various sets in $\mathbb{P}^2$ are generated. This is to say, they relate them to describing the $0$-syzygies of the ideal. CM-regularity is a measure of the complexity of all syzygies. If you more specifically want to know why people historically studied higher syzygies, I've heard good things about Eisenbud's "Geometry of syzygies", although I haven't read it. 

Here is the most algebraic way I can see to compute this. Let $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ be two quadratic polynomials in four variables. Let $R$ be the graded ring $k[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4]/(Q_1, Q_2)$. Let $V_d$ be the vector space of degree $d$ polynomials in $(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)$, and let $R$ be the degree $d$ part of $R$. We have an exact sequence: $$0\to V_{d-4} \to V_{d-2}^{\oplus 2} \to V_d \to R_d \to 0.$$ The first (nontrivial) map is $f \mapsto (f Q_2, - f Q_1)$, the second is $(g,h) \mapsto g Q_1 + h Q_2$, the third is the degree $d$ part of the quotient map $k[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4] \to R$. So $$\dim R_d = \dim V_d - 2 \dim V_{d-2} + \dim V_{d-4} =$$ $$\frac{(d+3)(d+2)(d+1)}{6} - 2 \frac{(d+1)(d)(d-1)}{6} + \frac{(d-1)(d-2)(d-3)}{6} = 4d$$ for $d>0$. (For $d=0$, this computation fails because $\dim V_{-4}$ is $0$, not $(-4+3)(-4+2)(-4+1)/6=-1$.) Let $X$ be the curve $Q_1 = Q_2 = 0$, and let $L$ be the line bundle on $X$ gotten by restricting the line bundle $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on $\mathbb{P}^3$. For sufficiently large $d$, we have $R_d = H^0(X, L^{\otimes d})$. So, for large $d$, we have $\dim H^0(X, L^{\otimes d}) = 4d$. By Riemman-Roch, this dimension should be $(\deg L)d - (\mathrm{genus}(X)-1)$. So $\deg L=4$, and $X$ has genus $1$. 

The full title of the translation appears to be "Almost independence of random variables and the capacity of a secrecy channel" and it appeared in Problems of Information Transmission 32 (1996), no. 1, 40â€“47. (Found by searching MathSciNet for author=Csiszar, title=capacity. Here is the review.) Problems of Information Translation's online archive only appears to go back to 2001 and googling variants of the title doesn't turn up any copies, so the next step is to get out of your chair and walk to the library. For example, Michigan's library has all the back issues of Problems of Information Transmission. This answer assumes you are a student at an institution which pays for access to academic databases and has a good library. I do realize that not everyone on this site has these privileges, but I think most of us do, and those of us who do should know how to use them. 

I don't know any results like Sturm's theorem, which give a precise simple formula for the number of roots. I have always thought of the analogue of Descartes' rule of signs as Khovanskii's theorem. This states 

Well, there is certainly a bound of that form. Here is a crude proof: There is an exponential map from skew-symmetric matrices to O(n). This is differentiable with nonsingular Jacobian near the origin. The preimage of the delta ball, if I understand your notations, is the log(1+delta) ball. So the volume of this preimage is c(n)*log(1+delta)^{n(n-1)/2} where c(n) is the volume of the unit ball. Now just multiply by some lower bound for the Jacobian near 0. By the way, do you want to insist on using the sup norm? A lot of these formulas are nicer for the L^2 norm. For example, I think the preimage in the skew symmetric matrices is an ordinary ball, so its volume would be well known. 

There are very few results which allow us to know that a mathematical claim will be provable or disprovable within ZFC without actually proving or disproving it. To the best of my knowledge, the only exceptions are theories which have quantifier elimination. Few1 open mathematical problems which people are interested in are of this sort, and none of the Millenium problems are. So any of the Millenium problems could be independent of ZFC (except for the Poincare conjecture, because it has been proved!) You might be particularly interested in Scott Aaronson's survey on whether or not it is likely that $P \neq NP$ is independent of ZFC. 1 Here is an example of a question which I know is decidable in ZFC, yet whether the answer is "yes" or "no" is open. 

Yes, it is true. Let $G \cong \mathbb{Z}/m$ act by $\mathrm{diag}(\zeta^{a_1}, \zeta^{a_2}, \ldots, \zeta^{a_n})$, where $\zeta$ is a primitive $n$-th root of unity. Let $S$ be the semigroup $\{ (b_1, \ldots, b_n) \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}^n : \sum a_i b_i \equiv 0 \mod m \}$. Then the quotient is Spec of the semigroup ring $\mathbb{C}[S]$. Since the semigroup is torsion free, finitely generated and saturated, the corresponding Spec is an affine toric variety. 

Let $\Omega^{p,q}(M)$ be the $C^{\infty}$ $(p,q)$-forms. One always has a double complex with $\Omega^{p,q}(M)$ in position $(p,q)$. The cohomology in the $q$ direction is Dolbeault cohomology, the cohomology of the total complex is deRham cohomology. (In each case, essentially by definition.) Whenever you have a double complex, you get a spectral sequence. On the first page of the spectral sequence is Dolbeault cohomology; the spectral sequence converges to deRham cohomology. This is sometimes called the Hodge-de Rham spectral sequence, and sometimes called the Frolicher spectral sequence. If $M$ is compact Kahler (in particular projective) then the spectral sequence collapses at the first page; all maps between Dolbeault groups are zero. So $H^k(M) \cong \bigoplus_{p+q=k} H^{p,q}(M)$ in this case. If $M$ is Stein (in particular, affine) then the only nonzero Dolbeault groups are the $H^{p,0}(M)$, corresponding to holmorphic $p$-forms. The next page takes the cohomology of the complex of holomorphic $p$-forms; I'll term this ``holomorphic deRham". After that, there are no further maps, so holomorphic deRham equals deRham. In general, the spectral sequence can be arbitrarily nondegenerate. 

A characteristic zero example: Let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero (or anything not $2$.) Let $L$ be the field $k(x,y)$ and let $K$ be the subfield $k(x^2, xy, y^2)$, so $[L:K]=2$. Let $S \subset L$ be the ring $k[x,y]$, and let $R = S \cap K = k[x^2, xy, y^2]$. Then $S$ is the normalization of $R$ in $L$. I claim that $\mathrm{Spec} \ k[x,y] \to \mathrm{Spec} \ k[x^2, xy, y^2]$ is not flat. Proof: the map is generically $2 \to 1$. However, the fiber above the origin is $k[x,y] /(x^2, xy, y^2)$, which has length $3$. 

ADDED I've been thinking more about this, and I am no longer so optimistic, although I'd still love to know what an expert thinks. Quillen associates a restricted Lie algebra $L_i$ to a $p$-group $G_i$. Writing $U_i$ for the restricted enveloping algebra, he shows that the associated graded of $\FF_p[G_i]$ with respect to $I_i$ (the augmentation ideal) is $U_i$. In our case, we get $\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \otimes L_1 \cong \mathbb{F}_{p^2} \otimes L_2$ and so $\mathbb{F}_{p^2} \otimes U_1 \cong \mathbb{F}_{p^2} \otimes U_2$. Now, can we lift this back to $\FF_{p^2}[G_1] \cong \FF_{p^2}[G_2]$? The most obvious reason this should be true is if $U \cong \FF_p[G]$ as algebras. That's true if $G$ is an abelian $p$-group. I think it is also true for the noncommutative $p$-torsion group of order $p^3$. But I don't think it should be true in our case. More generally, let's talk about $2$-step $p$-torsion nilpotents in general. So, let $G$ be the group generated by $X_i$ and $Z_{ij}$ with the relations that everything is $p$-torsion, the $Z_{ij}$ are central, $Z_{ij} = Z_{ji}^{-1}$ and $X_i X_j = X_j X_i Z_{ij}$. We might, in addition, impose some further commutative relations between the $Z_{ij}$. (In our example, $X_i$ runs from $i=1$ to $4$, and the $Z_{ij}$ generate a group of rank $2$.) Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the corresponding restricted Lie algebra on $x_i$ and $z_{ij}$, where all $[p]$-powers are $0$, the $z_{ij}$ are central, $z_{ij} = - z_{ji}$ and $[x_i, x_j] = z_{ij}$. We'd like to know whether there is an isomorphism $\FF_p[G] \to \FF_p\langle \mathfrak{g} \rangle$, where the right hand side is the restricted enveloping algebra. Let $A$ be the subring $k[z_{ij}]/z^{ij}^p=0$ of the right hand side. We want the $Z_{ij}$ to go to central elements on the right, so it seems plausible that the $Z_{ij}$ should map into $A^{\times}$. For low degree terms in the $x_i$, we should clearly send $X_i$ to the initial terms of $\sum_s x_i^s/s!$. But this runs into trouble in degree $p$. Suppose we try fixing this by writing $X_i = \sum_{s<p} x_i^s/s! + Y_i$ where $Y_i$ appears in degrees $\geq p$. Then there are about $4 \dim k \langle \mathfrak{g} \rangle$ coefficients in $Y_i$. The condition that $X_i X_j X_i^{-1} X_j^{-1}$ lies in $A^{\times}$ is about $6 \dim k \langle \mathfrak{g} \rangle$ conditions. So we have more conditions then variables, I don't think a naive deformation approach will solve the problem.
