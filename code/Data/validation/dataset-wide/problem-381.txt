Based on this truth a good answer could simply be "why not". However, to provide some logical development of this would require something like: For a specie, separated and isolated by large geographic boundaries (obviously not capable of sharing cultural norms), to collectively have a "fear" requires select evolutional conditions. In humans, certain fears like fear of the dark or a more rudimentary fear like fear of the unknown could indeed be attributed to our evolution. Back when we were still swinging from trees, things were often waiting in the dark to eat us so the need to be fearful and cautious of the dark became an evolutional necessity to reduce the chances of us being eaten. With that mechanic in mind: It could be that in the evolution of your specie something specific to member corpses posed an immediate survival concern. Perhaps the odor released from their carcass attracted a prolific predator. Perhaps an enhanced version of a disease like cholera develops rapidly in corpses and kills rapidly when exposed (enough for one to easily conclude they got lethally sick from the corpse). Perhaps decomposition is so rapid that within days the corpse could explode with microbes and charion insects (I sure as hell would want to burn the dead ASAP if that happened). As your specie evolved it could then lose these physical constraints but not their generated phobia. 

Here are the issues you need to navigate: What is the extent of "Recover"? What is the event? Answering these drastically changes any answer If recover means plants and animals exist then it can be anywhere from a few months to a few millenia depending on the disaster. If recover means human habitable the answer could be never. As a specie we depend on certain food sources to survive. If there are no edible plants or animals we cant survive. If the cataclysm wipes out all of them and no new ones evolve to replace them or we dont save any then we are toast. As for the cataclysm itself: if its a simple meteor that blots out the sun for a year then you could see recovery within a year. If its a big enough meteor to cause a whole plate to flood with lava like what they think is what caused the permian mass extinction, then it could be thousands of years. There are also plenty of man made disasters that could be a killer each with different variables. --UPDATE-- If the scenario is a nuclear war: What usually is considered the planet killer is the immense amount of debris and fallout blotting out the sun. Some projections believe this would last for about a year but could be longer depending on how much of the surface is blasted. (if 10% of species survived then it wasn't a total firestorm) After this period of time you would begin to see recovery as photosynthetic organisms can again begin to live. The radiation is a definite prolonger of this recovery however not an inhibitor. Plenty of plants can survive high levels of radiation. Even chernobyl is covered in plant life now. Animalian life is tricky, some organisms are more resilient than others. This would definitely affect evolution as more resilient creatures would thrive. 

Mythologically, Spirits of divine justice(Daemons), these have traditionally been construed as demons however more accurately they are beings whose purpose is to dispatch divine justice. In this case a deserving individual would be protected by his spiritual guide. Technically they aren't evil, they do as divine judgment has decreed which generally is punishment. Note: the definition of Daemon shifts variably between its Hellenistic origin and its Christian adoption. this is a good starting point on Daemons though seems to only focus on the Hellenistic interpretation. 

your tree needs to consume roughly 30 times what an acre of rainforest can process not even absorb. (bare in mind I intentionally generalized some numbers in there like 100 day years) 

I think any man willing to cut his own **** off for the sake of magic has proven far more commitment and dedication to the religion than any woman has in this society. It would likely be that such individuals would inevitably rise to be spiritual leaders. Sure the society is matriarchally led (like as the nobility) but that doesn't necessarily have to be the same case for the religious leaders. As mentioned by the OP the religion clearly expresses equivalence in gender before the gods. The nobility would likely not be threatened by such leaders as they wouldn't be able to reproduce and as such not be able to usurp any dynastic lineages. Also, since they have in effect publically removed themselves of what mostly qualifies an individual as a man these eunuchs could very likely escape any social prejudices that affect men. The likely conflict would be between female spiritual leaders not wanting to share or relinquish power to eunuch spiritual leaders. But it would be very hard for them to fight the argument of "what have you sacrificed for your god?". 

No this isnt Have you ever watched a pot of water boil, same concept. Because water vapor is less dense than water you will never have a vapor layer over the rock layer. The water will quickly drop around the vapor as it rises causing those bubbles you see in a pot. Furthermore the pressure of the ocean would be forcing the water down faster. (For you more science inclined please excuse my simplification of this process) Could it ever be hot enough to create a vapor layer? No, because you wanted the surface to be placid you need the bubbles to cool and condense before they reach the surface. The heat required to generate a vapor layer would undoubtedly boil the whole ocean. Is this scenario otherwise plausible? yes sure, ignoring the vapor layer even our own ocean has under sea vents and volcanoes where water is boiled and cooled before it reaches the surface 

Tactically, no they aren't 1) If you are focusing in on produced sound you inherently require your target to make loud enough identifying sound (which they may dampen) and you are relying on your target not to employ deceptive sounds (which they could easily make). 2) if you are doing true echolocation and emitting a sound pulse in order to locate a target based on received responses you have just revealed your location. This inherently botches loads of ground tactics requiring surprise like sniping. Even submarines don't constantly emit pulses and just sit and wait. Furthermore what if your opponent is static and geometrically blended into the landscape, you have given him your position without knowing his thus you are likely to be disadvantaged. 3) The apparatus needed to do this would certainly be unwieldy with the distance and level of detail needed to be operationally effective. In short, this would be useful against an enemy who couldn't counter it. But because it is easily countered it is in short tactically detrimental. At most it would see more usage in defensive facilities. 

I only suggest this next thought because it would be such a proper, fun even, way to really collaboratively attack building a world. Now if you want a real approach to collaboratively building a world. You can repurpose an agile tool like JIRA, plot your high level target world ideals as epics and pose research questions as stories that you pass off to willing team mates that link to a google doc where the answer is built. This way you organize and distribute your world building in a trackable way. providing this kind of structure would actually stimulate and focus collaborative effort. The down side is if you are unfamiliar with agile and agile tools this would be a pain in the ass to figure out. 

So no answer can be "in universe" or this question should be closed as that is purely the problem of the universes creator. Aside from that, One mythological look at magic, particularly fairy lore poses the notion that processed iron can hurt/trap/dispel fairies. There isn't ever an explanation for this however I always viewed it as: 

I believe that any significant change to a planets gravity as described by the OP would inherently result in a destabilizing orbit (which eventually means crashing or flying off somewhere). That being said I'm going to play with the fringes of physics. I propose your planet orbits a blackhole that periodically produces Gravitational waves, which I think if you are close enough to the source would have a perceivable effect on gravity. As we have learned from the science of Interstellar its possible to have a habitable world near a blackhole. This is sort of handwavium answer because gravitational waves and their effects aren't fully understood let alone what would be the conditions needed to have the right balance of not getting ripped to pieces while receiving enough em radiation to support life. 

Fairly unpredictable, A moon that close would likely be tearing the Earth's atmosphere away let alone causing extreme geological stress. Likely the Earth would be a heaping mass of lava with all surface water vaporized and dispersed into the atmosphere now shared with the moon and vulnerable to be dispersed by solar winds. I would think there would be a good chance for a tidal lock to form causing a great big volcano to appear. 

If you are thinking dredging operations then why not take the small extra step of robotic maintainers. They will handle the dredging an mountain building. Anyways my actual idea in addition to that Recreate the subduction process. Create low points in your water bodies such that material inevitably flows there. Then create an artificial lava tube/smelting pipe that collects and melts that material into lava. Then that pipes the lava over to an artificial volcano. Granted this does nothing for non volcanic mountains but it does result in mountains. The volcanic process can be easily controlled to not be too destructive while building up the mountain. Plants are also a great erosion controller, their roots can lock soil into place preventing soil erosion. 

As for difficulties of telepathy with EM communication A Hive mind does not mean a singular controller. If anything it's more akin to a pure democracy without all the arguing and protracted debates. Say your species occupies two worlds. So what would likely occur is the hive mind would delegate decision making to clusters based on communication lag. So if your species occupies 2 worlds there would essentially be 2 hive minds responsible for the independent governance of that world. Decisions on what the species as a whole would do would occur between those two minds. The Borg from Star Trek was a great example of this. The more isolated and smaller a group of its members became, the more independent their decision making became. 

Many of the mechanics used by insects do not scale well to larger organisms. A great deal of their abilities are only achievable because of their size with those constructs. If you scaled an ant to the size of a human, it would no longer be able to lift 10x its body weight. 

Prioritize your shipping and stagger delivery times Not everything needs to make port ASAP (though it does help commerce). Prioritize and consolidate cargo ships carrying cargo with similar expiration times. Use your laser such that ships acceleration times are proportional to their to prioritization. The math for this becomes incredibly more complicated but possible. For instance your passenger ship would take the direct most route receiving more acceleration bursts such that its flight time is 1 period. A ship carrying recreational equipment could be launched on a different trajectory and accelerated with less attention such that its total flight time could be 50 periods or more. This way you eventually result in a fairly constant stream of ships. 

Here is the massive physics problem with Charybdis Where does the water go? and how can it move enough water to make a vortex? One thought would be it has a big stomach that its pumping water out of till it opens its mouth sucking in everything above. This has a ton of problems like how does it remain submerged with such a huge bubble, how can it resist the pressure of the ocean around it trying to collapse its bubble. The sheer forces here stretch thin the limits of biologic possibility. Not to mention the energy needed to pump all that water out and create a bubble. My thought which sounds more plausible to me is that its more like a giant worm/snake/tube. Instead of creating a bubble and resisting all those pressures perhaps it works more like an intestine. Using its muscles to constrict force water from one end to another. That way the pressure inside and out are relatively the same. It would need to be long, many times longer than it is wide. Its skin would be thick to house the muscles necessary to constrict and expand. It length would also be dependent on how its able to digest what its sucked in. Also, I don't think it would poop per say. I think its back end would be an open hole constantly excreting water similar in diameter to its mouth. As a fun thought, it could be that it doesn't intentionally pray upon ships and large fish. It could be a large filter feeder primarily trying to eat algae and plankton and just so happens to get other creatures by chance. The jagged rocks described at its mouth could be teeth and it could have teeth like structures lining the first part of its inner body to break up large debris entering it. Its lower body would probably have more mesh like structures to more easily extract nutrients. A Pyrosome is semi relevant in that they are big floating tubes that can suck in water filter it and push it out. 

I misspelled "feed" with "feen" oops. regardless you are using the energy of the water run off from the mountains to drive the current of the river. 

Potentially Forever In software, usually the simplest methodology survives and is built upon perpetually. I know that is going to spark some debate but there are plenty of cases where its true like the prolific usage of HTTP. In all likelihood what is more likely to change isn't the communication protocols but the applications built to understand and utilize them. In your case a 1st generation starship might require a Com officer who can talk to other ships through a Command line Interface, while a 5th generation starship might have an app that a captain can simply talk to vocally to auto communicate with other ships. Likely, 5th generation captain (lacking the technical skills) would be at a loss trying to figure out how to interface with that assuming the app wasn't designed with backward compatibility. However, if there was a programmer on the 5th gen ship, it is possible he could easily create some bridge. This is most likely to occur in commercial ships who would prefer to cut costs through automation and reduction of necessary skilled labor. A military ship would likely have someone technically competent enough to figure out the bridging. Because of the likely technical sophistication of a starship and the already significant emergence of cyber warfare it is highly likely military starships would have multiple tech savvy crew members. There is another factor which is the physical method they communicate over. A commercial freighter may adopt a cheaper faster physical communication apparatus that the 1st gen doesn't have and remove all other provided no regulation interfered with that (Laws may require all ships to keep RF receivers for standardized communication). So its possible two different generation commercial vessels couldn't physically communicate with each other. A military vessel would like contain every communication apparatus simply for Signals Intelligence.
