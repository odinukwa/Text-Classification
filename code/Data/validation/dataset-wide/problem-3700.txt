I had a very similar problem when I was getting ready for my first bodybuilding competition, I know exactly what you mean. So you're around 185lbs with 12-14% body fat (which is very good, nice job). To get to even lower body fat levels, it will be hard work, but it is definitely doable. The main factor when you get to this point is fine tuning your diet in an exact manner. Not eating junk, sugar, etc will definitely get you lean but after a certain point, it's just not enough, your body has adapted to your caloric intake and will not metabolize any more fat as a "survival" mechanism. I will give you a few tips on how to overcome this. I can help you further if you comment back with your current diet as well. Also I'm assuming that you have your training down relatively OK. 

If you've been following the same diet for all this time, it's very likely that your body has adapted and your metabolism has slowed down to cope with this. I won't give too many details here, but first of all, if you're trying to lose weight, the only times I would eat carbs would be right when you wake up, and before and after your workouts. The 2 cup white rice for dinner might have worked at first, but you're consuming a high glycemic carbohydrate with a decent amount of fat and protein, once your metabolism slowed down, its likely that this is either enough to fill up your glycogen stores and hence make u gain water weight, or just be stored as fat. I would try to carb cycle if I were you since your body will not really adapt to this diet as you're constantly changing it up. I.e eat high carbs 1-2 times a week when youre going to go VERY hard at the gym, eat medium carbs 2-4 times a week, and low carbs on the days that you don't workout. Furthermore, I would add in a cheat day every 2 weeks or so, in order to reduce your cortisol levels, and spike your metabolic rate up, basically shocking the body. It seems that you barely eat in the morning, and hence this will definitely make your metabolic rate go down over time. Try to get the bulk of your calories from morning to after your workout. 

As JJosaur pointed out, this meal is around 520 calories. However, this number is utterly useless unless we know more about you. What do you weigh, do you exercise? if so, what do you do? how often? how old are you, how much sleep do you get? you get the point. Although he mentions that you should eat protein, which you definitely should if your goal is muscle gain, you won't actually gain much of anything unless you break down the muscles through exercise to gain weight. I'll make it very simple though, in order to gain weight, you must consume more calories than you burn off. Everyone burns a certain amount of calories via their resting metabolic rate, which is around 14-15x your bodyweight in lbs, i.e if you weighed 180lbs, you would burn 2500-2700 calories a day just to get your body to function. Hence, your meals throughout the day must not only reach this amount of calories, but they must SURPASS them in order to gain weight on a regular basis. This means you would need to eat 3000-35000 calories if you weigh 180lbs, daily, over a certain period of time, in order to gain any weight at all. Now, the macros that comprise your foods will have an impact on how your body looks, i.e 90% of your calories coming from carbs and fats won't make you the most muscular guy in the world, but you will still gain weight. Ideally, you'd want to lift weights regularly (at least 2-3x a week), and get over 30% of your calories from protein, and the rest can vary depending on your lifestyle, if you want to gain weight via as much muscle as possible. 

What are the mechanisms that must be present in order for me to gain lean muscle mass (purely from a training perspective)? 

What exactly do you mean by "wise"? It has its ups and downs depending on what your goals are. If your goal is weight/fat loss then yes it is fine. You will burn through your glycogen stores via weights and most of the calories you burn via cardio will have to come from fat. If your goal is strength, it's not the best. It's been shown that there is a linear interference between strength gains and cardio. Simply put, the more LOW INTENSITY cardio that you do, the more strength you will sacrifice (within reasonable limits). Hence why you will never see a powerlifter jog on a treadmill. If the cardio is high intensity, then I don't see a problem. If your goal is to build muscle, then mixing in cardio will take away from the intensity of the workout, i.e you won't be able to give training your muscles 100% the intensity and concentration that you need. Alternative: do the cardio after your workout is done, or not at all, if your goal is muscle building (assuming your diet is proper). If your goal is to just be "fit", then yes it's fine absolutely. 

There is absolutely no calculator or formula that can give you a 100% accurate figure of your actual RMR. It depends on way too many factors and some of these factors aren't even understood. People have varying metabolisms, muscle mass, BMI, activity levels, environmental stress factors, external stress factors, recovery rates, genetic conditions...hence why you get different numbers from different calculators...it's almost like an insurance premium. That being said, as you can clearly see, the numbers you listed are relatively close to each other and really...that's all you need. A deficit/surplus of 12.86 calories isn't going to do much of anything, specially because this stuff matters more in the long run. If you're trying to get leaner, I would say the absolute best RMR estimation is the one I've seen from Tnation and Layne Norton, it's worked for them and it works for me. You weight 181lbs => 181x14 = 2534 cals roughly. Now, if you wanna lose half a lbs of fat a week, then you would do (-500/600) and get around 1900-2050 ish calories. So eat anywhere between 1900-2100 calories a day in order to lose weight at a good rate. I would always suggest starting at the highest range possible since drastically reducing calories is a sure way to slow down your metabolism and is unrealistic in the first place. So to sum up, the calculators are all just estimations to narrow down your approximate rate. Noone except yourself can know your true metabolic rate and you actually won't until you start experimenting a bit. Which is realistically the whole goal of fitness...to learn more about your body and improve it. Start at about 2100-2200 calories a day, do this for a week or two and see if you're losing any weight, if not then reduce by another 100. When you do lose the weight, you know that the previous caloric intake goal was your maintenance rate. 

Your goals are losing fat and improving stamina. Let's break each one down. To lose fat, you must be in a caloric deficit (burn more calories than you eat). The usual way to this would be to ballpark your resting metabolic rate (RMR) and consume 500/600 calories less than this and see if you make progress, and adjust accordingly. You would want to eat the majority of your carbohydrates around your workouts so you're less likely to store them as glycogen and eventually fat, to make this fat loss process easier. You'd also want to consume at least a gram of protein per lbs of bodyweight in order to minimize muscle loss, so that your metabolism doesn't go down even further. It is a myth that it is the workout itself that does the fat burning, that's not true. It's the caloric deficit. The workout just helps increase metabolism via muscle mass and activity levels. HOWEVER, you say you have hypothyroidism, so your metabolism isn't like the general public. I don't know the extent of this in your case, but if it is VERY noticeable and is affecting you, then talk to your doctor about some medicines that can help with this. While very dangerous, talk to your doctor about Clenbuterol and Cytomel T3, both have the potential to increase your metabolism but are very dangerous if not used properly so MAKE SURE you talk to a doctor. If it is not that bad, the easiest and most effective way to increase your metabolism would be to increase muscle mass. Start weight training at least 3x a week with proper sleep and lots of food to add 5-15 lbs of muscle to kickstart your metabolism, you can lose the fat later when your metabolism is normal. So for fat loss, just experiment with a few calorie goals, and stick to the one that you make progress with, then decrease over time. It's hard to determine this number since your RMR is affected by your condition. Just experiment. To improve stamina (going to assume cardiovascular), you need to just work on it. There's no secret to this, if you want to get better at something, you just do it, do it often, do it well, and do it again. One key to this however that most people forget, don't get comfortable! If you get comfortable you're no longer making progress and thus aren't "improving" anything. For example, if you can do a 30 min walk right now without problem, either time your walks and try to get a faster time each time, or walk for longer. Your body adapts quickly so always strive to progress. Don't be shy to add in other cardiocascular activities as well, maybe join a recreational sports club, start biking, running, anything you want, it doesn't have to be something you hate, just pick somethings and look to always improve upon it. It is also very well documented that natural bodybuilding is amazing for cardivascular health, so do some more research into working out on your own on the internet and work out with intensity, always trying to beat your previous self. The key to both of these goals however is just consistency. You won't see any results over night, you need to be patient and just put the work in. Let me know if you have any other concerns. 

This isn't the question that you should ask yourself. Ketogenic diet has its benefits and downsides. It's hard to follow but will give you results. However, if you care about your gym performance, it is not the best. If you really care about fat loss, keto works...no questions about it. The amount of fat is obviously really high since that's the definition of keto but assuming you get your fats from healthy sources like eggs and avacado it's fine. 

When you look at building more lean muscle mass you must remember the fundamental rules of hypertrophy, which I feel is sometimes forgotten among everything else going on within your training program. There are 3 really key fundamentals which all go towards building muscle: Increased Tension To illicit a hypertrophic response you need to stimulate the muscle as much as possible, which basically means forcing as much stress via tension as possible with each rep. This is why slowing your rep tempo down builds muscle effectively, because it immediately increases the stress and tension. The reason this works is because added stress and tension equates to more "NEED" from the muscle, which equates to increased involvement from high threshold motor units (HTMUs). Exciting these motor units is the fastest way to stimulate more muscle fibres which ultimately equates to global muscle breakdown and hypertrophy. Progressive Overload Progressive overload is another key principle of accelerating your rate of hypertrophy, which basically means that over a period of time you introduce extra stress via more weight, more reps or more time under tension. Something which equates to creating an environment where your muscle has NEVER had to deal with these stress levels before. Planned Periodisation Periodisation is something which I feel the majority of the gym community fail to utilise which is why they end up plateauing and failing to break past it. It isn't enough to just go into the gym each week and train hard, there needs to be a methodical approach in place to avoid plateaus from setting in. For instance, different training volumes and rep ranges will illicit a different response and stress on your CNS (central nervous system) which means that by rotating these each week you can avoid plateaus. As a direct result of this you're able to continue growing faster, which makes your training more productive. Ultimately continuously creating hypertrophy is about understanding the science behind building muscle and knowing how to manipulate these in a positive way. Note that this is purely from a training perspective and diet isn't mentioned although it is a crucial and very large topic. Source: Neil Hill, and lots and lots of research from various journals. 

You're forgetting something VERY important here. As an example, consider this, if someone starts to workout their arms using 20lbs dumbbells (with no previous experience), they will eventually get stronger and the 20lbs will be easier than they were before right? So, now what if that person kept lifting 20lbs even after they got stronger? Do you think they're going to keep getting stronger? If that was the case, why would the gym need a bunch of dumbbells ranging from 10 to 200lbs, if you could just not change things up and progress? Do you get what I'm saying here? You must understand that the human body is incredible at adapting. If, for example, you burn X amount of calories by walking 5 miles per day, your body will adapt. It will make its energy pathways more efficient and you will burn less than the X amount of calories that you used to burn, your body loves trying to save energy (hence why it stores extra as fat or glycogen). Same goes for any other physical activity you do, you MUST progress, either walk faster, longer, or more often. Now that we got the most fundamental point down, there's still a lot of reason that can cause your situation, and I will outline the most common/reasonable explanations. Also I have no idea why you're adding 600 calories to your RMR, you should be subtracting it. If you're not losing weight with the amount of calories you're eating, its very simple...just reduce the calories. You say you want to lose weight in the healthiest way possible but you also say you don't lift weights. This is almost a contradiction. If you don't lift weights, when you do actually lose the weight, you will undoubtedly lose muscle as well (even if the majority of the weight was fat). If you lose muscle, you lower your metabolic rate. If you lower your metabolic rate, you now need to consume even less calories than before in order to lose weight. So if you needed 2000 (your RMR - 500 for example) calories a day to lose weight, and didn't weight train, and then you lost 5 lbs (3 lbs fat 2 lbs muscle). And after this, you STILL consumed the same amount of calories, you are now going over your maintenance calorie levels since you dropped your RMR by losing muscle, and hence you will actually gain weight! And since you don't weight train, you definitely didn't gain muscle, and now its gonna be even harder to lose this weight since your RMR is dropped! Do you see the contradiction now? Nevertheless, you can still lose weight in a healthy way without weight training, it will just be a lot harder and not the "healthiest" way possible. Your apetite increasing in the last few months can be explained by leptin.You eat below maintenance calories over a period of days or weeks. Your fat cells shrink as you diet, not eat, etc., and fat cells release less leptin. Your brain senses that leptin levels are low, and that you are no longer "fueled up." The hypothalamus senses the decrease in leptin levels, lowering metabolic rate and decreasing energy expenditure. It also sends a "hungry" signal, increasing appetite and encouraging you to eat. Leptin action isn't confined to just the hypothalamus. There are leptin receptors all over the body. This allows leptin to precisely coordinate appetite, metabolism, and energy expenditure.This is nature at its finest. Your body is programmed to survive. To combat this, it's actually not a bad idea to have "refeed" days. This would be a day (every two weeks or something) where you eat above your maintenance level calories in order to shock your body, so it doesn't adapt to lower calories and stall your progress. Moreover, the sources of your calories matter. The less protein you eat, the more you risk muscle loss and hence lowering your metabolic rate which will make losing weight harder and even cause weight gain. The types of carbs you eat also matter. For example, if the majority of your carb sources are high-glycemic foods such as white rice, white bread, cereal, pasta, fries...etc, then you will over time build up insulin and leptin resistance (remember leptin is key). Insulin resistance will make it so that you can't utilize future carbs effectively for fuel and make you store them as fat easier. While leptin resistance will increase your apetite without you actually needing more calories. Now, sorry I went on a huge squeal about this stuff, I just saw your real 3 questions, but luckily they're easy to answer.
