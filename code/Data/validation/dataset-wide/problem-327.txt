This is more of an issue of motivation and water than it is of technology. This could be done, if there was a reason to do it. However, lunar water would be a huge plus which would make a great difference to the project. Water would be used for many things. PROPELLANT The dV to lift a payload into low Earth orbit is 9.3-10km/s. Assuming an exhaust velocity of 4.4km/s (typical for H2-O2 engines in a vacuum, rather high for a first stage but we'll stick with it for consistency) the initial mass / payload ratio from the rocket equation is e^(10/4.4)=9.7:1 That is, a 970 tonne rocket (including hydrogen/oxygen propellant) can lift 100 tonnes into orbit. Note that "payload" here is used in the loosest possible terms, as it includes all the mass of the rocket tanks and engine, in additional to the useful payload (though infinite staging would reduce this to zero.) A real rocket necesarily underperforms this. Taking Falcon Heavy (2 1/2 stage rocket using kerosene/oxygen) as a real world example: Specific impulse 311 sec x 9.8 = 3047m/s exhaust velocity calculated initial mass / payload ratio e^(10/3.047)=26.6:1 Actual initial mass / payload ratio 1463 tonnes / 53 tonnes =27.6:1 Getting to the moon from low earth orbit further impacts the mass/payload ratio. For the following dV budgets we would have to apply a further mass / payload ratio, starting at low earth orbit, and assuming 4.4km/s effective exhaust velocity (H2/O2 engine) Low Earth orbit to: Lagrange points (where Earth and Lunar gravity are balanced) stopping and not merely flying through 3.43 to 3.97km/s > 2.18:1 to 2.47:1, depending on which point Low Lunar Orbit 4.04km/s > 2.5:1 Lunar surface 5.93km/s > 3.85:1 It's clear why the Apollo missions left the command module in lunar orbit with the fuel to turn around and go home (a burn of only 1.31km/s) and sent a separate module down to the lunar surface. Being able to make propellant on the moon would enable a lunar shuttle to meet an Earth supply ship, greatly reducing the amount of propellant required. We can actually do even better. Apollo required only 3.05 to 3.25km/s (median 3.15, ratio 2.04:1) to achieve translunar injection, which in the case of Apollo meant a free-return figure 8 orbit round the back of the moon that would return to Earth without power if there was a failure (a trajectory decision that saved the lives of the crew of Apollo 13.) the lunar shuttle would have to chase after the supply ship, retrieve the payload and decelerate back to the moon surface. In summary a vehicle to launch a given payload to the moon would be 3.85 times as heavy as a vehicle to launch the same payload to low earth orbit and would not return. With a lunar shuttle available that can be refueled on the moon and catch up to the earth vehicle, it would only need to be 2.04 times as heavy and would return to Earth on a free return trajectory. Unfortunately, refining vast quantities of propellant on the lunar surface would require vast quantities of energy. Water ice deposits are most likely to exist in craters at the poles, and therefore have little access to solar energy. This would probably mean bringing a small nuclear reactor, similar to the ones used on submarines, to the moon to provide for the power needs. CONSTRUCTION, COMFORT AND EXPERIMENTATION So I've just shown that the International Space Station could be moved to the moon, if we could accept a 2-4 times increase in Earth launch weights, plus the costs and risks associated with more complicated missions. It's doable, but is it worth it? To go to the moon, you really have to ask if there is anything that can be done there that can't be done on the international space station. I don't see construction as a major issue. A decent survey would reveal caves and old lava tubes suitable for habitation, with stable temperatures. An inflatable habitat protected by such a natural shelter would be ideal. However we are going to want to build some kind of structure sooner or later. Water would be useful in mixing whatever form of concrete was suitable on the moon (it would most certainly be different to regular Earth concrete, which requires CO2 to cure.) Water is a major factor in human comfort and experimentation. It can be used for recreation and bathing, as a working or heat transfer fluid in machinery and for chemistry. I don't see any practical need for it for growng of food (food can be brought from Earth if necessary) but surely a major reason for setting up a moon base would be to experiment with growing crops in an isolated system in low gravity. Finally, I din't thnk we'll be looking to mine the moon just yet, if ever. The cost of transport is just too great. In summary, I think the most pressing thing would be to undertake a (robot) survey of the moon, in particular of its water resources, and then try to develop existing technology around it. 

Some dutiful person may restore part of this chain of responsibility without thinking about the consequences... the first time. But eventually it will reach a completely disinterested bureaucrat or an inbox that is no longer monitored and Joe will die, probably along with any other inmates in the entire jail. 

Have you considered bargaining with the other party? If they have any respect for you, they may allow you to pick up some artworks and other stuff in trade for something they want. Simply buy passage and be ready for a double-cross. If the situation is completely hopeless, you might even get the losing civilization to negotiate a surrender, with the terms being that the "enemy" gives them time to make peace with their ending and you to preserve their art and history before they are wiped out of existence. The advantage to the enemy would be that they save a lot of resources in ending the siege quickly. It sounds cynical and even immoral to help the "enemy" destroy this civilization, but then, the Collectors are not interested in saving them, are they? 

As other answers have said, there is no evolutionary incentive for males to be intelligent, so evolution will reduce them to nothing more than horny little puppies. The issue then becomes how will a female who is ready to procreate identify a male with good genes? And the only answer that comes to mind is by looking at their mother. I see a situation where an existing women has a bunch of these horny mutts at home, and her friend comes round and decides to have a baby with one of them. She will give birth to a litter of males, and after several attempts, the female child she always wanted. Nature demands that there will be vastly more males than needed. This will lead to them being euthanised, as letting them go wild would create a problem similar to that of feral dogs (except that these would take leg humping to a new level.) It would be possible, but not necessarily the social norm, for two (or three or four) females to form a committed lesbian relationship and have children via each others male offspring. However if they were both virgins they would still need to lose their virginity with the male of a more experienced female in order to get started. And their offspring would always carry some of that experienced female's genes, so she might want to be part of their lives. Many species females have a naturally lower attraction for their relatives, to avoid incest. This is not so prevalent in males. Observation of the natural world shows horny, indiscriminate male monkeys trying to mate with close relatives and being rejected. On the other hand, the males of this species will need to clearly identify their mother as a provider and not a potential sex partner to avoid being thrown out of the brood for harrasing her. Ants and bees offer a relevant model. The sexual dimorphism of anglerfish (where the tiny male becomes a permanently attached sperm-producing parasite) is also of interest. 

In the near future (next few decades) a giant spaceship is detected as it decelerates on its way into the solar system. It heads for Earth orbit, but a few weeks before reaching Earth, it veers away and ends up in orbit around the sun not far from Earth, about 10 times the Earth-Moon distance. The ship doesn't respond in any way to attempted communications. NASA re-purposes a satellite that was scheduled to launch for Mars and approaches the ship. To everyone's surprise, the ship opens a large hangar door and sends some radio signals to the satellite. After some time and repeated signals, the door closes again. Next an international team goes and boards the ship. It turns out to be a generation ship but evidently failed, as it's full of dead human-size insectoids and only a few cryogenically frozen specimens, most also dead. The ship seems to be otherwise intact and is run by some kind of computer. Unfortunately, the computer is not compatible in anyway with Macs or any other human-made computers. With some advanced cameras, the displays can be converted to human vision and they appear to show that Earth has been rejected as a colony world and the next destination is an Earth-like planet most likely some 50 light-years away. There's also a countdown of uncertain length, but likely to be 3-4 months because that will be when the trajectory towards the next star is optimal. Some humans decide they want to grab this once in a lifetime chance to hitch a ride on this ship, despite the risk of meeting the same fate as the original crew. The technical part The aliens' basic physiology is compatible with Earth-life (the very reason they headed for Earth) and the atmosphere on the ship is readily breathable by humans. The water dispensed in the ship has way too high mineral content, but nothing that would destroy human filters and some specific taps supply demineralised water. However, the plants in the hydroponic farms are all toxic to humans and while the light seems good, the water is full of bacteria that kill any other plants. They need to be flushed and run manually somehow. The waste-recycling method is unknown (it can be adapted to make things more workable). The ship itself is designed in a very distributed and resilient way. Attempts to remove subsystems and attach human systems to their power supply points work once it's figured out the ship supplies DC electricity at the roughly the voltage indicated by the system upon connection. Unfortunately, no control connection seems to work, nor does the ship's computer interact with the systems in any way. The computer running the ship seems to have been programmed in a very permissive way. It doesn't take any hostile action and doesn't override or reverse non-damaging changes to the ship. It appears to recognize humans as living and treats them as if they were regular occupants, activating lights, heating and other functions on demand. It even responds to certain sounds, but the reply is always the same, most likely "I don't understand your request, try again". However, it doesn't recognize anyone or anything as having the authority to access or change the reactor and drive section nor the navigational systems. The same goes for the shuttles and landing craft in the hangars. The ship is going to depart and short of destroying it nothing will delay that. Humanity has one huge leg up: They have established a small base on Mars and were just preparing a serious colony mission consisting of 2 passenger ships holding 50 people each and several cargo ships to deliver machinery and supplies enough to set up a colony for those 100 people. The alien ship is much closer, so multiple trips per ship are possible. The sponsoring governments are loathe to postpone the Mars effort, but if the chances for surviving on the alien generation ship are good enough, they are willing to divert some or all the Mars colony ships. What resources do they need to take to the ship and what will it take to get them there? In response to comments and answers: The time limit is flexible in the service of storytelling. I obviously chose it too short, but it should not allow for complete preparation and a 99% certainty of survival. That said, for all intents and purposes a single person on board with enough supplies could live out their life on the ship, it seems to be that safe. But the new crew is going to have to get aboard with some stuff that they have to figure out on the way if they want to make it work in the long run. A lot of equipment is ready to go, thanks to the Mars mission. That probably includes a whole set of Hydroponic-ready plants that cover nutritional needs (though only tested up to few years with adults). Of course, the equipment was meant for only 100 people when at least ten times that will go on the alien ship. Of the cryogenic pods, only a few show status lights that appear to indicate all is well. The insectoids can't be revived yet (an attempt will result in the alien's death) and are not playing an active role in the story, but their presence obviously does. (Thanks liljoshu!) All the other insectoids were frozen where they died when the ship lowered the temperature to somewhat below zero degrees celcius. It's unclear what they died from, but there is no sign of disease or violence. There is also no evidence of a queen or other special types or aliens. The exact cause remains unknown during my story, though the leading theory becomes that they were hit by an intense radiation burst. Finally, one of the landing ships is pulled from the hangar to a safe distance and experimented on to try to disable the computer or drive system. It does not end well, so the decision is made to not tamper with the much bigger versions on the generation ship. 

The lowest density practical (excluding hydrogen and helium) liquid is liquid methane, with a density of about 0.65g/cm3 compared with water's 1g/cm3. There are few, if any, solids that will float in this unless they contain trapped gas. Ethane, propane and butane are not far behind. Steel ships float in water because they are mostly full of air. So your ship in a hydrocarbon ocean could be filled with atmosphere and float. Unless you have very high pressures. If you take liquid methane and seal it in a partially filled container, you will have methane liquid at the bottom and methane vapour above. Increase the temperature and the density of the liquid rises. The vapour pressure also rises, hence the vapour becomes more dense. Finally at −82.6 °C temperature and and 46 bar pressure (about 46 times earth atmosphere) the density of the gas and liquid phases becomes the same, and the two phases become indistinguishable. This is called the critical point. The critical point exists for pure liquids that are stable enough not to decompose before boiling. Ethane's is at 32C and 49 bar. So if you have a methane atmosphere over a methane ocean slightly below the critical point, it will not be practical to build a boat. The critical point temperature for ethane is more comfortable for humans, but the pressure is too much. 49 bar is equivalent to about 490m ocean depth on earth, but the record for scuba diving is 332m (short term.) Unfortunately these types of pressures are the only way to make the atmosphere dense enough that a boat filled with atmosphere would not float. The only way to have a gas much denser than ethane while retaining a low boiling point would be to consider a noble gas atmosphere (such as Krypton) over an ocean of hydrocarbon. Pressures would still need to be quite high but not as high as 49 bar. But the heavier noble gases are quite rare so the possibility of finding an entire atmosphere of heavy noble gas is zero unless artifically created by some former superadvanced alien's terraforming project. Making your balloon float is easy. Fill it with hydrogen or helium. A hydrogen filled balloon will not present a fire risk unless the atmosphere contains oxygen. 

At your technology levels, it will depend on a single question: How effective are anti-missile defenses? If and only if ships can achieve something like a 99.9% success rate intercepting missiles before they get close enough to do damage would you see any other type of weapon. (Railguns would be good against stationary targets at any range, but the question is about ship-to-ship). Here's why: An invading ship starts out very far away from anything except possibly a defensive station near the wormhole if the wormhole is static. To attack with any medium or short ranged weapons it would need to commit to an approach vector that would clearly signal its intentions and target to any defenders. If the shortest route takes two weeks for example, a feint would add an unacceptable extra few weeks in enemy territory. So the ideal strategy for an invader would be to only stay long enough to locate its targets, fire a swarm of missiles and retreat. Again, firing some slugs with a big railgun would work for "stationary" targets whose location can be predicted from orbital mechanics and measurements. If one percent of the missiles gets through and cripples a target ship, firing hundreds of missiles would be preferable to risking a big ship and trained crew. For the defenders, missiles would also be the weapon of choice. They can handle much higher acceleration than manned craft, so can reach the target hours or days earlier, long before any unguided weapon has a chance of hitting warships that constantly change their vector for exactly that reason. So, what would happen if all ships sport point defense lasers that vaporize all missiles? First off, such a weapon is likely to vaporize drones, fighters and torpedoes as well. In fact, the only weapon that might make it past this defense would be a railgun, as vaporizing the guidance system or thrusters of a missile is much easier than vaporizing a solid metal slug, where even 10% remaining could still cause serious damage due to the high kinetic energy. With only lasers and railguns left, the ship with the stronger laser and/or stronger anti-laser armour would try to close the distance to get as much energy on the opponent as they can, while the other ship would try to stay far away and score a hit with the railgun by predicting the other ship's movement. All kinds of subterfuge would likely be employed to get the opponent into the crosshairs, which would count for more than sheer firepower. 

If this happened tomorrow, I think the only place people might survive without energy from the sun is Iceland. The population is small, they already generate a significant proportion of their electricity from geothermal power, and they are used to cold weather. I'm not considering oil rich places like Alaska because that is really stored energy from photosynthesis. But if we do consider them, the South Pole research station is another place that might hold out, as there are a lot of smart people there, though maybe not with the right skills. The other thing is, keeping warm in a geothermal area is significantly simpler than in an oil-rich area. All you have to do is dig down! The Maori of New Zealand cook food underground using rocks heated by fire, but the practice surely originates from geothermal cooking. In a matter of days, though, it's going to get really cold, and carry on till it gets to about the night time temperature of the moon (approx -233C.) That's below the freezing point of nitrogen and oxygen. Obviously it could take decades for the oceans to freeze, so I would expect the temperature to hold at a plateau somewhat below zero C for a very long time So the people of Iceland are going to have to be very resourceful and build an insulated biosphere in record time, and then will have a few decades to make it airtight. Food is likely to last from months to years, but ultimately it will have to be grown inside the biosphere using geothermal electricity. I think they could possibly survive, but it wouldn't be much fun. Given more advanced technology (fusion reactors?) and a decent warning, I think humanity could make a good go of it, but living on a sunless Earth would be considerably more difficult than living on present-day Mars. 

Lovecraftian Periodic Cicadas If volcanoes are just too mundane... For a completely different approach, you can have the sky fill with clouds of Periodic Cicadas. The Earth versions live underground for 13-17 years and then the entire species/brood emerges at once and takes to the skies, to meet, mate, lay eggs and die. Your planet's bugs are more... Lovecraft. They have been sleeping underground for hundreds or even thousands of years, waiting for a sign of some kind. It might be a big solar flare, passing meteor or mortals disturbing the ground with their construction activities. Now, they rise from the ground, take to the skies and head for the light side, blocking out the sun with their swarms. Oh btw, they are also the size of cars, not coins. A comet If you want the darkness to be external to the planet, here is a somewhat weaker scenario. The solar system has a big outer planet that keeps slinging balls of dust and ice at the sun. Big ones. None of these was or is on a collision course with the planet, but they have the unfortunate tendency to break apart into clouds of highly reflective dust somewhat inside the planet's orbit, leaving the planet in the shadow until they disperse. 

According to thermodynamics, more ordered states are favoured at lower temperatures, so essentially what you are looking for is a system which increases in volume as it becomes more ordered, which is unusual. As mentioned in another answer, this happens when beer turns to ice, but the volume change is quite small. Another process is as follows: Hydrogen sulphide generated in oil refinery desulphurisation processes is converted to sulphur by the Claus process: 

Other gases Other suitable gases include propane (again requiring more energy per unit mass than nitrogen for vaporization than nitrogen, and I can say from experience that a splash of propane "feels" colder than nitrogen.) The dragon could choose to breathe icy propane, or instead ignite it and breathe fire. Carbon monoxide, CO is another posibility (highly toxic and moderately flammable as well as being a gas) but its critical point is well below ambient temperature, like nitrogen. Several existing organisms use formic acid as a weapon, and formic acid decomposes catalytically to carbon monoxide and water. Sulphur dioxide fits in with the brimstone idea. It has a boiling point of -10C, which is perhaps a little high, and is toxic and corrosive. Generating SO2 chemically under pressure would be difficult because of the requirement for atmospheric oxygen, unless the dragon breathed in the air and dived to great depths like a sperm whale in order to compress the oxygen.
