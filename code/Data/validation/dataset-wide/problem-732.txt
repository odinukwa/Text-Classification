I think your short-term best option is to use sealant, and top it up every 3-6 months as per directions on the pack. This won't help a sudden blowout though. Carry a cheap tube, tools and pump on every ride, and more tubes on longer rides (I carry one per 50 km planned.) Booting on the inside won't help here, unless there was a tube installed as well. If you enter any races with safety checks, they will probably fail the tire as a matter of course. In that case, just suck it up and replace. Lastly - keep an eye on it too. Look at it every time you do the weekly M check and make sure its not growing, that you can't see cords or tube through the cut. 

I see a moderately knobbly tyre - if you're riding roads then consider more of a neutral commuter tyre tread for easier riding. 

This is the screen that shows up when you stop. The map with track at the top can be displayed full-screen while riding, and if you have planned a route the track is overlaid on the map as well. Later analysis can be done on the info - here's the link for that ride: $URL$ Note I had a HRM but no cadence sensor. 

Do you have barrel adjusters anywhere in the cable part of the system? Could be a simple matter of cable stretch on the inner cable, so its now a couple of millimetres longer than it used to be... Either twiddle the adjusters, or undo the pinch bolt that holds the inner cable to the hydraulic actuator and pull it tight. 

Bearings need repacking and ball replacement when the wheel isn't running smoothly, or has crunchiness when rolling. So it could be time to redo the bearings. Depending on what system the wheels use, it could be as little as a $5 packet of bearings and 5c worth of grease. Sealed bearings are even easier - if they feel bad/rattly/noisy, they need replacing. Specific to your bike, there's probably dirt and wear all over, so fixing one thing might not restore it to original performance. Consider giving the entire transmission a clean, check the chain for wear, check the tyre's air pressure and that there is no brake rub. 

Technology has progressed since this question was asked. Here's a bone-conduction earpiece, that works by injecting the vibration around your ears rather than through your ears. The price is coming down but they're still much more expensive than most headphones. However no moving speaker makes them more water resistant, therefore tougher. 

Steel Cables aka Tensegrity or Tensional Integrity This is not a unique frame build material because wires or cables only work under tension. So this bike requires at least two beams of some other non-compressible material, in the form of a main beam and a seat post. Earlier: 

I personally have suffered two front-wheel slide-outs, one on the road and one on a dry singletrack. Here's the road one: 

Pic1 Pic2 Pic3 Pic4 Pic5 Pic6 show a licence plate, demonstrate that two following cars passed safely but stayed in their lane, and a shot of the driver's face in the side mirror. Whether a note from local plod helps modify driver behaviour or not, I don't know. But my local police do act on these reports. 

I ride both sorts, and the width of the main road's shoulder is balanced out by the increase in traffic. Locally our side roads might have exactly no sealed surface outside the lane. Never wear ear-blocking anything when riding such a road - your ears are one of the best radars for sensing if a car is coming. Ideally, I'd ride a road that has zero cars, even if it takes me out of my way. However river bridges tend to be only on main roads reducing the options. Suggestion whatever road you ride, consider investing in daytime running lights for your bike. These are essentially red back lights that are too bright for night usage. Sometimes they may be yellow/orange, but never white (because they face the rear.) 

I'm 40, and have back and joint issues that make getting up in the morning hard work. If I get-up-and-go its terrible for the first half-hour. So here's what helps me: 

Only applies if your bike has a disk brake, and a QR lever that could interfere with the disk in any open or closed position. This could affect bikes from the 90s through to about 2015. 

I am researching for a new road bike for myself, trying to identify the must-haves from the nice-to-have features. Disk/Disc brakes are on the must-have list, but the descriptions of brake pads are confusing. Sintered: with metal in the pads, better in the wet and for heavier riders, and transits more heat than resin. Longer lasting Resin or Organic: Non-metallic, porous, worse in water. Much better initial grab, quicker wearing My question is: Are there any compelling downsides to running a sintered brake pad and a resin brake pad inside the same caliper/calliper? 

EDIT: This answer supposed that the rear chainstay was welded to the frame. As such its inapplicable to this question, but being left for completeness. 

You could improve your commute time by carrying less stuff on the bike. I keep spare clothes and a pair of shoes at work for the few times I need to change, rather than carrying them with me. Depending on your climate, you might get away without a coat/jacket going to work, but require it on the way home so consider keeping a jacket at each end too, ready for a downturn in the weather. Carrying less stuff makes the ride faster, and more enjoyable too. 

More directly - do you need to carry all your books back and forth as well as a laptop? Consider finding the electronic format of your texts and have that on disk. Do your writing on the laptop, so no need for much paper. Leave your shoes at the other end, no need to carry them back and forth, or consider wearing them to ride the bike. tl;dr two large waterproof panniers and a rear rack for your bike. You can still use a smaller backpack as overflow for heavy days. 

Reassemble is the reverse process. Start by refitting the thin plastic ring, and then work down towards the bottom. Insert main bolt. Then flip the whole thing, and refit the bottom cover then the brake lever. Make sure to get them lined up like this and that there are two holes the inner cable will pass through to get out - they have to line up. Also, in other angles the upshift/finger lever will obstruct the brake or the bars. 

Fresh answer - I did a bit of a ride yesterday and it was quite warm. So I ended up rolling my pants cuffs up to my knees for added cooling. An unexpected side effect is that on my shins I could feel air gusts and eddies that were different depending which way I was riding. Its really hard to explain, but in a crosswind I could feel a wind vortex on the inside of my left leg and on the outside of my right leg. In a headwind I could feel the wind curling around behind my shins, and in a tailwind there was no particular sensation either way. So if like me you habitually wear pants, try some shorts, or roll up your pants cuffs and see how it feels. Mind out for sunburn though - that's a whole separate painful issue right now. 

Camera mount I've got one of these on my stem. There's a layer of dense foam underneath which helps a little. 

I've worked on a couple bikes that have had frontal impacts. Check the underside of the downtube for any abrasions or rubber marks. You might find the front tyre has touched the downtube in the collision, giving you an idea of how far it bent and has come back. Theres a fold in the downtube and I can see a completely broken top tube, so 

Since its already open, you should consider a clean of all the parts before reassembling. Degreaser and a clean rag helps - paper towels tend to be quite linty. Do a close inspection of the cones and cups - the running surface should be smooth and chip free. If the ball bearings are vaguely dull just buy new ones - they're cheap. 

Both of those screenshots show heartrate. A phone can't do that alone - you need a heartrate sensor. Phones with ANT+ radios are better than bluetooth sensors because the batteries last for 4-6 months, whereas bluetooth sensors are a much shorter runtime. Also note, that phones with a "pulse meter" are useless for this purpose. 

New transport options bring changes - and it takes three generations before those changes become natural. Electric cars will take 60 years to become completely normal and ubiquitous, cos thats about how long it took for horses to disappear completely from the road transport network. 

Clean them with IPA and possibly replace the front pads. I doubt the pad gap is too generous because your lever is not bottoming out on the bar. BUT another thought - a cable-operated caliper is normally one-sided. So one brake pad is fixed and supposed to run very close to the rotor. The other moving pad subtly bends the rotor into the fixed pad. You may need to confirm that the non-moving pad/rotor gap is nice and small. If its big, loosen the two caliper mounting bolts a bit, shim between the rotor an non-moving pad with a sheet of paper or similar, then hold down the lever while tightening the two bolts. Then extract shim. Your brake may have a lot of room on the other side now, so you need to take the slack out of the inner cable at that point. 

At our local bike coop, we've welded some old bike frames together to act as a anti-burglary window grille. They were steel though. I've used chainstays and seat stays as robust tent pegs, for staking down a plastic greenhouse. Worked well once the ends were hammered shut. Dollarwise, recycling is your best bet for aluminium, because its $4 to $15/kilo locally depending on grade and whether you parted all the non-aluminium off. 

It doesn't matter which is "better" in terms of componentry. What matters is fit - you should try them out but sitting on them and adjusting saddle height. Then take a 2 minute ride up and down the road. This is normally enough to show you a poor fit immediately. If it feels wrong, it is wrong. If you think the bike is good, take it on a longer ride, at least an hour. Try and get some up and downhill, and some straight+flat+fast, and a section of turns too. That should be enough to exercise and evaluate how it feels. Answer Ride them and see which feels best. Personally, the Giant looks newer, but the Trek look prettier with a more-horizontal top tube. 

Notice the spokes are laid out evenly spaced still? Further info here $URL$ Finally you might have been thinking about properly engineered racing wheels like this one: 

Assuming your terrain is relatively flat: Average cyclists will be 10-15 km/h, so that's 8.5 and 6 minutes. I've walked past a grannie cyclist while out exercising my dog, so she would be doing under 6 km/h and at that speed would take 21 minutes to get to the station. A fast road bike does 40 km/h and the pros can do 50-55 km/h sustained, so that's 2.1 minutes and 1.5 minutes respectively. The world land speed record on a bike is well above 130 km/h and at that speed you'd be at the station in ~38 seconds. The formula is 

The strength of a wheel has comparatively little to do with its radius, and a lot more to do with the quality of the wheel building, and the number of spokes, and the design of the rim. If a frame is designed for a 700c wheel then fitting smaller rims will change the handling, and will 700c is 622mm in diameter, and 26" is 559mm, so you're dropping by 31mm overall. However your 26" wheel may have larger tyres to offset this decrease. As a test, find/borrow a couple of 26" wheels and fit them to your bike. Even if the drive train doesn't mate up and the brakes don't fit, just quietly scooter-about in a safe space. You should be able to "glide" and coast, and feel how the steering is different. Do report back on your findings. Don't take this test rig on the road unless the brakes work. I expect that the decrease in trail will make the steering very floppy, and it will want to turn a lot easier. Based on this test, make your own decision. 

There's also the rotor design. There should be holes such that the whole brake pad presses over a void, and several times in the rotation. Some really poor rotors don't have holes arranged right, so one circle of rotor is plain metal the whole way. This doesn't clean the pad and contributes to bad braking. Thickness is partially to cope with heat. More mass takes longer to heat to extreme levels. Less mass is lighter for riding. Also thicker rotors will resist bending more-so than thinner ones of any quality. Rotor Size or Diameter is a design thing, not a quality thing. You need the rotor to suit the location of your calipers, and they will depend on the fork mounts and the rating of the fork. Same goes for the ISO 6 bolt holes or for the centerlock style - it is yet another competing standard with relatively minimal effective braking differences. 

It may be a long way down the road, but look for a pump who manufacturer offers rebuild kits for their older models. Park pumps definitely have rebuild / service kits, as do Zefal and Silca. However the extra cost of the premium brand might be weighed up against the value. 

We don't normally recommend products by name, but if you go into a LBS and buy spokes you'll probably be offered DT spokes, which are perfectly adequate. Check their website for comparisons, but notice that they don't have specific spokes for downhill vs uphill vs espatchio vs whatever kind of riding you want. A good wheel is a good wheel anywhere, and the tyre has more variation on the type of riding. I'd bet a 29" MTB rim in a road bike, or a 700c road rim in a MTB would work perfectly well for either terrain. 

Take your back wheel out of the bike. This will require disconnecting the brake cable. Remove the cover of your band brake - inside should be the pull-lever and 340 degrees of flexible band. The whole brake is dead if the oil has contaminated this flexible brake band. Inspect brake drum on the wheel axle. I bet its oily. Clean the brake drum using a solvent - I'd use petrol but a degreaser might smell better. You need to remove the oil from the brake band. I've done this on contaminated car brake shoes using heat from a blowtorch and rags to soak up brake fluid from the surface. You'll have to repeat this heat/pat cycle a bunch of times. Reassemble and refit. You can test the band brake on the drum by hand before reinstalling it in the wheel. 

Answer: as far as you need to and want to. 20 miles with rest breaks should be a good starting target. I did this - my first "big" ride a year ago was 20 km total, and it completely exhausted me. A year later I'm doing a 116 km ride. The best technique is many little steps. Pick places that are ~10 miles away and do a round trip, stopping in the middle for a drink and snack. Then up the distance after a 4-6 weeks or forgo the stop in the middle. Also do a "scenic tour" when coming home from work. I do 3km to work, and 10~20km on the way back. I prefer to have a calm ride to work and do the exercise on the way home. Track your rides with something like $URL$ Run the app on a fancyphone and it will keep all your records for you like average speed and best time on segments. Stats and leaderboards are a good motivation. Make your rides useful - if you need to go somewhere for a purpose, allow the time to ride rather than drive. Exception being if you need to be presentable/not sweaty. Make your rides safe. Avoid the scary roads, have bright clothes, lights etc. Remember its not just distance. You should spend time grinding up your local hills, and whizzing down them too. Set yourself significant goals with rewards. I started with a MTB, bought a real (used) road bike on completion of an event, and now I'm preparing for Le Race, which is 100 km with ~4km vertical. When I complete that I'll consider buying a brand new road bike. All this can help you increase your distance and speed and decrease your recovery times. 

I can't find a clearly written spec page for this bike, but based on the picture your easiest change will be to swap out the cassette/freewheel for a 7 speed with a larger number of teeth. The question is whether the rear derailleur can fit a larger gear. You'll also need a new chain to add more links. Your other option is to replace the whole front chainring assembly with a smaller one. At this price point there's a good chance its a common square taper fitment, so you might even be able to rescue a smaller crank off a donor-bike. You could even use a triple crank off a MTB but only hook the chain onto the middle or little ring. This would be the most economical option, the only bike-specific tool you need is a crank puller.
