Wikipedia's article titled Catholic Church and slavery says Saint Patrick advocated abolition of slavery in the fifth century, and cites Life in Medieval Times by Marjorie Rowling. I've read that same assertion in other places. Where is this in Saint Patrick's writings? 

In 1788 the new Constitution of the United States went into effect in the states that had ratified it, and that meant elections had to be organized for representatives in Congress and for members of the electoral college (in those days I suspect they were literally for electors and the presidential candidates were not named on the ballots). Today all presidential elections and elections for members of congress were held on the same day throughout the country. Was that done in 1788? If so, who organized it? Was the Congress of the Confederation involved? (Elections for U.S. senators were done by state legislatures then, and I suspect they were not all on the same day.) 

Bearing in mind the dates already mentioned in the OP, and the fact that the British evacuation of New York City did not occur until November 25, 1783, there was no functioning government of New York during the negotiations, nor had there been since the evacuation of Manhattan by Washington's army on November 16th, 1776. Vermont was a center of fighting between the colonies and British Quebec due to the water route through Lake Champlain. The exigencies of war lead them to organize themselves, in 1777, though the Continental Congress refused to recognize this self-generated status due to complaints from the exiled government of New York. The Haldimand negotiations(1781) went nowhere, and Haldimand said Mr. Allen was evasive, and the British concluded that the Vermonter's were primarily interested in gaining leverage in negotiations with the government of New York over future statehood. In the meantime, British and Indian raids were stopped. Returning to the negotiations, which were conducted by a committee of three in Paris , none of the colonies were directly involved in the negotiations. The committee represented the interests of the Nation: here is a transcript of the treaty. The states are listed in article 1st; no mention is made of Vermont, for the Continental Congress never recognized it as a state; it only achieved this status years later, in 1791. The boundaries are listed in article 2d, and are geographical. Many of the boundaries were slightly revised by later negotiations, especially following the Jay Treaty of 1794 (signed 18 August 1795). By the terms of this treaty the Indian Wars of the Northwest Territories were ended, and the British evacuated Detroit and many other western posts which were to have been evacuated according to the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1783). But the affairs of Vermont had been concluded earlier, and the British were to return to their area during the War of 1812. 

ZIP codes were introduced in 1963, and ZIP is an acronym for "Zone Improvement Plan." ZIP codes were to be an improvement on "postal zones". Thus before ZIP codes existed one would write: John Xmith3001 Zarthan Avenue Minneapolis 16, Minnesota The number 16 was the zone number; this address was in postal zone 16 within the city of Minneapolis. This number followed the name of the city and preceded the name of the state, and was not used in small towns having only one post office. When ZIP codes were introduced, in most cases the zone number became the last two digits of the ZIP code. Thus the address above became this: John Xmith3001 Zarthan Avenue Minneapolis, Minnesota 55416 (If I'm not mistaken, in 1963, the Postmaster General was a member of the president's cabinet, heading the "Department of the Post Office". He was one of two cabinet members who headed the Department of Something but who were not called the Secretary of Something, but instead the Something(else) General. The other one still exists: the head of the Department of Justice is not called the Secretary of Justice, but the Attorney General.) 

You can search Archives.org for books with the title "Democracy in America"; then do a text search for "experiment". In the above example there are several pages containing "experiment"; p.23 is the last page of chapter 1, and the final paragraph begins "In that land the great experiment ...". This is the New Edition, translated by Henry Reeve, C.B., published in 1889. This later version, published 1900, with different translators also contains this phrase. For comparison, the thirteenth French edition, of 1850; the final paragraph says "des fondements nouveaux" - which in literal translation is "new foundations". 

Napoleon's letter seeking hospitality from the British The Prince Regent declined to offer hospitality in Britain, so he was summarily transported to St. Helena, a distant and isolated island in the south Atlantic, to stay for the remainder of his days. Note added thanks to the research of @user8654. A few months later an act was passed "for the more effectually detaining in custody Napoleon Buonaparte", an ex-post facto law intended to regularize Napoleon's indefinite detention at the pleasure of the British government. In this act it states that he is to be treated as a prisoner of war, this despite the fact that all prisoners captured during the wars have already been released. This act regularized Napoleon's indefinite detention. Prisoners and Detainees in War discusses the evolution of the legal theory of prisoners taken during war; it has evolved considerably since the days of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars; one should not expect that the legal status of "Prisoner of War" could even be determined for a ruler who had abdicated 

My question is: Has the history of what the states have done about this been written? (BTW, the term "electoral college" is unofficial, imported from Germany's First Reich, in which membership in the electoral college was hereditary.) 

Fanny Allen was a daughter of Colonel Ethan Allen of the Continental Army, noted for taking Fort Ticonderoga from the British by surprising them while they slept. (Or General Ethan Allen if you like; he was a colonel in the Continental Army and a general in the Vermont militia.) Ethan Allen wrote a book on theology and was considered a Deist; he was avowedly not a Christian. Fanny Allen was four years old when her father died. She relocated to Quebec from her native Vermont and became a Catholic nun. Did she express any opinions of her father's book, or of her father, that survive today? 

In the book Napoleon After Waterloo: England and the St. Helena Decision By Michael John Thornton the status of Napoleon is discussed in great detail, including questions of law. There are several considerations: 

So prior to the invention of more modern tools used to shear sheep, the wool was simply plucked or combed off when the sheep began to molt. One can also "pluck" wool from the bushy undergrowth which is the natural aid to the animals, which helps them to complete the molt. Thus hacking the wool off with sharp obsidian blades is unlikely - one merely waits for the appropriate season, and uses combs and fingers! Modern shearing is more efficient: takes less time, and gets all of the wool in its best condition, but combing and plucking will get the job done. 

In the 18th century, if I understand correctly, the king of England appointed the governors of the thirteen colonies in North America. How far beyond royal appointments of governors did British rule extend? One obvious answer is that in the 1760s the British Parliament began trying to impose taxes on Americans --- money to be sent from America to Britain. Another is that when Britain went to war against France in 1756, colonial Americans helped the British conquer the French colony of Canada. After the taxation laws of the 1760s some American statesmen took the position that the colonies had their own legislatures and, although they were subjects of the same king as the British, and the king therefore appointed their governors, the British Parliament had no more right to legislate for America the the Virginia House of Burgesses had to legislate for England. So a question is: before the tax acts, how extensive was legislation by Parliament that was intended to be enforced in America, and how effective was the enforcement? Added somewhat later: Another instance of governing from England was the order-in-council signed by King George III on July 20, 1764, stating that the disputed territory claimed by both New York and New Hampshire belonged to New York. That disputed territory is what later became the state of Vermont. The ruling followed an ex-parte hearing, i.e. the king and council heard from only one side: the province of New York. Then in 1767 a further order was issued in response to a petition from the inhabitants of the "New Hampshire Grants", as that territory was then called, saying the province of New York ought to recognize New Hampshire land grants issued before the order-in-council of 1764. However, this was clearly not routine governance. 

An elaboration on my comment; the bad idea came from my distant cousin, John Adams! How ‘His Highness’ George Washington Became ‘Mr. President’

Attalus III Philometor, 133 BC, leaves his kingdom to Rome. The Wikipedia article on Attalus III has very little more to add. Was this voluntary? There was an uprising following the occupation by Rome, with support of the neighboring kingdoms. One neighbor, Mithridates V, was a Roman ally, though he may have been playing a double game; certainly his son was doing so during his long reign. More detail is found in the History of Rome, Vol. IV, p. 317 THE HISTORY OF ROME FROM THE FIRST PUNIC WAR TO THE DEATH OF CONSTANTINE. By B.G. NIEBUHR, published 1844. pp. 317-318 

Is there any account of the politics of the revisions of Vermont's constitution in 1793? When Vermont was admitted to the Union on March 4, 1791, it continued to function under the constitution of 1786 that was written while Vermont was an independent country (and which in turn superseded the constitution of 1777). On this matter it is very easy to surmise that a major motive of the revision was deletion of the lengthy condemnations of the two former enemy states, Britain and New York. It seems especially inappropriate to continue to speak officially of New York as an enemy after admission to the Union. (It just occurred to me that I don't know at what point the confiscations from, and deportations of, "Yorkers" ended in Vermont. In 1784 after the U.S. concluded peace with the British (and the British ceded Vermont to the U.S. although Vermont's government didn't recognize that), the governor of New York was actively threatening to invade Vermont and asking for the support of Congress in so doing.) But a surmise about the motives is not an account of events. In particular, did the Council of Censors recommend the revision? (Robert Mello's definitive biography of Moses Robinson says nothing about the 1793 revision. I conclude that Robinson --- at that time a U.S. senator --- did not participate this time around.) 

Why does everyone use seconds/minutes/hours today? These units were adopted in the west in ancient times, by the Greeks, who borrowed it from their middle eastern neighbors, the Babylonians, who had used it before them. It's all because time-keeping, with seconds, minutes, and hours, originates with astronomical observation, and the art and science are ancient: the 60 seconds dates to at least the late Babylonian period, and was taken up by the Greeks. Tracing back further, the Babylonian's defined the circle as 360 degrees, as did the Akkadians, and the Sumerians before them: The 360-degree circle is 4400 years old. The usual theory is that 360 is close to the number of days in a year, and as a multiple of 60, it has many exact divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360. This makes 24 exact divisors! As the stars are the great clock, astronomers lead the way in time-keeping, and their systems were useful also for navigation. In the West, the continuity of history almost guaranteed the primacy of a single system; the march of technology and armies carried it to the rest of the world during the last few hundred years. Today it is enshrined in international standards. For example, China converted to the western system in 1645. See Why is a minute divided into 60 seconds, an hour into 60 minutes, yet there are only 24 hours in a day?, in Scientific American. 

Mathematicians are better at mathematics than at history, and have perpetuated an error concerning what Euclid did. They frequently state in textbooks and elsewhere that Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers is by contradiction. But it is not. Euclid considered what happens if you multiply finitely many prime numbers and then add 1. For example: (2 × 11 × 37) + 1 = 815 The number you get cannot be divisible by any of the finitely many prime numbers you started with. 815 cannot be divisible by 2 because 814 is; 815 cannot be divisible by 11 because 814 is; 814 cannot be divisible by 37 because 814 is. (The next prime number after 814 that is divisible by 37 is 814+37; the next after 814 that is divisible by 11 is 814+11; the next after 814 that is divisible by 2 is 814+2.) Therefore, whichever prime numbers 815 is divisible by, whether it is prime itself or not, cannot be among the finitely many you started with (in this example 2, 11, and 37). (In fact 815 is 5 × 163, and 5 and 163 are prime.) In this way it is seen that every finite list of prime numbers can be extended to a longer finite list of prime numbers. That is how Euclid prove there are infinitely many prime numbers. Catherine Woodgold and I wrote a joint paper in which we refuted the historical error and explained some practical reasons why it matters: Michael Hardy and Catherine Woodgold, "Prime Simplicity", Mathematical Intelligencer, volume 31, number 4, fall 2009, pages 44–52. I learned only after the paper appeared that the historical error may have originated with Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. It appears in his posthumous book on number theory.
