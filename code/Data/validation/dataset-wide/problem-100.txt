Camels and a pully-system. This is highly variable, but I would anticipate 5 to 10 in single-file line; with the cars, I am confident from my experience in the Gulf that a single camel can pull this. Does Khufu really care about safety? Otherwise, you can ensure wheels run in a closed wooden track, and that inspections of the whole system are undertaken frequently by his talented engineers. 60 years of active service is possible with frequent maintenance. After that, there will be little left of your coaster within just a few years. Leather bands on the wheels, some bits might be preserved under sand, but that's it. Maybe there was a roller coaster back then... I can't imagine a roller coaster that lasted 60 years (and disintegrated after that) would affect modern history. Keep in mind that Egyptians had technological sophistication that was independently re-invented later in Europe, such as scientific empiricism (Ebers Papyrus, 1550BC), which was later attributed to philosophers such as John Locke in the 1800s. 

Yeah, I can't give it in a nice presentation, but I can tell you now that we understand that North America has been transformed into this island continent, with all else being equal... The one thing you're lacking - not a bad thing - here is a wide open gulf coast that helps the Mississippi basin. North America would be a barren desert in the center if it weren't for the gulf (not saying a desert is bad, just saying it wouldn't be the same). Your mountains are obstructing moisture from the south. You will get cold dry air from the north in the center and temperate humid climates on the very east and west coast. You can give the central desert a nice fertile basin by using fossil aquifers, but I don't think you'll get any formidable rain from the north. Your east and west coasts will be extraordinarily fun to hike about, I think. 

In my alternate history, during the Islamic golden age (in this case, 9th century Arabia - present day Oman), my characters are building a series of glass towers. They are like lighthouses traversing from present-day Muscat to Niswah; 6 towers, one every five miles (total 30 mile journey). For aesthetic purposes, they want to make them out of glass with minimal stone support. 

This is a totally speculative answer, as it is about predicting the future, but I will take a stab at it. Further Interaction of Information Depending on the demographic, the phone will be more than "one-way." I don't mean to suggest that it's not interactive already, but that more data from our phones will be collectable. My blood sugar level from a sensor, her rapid HIV scan, his appraisal of the room ("is the light in this cafe optimal for reading?"), and our wine's preliminary taste-by-phone ("how high is the sulfide level; how many tannins are there; how many calories does this have?"). And so on. Further Utility Watching when mobile phones incorporated cameras was fascinating. Soon, they should be able to do more things, like a Swiss Army knife. Some phones (or watches, or devices) may be able to read a book out-loud to a child, repel mosquitoes (ha), even clean the air around you; these are things that require larger devices today, but remember how big a camera was in 1980? Under-developed Regions Perhaps a phone can not only detect water quality, but purify or sterilize it: again, of course this requires a lot of work today, but maybe in the future, it requires a tiny device: don't underestimate materials-science. Similarly, it may provide educational interactive information and way-finding for civic resources. Panic-Button I'd really love phones/watches/devices to incorporate an easy button or gesture that alerts emergency services to you ASAP. Of course, since I butt-dial people all the time, I would hope it's a procedure that is easy, but not accidentally activated. This is all purely speculative, of course. 

There would have to be a reason for a shark to get to that size, but there isn't one on Earth today. Sharks are successful hunters, and thrive at their current sizes unless impacted by change in climate and human intervention. So, if you place a large number of extraordinarily sized prey (or large volumes that require a large mouth), then it would make sense to me to have a large predator like a shark. 

In our world, Mother Nature has returned and is pleased with the spread of one of the most ubiquitous birds, the Peregrine Falcon and has granted them the intelligence capacity of a human from now on. That is to say, they are born and grow in intellect like we do. For 16+ years, they can learn just like we do - or even more quickly if there's a will. Humankind is aware of this, and ready to help and hinder. There is now a bird that can read and can operate a computer or a kindle or whatever, can learn a rough way to communicate in bird-speak. In one generation of the birds, with our assistance, what would be the result of this experiment? Note: This is 2017, it is the same Earth, and their species will forever have the capacity to learn - I am just interested in the first generation (whether they're a chick or an adult, suddenly with the capacity to learn) and how they integrate (or don't). Their range, as you know, is pretty much all over the world. 

Mega-AquaBoa-Constrictor The problem I have with animals biting the ship is that one bite would likely deter them. It seems like a lot of sea animals like sharks usually take one bite of something that they don't like and then move along. A hyper-evolved boa constrictor that has grown substantially large and evolved to adapt to deep sea water would be drifting around snagging wales by looping over them. Along comes Columbus and she soars up out of the water, lands over the deck, and constricts it, feeling the 'bones' begin to snap. But when she goes to eat it, she is disappointed. This can happen time and again, because the boats still look like the bellies of whales from below. Happy writing. 

As you mentioned in your comment, you're interested in the new world. I will have to work on the assumptions: This brave new world has been made to be Earthlike. It is occupied sparsely by 2.5bn randomly selected Earthlings. Distribution - I suspect your world - like ours, but with half the people - will consist of densely populated areas as well as rural, unless your story dictates otherwise. In this case, you have the luxury of having a lot of different stories of cooperation or warring, depending on where the people are located and how they're distributed. Arrival - Your people have arrived with almost nothing but a virgin planet. The commonly accepted hierarchy of needs must be met; they will next work towards shelter, clothing, and food. Food will consist initially of gathering, depending on your planet. Those dropped in the severe places might perish versus those placed in temperate and abundant locations. There will be little hunting with the exception of those few who have mastered the skill - they may be valued for their skills. Language - While the probability is that Mandarin, Hindustani, and Arabic languages will slightly dominate (percentage-wise), the common language will remain English/Germanic, Romantic, or Slavic. These are common second or business international languages. Storyline - This is purely speculative, but I can imagine you will have the typical tropes of the leaders, workers, planners, and thinkers. You'll also have your 'criminals' who will devise clever ways to sustain themselves off the backs of others. Agriculture? - I had a professor who posited that the actual leading causes of agriculture in cultural hearths (Middle East, Central America, North Africa, East Asia, Greece, etc.) were developed for the purpose of distillation before food security. In this case, though, I think modern humans would appreciate the latter as much as the former. This is a very broad question, so everything that I've included should be a 'comment', but is too much to fit. There are a million other things that could be here. 

Acknowledgement and Engagement, with Self Interest I'm always an optimist, so I'm taking this tact, don't roll your eyes. Limitations - Classified information is typically limited to a very small group of people. Hopefully, this information is limited to the Executive Branch of the US Government, with the addition of specialists and experts instead of crazies in Congress who throw snowballs to dispute climate change. This hopefully ensures a rational, and moderate approach to the situation (hey, I said I was an optimist). Competition - No matter who is the responsible State or Meta-national corporation on Earth, they will attempt to ensure their superiority in the situation if it benefits them. In this case the United States is well-equipped to try to keep this information well-separated from other countries. Mitigation - In this situation, there should be a well-assembled team to prepare "what-if" scenarios that would threaten the United States in any way (even via externalities). This could include, "what if they are aggressive". Outreach - There would be an opportunity to not only contact the aliens, but to establish some kind of diplomatic relationship: "Hey, don't hurt us and we won't bother you". Trade - The one thing humans and Americans are good at is trying to find the right edge to trade, barter, buy, or sell. The US will scramble to find something that the aliens want, but cannot get themselves or don't want to. Who knows, maybe they like sea-shells, but can't be a$$ed to collect them themselves (okay that was a throwaway example, but you know what I mean). Espionage - No doubt a decision will be made to gather information discreetly, and likely this will end only in embarrassing the country. 

Yes. Write a letter to the future, put it in an envelope or box with the "Open on xyz date only." Set aside the envelope in a place where it will be undisturbed until that date. If it's a very distant future, engrave the message (maybe in multiple languages), with instructions on its care. 

(1) Texas. I have no problem imagining Texas seceding from the United States. Obviously the vast sentiment is against secession, while those that are for it are vociferous, and those that are against it, just think it's silly. The reasons for Texas' departure would be a strong economic connection with other countries, such as Mexico and the Gulf states; as well, there are romantic and prideful notions. Texas is also the second largest donor state, and would do well economically. (2) Alaska In addition to HDE's answer, with a relatively low population, and a very seasonal population, there's less chance of opposition to a strong movement. (3) Hawaii Hawaii receives a major source of their economy from on-land agriculture and tourism (from overseas as well). The great distance from the contiguous US makes it more convenient as well. It would have to be a peaceful secession, resulting in charging the US for keeping defense personnel and economy there; as well as commercial, etc. flights to/from the US; and trade for specialty items. (4) Washington, D.C. This would be interesting (being the capital and all). The city-state that is taxed, but with no representation in the United States Senate. Becoming an autonomous country, but holding the administrative functions of the US Government, would benefit them nicely, but I don't know how America will negotiate having their administrative center "overseas". WDC would not try anything daring, though, because they're almost totally landlocked by a very powerful country. They also have the highest revenue per capita of any of the "states;" they would do well to trade internationally and with America. (5) Red vs Blue As our country gets more politically polarized, the movement to secede becomes stronger and an alliance of some of the key states like Texas, Colorado, Arizona and the 'deep south,' results in negotiating a movement to secede. The states that are not "red states" or "blue states" but rely on more powerful states end up flipping to that color. For continuity and for that last sentence, I've made some changes and taken the liberty (ha, get it?) to adjust for you the United Divided States.
