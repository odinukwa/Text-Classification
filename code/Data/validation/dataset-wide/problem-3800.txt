For an $A_\infty$-category $\mathcal A$, one defines the group $K_0(\mathcal A)$ by $$K_0(\mathcal A) := \mathbb Z \operatorname{Ob} \operatorname{Tw} \mathcal A / \left<[A]+[B]-[C]\right>$$ Where 1) $Tw$ is the twisted complexes category (a way of formally adding all cones, see, $URL$ section 3.2 for an exposition by Auroux.) 2) The relations are $[A]+[B]-[C]=0$ when $C$ is quasi-isomorphic to a cone of a closed degree 1 morphism $A\to B$ Can one somehow relate $K_0(\mathcal A)$ to $K_0(Fun_{A_\infty}(\mathcal A, \mathcal A))$, i.e. the $K_0$ of the $A_\infty$-category of $A_\infty$-endofunctors? Thanks 

$\mathbb Z$ acts on the lattice $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ by adding an element to itself n times. I am studying some function arising from symplectic geometry which happens in my case to be naturally defined on $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ and is constant on each orbit of the $\mathbb Z$-action, thus it lives ob the orbit space. I am curious what kinds of algebraic/geometric/arithmetic structures does this set or orbits has, to compare with the behaviour of my function. Thanks 

Hello, I am looking for a source that discusses and teaches hyperbolic geometry from a synthetic approach (As opposed to the common analytinc approach in the poincare disk). I am looking for something more in spirit with eucld's elements or hilbert's geometry book. Thank you 

I am learning about Quantum Homology which I have to use in my research, and I see that in many papers (For example in FOOO, "Spectral invariants with bulk, Quasimorphisms and Lagrangian Floer theory", $URL$ the homology ring being computed is given in terms of a Superpotential function. I understand that the relations in the homology ring are somehow encoded in its derivatives, and that it's critical point somehow correspond to Toric fibers with non vanishing homology, but nothing more than that and I have no clue about the details. What I am looking for is some exposition on the subject, some lecture notes, or somewhere where I can see a simple example being calculated completely from scratch. Can anyone please refer me so such sources? Thank you 

It doesn't explain why he constructed such a thing. Apparently, there are Stiefel-Whitney invariants associtated to quadratic modules over $F$. Perhaps an example could be $\mathbb{Q}^2$ with the bilinar map $\langle x, y \rangle = x^2 + 11y^2$, but I'm not sure if class numbers are appropriate to discuss over $\mathbb{Q}$ (since they're usually over $\mathbb{Z}$). However, there are many nice $p$-adic invariants over rational quadratic forms. Even the trivial quadratic form $\mathbb{Q}^3$, with $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ it would be good to understand how strong approximation holds. But Milnor's invariants might not be relevant to any of that. Instead he shows us a way to get at the Galois group of the separable closure of $F$ (which I guess is smaller than the algebraic closure). $$ K_\ast F / 2 K_\ast F \simeq H^\ast ( G_F ; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}) $$ The K-groups of number fields, seem to encode some crucial information about algebraic numbers, but they way Milnor has written it just looks like a rather arbitrary linear map. 

While I was watching the news last month I realized the weather report was basically a discussion of solutions to PDE. In particular, I was paying attention to the hurricane season (which is not yet over) and the case of tropical cyclones. 

and I do not understand the downvoting since the equations I have written are accurate reflection of Mertens' theorem and Selberg's typo. 

For hyperbolic space we have various models due to Klein and Poincare such as a hyperboloid of one sheet or the disc model or the upper half plane. In anti-de Sitter space there is one more negative sign in the metric: $$ ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 - dt_1^2 - dt_2^2 $$ I'd call this $ \mathbb{R}^{2,2}$ or something. Is there still a separation between time-like and space like geodesics now? Possibly: $$ ds^2 = \frac{1}{y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 - dt_1^2 - dt_2^2 \right) $$ Is there an analogue of the upper half-planes and are the geodesics still semi-circles there? 

Let $F$ be a number field, and $S$ be a non-empty finite set of places of $F$. Suppose that for each $v\notin S$, we have a character $\chi_v$ of $F_v^\times$ (for my purpose, we can require that $\chi_v$ is quadratic). Moreover we suppose that $\chi_v$ is unramifiedd for almost all $v\notin S$. Is it possible to find a global Hecke character $\chi$ of $\textbf{A}_F^\times$ such that for all $v\notin S$, the local component of $\chi$ is exactly $\chi_v$? If $S$ has a single element $v_1$, I think this is possible by the following simple construction. For $a\in F^\times$, define $$\chi_{v_1}(a)=\prod_{v\ne v_1}\chi_v(a)^{-1},$$ and then extend $\chi_{v_1}$ to $F_{v_1}^\times$ by density. According the comments given by @znt this is false. Now my question is: is there any reasonable conditions on $\chi_v$ for $v\notin S$ such that this is true? If this is not suitable for this site, I will delete it. Any help will be appreciated. 

In their paper "Uniqueness of linear periods", Compositio Mathematica, $\textbf{102}$ (1996), 65-123, Jacquet and Rallis asked the following question in the middle of page 67. Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field, and $n$ be a positive integer. Let $H_0=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&\\ &a \end{pmatrix},a\in GL_n(F)\right\}\subset GL_{2n}(F)$. Given an irreducible smooth representation of $GL_{2n}(F)$, if $\textrm{Hom}_{H_0}(\pi,1)\ne 0$, could we conclude that $\pi$ is self-contragredient? If $n=1$, it is well-known that the answer is yes. How about the general case? What is the current status of this problem? 

Let $G$ be a reductive group defined over a field $F$. Let $\Sigma$ be the set of roots of $G$ with respect to a Borel subgroup $B=TU$ with torus $T$. Let $W=N_G(T)/T$ be the Weyl group of $G$. For $\alpha\in \Sigma$, let $U_\alpha$ be the root space of $\alpha$. Denote $x_\alpha:F\rightarrow U_\alpha$ the fixed isomorphism. Let $\alpha\in \Sigma$ be a root, and $w\in W$ be a Weyl element such that $w(\alpha)=\alpha$. My question is: is it true that $w$ has a representative $\dot w\in G$ such that $$\dot w x_\alpha(r)\dot w^{-1}=x_\alpha(r),\forall r\in F?$$ If this is false in general, in what cases it is true? Thanks in advance. 

I am reading Abouzaid's paper "A geometric criterion for generating the Fukaya category" ($URL$ and it is claimed there, without proof, in section C.4 in the appendix (pp.34) that the compactificaiton of the moduli space of holomorphic annuli is given by two discs meeting in an interior node at $R\to\infty$ and by two discs meeting at two boundary nodes at $R\to0$, where $e^R$ is the conformal parameter (i.e. annuli is given by $\{1\le|z|\le e^R\}$. I tried searching the literature for a proof, but other than finding the same claim in other papers I have found none. 1) Could someone please suggest a proof, or refer me to one? 2) Is there an explicit way to "calculate" the DM-compactification of a space of Riemann surfaces with boundary (and maybe marked points).? 3) While I can imagine the limit as $R\to\infty$ as a thin neck being developed, I am especially curious about the limit as $R\to 0$ as it seems somewhat arbitrary, why do only 2 chords shrink to a point? why not 1 or 3? Thank you! 

For a topological space M, It is known from homotopy theory that the elements of the first cohomology $H^1(M;\mathbb{Z})$ are in 1-1 correspondence with homotopy classes of maps $[M,S^1]$ In my case of interest M is a smooth manifold. Take $\alpha$ and take smooth $f\colon M \to S^1$ representing $\alpha$ under the above identification. My question is, under what (sufficient / necessary / equiv) conditions $f$ gives a locally trivial fibration (Fiber bundle) of M over $S^1$? I would prefer conditions in terms of homology / cohomology of M. What comes to my mind is that, according to Ehrshmann theorem, since $S^1$ is compact,this map is a fibration iff surjective + submersion. Surjectivity can be assured by picking nontrivial cohomology class. As for submersion. I have no idea how to characterize. Thanks 

As long as $f(s)$ is deterministic we have some back-of the envelope computations: \begin{eqnarray} \Delta \big(f(s) B_s\big) &=& f(s + \Delta s)B_{s + \Delta s} - f(s )B_{s} \\ \\ &=& \big[f(s + \Delta s) - f(s)\big]B_{s + \Delta s} - f(s) \big[ B_{s+\Delta s} - B_s\big] \\ \\ &=& \Delta f(s)\, B_{s + \Delta s} - f(s) \,\Delta B_s\end{eqnarray} Itô's formula is not goint to tell us anything new. It tells us very familiar things such as: $$ \int_o^t s \, dB_t = t\, B_t - \int_0^t B_s \, ds$$ More in Øksendal's book. 

I get thrown off because we way Riemann surface is just a polygon with edges glued together, and that's pretty much the picture of moduli space painted here. 

Their Gaussian integral the partition function of some 3D gauge theory with no mathematical definition, so I have no way of checking their conjecture for other maps. Are there conjectures of this kind on the math literature connecting Gaussians and hyperbolic maps? How do I get a formula to check for general maps in $\pi_1 (\mathbb{T}^2 \backslash \{ pt\})$ on the once-punctured torus. 

Partizan misere games have also been studied. See Misère canonical forms of partizan games. A misere game is where the last person to move loses rather than wins. 

Let $f(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ be a holomorphic function. The derivative should be the same regardless of how we should take the derivative. $$ \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(z + \Delta x)-f(z)}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(z + \Delta y)-f(z)}{i\Delta y} $$ Reading off the real and imaginary parts you obtain two different derivatives: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + i\, \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = -i\,\Big(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+ i\,\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \big)$$ We have put a complex structure on the flat plane $\mathbb{C}$. Why stop there? Let's set: $ dz = e^{i\theta} dx$ then: $$ \frac{df}{dz} = e^{-i\theta} \lim_{\Delta x \to 0}\frac{f(z + e^{i\theta}\Delta x) - f(z)}{\Delta x} = e^{-i\theta} \bigg( \cos \theta \frac{\partial }{\partial x} + \sin \theta\; i\,\frac{\partial }{\partial y} \bigg) \bigg( u + i\, v\bigg)$$ If you let $\theta = 0$ or $\theta = \pi/2$ or $\theta = \pi/3$ this is: $$ \bigg( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\bigg) = \bigg( -\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + i \,\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\bigg) = e^{-i\pi/3}\bigg(( \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}) + i (\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} )\bigg) $$ The algebra looks almost right.
