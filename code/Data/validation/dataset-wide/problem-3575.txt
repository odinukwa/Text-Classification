I'm going to tackle the issues of creatine timing, general eating, and bedtime eating separately. You should take your creatine sometime around when you work out, either before, after, or both. Bodybuilding.com offers a write-up about a study, and this study found some evidence pointing towards achieving better results when taking creatine after a workout, but the article highlights the fact that before or after is not of extreme importance. There is nothing explicitly wrong with taking your creatine before going to bed, but it appears to be causing problems for you, so I highly recommend moving your intake time. For your general eating, you should make a strong effort to space your meals out throughout the day, especially if trying to build mass. Your stomach problems could also be linked to eating too much in a short period of time at night, as going to a full state straight from a completely empty stomach state can cause issues. Eating right during the day will help you to avoid this problem of getting up at night for food. If you're waking up during the night, you are not getting the rest you need to recover, and are also setting yourself up for sleep problems by creating an unsustainable sleep cycle. While it may require setting alarms or some other measure, eating throughout the day is key. Before bed, if you want to eat something, ideally it should be something small with protein. It may be that the problems you are associating with protein are a result of overeating before bed, or, as you mentioned, the creatine. I recommend trying small snacks like slices of turkey, a glass of milk, or a greek yogurt before bed. If those continue to bother your stomach, I would switch to fruits or vegetables, and also see a doctor to try and identify any food allergies. As I mentioned, however, a pre-bed snack is not a necessity, and not eating post-dinner may help to rectify your issues. 

Either your shirt or the roller pad was probably protruding or got pinched between the sponge roller and your shoulder. Prevent this in the future by using a barbell without the sponge, without the manta pad, and without the Smith machine. 

Sometimes. Depends what kind of bodyweight training you're doing. Most of them you can progress along some measure. Nothing will ever match barbells in precision and flexibility of measuring progress. 

So you're almost, but not quite, at the point where orthodox SL says to do three work sets instead of five. (This change does not affect the warm-up sets.) But 3x5 is a fine program, and there's nothing wrong with switching now. Personally I like workouts that last 1.5 hours. However two hours can be draining, as can 5x5. In the past I've solved this by switching to 3x5 and/or further splitting the workouts, roughly like: 

I think the training variables you can control are intensity, volume, and muscles worked. Since increasing the intensity (and slightly changing the muscles worked, by changing the angle) didn't work, try increasing the volume even more. Try 3x20 at the easier angle, or 3x15 with 10-second holds at the top on the last rep, or every fifth rep. The other option, which I would try simultaneously to increased volume, is to get in as many reps as possible using the harder angle. If you have to do singles, do singles. If you have to rest five minutes between sets, OK. If you have to do partials or negatives, OK. As long as you're getting a solid base number of reps (at least 3x15) on the easier bar position, you'll be OK doing minimal volume with the harder version, which will help you get used to it. 

If you do the clean, stop and hold the position, then do the press, you will not see any advantage over entering that position directly. If you do the clean then transition directly into the press, however, you may see an increase in the amount you can lift, but this will be due to using the momentum of the clean for your lift. The same stationary position will take the same amount of force, regardless of how you got there. I recommend trying for some higher weight presses by doing cleans first, and carefully keeping track of the set position the clean brings you to. If you can do more weight by cleaning first, it is likely you need to shift your normal press starting position to the position you reach from cleaning. 

Run. Keep running. Run again. Run again. Run again. With your prior running experience, you'll likely be surprised at how quickly you're able to return to running, even with your current state. It'll be tough the first couple weeks, but (especially with the past experience) you'll be able to reach a point where a slow jog feels easy. This slow jog has a comparable exertion level to hiking; the easier you can make jogging, the better your vacation in the mountains will go. Gaining proficiency with other cardio exercises would also help, but running will provide the most benefits, both because it targets the same muscles as hiking and because you've done it before. A few weeks of running can dramatically change how light you feel on your feet; this change will help both physically and mentally. As for how to start running again, take it slow. It's important not to try to reach too far and disappoint yourself. The feeling of wanting more after a short run is dramatically more beneficial than detesting the activity after a failed longer run. The exact distance to start with really depends on how out of shape you are, but trying for 20% of the distance you used to do, and at a slower pace, should work well. The next day, if 20% felt good, try 30%, or do 20% at a faster pace. Work your way up this way, keeping the running doable. As I mentioned before, you'll likely be surprised at how quickly you can get back into shape. 

My fix for this is to concentrate on pushing through my heels. If there are no physiological barriers then this should be enough. One way I help concentrate on pushing through my heels is to pick up my big toes and keep them elevated for the entire set. I stand and squat normally, but my big toes stay off the ground (even if they're in my shoe). 

From page 102. The position that the function of the abdominals is not solely to curl the torso forward and in, but rather primarily to provide isometric contraction for postural support, is the key. Many people note that the abdominals are quite necessary for bracing the torso during heavy lifting, for example, pulling movements deadlifts, cleans, and snatches, as well as squats and overhead work like presses and jerks. There are many supporting reasons: crunches provide very little resistance, they often dovetail into a mistaken belief in spot reduction, or their use signals a misguided priority of developing a six-pack without attention to fundamental strength, conditioning, and mobility. However those reasons are secondary to the central claim that the abdominals are primarily useful for bracing the trunk to resist movement (whether under a barbell or to maintain good posture during normal daily activities), rather than flexing the torso in order to move a load. 

One of the users I spoke with benches 450+, and he said he doubted the product at first, but then stated that it allowed him to work through a shoulder injury which had limited him to reps at 225. Assuming that this band strategy is as effective as the slingshot, I would say that it makes sense for use when dealing with heavy reps, especially when recently injured, but in other scenarios may unnecessarily change parts of the motion. 

In addition, there are a number of strategies you can follow which, while not eye exercises, will make a day of looking at a screen far easier on your eyes. (same sources) 

Fat loss will come from eating less calories you consume, and the easiest way to create a deficit is through your diet. The biking is a great supplementary activity, but it will be extremely difficult to add mileage or begin additional jogging without consuming more calories to make up for those activities. Adjusting your diet while maintaining your current physical activity means you know eating less than you currently are will produce a deficit; if you add in additional exercise, the uncertainty of the correct amount to eat will make losing weight more difficult (Increasing mileage and decreasing food intake will work if you can manage it, but I've found it to be very difficult to maintain). In regards to how to change your diet, yes, eliminating cheese would likely get you to the necessary caloric deficit, but it is not the only way to get to this point. Besides the cheese, everything you are eating looks healthy, but healthy food items still have calories. If you don't want to cut out cheese completely, try limiting slightly the amount of the other foods you eat. With a caloric deficit, you may indeed feel a constant hunger, but over time you will adjust, and when you first begin to observe a difference in your body, fighting the hunger pangs will be that much easier. In terms of how much to cut out in calories, dropping ~300 a day to start should feel somewhat OK, and as you adjust to that you can work on taking that number down further, with an end goal of 2000 or so total calories (based on your body type). And yes, biking is cardio, unless you've set the resistance far too high :) 

Yes. If you can't hold something, you can't pick it up. Rippetoe & Kilgore in Starting Strength mention that there is also an unconscious feedback effect, where if one's grip starts to fail, the rest of the body refuses to lift properly: 

So doing "StrongLifts" without squats is out of the question. She can do a linear progression on everything else if she wants. Substitutes You could have her do goblet squats until she gets her big girl pants on and realizes that real squats are what strong and healthy people do. Not everybody has to do a 3-times-a-week back squats in order to live their life healthfully. (But it sure helps.) Sometimes just "not weak" is enough. Goblet squats can do that. Unfortunately, they might trigger the same danger signals she has for barbell squats. Lunges would be great. Here's what I'd try: have her do lunges with dumbbells--heavy dumbbells, no five pound BS--and stick with that for a few workouts. Increase the weight as possible. If she's okay with that after a few weeks, spring this question on her: why is bending her knee for a lunge safe, but bending her knee for a squat dangerous? If someone is convinceable, that should work. If they're not, well, fine. We must open our arms to the gentle indifference of the world. Air squats, adding weight at an imperceptible pace with the wimpy dumbbells until she's doing real work, might weasel past her anti-squat defenses and get her to do real work. It's worth a try. But it's very possible that she'll reject these and all other fruitful substitutes for barbell back squats (e.g. pistol squats, Bulgarian split squats, front squats...). The problem is that for the substitute to work, it needs to bend the knees deeply. Since she's terrified of using her knees for the purpose which they evolved for--bending deeply--it's kind of a problem. So we might not be able to substitute anything for squats. Alternatives So now we're not doing StrongLifts, and we're not squatting or lunging. What are we left with in a world without squatting? Lift heavy some other way. Focus on deadlifts, heavy presses, and getting to a set of real pull-ups. Lift heavy. Drag a sled and sprint. Maybe throw in a couple farmer's walks--as heavy as humanly possible--since you have time in your workout now that squats are forbidden. Lift heavy. Linear progression is king, but if someone is scared of squatting I have doubts that they'll add five pounds to their bench press every session. It might be necessary to scale back the progression to add weight every other workout or even less frequently. You'll never replace the squats, but if she lifts heavy in every other way, it probably won't be a big deal. 

It sounds like your in a tough situation with doctors, so I'll suggest some options, but keep in mind that if you get the chance to see another doctor you should do so. I've never suffered from anxiety attacks, but I do have exercise induced asthma, and before my diagnosis had some pretty scary situations where I couldn't breathe. For me, the best response to an attack was to try and calm down; I understand that's likely not possible with an anxiety attack. Therefore, the best way you'll be able to improve your response is by strengthening your general ability to breathe, as this will translate into a somewhat easier time dealing with an attack. Breathing Exercises Web MD offers two examples of breathing exercises, both centered around breathing in through the nose and out through the mouth in specific intervals. You can customize a breathing program to what you feel comfortable with; almost any sort of structured practice will hold benefits. Depending on how you feel with these sorts of programs, you could move on to longer intervals, and over time work to increase the amount of time you can hold your breath. Exercises like these will increase the confidence you have in your breathing, and will make it easier to find air during those periods of anxiety. Aerobic Exercise This type of exercise, in the long run, holds more benefits, but is also more difficult to do due to your breathing difficulties. If you're worried about experiencing an inability to breathe during exercise, stick to the breathing exercises until you're more comfortable. Once you're able to do aerobic exercises, start slowly, keeping your heart rate <120bpm. As you grow comfortable with that level of exercise, you can work on increasing intensity, but always make careful note of how you feel breathing, and don't push things too far. In the long run, exercise will help make breathing easier, and will lessen the difficulties you feel during an anxiety attack. As I mentioned at the beginning, these are suggestions from an athlete, not a doctor, and if you can you should definitely seek out a second opinion. If you have asthma or a breathing condition, the correct medicine will be orders of magnitude more effective than the strategies I listed. Best of luck. 

I've seen gyms with bumper plates and a lifting platform, clearly designed and intended for standard Olympic weightlifting style drops from chest or overhead, next to a sign saying that one should always configure the safety bars so that the bar doesn't hit the ground. This would of course damage the bar, make a tremendous amount more noise, and increase danger to the lifter. What I'm trying to say is that gym rules don't necessarily make any sense. It's perfectly reasonable to drop a bumper-plate-loaded Olympic bar from chest or overhead in a controlled manner while using an Olympic platform: guiding it down with the hands, making sure it doesn't bounce into the wall, and so on. That doesn't mean everyone at the gym will understand or accept this normalcy. It may even be technically and bizarrely against the rules at your gym. Whether or not it's rude is determined by how knowledgeable your fellow gym-goers are with Olympic lifting, which is to say that it defies all reason and pattern. The guy who doesn't unload his bench press, loudly sings along to his earbuds, curls in the squat rack, steals people's weights while they sit and rest for thirty seconds between sets, and gets his sweat all over the floor might consider it rude for you to drop a 1RM snatch or bail out of a failed max clean & jerk. C'est la vie. Dropping a bar only becomes problematic when it is excessive or unnecessary. Letting go of every deadlift, including warm-up sets, is one example. Dropping a light overhead press is another. Slamming or pushing the bar to the floor in celebration is another. Dropping the bar should be done because it wouldn't be safe for the lifter to do otherwise, which is common in Olympic lifting and occasionally with other lifts. Dropping a bar to avoid the increased soreness that comes with lowering it as well as raising it is a fuzzy area that should take into account the disruption to one's fellow gym mates, but dropping a bar for safety is just something people should get used to as part of being in a place where weights get lifted overhead. 

You could likely see greater improvements by moving your HIIT workout to before your long run, and by shortening your HIIT intervals. Moving the HIIT training to before the longer run will allow you to attack it with a greater intensity, which works well, as intensity is the key component of the HIIT strategy. A 50 minute run at 8.5mph is tiring for the vast majority of people, and afterwards it will be difficult to fully commit to sprints. Moving the longer run to the end will also serve as a good cool-down for your body. Shortening your HIIT intervals will also allow you to increase your intensity, as your can run faster for a shorter period of time. Start off with something like 20 seconds on, 40 seconds off x 10 and aim for a pace of 15mph or so (if your treadmill doesn't go this high, you may want to consider moving to a track). If this feels easy, try bringing it up to 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off x 10, or try increasing your speed. Keeping a shorter interval will allow you to push harder on each effort, and will maximize your benefits from HIIT. If you do decide to make the switch to an outdoor track, it will be far easier to divide the intervals by distance than by time. Instead of 30 seconds, you could run for 200 meters; you may also find it's easier to push yourself when running for distance, as "the faster you run, the quicker you're done". 

You're not giving much detail here, but more food, particularly more protein, would almost certainly help. To recap: to grow muscle, you need to lift heavier weights, stop doing stuff that doesn't help, and eat more. 

"Beginner gains" is a useful abstraction for what I conjecture is an interrelated set of physiological processes. Part of it is the systemic hormonal response to the first time someone does resistance training, part of it is easy improvements to neurological efficiency (i.e. you get better at the movement, so can lift more weight independent of your theoretical maximum muscular strength), part of it is the absence of psychological or physical set points for what constitutes heavy weight. But since the term is just a phrase to refer to what is really multiple complex processes, it's important not to investigate it as its own entity. If someone starts training and does a lot of upper-body pushing and pulling, they'll get really good at that and their upper body will see improvements in strength, muscle size, and so on. But there will also be system-wide changes caused by that upper-body work: one's metabolism and hormone profile will change, the lower body and trunk will get stronger due to incidental bracing and stabilization work. So the lower body is already seeing improvements without doing any direct work. This is the source of the old adage that an untrained person's bench press can be improved by having them do long-distance cycling--and vice versa. The body adapts specifically to imposed demands, but the imposed demands of cycling include things related to the bench press, and the imposed demands of bench press include things related to the squat. So when that same upper-body-trained person starts to squat, they will already have the benefit of some "beginner gains", but some other yet-untapped "beginner gains" will be triggered by their new training. They will progress quickly because their legs/posterior chain's neurological efficiency is quite low and ready for quick improvement, and because they may see another systemic response to this new training demand. The effects will not be as dramatic as if they started squatting when they first started training, but I have not seen much evidence that there are any effects of this beginner phase that are not replicable later on. Regarding linear progression: this technique works in so many situations that it's ridiculous to say that someone should avoid it. It should be the first tool one reaches for when starting a new lift, if only to find the right place to start periodization for that lift.
