Furthermore, Sunday working seems to have been unusual for men working in the production of sheet steel until some time after 1895. Only the Edgar Thompson plant (owned by Carnegie) had always operated during a portion of Sunday, and we are told that Sunday working had been abandoned at Homestead in 1882 [Ibid p168]. Thus, for Andrew Carnegie's workers in this part of the steel industry, the working week seems to have been six eight-hour shifts, or 48 hours, working from Monday to Saturday from 1885 to 1892. The situation was to change dramatically following the Homestead strike! 

Even if some of these were just Nero taking the opportunity of settling scores (as is suggested by Tacitus), this was a large-scale conspiracy that included popular Senators, senior military figures and individuals with privileged access to the emperor's person. It has rightly been described as "The beginning of the end for Emperor Nero" (albeit with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight). The very existence of the conspiracy weakened the emperor's position. What Nero could not afford was a series of public trials that could inspire further opposition. It has to be said that we do not know exactly how many of the 19 who paid the ultimate price in the aftermath of the conspiracy were actually ordered to commit suicide. In the case of Piso himself, we do know that he was ordered to commit suicide by Nero. As Vasily Rudich puts it: 

As for your first question, I can't offer a figure for a modern art student, but the PBS documentary Secrets of The Dead: China's Terracotta Warriors shows the process carried out by teams of skilled replica makers in China. It took about a month to complete a single figure based on a normal modern working week. (I think this may be the documentary mentioned by @SJuan76. I'm pretty sure it's available on YouTube). 

Interestingly, it has been known that people in Ancient Egypt were not forced to follow the occupations of their fathers since the early nineteenth century. Writing in 1836, J. Gardner Wilkinson observed: 

Therefore, assuming that Hamilton was actually the father of his son, and that his son was actually the father of John C. A. Hamilton (i.e. no 'non-parental events' occurred), the Y-chromosome evidence recorded by the study is essentially identical to the chromosome Hamilton inherited from his father (whoever his father actually was). The results of that study are presented and discussed by the project co-ordinator Gordon Hamilton. The page includes a link to the data underpinning their results and discussion, presented in tabular form. Now, two participants of that study inherited haplogroup E which: 

We add the extra "e"s to make it pronounceable. This isn't just a wild guess though. In the Greco-Roman period, stelae were often carved in multiple languages (typically, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Greek, although they could also be incised with a demotic version of the text). The best known example of this is, of course, the Rosetta Stone. Also, the Coptic language is a descendent of the ancient Egyptian language, so we have some guidance there. Additionally, names were often recorded in the records of other societies. They wrote them phonetically, as they heard them, and so are a good guide to how the Egyptians pronounced those names. A good case-in-point here is the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. His name was usually written as: 

Of course, he was talking about walled cities, but the principle remains true today. The terrain in cities favours the defenders. That said, you have named a number of significant urban battles in your question, although I wouldn't agree with your assessments of most of them. The Battle of Aachen, for example, was certainly not the walkover that you seem to think it was. Similarly, the fact that X Corps suffered over a thousand casualties during the Second Battle of Seoul indicates that US forces were far more involved in the battle than your question suggests. Perhaps a good starting point might be for you to read Alec Wahlman's Storming the City: US Military Performance in Urban Warfare from World War II to Vietnam (2015). He focuses on four urban battles between World War II and Vietnam (Aachen (1944), Manila (1945), Seoul (1950), and Hue (1968)), and examines each battle in some detail. Of particular interest in Wahlman's book is the operational context of each of the battles (too many texts seem to describe battles as if they occurred in splendid isolation). 

It is certainly true that many of the foundations for later civilisations, like the development of agriculture, the development of writing, and even an invention of the wheel, can be traced to The Fertile Crescent. It is likely that many of the ancestors of modern Kurds came from the the Fertile Crescent. It is quite possible that "The land of Karda", mentioned on a Sumerian clay-tablet from the 3rd millennium BC is the earliest reference to a "Land of the Kurds". If so, the Kurds might have originated from an area to the south of Lake Van. However, we must remember that the development of agriculture was perhaps some 5000 years before the development of writing. Any suggested link between a possible Sumerian mention of a "Land of the Kurds" and the people that invented agriculture 5000 years before is tenuous at best. So we can reasonably say that the ancestors of modern Kurds came from an area within the Fertile Crescent, although - based on recent DNA analysis - we can probably say the same for many of the ancestors of peoples from Europe, North Africa and a large part of Asia. We can also say that many of the foundations of civilisation were developed in the Fertile Crescent. But it would be going too far to claim that any one of the groups of people in that region "started civilisation". 

There is a really handy website for understanding Archaic Medical Terms, Diseases and Causes of Death. I often recommend it to genealogists who are confused by these terms on old records. Also, an interesting paper on causes of death in Bills of Mortality is John Graunt on Causes of Death in the City of London 

Although amusing to modern readers, this would have been intended to turn an evil omen - stumbling while disembarking from the boat - into a more favourable one. 

The biographies of H.P Lovecraft all indicate that his education was interrupted by periods of illness. Also, as @T.E.D. noted above, he lived his entire life in the northeast United States, and probably had limited opportunities for interaction with non-English speakers. Although I haven't been able to locate any document that explicitly states that Lovecraft was monolingual, I was able to locate references to a letter written by Lovecraft to Robert E. Howard, dated 29 March 1933, in which he states: 

tl;dr Why didn't Roman emperors restructure or dismantle the Praetorian Guard? Several tried. It didn't end well for them. Most paid for the attempt with their lives. 

Seti I is shown on the left as Osiris (Egyptian wsir) and carries the usual symbols of authority - the crook and the flail. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this image is the composite crown that SETI is wearing. This, together with the ram's horns, shows that the deceased King was being given the attributes of the god Amun-Ra in addition to those of Osiris. Thoth is actually dressed as priest in this instance. He is standing before Seti and holding the Ankh or "Key of Life" to the nose of the deceased King, so giving him life in the afterlife. In his other hand, Thoth is holding the lily and papyrus 'wands' of Upper and Lower Egypt (in this case, you can see the heads of the plants more clearly in the drawing than the photograph). Gods and goddesses are often portrayed carrying these, and they had a particluar significance in Egyptian 'magic'. Around the wands are twined Uraeuses which in turn wear the Red Deshret crown of Lower Egypt and the white (actually painted yellow) Hedjet crown of Upper Egypt, once again symbolising the unified kingdom of Egypt. 

That's an interesting question. When India first gained independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947 it was as The Dominion of India, with King George VI as king and Head of State. India became a sovereign democratic republic when the Constitution of India came into force on 26 January 1950. This repealed the Indian Independence Act, and removed the king as head of state. The Constitution of India was drafted by the Constituent Assembly of India, which, in turn, was elected by elected members of the provincial assemblies. So it wasn't the UK that allowed India to be a republic, it was the elected representatives of the Indian people themselves who chose to be a democratic republic. At the 1926 Imperial Conference, Britain and its dominions had agreed they were: 

I think you are right. It probably is the first historical example of conurbation, subject to an important caveat: The merge has to involve large towns or cities before it's considered to be conurbation. There were almost certainly earlier merges of smaller settlements - villages or hamlets combining to form small towns etc., but for the purpose of the definition, these don't count as conurbation. Uruk is certainly one of the earliest cities. As you say, Georges Roux observed that it was formed by the coalescence of the towns of Kullaba and Eanna. I don't think any of the other early cities developed from the conurbation of two earlier large settlements. So yes, based on that, Uruk is the first historical example of conurbation. 

Quoted in Richard I by John Gillingham, Yale, 2002, p222 Philip could now argue that Richard was no longer on crusade (even though he had not returned to his own realm), and that the church's protection of his lands no longer applied. 

Now, Personally I don't know whether these groupings are generally agreed, or whether there is some dispute. That is not the point. The point is that these groupings are accepted as ethnic groups by at least some people using that definition. Furthermore, by that definition conflict between these group is ethnic conflict, and Lord Ashdown's categorisation would seem reasonable.
