It seems everyone I know has a love/hate relationship with them.In other words liked it or didn't.My main complaint was while trying to maintain a consistant cadence I could feel the seat height changing.It seemed to interfere with my pedal stroke.Mine was an inexpensive telescope type,with no adjustments.My reccomendation would be stay away from the lowend models.Also I would try it in similar conditions prior to your trip. 

The level of expertise required will vary by the brand and the complexity of the bike. You will need a decent set of Allen wrenches and common hand tools such as wrenches and screwdrivers. I've assembled numerous bike for friends from a variety of sources. The easiest involved installing the front wheel, inserting the seat post, mounting the pedals and handlebars. Another required mounting the rotors to the wheels, the calipers to the frame, both wheels, bars and saddle. Then it also required some shifter and derailleur adjustment. I would suggest reading some of the Park Tool tutorials. Pay particular attention to derailleur and brake adjustments. While it is not rocket science it can be frustrating the first time you do it. If the bike comes out of the box really out adjustment and your attempt to correct it is unsuccessful then bring it to your Local Bike Shop and pay for the adjustments. 

I would try the warranty route first as @Carel suggested. It is possible that the movement has done enough damage that repair is not possible. I would consult a shop that specializes in Carbon Frame repair. They may be able to reaffix the threaded insert into the arm. As carbon parts are becoming more common repair of what used to unrepairable parts is also becoming more common. 

The "filth" is a composite material. It is a mixture of chain lube, road grit, and the metal filings from gear and chain wear. The road grit is composed of sand, tire bits, asphalt, trash, etc. The issue is when you mix them all together it forms a thick, pasty sticky mess.. The goop tends to collect more material. The grit in the sticky residue acts like sandpaper accelerating wear. You can minimize but not eliminate it by using the correct lube. This generally means a dry type lube when the conditions are dry and a wet lube when the conditions are wet. 

If you have correctly tightened the crank bolt then this normal. The recommended torque spec is 305-390 in lbs. If the crank axle came all the way to the end you would run the risk of the bolt bottoming out before the crank was seated. 

Look at the sidewall of the tire if it is marked front or rear the tire is designed with a specific position in mind. It may also include rotational direction arrows. Without any marking I assume it is a multidirectional and multiposition tire. 

The picture appears to show a cover over the access hole in the crank arm. Remove the cover by either unscrewing it of prying off the crank arm. Inside you should find a flanged nut. Wipe any grease or grit off the shaft Install the crank arm in the correct orientation onto the shaft. Tighten the nut with a socket (usually a 14mm) to between 300 and 400 inch pounds. Reinstall the dust cover. 

The photos I have seen on line indicate this bike lacks a frame mount for the rear brake caliper. The fork also lacks a mount. It will be most likely be cost prohibitive to attempt modifying the frame. You would need road specific disc calipers if you will be using drop bars, a disc wheelset, rotors, and cables as the old ones will likely be too short. If you are unhappy with the stopping ability the money would be better spent on quality brake pads. 

Try a Park DT-2 rotor tool or something similar.I've used a large adjustable wrench with mixed results.Usually the larger the clearance between the pads and rotor the more forgiveing it will be to the rotor being a little off.I leave the wheel mounted,spin it to find the high spot .Then tighten the wrench on to the rotor and flex gently to straighten the rotor. 

Try a local hobby shop.They usually sell remote control cars,planes etc. Look for model paints that are enamal.Testors is a popular brand in the U.S.They have sets of different colors along with single jars.You can custom mix the colors to get a match,say three drops of blue to one drop of black.I paint my test samples on an old piece of ceramic tile,dry them with a hairdryer to speed things up and check the match in direct sunlight.If the color is off scrape the sample off with a razorblade and adjust your mix and try again.Once you get a match write down the formula for the next time. 

Since you provided only a photo of the non drive side it is difficult to say for sure how many spacers you need. The number of spacers will vary with bottom bracket width and derailleur type. The spacer is needed to apply the preload on the bottom bracket bearings. This requires that the crank arm be butted up against the bearing. Then the plastic nut in the center of the arm must be tightened to 4-6 inlbs. The crankset should have come with 3 spacers. I strongly suggest you check either the Park Tool or Shimano website for step by step installation instructions for your particular set-up. 

I have had a similar problem and solved it by using a small piece of foam pipe insulation. I see no reason why a piece of sponge or similar material wouldn't work. I used two zip ties to hold the spacer in place, then positioned the sensor pick-up. 

If you have an old inner tube available cut a section slightly longer than your seatpost. Slip it over the seat post and zip tie it in place. It will act as a somewhat water/dirt resistant boot, similar to what mountain bikes have on the front shocks. You may have to look for a fairly wide tube to fit over the post. Check with your local shop to see if they have any unrepairable ones left laying around. 

I reference to djangodudes answer the 12 inch rule works fine, but I would avoid a tape measure,use an inexpensive steel ruler.If you must use a tape, measure from the 12 inch mark to the 24 inch mark.Doing this eliminates using the hook at the end of the tape which can have movement that will skew your measurement 

You may want to contact them to see if they have changed their design. I am currently using a PG 850 on a six speed. I seem to remember when I bought it, that it was labeled as a 6,7,8 speed and at the time the 9 speed was unique. Perhaps they have made changes to make it a more popular 7,8,9. 

You will need a specialty tool referred to as a crank remover or crank extractor. A Park Tool CCP22 or something similar. I would suggest considering the Park Tool CWP7 or equivalent as it offers increased flexibility. While the CCP22 is suggested for square shaft interface the CWP7 will do square, splined and octolink. While you only need the square type now the universal design of the CWP7 may come in handy later. 

Do not ride until you have inspected it. I would suggest that you remove the tire and inspect the inside in the area in question. If there are no areas of dryrot or damage you're ok to use it providing the bead is fully seated. Also check to see if a twist or kink in the wire bead may be the cause of the bubble. As long as the bead seats correctly on the rim a little kink won't hurt anything. 

While the Park Tool is the ideal tool, it is sort of a one trick pony. Meaning using it for anything other than cable housing and inners will likely damage it. I use a Dremel (brand name for an electric die grinder). With an abrasive cut-off wheel it makes quick, clean cuts. The multiple accessories make it more versatile for about the same cost. 

I would not use any type of tarp or cover this would increase the surface area and increase drag and the flapping tarp will damage the paint.I would remove the wheels stow them in the vehicle,again to reduce the frontal area.My experience has been that very aerodynamic vehicles are much more sensitve to drag ,they get high mpg by being moving air over the body very effiencently any disruption makes the smaller engines work that much harder. 

There are some designs that shoulder better than others. The slope of the top tube plays a big part in how well it carries. The greater the slope the smaller the triangle and the more difficult it is to get your arm between the frame. If you notice cyclocross frames have a near horizontal top tube. Shouldering the bike is an established part of the race. Looking at images of Hardrocks the toptube has a decent slope so my guess is it will never be comfortable to carry. You could try rigging a shoulder strap from the saddle to the stem. You will still have to deal with the nose of the saddle hitting you in the back. 

The frame design dictates caliper placement. In your case the mount is between the seat and chain stays. You are correct that the more common method is to run the brake cable along the top tube and down the seat stay. This allows for fewer and less sharp bends in the cable. Running the cable along the toptube and down the seatpost to the chainstay will incorporate two severe bends in the cable. An alternative to this is to run the cable along the front down tube over the bottom bracket along the chain stay. The cable length will be longer than the original but it will minimize the number of bends. You will most likely have to purchase some additional cable stops/brackets for the downtube and the chainstay 

If you have an unneeded old wheel laying around, use a spoke nipple. Remove the nipple from the spoke slide it over the cable and crimp with pliers. 

With out a photo it is hard to tell. Jagwire does make inline adjusters. They have different types, that adjust differently. Check the Jagwire website or ask at the LBS where you got the bike for assistance. 

If the crank arm is wide enough it may be drilled and a thread repair insert installed or tapped to a larger size. This is best left to your local bike shop. To buy the tools that you will most likely only use once will exceed the labor fee they will charge. They can also check to make sure the repair can be done safely. 

If you still have your old bike grab a tapemeasure and take a few measurements. Start with center of the pedal to top of the saddle while the crank arm is aligned with the seatpost. If your new bike is shorter and the seatpost is at the max look for a 400mm or longer post to get more leg extension. because of the seatpost angle this will push you back away from the bars. Measure from the back of the saddle to the center of the bars. This will give you some idea how far you need to as @Glenn suggests extend the stem or increase seatpost setback. With a few measurements you will save time and aggravation of installing stems and bars and being unsatisfied with the fit. This wont be exact but will get you closer than just quessing how much you need to extend. 

This is a very doable project. However, the cost benefit will vary. You need to be very sure of what parts will be reusable. If you are going to pay your local shop to do the work then as @Eric Smekens has said, sell the old one and look for a bike that fits. If you are planning on doing it yourself it is an excellent way to learn how your bike works and how to do your own service. You must consider the cost of the special tools you'll need to buy, and if they will be used enough to justify the expense. Some cost considerations you may not have thought of. You may find some of the bearings serviceable, but not worth paying someone to reinstall them. Some parts may need to be replaced because they won't fit the new frame. 

Some shops do offer a fit guaranty,it doesn't hurt to ask.Bring in your old saddle and explain to them what doesn't fit.They should be able offer suggestions.This is a classic case where spending a few extra bucks at the local shop can pay dividends later. 

Remove the valve cap With the lever folded flat against the pump insert the valve into the Schrader port of the pump Lift the lever so it is perpendicular to the pump body this will lock the pump and valve together Pump the pump until the tire feels firm Fold the lever against the pump body and quickly remove the pump from the valve Measure the pressure with a tire pressure gauge If the pressure is less than desired repeat steps 2 thru 5 If the pressure is above the desired pressure release some air and recheck it with the gauge As a side note the more you use the pump the closer you will be able to judge the pressure by the effort required to push the pump 

As @GaryRay has stated trainers are tough on tires. One condition that accelerates the wear is low pressure in the tire and high pressure on the roller. Many riders would not think of going for a ride without checking tire pressure but forget about checking the trainer tire. The low pressure on the tire and high roller pressure generates heat from the deflection of the sidewall as the wheel spins. the heat damages the tire. Also verify that the tire /wheel is as perpendicular to the roller as possible. 

If you feel this is a condition you will run into frequently consider a Pacsafe or similar device. Pacsafe or (an alternative brand) is a mesh bag made of steel cables. They are most commonly used by backpackers to secure their gear. You could insert you backpack into the bag and then secure it to your bike or the post, bike rack, tree etc that you are securing your bike to.
