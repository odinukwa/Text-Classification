Saturn is the most oblate planet in the solar system. If the equatorial diameter is $a$ and the polar diameter is $b$ then its oblateness, $(a-b)/a = 0.1$. We do not know the oblateness values for more than one or two exoplanets and even these are somewhat uncertain, but are thought to be lower than Saturn's value. For example $URL$ The oblateness of a star depends on the ratio of it gravitational acceleration to centrifugal acceleration at the equator. So the most oblate stars ought to be the ones with big radii and fast rotation rates (i.e. types of stars that would have low surface gravities if non-rotating). Giant stars come in two basic types - red giants, which are evolved intermediate and low-mass stars. These tend to be slowly rotating, though there is a class called FK Com variables which are fast-rotating red giants. The other class is the blue giants, which are high mass main sequence, or slightly evolved, stars. For maximum oblateness you want the star with the highest value of: $$ f = \frac{R \omega^2}{GM/R^2} = \frac{R^3 \omega^2}{GM}$$ where $M$ is the stellar mass and $\omega$ its angular velocity. Often we don;t know $\omega$, but can estimate the rotation velocity at the equator $v=R\omega$. Hence $$f = \frac{R^3 v^2}{GMR^2} = \frac{Rv^2}{GM}$$ A possible record holder is the O-type star VTFS 102 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This probably has a mass of $25M_{\odot}$ a radius of about $10R_{\odot}$ and has a measured rotation speed of $\geq 600$ km/s. Thus its value of $f$ is 0.75, compared with a value of $f=0.15$ for Saturn. EDIT: Due to Michael B - what about "millisecond" pulsars? The shortest periods are about 1.4 ms, the radii are about 10 km and the masses are likely to be about 1.4$M_{\odot}$. Do the sums and you find $f=0.1$. So, (at least in Newtonian mechanics) they should be no more oblate than Saturn. A further contender might by the dwarf planet Haumea that orbits at 40-50 au from the Sun. It is thought large enough to have achieved its shape via hydrostatic equilibrium between gravity and internal pressures (and rotation). Its mass is $4\times10^{21}$ kg, (mean) radius is 700 km and it has a rotation period of 3.91 hours. These numbers give $f=0.25$. It has been modelled using this, and matching its light curve, to be a triaxial ellipsoid (rather than oblate) with axis ratios 2 : 1.5 : 1 ($URL$ 

This is something that crops up a lot in Astrophysics and Astronomy, so here is the general approach. Get your equation into SI units. Thus $$M = \frac{5v^2R}{G} = 7.5\times10^{10} v^2 R,$$ with $M$ in kg, $v$ in m/s and $R$ in m. Now if you wish to replace $v^2$ by $(v/1000)^2$ (which is velocity expressed in km/s), you would simultaneously multiply the numerical constant at the front by $1000^2$. Similarly, to replace $R$ by $R/3.09\times 10^{22}$ (which is $R$ expressed in Mpc), then you have to multiply the numerical constant by $3.09\times10^{22}$ to leave everything unchanged. This then leaves your result still expressed in kg. To express it in solar masses, simply divide by a solar mass of $2\times 10^{30}$ kg. Thus $$\frac{M}{M_{\odot}} = \frac{7.5\times 10^{10}\times 10^6 \times 3.09\times10^{22}}{2.0\times 10^{30}} \left(\frac{v}{1 {\rm km/s}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{R}{1 {\rm Mpc}}\right)$$ $$\frac{M}{M_{\odot}} = 1.16\times10^{9} \left(\frac{v}{1 {\rm km/s}}\right)^2 \left(\frac{R}{1 {\rm Mpc}}\right)$$ Finally, check your result makes sense. Galaxy clusters are of order a Mpc in size, have velocity dispersions of hundreds of km/s and consists of hundreds of galaxies with total mass of $\sim 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ or so. This seems to check out - usually if a mistake has been made you will be many, many orders of magnitude out. 

Yes, there is a limit. If the radiation pressure gradient exceeds the local density multiplied by the local gravity, then no equilibrium is possible. Radiation pressure depends on the fourth power of temperature. Radiation pressure gradient therefore depends on the third power of temperature multiplied by the temperature gradient. Hence for stability $$ T^3 \frac{dT}{dr} \leq \alpha \rho g,$$ where $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the local gravity and $\alpha$ is some collection of physical constants, including how opaque the material is to radiation. Because there must be a temperature gradient in stars (they are hotter on the inside than the outside) this effectively puts an upper limit to the temperature. It is this that sets an upper limit of around 60,000-70,000 K to the surface temperature of the most massive stars, which are dominated by radiation pressure. In regions of higher density or higher gravity, radiation pressure is not such an issue and temperatures can be much higher. The surface temperatures of White dwarf stars (high density and gravity) can be 100,000 K, the surfaces of neutron stars may exceed a million K. Of course stellar interiors are much denser and consequently can be much hotter. The maximum temperatures there are controlled by how quickly heat can be moved outwards by radiation or convection. The very highest temperatures of $\sim 10^{11}$ K are reached at the centres of core-collapse supernovae. Ordinarily, these temperatures are unattainable in a star because cooling by neutrinos can carry energy away highly effectively. In the final seconds of a CCSn, the density gets high enough that neutrinos become trapped and so the gravitational potential energy released by the collapse cannot escape freely - hence the high temperatures. As to the last part of your question, yes there are astrophysical masers found in the envelopes of some evolved stars. The pumping mechanism is still debated. The brightness temperatures of such masers can be much higher than anything discussed above. 

The angular resolution of the telescope really has no direct bearing on our ability to detect Oort cloud objects beyond how that angular resolution affects the depth to which one can detect the light from faint objects. Any telescope can detect stars, even though their actual discs are way beyond the angular resolution of the telescope. The detection of Oort cloud objects is simply a question of detecting the (unresolved) reflected light in exactly the same way that one detects a faint (unresolved) star. Confirmation of the Oort cloud nature of the object would then come by observing at intervals over a year or so and obtaining a very large ($>2$ arcseconds) parallax. The question amounts to how deep do you need to go? We can do this in two ways (i) a back of the envelope calculation assuming the object reflects light from the Sun with some albedo. (ii) Scale the brightness of comets when they are distant from the Sun. (i) The luminosity of the Sun is $L=3.83\times10^{26}\ W$. Let the distance to the Oort cloud be $D$ and the radius of the (assumed spherical) Oort object be $R$. The light from the Sun incident on the object is $\pi R^2 L/4\pi D^2$. If we now assume that a fraction $f$ of this is reflected uniformly into a $2\pi$ solid angle. This latter point is an approximation, the light will not be reflected isotropically, but it will represent some average over any viewing angle. To a good approximation, as $D \gg 1$ au, we can assume that the distance from the Oort object to the Earth is also $D$. Hence the flux of light received at the Earth is $$F_{E} = f \frac{\pi R^2 L}{4\pi D^2}\frac{1}{2\pi D^2} = f \frac{R^2 L}{8\pi D^4}$$ Putting some numbers in, let $R=10$ km and let $D= 10,000$ au. Cometary material has a very low albedo, but let's be generous and assume $f=0.1$. $$ F_E = 3\times10^{-29}\left(\frac{f}{0.1}\right) \left(\frac{R}{10\ km}\right)^2 \left(\frac{D}{10^4 au}\right)^{-4}\ Wm^{-2}$$ To convert this to a magnitude, assume the reflected light has the same spectrum as sunlight. The Sun has an apparent visual magnitude of -26.74, corresponding to a flux at the Earth of $1.4\times10^{3}\ Wm^{-2}$. Converting the flux ratio to a magnitude difference, we find that the apparent magnitude of our fiducial Oort object is 52.4. (ii) Halley's comet is similar (10 km radius, low albedo) to the fiducial Oort object considered above. Halley's comet was observed by the VLT in 2003 with a magnitude of 28.2 and at a distance of 28 au from the Sun. We can now just scale this magnitude, but it scales as distance to the power of four, because the light must be received and then we see it reflected. Thus at 10,000 au, Halley would have a magnitude of $28.2 - 2.5 \log (28/10^{4})= 53.7$, in reasonable agreement with my other estimate. (Incidentally my crude formula in (i) above suggests a $f=0.1$, $R=10\ km$ comet at 28 au would have a magnitude of 26.9. Given that Halley probably has a smaller $f$ this is excellent consistency.) The observation of Halley by the VLT represents the pinnacle of what is possible with today's telescopes. Even the Hubble deep ultra deep field only reached visual magnitudes of about 29. Thus a big Oort cloud object remains more than 20 magnitudes below this detection threshold! The most feasible way of detecting Oort objects is when they occult background stars. The possibilities for this are discussed by Ofek & Naker 2010 in the context of the photometric precision provided by Kepler. The rate of occultations (which are of course single events and unrepeatable) was calculated to be between zero and 100 in the whole Kepler mission, dependent on the size and distance distribution of the Oort objects. As far as I am aware, nothing has come of this (yet).
