A 'bike computer' is a generic term for everything from a simple wheel sensor giving distance and speed, to an all singing all dancing computer that measure cadence, speed, altitude, heart rate, power and anything else you can think of A power meter measures the power you are outputting, and is one input into a bike computer. Power meters are expensive - a basic bike computer is less than $10, last I checked the cheapest power meter was worth more than my bike. They are also useless without a 'bike computer', but come with one - the computer with all the other sensors a typical bike computer has is the cheap bit. Power meters, like HR monitor in the 1990's are a great tool, but that is it, they are only a tool. Think of TV sales channeled selling fitness gear -'but wait, there's more.... You too can have a 6 pack and a gorgeous girl with just one ride a week with your power meter. *In conjunction with a nutrition program *Result will vary, Not all users will achieve the same outcomes shown in the advert.' If you don't know how to use them, have no interest in sports science and physiology and no desire to learn this stuff, they are expensive paper weights that slow you down. If you are prepared to learn and interpret the results they provide, they can be a great benefit. 

1) Yes, it is likely the problem 2). Aerosol Grease - comes out mixed with a volatile carrier that gets it in nearly as many places as the WD40 gets. Not as good as pulling apart and targeted greasing with small amounts in the right places as to be certain you have enough where its needed, you need a lot to go where it is not needed. Options are to do it as described, or pull the Brifter apart. What have you got to loose - you need new brifters if you don't try, or you try and it doesn't work. If you have a crack and it works, great. 

With young children is very rare for them to have the hand strength to cause a problem with brake strength. Their hands are small and weak, giving small reach hence low level action in the brake handle. Children bikes are built using cheap components (Even the components on the best children bike rate just above BSO adult bike components) The bikes for my boys (now 11 and 7) were always adjusted with both brakes giving maximum possible braking. I would be very surprised if a front brake being too tight would cause a crash, unless it was grabbing and not braking progressively. Further - the kind of crash needs to be considered. I would rather my boy went over the handle bars through too much brake force than under a car though not enough..... 

Virtually every mountain biker with more than a few years under there belt has exactly the same story. In my case, a sideways fall down a bank put me in hospital with a fractured wrist, after putting my arm out to break the fall... - not as bad as some, but still required a bit of titanium scaffolding to fix. The other option I had was a head-plant into a tree, so the wrist damage was, in hind site, the better outcome... Thats was 15 years ago - I still sh$# myself when riding along a narrow track with a big drop, but have no problems worrying about an "over the bars" falls and such things... As your prang was not too bad, you should be able to get over it - your subconscious mind has decided you might get hurt if you do that again, and is fighting against you doing it... You need to teach it that what you are doing is OK. The only way is to progressively build up from nearly identical, but easier situations. It will take time and effort. In my case, it now knows I am in charge, but still reminds me..... As always, when riding, theres no middle ground - you are doing it, or not. Give you subconscious mind any wiggle room, and it will make you back out. Once you have decided you are going to ride a section, only think positive thoughts about how to do it. "I need to ride the right track line" - not "Avoid the rut on the left" The subconscious does not understand negatives. Words like "Avoid", "Don't" and "Not" are ignored - A conscious thought "I must not hit that rock" becomes "I must hit that rock" to the subconscious- and guess what happens (Note: Some people don't agree how I separate out conscious and subconscious, and don't accept that subconscious has as much influence on what we do, however, it works for me to understand what going on in my head.....) 

As @Blam said - Your cadence is too low. When it comes to engines power = torque*revs. With cycling, torque is limited by bodyweight, but we do not limit power by limiting revs, which is why we (most of us except a few fashion mistakes) spend so much money and time on those exceedingly complex, fiddly and frustrating things called gears. Learn to rev faster - think F1 race car engine vs big block V8. Both output similar power, one does it by brute force, the other by high revs. Watch a few cycle races and see how fast they pedal, and notice how light weight most of the top riders are. 

Getting though all the hype and testosterone - Compact cranks allow a smaller small chain ring as they have a smaller BCD. Modern tech means you can have a wider gap between chain rings, giving larger spread. This means modern compact cranks with wide range 11 or 12 speed cassettes can get the same gear range and stepping as a triple 7 or 8 speed with just a double. Where you would switch to a compact is if you have decided you need a smaller chairing than will fit on a standard crank. However, you may still need a new Front derailleur and possibly a shifter. 

@Daniel has said it many times in this QA - The problem is the tire, not the tube. You need to remove any discussion of tube from this problem. Either tire is coming off the rim, or it has a hole in it big enough for the tube to balloon out. The most likely scenario is, as said by @Daniel, The tire bead is coming off the rim. This can happen if the tire is over inflated - too much pressure for it to hold together, under inflated while riding - rolling off the rim, The rim is damaged - visual inspection will confirm or if the tire bead is broken. If the pressure is correct (Below max printed on tire) and the rim not damaged, suspect the bead is broken and the tire needs to be replaced.
