They're often looking to see if you know how to use features of the language, or address corner cases with robust code. You'll sometimes get explicit instructions not to use certainly functions in the language because it defeats those goals. It'll show mastery and confidence if you say "I could just use x, but if you want to see how that works under the hood, you would do this..." and go on with the longer answer. That way you cover both methods. 

Take the job if offered. Leave when you need to. Interview in the new city now. Take a job if offered. Break the lease if you have to. If it's a big city, you can pretty easily sublet to minimize your expenses (or even turn a profit), and you can ask the new employer for relocation expenses--something you can't do if you move before looking for a job. This also gives you the flexibility of choosing a job before you choose a city. 

It's entirely normal for businesses to have billing errors caught in an audit that result in retroactive billing. It's also possible this will cause some hard feelings. As legitimate as the charge is, you have to weight the cost against your business. Is it worth cutting this discount to keep the customer? Waiving the retroactive pay may seem expensive, but you lose the customer, how much will that cost? Roughly speaking, you're looking at a 10% forgiveness, which is probably worth keeping the goodwill. You can cash in on that by letting the client know. That does two things--it lets you play the good guy for saving them money, and it lets them know you'll be charging for the meeting moving forward. 

This is unfortunately an issue of job portrayal. The best way to get substandard work is to advertise that the position is a stopgap to deal with a temporary situation. As a start, I'd clarify that the emergency stage is over. He's still going to be working some issues on the team, and that gives everyone the opportunity to start following some standard best practices from here on out, so the emergency situation doesn't arise again. This does a lot of work--it acknowledges his contributions while making it clear that the work was substandard, while allowing him to save face for having a perfectly valid reason to do shoddy work. It also places the blame for the emergency on shoddy work he didn't do. This will all establish that moving forward things are different and allow him to reset. Most importantly, it gives you the opportunity to mentor him on building code correctly. If you can do this without speaking with his boss, that's great. If you do need to bring him in the loop, I'd give the same narrative to the boss. Don't overreact to a perception that you're being devalued due to his performance. Then you're giving credit to the idea. It's normal in all parts of the organization to get rock stars who can do wonderful things until the whole project blows up because of work quality. Take the leadership role here and it's likely everyone will simply let you have it. 

It sounds like this place is a dog and a horrible long term investment--so focus on what you can get out of them before you leave. Focus on what do you need for your next job, so you don't repeat the mistake of winding up in a call center with a non-developer salary. Firstly, a developer title and clear developer responsibilities reporting through a development hierarchy will give you a much better resume. Get that, regardless. If not this place, then somewhere else, even as a junior developer. Secondly, focus your work on the tools and processes you need to succeed. Look at the jobs you'd like to have and do those things. It might not be the shortest path to success for your current employer--but consider what your new employer will want. Thirdly, get involved in the communities around those tools and processes. Get to know people working in places using these new tools. Lastly, worry about salary at your current job. You should only expect to move up so much in salary between jobs, so everything you get will multiply into your new position. Allow your current job to commit to your first goal, then press for more salary. If you ask for too much, they'll detract you from your other goals, which will kill your ability to pull in some real money. The real question isn't "How can I get more now?" It's "How can I quadruple my salary in the next 5 years." It won't be where you are. 

It's a common noob mistake to think that the people reporting to you have to do anything you say, ever. The worst you can do is fire them, and then where are you? They don't care about your job and what you need, any more than you care about the needs of a stranger living 3 blocks away. Sure, you don't wish that stranger any harm, but their specific needs don't often enter into your thoughts. There is a long literature by successful people that discusses how to motivate people to act on behalf of the project, and to take ownership of the team's success. Brow-beating, threats, intimidation, and fear aren't ranked highly in those books for a reason. Welcome to management, start reading! 

You'd be broadcasting to your potential employer that you don't want to invest $300 for the chance to meet them and possibly get a job. From their perspective, $300 is peanuts--their department spends that or more on lunch out. Investment firms pay very well. This is your chance to get their attention and shine. Personally, I would go "all in" and chase the opportunity. But that's your decision. How badly do you want this? How hard have you worked for this so far? 

Beware custom formatting on resumes, you'll be filtered out without a human ever reading it. Creativity in the formatting and structure can kill you. Most recruiters sit behind scanning software, so they'll never even see your resume if it isn't parsed correctly. Those algorithms are looking for blocks grouped by employer/position, followed by words, usually in bullet points. Deviating from that can render you invisible. There is no shame in being at one place for long. You had varied responsibilities, external visibility and career growth. You cannot list that you worked for company those Fortune 100 companies, even as a consultant. It's misleading. Should someone at company Y receive a call verifying your work, you'll look dishonest. Since you have permission, you can list that you consulted through company X for company Y on your LinkedIn account. No icons, sorry. :-( 

Why do you want to do business with any of these people? You haven't even shown up to your first day of work--or the interview!--and you already have communication problems and political issues. There's your half of the interview--they failed. If you had five options on the table, would you even be considering this circus? I'd work on getting those other options together. I'm at a loss when people start playing mental chess over legal issues, and spinning all types of what-if scenarios. There is an astounding lack of maturity on all sides, and that's all you needed to learn from the interview. 

For whatever reason, their message seems clear and firm. Trying to play a "technicality" by moving a few feet over or a few minutes later doesn't sound like it will go over well. It's a shame. Have you considered asking someone else, who looks friendly to the cause, if they will take over? The original complaint may have come from the neighbor, but if there's someone you can reasonably trust is willing, that person can take over until the whole thing blows over. My guess is that someone new to that area thinks feeding feral cats attracts them, which I don't believe is true. That's maybe the source of your complaint, but that's just a guess. 

First--all recruiters need to ask about your rate, because so many conversations with so many employers start off with either a budget, or the rate question. They look unprepared if they don't know, so it's here to stay. The recruiters have to deal with it, so we have to deal with it too. It's good to know your market value and work on improving it, rather than trying to over-leverage it. Second--we're all somewhere on the curve of tolerance to different accents. As you work with people with great diversity in this area, your brain will adapt. It is notably more difficult over mobile phones and VoIP because of the voice coding, so use a plain-old landline if possible. Having more trouble than others advertises lack of experience or hearing problem, valid or not. It's always important to follow-up with an email, tersely capturing the bullet points with the recruiter. Try to guess the proverbial checklist they have on the other side and match the answers they should have. ____, I just wanted to follow-up on our discussion: - Available with 2 weeks notice. - Expected salary is $x, but flexibility. - Experienced in ____. - Willing to commute. - Not willing to take 24/7 calls. And a final point--you have a strong accent to the recruiter. Speak slowly and clearly. Most people respond in kind. 

You are currently banking capital on this. You're getting noticed, and those thank yous are currency--bank notes you can save. The value of that capital is determined in part by the person issuing those notes--if they give out thank you's liberally, it has low value. If your COO hands them out rarely, your manager knows that currency has a higher value than others. Like any other financial transaction, keep a ledger and make a note. You really have a choice. You can save a good deal of that capital, which is devaluing over time ("what have you done for me lately" is a sign of a high inflation environment). You can try to cash in on the capital by publishing a balance sheet at the end of the year, re-iterating those achievements. It's indirect--you're basically asking for a re-issue of the capital. But the pay-off can be larger--10% raise, etc. The other option is to attempt to cash in at the time. Politely accept the capital, and trade it in for something on the spot. Take the thank-you and ask for something you can use to make your work easier--maybe a new multi-monitor setup. You can also apply it to a future purchase--like mentioning that you'd like to move up based on your success. "You're welcome ... I'm happy with how things went too. I think if we could build a small team around [new project] we could [repeat success here]." For instance, "Thanks, I think things went well. I think there's even more value hidden in refreshing this other project / doing this new project. If I could get a few more skilled hands with me, I think we'd be happy with that in 12 months too." 

For entry level development jobs, you should start applying about 2 months before. Most places will take some time to interview and finally select someone, and will anticipate that you need some few weeks to start. You will want to start looking now at available openings now to see how quickly they open and close, which skills are most in demand, and what the general qualifications are. Then you will have a better sense of the market and when you should hop in. 

This is a balance of your market worth, and your value to the company. Your level of effort and expectations are secondary. If you are substantially under your market worth, and the company is happy with you--you may be able to lean it. You'll want to raise the issue gently so you can get a "no" and stay without tarnishing yourself. For instance, it's okay to ask out of curiosity if you'll still be in an annual review, or what the normal process is, if the annual review is used to give warnings, assign bonus/raises, etc. Ask without asking if you can. If you are at your market value or your company is still unsure, asking is risky. It sounds like you are at your market value, and being patient may help to get a bigger raise when the normal process comes around. (For completeness, if you're over market value or your company isn't happy, don't push the issue--pushing a decision could cost you the job. This doesn't sound like your case.) Doing a job above what you were brought in to do is fine. Many promotions happen because people start taking over tasks above their pay grade. Consider this: imagine I told you that you have two choices. One--you can do the work above your pay grade for a year, and then there's a much better chance that you'll be promoted and recognized after that year with more money. Two--you can do the work at your level, and hope to be promoted and recognized next year based on the performance at the lower level. If you'd choose One, then you're right where you would be. 

It's reasonably normal, particularly in customer service, to ask people for a thank-you letter once they give you a compliment. In the pas, businesses would hang those on the wall to help entice new customers, which is the paper and tape equivalent of yelp. Of course, it's possible he misinterpreted your tone. It does take certain sales/people skills to make this palatable to most, and I've personally felt it's always met with a certain resentment in all but the most devoted fans. An effective pitch is to say that it would really help motivate the team, and justify the level of effort to management on your side. In effect, you're saying "If you put these words in an email, you'll continue to get great service". I think there's something else here if you squint, and might be why the caller didn't want to put anything in writing. Saying that "it will become none of his business soon" might mean he is on his way out. If so, the call may have been his way of "apologizing" for the demanding behavior of an employer he doesn't agree with. I've made exactly that phone call to a vendor once I'd decided to leave a position. I couldn't do it earlier, because it would undermine the company on my side, but I felt strongly that I should re-affirm that the treatment the vendors were receiving wasn't acceptable, and that I had done what I could do. It was also a warning that once I left, the firewall would be down, and the treatment would get worse. It's a rare company that treats its vendors like slaves, and its employees well.
