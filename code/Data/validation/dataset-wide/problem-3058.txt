It apparently happened during Caesar's campaign against Scipio and Juba in 47BC, part of the wider Roman Civil War that was fought from 49–45BC. The story was recorded by Suetonius (Life of Julius Caesar: 59). The quote, as it has come down to us from Suetonius, was: 

The claim that the Spanish crown can lay claim to be King of Hungary, even if only as a titles in pretence, appears (as with many of the claims of the current Spanish crown) to date back to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, whose full titulature apparently (according to Wikipedia) went as follows: 

That said, there are probably many theories about Tiglath-pileser III's origins, but none, so far as I am aware, that are ascribed to by reputable Assyriologists. 

From For Duty and Destiny: The Life and Civil War Diary of William Taylor Stott, Hoosier Soldier and Educator by Lloyd A. Hunter: 

For now, it is probably safer to say only that hundreds of people fought on the banks of the Tollense. The evidence certainly does not yet suggest anything that we would consider to be a standing army.

It's not much of a record of a life, but, then again, William Adelin was just 17 years old when he died. He never ascended to the throne, and lived his life in the shadow of his father. 

If you are interested in exact figures for the trade between India and China at that time, the UK government published a series of papers titled "Papers Relating to the Trade with India and China: Including Information Respecting the Consumption, Prices, &c. in Foreign Countries" in 1829 which should include the detail you're after. 

Trotsky's War Train, History Today Volume 25 Issue 8 August 1975 or, as Trotsky wrote in his autobiography: 

[Rubinstein, 2004, p34] So, if we limit the discussion to official executions during the Spanish Inquisition, experts today seem to place the total number in a range between about 3,000 and 10,000. A further 100,000 to 125,000 probably died in prison as a result of torture and maltreatment, but these went largely unrecorded in the records of the Inquisition. (The separate Inquisition in neighbouring Portugal resulted in fewer deaths) [Pérez, 2006, p173 and Rummel, 2009, p62]. Henry Kamen is one of the world's leading experts on the Spanish Inquisition. He concludes that: 

The problem here is one of definitions, and there are many, overlapping, definitions of archaeological periods in use. In the context of the United Kingdom, the medieval period ended with the dissolution of the monasteries and the Reformation, so "post-medieval" simply means "after the Reformation". However, the Reformation took place over a number of years, so where should we place the dividing line? 

The source here is the diaries of Marino Sanuto. These have been published and copies can be found on archive.org. The relevant extract from November 1531 reads: 

I'm not sure if it counts as a "war", but the Battle for Castle Itter on May 5, 1945 was certainly a battle between two service branches of the same country - the Wehrmacht and the Waffen SS. A unique feature of this battle was that the Wehrmacht were allied with a unit from the US Army. 

With the lengthening working day came an increase in Sunday working. As noted above, the change seems to have begun in about 1895, but as Fitch observed: 

One possibility for UK newspapers is the British Newspaper Archive. They have several subscriptions available and a pay-per-view option. You can also find some information in the London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes. These are sources for official UK announcements ("published by Aythority"). You can access historic copies for free. Several of the genealogy sites, such as Ancestry and FindMyPast offer newspapers as part of their subscriptions. I'm not sure how well their collection covers the rest of the world. Most of these sites offer periodic free access weekends if you're able to wait. Family Search has compiled a list of Digital Historical Newspapers. You can try checking the list for different locations around the world and different time periods. Hope that helps. 

The records of the disposal process are now held by the National Archives of Australia (NAA). A search of these records using the RecordSearch facility on the the NAA website shows that a number of Army vehicles, including trucks, were indeed sold to he general public, and that most, if not all, of those sales took place between 1945 and 1947. The records of the sales are now held by the NAA in series MP392/31 - "Lend Lease/US Army surplus vehicles for disposal". These files are held in Melbourne and contain details including: 

Given that the division of the population in the demographics you cited in the question is essentially binary, in that it contained only two categories, then - based on the answer to your first question above - the answer here is clearly yes. On the basis of known surviving evidence, the people who signed those documents were both white and male. Should any primary source document surface that suggests any of those signatories was not white (or not male!), I suspect that would be front-page news in most news media around the world, and certainly in every history journal/magazine that covers the period! 

The phrase is transliterated as "mrwty", or sometimes just "mry". It is most commonly translated as "Beloved of ..." or "The well-beloved". This is the entry from Faulkner's Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian: 

The footnotes on this (and other editions of Josephus) seem to be referring to pages in A Collection of Authentick Records Belonging to the Old and New Testament by William Whiston. In this case, another online version offers this particular footnote with the reference thus: 

In 1930 Eisenhower was appointed as special assistant to General Douglas MacArthur, who was then Chief of Staff. He wrote MacArthur's speeches, lobbied politicians and prepared a number of studies of military mobilisation, and especially of the development of air power in relation to land battles. Eisenhower accompanied MacArthur to the Philippines from 1935 to 1939, and continued to impress his commander. On his return to the United States, Eisenhower briefly commanded a battalion of the 15th Infantry and later became Chief of Staff of the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Lewis. We know Eisenhower was appointed Assistant Chief of Staff in charge of the Operations Division under General George C. Marshall who was Chief of Staff. We know that Marshall explicitly requested Eisenhower for his staff in the immediate aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Eisenhower accompanied Marshall to the Arcadia Conference in Washington from 22 December 1941 to 14 January 1942. At the Arcadia Conference,
