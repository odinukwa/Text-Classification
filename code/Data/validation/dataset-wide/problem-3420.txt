Your question is essentially about precautionary savings, i.e. the response of savings to risk. What determines precautionary savings is the coefficient of relative prudence: $CRP=-\frac{U'''}{U''}C$, where $U$ is the utility function, $C$ is consumption and primes denote derivatives. As we always have decreasing marginal utility in economics, i.e. $U''<0$, then the sign of the savings will depend on the sign of the third derivative, as you mentioned. Think of this coefficient as similar to the risk aversion coefficients. The difference is that prudence means that agents act in anticipation of risk by saving more, whereas risk aversion reflects how agents react when presently faced with risk. With quadratic utility, the coefficient of relative prudence is zero and there are no precautionary savings. Hence there is no effect of risk on savings. With such utility we therefore have certainty equivalence, which is quite convenient and hence often used. Mean preserving spreads don't matter then. So no, it is not the same as in the positive case, where savings would go up in resonse to risk. What is crucial here, as you noted, is the third derivative. The coefficient really only uses the second derivative as a normalization. A mean-preserving spread keeps the mean/expected value of consumption the same. However, it does not neccssarily keep the derivatives (marginal utility) the same, which are what matter for (savings) decisions. If the marginal utility is linear (quadratic utility), then a mean-preserving spread keeps the expected marginal utilities the same as well. Hence, there are no precautionary savings (no reaction) in that case. If the marginal utilities are convex, then the mean-preserving spread changes things in a way that matters, i.e. it becomes beneficial to save more. This follows from Jensen's inequality. If it is concave, the opposite is true. So the relevant function to look at is $U'$, as this is how the agent makes decisions. When we want to see whether a function is convex or concave we look at the second derivative. So the second derivative of $U'$ is $U'''$, which is why the third derivative matters here. 

GDP is equal to the Wages + Profits at every stage of production. Stage 1: Unnamed company sells 1M as profit in car parts to Car Motors (If the goods are imported then that 1M does not factor in, also assuming it was pure profit) Stage 2: Car Motors Turns the car parts into cars 500K is given out as wages to workers 1M is made in profit for the company. Total GDP gain: 2.5 M. If a tsunami destroys all the cars it means that the cars cannot be sold and the profit for the company is $0. Thus GDP gain is 500K in wages paid out to workers. Edit: The reason you are getting conflicting answers is due to a lack of information. GDP = Investment (I) + Government Spending (G) + Consumption (C) + Exports (EX) - Imports (IM) It is always assumed that Investment = Savings (Look up the IS relation). So if the workers were savings all of their earnings I = 500K and if they spent it all in the economy C = 500K. Either way you have 500K in GDP gain from wages. Since the cars are being exported EX = 2,000,000 for a total of 2.5M assuming the export occurs. If it doesn't then only the wages are counted. 

I assume you are referring to first generation currency crisis models, a la Krugman. Before t0: Here there is of course no benefit to attacking and causing a currency crisis (by definition). That is, before the pegged currency is overpriced (i.e. it is not overpriced) there is no profit from attacking/short selling the currency as a drop in the value of the currency is not expected and therefore short selling is not profitable. So before it is profitable to cause a crisis there can be no crisis. After t0: It would be profitable to cause a crisis and short sell a currency as long as it has not happened yet. However perfectly rational agents would react immediately, why wait? Like with investing in stocks, once you find a mispriced stock, you can profit anytime, but why wouldn't you profit immediately? Or lets say you find 100USD on the ground. You can profit from picking it up anytime after you find it, but why wait and risk that it could be too late later? Hence it happens exactly at t0 as there is no reason to wait. An investor in currency would try to be faster than others to get arbitrage profits so others would try to be even faster than him and this goes on as much as possible. Its not possible to attack before (as its not possible to pick up 100USD found on the ground before its found there) so it happens as soon as it is possible, i.e. in t0. In a second generation crisis a la Obstfeld it would take a coordination of several investors attacking at once to cause the crisis, so you don't have the effect of everyone trying to be faster than the other as they must "work together" to be successful and thus the time of the attack/crisis is not so straightforward to predict. 

This can be done quite easily using an online currency converter. Oanda is a reliable one which will have up to date prices of currency. Simply select U.S. currency in the box in the left, and the currency of the country you are in in the box on the right. Then type the price of the service you are using in the box on the left. The box on the right will now display that price in the currency of your home country. Link: $URL$ Something that you need to keep in mind is that there may be fees associated with converting the money and transferring it abroad. You'll need to work out a payment strategy with the company you are contracting to figure out how they want payment and what type of fees you will be incurring. 

I would argue that these types of goods should be considered capital because they are increasing employee productivity as a factor of production for knowledge workers. In classical economics a capital good has these 3 characteristics: 

The equilibrium between money supply (which is set by the fed) and money demand (which is set by economic factors) generates the interest rate for the economy at a given time. The fed thus has power to affect the interest rate by increase or decrease the real money supply in order to maintain an interest rate. Given that the fed has complete control over the interest rate under this model it is often assumed that LM is horizontal due to the fact that the fed can set whatever rate they choose regardless of economic factors. 

Short Answer: No. Transaction costs are defined as costs related to overcoming a market imperfection. Most people do not consider distance from a store(market) to be a market imperfection, but in some cases some do consider this. It was always my professors' opinion that transaction costs should not include transportation costs and in what follows I'll tell you why. With transaction costs we typically never mean transportation costs. Transportation is considered another good (rather a service) that we pay for. Transportation is a welfare/utility increasing good, which you would like to have. Therefore transportation has a positive price. Transaction costs refer to costs that do not go towards obtaining more welfare enhancing (desired) goods and services. In your supermarket example, the cost of searching for your desired good would be the transaction cost. Searching for it is costly, however does not provide you with any extra good/service/utility, so this cost is purely about obtaining another good and is a cost in addition to the price of the good and nothing more. 

We value stock if no dividends are paid, exactly for the reason you mention, we can sell them at a higher value later on. The value added to the stock if we invest the profits (would be dividends) into the company should be around the same value the dividends would pay off. However instead of paying taxes each time we get a dividend we can pay them just once when the stock is sold potentially saving on taxes. P.s. Blanchard is a great book and how I first started learning macro :). 

@EnergyNumbers aptly points out that Bearer bonds do exist and act in some way as a currency like you are describing. This does not answer the question of why aren't bearer bonds used instead of fiat currency? First we should understand what a bearer bond is. A bearer bond (or any bond really) entitles its holder to fixed payments over years (coupon payments) and the ability to have a pre-agreed upon amount paid at a later date (principal payment). It is essentially an agreement that a company or individual will pay the holder of the bond back the money that the bond was purchased for plus some agreed on interest. Unlike some types of bonds a bearer bond is special in that whoever holds the piece of paper owns the bond, whereas other bonds are generally in someone's name and must be transferred on paper not just physically. Theoretically it makes sense that you could go into a store and pay them in bearer bonds instead of cash assuming the store was willing to accept them. There are two big reasons for why you couldn't just stop using the fiat currency and switch over to bearer bond based exchanges. 1) Bearer bonds are not necessarily a good holder of wealth. Bonds are a promise by a company to pay back a debt over time with interest. If the company goes bankrupt as most tend to do over time the bond becomes worthless. If you had your life savings in the form of bonds and the company that backs the bonds disappears you suddenly have no money. As an employee or shop owner I may be reluctant to take payments in a currency that may have no value tomorrow. This volatility in price and the potential to lose all value overnight is why only wealthy people generally invest in securities since they can tolerate this risk. 2) Bearer bonds are worth currency. What gives bearer bonds value is that they can be exchanged for fiat currency. A bearer bond entitles me to plus interest payments. If you don't have some fiat currency what does that mean? There needs to be some agreed on value for this type of debt and some sort of unit. Even if all transactions take place in the form of transferred securities (most large corporate transactions already do) there needs to be some agreed upon unit of measurement to compare a bond from one company to the next. These same points apply to securities in the form of stocks and ownership in companies. They are simply too volatile and impossible to compare value without some underlying fiat currency. The reason the dollar works so well is that you know the US government is going to be around for a long time. You can trust that the government is going to accept payments in dollars and be paying in dollars meaning that the dollar has some intrinsic value unlike a highly volatile stock or bond. With all of this said many transactions do take place using an exchange of securities and bonds. Most corporate transactions as well as large transactions among wealthy people take place by transferring ownership of these types of investments. For small transfers (such as buying milk at the store) these types of transactions simply don't make sense for the reasons stated above. 

Yes, the FTSE 100 can decrease at the same time as the currency. It depends on what is causing the depreciation of the currency or what is affecting the FTSE at the time. It is hard to establish which way the effects are going in real time, however. Suppose the currency is depreciating due to loose monetary policy. If the Marshall-Lerner condition is fulfilled, this means companies will export more and have more profit. In that case, we could expect the FTSE to go up. On the other hand, if the condition is not fulfilled, exports may actually go down and the FTSE with it. This is the case where the currency depreciation affects the FTSE. On the other hand, the FTSE may affect the currency. If firms are facing a crisis or other problems, the FTSE goes down. This may prompt the central bank to attempt to depreciate the currency or it may prompt investments to flow out of the country, which depreciates the currency. The currency may depreciate for a while, before the monetary policy has any positive effects on the FTSE. The loss of investment will have a direct negative effect on the FTSE, as there is less capital supply and interest rates for firms may go up. Here again both the FTSE and the currency may go down. There could also be third factors that affect both the FTSE and the currency. Suppose the currency is depreciating because of other factors, e.g. an increase in uncertainty. This may cause investments to flow out of the U.K. thereby depreciating the currency. Further, that same economic uncertainty and reduction of investment could hurt profits and therefore the FTSE could go down. Moreover, a simultaneous crisis in the banking industry and a currency crisis is very possible. These are called "twin crises". See the 1999 Kaminsky and Reinhart paper in the AER for a reference. In that case, the FTSE and the currency can go down simultaneously. Twin crises are more relevant for fixed exchange rate regimes, however, so this possibility may not apply to the U.K. as much as to other countries. 

This is clearly pretty difficult to do. Luckily there is an easier method. Gini is also equal to: (The average variance for all incomes) / (2 * the mean) The average variance for all incomes can be calculated by constructing a matrix of all incomes and then calculating the distance between each income. For your example: 

There are two ways to measure inflation within an economy. The Consumer Price Index, and the GDP deflator. The Consumer price index measures the value of a basket of goods across multiple years with the base year basket of goods being valued at 100 and another year being valued at the percentage increase of the total basket of goods from the base year. So if a basket of goods cost in 2009 (The US current base year) and in 2016 the CPI for 2009 would be 100 and the CPI for 2016 would be 110. The GDP deflator is calculated by calculating (Nominal GDP / Real GDP)*100. Where nominal GDP is simply the total value of goods produced in an economy in a given year and real GDP is the value of those goods produced in an economy in a given year at the price level of a base year (also 2009 in the US). These methods give different values. CPI is a better measure for how inflation effects consumers assuming the bundle basket of goods is what is assumed the average consumer consumes and GDP deflator is a better measure of how inflation affects the overall economy and industry since it applies to all goods that are produced and not a somewhat arbitrary bundle basket of goods. Despite the differences they both are highly correlated with eachother and provide a decent measure of inflation over time as you can see by this graph: 

The reason the envelope theorem cannot be simply applied here, is becase $z(t,w)$, which consists of $l(t,w)$ and $e(t,w)$, does not only depend on $t$. It is true that these functions are optimized and first order conditions apply such that their total derivatives equal zero. However, since they are optimized with respect to two variables, we cannot necessarily set the partial derivatives with respect to t to zero. At first glance, it appears the answer should be $\frac{dW}{dt}= -(z + tz_t) + v'*(z + tz_t)$, as $l$ and $e$ are chosen optimally and the envelope theorem cancels these terms out. Furthermore, one could expect both $z_t$ terms in the final derivative to drop out due to the envelope theorem. However, one and only one $z_t$ term remains in the authors' calculations. The envelope theorem is just an application of first order conditions. In this case, it is better to simply use the first order conditions we know to derive the results, instead of using the theorem directly. I believe the authors invoke the term "envelope property" to concisely convey that they are using the previously found first order conditions. Taking the total derivative we arrive at: $\frac{dW}{dt}= wl_t -z - tz_t -c_ee' - \psi'l_t + v'*(z + tz_t)$ Inserting the expression for $z_t$ and grouping some terms we have: $\frac{dW}{dt}= l_t[w(1-t)-\psi'] + e'[t-c_e] - z + v'*(z + tz_t)$ Note that the terms in square brackets are the same as the first order conditions for $l$ and $e$ and hence equal to zero. This leaves us with: $\frac{dW}{dt}= - z + v'*(z + tz_t)$ 

If anything the is too high. There are many people in rural communities within which they earn 0 income given the fact that they are subsistence farmers and don't hold a job. The per year minimum is to state that it is impossible for anybody to subsist on 0 per day and that if someone in official statistics is recorded with an income of 0 per day then in all likelihood there is unrecorded income from subsistence farming and non-market activity. The a year salary isn't all that unreasonable considering the kind of poverty many people live in. Nearly 1.1 Billion people live in absolute poverty () which annualized is a salary of . It's quite reasonable to assume that some large percentage of those individuals make less than that which means there are millions who live on less than which the annual income would imply. 

GNP (Gross national product) measures all of incomes of every citizen in a country. This means that if I as a citizen have a business outside of my home country my income from that business still applies to the GNP. GDP, which is the more common measure is the measure of all economic activity within a country's borders. Meaning that my income from my foreign company would not be counted towards GDP. GDP is generally used as the standard for economic activity because it provides a good look into what is going on within a country's borders, without potentially inflating economic activity of a country by looking at foreign investments. 

Yes there absolutely is. It is generally agreed upon that utility is (at least) ordinal. That means I can compare utility levels for a single person (not necessarily across people) and the numbers have meaning in this sense. So for a single person: $U(down, right) = 4 > 1 = U(Up, Left)$. This means (Down,Right) is strictly better for each agent than (Up, Left). You will notice this satisfies the definition of a pareto improvement. So (Down,Right) pareto dominates (Up, Left). It is also generally agreed that a good way to compare outcomes in economics is pareto efficiency (no person can be made better off without someone being made worse off). Hence we can safely say that the equilibrium with (Down,Right) each is comparable and better than (Up, Left). This is generally accepted, not controversial and doesn't require any assumptions we dislike. Note that it is not necessary to assume here that utility is cardinal. That would mean we can compare utility levels across agents. E.g. for the statement: if U(agent 1)=4, U(agent 2)= 1, then U(agent 1)>(agent 2). Another example: saying the sum of utilities for everyone is larger under policy A than under policy B and hence A is better than B requires cardinal utility. This is a wrong assumption, but sometimes used (for example in public and welfare economics) to make comparisons. It is however controversial to use, since it is actually wrong. Public economists see it as a necessary evil. What everyone accepts is that utility is ordinal and that is all we need to compare the two equilibria.
