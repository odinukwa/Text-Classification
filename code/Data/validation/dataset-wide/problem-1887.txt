Quit badgering him If this guy is one of the best guys you have, then you need to give him some leeway and let him work the way he wants to for the main part. If there's things he's doing which are counter to your working framework, then address those. It's clear that he has a particular personality trait, so you need to work with and not against that. If you can work out what provokes his outbursts and do what you can to avoid those triggers, then things will get a whole lot better for everyone. P.S. Calling him "Rainman" even while posting anonymously as you are now (I'm assuming you create a new SE account purely for this question) is (in my opinion) really inappropriate. 

Stick with the process. I have no idea what business process you have to analyse and assign pieces of work, but there has to be something to feed into the top of your workstream, surely... In my line of work, we have a set up business requirements that gets written up when then gets translated into a solution design document, which then gets signed off by the business representatives. Anything that changes after that has to go through a change process because ignoring the analysis and solution design phases screws up everything. Your bottom line is the resource plan and the amount of time for each man-sprint (or whatever you're calling it). Throwing spanners in the works just screws up the schedule. Make it stop. Define a process and stick with it. Please, for your own sanity. 

Just refer to it by the longer name and just don't mention the shorter name. Call it "Easy Galaxy", or use this opportunity to choose another name that shows a bit more imagination and is more descriptive of what the model actually does. Better still, rename it on Git and anywhere else you have it. Since this project seems to have lived for some time with the old name, you can pass this off with: 

It sounds as though he doesn't know what's appropriate to his role and what's not, so he's attempting to get involved in everything. This could be because you're not giving him enough direction in terms of what he should be interested in. You could try starting each day with a quick run-down of the tasks for the day and indicate which items you'll be working through with him and let him know when he has "free" periods for his own learning/tasks (implying that you don't need him to shadow you at those times). On other words, give the guy some structure. 

So you attended at least one interview while you were notionally too sick to return to work... Your employer will of course point this out to you if you resign now. It therefore makes sense to resign when you're officially back at work again. You could of course return to work early, but this will also raise questions. 

Don't leave an out-of-office notice on your email. Notify the people you need to notify (and do this directly, not with an out-of-office). When you leave, emails for your account should be auto-forwarded to your manager who will then forward/reply as appropriate until those incoming emails dry up (i.e. everyone is notified that you're gone). 

Write notes during these ad-hoc meetings and start creating at least basic requirements documents. Get the document signed off by your boss before you commence the bulk of the work. This should protect both parties from the effects of forgotten/conflicting requirements. Start off with at least some bullet-points per stack and work from there. Pitch this as a "trial period" thing to soften the blow and then ramp up the detail when it's proven to be a beneficial thing to do. 

Just use what you do know. Write to the person you have the name of, there's no need to include their email addresses. There's nothing else you need to do here. 

Yes, you can ask that, but obviously it sounds a little desperate, and the interview would see this as a weak question because you're asking the interviewer to help you. You can spin this around and ask roughly the same question in a more insightful manner: 

Arrange to sit away from your boss, far enough away so that the noise doesn't bother you so much. I wouldn't escalate this issue to higher management, they probably wouldn't take it seriously without an official diagnosis from a medical professional. 

It's then up to the visiting members to find somewhere for themselves, and since that's no longer your problem, it's theirs. 

While you can certainly negotiate to get your contract changed in this way, you also need to consider how the company will interpret this request. They will probably assume this means 

It probably pays for you to learn more about the product you're supporting. Being on the receiving end of phone calls like this, you're going to face this kind of situation (where you're not fully conversant with the specific information the customer needs to know). So, any time you need to transfer a call to someone else, ask yourself whether you could have handled that call given more knowledge. Then put the research in to fill this gap in your knowledge. If someone asks for your agent ID, I'd say you should give it. Customers tend to get irritated when their questions aren't answered. Follow your standard operating procedure in this instance. Also, talk to your more experienced co-workers and ask what they do in these circumstances. 

Only follow up if the omission is important. People might not think that the correction is important enough to have you send them another email, or assume that your fingers got themselves tied up (everyone does this). You following up with corrections for minor mistakes only reinforces the idea that you don't proof-read your emails until after you've sent them. Do what the rest of us do - read your email over before you send it. If you send it to more than a couple of people, read it twice before sending. 

Probably not a good idea, for the same reasons stated in the linked question above. The company are going to wonder why you feel you need to go through the backlog/sprints. They're generally going to assume that you're going to criticise everything you feel that they're doing wrong and the interview will turn into them defending/justifying their practices rather than interviewing you. Concentrate on asking about their processes/style of working, etc. By all means ask them what challenges they face (since that's the point of you being recruited), but don't expect them to go into actual detail. 

I'd suggest something along the lines of IT Architect or Systems Architect These seem to fit the bill and "Architect" is ambiguous enough to describe both of your roles without being misleading. 

This very much depends on the size of the business and what the corporate communications are like. What I've often seen is upper management hosting "all hands meetings" where the leaders discuss the strategic position and future plans for the company. Also discussed are any challenges that the company currently has and what's being planned to mitigate them. These meetings should form the framework for your "grass roots" meetings so you can deep-dive into the issues that concern you and your team. So, if you're not having these company-wide communications, you should recommend that they happen. This will prevent upper management from having to repeat everything individually to all of the teams. 

In my experience, whenever I (or someone else I've worked with) have left a position, they normally write a polite "farewell" email to any interested parties and included a personal email address (or social media identifier) so that people are invited to stay in touch. The mailbox remains with the company. 

None is required unless the letter states that confirmation is needed as part of your company's HR leavers process. 

Use Stack Overflow as your first port of call in searching for answer. Otherwise, explore the idea of using Ad Blocking plugins for whatever browser you're using. This will minimise adverts popping up. Also, don't log into a browser at work with the same account that you use at home (otherwise you'll be "suggested" things that you search for at home). The more you search, the more you'll recognize websites that are both informative and advert-safe. 

Tell him. In discussing the answer, you can lead the conversation into a discussion on why the candidate chose that answer. It could well be completely wrong, but the decision process that went into it could lead into some insights that put the candidate into a different light. I once sat in on an interview where the interviewer asked the candidate 

Even though there isn't a right answer, the way the candidate answered was nice and displayed a lot of tact. Basically, you're having a discussion here. It's not just a question of questions/answers. 

This is a broad question because we have no idea of the circumstances involved. So the answer is "It depends". If the late response doesn't affect anything in a negative way, then just replying with "That's ok, no problem.", is fine. If there are consequences, then you can lead with "That's ok, I understand", and then go ahead with whatever the next steps are. Without knowing the circumstances, it's impossible to give you a clearer answer. 

Bugs are only classed as bugs when the users see and report them. Until that point, they're unit/QA test failures. The point here is that there's a failure in the test process here, either by you unit testing the changes, or the QA team not picking them up. Strengthen your testing process. 

Since time has now passed since that conversation, it's increasingly difficult to "solve" this one. A response would have been "Well, I must have misunderstood you - so what did you tell me?". All you can really do is move forward from here. Over time, you'll gain more experience in assessing whether what you're being told is appropriate or not. 

There's not really much you can do about this, apart from causing conflict if you do raise it. The simplest thing to do is to get a tub of moist wipes and wipe your desk every morning. I don't see this taking more than 20 seconds or so. At least then, your desk will be more consistently cleaner than everyone else's in the office. 

It's something that they might get tired of fairly soon. It sounds as though this might be a cultural as well as a sexual issue. It might be an idea to see what other people do in the same situation in the same region as a Westernized response might not work as effectively. Maybe a coping mechanism is needed. For example, wearing a looser fitting top/scarf/pashmina/whatever that makes the size more ambiguous. Other people in the same region must be addressing the same issues. 

It's unlikely that you're going to find out who did this - even if you did get a list of suspects from security, you still need to have a difficult conversation with each one. The solution is pretty straight forward. You get an email sent from the people who administer the changing rooms politely asking people to respect members belongings and that any issues should be directed to the changing room administration team (who should them pass on the concern to the person involved). It's the same thing as someone who leaves dirty plates in the departmental kitchens - the action is to inform everyone (via emails/posters) to be more respectful of others. 

Then go on to mention your free periods. The key thing here is that you're promoting yourself as a success in getting your meetings successfully concluded early, and this should send a positive message to the founder. You're also giving him a reason as to why your plans have suddenly changed. 

Logically speaking, if anyone in your team has an extreme allergy to nuts (or seafood, or anything else that's relatively common), it would be in their best interests to make this known among the people they're in regular contact with. However, if in doubt, you can open with 

This would be ambiguous enough for most people. You might want to subtly imply that a family member needed caring for, or that you were stressed in your previous job and needed some time to unwind and gather yourself. There's no much else you can say really apart from making up lies about how you used that time. Keep it simple. 

Talk to your co-workers about it. Call centres like this typically have a high staff turnover, so anyone who's been in the job a while will know the score. I guess many people will simply not turn up to work. Or, you can work on things and try to find the positive in working there. Call centres are there to help people after all. If this is one of your first jobs, try to stick it out longer. If you start quitting jobs early in your career, you might end up constantly looking for jobs that you like and never settling anywhere. 

Just walk up to his desk and ask how it's going with his code updates and offer any help. There's no need to make things any more complicated than that. He offered to do some work, so there's no harm in asking. Chances are that he's been diverted onto something else and would appreciate the help while he does "managing" stuff.... 

A company you're applying for may well take a cursory look at your social network feeds to find out what kind of a personality you have. Of course, what they look for and how deep depends on the company and the role that's being recruited for. If they see you bad-mouthing the company, then obviously they'll lean more toward other candidates. That being said, it's perfectly ok to be critical of something as long as you do it in a respectful manner, or spin that criticism in a positive way ("Wouldn't it be great if product ABC did XYZ"). A critique that smells like trolling will inevitably be treated as trolling. 

It's 40 seconds. It's not a big deal. Sure, people have annoying little habits, but it's no big deal. Grit your teeth, breathe, let it go. There, it's over. Alternatively, just raise one eyebrow slightly and give him "The Look", while he's doing it. 

It isn't your problem You have your group of 10 people in a room that's designed and furnished for 10. That's great. The issue is with the other guys who are there for their weekly meeting without a designated place to go. They're taking up your space and leaving one or more of your team-members out of a space. The solution seems obvious: 

Just nod or smile and walk on past. You don't need to greet people every time, all of the time. It's that simple. Behaviour might be led by regional customs. If in doubt, watch and copy what other people do. However, in many westernized companies, just nodding and passing is fine. Or not even nodding, or not even smiling. As long as you don't walk into each other, you're pretty much fine. 

The choice of font and formatting is largely irrelevant (just make sure that it's clear, legible, and contains correct spelling, obviously). It's the headings and content that are important here. You can change things around, but make sure that it's relevant for the role that you're applying for. As with any resume/CV, the key thing is to communicate your fitness for the role in question in terms of your skillset, qualifications, and experience. Also important is how you communicate these facts. If the CV is confusing, you won't be interviewed.... 

1) Google "Team Building Events London" 2) Print out nine decent ideas 3) Put them in a hat 4) Ask youngest team member to draw an idea out of the hat 5) Go with it 6) Have fun 

It's possible that your employers are fairly relaxed and are happy that you complete the tasks you're assigned to. But someone might start noticing that you're not giving enough seat time, and that's not really a reputation you'd want to have.... 

Call the customer services number for the company in question and talk to somebody. Be friendly and approachable and hope that you're speaking with someone helpful. If they're not helpful, call again on a different day with the hope of speaking to someone else. Describe who you are and the purpose of this request and ask what would be the best email address/phone number to use. If you simply emailed the "contact" email address, it's likely that your email is in a large pit with many other spam and random emails, never to be read. What you're trying to do here is target the person/department who can answer these questions directly. It's a good skill to develop. 

You're probably being a bit oversensitive. This could well be unconscious behaviour on his part, or a part of a coping mechanism, or it could be his way of making sure that other people don't stand too close to him. I'd do my best to ignore it and carry on as normally as possible, but give him some space. Or if it puts you off your own business, use another bathroom. Don't be tempted to make this an issue. 

No. Many people run/walk/crawl in charity events and putting this onto your resume might come across as either bragging or padding. If you regularly help to organise these events, that’s another matter. But not for occasional participation.
