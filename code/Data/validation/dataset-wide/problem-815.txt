Gravitational interactions with stars they pass could strip some Oort cloud bodies, or send then into the system as comets, or whatever Whatever caused this star to become a hypervelocity star in the first place (eg a close encounter with a supermassive black hole) might well have disrupted the Oort cloud, possibly fatally. 

Firstly do not confuse the event horizon with the singularity. Wikipedia gives the formulae for the Kerr metric. There are a number of places where this formula appears to break down because you appear to be dividing by zero, essentially whenever $\Sigma = 0$ or $\Delta = 0$, in the notation of that page, corresponding to the ergosphere and the event horizon respectively. There are two event horizons and two ergospheres but they all have the topology of spheres, one inside another (with some touching at the poles). However those are not singularities in general because you can choose other coordinates for space and time where the division by zero goes away. However you can't do this at points on the equator of the inner ergosphere, which makes those points a ring singularity. It is a ring with zero thickness (at least until quantum effects come in) .There is a helpful picture Flow of liquids doesn't really enter the picture here. One can think of the properties of this metric as a "flow" of space-time, but that's an analogy at best. There seems to be considerable doubt about what really happens inside a rotating black hole, or even, given that no information can escape from the black hole, about whether this is even a meaningful question. 

Within the framework of General Relativity there are important solutions of the Einstein equations that are (a) homogeneous but anisotropic and (b) inhomogeneous yet isotropic (about a single point). Class (a) are the Bianchi Cosmologies which are most simply described as homogeneous fluids that have different expansion rates in different directions, or some form of rotation. There don't appear to be any simple descriptions of these but at a technical level it's hard to beat George Ellis' Cargese lectures: $URL$ Class(b) solutions are the Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) solutions which have the same non-uniform density distribution in all directions about one point. See $URL$ Our present universe is on average both homogeneous and isotropic, but both types of solution (a) and (b) nonetheless play an important role in cosmology. 

The baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) have a present-day scale $\sim 100 h^{-1}$ Mpc. This has little or nothing to do with the appearance of voids, which appear predominantly on scales of $\sim 20h^{-1}$ Mpc. and below. The BAO scale is only detected in the galaxy distribution by correlation analysis and does not manifest itself by mere visual inspection, unlike the voids, filaments and clusters that dominate the appearance of the cosmic web. If anything, the voids scales are determined by the velocity field power spectrum, which is to be expected in light of the way the Zel'dovich approximation works (as explained in the movie I referred to). I would have added this as a comment to the post except that I have insufficient reputation and so this is the only way I can make the point. Apologies are offered if they are in order. 

Are you familiar with Hubble's Law? Because this is just it, in a slightly less familiar form. Note that the distance in this formula is the proper distance, the distance between us and some source, not the distance travelled. Other than that, the speed of light in a sense defines our conception of time and space, so it is mentioned in the formula. ;) 

You are quite right: Einstein's theory says the curvature of space is locally deformed. The essence of this is captured in the spacetime 'metric', a mathematical tool that tells us what space looks like and, derived from this, what is meant by 'a straight path', which photons take. If there is no source of gravitation present, the path of a photon will be what you know intuitively as a straight line. However, for some mass concentration (e.g. a black hole, as you say), this path will be bended such that the mass concentration acts as a lens. This is immediately clear from this image from the CFHTLenS survey: 

Newtonian treatments of the bending of light go back to Laplace who, in 1798, wrote about light escaping from massive bodies, ie: black holes! See Appendix A of Hawking and Ellis "Large Scale Structure of Space-Time" where there is a nice translation of Laplace's paper. Newtonian treatments cannot properly deal with all aspects of light bending. Notably, the important difference between the 'Luminosity Distance' and the 'Angular Diameter Distance' of a cosmological object is only a feature of Einstein-style theories of gravitation. It is that difference which, for example, enables us to test different cosmological models (as in the Alcock-Paczynski test). See for example the paper of Anderson etal. in arXiv:1303.4666 for technical details. (This should probably have been a comment - but I don't have the rep for that). 

The cosmic background of neutrinos is at a temperature of ~1.95K, below that of the cosmic background photons at 2.7K. There is no inconsistency here because those neutrinos were once in equilibrium with the photons just before the photons got heated by the annihilating electrons (~1 second after big bang). The loss of electrons caused the neutrinos to decouple from the photons at that point and are no longer in equilibrium. So the "temperature of space" depends on whether you cite the photon or neutrino temperature, and what you measure depends on what kind of thermometer you use. The curvature of space time can also be associated with a temperature, but that's another story. 

It is possible the gravity changed locally. Depending on what the asteroid was made of, and the details of what happened in the collision, you might end up with a lump of denser asteroidal material buried in the Earth's crust under the impact crater. That could produce a measurable (although not noticeable to a human) increase in gravity locally. 

The first thing you need to recall is that electromagnetic waves do carry momentum as well as energy. This shows up in effects like light pressure. Specifically a photon of wavelength $\lambda$ carries momentum $h/\lambda$. In and of itself, that doesn't answer your question though, since you are asking about the rotation of the pulsar, and changed to its linear momentum don't affect that. However, there are two ways this can happen. First imagine a rotating sphere which is emitting radiation from its equator. Consider a point on that equator. The radiation it is emitting "forwards" (in the direction towards which it is rotating) will be blue shifted (as seen by a stationary distant observer) while the radiation emitted "backwards" will be correspondingly red-shifted. Since the blue-shifted radiation has shorter wavelength, it has more momentum, the net effect is a force on the source which tends to slow the rotation. (interestingly, the same effect is used at much lower energy levels to trap ultra-cold atoms in what is called "optical molasses"). The second effect is a bit more technical. The radiation which is emitted towards the poles of the pulsar has a property called "circular polarization" and a beam of circularly polarized light carries away angular momentum. 

The issue is twofold: (a) whether the formation of cosmological structure is an open question and (b) if that is the case who is working on it? Structure formation always was and still is an important issue for cosmology since we need to understand that structure in order to say that we understand our Universe. As with all aspects of science, the nature of the study of structure formation has changed considerably over the past decades: today's problems are quite different from yesterday's. For one thing, we now realise that the baryonic component of the Universe is but a few percent of the total mass density. Over 97% of our Universe is made up of dark matter and dark energy. The game has changed. (a) The issue of cosmological structure formation goes back to the work of Gamow in the 1940's, but we now have very strong, I would say almost incontrovertible, evidence that the formation of the structure on large scales was driven by gravity. We understand the formation of what is referred to as the "Cosmic web", the large scale filamentary structures surrounding great voids that dominate the observed structure. This is the environment for the formation of the galaxies that we see. We have models for the process of galaxy formation. These are based around numerical gravitatinal N-Body models dressed up with semi-analytic descriptions of the star formation process. The results can look rather good: $URL$ and we can choose parameters that bring such models into some kind of accord with what is observed. The models tell us, for example, how we might study the dark matter component through observations of satellite galaxies of larger galaxies. Since we can observe the galaxy formation process out to redshifts of 2 or more (the most distant galaxy observed has a redshift in excess of 8) we can check the evolution seen in the models. If you are a cynic you might say we can "re-tune" the models. (b) We are now measuring the 6-7 parameters that describe our universe by observing various aspects of that large scale structure. We can for example look at the clustering on scale > 100Mpc and detect an excess of clustering at what is called the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) scale, a feature that emerges from the primordial Universe. We can also look at the voids in the cosmic web to do the same thing in an entirely different way. All that can be calibrated by N-Body models and compared with the answers obtained from the cosmic microwave background. So we find groups with nice names like WiggleZ looking at the BAOs: $URL$ who use redshift surveys containing millions of galaxies. It's quite amazing, even to one who works in this field. What's the importance of all this? We find that the Universe can be described by just 6 parameters. We can measure these parameters with any of these methods with an accuracy of a few percent or better. What is convincing us that we have a good model is that these quite independent ways of measuring the 6 parameters all come up with the same answer to within the experimental accuracy. This is "Precision Cosmology". We can feel confident that the Universe is made up of ~70% of dark energy because we detect its influence in different ways and all those ways provide the same values. What is it? That's the 21st century question. In short - the important questions are still open and hundreds, if not thousands, of astronomers are working on it. 

I'm in doubt whether I should put this in the astronomy or rather the coding exchange, but since my interest goes out to the former I will try my luck here. Suppose I have an image with a certain pixel scale $x$. I would like to rebin this to a larger pixel scale, $y$, but this is not an integer multiple - so I can't say, for instance, that every group of 4 pixels in the original grid will now be one big pixel in the new grid, and average their flux. Rather, I'd like something like i.e. $y=2.3\cdot x$. Is this routinely done in the astronomical community -- and if so, how? 

It's not that oxygen should not be in this state, but rather we had not discovered it (e.g. on other comets). One of the reasons for this is that interstellar O2 is very reactive and quickly reacts to form e.g. H20 and O3. Current models also favoured O2-less comets. Interestingly, the paper you're referring to also mentions the O2 abundance was rather constant over the half year of observation, which hints to the O2 actually being primordial, i.e. from when the solar system condensed. To reconcile these observations with models, a couple of possible solutions are offered: a slightly warmer primordial cloud (from which the solar system formed), or reactions with ices.
