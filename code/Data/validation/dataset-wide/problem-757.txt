You will not be able to see Saturn's rings directly with a 15x70 telescope, but you will be able to notice that Saturn appears elliptical, not round. This is due to the shape of the rings around the planet, but you will not be able to resolve the hole between the rings and the planet (much less the Cassini gap). Just as an impractical suggestion in the interest of giving to you a more complete answer, you might be able to mount a camera and use image stacking to see a smidge of ring and differentiate it from the sphere of the planet. If you do go this route, please post online about your setup and results, whether it succeeds or not. 

The guide star laser is used to adapt the optics at a specific time and location, for specific atmospheric conditions. It is not, as your question implies, used to calibrate the optics for long-term use. Therefor, if order to calibrate the satellite with a laser fired from Earth, the reconnaissance target would have to provide the laser. This is useless for non-cooperative targets, which I would imagine make up the bulk of the reconnaissance targets. I suppose that one could fire a laser from the satellite itself, but this would have the obvious disadvantage of making it even more obvious when a spy satellite was overhead. In any case, the guide star image does not penetrate the entire atmosphere, I believe that it produces an image just a few tens of kilometers up. This is useful because it is the thicker, denser and more turbulent lower air of which is the most concern to optics. Firing the laser from above would thus see the laser energy absorbed in the thinner, stiller, more predictable upper atmosphere, thus it would have must less advantage. One final reason not to use a guide star laser on a reconnaissance satellite would be power budget. These satellites are as small as possible, with as small a heat and reflectivity index as possible. The added power source, be it RTG, conventional batteries, or solar, would likely increase the reflectivity of the satellite. 

Within a few billion years our Sun would become a red giant and destroying Mercury and Venus and perhaps even the Earth. But nevertheless our solar system still have some planets like Jupiter and Neptune orbitting around the sun, because his mass wouldn't be very different. After another while our Sun would turn into a white dwarf. Probably his mass changed a bit, but would it be enough to lose for example Neptune? If not, is there a prediction at what time, if ever, our 'sun' will lose (some of) his planets for the first time? 

Of course scientists assume there would also be exoplanets in other galaxies besides our own Milkyway. Is it true that our telescopes are not good enough to see planets in other galaxies, nor by brightness changes of the stars nor by inclination changes of stars. If so could the total mass of those galaxies be an indication of the presence of exoplanets, or is dark matter a problem for that? 

In the television show " Ascension " they are supposed to be 50 years into a 100 year journey to another Star System but get this, they never left Earth . They are here on Earth in a huge biosphere . My question is if this is possible that people can be here on Earth and not know that they are not traveling through Space in a Spacecraft ? How could they not have instruments or any other way of not knowing . This plot seems a little far fetched to me, what do the rest of you have to say about it ? 

I heard on a you tube video that a new theory came out in 2015 . The theory is that there was no "Big Bang" and that the Universe has no beginning . 

I was watching a documentary and they said that Cosmologists have determined that the Universe is infinite. I find this to contradict the expansion theory. If the Universe had a starting point then how could it be infinite ? It can only reach out as far as it has expanded in the age of the Universe, 13.8 billion years . If it was infinite then it would not be expanding because it would already reach out to infinity. I hope it is clear what it is that I am trying to say ? 

The wonderful article linked by Wayfaring Stranger in the comments alludes to the reason for not sending photographs, but does not answer the question directly. As with most spacecraft outside Earth or Lunar orbit, the data rate is extraordinarily low. This page gives data rates for the current Rosetta mission, which are on the order of a dozen or two KiB/s. So a 10 MiB uncompressed image file would take 15 minutes to send. Though it would be an undoubtedly interesting photograph, it would come at the opportunity cost of magnetic readings, temperature readings, radiation readings, and other important scientific data which would help plan our next probe to survive the environment. 

The relationship is a squared relationship, therefore if you decide that you are interested in only 1000 meters as your "sky" (maybe you like to photograph birds) then you have about 3 KM^2 of sky available to you. 

I have the exact same binocular, and in fact I also have a very similar tripod and head. I'll take a photograph this evening to demonstrate my setup. I am very happy with the setup, and I find it very stable. I usually sit the tripod on grass, but I do not recall ever having a problem with it on concrete or stone. I do try to keep the neck as short as possible, and use the legs for height. Also, the binocular can have it's tripod mount moved fore or aft, I think that mine is in the full aft position. You might be able to hang a large mass (bag, perhaps) from the underside of the tripod; you should find a hook already there made specifically for this purpose. 

I think that the need to leave Earth won't be because of "limited resources" but rather that it will be too hot to stay here, when the Sun expands outward in size billions of years from now. 

Can there be any truth to the rumour that the Apollo Moon landing in 1969 was staged ? I dismissed this rumour as being nonsense but today on the news I was surprised to hear that the head of the Police in Russia is calling for an investigation concerning this . Why does this rumour that it never happened persist even today ? 

I watched a documentary where I heard some very strange theories that are difficult for me to comprehend. It is even difficult for me to explain what I heard. "Objects that fall into a black hole leave a copy of themselves outside the black hole." "We are not living in reality but in a hologram ." Does any of this make any sense to anyone ? O.K. so I went to check the title of this documentary because how can anyone explain it without knowing what I saw. "Fingerprints of God -the Dark Universe" this is the title. I do admit that I did sleep through a good part of it because it was almost 2:00 a.m. Also if anyone wants to watch it then look for it on youtube because that is where I saw it. 

The changes of the sunrise and sunset times not expire regularly in a straight line but according to a sinusoid. Around the solstice (summer solstice on June 21st and winter solstice on December 21), the day length changes the least. The difference in sunrise and sunset in the days around the solstice is only a few tens of seconds per day. At equinox (March 20 and September 23), the length of day and night on earth is everywhere the same. The difference in day length from day to day around the equinox is changing rapidly. The difference in the length of day can rise around the time of equinox to 3 minutes per day. This asymmetrical lengthening and shortening of the days is because the "middle" of the day, every day a little shifts. This has to do with the fact that the earth does not describe a exact circle orbit around the sun, but an elliptical orbit. Because the Earth's axis at an angle to the orbit around the sun takes the shorter and longer are the days asymmetrical. As for the elliptical orbit, I understand that, for example,the sun is the farthest from the earth in the summer (on northern hemispere). Because of the (second) law of areas of Kepler is the speed of the earth there the slowest. In itself, I understand then that at that time the difference in day length also is shorter. That is during June 21 (summer solstice). But so is apparently also on the winter solstice on 21 December. Precisely at that time the earth is closest to the Sun (perihelion) so the earth has a higher speed. But because of the higher rate would you expect the day lengthening/shortening would therefore be greater. However, it appears not to be so. How is that possible? So the question in short terms: sunrise in june on the 21 at 5:30 and 22 at 5:31 etc sunrise in march on the 21 at 7:30 and 22 at 7:33 So the difference is in june one minute and in march it is 3 minutes. And the question is what causes that the difference is bigger in march then in june. See $URL$ for a bigger disquisition 

Stars give off light and are visible at nighttime but Planets do not give off light . So why are Planets visible at nighttime ? 

So I got this information from a magazine , Scientific American issue Physics at the Limits. The theory is that our Universe came about, when in the "Bulk Universe", which is four dimensional, a four dimensional Star collapsed and formed a black hole which became our 3 dimensional "Brane Universe", in which we live. My question is, how could this one Star have contained all the material that is in our Universe ? 

If an Asteroid, the size of the one that killed off the dinosaurs , passed by very close to the Earth but still remained outside of Earth's atmosphere, would it cause any damage ? 

Today I heard on the radio that the Super Collider has discovered mini black holes. They said that this discovery is proof of the existence of Parallel Universes and that the "Big Bang" never happened.I don't understand this and why this discovery means that Parallel Universe exist ? Does anyone know ? 

The smallest natural object that I know of that has been detected from an Earth-bound telescope is 2011 CQ1, a one-meter asteroid observed while specifically looking for NEOs. As DeerHunter mentions in a comment, smaller artificial objects are identified and tracked, mostly by NORAD and some other national defence centers. 

A moonless night is, as you suspect, a night in which the Moon does not appear visible in the sky. This happens once per month, when the Moon is near the Sun. Due to the proximity of the Moon and the Sun in the sky, at that time the Moon is the smallest sliver possible, and therefore not a full moon. This is because it is actually the Sun that illuminates the Moon, and when the Sun and the Moon are in the same direction in the sky we are seeing the non-illuminated side of the Moon. Note the direction of the sunlight in this image: 

Since any form of contact, would be next to impossible, because of the distance involved, I think the only importance of such a discovery would be for our curiosity . 

Recently a Galaxy was discovered that contained no Dark Matter. I was wondering what explanation could be offered for this ? This Galaxy also contains only 1% as many Stars as our Milky Way does . Is there be a connection between these two things, lack of many Stars and lack of Dark Matter ? 

Does the Earth receive any heat at all from the millions of other Stars in our Galaxy ? Is it light that is bringing the heat and perhaps it cools down on the long journey in Space getting to the Earth and that's why no significant amount of heat is getting here ? 

Is Earth the perfect place for life ? If it isn't then how could conditions be better here ? For example, the size of the Planet, our atmosphere, distanace from our Sun etc. 

I notice that Wikipedia give two contradictory terms for the time period in which a planet rotates in relation to an infinitely-distant object. In one place this is called a "sidereal day" and in another "stellar day". Which of these are correct? For that point, is this an IAU definition? I cannot find the definitions on the IAU website. From the Sidereal Day page: 

I'm not far from you (Israel) and I am also waiting to see comet ISON. Comets are very unpredictable, and comet ISON has not yet reached the critical part of its journey which will determine visibility for us. Comet visibility is usually due to reflection of the Sun's rays on the coma and tails of the comet, as the nucleus is to small to see directly. So ISON's visibility (and all comets for that matter) depend on how much gas, water, and other materials that it outgasses. This in turn depends on how much volatiles it has, how much the Sun melts them, how much the slingshot around the sun and tidal forces fracture the nucleus, and other factors. So the actual visibility that will occur is very difficult to determine in advance. That said, ISON has all the markings of this being its first trip around the Sun. Thus, we assume that it has many volatiles to release and we assume that ISON will be exceptionally bright. In any case, ISON will be most visible when it is closest to Earth, near the end of December. It should be most visible in the early morning sky, I'm guessing at about 4:00 AM or so. This is because ISON will be close to the Sun (thus visible close to the time that the Sun becomes visible). Like all celestial bodies, it will rise in the East. Each day the comet will move farther from the Sun and thus will be visible earlier and earlier in the night, until it disappears from view probably sometime in mid January. You are welcome to visit Beersheba and have a peak through my binoculars! 

In all these years of listening, why hasn't SETI detected anything ? Is there no intelligent life out there or is it too far away to detect ? 

If Space is expanding between the Galaxies then why isn't it also expanding between the Stars within the Galaxies as well ? In fact why isn't Space expanding within our Solar System ? 

I don't see why this question would be down voted. I think that the most we could determine is that the conditions for life are present on a Planet. The only way to know for certain would be to actually go there . However we could perhaps detect certain gases that could only be emitted from living organisms and this would be be some proof. 

So I read that if an astronaut travels at the speed of light and goes to a nearby star system , when he or she returns, he or she will have aged 10 years but 1000 years will have gone by on Earth. Travel at the speed of light is not achievable ,so I was wondering if the spacecraft was traveling at an achievable speed of 10% the speed of light , how much will the astronaut have aged and how much time has elapsed here on Earth upon the return of the astronaut ?
