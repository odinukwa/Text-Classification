to make a long question short, I'm currently doing Wendler's 5/3/1 with the Triumvirate assistance. I'm following the exercises he has in his book as part of the triumvirate because I am interested in getting stronger in some areas(like chin ups, good mornings, etc). The program is recommended for 4 times a week so I'm doing the 4 main lifts on Mon/Tues/Thurs/Fri and 30 minutes of just HIIT cardio on a stationary bike on the Wednesday I'm off. However right now since the first week of 5/3/1 is relatively light, I've been able to power through the main lifts, my two accessory exercises, and still get 20 minutes of HIIT cardio in after lifting all in about an hour. I wonder if this will simply be too much later on and if I should replace the accessory exercises with the cardio completely? Thanks. 

After doing much extensive reading and self learning I've always been under the assumption that the only things that can genuinely give you "energy" are macro nutrients since the body can utilize them for energy through the process of gluconeogenesis. And I know that creatine provides a little bit of extra oomph by sparing ATP when you're used up all your stores for the moment. But what exactly do more pre workouts do that provide energy? A lot of the time people associate words like "buzz" and "jittery" with them, increased body temperature, among other things. But most of the time there really aren't any direct compounds in them that are responsible for giving you USABLE energy. If I had to guess I'd say the primary actor in most pre workout energy powders are psychoactive stimulants(such as caffeine and taurine) with dosages multiplied to exponential amounts combined with current trending blends of "bodybuilding cocktails" e.g. BCAA's, in essence giving consumers a greatly increased feeling of anxiety. Anxiety in the sense of "I feel like I ought to do something" but greatly amplified. So what do you guys think? 

I'm in the middle of dealing with my lordosis (also known as "anterior pelvic tilt" - you can find some good references if you search on that). For exercises, dead bug variations and hip raises have been good. You need to be very good to make sure your back is flat during all of them. Oh, and the standing exercise where you have a band at your feet and step back and forth - that is a great glute exercise. But for me, the big winners have been the deadlift and suitcase carry. You need to be very careful to start with light weight and to be very careful with your form, especially on deadlift. I have also found that it's hard to tell the difference between exercises that aggravate my back and those that are just making the muscles tired. You will probably have to play around with things a bit. 

You could try goblet squats, where you hold a single weight in front of you. Or you could just to bodyweight squats, and work on getting low (ideally, you want to have your upper legs parallel to the ground or slightly lower. ) 

I'm 23 and god only knows how this could've happened. It could either be from the other day when I got trigger happy and evacuated my bowels quickly(I wasn't bearing down hard I just push it all out relatively quickly and with ease)or from squatting and deadlifting. I've been doing stronglifts 5x5 for a few months and had some trouble making gains until I really started to push myself. I'm afraid that the extra exertion I've been putting into my lifts has played a role in the formation of this. But should I continue to lift tomorrow? I want to say that I put a lot of pressure in my ass as I exert the force on the squat, because everyone always says to squeeze your glutes. Could that have been the cause? My lifting stats really aren't even that high: OHP: 100 Squat: 225 DL: 225 BP: 180 Rows: 100 

This is a similar issue concerning the whole simple vs complex carb myth. Typically foods that have a high glycemic index have a relatively low to zero fat content which causes your body to digest high GI foods faster. 

You are doing intervals to put an intense load on your system. It's important to keep that load relatively constant to get the best benefit from them. You can also use this to tell if you need to stop early; when an interval gets lots slower than the previous one, you are done for the set (and perhaps for the day if you're doing multiple sets). I don't do running intervals, but when I do intervals on my bike, I see a 5% variance in power often. I wouldn't worry too much about small variances. 

BMI does not work well for people with significant muscle mass. Go out and get your body fat measured (DEXA or hydrostatic weighing are the best methods). That will give you another bit of data. 

What are you eating after you long/hard workouts? It's really important to replace the glycogen that you burned; if you do not, your body will tear down your muscle to help build back your glycogen stores. The earlier after the long/hard workouts, the better. Chocolate milk is a good choice if you tolerate dairy products well. I like a recovery drink called "Endurox". Or you can eat small snack/meal that is mostly carbs but with some protein as well. Give that a try and see if it helps... 

I don't really think that my core is being worked enough when performing the compound lifts of strong lifts, as the rest of my body has caught up while my stomach and waist are still really flabby and have no real firmness comparatively. I'm not asking "what exercise do I do to reduce stomach fat", I'm asking if I can add in some cable crunches and another auxiliary exercise to strengthen and firm my core for other lifts and if so what would you suggest? As I understand exercises like sit ups and laying crunches and other variations(leg raises) are limited mostly by the inability to use weight above your body weight effectively so weighted exercises for abs/core are recommended. Thanks! 

Now I'm lifting relatively heavy weight in the squat, sometimes on the way up my knees cave in. I've already googled the common causes and found that this can be due to weak hip muscles causing others to compensate thus bringing your knees in. But what would be more beneficial for stretching out and strengthening these muscles, adding an assistance exercise or dropping the weight and focusing on really opening my hips up? 

There is a concept known as "training stress". When you put stress on your system and then give your body time to recover, you will improve. When you started, it was easy for you to put stress on your system, but over time, your body adapted, and now you only put enough stress on your system to stay where you are. The solution is to change up what you are doing, to once again provide training stress. To do this, you will need to increase the intensity of the work that you are doing. You can't do this with your current workout, so you will need to change your workout to be harder (during the high-intensity parts) and then easier during the rest of the workout. I'd also start by reducing the number of workouts back to twice a week. You can find lots of good running interval workouts online. I would also suggest that you consider fartlek workouts; they will likely to be more interesting. Do the interval workouts for a couple of weeks, do one easy workout to make sure you're well-rested, and then retest the runs you are doing now. You will see an improvement.
