I think anyone who believes they have been in samadhi since birth is probably crazy. I would ignore them. 

It knows, it cognises (MN 43); it arises dependent upon sense organs, sense objects (MN 38) & the mind-&-body (SN 22.82) ; that is all that can be said about it. 

Just like when the breathing is calmed, by remaining non-attached & equanimous towards rapture & happiness, they will calm. 

Teaching on gratitude & “duty” is not necessary for Nibbana. MN 117 states gratitude & duty is a defiled (asava) right view with attachment (upadhi) siding with merit. In MN 56, Upali's stream-entry resulted in independence from the teacher. In the Vakkali Sutta, Vakkali was rebuked for wrong gratitude. Dhammapada 294 states to "kill the mother & father to attain Nibbana". In MN 86, the arahant Angulimala, ate his alms food without debt (obligation). Gratitude is a moral teaching for worldlings (puthujjana) but is unrelated to the goal of Buddhism, namely, Nibbana. Dhp 43 says: 

The causes of suffering, as explained in the 2nd Noble Truth & Dependent Origination, are ignorance, craving, becoming, attachment & self-identifying (self-view). A Buddha or fully enlightened person has eradicated all suffering. A Buddha experiences no suffering in life whatsoever. Below are pictures of suffering. 

No. Buddhism is for people who wish to find freedom from suffering & perfect peace. The Buddha is called the 'teacher of gods & humans'. The scriptures report most of the Buddha's leading disciples were formerly Brahmans. If the history of religion is studied, both Indian & Western, it will be found great changes to religion occurred after the Buddha. For example, the Jewish Bible is divided into pre-exile & post-exile writings, in which many of the post-exile writings sound very similar to Buddhist ideas. The novel teachings of Jesus are closer to Buddhism than to pre-exile Judaism. For example, in the Tevijja Sutta, it is taught the way or path to Brahma (God) is to radiate perfect unconditional love in all directions (which is similar to what the Christians later taught). In summary, SN 12.23 states the supporting condition for faith in Buddhism is the clear experience of suffering (and thus wanting to end suffering). The Buddha is the Spiritual Doctor; the Healer of Suffering. 

The Pali is 'sattā opapātikā'. 'Sattā' means 'beings' (plural). The singular is 'satto' ('a being'). SN 23.2 defines what 'a being' ('satto') is, which is, importantly, a state of suffering: 

The 5 aggregates are the components of life. The 5 aggregates are essentially the same as the 4 foundations of mindfulness. Therefore, when you meditate, you are observing the 5 aggregates, which is essentially the same as observing the 4 foundations of mindfulness. The important aspect of the 5 aggregates in meditation is to see the five aggregates are only the aggregates (rather than 'self'). The 4 foundations of mindfulness are about seeing the body as 'body', the feelings as 'feelings', mind as 'mind, mental states as 'mental states' and reality as 'reality' (rather than seeing these things as 'self'). 

Yes. To clearly see a thought arising is a very advanced practise because it can really only occur clearly when the mind is strongly established in an empty concentrated mind. 

We cannot hurt people with the Dharma teachings. When people are hurt in Dharma discussion or debate, it is because they are using the teachings in the wrong way, i.e., for egoism (as explained in the Alagaddupama Sutta). 

There are two methods to reduce thoughts: (1) Wisdom method, which is replacing unwise thoughts with wise thoughts. This will reduce the thoughts & build the wisdom that stops the re-arising of such thoughts in the future. Examples of wise thoughts are exactly what you have posted, which is thinking to yourself: "These fantasies are delusional & are a waste of time". (2) Concentration method, which is to use the breath to feel calmness. When the mind feels calmness, it will not be inclined to think unnecessary thoughts. Before the Buddha attained enlightenment, he generally used the wisdom method to reduce his unbeneficial thoughts (refer to MN 19). This is called 'yoniso manasikara' or 'wise reflection'. The mind is difficult to know clearly & manage therefore this is a task we each much learn. The Dhammapada states: 

This cannot be true because the Dhamma taught by the Buddha is not blind faith in ridiculous ideas such as a person (atta) has transmigrated over billions of personal lifetimes and has cried more tears (over their family members) than the four great oceans. Given there is a water cycle on the planet earth, it would be impossible that millions of selves (atta) could cry tears over millions of lifetimes greater than the four great oceans, otherwise the planet Earth would have flooded. 

Yes, this is also a common idea and possibly a beneficial idea, namely, to discourage people from committing suicide. However, there are no references in the Pali suttas I have read where the Buddha was pre-occupied with this concern. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The following discussion supports Buddhadasa's viewpoint: DN 15 is the only discourse from thousands attributed to the Buddha, I am aware of, which makes an unclear inference that consciousness is 'reborn' (i.e., enters into a mother's belly). Why DN 15 is unclear & considered by many scholars, including scholars that believe in reincarnation/rebirth, to be unauthentic is because it contradicts the many other reported discourses on the same subject. In the many other discourses, such as MN 43, SN 22.79, MN 9, MN 148, MN 18, SN 12.2, SN 12.67, SN 22.56, SN 22.82, MN 38, SN 22.53, etc, it is written that: 

While living in the palace, Prince Gotama realised he would die (read Sukhamala Sutta), which resulted in him losing intoxication with the ordinary life of pursuing transient pleasures, which he also saw caused anguish & addiction in people and brought little happiness & much disappointment (read Magandiya Sutta). In other words, Gotama did not directly or actively inquire into death to gain enlightenment because death was an established fact to him. The 'morbidity' referred to is 'suffering' & Gautama's inquiry was always into suffering. Therefore, when inquiring into suffering, Gotama inquired into Dependent Origination (read Maha Sakyamuni Gotamo Sutta). Gotama asked: "Why do beings suffer?" and answered: "Beings suffer due to aging & death", i.e, "loss'. Then Gotama asked: "Why do beings suffer due to aging & death?". His answer was "birth". Why does birth occur? Due to becoming & attachment, etc. As for his countless "past lives" and also the word "reborn" (in SN 12.10, above), these are just mistranslations of the respective Pali words "pubbe nivāsa" and "uppajjati". For example, this translation of SN 22.79 correctly does not use the words "past lives". Instead, it uses "past abodes". Everything above points to something called "birth" ("jati") as being the main problem the Buddha identified. After his enlightenment, the Buddha's 1st words were:
