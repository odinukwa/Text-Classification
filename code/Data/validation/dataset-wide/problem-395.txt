Yes it is possible, it has already been done, Mormons built the Granite Mountain Records Vault; as is the Canadian Iron Moutain Vault Limestone, it result in elaborate tunnels and caverns. see here and here for examples Considering that the tunnels are already big enough for humans and large machines to traverse, this shouldn't be a problem. Building shelters from scratch isn't cheaper or easier, but more available. SO, the reason it is so rare is the same reason going to a police station during the apocalypse is stupid, everyone wants to do it; People who want to build them pay a lot of money to be able to. 

Best Case senario He can go 7-8 kilometres a second, around 420-480 kilometres a minute So his hourly speed will be 25200-28800 kilometres an hour! The Reality The statistics above assume that the earth is flat which it is not. There are many details that will affect his speed depending on his route. 

It commonly seen it apocalyptic fiction that if the government can't save a section of the populous they simply kill them an example would be the beginning of Last of Us. Assuming that the zombie apocalypse happened, why would a government kill civilians instead of ignoring them or letting them die? 

The Maya civilization was the most advanced civilization in the Americas before the conquest by the Spanish. They had incredible advancements in astrology, writing and technology and were the only civilization in the new world to domesticate an animal, the llama. But none the less, like every new world culture, they were destroyed. But does it have to be this way? Is it possible for me to keep the Maya civilization running to this day? If so, what is the smallest change I can make to history to allow them to live? 

The featural writing system (first used in hangul) is a writing system in which the glyphs themselves contain phonetic information in the characters. It is widely agreed by linguists and conlangers that featural writing systems are the epitome of writing, but unfortunatly the first was created in 1500 AD, as opposed to the ancient quality of logographs. No one can deny the appeal of having an old age culture having this system, but could they? When is the earliest I can hope for a culture to create a featural writing system? 

The worlds largest bat, the Golden-Crowned Flying Fox, weighs in at a wingspan of 1.5-1.7 meters and a weight of only 1.5-2.6 lbs. But with these estimates, we can absolutely do better. Introduce Argentavis, the largest bird ever to exist weighing in at an impressive 154-159 lbs with an estimated wingspan of 23 feet! Doing fancy math and applying the square cube law we get a bat size of 8.85-14.21 lbs for a bat with an equal height to Argentavis. But you know what they say, go big or go home. Behold the king of evolutions air,Quetzalcoatlus, weighing up to an estimated 550 lbs with a theoretical wingspan of 10 meters (32 feet 10 inches), this was the largest animal to ever fly. Again scaling up the Golden-crowned Flying Fox using the square cube law we get a bat of equal size should weigh in at around 39.6 pounds, now while this seems odd, keep in mind 2 things. 

Assuming a technological progression roughly similar to that of Europe in our world, what is the earliest that a civilization could have developed rigid-frame Guns? As far as I know the Chinese even had fireworks in 200 BC. Some even argue that the Romans could have invented guns as well. Given the technologies and and resources involved with creating and maintaining firearms, how early could a civilization realistically have developed them? 

In a world I am building, the day lasts longer than the year, 9 times longer in fact. The native people of this world have been forced to migrate around the world, both avoiding the scorching desert of noon and the freezing winter of night. This world is otherwise rather unremarkable on the surface. Outside of the planet is a ring as well as many small moons, so many that the tides are rather small and unpredictable, but as I was designing their culture I realized something, without seeing the stars, would the have astronomy? How would a species that lives in eternal day have any knowledge of the stars? 

Well first, on the macro scale, we have cars. Without friction, cars will not be able to gain or lose momentum, this means two things; one, all emergency vehicles cannot help people and two all currently moving cars will not be able to stop. An benefit is the remaining existence of pressurized movement, which will allow most technology and (most importantly) the biological technology to go unaffected, so your heart will still pump blood. Do not think this means that you will be fine, sound will move much faster as their is much less friction to slow it down; it may go fast enough to make every sound worthy of a sonic boom, every living thing on earth will likely go deaf. Basically what we have is the removal of the main method of decreasing momentum, all that can stop an object is gravity and interference. This means all planes will be left to die as will all people in elevators. Luckily opposite force (a la newtons law) is not effected, so walking is unaffected. With this we have our answer; anyone, anywhere in a moving object will likely die, I would estimate that this at least half the population (though I suspect much more) Will this cripple humanity? yes. Will they be unable to restore the world as they once knew it? Absolutely. Will everyone die? no, there will be hundreds of millions of survivors, all scared, in pain and confused. 

To people who have not played the game, these geysers produce spice which acts as currency. What I'm wondering is, could these Spice Geysers exist in a realistic way? 

We start with a flying fish like creature (hereafter called gliding fish for clarity's sake) and introduce the carnivorous gliding fish whose main diet consists of regular gliding fish. Gliding fish who are able to glide for much long periods escape the carnivorous gliding fish better than their counterparts and thus gliding time lengthens. Suddenly carnivorous gliding fish evolve the same trick which in turn also make regular gliding fish glide time increase. The limit is now breathing. Since having a fish like creature evolve lungs suddenly is a bit hard to explain. Let's say that, like amphibians, they keep a thin layer of mucus around them so they can survive longer over water. Again, by having the carnivorous gliding fish copy this, it will become more efficient. All that's left is going from gliding to flying. We'll do this the way we do with dragons, the fins stretch out and slowly gain joints to increase glide time even more and over enough generations, you'll gain flight. 

The only true way to build an inescapable maze is for the maze to always change its layout, like the temple in Alien vs Predator or the maze from Maze Runner. This ensures that no matter how many times you use it, your memory is false and no matter how lost you get, you cannot go back. This culture has unlimited resources and 400 years to build an always changing labyrinth but, I can only use technology from the years 2500 BC - 2100 BC. This labyrinth can and will be discovered 4000 years in the future and must still be able to move its internal components that allow it to change. For the sake of simplicity lets say, using hand waving, that the explorers cannot drill or explode through the maze, they must go through it. Using the above information, how would People from this time build this? A list of Can We Build question can be found here 

Disease, similar to rats in the black plague, perhaps these disease immune dogs breed a super-bug by accident this disease would not kill them but would kill people who get near them and catch it. Marked as a major biohazard, Detroit may be evacuated (after all it isn't the most thriving city). The people don't care. Detroit is a dying city, let's face it. 

There are currently over 7 Billion humans inhabiting the Earth and that value is increasing exponentially, its estimated that by the end of the century the human population will reach numbers of over 10 billion but scientists are unsure if even this is sustainable. Lets start with food; If you were to take all the land area being used for modern livestock and put it in one place, it would take up all of Africa (7.5 billion Acres), in fact even Africa would not be large enough as it would require 8-9 billion acres. Doing the same for crop production would take up an area the size of South America (4.4 billion Acres) but after a while the soil in these areas will degrade until fertility decreases and it erodes, rendering it useless for growing crops and not only that but scientists are unsure if farmers can even maintain their current cop yields due to changes in the environment. See, the global average of carbon dioxide emissions per person is about 5 metric tons per year but for Americans that averages closer to 17 metric tons per year. Remember this is per person so if we have about 3 billion more people living on this planet and they all adopt a life style similar to an American, the effects of global warming will be worsened even more, in fact it's projected that the temperature of the Earth will increase by 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century and with that increase comes more extreme weather conditions which would inevitably disrupt food production even more. This can be partially remedied by forcing a everyone on Earth into a purely vegetarian diet and reclaiming the land to grow more crops instead of raising livestock but the crops won't be enough to feed an infinite number of people in fact some scientists predicted 10 billion people and more than likely most people will not voluntarily switch to a vegetation diet. After all, bacon is a beautiful thing. But what about the available water? Humans are currently using up to 30% of Earth's accessible water supply with the rest being used for agriculture and the water available to some people in countries life Ethiopia, Cambodia and Haiti isn't even clean enough to drink. So the amount reaching humans would have to increase with the increasing population so to answer the original question, Earth may be able to hold up to 10 billion people living decent lives and may be able to hold more, but the quality of those people's lives (past the 10 billion mark) would be much lower than they are right now. 

Natural challenges In a world without imagination, art would consist less of pretty, not real things and more of challenging things, for example; 

No, unlikely, not at all, inconceivable. Plagues are a result of animal illness transferring to humans, all that intercity travel did was spread plague in between cities. If trading was cut off, it would not prevent plague and while it may slow it down, the cons of trading being limited would far out way the pros. 

Aliens have discovered a new planet in its Goldilocks zone that (other than gravity) is the same in every way to Earth. They wish to bring Earth animals into the planet to create their own ecosystem test, but there exists a problem, this new planet (named Terra) has a gravity 72% that of Earth. The life that currently exists on Terra is comparable to very basic plants and animals but it is very early life. They have enlisted their greatest minds to figure out what animals to choose. What Earthen animals would be to quickest able to adapt to this new low gravity world? 

No, not just a regular no, but really not yes no Biology loves equality in it's proportions. Both in symmetry and distance from bone, this is why there are no lumps of skin in the natural human body. Even if for stone reason a species evolved such a form, breaking bones and cutting oneself would become extremely common place. Any animal that evolved this shape would be a result of.... intelligent design. So, in other words, no the answer is no, in every way there is no way. 

The Mokèlé-Pangolin I then went down into the line of mammals, specifically native african giants. This is when I discovered the perfect candidate; the giant Pangolin. 

Let's say that a race of aquatic merfolk have managed to achieve sapience, they are basic hunter gatherers, living in relatively shallow waters of up to 100 meters deep. As I have begun designing their culture I have ran into a road block, how does such a species develop agriculture? After all, very few plants exist so deep and those that do grow do not produce fruit or vegetables. I had originally planned on them domesticating schools of tuna or salmon or even prawns or krill, but the amount of such an animal they would need to keep in order to provide for even just a town would be way too massive. How does a culture living underwater develop agriculture? If they cannot develop agriculture, what else can exist for them in lue of it? Let's assume that these merfolk are omnivorous mammals. 

The "bite" of an assassin bug is a four step method. First, the bug impales the exoskeleton of its prey with its proboscis. They will then inject a venom that paralyzes the victim instantly before pumping it full of digestive fluids. Finally, the bug sucks up its meal. This is obviously terrifying, it's the equivalent of a war pick on the face of an insect. Rather, it would be terrifying if it were even a slight threat. The problem here is their size. If they were larger, they would be a major threat, but alas, the square root law destroys this dream. But, what if we just take the feature we want? Is it possible for a vertebrate to have a mouth in the style of the assassin bug? If so, how big can it become? If not, how close can we get? 

The land that the could have and did support them, but they were economically weak. What is the smallest thing I can change in history to allow for Newfoundland to exist well into the 21st century? 

The more I think of it, I don't think mutants would want to be identified as mutants but not all of them will be super heroes or super villains. In a modern western culture, what would the politically correct term for Mutant be? 

A common sight in fantasy is the mountain fortress, a Dwarven castle embedded in a giant pile of rock. In Lord of the Rings, in the Lonely Mountain, lies the city of Erebor, the city in the Mountain, but how realistic is it? Assuming that I have an army of 5000 workers willing to build this castle, how long will it take? What problems would arise and what would the advantages and disadvantages be of building it? A list of Can We Build question can be found here 

In a story I am working on the entire earth has fallen into winter that; exists in the same level and temperature all over earth and never ends. The top scientists around the world have been trying to find out why it is happening and how to stop it. Here are the rules of the great winter;
