I also would disagree with Kuhn on whether many of his supposed examples of "paradigm shifts" would actually qualify as such. However, I think there are better and clear examples of paradigm shifts in the history of science, which if nothing else serve as proof of concept. In fact, I was reminded of what is probably the best example by the questioner's accidental word choice here: 

In one sense, the answer to your question is "no, complex numbers are the end of the line", and that is in the sense of being an algebraically, closed field. The next step in the sequence of algebraic field extensions is to ask, "Do all complex algebraic equations have at least one complex root?" Turns out they do (this is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, if that rings a bell from your high school days). So it appears we finally both have all the numbers we need (at least for these purposes) and have exhausted this method as resource for constructing new numbers. Time to get more creative if we'd like more toys to play with. One well known route is the Cayley-Dickson construction which generates a sequence of algebras over the real numbers. Each step produces and real algebra with twice the dimension of the previous step. While the previous kind of extensions centered on the idea of broadening the variety of operations we may perform on numbers (subtraction, division, infinite summations, algebraic roots), the Cayley-Dickson extensions revolve around generalizing the variety of structures numbers may represent (from the number line, to the complex plane, and then higher dimensional spaces after that). After the real and complex numbers, there are quaternions, octonions, and sedenions. Now our chain of number sets and their subsets is up to: 

If we grant that there is a proposition wherein something meaningful is being asserted, does that require us to think of language as essentially representative in some way? If language didn't contain the proposition, then language could be thought of only as a 'game' to be played, wherein our words do not represent anything beyond themselves and are rather pieces and tokens to be used in the game of our behavior. But if there is granted the semantic value of the proposition, does that necessitate that at least this aspect of language must be considered representative? And if so, is it really possible that language not be representative in this regard? Isn't the proposition, or semantic affirmation/negation, an inescapable fact of our semantic behavior? 

Wittgenstein is critical of the 'private linguist' and his exclusive use of the ostensive definition, where the definition provided for a given word is an example or a 'pointing out' of what the word might refer to. But it would seem that the origin of our language is rooted in ostensive definition. It is after all how children with no prior knowledge of a public language begin to learn a language. Their mother or father points to something while stressing a given word. Wittgenstein doesn't seem to have been one to hold that the entire language game is a farce. As such, what allowed him to criticize ostensive definitions in the private language argument while not coming to criticize language acquisition through ostensive definition in the case of children? 

This is the classical argument from design. Though the concept of intelligent design is a fairly ancient religious inclination, Aquinas's Fifth Way appears to be the first attempt at a philosophically rigorous formulation. 

In your question you proposed a modified conditional (which we'll call ⇒ to distinguish it from the regular material conditional) where vacuously truths are replaced with vacuous falsehoods. The modified truth table that goes with this new operator is: 

One might wonder whether this mathematical paradigm shift also counts as a scientific one, and the answer is yes. The distinction between physical geometry and mathematical geometry wasn't really understood until centuries later. For the ancients, geometry could be considered the science of space. The unification of method geometry offered across diverse fields such as statics, astronomy, navigation, surveying, and geodesy (a science invented by the Greeks) only served to cement the transition from number to space. 

Quine's naturalistic holism is marked by the idea that our methodology should be concerned with empirical data as understood by modern science in conjunction with the idea that every theory is underdetermined by the data it espouses to interpret. This seems to lead to the conclusion that our theories are never certain, and are always open to revision. But suppose the traditional epistemologist thinks that what Quine means in the first half of this supposition, regarding his empiricism, is in need of clarification. The epistemologist would want to ask Quine just what qualifies as 'science' or more plainly 'empirical'. Or perhaps in questioning Quine's holism the traditional epistemologist wants to know why Quine thinks to begin with that a theory being undertetermined by empirical data is suggestive of what Quine thinks it's suggestive of. Furthermore, one might question the globalism of Quine's holism, and how he moves from points of an empirical nature to knowledge simpliciter. These questions might very well arise in the spirit of Quine's holism itself, wherein their answers are uncertain and dictated by whatever conditions characterize their place in the 'web of belief', in which case Quine could respond to them with relative ease. But where they are truly interesting is where they arise outside of the context of Quine's holism, in question of Quine's holism. The traditional epistemologist holds that unless these questions have specific answers there is no justification of Quine's holism, no reason for them to accept Quine's holism (and no reason for Quine to accept his own holism). Indeed, when these questions are asked in the context of accepting Quine's holism as true, an inevitable circularity ensues, as Quine himself admits of his naturalism elsewhere. For Quine's relativistic holism requires that there be no set 'criterion' for determining what is and isn't 'science', nor even a set criterion for what is and isn't 'holism'. To accept Quine's holism is expected by Quine to be a provision that stems from his holism itself. But be it that accepting his holism is what is in question, it seems that Quine is begging the question against those who are seeking a standard or justification of his methodology. 

The thing about 'why' questions is that they presume an answer exists, whether or not an answer actually exists. Suppose I answered your question with "You should behave morally because such-and-such reason." That reason would then be an incentive to act morally. But we're operating under the premise that no such incentives exist. Contradiction. I also object that the very idea of actions without consequences might not even be coherent. An action is something done so as to accomplish a purpose. They are by definition characterized by the intentionality of agents. If there are no consequences, then by the same token there are no actions either. 

In classical Boolean logic at least, logical connectives can be completely understood semantically through their actions as truth-functions of Boolean values. In other words, the truth table associated with a particular logical operator provides a complete description of that operator. The standard truth table for the material conditional → is: 

Quine saw that any group of theories could have the same pieces of data. There is a gap between any set of data and the interpretation we have of it. Quine then felt that in light of this, whether this or that theory/belief were true and correct is relative, since any theory in consideration could contain the same data. But does this conclusion only follow if it is held that the data of theories is the sole form of justification of any theory? 

Quine's holism is marked by a scientific methodology. Perhaps not all beliefs in Quine's web of belief are accurate, but at its best the web consists of the refined, matured string of beliefs which are collectively of a scientific nature. However, a natural question arises: just what qualifies as 'scientific' for Quine? And another question: how is the traditional epistemologist's understanding of knowledge related to Quine's understanding? A simpler summary of these questions is as follows: what does Quine accept and reject of the traditional conception of 'knowledge' and 'science', and how are the two related in Quine's approach? And although it might be asking a bit much, what is the role of pragmatism in all this for Quine? 

At this point you probably notice something peculiar, namely that this truth table is awfully familiar. It turns out your modified conditional would just be completely equivalent to standard logical conjunction. Another oddity to note about this modified "condition": just like conjunction, it's symmetric with respect to p and q! That means, it doesn't matter which one of p and q you call the antecedent and which one you call the consequent. It's this property which it makes virtually useless as an operator whose intended purpose is to capture our intuitive notion of a conclusion predicated on a conclusion. As example to illustrate how important order is in changing the meaning of a statement, consider the Zeroth Law of Biology. The Zeroth Law states that "If you have had kids, then your parents have had kids." The converse statement, however, is obviously empirically false, so order matters here. Hence, we'd naturally disregard any alternative kind of conditional operator that fails to distinguish order. 

One of the reasons Wittgenstein thought the exclusive use of ostensive definition failed was because it opened the possibility that a given symbol's meaning was sourced from whatever sensation someone was having at the time, so that a symbol's meaning was whatever seemed to be the case to the private linguist. He then concluded that in this situation truth and falsity couldn't be rationally talked about. This point was made because Wittgenstein thought that the values of truth and falsity could only apply to cases where the one or the other could actually be applied. In other words, Wittgenstein thought that only symbols that could be doubted could have meaning and the values 'truth' and 'falsity' applied to them. But why is this? It seems to be the case that Wittgenstein thought that otherwise what was being dealt with was a tautology, where the sense of meaning was lost. But couldn't there be other meaningful self-evident sort of statements where what's occurring isn't a tautology and where it wouldn't be reasonable nor conceivable to doubt? 

Suppose someone is about to flip a coin, but beforehand asks you guess heads or tails. The question "What side will the coin land on?" is a question about the future, and it's essentially impossible to predict the answer for a fair coin. Ergo, what side lands up is unknowable. HOWEVER, "what side lands up?" is not unknowable. That is, just because a question's answer is unknowable doesn't mean that the question itself is unknowable. Here's the fallacious argument again: The question is "What side lands up?"; what side lands up is unknowable; ergo, the question is unknowable. What the argument is apparently trying to do is apply the transitive property of identity (if A is B and B is C, then A is C), a mistake which might be easy to make if you just hear the argument spoken verbally, because B can sound just like "B?". Written down, though, the syntactical difference is unambiguous. The above fallacy might be called a use-mention equivocation fallacy. 

Quine, like many others before him, thought that the meaning of words depends on the context they are in. But what compelled Quine to hold that in light of this there is an ambiguity as to what any given word references? Couldn't someone admit that the same word can reference different things in different contexts while still holding that reference is a viable aspect of language? What else logically motivated Quine to conclude that there is no fact of the matter about what any word references besides the fact that words' referents are context-dependent? 

Wittgenstein is stated as having said "we must do away with the explanation and description alone must take its place" (PI 109). But isn't this akin to the myth of the given that Sellars attacked? Can a clear distinction really be made between providing a description and providing an explanation? Doesn't the one effectively permeate the other? One example that comes to mind that seems to leave the two interconnected is the description of a banana being thrown in the air. We might describe the situation as Jim throwing the banana, or causing the banana to be thrown, into the air. But here the description of the event, namely Jim hurling the banana into the air, is inclusive of two events, the event of Jim with a banana in his hand, and the event of the little banana hurling through the air (probably much to its dissatisfaction). But, in this way, there is the occurrence of an explanation of an event within the mere 'description' of an event, the explanation being the induction of causality. Indeed, so long as there is a certain ambiguity in what single 'event' we might be offering a description of and in what circumstances we offer a description of it, it seems to be the case that any given event can give way to be an explanation just as much as it can a description. For example, when a detective asks 'what happened here?', you as a witness might give him the rundown on what happened. And yet, you are both describing what happened, insofar as you are recounting what happened, and offering an explanation, insofar as you are clarifying the situation for the person asking what happened. So there is a continuity in some cases between description and assertion, dependent on the context in which one states the occurrences of a given event. As a last bit of inquiry, is Wittgenstein's criticisms of explanation (insofar as it is a criticism of 'private states of meaning' perverting what is simply observed of 'public behavior') similar in any way to Hume's criticism of induction? Both seem to me to be criticizing a mental sort of behavior that impedes or contorts the naturalistic (or simply 'natural') experiences and observances made in our ordinary course of life. 

As a matter of fact there is a standard term for those propositions which are always true under any interpretation: tautologies. The mirror image as you say of a true contradiction is a false tautology. 

And it wouldn't stop there. This process actually can be carried out ad infinitum. And are precursors of vector spaces and related structures of modern linear algebra. 

Key word being IF the usual laws are available. In saying that, you just reaffirmed the truth of the very same p∨¬p that you presently are hypothesizing to be false. By the law of non-contradiction: ⊢ ¬(ϕ ∧ ¬ϕ) Hence, replacing ϕ with (p∨¬p), it follows that ⊢ ¬[(p ∨ ¬p) ∧ ¬(p ∨ ¬p)]. Option A) Let the whole darn thing explode by accepting that both LNC and its negation are both true. "Yes I absolutely accept the Law of Non-contradiction, and violations of it are impossible. Yes, violations of it also exist. And yes, I'm fine with that." Option B) Our original question was what if LEM wasn't true, but we leaped straight to investing what happens if it was false. But if LEM is not true, we don't have to take that to mean it must be false any more since the middle isn't being excluded.
