I'm running CentOS 6.3 x64 on a Dell PowerEdge R520. I have run the following two commands as per This Wiki 

the page doesn't resolve. When I try to access the webpage from the physical server, I am presented with a page that has 4 boxes and a question mark. Any Help Is Much Appreciated. EDIT: Apparently I suck a QA-ing. The problem was what when I tried to access the OMSA webpage for my server from another machine, the page would be "unable to load". But, if I open a web browser while I'm at the server that I have OMSA installed on, then I am presented with a page containing four boxes and a question mark. Turns out that I just didn't have the appropriate ports open. My apologies to you all for not being clear and thank you all for your help. 

Can anyone help me find the proper syntax for the regex that I need for this to work? I'm not a regex expert by any means. I'm probably just doing something simple wrong. Any help you can provide is most appreciated. 

And it has yielded that I am, as I suspected, missing the dependencies that I accidentally removed. But, I'm not quite sure how to install all the missing dependencies (as there are quite a few, I would like to install them all at once.) and restore VirtualBox to its original state. Can anyone offer some advice? I have tried just a yum install of VirtualBox 4.2, but to no avail. Thanks 

It appears as though my mail server is interpreting the "h=mime" line as a command. After some research, I followed this thread: 

But the weird thing is, the mail still goes through... Upon inspection of my maillogs, I see lines similar to: 

parameter to my /etc/postfix/main.cf file, then added some regex to the bogus_commands file to try and replace any command beginning with 

I run into this error every time I try to update (CentOS 6) on four different servers. It only happens with this package. After researching the problem, I haven't been able to find any useful info. People have had very similar problems to this, but not this particular one. Can anyone offer me any advice on how to fix this issue? 

I have a brand new Dell VRTX box set up as a Failover Cluster running HA Hyper-V virtual machines. This is my first time setting up clustering, and my first time with one of these boxes, so I'm sure I've missed something. The virtual machines are experiencing high disk latency and bad performance when accessing their VHD(x) files located on a Cluster Shared Volume. The VRTX has 10 x 900 GB 10K SAS drives in RAID 6 configuration, and the VRTX has the redundant Shared PERC 8 controllers. Both blades have full access to the virtual disks. There are two M520 blades installed, each with 128 GB RAM. MPIO is configured for the PERC 8 controllers. Operating system on the blades is Server 2012 (NOT R2). The RAID 6 array is split into a small (8 GB) volume for cluster quorum witness and a large (6.5 TB) volume for a Cluster Shared Volume (mounted on the nodes as C:\ClusterStorage\Volume1) An example of slow disk access: logging into a Server 2012 VM and having Server Manager come up automatically. Disk access goes to 100%, with write speeds at 20 MB or so, read speeds of 500 KB or so, and Average Response Time of over 1000 ms, sometimes spiking at 4000-5000 ms or so. It's the latency that really worries me. Is there something specific I should look at in my configuration? It doesn't seem to matter whether I use VHD or VHDX, dynamic or static. 

But I have one router where the FastEthernet0 interface is not initializing IPv6 properly. The IPv6 addresses stay at tentative status: 

It turns out that Windows 2003 Domain Controllers will not accept IPv6 subnets in Sites and Services. After adding a 2008 R2 domain controller, I was able to add IPv6 subnets. But I also found out that running IPv6 on Windows 2003 does not work out very well, especially with Exchange in the mix. 

The LAN between the Cisco and the Firewall has (for example, not actual) , and the rest of is distributed among the other sites. Currently, the Cisco router is advertising on the LAN, and the Linux Firewall is not advertising anything. As a result, the Cisco advertises itself as the default gateway, and sends any Internet-bound traffic to the Cisco router first, then gets redirected to the Firewall by the Cisco router. Is there a better way to do this? I'd like to be able to advertise to the LAN that should be directed towards the Cisco router, but the default gateway should be the Linux Firewall. Is this possible with stateless autoconfig? The Cisco router's current interface config: 

As the question states, what are the drawbacks of making every capable Windows 2003 or 2008 Server in my organization a domain controller for the domain? Is it just overkill? Will many 3rd party applications explode? Something else I'm not thinking of? Are there any advantages? 

Can anyone suggest an alternative to the Windows Remote Desktop Client for Windows 2000 Professional that will allow for a screen resolution larger than the fixed 1600 x 1200? I am trying to get to 1920x1080. The target server is Windows Server 2003. Thanks! 

I am adding a new basic disk partition to my Exchange 2007 Windows Server 2003 64bit server to add more storage groups. It is a RAID 1 Array. I know Exchange 2007 has it's own search indexing service, which is on by default and needed. On clients, I always disable the indexing service on the drives by either disabling the Windows Search service or unchecking the "Allow Indexing Service to index this disk for fast file searching" checkbox in the drive properties window. I do this because, in my experience, the index service just eats up resources and turning it off generally isn't even noticeable to the users. I cannot find any documentation regarding this service and if it would affect Exchange 2007 mailboxes and storage groups if it is disabled. Right now it is enabled on the new drive, but the drive is completely empty as of right now. Can I disable it or should I not worry about it? Any performance gains I can gain are always welcome. Thanks! 

Take a look at this link and see if it helps you out: $URL$ It is for SQL Compact 3.5 though. Quoted below from this link: $URL$ 

We thought it was the windows advanced firewall, but it is turned completely off on the server. Then we thought it was our Sonicwall rules, but they are almost exactly the same as the existing one we use. We cannot find any place that is blocking port 25. The new NAT rule also has ZERO traffic statistics, so it doesn't look like anything is even getting off of the new server to use the NAT rule. We have tried IISRESET and stopping and starting the SMTP server multiple times. The test always fails with the error 10061. My Google fu has gotten me nowhere. Is it possible that Windows Server 2012 R2 could still be blocking outgoing traffic on port 25, even though the firewall is turned off? What are we missing?
