Please, give assessments of my types of formations from different perspectives: humanistic, liberal, Realpolitik, and economical. Which transition scenarios between different formations can be envisaged? Which scenarios of clashes between such formations (both of similar or dissimilar structure) will be plausible? 

Let’s consider the typical setting of 20th-century science fiction writers, both Western and Communist. Namely: 

A violent agent that is stronger economically or militarily, or enjoys an external (interstellar) support, subjugates its neighbourhood, depriving planets of any external sovereignty, and (in case of a victorious government) possibly annexes and colonizes them outright. Some combination of planetary (domestic) sovereignty and a centralized “interstellar superpower” controlling outer space and space trade, likely by space navy, but restraining from conquest and extortion of developed planets in its space (think various “great unions of planets” in fiction). A confederacy of racially diverse and economically rivalling states seeking primarily to deter wars, to protect their common outer space from piracy and invaders, and to resist a blatant external interference in general (think Iroquois League, with a correction for racial diversity). An advanced interstellar system of relations, based on numerous treaties, maintains a complicated political balance and legal space in a large volume of physical space (along the lines of United Nations and Earth’s superpowers, or other known systems of international relations). A huge democracy effects a (nominally) undivided sovereignty over a large volume of space. An oligarchy of industrial or merchant corporations, with their space fleets, suppresses and subordinates weak territorial- and/or racial-based governments (popular or else). Some novel form of government based on a powerful conscious agent: specially designed governing computer (likely distributed), collective consciousness of individuals, or some mental power we now can’t explicate. Makes the problem of “sovereignty” moot. No stable structure at all: persistent wars, coups, rebellions, alliances and infightings, ever expanding and fragmenting empires and dictatorships. 

Gender roles would likely be much different, because in the world you describe, people of the same sex must be able to reproduce with each other, whereas in our current set up, that is not possible. Given that our real-world gender roles are formed around (but not necessarily by) the fact that one sex is capable of giving birth, and one is not, I imagine that there would be a less distinct gender difference in the world you describe. This makes me think that "gender" --as we define it currently-- would not exist in your world; the biological reason for sexual dimorphism to develop must necessarily not exist in your world, given that there is a non-zero probability of two members of the same sex having an offspring together. Also, from a genetics standpoint, over time the relative populations (XX) and (Xx) will shrink, because there is a higher likelihood of being born as (xx). While I will not say that these populations would vanish (though I suspect they would as reproductive rates are fairly low) I will say that the gene pools for (XX) and (Xx) will not be as diverse as they should be, creating a genetically inferior sex. If this is what you mean by gender role, then it could be explored in more depth, but I argue at this step that what we are discussing is no longer "gender." 

I'm going to suggest 2 items, a spear type weapon (ie melee, no ammo requirements, and allows to keep a bit of distance) plus a disabling weapon such as a net, bolas or lasso. Against a lot of zombies, you only really have 1 option - be like Brave Sir Robin and run away as fast as you can, but this applies to most scenarios with most equipment. Against 1 zombie, get him tangled up in something so he's on the ground and not going anywhere or able to be much of a threat, and then you can walk up to him and stab him with your spear in the relevant places until he stops wriggling. (a machete or other short sword might be a good thing to include just for completeness). 

No, of course not. You could have super-intelligent aliens who either don't bother to develop at all beyond what they immediately need because they have no 'ambition' but can have whatever tools are needed for any task at hand - so an aggressive species could stumble across a completely peaceful world and next thing you know, the clever but peaceful aliens have produced a whole heap of war machines. I'm particularly thinking of the moties in Niven's Mote in God's Eye novel, but they had a different character flaw - one of constant reproduction that led to overpopulation, war and social destruction. But they were really good at making whatever tools were needed for a task/ So, given alternative motives or impulses for these aliens, you can skip straight to the good stuff without having to slowly invent better and better tooling. That said, you could let them get better tools by default - we built stone, then copper, then iron etc because we invented these things. If your aliens had, say, super-strong plants that could be trained to grow in certain shapes, you could go straight to the 'iron age' (or the plant equivalent with iron-strength leaves when they grow to maturity in shaped moulds built around young plants), or plants trained to grow into the structures we eventually learned to build out of iron. 

Which political structure can be sufficiently stable in such conditions? Very likely, a typical developed planet or other astronomical object will not have significant pieces belonging to more than one sovereign state (that does not preclude some states to extend authority to several planets), and, in most situations in outer space, a state will maintain its sovereignty over its spaceships. I.e., a situation similar to modern Earth with planets/moons instead of islands (divided planets will become an anomalous condition), and spaceships instead of vessels. On one hand, different planets in a stellar system typically have different physical conditions (most notable, temperature), and we can expect that their populace will differ (remember several civilized races) as well, both biologically and culturally. On another hand, some central authorities will probably exist in circumstellar spaces. But how the two could be related in cases of heterogeneous populace in vicinity of one star? Some possible formations are: 

Reading through the comments I am having a tough time figuring out if this thread is still active, but I do have a few ideas. Firstly, you ask what must be changed to follow some form of logic? As noted, magic usually isn't very logically, however I understand what you mean by this and to me it seems like an additional (9th) domain might be useful (since 7 doesn't seem to work as you mentioned in the comments) to ensure some sort of balance. That is, a rock-paper-scissors mechanic. The main reason to use an RPS mechanic is to make sure that no single ability, or any combination thereof, is head-and-shoulders better than the others. If this were the case, there would be no real reason to ever use the other spirits, or for that matter include them in your world, thus my suggestion to add a 9th. A functioning rock-paper-scissors mechanic can only work with an odd number of features. The ability to bind multiple spirits complicates the system, but the combinatorics exist to sort the problem out. My initial suggestion to simplify things here would be to only allow 3 spirits at any given time. This works well as a multiple of 9, and still gives an 24-, 12-, 8-hour time span feature as you mentioned. Should you decide to go that route and run into a specific problem developing a balanced scheme, that may make for an excellent follow-up question. As far as which domains must be added to cover the whole spectrum of a human being? my initial thought was to add a creativity/ingenuity type category, but it would be hard to specify what exactly that might do, especially for the malevolent spirit. One idea that does seem to flow would be an Emotion category. The benevolent spirit would add empathy and the ability to relate to people, thus making them more likely to support your cause. The malevolent form would make you cold hearted and distant, which may be useful for making those "tough" decisions. Just an idea. One other thing: the malevolent Appearance spirit doesn't seem fitting. Instead what if that spirit made you intimidating to others. People would be scared of you and thus less likely to oppose you, but also less likely to support your efforts. 

They say that something is only worth what you can get for it. In a modern economy of scale many small items get a price set by the market so it appears that there is a 'value' for everything but this is only the case because of the liquidity of currency that is available. But for more expensive items this can break down (a little). You can see this when prices can be negotiated considerably, such as house prices in a downturn or in a boom. There's no fixed price they rise or fall dramatically. The same applies to such a primitive economy. When you arrive with a suit of armour in tow, it can not be worth more than someone else has to offer. No matter what the guide book price might be at the big city that the Armourers to the King would charge you, if you have to sell it to a man who only has 3 silver pieces, then 3 silver pieces is all you can get. In a town as described this might not be money at all but other goods (as barter). The other aspect is value to the inhabitants. A suit of armour may be nice and shiny, but if you're starving, its worthless. Like trying to sell a Ferrari to a place that has no gas. Nobody will take it off your hands, or they might offer you $10 so they can keep their chickens in it. So what would happen in such a place is that the possessions of the inhabitants would increase where they possessed high-ticket-price items, but would not consider them as wealth. A bit like the Aztecs who had so much gold that they considered it just a worthless shiny metal and were happy to trade large quantities of it far in excess of what the early Spanish explorers considered it to be worth. (which is another lesson. If civilisation is every contacted again, and every town inhabitant has 3 magic swords holding up their washing lines, traders will quickly appear to trade goods worth something to the inhabitants for those items. Want a magic sword? It might only cost you a bag of turnips at this town) Some RPG games try to model this as inflation - a suit of armour is worth 100gp but after you're delivered 5 suits to the local smith, the price drops to 50gp. This doesn't reflect reality, and a better way to model it is in terms of the smith's stock and access to raw materials. However, such a system is complex and requires a lot of book-keeping.
