Your unwanted guests will drop through the carefully disguised trapdoor and be liquidized before you know it. The environmentally friendly option to dispose of unwanted callers, you can fertilize your roses with the remains! Ok, I admit - that's not hand held. The idea just popped into my head though. :) 

It seems to me that the aliens would have access to our broadcasts, and be able to monitor our television and radio not just after they arrive but while they are approaching. Sufficiently advanced computing technology would have translation software working by the time they reached orbit. Once in orbit they can also try and piggy back into the Internet by reverse engineering the protocols and intercepting some satellite up-links. Between these two sources of information it shouldn't take them long to understand our political makeup and work out who would be appropriate to contact depending on their long term goals. 

A few ideas, I'm not sure how viable they all are: Spin Changes The planet formed and cooled spinning very rapidly as a result it had a flattened rather than spherical shape. It then captured a large moon nearly as large as itself, the resulting tidal forces slowed the spin down drastically (and led to some interesting times for anyone alive at the time). The slowed spin meant that the poles were now significantly lower effective gravitational level and the water drained down into them, filling them with water. This would give massive circular oceans at each pole. Near miss A large planetary body came very close to striking but in fact only skimmed the surface then headed back out into space. The glancing blow ripped out a huge chunk of land (unfortunately unlikely to be circular but less devastating than a direct impact). Headshot A very dense body (for example black hole or neutron star) punched clean through the planet taking out a huge chunk of material as it did and then continued on across the solar system. The rest of the planet then collapsed into the void and you had some pretty extreme geology for a while afterwards but ironically by just removing large amounts of material cleanly it might do less damage to the rest of the planet than a conventional meteorite impact would do. 

You are right that this isn't steampunk, it's certainly an interesting world-building possibility though. This is something that has been looked at numerous times throughout fiction and RPGs so you can certainly find elements for inspiration in all sorts of places. For example Numenera, Babylon 5, Against a Dark Background, even Fallout. At least initially the famous Arthur C. Clarke quote would apply "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic". The wizards of the time would use the scraps of technology without understand. The mystic incantation "ok google" that activates the demon in the box. Some technology would reveal itself more easily, anything mechanical in particular can at least be understood if not duplicated. The existence of scientific records, or scraps of them, would allow faster progress in many areas - but so much of what is described would be meaningless without the context to back it up. 

You could have an earthquake cause the land to split and then drop down where the city is. Essentially the plates would shift and start moving apart, creating a subduction zone where the city is. It would be fairly violent but you could make it more slow and steady rather than sudden and violent and still be vaguely plausible. There is a hell of a lot about plate tectonics that we still do not understand which gives an author a lot of wriggle room to come up with things. 

The problem you will have is the absolutely ridiculous cold and lack of any energy source. Life needs a source of energy in order to be able to do anything. Even on earth our best cold adapted life is limited to -15 or -20 degrees celsius. We're not aware of any life based on other substances that are liquid at much lower temperatures, but that does not mean it could not exist. We just don't know. Assuming carbon/water is the only option for life though then the only realistic way to get temperatuers high enough at this distance from the sun is geothermal in a planet or tidal heating in a moon. How viable that is would depend very much on the nature and composition of the planet. 

This question cannot be answered as we simply do not know. We have a sample set of 1 - us. Based on that sample set the answer is 4.5 billion years, however we have no idea what factors would make that a much shorter or much longer time. 

What is the market price of anything? What people are prepared to pay for it. If the planet offers nothing of valuable then people will pay nothing. If the planet holds some unobtanium material not found anywhere else then they will pay anything. Most planets will fall somewhere in between but the point isn't to have a list of potentially valuable things. The point is to work out how much someone is willing to pay. 

The problem with knowledge of the future is that as soon as you make one alteration the future starts to change. Knowledge of one lottery result would be fine, but results after that would rapidly become unpredictable again. One of the comments is absolutely right though, start by winning the lottery, just send yourself back with a bit of money and a false identity. Additionally send yourself back in time to shortly before a major disaster and use your lottery winnings to avert it and to invest in a number of companies that you know will grow large. You can also bring back a suitable list of inventions to use your lottery seed money to start working from. With that level of money and influence you can then not try to convince people, just get them to do what you want without ever mentioning being a time traveler. If you really want to convince people though then use natural events that will still happen predictably. For example if you know a major earthquake is going to strike new york at 9:13am on Wed 4th August then use your money to place billboards warning people and to place relief shelters and supplies ready. That will get people listening. 

Think Venice (but with the water kept clean and non-polluted). The city could actually be built out over the sea so regular currents go through the canals to keep them clean. Alternatively if the merfolk can breath and survive in fresh water then rivers could be channeled through the city to help keep it clean. The lower parts of the buildings would actually be underwater and have structures, rooms, etc inside them. They would be used by the merfolk while the upper parts would be above the water and used by the humans. The merfolk would travel on the canals or use carts/palanquins to travel the roads. Humans would travel on the roads and use gondolas to travel the canals. Markets and shared common areas would be similar but on a smaller scale, with ornamental streams or channels sized for merfolk while paths and small bridges sized for humans go above. Split property ownership could well be common, with merfolk owning the underwater section and humans owning the dry land section. Children could play together with shallow water areas being popular, deep enough for merchildren to swim but shallow enough for human children to stand. They could well even develop their own custom games that need a mix of both human and merfolk on both teams. 

The first of these is probably the main one, as life has adapted to many extremes of pressure. We don't know of any organic material capable of surviving these conditions though - let alone viable lifeforms. 

You've set a very hard problem here, since as described it society will be rather Utopian. You're going to need to look for cracks or edge cases. For example perhaps people who are not enhanced might be looked down on, treated like pets or sub-human. Look at the film Gattaca for an excellent treatment of this concept. Alternatively someone may decide that perfect happiness means that no-one is allowed to be hurt or sad ever. Any hint of unhappiness gets you dragged in for "a talk" with nice people with drugs and therapists who don't let you go until all the sadness is gone. You can see how that could be Dystopian, and could become very oppressive. There are all sorts of other takes on this theme you might tackle as well. Basically the "bad guys" are doing this for your own good, whether you want it or not! 

There did exist such a thing as wooden cannons They were notoriously weak though and were usually only good for a few shots before bursting, however you could hypothesize something similar being made from large bones and sinew. For personal firearms again you could do something similar but the gun would be more likely to explode than fire and you would have terrible accuracy. Firearms are unlikely to develop simply because you cannot make them consistent enough or strong enough unless you hypothesize that the prey animals have extremely strong bones or the natives in question develop some way to strengthen them. Considering how much they would be working with bones as a raw material it would make sense that they know how to get the most out of them. For example a bone wrapped in sinew and soaked in some special liquid X (just invent a name) for a week then wrapped again and dusted with powder Y then allowed to dry hardens into an extremely strong material. They can then work that material to produce the equivalent of old-school muzzle loading firearms and produce cannons with similar effectiveness to metal ones. If you don't want to do that then for personal combat something like bows would be your best bet. They can be built from bones and sinew and arrows can also be made from those materials. For larger scale conflicts then catapults and trebuchet could in theory be made if you have access to large enough bones and/or good ways to bind them together. 

In a magical/fantasy universe then it's easy enough as you say to just explain it away using magic. There's no need even to go into details, but you can either say the laws of the universe work differently, or use a less direct explanation like saying for example that the planet is hollow (and held together/supported by the magic). In a true fantasy universe you can have the planet any shape you like, including flat. :) 

Considering most communication systems evolved from early warning where rapid spread and reaction was important (for example warning cries that a predator is approaching) then DNA would not be a suitable mechanism to do so. Something like an ant colony would be more likely to evolve along these lines though, as they already use chemical signaling and close-contact communication. For example the queen might compose orders to the workers in the form of DNA strands and then hand them out to be acted on. Scouts might synthesize the report on their way back to the base and then use them to report, etc. 

This is a follow-on question from: How alien can a language be - grammar? Leaving the grammar behind we can look at how the actual words or concepts are transmitted. Almost all human languages are based around stringing together sequences of phonemes (sounds). There are exceptions (various sign languages for example) but those are used only when sound is not available due to circumstances such as deafness or a need for silence. So my question is what is the most believable ways, other than stringing together phonemes, that could evolve in a naturally occurring intelligent species? In other words how could they communicate with each other? Note that this would be the primary communication method so either should have an advantage over using phonemes or a reason why phonemes aren't used. 

I've heard of Chinese Paper Armour that was made by laminating sheets of paper. Mythbusters even did an episode testing it out. The results are summarized here where they say: 

One thing to keep in mind here is that you've given defenders a massive advantage. Having choke points that can be easily fortified and where forces can be concentrated is a defender's dream. In contrast to the top voted answer (which I up voted) I argue that actually army sizes are going to make much less difference than it does in our world. If only 10 people can get down a tunnel at once then whether you have 100 people or 100,000 people behind them makes much less difference than if the 100,000 can swarm you from all directions. Invasion would focus on stealth tactics to capture the defensive points by surprise or on digging new tunnels to bypass them. Defense would consist of multiple levels of defenses each arranged to deal as much damage as possible and culminating in completely collapsing the tunnel (ideally with the invading force still inside it). "special forces" would be a really big deal here. If one special forces unit can capture a chokepoint and let your army flood into the city then they would achieve more than doubling the size of your army would. 

Ice is strange, in that the solid form is less dense than the liquid water it freezes from. This causes Ice to float on top of the water. How would our planet earth be different if something changed this property of Ice so that it became significantly denser than water. Dense enough to sink to the bottom. Would the poles freeze up completely? How would the climate and life be affected? 

Most religions (but not all) start from a figure similar to the followers of the religion - i.e. human like. They then make them larger, to suggest more power and presence. They often then add animal or other non-human features (A Jackal's head, extra arms, etc) in order to emphasize that they are not humans but a completely different order of beings. But really this can go in any direction. They may be smaller (fey), larger (titans), abstract (holy spirit), animal spirits, etc. So you have a lot of freedom. Start from the religion itself, work out what that religion wants. Do they want a fearsome god to make their enemies tremble? Then think of ways to achieve that. Do they want a god of peace and love? Then how do you achieve that?
