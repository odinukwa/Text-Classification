Sometimes there are people in the interview process who don't fully understand the details of the compensation packages. "Of course anyone with your title automatically gets company stock after one year." They may mean well, but this could be a promise they can't keep. Who can remember all the little promises made during a lengthy interview process? Contracts aren't guarantees, but they can offer clarity assuming both sides understand the wording and/or are trying do the right thing in the spirit of the contract and not use it as a tool to screw the other person over. 

I think there are two things you need to cover: A) What is your boss's expectations of you in regards to educating this person? Is making it clear this person is not qualified an option? Does anyone realize how much time you're spending/wasting? Make sure this intern isn't a relative of someone. B) Have a conversation with the intern. What is his expectations? Does he realize how far behind he is? He may understand more, but is very intimidated in these one on one training sessions. He really does need to consider his future in this profession because the training you're offering isn't going to always be made available to him. You may be doing all parties of favor and suggesting a different line of work. I can't imagine this is a pleasant experience for the intern. The company is wasting resources that they may not be aware of. If you can't get out of it for whatever reason, make the best of it. Back off on your expectations. Slow down and do a lot of reviewing. You never know, things may just click. Stranger things have happened. 

Meetings should be sent using a calendar item and not an email. This way they can respond and have a reminder set all at once. Technology is not your problem. There are no consequences when people don't do as they are told that are effectively changing their behavior. Who's in charge? 

You can give it a try and see what happens or just ask someone who's been around a little longer. Maybe it's a pet-peeve of one of the higher ups. If there's no one there you feel comfortable asking this type of question, you have some bigger issues working at this company. 

This is not a given and will test your ability to influence people. If after 6 months and you have nothing additional to offer your company, should they fire you? There could be a situation where a company is struggling to find someone to maintain a legacy code base in an unpopular language. If they allow time to work on other areas, it could be good compromise. 

Don't state you're going to follow-up and ask for an interview. Indicate you want to make sure the resume was received. Maybe even to find out the timeframe of the interview process. This was a good idea when you had to snail mail your resume. You just wanted to make sure the post office didn't lose it. The real motive is to make contact and show them some initiative. If you email an individual, it is a good practice to now see if they got if, but is this person on vacation or something that may delay what you think is a normal amount of time to start interviews. 

Usually when given notice, there is some time available to clean up these types of things. The goal should be to leave your job better than you found it: 

As others have posted, the key is to show you can still do the job and you have some recent negative experiences. Mitigate your boss's fears. Make sure you work out a detailed plan with your boss, so she knows this isn't permanent-think of it as a trial period. If you can't accomplish certain things, you will lose this privilege. For most supervisors, feeling like they're stuck with a decision along with "everyone will want to do it" concerns make them inclined to say no. Listen carefully while you have this discussion. It may take more than one meeting as you figure-out how to alleviate any concerns you didn't think of. Don't expect to solve this problem all at once. Feeding your child is important to you so let them know this will motivate you to make this work. Prove Yourself. Start working from home as soon as possible for a very short trial-run. Work on a personal, sick, vacation, holiday if necessary. Being in a union may limit how or what you can barter with, so I don't know if you can offer to shorten your maternity leave. Your boss may not require time limits, but you should put them on your work. Make plans and let people know when you will have things ready even if they don't ask. Follow-up on your work and get feedback from them, "Did I get this to you in time? Is there anything else I can do?" I realize you want to be there for every feeding, but you may have to compromise that to keep this job. Can you do partial days or shift your office hours just a little so you make most of the feedings? Could a caregiver drop by the office on a lunch break with your child for a feeding? All of these solutions do not solve your exact problem, but I hope if you're not able to work from home the whole time, there are some minimal trade-offs that you can try. 

I think consultants are different than working with fellow employees. They do charge higher rates and are there as a "hired-gun." Typical office/social norms don't all apply. You may want to have a conversation with your supervisor about this and just ask if you should consider this person as just another one of your team mates. If you had an office party, would this person be invited? The nature of expensive hourly billing usually puts management on the defensive and sometimes they may not want you to disturb this person at all for fear of wasting money. If they are not too concerned with forcing this person to work for every billable hour, then say nothing. Otherwise, you do have an obligation to speak up if the company doesn't approve of this behavior. If someone delivers one package are you going to sign-off on an invoice that indicates there should be two? Would it be acceptable for the delivery person to tell you he's keeping the other box in his truck so he can sell it on Ebay later? 

Be honest and direct about where this person is, but also, let him know what is required to get to the salary level he suggested. He may disagree with your assessment, so make sure you've looked into this carefully. Using one other person's salary as a data point, is not a valid argument. You could probably look through job postings with lower salaries than what you're offering (If not, maybe you do not offer competitive wages?). 

Hopefully in any interview you're not asked to provide unsubstantiated or non-professional opinions on anything, so don't offer them. You offered a professional opinion on the best way to prepare a web developer is to teach more skills focused on that area. This boss disagreed. Your boss probably was being defensive about his school, but he did offer a professional opinion shared by many that a university should provide a theoretical foundation for software development and not focus "too" much on specific skills. I believe many feel there were too many "Java" schools out there. It is difficult to know what languages or frameworks will be popular over the next few years. It is also difficult to research and redesign the courses ever year or so. Don't get distracted by the emotions. Both of you were guilty of this. You should have asked what other areas should be the focus for this position. Hopefully he would explain why this would help rather than how schools are catering to students with easier subject matter. He should research this defense a little better instead of relying on business buzzwords like low-hanging fruit. 

Bob is on contract. I hope his leaving early doesn't mean he is fudging on his hours. Sorry, but in the big scheme of things, either everyone accommodates Bob, or he has to find someone else to pick up his kids. Ultimately, he may have to get a different job. Not much you can do about all this. Either take action, or just keep enabling Bob. 

Almost every payslip I've ever received included year-to-date information. I check for accuracy and only keep the most recent for the last slip from each job for any tax and/or calendar year. Again, this assumes all necessary information is aggregated correctly. 

Focus on everything you did in those two years to look like to crammed 3 years into it. How long did it take before you started working on your first project? Some places may not have new hires working on production code for months. 

You are aware of these and have used them on your own time. You are open to change and willing to learn new things. You have a proven track record of being able to learn new technologies. 

Don't say you're looking for another job because it is always understood that anyone can leave at any time for any reason. Hit the lottery, get hit by a bus, move to the mountains to be a monk. Anything can happen. It sounds like you were a good employee and the company had some plans for you. Sure there is a risk you could leave, but management doesn't need to be explicitly told this. They cut their losses and avoiding getting any deeper with you into projects only to have you leave. If you could convert the lesser developers to doing things your way, there would be a tremendous brain drain to have you leave. Maybe they would all be better than before, but who knows? Everybody thinks the: 10x-super-ninja-rockstar coder gets that way just by writing great code: absolutely wrong. Their talents are leveraged by convincing management to structure applications their way. They attract other good coders to come and work on their team. They make the coders around them better. You set an example, help people when they need it, and prevent the entire team/company from making disastrous technical choices. None of this will EVER happen in one year. Your task as a highly-skilled developer was to make the project better by making others better and not writing fancy-ass code in bleeding edge technology for world-saving projects. When you eventually build something great, you will find yourself surrounded by good people doing good things. 

This sounds like a knee-jerk reaction to some incident. I don't think telling your boss you're not reading the email is a good strategy. Indicating you only need a small percentage is a start, but how is everyone going to adjust all their email to determine what you need? Not an easy task. Look for ways to take your 20+ group and form smaller groups. This makes it easier for everyone to learn what email needs to go where. This could be a compromise for your boss to know things aren't falling through the cracks. An ideal situation would be to get off of email for these purposes. You need some document site, wiki or other place to post this information. Then users can get updates when the content is updated. Users can setup their own notifications for particular threads/conversations/files, etc. What are you going to do when new person is added to the group? I hope they're not going to get bombarded with a year's worth of email. 

There are places where salaries are open and usually linked to some sort of objective criteria for advancement: level of education and years of experience. Some people like this and others don't. In an environment where there is some perception of merit pay, everybody will argue that they are the best. Surveys show most people believe they are above average, so now no one is happy and you end up with some sort of fixed pay scale. I say, go look for another job and see what you can make. Yes, you'll find some places are more enjoyable than others. You won't know for sure how many hours a day will be expected or levels of stress induced, available resources or whether or not you'll end up liking your coworkers. In the US, things like cars, houses and health insurance are made so complicated that it is difficult to compare any two of them. Then throw in the range of negotiation and you have a mess. Personally, it is none of your business what I make. That may put both of us at a disadvantage. Who knows? Search for what you want. Ask for what you think you're worth and willing to tolerate and hope you never find out someone with equal or lesser talent makes more than you because you'll end up making yourself miserable and will still feel slighted even if you do get a raise. 

Of course this is a vague comment and your boss probably doesn't have a lot of data to support this claim but you don't have any to dispute it either. When you're given something to do, you should provide a time estimate whether your boss asks for one or not. Get some feedback on whether or not this is fast enough. Maybe there are factors that need to be considered before you agree on a time-frame. Even if there isn't an approval process, you have a document indicating the time estimate and your boss hasn't indicated it's too slow. Then all you have to do is meet these due dates. 

The client can approve to pay for more hours. The company pays for the extra hours. You work the extra hours for free. 

The two of you should sit down and discuss these possibilities and be open for others. This person wants to be a better programmer working in a better job. The definition of this will constantly evolve as does technology, ability and development needs of the company. Put this person into the position that they write code so well, it would be insane to have them do anything else. Convince the "powers that be" that this is a rare and priceless thing. 

No way to determine that. If your company were in New Orleans, LA, everybody likes a party. Step out on that Second Line! It's like determining if anything else is a motivator, does it make a difference in getting the desirable outcome? Make some evaluation on how "motivated" people were at the start of your projects with and without a party. Feel fee to give it a score of 1-10 (Basically a Likert Scale). Decide which is better. If you're not going to throw a party, what are you going to do instead with the time and money? Is that more beneficial? 

I think the other answers are missing the point (Which is not bike shedding.). The culprit is convinced that what they are saying is not only on point with the agenda of the meeting, but it is important. Example: Meeting to discuss color scheme and layout of the corporate website. It is easier for the person leading the meeting to keep people from getting into discussions about content. Not that it is purely black and white, but pretty easy to recognize. What about the person who wants to discuss the thickness of the dividing lines? Isn't that about layout? Maybe, maybe not? Once you feel this topic is heading towards a path of taking too much time, the head of the meeting should be allowed to interrupt and ask Why is this important? What priority does it have? Once you decide it is a low priority, move it to the end and if there is time, discuss it or schedule another meeting. If it is considered too trivial, someone with the deciding vote, just needs to pull rank and either implement it or forget it. If the bike-shedder feels ignored, that is another discussion. You'd like to be equally open to everyone's suggestions, but individuals need to take some responsibility for the quality and relevancy of their suggestions. Use this as an example.
