My guess would be that it would only be worth it if you have skills that are very, very hard to find. Otherwise, most tech recruiters (at least in the US) tend to think more like sales people. They don't see it as a matching problem. They see it as a matter of finding leads. If there's any reason you'll be rejected by a company, they don't want you in their lists of employees to spam at their lists of employers. I would say focus on finding companies that are willing to help you with the legal status issue first and recruiters second. 

If they didn't want you to take vacation they wouldn't give you vacation. The best way to deal with passive aggression which is exactly what comments like these are, is to confront it head on. I'd try something like this: "You keep saying that. Is that about the vacation time I was promised upon being hired for this position and that my manager approves without comment or is there some unstated issue about my work performance here that you feel like we need to discuss?" Confront them. Passive-aggressive types are cowards. They will back right the hell off. If they don't back off, then the company is overrun with the miserable louts and the best advice I can give is do your best to get fired after taking all of your vacation in one nice block. Also if any of the ones who don't want their vacation time has five weeks of it and they need to know a lot about JavaScript, please keep me in the loop if their employment status there should change. I guarantee I'm smarter, probably better-looking and definitely way more pleasant to work with than they are. 

When I realize I really don't have any questions (happens occasionally), my solution to the problem is to basically reiterate my impression of the job the company and the things I find appealing about it or the kind of developer I think they want and then ask the interviewer if they think I have a decent grasp of what they're offering and/or what they're looking for. 

"I don't feel like I'm learning anything new at my current position." That's my stock (and often not untrue) answer when I don't feel like going into the full parade of reasons for searching. But really, if you loved your old job, would you be looking for a new one before you knew for certain the parent company was going to ditch your position? I'd focus on the reasons you were already prepared to leave before the buyout if you had them if finding work at whatever you do isn't particularly difficult. It might help you find a job that's a better fit for you. 

Forget it. There's nothing you can do. The old maxim of worrying only about the things you can control doesn't mean you'll be happier, it means you'll have a clearer understanding of what things that make you miserable are things you can do something about and when it's time to GTFO. Trying to fight the good fight when it's already lost is just a recipe for getting more miserable and burning bridges in my experience. You identify an unacceptable problem you can't fix, you tell your superiors you find it unacceptable and you start looking for a new job. Maybe they'll surprise you and do something about it. Most likely not, however. I'd ask myself the following: 

When you leave for a better job, tell them you were really grossed out by having to wear somebody else's used uniform. Because you're not wrong. It's kind of 'ew.' I'd wear another man's boxers if I knew they were cleaned by somebody more responsible than me. But cleaned by a corporation too cheap to give you a brand new one? Not so much. But I've been in positions where I would have. If it puts food on the table you'll be planning your next steps at, maybe all you need is to clean it yourself to be comfortable with it. 

[yes, no] : Kick them (hard) in the ass. [no, yes] : Acknowledge the error but have a sense of humor about it. [no, no] : Take the time to show the rookie the ropes and point out the nature of the problem. [yes, yes] : "Okay, so what happened?" 

If you're goal is something other than getting hired it might. You can however get at what they know subtly without putting the screws back on them. Like asking for clarity when they're being vague about something you suspect they probably didn't know before Googling for interview questions the night before for instance. But the important thing to remember is that while interviewing really is and should be treated as a two-way sell, you're the one selling talent and they're the ones selling opportunity. Mucking with that it is understandably going to annoy people. 

Recruiters use Google and they use it well. Online resumes are much more important than Word resumes. I used to maintain a Word resume and still occasionally run into people insisting on one. Historically, such people have been a complete waste of time and energy on job searches and I now ignore them with the same happy zeal as people who want you to re-enter all of your resume info into their own form field setup on some site (I wouldn't recommend even Jr level devs waste time on those). 

What he's failing to realize is that they aren't comparing him to you. They're comparing him to what kind of an employee they want for the job. It sounds like he's falling short of their expectations. If you feel you owe him, you might want to give him the advice he needs to hear. "Stop worrying about how you compare to me in their eyes and start worrying about how the employee you are today compares to the employee you were yesterday." This is (I assume) tech. It's not about appearances, it's about results. In a smaller company you can't hide behind your own subpar work by pretending it's somebody else's. If you bring yourself down to his level, you'll both stink and they won't try to secure visas for either of you. If you're both worthwhile, I have no idea why they wouldn't bring both of you on barring an expense that would be enormous compared to the expense of bringing somebody new on and training them up on the codebase as it stands. That strikes me as highly unlikely. He's a lousy employee and he knows it. Whether he gets a visa is maybe still up to him at this point and there's nothing you can do to make him look better by reducing your own chances. If you know where he's weak, and you feel obligated however, you can try to help him get better but it doesn't sound like it's occurred to him that changing his own behavior is something he can or should have to actually do to reach his desired career goals. 

If you've never stayed anywhere for at least a year that would make even me a little skeptical and I haven't stayed anywhere for over a year and a half in the course of a 6 year career. Just make sure you clearly label contracts in your resume so they don't assume you're just getting canned all the time. It's not uncommon for developers at the lower experience levels to do a lot of contract work. Another thing to keep in mind is code culture. I'm a JavaScript dev. We're flighty mercurial bastards and everybody knows it. Java... I think the only time somebody raised an eyebrow at my own resume for being a little jumpy, it was a Java dev. As others have pointed out, it seems like your real problem is that you're not identifying the stinkers before you start working at them. But what you may not have considered is getting them to out their crummy culture for you by trying my patented self-filtering approach by basically committing what a lot of people tell you is interview suicide. Be Excessively Honest About Why You've Jumped Around This might turn your flightiness into an advantage. Tell them point-blank that you're picky and people keep offering you new jobs at points where you get tired of the old ones and that you're hoping to find the right fit for a change because you'd like to get some years+ work on your resume. You obviously don't have problems finding new gigs so it could give a good impression of your skills at the interview. Or they'll decide that you don't have what they think of as "loyalty" which often means they want someone who can trudge daily through pointless mediocrity with no way to correct obvious duh problems with process that are making it impossible for you help them create a more competitive product because management is 100% down-hill with zero reverse-accountability. (not that I'm thinking of anyone specific) But that fits your (likely) goals of not working for wankers so there you have it. At at Least One Point, Tell Them Why They Shouldn't Hire You "Don't hire me if months out from now it seems likely I'll just be perpetually pruning symptoms on a disaster of a code-base rather than actually fixing the real root problems and solving the occasional new one. I get bored and distracted when that's all I'm doing and you won't like me as an employee at monthe #5 of doing that." This level of honesty is something they can't not respond to. Usually when that's the reality of their workday experience they won't try to sell it to you as such but they sure as hell won't hire you when you expressly told them you will suck if they do and that really is the way things are at their workplace even if they only acknowledge it deep down in their subconscious. Be Very Straightforward About What You're Good At and What You're Not Good At This either impresses people or it makes them hate my guts and think I'm an arrogant twit on the one hand and someone who's not serious about trying to get the job on the other. So you'll never work for a total tool/hypocrite who's heavier on judgment than critical thinking basically. More importantly if you have a good self-assessment of your abilities, they'll trust you're being honest about your strengths because everybody tries to downplay their weaknesses and that will make every little bit of evidence corroborating you are what you say you are all the more believable. And once again, they won't hire you to do things you're not good at and don't want to be good at because you told them that you're not and that you don't. Honesty, Honesty, Honesty It's really the core rule. Treat it like a matching process where you want them to know as much about what's not going to work for you as what is, and where you present yourself in such a manner that they might be able to identify that you won't be a fit for them and will simply leave in 2-3 months (because you can and said you had in the past). And that's a good thing. You don't want jobs you're not a good fit for. So stop trying to win the interview. You appear to be a good at that. Just give them every reason they may or may not want to hire you. If you're lucky they might start being equally honest with you. I can only imagine that that's the day I'll find a place I want to work at for 5+ years but the strategy has found me the first jobs that lasted beyond contract-to-hire phases where I wasn't ready to commit sepuku after a few months and stuck it out for a year+.
