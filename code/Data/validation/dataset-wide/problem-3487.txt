I would "advise" to wait... a few more years! From the figure you provided, there is a perhaps slow but visible rising trend (with business-cycles-like "seasonality") for both the long-term and the mid-term unemployment rate, a fairly stable trend in terms of steepness over 60 years. The sudden peak of long term unemployment in 2009 is impressive but it also fell sharply in the next three years. To me, it appears critical to know the unemployment rates for the next four-five years, in order to decide whether we have a structural break with the historical rising trend becoming more steep, or just a few-years-incident due to the crisis. 

The "identically - independently distributed" assumption (or any restriction thereof) on a sample, refers to the relation between random variables in different observations, not between the variables forming the same observation. So in a multidimensional sample "of size $n$" $$\{(y_1, x_{11}, x_{21}),(y_2, x_{12}, x_{22}),...,(y_n, x_{1n}, x_{2n})\}$$ the assumption applies between the variables of observation $i$ and all variables in any other observation. So $y_1$ is assumed independent from, say $y_2$, but it is also assumed indepedent from $x_{12}$. Also $x_{11}$ is assumed independent from $x_{12}$ but also from $x_{22}$, etc. Certainly, $y_i$ is assumed stochastically dependent with $x_{1i}, x_{2i}$, while also $x_{1i}$ and $x_{2i}$ can be stochastically dependent for the same $i$, i.e. inside each observation. 

This is a good example of "transactional costs" -and of the small "menu costs" as Mankiw has once called them. His paper Mankiw (1985) "Small Menu Costs and Large Business Cycles: A Macroeconomic Model of Monopoly" The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 100(2):529-537 contains a model where in his own words, shows that "sticky prices can be both privately efficient and socially inefficient." The basic mechanism of the model is as follows: a monopolistic firm has to set the selling price one period in advance, based on expectations about future demand. If demand is realized lower than expected, the firm can reduce its price but at a "menu cost" (alluding to the costs that restaurants have to bear in order to re-print their catalogs with new prices). Mankiw shows that even though this cost may be small, still it may prevent the firm from adjusting the price. So prices become sticky, which is socially inefficient. Of course this is an underlying theory that justifies the existence of inefficiency due to such "transactional costs". Actually measuring and estimating them would require a detailed audit approach as regards the time spent and other costs involved to change measurement units. 

The OP correctly identified a mistake here. Since the author claims monotonicity for a general function, let's disprove it for the simple linear case. Consider $$x_{t+1} = g(x_t) = -0.5x_t$$ This satisfies all the requirements and conditions stated by the author, and also that the derivative is smaller than unity in absolute values $\forall x$. But it converges with "damped oscillations", and so it is not monotonic since, say, $$x_0 = -3 < 0 = x^*$$ $$x_1 = 1.5$$ $$x_2 = -0.75$$ etc 

In the benchmark hedonic price analysis, we assume a utility function of the general form $$U = U(x, z_1,...,z_n)$$ where "$x$" stands for the composite good, and $(z_1,...,z_n)$ are the characteristics of good $y$ that are valued by the consumer. Assume for simplicity (as is usually done in the literature, and as is the OP case), that the consumer will only purchase just one unit of good $y$ (one house). The budget constraint in this case is $$x+p(z_1,...,z_n) = M$$ where $M$ is the available income and $p(z_1,...,z_n)$ is the price of the good, expressed as a function of those same characteristics. This is an important departure from the standard consumer theory, because here, $p$ is not market price, but it is the "willingness to pay" of the consumer, decomposed into a function of many characteristics. The lagrangean here is $$\Lambda = U(x, z_1,...,z_n) + \lambda[M-x-p(z_1,...,z_n)]$$ and the f.o.c's are $$\partial U / \partial x = \lambda$$ $$\partial U / \partial z_i = \lambda \partial p / \partial z_i, \;\;\; \forall i$$ So $$\partial p / \partial z_i = \frac {\partial U / \partial z_i}{\partial U / \partial x}$$ Note that we have differentiated the price also, since again, this is not "the market price faced by the consumer" but his/her willingness-to-pay. The hedonic-price econometric estimation is based on actual transactions, and so on data related to prices that consumers have actually agreed to pay. So the specification $$p = f(z_1,...,z_n, e)$$ estimates $$\partial p / \partial z_i$$ (and/or their binary-characteristic analogues), which is seen to be the ratio of the marginal utility of the characteristic scaled by the marginal utility of income. If one assumes quasi-linear preferences of the form $$U = v( z_1,...,z_n) +x$$ then $\lambda =1$ and so the marginal utility of the characteristic is the same as the marginal monetary willingness-to-pay for that characteristic. On the basis of these remarks, I think you can conclude whether the econometric specification is a "reduced form" or not. 

The legend says: "the effect on output is nil if the economy starts at long-run equilibrium". But reading the text below the figure, the main argument here appears to be not the fact that we are at long-run equilibrium (and so at full employment, and so producing at maximum capacity), but that the expansion being permanent and not temporary, it has a direct effect on the assets markets (through exchange rate expectations), that offsets the "tendency" to increase output. But tendency or no tendency we cannot produce more output in the short-run, because the authors, in p. 456, when they start discussing effects of permanent changes, they explicitly assume indeed that "the economy starts out at full employment". But the authors comment (in the figure but also in the text below), that if there was no effects on expectations, the economy would have moved to a higher output level. This is inconsistent with the assumption of being at full-employment (of all factors of production). So in the specific set up, the argument about exchange rate expectations is redundant, and the argument about increasing output if that effect was absent, is wrong, given the assumptions. Note that the word "output" is consistently used, which directly links to production, and not the word income which could perhaps accommodate international distributional changes, or the running down of possibly existent inventories. This is obviously a problematic exposition. 

Ignoring the expectations operator, your lagrangean has two mistakes: first the constraint is per-period so it is also multiplied by the discount factor. Second, the way you have wrote the time indexes is inconsistent, as regards their interpretation for capital and bonds. If $K_t$ denotes "capital at the beginning of period $t$" (as it does), you should also write $B_{t}$ instead of $B_{t-1}$, to denote bonds held at the beginning of period $t$. This takes with it also the time index on $Q$. Also I would advise to write your constraint in "normal form" (as they say in micro), namely with the constraint as "higher than or equal to zero". Let's try this, up to a point. $$\Lambda = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^t \Big[U(C_t,L_t) + \lambda_t\big(W_tL_t+R_tK_t+B_{t}+D_t - (P_tC_t + Q_{t+1}B_{t+1}+ P_tI_t)\big)\Big]$$ $$ = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^t \Big[U(C_t,L_t)\\ + \lambda_t\big(W_tL_t+R_tK_t+B_{t}+D_t - P_tC_t - Q_{t+1}B_{t+1}- P_t\big[K_{t+1} - (1-\delta)K_t\big]\big)\Big]$$ Then $$\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial K_{t+1}} = 0 \implies -\beta^{t}\lambda_t P_t + \beta^{t+1}\lambda_{t+1}[(1-\delta)P_{t+1} +R_{t+1}] =0$$ and $$\frac{\partial \Lambda}{\partial B_{t+1}} = 0 \implies -\beta^{t}\lambda_t Q_{t+1} + \beta^{t+1}\lambda_{t+1} =0$$ Equating we get $$\frac {[(1-\delta)P_{t+1} +R_{t+1}]}{P_t} = \frac 1{Q_{t+1}}$$ Now, $R_{t+1}$ is the nominal gross return to capital, so a $P_{t+1}$ is implicitly in there. If we set $r_{t+1}\equiv R_{t+1}/P_{t+1}$ the relation becomes $$\frac {[(1+(r_{t+1} -\delta)]P_{t+1}}{P_t} = \frac 1{Q_{t+1}}$$ Taking logs, we get the Fisher equation written for period $t+1$. 

I leave for another thread the issue "What is the justification of using the arithmetic operation of multiplication and so the product of two variables in order to model the concept of interaction?" Practically, product-terms come from the tradition of the Translog regression specification, which is a second-order approximation to any actual specification, and produces such products. They are therefore considered "second-order" effects, meaning that they are included in a specification alongside the stand-alone variables. This means that their importance is judged after the effect of the stand-alone variables has been taken into account. I have not seen in the literature a situation where "interaction terms" are included alone, without the stand-alone presence of the two variables forming the product. So for the specific study mentioned by the OP, conventional practice would ask "why not include also interaction terms?" Nevertheless, it appears intriguing to argue convincingly that in a certain case, we should only include the "interaction term" of two variables. 

Note that no assumption of identical suppliers is made here, or any other restrictive assumption about technology or the production set. The crucial assumption is the "price-taking" behavior assumed for all firms. Or, "no-market-power". Or, "all firms are equal": doesn't Perfect Competition sound a lot like the market version of Communism (not Socialism)? P.S.: Externalities could also create issues here, of course. 

You work in discrete time, see for example this resource. Or this (incomplete) paper, where the same author participates. In the beginning the paper talks about "coarse discrete methods" and may give the impression that it contains some continuous time simulation method. It really doesn't -see the description of their algorithm in the Appendix, page 30. Also this MPhil dissertation, which, being a graduate thesis, describes the steps in some detail, and with a wealth of referenced literature.
