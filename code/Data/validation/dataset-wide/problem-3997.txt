The most basic difficulty is that there is non a map $R \rightarrow {\mathbb T}$ in general (i.e. one typically doesn't know how to create Galois representations attached to automorphic forms). The second difficulty is that in the TWK method, one must argue with auxiliary primes (the primes typically labelled $Q$), and show that as you add these primes, ${\mathbb T}$ grows in a reasonable way (basically, is free over $\mathcal O[\Delta_Q],$ where $\Delta_Q$ is something like the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $({\mathbb Z}/Q{\mathbb Z})^{\times}.)$ One shows this (or some variant of it) by considering the analogous queston about cohomology of the arithmetic quotients. Suppose for a moment we are in the Shimura variety context, or perhaps the compact at infinity context. Then it will be the middle dimensional cohomology that is of interest, and if we localize at a non-Eisenstein maximal ideal we might hope to kill all other cohomology. Then we can replace a comuptation of middle dimensional cohomology by an Euler characteristic computation, and its easy to see that the Euler char. will multiply by $|\Delta_Q|$ when we add the auxiliary primes $Q$. But in more general contexts, there won't be a single middle dimension in which the maximal ideal of interest is supported (even if it is non-Eisenstein), and computing Euler characteristics will just give $0$, which is not much use. It's not clear that it's even true that adding the auxiliary primes forces the approriate growth of cohomology, and possible torsion in the cohomology just adds to the complication. There is much current work, by various groups of researchers, with various different approaches, aimed at breaking this barrier. 

There is a discussion of the behaviour of $\Pi(\rho_S)$ in Colmez's Asterisque paper which says that the answer is essentially yes. (Probably it deals with the case of a formal family rather than a rigid analytic one, though.) See also the discussion in section 3 of my paper on local-global compatibility, which presents the deformation-theoretic formulation of $p$-adic local Langlands as originally suggested by Kisin. (Again, this will handle formal families rather than rigid ones.) 

Often (perhaps even typically?) in the ind-projective case, people restrict attention to sheaves whose support is finite-dimensional, i.e. if the ind-projective scheme is the limit of the projective schemes $X_n$ under closed immersions, then they consider sheaves which live on one of the $X_n$ (which can then be thought of living on $X_{n'}$ for all higher $n'$ via pushforward). For such sheaves, one may be able to reduce things to Serre's desription, applied to $X_n$. (The complication being that $n$ is not uniquely determined, i.e. can be replaced by $n'$ for any $n' \geq n$.) Sorry if this doesn't tell you anything that you didn't already know! 

Here are two answers: (a) If you try to write down an elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + a x + b$ with everywhere good reduction, you need to choose $a$ and $b$ such that $4a^3 + 27 b^2 = $ a unit. We can certainly solve this equation over some (lots!) of number fields, say if we set the unit equal to $1$ or $-1$, or a unit in some fixed base number field. But we can't solve it in ${\mathbb Q}$. [Edit: As Bjorn intimates in his comment below, one has to be a little more careful than I am being here to be sure of good reduction mod primes above 2; the details are left to the interested reader (or, I imagine, can be found in Silverman in the section where he discusses the proof that there are no good reduction elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q$).] (b) There are many non-trivial everywhere unramified extensions of number fields (e.g. $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-5}, i)$ over $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-5})$), but there are no everywhere unramified extensions of the particular number field $\mathbb Q$. The situation with elliptic curves is completely analogous. 

The Hilbert scheme of a projective variety $X$ over a field $k$ is itself a disjoint union of projective schemes, and hence also a union of irreducible components. A component of the Hilbert scheme is one of these irreducible components (or perhaps, in some contexts, a connected component). The Hilbert polynomial of the closed subschemes $T$ parameterized by a given connected component are constant, and so people may also sometimes speak of ``the component'' of the Hilbert scheme parameterizing subschemes $T$ having a fixed Hilbert polynomial. But (as far as I know) this may not be a single connected component, but could be a union of such. Edit: As Georges explains in his answer, when $X$ is projective space itself, the part of the Hilbert scheme parameterizing subschemes with a fixed Hilbert polynomial is indeed connected (as was proved by Hartshorne). 

Dear Laie, If the $f_i$ correspond to the motives $M_{f_i}$, then $L(f_1\otimes f_2,s)$ is the $L$-function of the product $M_{f_1}\times M_{f_2}$. (If you like, this is an interpretation of the Kunneth formula in cohomology.) 

Dear Dick, I am going to interpret rational points to mean points over $\mathbb Q$. Given this, Mazur's Eisenstein ideal paper, his rational isogenies paper, and various surveys he wrote around that time (mid-to-late 1970s) give a good description (and also prove the most of the key results). Ogg also wrote surveys in the early 70s, making conjectures which Mazur then proved, which are very helpful. You'll easily find them on mathscinet (as you will with Mazur's papers and surveys). Best wishes, Matt 

I think this conjecture is normally attributed to Bloch and Beilinson, and it is a special case of their general conjecture that Albanese equivalence coincides with rational equivalence (up to torsion) on smooth projective varieties over number fields. (For varieties over any field --- of char. zero say --- the Chow groups are expected to have a filtration, whose first steps are homological equivalence, then albanese equivalence. The higher steps in the filtration are conjecturally related to how the two basic conditions --- homological or Albanese triviality --- interact with specialization of the variety. Since a variety over a number field can't be specialized, the filtration should stop after Albanese equivalence, hence the conjecture.) As far as I know there is no literature on this question to speak of, and it is wide open. (I would love to hear something to the contrary!) There is literature on the conjectural filtration on Chow groups --- look in the motives volumes, at some of the papers of Green and Girffiths on arithmetic Hodge structures, and at some of Morihiko Saito's papers. (In both cases, the papers --- at least the ones I remember --- are from around ten years ago. I think there might be '98 ICM talk, for example.) 

You already have two helpful answers related to general aspects of Eichler--Shimura isomorphisms in a $p$-adic context. Here is an answer that more directly addresses your original question. 

One of the most important contemporary mathematical concepts without a rigorous definition is quantum field theory (and related concepts, such as Feynman path integrals). Note: As noted in the comments below, there is a branch of pure mathematics --- constructive field theory --- devoted to making rigorous sense of this problem via analytic methods. I should add that there is also a lot of research devoted to understanding various aspects of field theory via (higher) categorical points of view. But (as far as I understand), there remain important and interesting computations that physicists can make using quantum field theoretic methods which can't yet be put on a rigorous mathematical basis. 

In what sense? If you mean "come from the reduction of $\rho_f$ for some Hecke eigenform $f$'', no, they are not. If you mean "come from the reduction of $\rho$ where $\rho:G_{\mathbb Q} \to GL_2(\mathbb T)$ is the Galois rep'n attached to the Hecke algebra $\mathbb T$ acting on modular forms of some sufficiently large level, then the answer is known to be yes in most cases (i.e. with comparitively minor technical restrictions on $\rho$). This is the content of so-called big $R = $ big $\mathbb T$ theorems, due to Gouvea--Mazur, Boeckle, and others (combined with Serre's conjecture to know that $\overline{\rho}$ is modular). 

Let $0 \to A \to B \to C \to 0$ be a short exact sequence of $R$-modules, with $R$ Noetherian and $C$ of finite type, giving rise to a class $c \in Ext^1_R(C,A)$. Tensoring with $R_{\mathfrak m}$ for a maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$ gives the short exact sequence $0 \to A_{\mathfrak m} \to B_{\mathfrak m} \to C_{\mathfrak m} \to 0$, which corresponds to the image of $c$ in the $Ext^1_{R_{\mathfrak m}}(C_{\mathfrak m},A_{\mathfrak m}) = R_{\mathfrak m}\otimes_R Ext^1_R(C,A)$. (This isomorphism holds because $R_{\mathfrak m}$ is flat over $R$; to prove it one computes the Ext via a resolution of $C$ by finite rank free $R$-modules, which exists since $R$ is Noetherian and $C$ is of finite type.) Now suppose that these localizations are all split. Then we have an element $c$ in the $R$-module $Ext^1_R(C,A)$ whose image in the localization at each maximal ideal $\mathfrak m$ vanishes. It follows that this element itself vanishes. (Its annihilator is not contained in any maximal ideal.) So the answer seems to be "yes": for Noetherian $R$, if a short exact sequence whose third term is finite type splits locally at every $\mathfrak m$, it splits. Note: I think one can also see this by comparing sheaf Exts with actual Exts for the associated quasi-coherent sheaves on Spec $R$. The point is that there is a spectral sequence involving the cohohomology of the sheaf Exts converging to the actual Exts (in some generality), but on the affine Spec $R$ the higher cohomology of the sheaf Exts vanishes, so that a class in any $Ext^i$ is a global section of the sheaf Ext, and hence is determined by what happens locally. (Hopefully this is not all nonsense.) 

At least in the contexts that I am familiar with, a family $X \to S$ with $S$ a smooth curve is called semistable at a closed point $s$ if it has a local model (local in the analytic topology if we are working over $\mathbb C$, or local in the etale topology in general) of the form Spec $k[X_1,\ldots,X_n,t]/(X_1\ldots X_m -t)$ for some $m \leq n,$ where $t$ is a uniformizing paramater of the curves $S$ at $s$. Note that such a local model is regular, and so if $X$ is semistable at every point of $S$ then it is smooth. I believe that semistability in this sense can also be characterized as follows: (i) $X$ is regular; (ii) the fibres of $X$ over points of $S$ are reduced normal crossings divisors. This is presumably why it is required that $X$ is smooth in your context; if $X$ were not smooth, and $Y$ was a "semistable reduction" for $X$ which didn't resolve the singularities of $X$, then $Y$ could not actually be semistable in the usual sense. A good example to think about, in the context of a family of curves, is a singularity of the following kind: Spec $k[x,y,t]/(x y = t^{n+1})$. This has a reduced normal crossings divisor over $t = 0$, but is not regular if $n > 0$. It is easy to resolve the singularity, though: just repeatedly blow-up the singular point. After you do this $n$ times, you will resolve the singularity, and you will get a reduced normal crossings divisor with $n + 2$ components: the original two components, plus $n$ components (each a $\mathbb P^1$) obtained from the blow-ups. [Added to answer a question in the comments: If $X$ is singular, say with isolated singularities, with all the singular points lying in the singular fibres, then when we resolve the singularities of $X$, $X$ does not change in the complement of its singular points, and the singular points get replaced by various exceptional divisors. So no singular fibres will be added, but the component structure of the singular fibres will be changed.] 

Here's a first pass at your question; hopefully it will suggest something more definitive. Let's imagine we were in the simplest case, where $X$ is a disk, with its smooth model being the formal affine line over $R$, and that $Z$ was the sub-disk of elements of absolute value less than or equal the absolute value of the uniformizer. Then we can find a semistable model in which $Z$ is one of the covering opens, by blowing up the formal affine line at the origin. So in this test case, the answer seems to be yes . Now in general, I think that Raynaud (and/or his collaborators or those who followed in his tradition) will say that the open immersion $Z \rightarrow X$ extends to an open immersion of formal models. So we can blow up the smooth model of $X$ and the smooth model of $Z$ so that the latter sits inside the former. What I'm not very certain about is how much you can control the nature of these blow-ups. (Presumably not at all in general, but you're starting in a fairly nice situation.) Have you tried asking Brian Conrad yet? 

Just to be clear: "normal" for a ring (assumed Noetherian to be safe) means (essentially by definition) that it is is a product of normal domains. Here is one justification for this: suppose that a reduced ring $A$ is integrally closed in its total quotient ring (i.e. in the localization of $A$ with respect to its non-zero divisors). If $K(A)$ denotes this total quotient ring, then $K(A) = \prod K_i$ is a product of field $K_i$. Let $e_i$ denote the element of $K(A)$ which is $1$ in the $i$th place and $0$ everywhere else. Then $e_i^2 = e_i = 0$, thus $e_i$ is integral over $A$, thus $e_i \in A$ by the assumption, and so $A$ has a decomposition $A = \prod A_i$ into a product of domains corresponding to the decomposition of $K(A)$ into a product of fields. In particular, if Spec $A$ is connected, then $A$ is itself a domain, and so Spec $A$ is in fact irreducible. (This fact about normal rings is one of the basic motivations for their application in geometry: normalization is a process for resolving singularities that are caused by differenet irreducible components crossing, because it resolves different irreducible components into different connected components.) 

If I'm not mistaken, the map $Res^0$ is a bijection. Indeed, restriction induces maps $$Hom_X(\mathcal A,\mathcal B) \to Hom_X(\mathcal A^0,\mathcal B^0)\to Hom_K(A,B).$$ The composite is a bijection, by the universal mapping property of Neron models, and both maps are injective, since $A$ is Zariski dense in $\mathcal A^0$, which in turn is Zariksi dense in $\mathcal A$. Thus both maps are bijections, and hence $Res^0$ is a bijection. 

In response to Minhyong's request, I am reposting my comments above as an answer: As James Newton commented, if $L/K$ is unramified, then an irreducible $n$-dimensional representation (over $\mathbb C$) of $Gal(L/K)$ will correspond, in the Langlands paradise, to a cuspidal automorphic representation of $GL_n(\mathbb A_K)$. The cuspidal automorphic representations that arise in this way are sometime (especially in the older literature) called "Galois type". Thus one can (more or less --- there is the issue of irreducible vs. all reps. which I won't think about here) encode unramified extensions of $K$ whose Galois groups admit $n$-dimensional representations in terms of Galois type cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ of $GL_n(\mathbb A_K)$ that are unramified at every finite prime. Now the question arises: how many such $\pi$ are there, and can one compute them? Being of Galois type is (conjecturally, but we are in paradise!) purely a condition on $\pi_v$ for primes $v$ of $K$ lying over $\infty$, and in fact there are a finite number of prescribed representations of $GL_n(K_v)$ ($= GL_n(\mathbb R)$ or $GL_n(\mathbb C)$) which are allowed. (E.g. for $GL_n(K)$, the possibilities are limit of discrete series, corresponding to holomorphic weight one forms, or principal series with $\lambda = 1/4$, corresponding to Maass forms with eigenvalue of Laplacian equal to $1/4$.) For a given $n$ and $K$, these can be enumerated. Now since we are asking that the "weight" (i.e. the collection of $\pi_v$ for $v|\infty$) be bounded (i.e. lie in a given finite set), and we are also asking that "level" be one (i.e. that there is no ramification at any finite prime), there are only a finite set of $\pi$ corresponding to irreducible everywhere unramified $n$-dimensional complex representations of $GL_n(Gal(\bar{K}/K)$. [Aside: Minhyong asked for a sketch of a proof of this; here goes: fixing the representation at infinity means that we are fixing a bunch of elliptic operators that the automorphic forms must satisfy. Fixing the level means that we are working on some particular quotient $X/\Gamma$ (here $X$ is the symmetric space attached to the real group in question, in our particular case $GL_n(K\otimes \mathbb R)$, and $\Gamma$ is the fixed level). This need not be compact (indeed won't be in our particular case), but the cuspidal condition (indeed, even the moderate growth condition that non-cuspidal automorphic forms are required to satisfy) means that we can pretend it is, since we explicitly rule out the possibility of extreme growth at infinity. So now we looking at sections of some bundle on a compact space satsifying a bunch of elliptic equations, and such a space of sections if finite dimensional. (The holomorphic modular forms case is the most familiar: in this case the elliptic equations are the Cauchy--Riemann equations. In the Maass form case, the corresponding fact is the finiteness of the eigenspaces of the Laplacian. These are good models for the general case.)] To actually compute them (say for a fixed choice of $K$ and $n$) would be quite difficult (as David Hansen notes in his comment). The reason is that the relevant $\pi_v$ for $v|\infty$ are never discrete series (even when $n = 2$, and in any case, note that $GL_n(\mathbb R)$ never has discrete series if $n > 2$, and $GL_n(\mathbb C)$ never has discrete series when $n > 1$), and so standard applications of the trace formula to counting automorphic forms won't work. Nevertheless, it seems that one might still be able to use the trace formula to analyze the situation, at least in principle. For example, Selberg used his original formulation of the trace formula for $SL_2(\mathbb R)/SL_2(\mathbb Z)$ to compute cuspidal Maass forms of level 1, and showed that the smallest eigenvalue $\lambda$ that occurs has $\lambda$ much greater than 1/4 (maybe closer to 90?). And we all know that it is not hard to show that there are no holomorphic weight one forms of level one. So one can automorphically prove (modulo standard conjectures in the Maass form case) that there are no everywhere unramified two-dimensional complex representations of $Gal(\bar{\mathbb Q}/\mathbb Q)$. (This is of course an incredible battle, even in paradise, for a tiny portion of the information that Minkowski gives us, but is meant just to illustrate that this approach is not a priori ridiculous.) What I don't see at all from this point of view is how to study all $n$ simultaneously. For example, one could imagine implementing this program and finding, for some $K$ and some $n$, maybe $n = 10^6$, that there are no unramified extensions $L/K$ with $L$ admitting an irrep. of dimension $\leq 10^6$. This doesn't rule out the possibility that there is a beautiful, everywhere unramified extension $L/K$ whose Galois group's lowest degree irrep. happens to be of enormous dimension. The Langlands program seems to be intrinsically geared to thinking about linear representations of Galois groups, and to set the scene, you have to begin by choosing a linear group, which will then cut everything else down in a Procrustean manner. At least superficially (and this answer reflects just superficial thoughts about the question), it doesn't seem well adapted to questions related to the nature of $\pi_1(\mathcal O)$, where no a priori linear structure is given, or indeed expected. [Added July 14, in response to Minhyong's question in the comments as to whether or not discrete series can convert into non-discrete series after applying some functoriality. The answer is essentially no, as I will now explain. Added November 29, 2011: What follows is wrong; the answer seems rather to be yes. (See below for details.) For an arithmetic geometer, one should think of an automorphic form on the adelic group $G(\mathbb A_K)$ as a morphism from the motivic Galois group (over the base number field $K$) to the $L$-group of $G$. (There are subtleties and caveats, of course, but they need not concern us here; all I will say about them is that automorphic forms can give rise to "motives" with non-integral $(p,q)$ in its Hodge decomposition, which necessitates enlarging the category of motives to an unknown larger category, whose hypothetical Tannakian group is called "the Langlands group".) Now functoriality takes place when you have a map from the $L$-group of $G$ to the $L$-group of $H$; one can just compose this with a map from the motivic Galois group to the former, to obtain a map from the motivic Galois group to the latter. Functoriality is the assertion that the corresponding automorphic form on $H(\mathbb A_K)$ exists. Now given an automorphic form $\pi$, its factors at the primes $v|\infty$ encode (via the local Langlands corresondence for $\mathbb R$ or $\mathbb C$) the Hodge numbers of the corresponding motive. One feature of discrete series is that (among other properties) they give rise to regular Hodge numbers, i.e. to sequences of $h^{p,q}$ with each $h^{p,q} \leq 1$. Now our original automorphic rep'n $\pi$ on $G(\mathbb A)$ corresponds to a motive whose Mumford--Tate group lies in the $L$-group of $G$, and if $\pi$ has discrete series components at primes above $\infty$, it has regular Hodge numbers at every place dividing $\infty$. If we then pass to a new motive by applying some map from the $L$-group of $G$ to the $L$-group of $H$, then concretely this corresponds to doing some kind of multilinear algebra on our motive, and the only way this can kill the property of having regular Hodge--Tate weights is if we do something like taking the diagonal map from the $L$-group of $G$ into its product with itself, and then embed the latter into the $L$-group of $H$. All such constructions will necessarily be a "reducible" rep'n of the $L$-group of $G$ in the $L$-group of $H$ (more precisely, the centralizer will be a non-trivial Levi), and the corresponding automorphic form won't be a cuspform. But even if we destroy the property of having regular Hodge numbers, we typically still don't have an Artin motive. To get an Artin motive we have to have $h^{p,q} = 0$ unless $p = q = 0$, and to do this, we have to do even more destructive things, like map the $L$-group of $G$ into the $L$-group of $H$ via the trivial representation, or something similar. Again, this won't correspond to any kind of interesting automorphic forms, just those that correspond to (certain) sums of characters. So we can't produce interesting Galois type automorphic forms out of automorphic forms whose factors at primes above $\infty$ are discrete series.] [Correction added Nov. 29, 2011: From the Galois/motivic point of view, we have an algebraic group (the Mumford--Tate group of some motive), with a representation (the particular motive), and the Mumford--Tate group contains a cocharacter whose eigenvalues are the Hodge numbers. Discrete series corresponds to the eigenspaces being one dimensional. We now apply some functoriality, which is essentially to say that we apply some multi-linear algebraic process to the representation. Now this can certainly produce eigenspaces for the cocharacter of multiplicity $> 1$. (E.g. the adjoint representation of $SL_3$ has a two-dimensional eigenspace.) So it seems that functoriality doesn't preserve being discrete series. It does preserve being tempered. And the remarks about not getting Artin motives still seem okay, since while the eigenspaces can become greater than $1$-dimensional, for all the eigenspaces to become trivial, we have to do something pretty destructive, like applying functoriality for the trivial representation.]
