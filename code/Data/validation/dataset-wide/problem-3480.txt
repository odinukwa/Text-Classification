Different elements can contribute to such an evolution, without trying to be exhaustive, these are a few general comments: 

Given a hamiltonian of the form: \begin{equation} H_{t} = ln(c_{t}) \dot{} e ^{-\rho t} + \lambda_{t}(w+ra_{t}-c_{t}), \end{equation} with $c_{t}$ consumption at time t (the control variable), $\rho > 0$ time preference, $w$ a constant (for example wage), $a$ assets held in period t (this is the state variable for which the dynamics are described by: $\frac{da_{t}}{dt}=\dot{a_{t}}= w+ra_{t}-c_{t})$ and $r$ the return on assets. The first order conditions are: $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial c_{t}}=0$ $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}=-\dot{\lambda_{t}}$, or equivalently, $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}+\dot{\lambda_{t}}=0$. We were taught that $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}$ can be interpreted as the marginal return on assets in t, and $\dot{\lambda}$ as a capital gain. Together they are the overal return. An accompanying sketch with $a_{t}$ on the horizontal and $H_{t}$ on the vertical axis shows $H_{t}$ is a concave function with a maximum. The growthpath for consumption is given by $\frac{\dot{c_{t}}}{c_{t}}=-\frac{\dot{\lambda_{t}}}{\lambda_{t}}-\rho$, so that consumption grows over time if $\rho+\frac{\dot{\lambda_{t}}}{\lambda_{t}}<0$, that is: consumption grows if the relative capital losses exceed time preference. As such, the optimizing agent should let his consumption grow when there are sufficiently big capital losses. My questions are the following: 

Complementary to the answer of Ubiquitous with respect to the effect of a devaluation on foreign trade (and only of marginal importance), is the possibility that the positive effect of a devaluation on the current account occurs only after an initial worsening of the current account. This sequence of a worsening and subsequently improving current account in response to a devaluation is called the J-curve effect, introduced by, if I rembember well, Abba and Lerner. Its presence can be explained by disentangling two opposite effects that result from a devaluation: a volume-effect that positively affects the current account and a price-effect that negatively affects the current account. The volume effect with a positive impact on the current account is exactly what is described by Ubiquitous. The negative impact of the price-effect on the current account follows from the fact that any given imported quantity becomes more expensive after the devaluation. This price-effect will dominate in the case that the price-elasticity of domestic demand for imports and the price-elasticity of foreign demand for domestic exports are low, because in that case the exported quantities will increase only modestly and imports will decrease only modestly. Or, put differently, in this case of low price-elasticities, de volume effect is small. This is typically the case in the short run. In the long run the volume-effect can be expected to dominate. 

I am quite surprised that none of the answers above have mentioned the classic Barro article "Are Government Bonds Net Wealth" The way I understand it is that given that the utility function is increasing and concave in consumption, increasing consumption increases utility but at a decreasing rate. Using the same logic, decreasing consumption decreases utility at an increasing rate! So, you can think of this in a representative consumer's framework- the marginal costs of increasing taxation are increasing. If the government wants to expend money for a certain project- building a damn for instance- many fixed costs have to be borne immediately. In order to not tax the public all at once, they smooth out taxation- providing the service while at the same time not making the consumer pay all at once. There is a side of the argument that the governments have a comparative advantage in providing loans compared to, for ex, banks. So, in effect, they take out a loan in the name of the public at lower interest rates. 

Yes, there is an income effect, as the individual needs to work less in order to obtain the same amount in the numerator (relative to before the increase in exchange rate). The assumption is that the substitution effect dominates the income effect here, regardless of whether the individual is a borrower or a lender. 

It has nothing to do with new products in the market, nor with confusion of use-value and exchange-value. To make it a bit simpler: 1) Commodities in capitalism have a two-fold character. The use-value (they are useful products for the buyer to consume) and the exchange-value (they can be exchanged to another products in a given way). 2) The exchange-value of the product depends on the embodied labor of the product, which is named as Value by Marx. So in a sense, exchange-value = Value. 3) Products can only be compared in relation to one another. You cannot understand anything by saying ex. 2 apples = 2 apples. Thus, we reach to the Elementary Form: 20 yards of linen = 1 coat In this equation, linen plays the active role or Relative form and coat plays the passive role, or Equivalent form. In other terms, you define the Value of linen comparing it to the Value of coat. Now, here is the core of the analysis. Marx claims that since there is a comparison (20 linen=1 coat), there must be a common element to compare. That common element is not the use-value (linen is not the same as coat). It is the exchange-value, or Value, or the human labor embodied in the two products. In other words, this equation states that labor needed to develop 20 yards of linen is equal to labor needed to develop 1 coat (given constant technological advancement, resources, etc.) Use-value, on the other hand, just acts as a carrier of Value. The importance of this realization, is to understand the essence of exchange in capitalistic world and connect it to the money form (20 yards of linen = 1 coat = 100 Euros), and understand socio-economically how money was created and what does it really mean.

I have always thought that variation in regressors are a good thing. In fact, one can show that the precision of the estimated coefficients is increasing in the variance of the regessors. I have also heard that simple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are very good to gauge causal effects. Consider the following regression:$$ Y_{i}=\alpha+\beta X_{i}+\epsilon_{i} $$ where $X_{i}$ is a dummy variable that takes on the value 1 if the individaul $i$ is treated and 0 otherwise. My question is as follows: in this setting, $var(X)=p(1-p)$, This value takes on a maximum at 0.25. I do not think this variance is that 'large.' Can someone please clarify if this is indeed then a shortcoming? Given that we do not observe that much variation at all, how are we able to gauge so much ? Is it because the variation is random? Thanks! 

To add to some of the answers above, there is another subtle point one must bear in mind. Inequality is a relative concept, not an absolute one. Growing inequality by itself does not bear any consequences on absolute levels of wealth. For instance, think about the ratio of the 90-10 quantile of income for the past few years. If this ratio has been growing, all this means is that the 90th quantile of income is growing faster than the 10th quantile of income. Both could be growing, and one could be growing faster than the other. I suggest you check out the study by Dollar and Kraay (2002) "Growth is good for the Poor." 

The prevailing explanation for the existence of rate of interest (aka time-value of money) is the one thoroughly explained above by Alecos. My objection to this is that it analyses the phenomenon from a psychological perceptive, and not from a purely economical one. I will give Marx's arguments on the matter, as an alternative for you to consider. According to Marx, there is no such thing as "Natural Interest". There is nothing natural in it. The rate of interest is just an agreement made between money capitalists on one side (banks) and the industrial and commercial capitalists on the other (factory owners, merchants, etc.) and it varies depending on the competition between them. The theory behind this explanation, lies on Marx's central idea that profit is not made during product exchange, but during the production, by extracting the surplus value from the workers. So, how does a banker makes a profit? What is really happens, in simple words, is firstly he lends capital to the factory owner/merchant, then profit is produced via the production process and in the end profit is shared between the two. Thus, competition between the two different types of capitalists (relation between real capital/money in an society at a given time period), determines the rate of interest. Given these arguments, the answer to your question is that in a capitalistic society, there is indeed time-value of money, as there has to be rate of interest (credit system will always be essential for such a society to exist). However, in a non-capitalistic society, ex. in a socialist one, there can be banks to serve public needs, public sector projects & state-owned enterprises, but there won't be a rate of interest for that, thus the time-value of money disappears in such a society.

The total wealth (as is pointed out in the book) is given as : $$ X(1)=\delta_{0}B(1)+\delta_{1}S_{1}(1)+...\delta_{N}S_{N}(1) $$ The wealth at period one is just the sum of the securities (including amount invested in the bank) times their number. In other words, the total wealth is the amount of money this individual has invested in the different assets. It has nothing to do with a "changing process." Asssume that the individual does not buy any more assets during period 1 and the assets promise a return of $(1+r_{i})$ where $i$ denotes the asset in question. In period 2, the individuals wealth is then $$ X(2)=\delta_{0}B(1)(1+r_{0})+\delta_{1}S_{1}(1)(1+r_{1})+...\delta_{N}S_{N}(1)(1+r_{N}) $$ 

A lot of macro nowadays (at least for the past couple of decades) is based on DSGE models. These models recognize the dynamic nature of agents' decisions. A standard approach to solving such problems relies on dynamic programming. My personal favorite to understand dynamic programming and its applications can be found in the Sargent and Ljungqvist booK: $URL$ 

No, savings is a structural parameter in the Solow model and is not affected by income level. The basic differential equation of the Solow model is given by $$ \dot{k}=sk^{\alpha}-(\delta+n+g)k $$ In steady state, as you pointed out, both output and capital only depend on the structural parameters. What would happen is that the output would shoot beyond its steady state level till the time the reparations are being paid, and then go back to the original level. Logically you are right- The marginal propensity to save increases in income. However, in no way is this implied by the Solow model. 

No, cointegration occurs when two series have the same stochastic trend. In order to have a stochastic trend, they should be nonstationary. Stationary variables do not have a trend. You can perform standard inference. 

A flat AD-curve is not the result of the desire of a central bank to stabilize the price level, it is determined by the behaviour of the aggreggate economy (such as elasticities and taxes). Stabilizing the price level by using monetary or fiscal policy can be done by shifting the AD-curve (or influencing the slope of the curve, but that is a less standard option). In this context the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy depends on how easily policymakers can shift the AD-curve. If you have an equation for AD, this can be easily calculated as $\frac{\partial Y}{\partial X }$, $X$ being the variable in the AD-equation used to implement the policy. The effectiveness of monetary or fiscal policy also depends on the slope of the AS-curve, possible shifts in the (short run) AS-curve in response to the policy (such as inflation expectations), and the objective of the policy: price stabilization or outputstabilization. 

I believe that tax policies refer to the supply side (AS). Since no information is given about government expenses in a, b and c, I would only shift AD in response to the monetary policy actions in a and c, and the explicit increase in goverment spending in option D. 

EDIT: The time value of money in a capitalist society stems from the fact that a capital now can be invested to yield a larger capital later. Thus, it has a dynamic, a potential and there lies its time value. And that's its connection to the interest rate, as explained above. In a socialist society, that's not the case, as there is no private investment for profit. The "more is better" argument is debatable, as it lies on psychological reasoning. To what extend money for consumption now is better than money for consumption later in any kind of society can vary according to individual's preferences, views, current needs, economic security of a given society, etc. 

Source: Capital Volume II, Chapter 6: The Costs of Circulation, I. Genuine Costs of Circulation, III. Costs of Transportation My understanding of Marx's argument is the following: Transportation does not alter the quantity/quality of products significantly. But, products need to have a use-value in order to also have an exchange value. Thus, an orange for example produced in Spain has an exchange value in UK, only if it arrives in UK, so that it can be bought and consumed. So, transportation adds value to the products, and this is done (as with all products) partly from the labor value (transportation workers) and partly from the means of production (means of transportation: airplanes, ships, cars, trucks...). Since transportation adds value to the product, and since price is a mirror of value according to Marx, then we can say that transportation tends to increase the price of the product (which is a logical assumption on average). Regarding distance, I am not sure if that is explicitly mentioned, but again we can deduce from the previous that: bigger distance --> more transportation needed (given constant technological advancement in a period) --> more transportation labor needed + more transportation means of production --> more added value --> tendency for bigger price. 

I hope this question is not too general in nature; I just wanted to ask the members of this community their opinion on the following question: How can one choose between the Bayesian approach and the Frequentist Approach? In what context is one approach better than the other? The reason I ask this is because whenever I attempt to answer causal empirical questions, I immediately think of trying to estimate Treatment Effects (for instance using difference in means, Difference-in-differences or matching estimators). On the other hand, when I wish to forecast, Ive heard that Bayesian Model Averaging Techniques often outpeform linear projections. On what basis can I choose between the two approaches? Thanks! 

The way I would think of this is as follows. Let us write the value of the first company as $V_{A}$and the second as $V_{B}.$ Given your definition, let me know if you agree with the following argument: $$ V_{A}=s_{AA}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\pi_{tA}+s_{AB}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\pi_{tB} $$ Where $s_{AA}$ denotes the time invariant share of company A that comapny A owns and $s_{BA}$ denotes the share of the company B that A owns. Moreover, $\pi_{t}=A_{t}-L_{t}$ or the equity of each company. By a symmetric argument, we have that : $$ V_{B}=(1-s_{AA})\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\pi_{tA}+(1-s_{AB})\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\pi_{tB} $$ Now, consider company $A.$ Taking differentials: $$ dV_{A}=s_{AA}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}d\pi_{tA}+s_{AB}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}d\pi_{tB} $$ Ceteris Paribus,you claim that $\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}d\pi_{tA}=1$ and the other term equals 0. So what you have then is: $$ dV_{A}=s_{AA}\times1 $$ and $$ dV_{B}=(1-s_{AA})\times1 $$ The answer is fairly intuitive- the change in value of each firm is the change in profits that one of the firms has experienced times the share of the profitable firm owned by either. If each firm owned half, then the change in the value of each firm for an increase in $1 would be half, since each firm would have half the claim on the firm whose profit has increased by a half.
