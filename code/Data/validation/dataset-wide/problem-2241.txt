In the first quarter of the Super Bowl, the Seahawks threw an incomplete pass on first down, leading to second down. Except that the offense had a "false start," for a five yard penalty. The Broncos accepted it, and it was first and 15 instead of second and 10. Why would the Broncos prefer the extra five yards instead of declining the penalty for a loss of a down? My understanding is that fewer opportunities for "conversion" often outweighs the distance. Unless the penalty decision was governed by field position? The Seahawks started from the Broncos 30, and were pulled back to the 35, toward the edge of field goal range. 

Team 1 begins by going to Team 2 and offers X for Y. Team 2 counters by saying, I don't think X is as valuable as Y, so I want X and Z for Y. That would be a "two for one." Team 1 says, I don't want to give you a whole "extra" player, but if you trade me Y for X, which works in my favor, I'll offer you A for B, which works in yours. Now it's "two for two." So if team 2 agrees that the "package" X+A = the Y+B "package" (and both sides get what they want), the deal gets done. Is that how a "multiplayer" dialog might go or are there other routes? (An example was Sean Burnett and Nyger Morgan for Joel Hanrahan and Lastings Milledge between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Nationals some years ago, from my own piece: (I'm not referring to a veterans for prospects trade, that's a separate question.) 

The answer is no, students do not need to be of that faith. What is true about the "religious" colleges is that they are sponsored by churches of that faith. And perhaps "faith" is a "tiebreaker" when choosing between applicants. As a practical matter, good athletes are scarce enough so that "athlete" trumps "faith." But the U.S. government will not provide Federal funding to schools that limit enrollments to one faith. One college, Bob Jones University, tried to impose certain (non-religious) limitations on enrollment, and lost its Federal funding. 

A "rusher" is a running back from the offensive team who runs with, or "rushes" the ball, like you said. But a "pass rusher" is someone from the defensive team who is "rushing" (chasing) the quarterback, who has elected to keep the ball for a (potential) pass. This defender could be a lineman (end), linebacker, or even the "free safety" (from the backfield), who normally double covers the offensive team's best receiver, but was used instead in a "blitz." You appear to have been confused by the similarity of the two terms. 

There are three possibilities that I can see. The first is if less than half of a baseball game (four and a half innings) is played, then the game is canceled and a completely new make up game is scheduled. That, I can follow. My understanding is that if the home team is leading when the game is interrupted during the bottom of the fifth or later, the rest of the game isn't played, and the home team gets the win. There was one instance I remember, when the rain interrupted the Yankees, who were leading 2-1 in the top of the 8th . There was a partial "makeup" on a subsequent day, not of the whole game, but of the remainder of the eighth and ninth innings. Then there's the case of the Pirates at Atlanta tonight, with the visitors leading 3-2 at the end of six. I read that unless the game were continued the same night, a victory would be recorded for the Pirates over the six inning game. If the home team is leading after four and a half, determination of the win seems trivial. But if the visiting team is leading, how would they determine whether the game will be scored as a visitors' win or continued later from the point of interruption? 

In asking this question, I am not referring to exceptional cases like Yovani Gallardo, Madison Bumgarner, or Jake Arrieta, who hit about as well as position players. But I am referring to "most" pitchers, whose batting averages are in the .100s, about half as high as average position players. I read somewhere that there is a theoretical batting average below which it was right to always throw strikes because the chances of getting the person out was so high that it was worthwhile not to give him a chance to walk, and as a practical matter, there was a somewhat higher threshold below which it made sense to throw mostly strikes, thereby giving the batter a minimal chance to walk. My best recollection is that the rule is that one should "never" walk a batter (incurring a sure loss) whose average was below .075 even if he all home runs, and that it made sense to never walk a batter with an average as high as .225 if he never made extra base hits. Don't most National League pitchers fall beneath these thresholds as batters? (Or if I have stated them wrongly, the "corrected" ones?) So why do pitchers often throw enough balls to walk them, when they could get them out by throwing mostly strikes? Put another way, why does practice differ from theory in this instance? 

In tennis, the person with the serve has a clear advantage. This is is certainly true at love-love, where four points are needed to win a game. A server who lets the game go to "deuce" has squandered part of that advantage. From that point, two (consecutive) points are needed to win. What do tournament (or other) statistics have to say about the server's advantage from "deuce" as opposed to from love?" And do the statistics say that the receiver is actually favored to win the set, starting from an "ad" (advantage)? From this point, the receiver need to win only one game, while the server needs (at least) three. 

It was shocking, but a low seeded player ousted Number 2 seeded Li Na in the first (women's) round of the French Open. My understanding is that the seeding is designed to prevent this from happening so early. For instance, in a field of 128, the top seed is matched against the 128th seed in the first round, the number 2 against the 127th, etc. The idea in the first round is to eliminate the bottom 64 players, and most of the "survivors" will be seeded 1-64. Given that Kristina Mladenovic eliminated Li Na, it's unlikely that she's really "only" 127. And she gets Li Na's (number 2) spot for the second round of 64, and is likely to be paired against say, the 63rd seeded player. Would it be a reasonable guess that Mladenovic's true talent level is probably at least 50th to 100th, so that she's probably not an underdog against the number 63rd seed in the second round? Or does history show that these early round eliminations are "flukes" and the "eliminator" gets eliminated soon after? 

BABIP is "batting average on balls in play." This excludes home runs (hence out of the park, not in play), as well as base on balls and strikeouts. For hitters, BABIP is a "base" for constructing batting averages. The average BABIP given up by a pitcher is something like .300. Most batters have averages below .300 because they strike out a lot. That gives them fewer chances to apply that ".300" average to balls in play, while the strikeouts are in the denominator of the batting average. On the other hand, home runs are "free" hits that do not count in the BABIP calculation, but does improve the batting average. The assumption of a .300 BABIP is also critical in computing pitchers' field independent pitching statistics (FIP). The formula is 3.00 +(13*HR+ 3*Walks-2*KO)/IP, with the "constant" 3.00 assuming a .300 BABIP. That is, if a pitcher gave up no home runs and no walks, and struck out no one, his ERA would be 3.00, because there would be about 12 hits (and 27 outs) in a game, yielding three runs (on average). All other things being equal, strikeouts reduce a pitcher's ERA, because there are fewer contacted balls to hit. Walks increase a pitcher's ERA because they are "free bases," as do home runs "free runs," that don't "run the gauntlet" of bat to ball to field. 

(Unlike some of my other recent questions, this one is primarily about baseball.) Most minor leaguers are players just drafted out of high school or college, and working their way up (hopefully) to the majors. But there are some instances, where injured or otherwise "recycled" major league players spend some time in the minors. Just ask Dan Uggla, who recently signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants. How do such minor league deals work? Specifically is this a strategy that a cash rich, prospect poor team such as the Giants (and even more so, the LA Angels, who traded their few good prospects for closer Huston Street) can use to re-build their depth chart? 

Then one I'm thinking of is Giancarlo Stanton, who will have the ability to "opt out"from (or "opt in") to his contract after 2020. Would it be possible (within the rules) for Miami to trade Stanton to another team for X, which is all the Marlins get if he opts out, but the receiving team surrenders a PTBNL (player to be named later) if Stanton opts in after 2020, and plays out the rest of his contract? That would probably come from the receiving team's then farm system, with some restrictions. (My recollection was that e.g. Trea Turner was a PTBNL in a trade, because it was against the rules to trade him within 12 months of drafting/signing him.) 

On the offensive side, there are two basic types of players: 1) linemen, who line up on the line of scrimmage and protect their teammates, and 2) ball handlers. The five linemen consists of the "center" (in the middle of the line) who "hikes" the ball to his quarterback, two "guards" on either side, and two "tackles," who are "wide" protectors. These five linemen are not eligible to receive passes. The six ball handlers include the quarterback, who receives the ball from the center, a big full back, who can run with the ball up the middle, a fast half back who can run with the ball to the sides, and three pass receivers, posted at the end of the line "outside" the tackles. Any of these men can receive a forward pass, and are "eligible receivers." That is, depending on the situation, the quarterback may send his halfback and fullback forward to try to catch passes instead of run with the ball. On the defense side, there are typically four linemen (opposing five offensive linemen), and four men in the back, or "secondary, opposing the three pass receivers. Between these lines are the so-called "line backers," who are floaters that can either reinforce the lineman, if the offense is running with the ball, or the secondary, of the offense is using a pass play. Basically, the idea was to prevent too many offensive players from doing too many different things, thereby making it too hard for the defense to counter them. 

Hideki Matsui, a Japanese player, played for a Japanese baseball team, then the New York Yankees for several years, then several more U.S. teams. On July 28, 2013, he signed a final one day contract with the Yankees, in order to retire as a Yankee. How, if at all, did that affect the Yankees' 40 man roster? 1) Did they pick a day when they had only 39 men because of injuries or other reasons, making Matsui the 40th for one day? 2) Is there a "window" of say, 24 hours whereby the Yankees could temporarily have 41 men, as long as Matsui leaves within that window? 3) Or did the Yankees actually have to make a roster move to accommodate Matsui. 

The pitcher who is responsible for putting the men on base is the one that the runs are charged against. In this case, the two men on base at the time the reliever came on are charged to the original pitcher, A. Runs for men put on base by pitcher B are charged to him. It pitcher B came in while his team is leading by say, one run, and the reliever gives up a hit that scores one or two runs, he is charged with a blown save. If giving up the second run results in a loss (with no further runs scored in the game), the loss is charged to pitcher A, 

I don't exactly when such things became more common, but I have the sense that they are more common than in the 1970s, when I was growing up. That's because baseball management has become more "scientific" in the past 40 years, with the monitoring of things like pitch counts for pitchers, innings counts for fielders, left-right and right-left batter-pitcher match-ups, and even "splits" of individual batters versus individual pitchers. 

A rushing yard is a "running yard" gained on an official "rushing" play. This occurs when the quarterback either runs the ball himself (without passing), or hands the ball to a halfback or fullback for "rushing." There are running yards that are NOT counted as rushing yards on other, non rushing plays. For instance, suppose a quarterback completes a pass for 20 yards, and the receiver runs another 15 yards. Those are 15 "running yards" that are not rushing yards; it counts as a 35-yard pass. Suppose a defender intercepts a pass and runs it back 10 yards. Those are 10 running yards that are not rushing yards. And a 25 yard kickoff or punt return are running yards but not rushing yards. 

In finance, it's called the time value of money. That is, $1 million paid in 2020 doesn't cost quite as much as $1 million paid in 2013 because the team can earn interest on the money. In "selling" contracts to their players, teams dangle the largest total number of dollars. Then they try to compensate by pushing back those dollars in time with players that don't understand the above paragraph. A really smart player might settle for fewer dollars paid earlier, but few players would be willing to do this. 

In baseball, a player may declare for the draft as an underclassman, decline to sign, and be drafted again his senior year. This is a process known as "redrafting." Aggressive agents like Scott Boras use the redrafting process to maximize the signing bonuses of their clients. In 2012, Stanford pitcher Mark Appel was near top of the amateur rankings at the end of his junior year, but was not drafted early because of concerns about his "signability" if he was anything other than the number one choice. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates with the eighth overall pick but declined to sign, thereby vindicating his doubters. In 2013, he was drafted at the end of his senior year by the Houston Astros with the first overall pick, and a maximum signing bonus.
