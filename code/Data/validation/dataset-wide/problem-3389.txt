Either you need to lump things together, or you need to further split things up, or you need to give a reason to point to just these 4 distinctions. Making distinctions at all is arbitrary if it doesn't serve some function. For example, are you talking broadly about the entire history of a language, or are you talking about the status of words right now, in the minds of an actual speaker? "Bard" is a word of Modern English (defined as "the language that I learned as a child"), which was inherited from later pre-Modern English (defined as "the language that my parents learned as children"), and so on for generations and generations, until you get to the point where it is "borrowed" and is in your category (d). The same for "dog", "portal", "count", "egg", probably "ax", and possibly "cow". Your (c) is not exemplified by "computer", which is based on French, but might be illustrated by the word "Kodak" which is reputed to be actually created out of thin air. Similar examples are "spliff" and "flarn". You can't presuppose that "word of English" is self-evident. For example, are "tapas", "pecorino" and "guanciale" words of English? I am inclined to say they are, although they have come into English rather recently. Most people don't know what "guanciale" is; fewer people know what a "tanbour" is, but they are used in ordinary English conversations at least by people who talk about such things. The word "x̌ax̌yaƛ'" (borrowed, sort of, from Lushootseed) is not used by very many people at all – most people who make it don't seem to know the name – but has been used in monolingual conversations. I suspect that only one other SE user knows the word. There is no technical definition of "word of English". You don't want the notion to be defined in terms of "majority of English speakers know", because that would exclude vast numbers of English words ("spline, quark, panoply, masticate, obfuscation"). The core of your problem lies in defining what is "a word of English". 

I think we can confidently conclude that there are two or even more conflicting definitions of "sentence". Analogously, there are multiple definitions of "markedness". However, your first quote: 

FT refers to what can arise, given all possible orderings of constraints. Each ordering defines a language. Since the set of constraints is rather large, conventionally one focuses on the constraints of interest, by excluding any that don't seem relevant (e.g. *Round which prohibits round sound – not relevant to the issue at hand). Also in testing the implications of an ordering, you have to test it against all linguistically-possible inputs, for example /pa, p'a, ba, pʰa, ɓa, mpa, bʰa, ma/ and so on, even if some of those segments don't exist in the language. If you have #1 = *Voiced-Obst (a standard stipulation) and #2 = ID-IO voice (also standard), there are only two orders, 1,2 and 2,1. the relevant candidate subset is the product of any input combined with any output, e.g. {pa, p'a}, {pa, pa}, {pa, ba}, {pa, ma}, {ba, pʰa}, {ba, ba}, {p'a, p'a}, {p'a, ba}, {p'a, pa} and so on, where the first string is the input the the second is the proposed output. In the grammar where 2 > 1 (the faithfulness constraint is dominant), and since there are, for the sake of discussion, no other constraints, the winning candidates will be {pa, pa}, {ma, ma}, {ba, ba}, {p'a, p'a}, {ɓa, ɓa} and so on. When 1 > 2, the winners are {pa, pa}, {ma, ma}, {ba, pa}, {p'a, p'a}, {ɓa, p'a}: any voiced obstruent must be eliminated. Of course there are other constraints, so you ultimately have to throw in those constraints. For example, there would be a constraint *CG which prohibits glottalized consonants like implosives and ejectives, so if the language in question has no implosives or ejectives, the markedness constraint *CG would have to dominate the faithfulness constraint ID-IO(CG). An implicational universal, under OT, is the result of all possible orderings of constraints yielding a particular fact pattern, such as that if a language has voiced obstruents, it also has voiceless obstruents. In order for the method to work, you also have to stipulate the non-existence of certain constraints, for example *Voiceless-Obstruent. If there were such a constraint, then ordering *Voiceless-Obstruent first would mean that all obstruents have to be voiced. As for tableaux, you would create a set of meta-tableaux which contain just the segment of interest (not even the vowel) and just the constraints of interest, in both orders. The inputs of interest include (in the case of an IO constraint plus a markedness constraint) those with the prohibited value and those with the allowed value. If given all inputs and all ordering of those constraint, the voiced segment is not ever pointed at, you've derived the implicational universal. As far as I can see, *Vioced-Coda is irrelevant, except by way of explaining how a language could exist with final devoicing, but that is a separate complication. 

No. Here is some examples. "A system of rules that assigns […] meaning in a definite way is known as 'semantics'" cannot be changed to "Semantics is known as 'semantics'". Also, anybody who says "I'm trying to discover a system of rules that assigns […] meaning in a definite way" would not say "I'm trying to discover semantics". I don't understand the value of "[...]" in your question. Semantics does not do phonology, in case that is what you are asking. Or are you asking if Chomsky thought at the time that semantics does phonology (analogous to the current apparent belief that word order is determined by phonology)? It's not exactly clear what your question is. In that historical context, your 3 is not a correct restatement of 1, since you failed to include syntax, which at the time (and as far as I know, still) has not been subsumed under phonology. 

The UCLA phonetics lab has a web page that hosts the materials on the CDs of Peter Ladefoged's books. Here is a link to his performances of the IPA chart. [EDIT] This is too long to feed into a comment. NTNU has a web page with IPA recordings, which does not work. They have a Norwegian version here, which does work. You can also download the relevant files where it says "Last ned norske_spraklyder.zip" (i.e. click this) which will give you a zip file with the folder "norske_spraklyder". If you unzip the file and go to that directory, then navigate to the folder "no", you can click "index.html". Under "Innhold" you have the option of "Konsonanter", "Vokaler", and let's skip the other two. It's quite possible that this still won't play (browser configuration stuff), but in theory you now have the material on your computer. The sound files are in the subdirectory "snd". So if you want to hear "p", you can hover over "p" and it will tell you that the sound is "IPA101", so you can click IPA101.mp3 and hear [aˈpʰa]. You can also click IPA101_i.mp3 and hear a female speaker's production. 

It is alive enough that there is a Wikipedia entry. It is a dialect of Kabyle Berber indigenously called Taqbaylit ([ˈθɐqβæjlɪθ] if Wiki is to be believed). Shaltz doesn't get more specific than say "Northeast zone" and doesn't name the specific village. (The mapping from speling to pronunciation they give conforms to what I know of Berber phonology; ta-...-t is feminine noun inflection so the root qbayl is basically the same as the root Kabyle). 

The Zoque numbers for "8" are sufficiently similar to the numbers in the other languages that I could accept that these reflect the earlier situation, whereas "9" diverges substantially. You can engage in the exercise of comparing the bits of these numerals and discern partial similarities across the languages. Zoque "9" makstuhtaʼ looks like it contains "4" makšku, but it also looks like it contains "10" mahkaʼ ("1 from 10"). Zoque "6" and "3" seem to have common elements. Zoque "12" seems to have the elements of "10" and "2", except that that "2" element itself is only found in Popoluca. There is a common enough historical pattern across languages that adjacent numbers influence each other. If "8" tukuduhtaʼ looks like "3-6", and if Zoque "9" should have been takstuhta, then it is not surprising that Zoque "4" makšku could have influenced the change of takstuhta to makstuhta. There is an analogous influence in Russian (and maybe all of Slavic, I don't know) where expected nev'at' appears as dev'at', under the influence of des'at' "10", and similarly "8" vos'em was influence by "7" s'em. 

I don't understand what would make such a gloss "Anglocentric", especially since "proximal" and "animate" are Latinate terms. I only partially understand "clunky". You have to distinguish between translations of linguistic material (into English, or whatever language you are writing in), and word/morpheme glosses. A translation would not be "Ego.nominative see.recent-past non-ego--discourse-participant.accusative", it would be an idiomatic English sentence like "I saw you". The morpheme gloss would be the place for such subtleties. To be useful, such glosses need to be compact (few letters), which usually means abbreviated (which implies a table of abbreviations). If the language has polymorphemic pronouns with independent elements separately marking "animate" vs. "inanimate", "proximal" versus "distal", "visible" vs. "referential" which allows 8 distinct pronoun forms, then abbreviations like "an./inan.", "prox./dist.", "vis./ref." might work. A gloss like "3per.ANIM.PROX" implies that there are three separate morphemes with isolable grammatical functions, and I don't know if that is what you mean. Sometimes there is a simple split in 3rd person forms between e.g. "animate singular proximal" and "others", where one class has some semantic property but the other is of the category "anything else". A morpheme/word gloss is not the correct place for a discussion of semantic distinctions, and in such a case, you would be better off using an arbitrary distinction "A" vs. "B", where you explain in the relevant section on word classes that A words are all animate singular proximal, and anything else is B.
