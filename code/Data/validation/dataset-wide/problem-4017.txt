Apparently you can compute the h^{p,q}'s of smooth things in, for example, Macaulay. Here's an example: computing the h^{p,q}'s of a quintic hypersurface in P^4. 

When I think of a "simplicial complex", I think of the geometric realization of a simplicial set (a simplicial object in the category of sets). I'll refer to this as "the first definition". However, there is another definition of "simplicial complex", e.g. the one on wikipedia: it's a collection $K$ of simplices such that any face of any simplex in $K$ is also in $K$, and the intersection of two simplices of $K$ is a face of both of the two simplices. There is also the notion of "abstract simplicial complex", which is a collection of subsets of $\{ 1, \dots, n \}$ which is closed under the operation of taking subsets. These kinds of simplicial complexes also have corresponding geometric realizations as topological spaces. I'll refer to both of these definitions as "the second definition". The second definition looks reasonable at first sight, but then you quickly run into some horrible things, like the fact that triangulating even something simple like a torus requires some ridiculous number of simplices (more than 20?). On the other hand, you can triangulate the torus much more reasonably using the first definition (or alternatively using the definition of "Delta complex" from Hatcher's algebraic topology book, but this is not too far from the first definition anyway). I believe you can move back and forth between the two definitions without much trouble. (I think you can go from the first to the second by doing some barycentric subdivisions, and going from the second to the first is trivial.) Due to the fact that the second definition is the one that's listed on wikipedia, I get the impression that people still use this definition. My questions are: 

I suspect this is something embarrassingly standard and/or obvious and/or well-known and/or classical, but I haven't been able to figure anything out. The only thing along these lines that I was able to figure out was how to compute the Euler characteristic $\chi(J;\Theta^k)$ where $k$ is an integer: By Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch and the Poincare formula it's $$\int_J \operatorname{ch}(\Theta^k) = \int_J e^{k\theta} = \int_J k^g \theta^g / g! = k^g.$$ 

My favorite example of moduli spaces are Grassmannians and in particular projective spaces. Check out exercises 5, 6, and 7 of this: $URL$ 

The standard situation in Kodaira-Spencer's work is the following: If you're on the algebraic side and you have a smooth ("smooth" in the sense of algebraic geometry) and proper (proper in the sense of algebraic geometry) map $\pi: X \to Y$ , then when you translate this to the analytic side, "smooth" turns into "submersion" (in the sense of: pushforward of vector fields is surjective), and "proper" turns into "proper" (in the sense of: inverse image of compact set is compact). And "map" turns into "holomorphic map". Then you can use, for instance, the "preimage theorem" (be careful to not get confused by the usage of "smooth" in that article --- there smooth means $C^\infty$) to deduce that the fibers are holomorphic complex manifolds. Strictly speaking we must use the holomorphic version of the "preimage theorem". But the holomorphic version does hold, as do holomorphic versions of other standard theorems like implicit function theorem and inverse function theorem. Perhaps this is in Chapter 0 of Griffiths-Harris, or Chapter 1 of Huybrechts. The fibers are compact because a point is compact. :) 

Kontsevich's 1994 paper "Homological Algebra of Mirror Symmetry" has been very inspiring to me. It is full of tantalizing ideas and speculations, and brings so many different aspects of mathematics (and physics!) together into one beautiful tapestry. 

Let $J^d$ be the degree $d$ Jacobian variety, parameterizing degree $d$ line bundles. Let $P^0$ be a degree $0$ Poincare bundle on $E \times J^0$. Let $x$ be a point of $E$. The bundle $p^\ast (\mathcal{O}_E(nx)) \otimes P^0$ on $E \times J^0$ is the pullback of a degree $n$ Poincare bundle $P^n$ on $E \times J^n$ along the map $\operatorname{id}_E \times (- \otimes \mathcal{O}_E(nx)) : E \times J^0 \to E \times J^n$. This map is clearly an isomorphism. By Proposition 2.1 on page 309 of Arbarello-Cornalba-Griffiths-Harris [for a more comprehensive treatment of this result, see Schwarzenberger's "Jacobians and Symmetric Products"], for $n \geq 1$, (the total space of) the projectivization of the sheaf $q_\ast(P^n)$ is isomorphic to the $n$th symmetric power of $E$, and under this isomorphism, the map from this projective bundle to $J^0 \cong E$ is the Abel-Jacobi map. Hence the same is true for the projectivization of $q_\ast(p^\ast (\mathcal{O}_E(nx)) \otimes P^0)$. 

It depends on what you mean by "simple". If you know homology, the proof is not very hard (less than 1 page), see for example, section 2.B ("Classical Applications") of Hatcher's book "Algebraic Topology". 

When I was an undergraduate I read the book Intuitive Topology by Prasolov. It's a wonderful illustrated guide to low-dimensional topology (mostly knots/links and surfaces). If I recall correctly, almost all of the "proofs" are by pictures. 

My favorite parts of Sylvia Nasar's A Beautiful Mind (the book, not the movie) were the parts which described the Princeton math department in the 40s and 50s. 

(Sorry for the proliferation of parentheses, and sorry for my lack of certainty on all of this, I have not thought about this in a while. People should definitely correct me if I'm wrong on any of this.) 

For which manifolds or varieties is quantum cohomology known to converge? Are there any manifolds for which quantum cohomology is known to not converge? I seem to have the impression that quantum cohomology is known to converge for Fano manifolds or maybe toric Fano manifolds, but I don't know if this is actually true. By "convergence" I mean convergence of, e.g., the genus 0 Gromov-Witten potential. 

Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g \geq 1$ and let $J^d$ be its degree $d$ Jacobian. Inside of $J^{g-1}$ there is the Theta divisor $\Theta$, which can be defined in various ways; the quickest definition is probably: it's the image of the Abel-Jacobi map $C^{(g-1)} \to J^{g-1}$ sending an effective degree $g-1$ divisor to the corresponding line bundle. Picking an isomorphism $J^{g-1} \cong J^d$, we also write $\Theta$ for the corresponding divisor in $J^d$. 

Let $X$ be a nice variety over $\mathbb{C}$, where nice probably means smooth and proper. I want to know: How can we show that the hypercohomology of the algebraic de Rham complex agrees with the hypercohomology of the analytic de Rham complex (equivalently the cohomology of the constant sheaf $\mathbb{C}$ in the analytic topology)? Does this follow immediately from GAGA? If not, how do you prove it? I think that this does not follow immediately from GAGA because, while the sheaves $\Omega_X^i$ are coherent, the de Rham $d$ is not a map of coherent sheaves (it is not multiplicative). Am I correct in my thinking? 

I don't know, but I attended a talk by John Conway on this sort of stuff at Berkeley last year. Unfortunately I didn't take notes, but below is the abstract from the talk. Nearly Universal Quadric Forms I’m rather proud of having proved the “Fifteen Theorem,” according to which one can check that a positive definite quadratic form with integral matrix represents all positive integers provided only that it represents those up to 15. I’m almost as proud of having made the “290 Conjecture,” now proved by Bhargava and Hanke, that performs the similar service for integer valued forms. Why? – because together these two theorems end more than 200 years of work on universal quadratic forms, the first theorem in that subject being Lagrange’s 1770 Four Squares Theorem. It’s now time to try to do the same for near-universality of three-dimensional forms, which subject was begun by Legendre’s much subtler Three Squares Theorem of 1798. 

Please share any general tips or advice you have on doing mathematical research. How do you identify good problems to work on or to think about? What do you do when you get stuck on a problem? Etc. 

It is an easy exercise to show that the standard definition of a manifold is equivalent to the ringed spaces definition of a manifold. (Try it!) The latter definition is nice because the sheaf condition gets rid of the need for all that "maximal atlas" business. 

* The gluing maps here are the obvious gluing maps. ** The homotopy equivalence induces a quasi-isomorphism of the chain complexes. We're working with chain complexes everywhere, and it's OK to replace things with quasi-isomorphic things. *** I think that we can define maps, for instance, $M_{g,n} \times M_{g',n'} \to M_{g+g',n+n'-2}$ by taking two Riemann surfaces with marked points and gluing them together at some specified marked points to obtain a nodal Riemann surface, and then smoothing out that node. This doesn't really make sense on the level of topological spaces because there's no canonical way to smooth out the node. However, again since we're working not with spaces but chains on spaces, I think this is OK because the different ways of smoothing out the node are the same, up to homotopy; in other words, there are many different possible maps of topological spaces $M_{g,n} \times M_{g',n'} \to M_{g+g',n+n'-2}$, but they're all homotopic, so on the level of chains the different maps are also (chain) homotopic. **** The gluing maps here are the standard maps $\overline{M}\_{g,n} \times \overline{M}\_{g',n'} \to \overline{M}\_{g+g',n+n'-2}$. This is essentially the standard notion of "cohomological field theory" as defined by Kontsevich-Manin. 

I think it can be difficult for many people to appreciate math "for its own sake". We mathematicians usually find, for example, the infinitude of primes, and the proof thereof, to be pretty awesome. But I don't think that you can expect most people to react to such things the same way that we do. I think the reason is because, as in the Gelfand quote, it is often not apparent how these things connect to "the real world", and it is often not apparent that these kinds of considerations can arise very naturally. So to get people excited about math, I think that it can be useful to first get them to care about a problem or arouse their curiosity in something, and then demonstrate that math can be used to solve that problem. This nice TED talk also argues for this point. Sorry for rambling... 

I have several naive and possibly stupid questions about deformations of categories. I hope that someone can at least point me to some appropriate references. What is a deformation of a (linear, dg, A-infinity) category? Is it a "bundle of categories" over a scheme? How can you make such a notion rigorous? Maybe via stacks? Suppose we take some nice scheme $X$ and we consider $D^b\text{Coh}(X)$; if we deform $X$, then do we also get a corresponding deformation of the derived category? What does this corresponding deformation "look like"? Are we deforming the morphisms? The objects? Both? Similarly, what about in the situation where we have a category of modules over an algebra $A$? If we deform the algebra, then do we also get a corresponding deformation of the category? Again, what does it "look like"? And finally, in either of the above cases, are there deformations of the respective categories that don't correspond to deformations of $X$ or of $A$ respectively? I expect the answer to be "yes"; then my next question is: Are there any nice examples of such deformations that can still be described in an explicit or geometric way? I am most of all interested in concrete examples, and less interested in general theory.
