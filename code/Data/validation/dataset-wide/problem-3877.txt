Hadamard matrices may be characterized as $n\times n$ real orthogonal matrices $U$ that achieve the lowest possible "energy" as defined by the (scaled and shifted) entry-wise 1-norm: $$ E(U)=n^2 -\sqrt{n}\,\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n |U_{i j}|. $$ We'll consider only those $n$ for which Hadamard matrices exist; their energy is zero. I'm interested in the minimum energy "barrier" between distinct Hadamard matrices. Let $U_0$ and $U_1$ be distinct Hadamard matrices and $U_t$ a continuous map from the unit interval to orthogonal matrices (a "curve") with these matrices as endpoints. The energy barrier, for this curve, is the maximum over $t$ of the energy: $$ \Delta E(U_t)=\max_t E(U_t). $$ Finally, define $\Delta E$ as the infimum of energy barriers over all curves that join any pair of distinct Hadamard matrices. $\Delta E$ is easily bounded above by $90^\circ$ Givens rotations (as curves) that have the effect of swapping two rows or columns of a Hadamard matrix; the maximum energy, at the halfway point, is $(2-\sqrt{2})n$. Is this bound sharp, or are there smaller barriers? 

The central limit property of $h$ follows from the main result of: David Freedman and David Lane, "The Empirical Distribution of Fourier Coefficients", Ann. Statist. Volume 8, Number 6 (1980), 1244-1251. They show that all the Fourier coefficients (not trivially related as complex conjugates) are asymptotically independent. 

It is well known that the space $\{0,1\}^{\kappa}$ satisfies the countable chain condition. Recall that a topological space $X$ satisfies the countable chain condition if and only if every collection $\mathcal{A}$ of pairwise disjoint open sets is countable. However, it is easy to show that the surjective continuous image of a space satisfying the countable chain condition must also satisfy the countable chain condition, so the only possible spaces which are images of some $\{0,1\}^{\kappa}$ satisfy the countable chain condition. However, there are plenty of compact Hausdorff spaces that do not satisfy the countable chain condition such as $\beta\mathbb{N}\setminus\mathbb{N}$ or $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ with the order topology inherited from the lexicographic ordering. To see that $\{0,1\}^{\kappa}$ satisfies the countable chain condition, endow $\{0,1\}^{\kappa}$ with the infinite product measure $m$ where each $\{0,1\}$ is given the measure $\mu$ such that $\mu(\{0\})=\frac{1}{2}$ and $\mu(\{1\})=\frac{1}{2}$. Then $m$ extends to a Borel measure $\overline{m}$ on $\{0,1\}^{\kappa}$ where $\overline{m}(U)>0$ for each non-empty open set $U$. However, there cannot be an uncountable collection $\mathcal{A}$ of disjoint open subsets of $X$ since the union of any uncountable pairwise disjoint collection of open subsets of $X$ would have infinite measure. 

A self-distributive algebra is a structure $(X,*)$ where $*$ is a binary operation that satisfies the identity $x*(y*z)=(x*y)*(x*z)$. Let $L,T:X^{2}\rightarrow X^{2}$ be the operations where $L(x,y)=(x*y,x),T(x,y)=(y,x)$. Then we say that $(X,*)$ is partially permutative if for all $x,y\in X$, there is some $n$ such that for all $m$, we have $L^{n+m}(x,y)=T^{m}L^{n}(x,y)$. The $n$-th permutatability number $t_{n}$ is the least number such that if $|X|\leq n$ and $X$ is partially permutative, then for all $x,y\in X$ we have $L^{t_{n}+m}(x,y)=T^{m}L^{t_{n}}(x,y)$. What are some bounds of the growth rate of the number $t_{n}$? If there exists a rank-into-rank cardinal, then we know that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}t_{n}=\infty$. Can we even establish that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}t_{n}=\infty$ in ZFC? 

Consider the random variable $S=(s_0, \dots ,s_{N-1})$, a sequence of signs uniformly distributed on the hypercube $\{-1,1\}^N$. With the Fourier transform we can define $N$ random walk variables $$ \hat{s}_q=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \zeta^{q k} s_k, \qquad q=0, \ldots, N-1, $$ where $\zeta=e^{2\pi i/N}$ and to keep things simple we take $N$ to be prime. As we take $N\to\infty$ all of these have normal distributions: $\hat{s}_0$ on the real line and the others in the complex plane. I would like to be able to claim that these random variables become independent as $N\to\infty$ in a certain qualified sense. First, since $\hat{s}_q$ and $\hat{s}_{-q}$ are complex conjugates we only consider $q\in\{1,\ldots,(N-1)/2\}$. Second, I am only interested in "fixed-information" counterparts of these. We define these random variables as $f(\hat{s}_q)$, where $f$ maps the complex plane to a finite set. For example (in fact the case that generated this question), $f$ might be take the magnitude of the complex number and round it to 7 significant digits, or to $\infty$ if the magnitude exceeds a certain bound (in order to keep the cardinality of the range of $f$ fixed as $N\to\infty$). Is it true, say for particular kinds of fixed-information maps, that $f(\hat{s}_q)$ and $f(\hat{s}_{q'})$, $q\ne q'$, are independent as $N\to\infty$? 

I can't say I share Littlewood's sense of humor, but here is a formula that made me grin the first time I saw it ($A$ and $B$ are non-commuting square matrices): \begin{equation}\frac{d}{dt}e^{A+B t}=\int_0^1 e^{s(A+B t)}\ B\ e^{(1-s)(A+B t)} \ ds. \end{equation} 

The simplest example of a left-separated space would be a countable $T_{1}$-space. If $X$ is a countable $T_{1}$-space, then if $<$ is a well ordering on $X$ such that $(X,<)$ is order isomorphic to the natural numbers, then every initial segment in $X$ is closed. For instance, $\mathbb{Q}$ is left separated. We may generalize this example to get more examples of left-separated spaces with good separation axioms without messing with ordinals. If $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal, then a $P_{\kappa}$-space is a topological space where the intersection of less than $\kappa$ many open sets is open. $P_{\kappa}$ spaces are easy to come by since one can transform any topological space $X$ into a $P_{\kappa}$-space $(X)_{\kappa}$ by declaring the intersection of less than $\kappa$ many open sets to be open. If $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal and $X$ is a $T_{1}$ $P_{\kappa}$-space of cardinality $\kappa$, then $X$ is left-separated by the same argument as with countable $T_{1}$-spaces. In particular, if $X$ is a $T_{1}$-space (Hausdorff, regular) with $|X|\leq\kappa$, then $(X)_{\kappa}$ is left-separated (and Hausdorff, regular). Of course, if you do like messing with ordinals, then one can put a left-separated topology on an ordinal $\alpha$ by making sure that every point $\beta<\alpha$ has $[\beta,\alpha)$ as a neighborhood. In particular, if $Z_{\beta}$ is a filter on $\alpha$ with $[\beta,\alpha)\in Z_{\beta}$ for each $\beta<\alpha$, then we may topologize $\alpha$ by letting $U\subseteq\alpha$ be open if $U\in Z_{\beta}$ whenever $\beta\in U$. This topology will be left-separated and any left-separated space can be formed by this construction. 

I'm interested in a family of properties of connected simple graphs that comes up in percolation theory. Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. Now consider the set of subgraphs of $G$ that I will call "cores". A core $C$ of $G$ is a connected subgraph of $G$ with the property that upon "removing" $C$ from $G$ the resulting graph has no edges. I define "removing" as deleting from $G$ all vertices and edges in $C$. Note that a core is not the same as the induced subgraph of a connected dominating set (which makes reference only to the vertices of $C$ and not its edges). For example, the triangle graph has 1 core which is the triangle graph itself, 3 cores that are chains of 3 vertices, and 3 cores that are chains of 2 vertices. The properties are defined by sums over all the cores: $f_k(G)=(-1)^{v(G)+1}\sum_{\mathrm{cores}\, C\in G} v(C)^k (-1)^{e(C)}$. Here $v(C)$ and $e(C)$ are respectively the number of vertices and edges in $C$, and $k$ is a non-negative integer. I've proved that $f_1(G)=0$ for every connected $G$ except for the 1-vertex graph, for which $f_1=1$. I therefore do not need a name for property $f_1$. What about $f_2$? Here are some special cases. When $G$ is a tree with $n>1$ vertices, then $f_2(G)=0$ unless it is a path; for that case $f_2(G)=2$. Now consider cycles of length $n$. For these the $f_2$ values are $n(n-1)$ . For the complete graphs $f_2(K_n)=n!$ . Perhaps these special cases will help someone make the connection with a known property. Addendum: I welcome suggestions for a better term for what I've called a graph "core". Here is a rewording of the definition, in case there is still confusion. A core $C$ of a connected graph $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ induced by a subset of the edges of $G$ and which has the following two properties: (1) $C$ is connected, and (2) every edge of $G$ is incident on a vertex of $C$. It's not obvious from the definition of $f_k(G)$ that these integers are always nonnegative, but I believe this is true for all positive $k$. Is $f_k(G)$ counting something in $G$? If so, then the definition in terms of cores (and the naming problem) can be avoided. 

Could you give an example of an algebra that satisfies the theory $T^{+}$ or which do not satisfy the identity $(x*x)*y=x*y$ (algebras that satisfy this identity embed into racks)? I prefer computable structures rather than structures obtained by the compactness theorem. I also prefer complicated structures (like braid groups) as opposed to basic structures (like the integers). Is there an algebra $X$ that satisfies $T$ (or $T^{+}$) where each $x\in X$ freely generates a subalgebra of $X$? Does there exist an algebra $X$ that satisfies $T$ (or $T^{+}$) where each for all $x\in X$ there exists some $y\in X$ with $y\neq x$ and where $x,y$ freely generate a subalgebra of $X$? 

The partial orders $X$ which there is a countable increasing sequence that is cofinal in $X$ are precisely the partial orders which are $\textbf{Tukey equivalent to $\omega$}$. Recall that a subset $D$ of a poset $X$ is cofinal if for all $x\in X$ there is some $d\in D$ with $x\leq d$ and we say that $D$ is unbounded if there is no $x\in X$ where $D\subseteq\downarrow x$. If $X,Y$ are partial ordering, then a function $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is said to be cofinal if whenever $D$ is a cofinal subset of $X$, then $f[D]$ is cofinal in $Y$. A function $g:Y\rightarrow X$ is said to be a Tukey map or an unbounded map if the image of an unbounded set in $Y$ is unbounded in $X$. We say that $X\leq_{T}Y$ ($X$ is Tukey below $Y$) if there is some cofinal mapping $f:Y\rightarrow X$. Equivalently, $X\leq_{T}Y$ if there is some Tukey mapping $g:X\rightarrow Y$. We say that $X\equiv_{T}Y$ ($X$ is Tukey equivalent to $Y$) if $X\leq_{T}Y$ and $Y\leq_{T}X$. The posets with Tukey type $\omega$ are precisely the posets $X$ with a countable cofinal chain. 

Consider the random variable $S=(s_0, \dots ,s_{N-1})$, a sequence of signs uniformly distributed on the hypercube $\{-1,1\}^N$. We are interested in $N$ large and prime. The Fourier transform $\hat{S}=(\hat{s}_0, \dots ,\hat{s}_{N-1})$, where $$ \hat{s}_q=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \zeta^{q k} s_k, \qquad \zeta=e^{2\pi i/N}, $$ defines a new multivariate random variable. Finally, consider the univariate random variable $$ h=\left(\prod_{q=1}^{N-1}\hat{s}_q\right)^\frac{1}{N-1}=\left(\prod_{q=1}^{(N-1)/2}|\hat{s}_q|^2\right)^\frac{1}{N-1}. $$ This variable is the scaled algebraic norm of the cyclotomic integer whose coefficients are $S$. I would like to prove that $h$ has the central limit property for $N\to \infty$, that is, its distribution becomes increasingly concentrated at one value. The plausibility argument goes like this. Consider a "baby" estimator of the variable given by the geometric mean of a fixed number $M$ of the $|\hat{s}_q|^2$, instead of all $(N-1)/2$. For this fixed number of Fourier transform components we have a multivariate central limit theorem, for $N\to \infty$. When we apply CLT and compute the covariance matrix, we find that these $|\hat{s}_q|^2$ are independent and identically distributed random variables. The baby estimators therefore have the central limit property for $M\to\infty$. Unfortunately, the $M\to\infty$ limit of the baby estimators may be a different random variable than the $N\to \infty$ limit of $h$. 

With help, offline, from P. Diaconis: I believe my "fixed information" map is really just a license to take the limit $N\to \infty$ before asking if the random variables are independent. Now, if I exercise this license, I notice that $\hat{s}_q$ and $\hat{s}_{q'}$ have a bivariate normal distribution (in the limit), and when I work out the covariance matrix, which I can do for finite $N$, I see that indeed the two variables are independent for $q\ne q'$ (taking the $N\to \infty$ limit of the covariance matrix). 

I am unsure of where you seem to be going at by the notion of structure, but I must mention a certain specific structure sometimes associated with ultrafilters. If $A$ is a set (the set $A$ is usually taken to be infinite), then let $\mathfrak{C}(A)$ be the structure over a language $L_{A}$ with underlying set $A$ such that every function on $A$ is a fundamental operation, every relation is a fundamental relation, and every element of $A$ is a fundamental constant. Let $T_{A}=\mathrm{Th}(\mathfrak{C}(A))$. Then for each ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$, we associate the ultrapower $\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{U}}$. It turns out that each model of $T_{A}$ is a generalized ultrapower of $\mathfrak{C}(A)$ called a limit ultrapower (See Chang and Keisler's book on model theory for a proof of this fact). Furthermore, the finitely generated algebras in $\mathfrak{C}(A)$ are up-to-isomorphism precisely the ultrapowers $\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{U}}$ for some ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ on a set of cardinality at most $|A|$. The models of $T_{A}$ are very useful when investigating ultrafilters and even different ultrapower constructions since all the information about an ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ (or generalized ultrapower construction) is wrapped up in the ultrapower $\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{U}}$ for sufficiently large $A$. Suppose that $\mathcal{U},\mathcal{V}$ are ultrafilters on sets of cardinality at most $|A|$. Then $\mathcal{U}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are Rudin-Keisler equivalent if and only if $\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{U}}\simeq\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{V}}$ if and only if $\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{U}}\simeq\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{V}}$ for all structures $\mathcal{A}$. Furthermore, $\mathcal{U}\leq_{RK}\mathcal{V}$ if and only if $\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{U}}$ is elementarily embeddable in $\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{V}}$. Similar results hold for direct limits of ultrapowers. Suppose that $(\mathcal{U})_{d\in D},(\mathcal{V})_{e\in E}$ are inverse systems of ultrafilters. Then we have the following for sufficiently large sets $A$: the inverse systems $(\mathcal{U}_{d})_{d\in D},(\mathcal{V}_{e})_{e\in E}$ are isomorphic (in the pro-completion of the category of ultrafilters) if and only if $\varinjlim\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{U}_{d}}\simeq\varinjlim\mathfrak{C}(A)^{\mathcal{V}_{e}}$ if and only if $\varinjlim\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{U}_{d}}\simeq\varinjlim\mathcal{A}^{\mathcal{V}_{e}}$. Of course, in a large cardinal context, there does not seem to be as much of a need to consider ultrapowers of $\mathfrak{C}(A)$ since one can just take ultrapowers the hierarchy of sets $V$.
