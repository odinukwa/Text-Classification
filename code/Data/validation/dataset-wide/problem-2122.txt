If you still get grief from this manager, you have two options: Either ignore the manager if they are in no way related to you or your dept/team or ask for clarification on the official policy when it comes to the chat channels. 

It sounds like you have been recommended for a high profile project and you have been recommended and accepted for a promotion as well. First off, congrats on the recognition and the promotion. As for recommended action you should take, I would suggest (as you mentioned) gentle reminders to your manager or senior manager (whoever is in charge of getting the promotion done) every 2-3 weeks. Promotions typically need several people to sign off on it and it has to go through several departments (HR, finance, etc.) to solidify it. It does not happen overnight, but it will happen as long as the right people have said 'yes' to it. The good part is that you do not have to fight for it or build a case for it since you have already been recommended for it and the recommendation has been accepted. Just send follow ups every once in a while and ask about the status of it from your manager. 

Your documentation should be 100% neutral. As you mentioned, you should not put any of your personal input into the documentation regarding how you feel about the project, people who worked on the project, design details, etc. If you kept a good paper trail or have the paper trail from the people who were on the project, you will be fine since it will be clear you were not the one making the poor decisions. As for your new documentation, it can be done without mentioning anyone specific. For example, "Tom decided to denormalize the database tables in order to make the code easier to write, but in the end it became unmanageable and hard to work with" could be rewritten as "The decision made regarding data storage was to denormalize the database tables in order to reduce the amount of code needed to be written on the app side. However, the data became very hard to manage due to a lack of good relationships and structure among the data and tables". This allows you to still clearly communicate the issue and what happened without blaming. The assigning blame comes when you provide emails, meeting minutes, and anything else to develop a paper trail of how decisions were made. Again, you remain neutral as the person who is doing the documentation, but you provide any relevant communication and let the reader come to the logical conclusion based on the content. If there is an email chain where you disagree with a decision or you weren't even part of a decision that ended up failing, anyone reading the email will understand it was not your fault. 

In my opinion, your priorities and obligations when it relates to work should be to yourself, your health, your relationships, and your career path. Again, in my opinion, company loyalty should not be considered because no matter what, you will always be replaceable and if it benefits the company, you will be replaced. While you are employed by your company, you should work as if you are going to be there for the next 30 years and retire there right up until the moment that you leave for your next opportunity. If your new gig falls through, then nothing happens. If your new gig works out, you can pursue it as long as your employment contract permits it. Your company will get by. If the whole contract falls through because you leave, that is a huge failure on the part of management for not having a manageable bus-factor. You can use your unique position to make sure there is sufficient knowledge sharing and redundancy on the project to accommodate a loss of a teammate for any reason. That should not be viewed as odd by anyone on your team since it is just good practice. That way, if you leave, the team moves on and can absorb your absence and if you don't leave, nothing is impacted. 

I would suggest you do nothing. You can decide how you want the friendship to move forward, but as far as professionally, do not do anything. A person who requires a reference to be 100% fabricated will be found out pretty soon anyway due to most likely not having any of the skills/abilities discussed in the reference. This person could have done this before (or do it again in the future) without telling you and you would not have been (will not be) the wiser. If this person goes down in flames, no one is going to contact you about what you said in the reference. Now, if this is a company that you want to work for in the future or you do business with in some manner, you may want to reconsider saying something. 

Get your CV and resume polished right now and have them prepared to send over. If you are on good terms with your previous manager, I would call him/her immediately. Do the usual pleasantries, and then mention you saw the posting on the site and ask for any information about it, specifically ask if the company is looking at summer graduates or if they are looking to fill the position right away. If they are looking at summer grads, say you are immensely interested, you loved your time there previously, and ask the manager how he/she would recommend you applying. He/she should be able to guide you from there (might say you can apply as a previous employee or some other method that will potentially give you preference). If you are unable to get a hold of your manager, send an email right now to him/her with everything mentioned above and also say you are planning on submitting your resume tomorrow. At least in this case, your previous manager is aware that your resume will be coming and can assist if possible. 

It is considerate to give a little sign off when doing something like this. Whether it is excusing yourself from a meeting, asking to be removed from an unruly email chain with too many cc's, a Skype chat, a MS Teams channel, a Slack channel, etc. It doesn't have to be much, but enough to let everyone know you are leaving the chat and are still available if they need you. 

First things first: try to break the ice or start a conversation. Start out by trying to find people you have things in common with and people you enjoy talking to. When you are walking around the office, take a look at what people have on their desks. Pictures, awards, trinkets, etc. If someone has a football team flag and you know remotely anything about football, make a casual comment along the lines of "Hey, [your team name] had a great game last week! Have you been a lifelong fan? Are you originally from there?". If they have a picture of the family and kids, ask about how old they are or if you have kids, maybe they go to the same school or there is a school rivalry. You are looking for anything you have in common to open the door for a conversation. Another thing to keep in mind is that people are busy. Especially people with children and active lives outside of work. If you are a younger dev or a person with no kids, chances are you have way more time than people who have to worry about getting a bunch of kids to various school events, after school stuff, etc. Those people may not have time to go catch a movie or go to happy hours. Just be friendly, find some people with similar interests, and take baby steps. Start with a casual chat at the watercooler, move it up to going to grab lunch together, and then work it up to a after work happy hour. Don't expect to become best buds or inseparable after only a couple weeks. 

Jump ship and jump ship fast. They are saying they need you and imploring you to stay to cover their hide. If things were going well and the outlook was positive, they would not be hemorrhaging staff and clients. If this company loses another client or declares bankruptcy, do you think they are going to continue cutting you checks to cover bills and your mortgage/rent? Unless you have in writing that they are giving you a substantial financial incentive for sticking around, you should have been gone yesterday. Your colleagues who are leaving are going to get the open jobs in your current market, your bosses/C-levels are going to take a nice exit bonus/parachute, and you will be sitting there jobless when it goes belly up. As some comments said, look out for yourself first, foremost, and always. This is business. If your company really needs you in this dire time, they need to make it attractive because right now, it is definitely not attractive for you. 

Don't take it personally or as an insult. It probably has nothing to do with your competence as a developer. There are certain responsibilities that are reserved for managers, team leads, and seniors; the main responsibility being access to live/production systems. Giving access to a critical system to a junior dev is most likely against company policy and overall not good practice. It is a good idea to have your code go through a more senior dev just to double check the code and make sure nothing will break. The company reduces its chances of having bad code make it into production by limiting the amount of people who have the ability to deploy it. 

You aren't going to impress anyone by being able to write a Hello World program or a loop in 20 different standard languages or eso-langs. There are a ton of people who can do that with a couple hours of work, and it really doesn't provide anything of substance to a client or an employer. Pick a few things, get really good at them, and have those be your bread and butter. Outside of those, have fun learning new stuff on the side to satisfy your need for intellectual stimulation. However, you are on the right track in a certain sense. One of the most valuable skills someone can have is being able to pick up something they know nothing about, learn how to use it, understand its pros and cons, and then communicate that information to others. Don't lose that ability and actively cultivate it. An employer would most likely rather have someone with an intermediate knowledge that can pick up new things quickly, be flexible, and learn instead of someone who is an expert in one thing and is terrible at learning anything other than their specific domain. 

Absolutely. And they can politely refuse to move forward with interviewing you if the job requires you to have the phone for after hours calls, on-call support, etc. 

This shows that there is no official documentation on how to handle it, you will gladly share with your colleagues this manager's viewpoint on having a million open conversations (which not many people will be in favor of), and the problem should go away. 

I would say this is not normal outside of a sales organization. Sales companies (for the most part)will post everyone's sales top to bottom, and yes, it is embarrassing and sucks to be on the bottom if you have a bad month. It sounds like the management prefers the transparency into what everyone is doing and how well they are doing it (even if it is inaccurate and unfair). You can either try to abolish the system by coming together with your devs and saying this is a bad way to measure performance, you can play by the rules and do what needs to be done to earn points and get a promotion, or you can look elsewhere for a better culture fit. 

If you are even slightly interested in working for the company that your internship is through, be prepared to throw a number at them if they ask what it will take to convert you to a full time employee. 

We can't answer this because we are not this person. We don't know if she is frustrated, elated, miffed, lugubrious, etc. The general rule of thumb is that "the recruiter is working for you" so you should call the shots for the most part when it comes to scheduling instead of putting it back on the recruiter. She is going to make money off you, so she will make herself available. The more you deal with recruiters, the more you will be asked for times when you are available for certain things. 

Just pull him back to the task at hand. "Hey John, that article you read sounds really cool and I want to hear more about it, but I actually have a bunch of stuff to do after we wrap up this project. Do you mind if we focus on this and we can continue our conversation once I have a little more free time?" Then go have a good lunch or happy hour once you have finished the work and chat all you want. The other thing to keep in mind is how you are being perceived by the company. If you worked for 2 hours and 40 minutes of it was non-work related chatting, chances are someone noticed that you were not working and instead just gabbing or someone is noticing that your work is taking an unacceptable amount of time. Colleagues can start to get feelings of resentment and feel that you are not a good/hard worker if you get a reputation for chatting more than working. 

Please forgive me if I am completely missing something due to not being familiar with German employment customs/standards, but this whole post makes you sounds quite entitled and arrogant. In my opinion, you are in the wrong. You are transitioning out of a role and you are responsible for handing off tasks, projects, responsibilities, and knowledge that will facilitate a smooth departure. Your supervisor asked that you share your knowledge with him (since they can't find a suitable replacement yet), and you are implying that you are above that and he is undeserving of your time and skills. If you purchased a book or online course and learned something valuable, would you be unwilling to share what you learned unless someone compensated you the cost of the book and the time it took you to read it? You were asked by your boss while you are still an employee to help them get up to speed as much as you can since they are in a bind without having a new dev lined up. You should do what you can, maintain a good attitude, let them know your concerns about how much you feel can get handed off in the time frame and what you feel they will need to continue after that time has passed, and leave on good terms. Otherwise, you risk your Zwischenzeugnis and you get a reputation for being hard to work with.
