I am searching for examples of pseudomanifolds that satisfy Poincaré duality but that are not homeomorphic to homology manifolds. I would like to know if there exist examples of complex projective varieties that satisfy these properties: satisfy poincaré duality but are not homology manifolds. Edit (Ben Wieland's example): Let $M^3$ be a manifold and let us consider $[0,1]\subset M$, glue the interval to itself by an involution $f$ that reverses the endpoints. Then we get a pseudomanifold $M'$ whose homotopy type is the same as $M$ then it satisfies Poincaré duality but it is not a homology manifold, you can look at the local homology of the equivalence class $[0]\in M'$ of $0\in [0,1]\subset M$. This is due to the fact that the link of $[0]$ in $M'$ is not connected ($M'$ is not normal). The normalization of $M'$ is $M$ itself, thus I would like to know an example where the pseudomanifold is normal. 

Let us suppose that $G$ is a Lie group. The space of maps $map(S^1,G)$ is a topological group called a loop group, maybe it is better to consider smooth loops, in that case we have an infinite dimensional Lie group. A very nice and classical reference is Pressley, Segal "Loop groups", Oxford Mathematical Monographs. From the point of view of string topology, I can say a few things: 

Now the pull-back in homology is defined by taking the geometric pull-back of $Z$ along $f$. We need to put $\psi$ and $f$ in transverse position, this can be achevied by some transversality lemmas for pseudo-manifolds. Thus when these two maps are in general position the geometric pull-back is again a pseudo-manifold and its fundamental class gives you a representative of $f^*(C)$. If you don't feel comfortable with pseudo-manifolds, then you can write your cycle as a sum of $i$-simplexes. You put these simplexes in transverse position (same transversality lemmas), the pull-back of these $i$-cycles is a sum of manifolds with corners you pick a triangulation of each of them and get the pull-back cycle as a sum of simplexes. The operation is well defined in homology. Thus pull-back in homology is truly a geometric pull-back. Let me add that there are plenty of ways to define pull-backs in homology they all rely on Poincaré duality. Maybe a nice reference is also M. Kreck's book "Differential algebraic topology" graduate studies in mathematics 110, AMS (chapter 12 and chapter 13). In this book he has a very good geometric model of homology in terms of stratifolds, its geometric definition of cohomology with its version of Poincaré duality will give you pull-back maps in homology which are exactly geometric transverse pull-backs of stratifolds. 

Let $V$ be a smooth complex projective variety, I was wondering if there exists some homotopical or topological necessary conditions for $V$ to be deformation equivalent to a variety $V_0$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$? Edit: a deformation equivalence is the equivalence relation generated by local deformations of complex manifolds. A local deformation equivalence can be defined in the following way: let $W\rightarrow B_1$ be a proper holomorphic submersion (where $B_1=\{\mid z\mid <1 \}\subset \mathbb{C}$), the complex varieties isomorphic to fibers $W_t$ ($t\in B_1$) are deformation equivalent. 

In this paper you will find examples that fits with your first question: $URL$ "Elliptic rational spaces whose cohomologies and homotopies are isomorphic" Tetsu Nishimotoa, Hiroo Shiga, Toshihiro Yamaguchi. The authors consider a family of elliptic spaces that are not formal nor coformal. These examples are very interesting, they build two simply-connected closed smooth manifolds $M_1$, $M_2$ such that 

Another solution is to consider clutching functions. The sphere $S^2$ is obtained by gluing two disks along their boundaries, it is not hard to prove that the information is encoded by a continuous map: $$f:S^1\rightarrow GL_1(\mathbb{R})$$ and that we have a map: $$[S^1,GL_1(\mathbb{R})]\rightarrow Vect^1(S^2)$$ where on the left hand side you have homotopy classes of clutching functions and on the right hand side you have isomorphism classes of real line bundles over $S^2$. As our continuous map $f$ is homotopic to a constant map the associated vector bundle is trivial. In general for $n$-dimensional real vector bundles over $S^k$ you will have a map: $$[S^{k-1},GL_n(\mathbb{R})]\rightarrow Vect^n(S^k).$$ This map becomes a bijection when you consider oriented vector bundles. edit: I just realize that I write my post at the same time as Francesco. 

As the category of smooth manifolds is a full subcategory of the category of diffeological spaces the answer is yes they are still exotic. Edit: let me add that the forgetful functor $U$ from diffeological spaces to topological spaces given by the $D$-topology has an adjoint let call it $Sm$. If you take a topological space $X$ it has a diffeology where the plots are given by all continuous maps from numerical domains to $X$. If you begin with a non-empty smooth manifold $M$ of $dim>0$ viewed as a diffeological space then you can notice that $Sm(U(M))$ are not isomorphic. This is not surprising of course. Let me also add that even if you can put plenty of diffeological structures on a topological space, actually we have no classification results nor surgery techniques available in the diffeological world. People are developping homotopy theory for diffeological spaces (Enxin Wu's Phd thesis is a very good place to look at) maybe one day these techniques will be helpful in order to understand our "classical smooth manifolds". Thus actually exotic spheres are not easier to build nor to recognize in the diffeological world. 

You can look at this volume: $URL$ ps: J.-P. Serre's papers are written in a very elegant style, his french is beautiful and nice to read :-) 

I. To my knowledge over any field this conjecture is still open. II. Over a field of characteristic zero, this conjecture is true, and we have more, we have a BV-isomorphism: Félix, Yves; Thomas, Jean-Claude "Rational BV-algebra in string topology." Bull. Soc. Math. France 136 (2008), no. 2, 311–327. 

Maybe Félix, Halperin and Thomas recent work on ranks of homotopy groups of finite $1$-connected CW-complexes can be of interest regarding your questions: "Exponential growth and an asymptotic formula for the ranks of homotopy groups of a finite 1-connected complex", Annals of Mathematics, 170 (2009), 443–464 $URL$ 

I want to give you a different answer about the group $LG=map(S^1,G)$. Let us take a $G$-bundle over $M$ (we suppose that $M$ is a smooth manifold): $G\rightarrow E\rightarrow M$, we can apply the loop functor and get a new bundle $$LG\rightarrow LE\rightarrow LM$$ this bundle is a $LG$-bundle. Many geometric properties of $M$ can be traduced as geometric properties of $LM$ (the important concept here is "transgression"). Let me give one example. If you consider a Riemmanian structure on $M$: $$SO(n)\rightarrow Fr(TM)\rightarrow M$$ it is a $SO(n)$-bundle. Then the free loop bundle $$LFr(TM)\rightarrow LM$$ is a $LSO(n)$-bundle. We can define an orientation bundle for $LM$: $$LFr(TM)\times_{LSO(n)}\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow LM.$$ An orientation of $LM$ is a section of this bundle. P. Teichner and S. Stolz have introduced a new structure on this bundle called the fusion product and they have proved that fusion preservind orientations of $LM$ are in bijection with spin structures on $M$ (preprint available on P. Teichner's homepage). You can have a look at K. Waldorf's papers: "Spin structures on loop spaces that characterize string manifolds" and "A Loop Space Formulation for Geometric Lifting Problems". There is a huge litterature on that subject that involves among other things loop groups, non-abelian cohomology, higher geometric objects like gerbes. A good starting point in this subject could be J.-L. Brylinski's book "Loop spaces, characteristic classes and geometric quantization". 

Let $X$ be a topological space, and let $A^*(X)$ be its CDGA of polynomial forms. As we work over a field you can produce a quasi-isomorphism (it is a chain homotopy equivalence): $$p:A^*(X)\rightarrow H^*(X,\mathbb{Q})$$ and transfer the commutative product from $A^*(X)$ to $H^*(X,\mathbb{Q})$. Then you a get a $C_{\infty}$-structure on the cohomology. As Mark writes, citing Kadesihvili, this determines the rational homotopy type of the space at least when $X$ is simply-connected and of finite type. Just a few comments on this structure: 1) if you want to do some computations at some point you will need to have natural algebraic structures, a priori this transfer depends on choices. This transfered structure is not natural. 2) of course cohomology seems smaller and this statement is cool. But you will pay a price for this "smallness" in the complexity of the $C_{\infty}$-structure. And this is can be expensive. 3) You really need all Massey products, you can produce a lot of very funny examples playing with complement of links. 4) Dev Sinha and Ben Walter have two very nice papers on "Lie coalgebras and rational homotopy theory", the second one on Hopf invariants is related to my third remark. They explain how rational homotopy groups are related to higher linking numbers.
