Those are my two main points, to help me prove to you that gravity travels at the speed of light. Also, light is not the only thing in the universe which travels at the speed of light. It is about all massless particles! Photons and gluons are two good examples I can think of of massless particles, I'm not sure about gravitons though - but I'll still include them. 

This diagram can show us many things, for example, how black holes don't have a gravitational pull which goes across the whole universe. On a final note, we can work out the area where even light cannot escape by using the Schwarzschild radius. Seen as you said this answer shouldn't include relativity, I won't include any maths either. The Schwarzschild radius, in summary, is where the event horizon is in a black hole. Summary Sorry for providing a awkwardly long answer, I was having trouble understanding what you didn't understand, and I thought that if I explained a singularity - then I'd surely help you, sorry if I've just said things you already know. I've provided some Wikipedia links if you want to have a look at some of the terms I left in italics. You might also want to look at black hole thermodynamics 

Have we detected continuum optical emission from any rotating neutron stars that do not have an accretion disk dominating the light? I ask because I know we have observed Doppler broadening of spectral lines from the rotation of even ordinary stars rotating at ordinary rates, but it seems to me that only the rapid rotation of a neutron star would be fast enough to make the Doppler broadening of the thermal continuum peak to be observable. 

You can probably extract the data from Stellarium. Also, does it need to be all sky, or not? What Wavelength? If you want an all sky visible catalogue, the United States Navy produced the NOMAD catalog by combining 2MASS, UCAC, and the USNO-B catalog. You could also use the APASS all sky catalog, meant for helping astronomers with photometric calibration. If you don't care about whether the wavelength is in the visible, CalTech's IRSA has a bunch of infrared source catalogs (the smallest/shallowest one being the IRAS catalog). The deepest all sky infrared catalogs are the WISE sets. Other good databases to dig in to include the Hipparcos set of parallaxes, or some part of the Gaia catalog. 

The following is a plausibility argument based on the symmetry of an assumed circular orbit of the earth around the sun. The earth's rotational axis is inclined to the ecliptic plane by an angle of about 23.4째. For this reason idealized tidal bulges induced by the sun would travel around the earth's equator at the vernal and autumnal equinox whereas they would travel around circles of 23.4째 northern and southern longitude at summer and winter solstice. For symmetry reasons the tidal effects induced by the sun must have either a maximum or a minimum at the equinoxes. From this we conclude that also the combined tidal effects of sun and moon have either a maximum or a minimum at the equinoxes (on average). Given the higher proportion of land to water at 23째 northern latitude and a similar proportion at 23째 southern latitude compared to the equator, it seems reasonable to assume a maximum at the equinoxes. 

What is a singularity? A singularity is a point in the universe where matter is infinitely dense. The singularity is at the centre of the black hole, and is often hiding behind an event horizon. So basically, a singularity is a point in space where a lot of matter is squeezed together in a very small space. When you have a singularity matter does not go to infinity. Density is what goes to infinity. Density and matter are different things. A singularity is often created in a supernova explosion. A supernova is where a star is caused when there is so much matter in the centre of a star (at the end of its life) that the star cannot support its own gravitational force, and it collapses in on itself and explodes. The second way a supernova can happen is in a binary star system - where if there is a white dwarf, it steals matter from the other star and eventually it accumulates so much matter that it explodes. A singularity is caused by the big stars, not small ones. Small stars that explode in a supernova create something called neutron stars. So what is a black hole? A black hole is a area in space with a gravitational field so strong not even light can escape. Black holes don't have the colour black, they don't have a colour because we can't see any light coming back from them. So no, light is not absorbed. Black holes can also eventually dissipate, due to a mechanism called Hawking Radiation There are multiple types of black holes including: 

One of the tools being developed for the study of exoplanets is called transmission spectroscopy - basically looking at how passing through the exoplanet's atmosphere changes the spectrum of the star. The problem, though, is that spectroscopy is hard, and requires a big telescope, probably space-based. This makes the process slow. It seems that it would be very useful if we would triage the data using broad-band photometry to more quickly limit the presence of compounds like water, $\mathrm{CO}_2$, and $\mathrm{O}_3$. Looking at a plot of Earth's atmospheric transmission, with a breakdown by chemical compound, it seems like looking at the color of the transit depths in and between the windows in the wavelength range from 1 to 20 microns, might provide a plausible alternative to quickly get information on the atmospheres of planets and brown dwarf stars. For the exoplanets, specifically, the wavelengths blocked by an atmosphere make the planet, effectively, bigger at some wavelengths than at others, depending on the opacity at that wavelength, the thickness (density) of the atmosphere, and vertical extent of it. The question is: is this practical? Specifically, with a 1 to 2 meter class space telescope that simultaneously images in 2 to 8 filters? 

Given a distance of $d_1 = 640~\mathrm{ly}$ for Betelgeuze and $d_2 = 8.6~\mathrm{ly}$ for Sirius the difference in the apparent magnitude for Betelgeuze at distances $d_1$ and $d_2$ that is given by $$m_1 - m_2 = 5~\mathrm{mag} \cdot log_{10}(\frac{d_1}{d_2})$$ is $9.4~\mathrm{mag}$. With magnitude $m_1 = 0.45~\mathrm{mag}$ we get $m_2 = -8.9~\mathrm{mag}$ for Betelgeuze at the distance of Sirius. This is about $860$ times brighter than Sirius ($-1.46~\mathrm{mag}$). It would be visible during daytime 

Nobody knows it. 55 km depth is probably between crust and mantle, with estimated temperatures well above 500 K. 

The maximum possible radius of a planet is probably unknown to date because current observation techniques not only will give us a biased view of the distribution of planet radii but it is also difficult to tell planets and brown dwarfs apart. However current data suggest a limit of roughly 2 Jupiter radii. 

This can be done by high-contrast imaging. Currently it is only feasible for a very limited class of systems (e.g. HR 8799) since it is difficult to achieve the required angular resolution (0.1 arcsecs for exoplanets at a distance 10 parsec) with today's adaptive optics. Future large telescopes such as the European Extremely Large Telescope are designed for direct imaging as well as visible and near-infrared spectroscopy of exoplanets.
