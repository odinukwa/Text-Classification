Any relative movement between speaker and listener would have to be carefully compensated for, since increased distance would change the volume Sound is usually somewhat focused; turning your head (or sound generation organ) slightly to the side would change the volume, and therefore the meaning of your statement Any conversation would have to begin with an exchange of volume calibration noises, and if one got distracted in the middle, non-verbal communication would have to be used to reset the calibration, making extended conversations difficult Changes in ambient noise can affect the conversants unequally, leading to loss of calibration even in the best situations 

In humans, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't, for the reasons listed at the end of this answer. In other creatures, though, perhaps if the ear simply senses the energy of the sound waves reaching it, and reports that as a fluctuating signal. There would likely need to be multiple "ears", that trap sound from various directions, since it would be impossible to have more than one person talking at once without being able to have the brain focus in on one voice; the overlapping volumes would change the meaning of the speech. The more ears they have, the better the brain would be able to process the input and focus in on individual voices. Perhaps a series of several pits around their head, each one of which senses the relative energy of the sound waves reaching it. Even then, they would be much more likely to develop a language based on timed pulses, ala Morse code. For the creatures to not develop this, they would have to have a limitation in their ability to sense passage of time. The time sense of these creatures would have to fluctuate wildly, to the point that they would be unable to reliably tell the difference between a dot and a dash. Perhaps their brains are sort of like modern computer processors, which change processing speed from moment to moment as needed, slowing down to conserve energy, and speeding up when decisions need to be made; with the sense of the flow of time adjusting accordingly. With these limitations, it would rule out the language being based on a constant sound with modulated volume; it would need to be repeated bursts of sound with each burst being at a constant volume throughout, since timing can't be considered. It might take the form of some sort of barking sound, with the barks varying in volume. A conversation might be begun by an individual "barking" a few times to set the initial volume of the conversation. If the other individual wishes to speak (or loses track of the conversation) they might break in in the same way, and wait for the other to make a statement relinquishing control of the conversation before saying their piece. You are correct that relative volume would be necessary. That could be in one of two manners: volume relative to the previous sound burst, or relative to the initial calibrated volume. Making it relative to the previous burst would require recalibration if the speaker reached the top of their vocal range. One way to do this is being limited to three phonemes (quiter, same, and louder) so that after a long series of louder phonemes one could modulate very far down in volume in one step without changing the meaning. Still, very significant hurdles would need to be overcome: 

In a Rocheworld scenario where two planets are tidally locked and share an atmosphere, but where both the planets are so small that their gravity is very little (as low as one of the dwarf planets in our solar system, such as Ceres, for example), is it possible for creatures that can fly to go back and forth between the planets via the shared atmosphere? Handwave the existence of a breathable, dense Earth like atmosphere of course. Could a humanoid character fly from one of the planets to the other through that area of shared atmosphere if he/she had wings (again, handwave), or one of those flying squirrel suits with something like a Buck Rogers rocket jet pack? The way I understand it is that: They’d need enough lift to get off the ground (this place has low gravity and they’d have their wings or jet pack), and they’d have to be able to push further than the Lagrange points because if not they'd be stuck in orbit (but again, wings/jetpack, right?). So is it possible, or am I missing something else? 

The drug is incredibly hard to find in nature and every attempt to artificially manufacture it has failed. Why is it so hard to find? The fungus it comes from only lives for a certain time, in small patches, and then dies off. It takes so much energy from the soil that it basically kills of the surrounding area, and then itself. The area comes back to life over time, and the fungus comes back to life in other areas because its spores hibernate and awaken elsewhere. But it could be anywhere so there's no way to predict exactly where. When it does reappear there's a mad scramble to get as much of it as possible, and when it dies off the drug becomes a highly expensive commodity, making it quite rare. As for growing it in a controlled environment, well, attempts have been made, but the darned thing always dies off. Some agricultural scientists are starting to posit the view that the fungus itself may "know" when it's time to move on. Crazy, I know, but then again this is a sci-fi/fantasy story. 

I imagine a society filled with Ender Wiggins. In some respects, we should expect it to look a lot like our society right now. There would still be Taylor Swifts and Kanye Wests, but their fans would not be fanatical. They would be the moms and dads of today's concerts, rather than the screaming teenagers, and they might go to concerts as much out of a sense of irony as any particular love of the music. There would be political parties, but the parties would appeal to the highest thinkers rather than the lowest. Instead of just promising to give away stuff to the masses, they would try to claim that their vision of the future is the most accurate, and extends the furthest. The debate would not be about whether climate change is anthropogenic, but rather which allocation of resources most appropriately deals with the near and far-term future. Credibility would be based on analysis and information-gathering, rather than pandering. If actual fanatics existed at all, they would do so as a higher-order tactic to achieve an obscured goal. Every major action would have a double-, triple-, quadruple-meaning and intent. The world would be a giant game of chess. If someone committed an act of terror, it would cause real terror, not because it is random, but because everyone would know that it is carefully calculated, and you either understand the cause (and can avoid a similar fate), or you don't (and you are already behind the curve). Some people would still choose to be homeless or vagrants or hippies, but probably very few would be low-wage workers, because they would realize in school that the path which leads to drudge work does not optimize personal happiness (in the future...of course, it usually is the result of consuming all the happiness in the present). On the one hand, cooperation would be maximized, because there are many situations in which it is rationally optimal but not chosen because of irrationality. On the other hand, this would make more appealing targets for high-functioning sociopaths, who are necessarily rational and open-minded (because ultimately, cooperation requires trust, and trust is the primary currency of sociopaths). I would guess that this world would be both more exciting and more terrifying. Human value systems would likely change more quickly, and we might view this society as barbaric in some respects. They might decide that eating dead people is perfectly acceptable and a good way to recycle resources. It might look like an extreme form of libertarianism. In many respects, it may look like a lot of cyberpunk societies. 

Piggybacking on this question: Could soft matter infused with nano or pico sized magnets be used to clump together so that we could create environments with it? ...So we have a planet that has lower gravity than Earth, low enough for people to float/fly in the sky (so it does have an atmosphere- like Earths), with an ocean that is held together with the use of nano-magnets evenly spread throughout (the ocean covers the planet). But how do we keep the place from evaporating into space or freezing over? I think that the atmosphere itself will keep it from evaporating, and I think that having it close to the sun will keep it warm so it doesn't freeze (the planet could be somewhere a bit farther out than Earth is to our sun, but not as far as Mars, or maybe it needs to be closer?). This planet is artificial so we can literally build it anywhere to achieve our results. I like to believe that its placement in the solar system (again assuming a sun like ours) solves the problem, but I might be missing other aspects. I also accept that the place is probably not stable, but I'm hoping for a scenario that could give us maybe a million years or so before falling apart. 

Consider another angle... Assuming you have a VR that somehow can transfer REAL damage and pain to you (electric shocks would be my vote) I dont see why you would you want to play in it (outside of sex of course, which I'm sure will one day be a market; but I digress...). Unless... A) what if you've been forced against your will in gladiator style VR arena? B) what if its a contest for big prize money? C) what if an evil programmer traps you in the VR? D) what if they're high tech adrenaline junkies? My point is, create an interface with the player that transfers pain/damage to them (electrodes, whatever...). Your audience will accept it. WHY your characters are submitting (or not) themselves to said lethal damage is more important. 

The only idea I haven't seen mentioned is the flying aircraft carrier. Imagine the dragon lifting a few soldiers with gliders strapped to their backs. At altitude, it releases the archers and they rain death from above. The archers may need to be in 2-man gliders with a pilot/bomber and archer. If the dragon(s) could release the gliders from behind enemy lines, they could cause a lot of havoc, but with the disadvantage that they have to land behind enemy lines or fly over the lines to reach friendly ground. Even dropped from friendly airspace, the gliders would have the benefit of gravity and elevation while shooting/bombing. In this mode, the dragon becomes a glorified elevator which substitutes for a nearby hill/mountain (which may not be present at the battlefield). If each dragon only had a few gliders to worry about, it could release them at high altitude (where they could start with bombing), let them glide down to some flight floor (where they can snipe with bows), and then pick them up again in mid-air, to bring them back up to the flight ceiling. In between, it could strafe enemy lines and do its normal dragon-thing. The gliders would be a force multiplier for the dragon's flying ability, to potentially devastating effect. In the same way, dragons could act as long-range siege artillery by lifting battering rams made out of giant logs and stubby glider wings (and, of course, an iron ram head). Since dragons are not necessarily experts at ballistics and aerodynamics, you would ideally want the ram to be guided on the way down (so the dragon can drop it from very high and far away, which provides both safety to the dragon and lots of kinetic energy for a big boom). Some elite pilots could ride the ram down, using basic flight controls, and jump off at the last minute, deploying their personal gliders for a safe landing. If you drop it from high enough, a battering ram will have enough energy to blow through not just the main gate, but pretty much any reinforced structure made of stone, so you could blow a hole through any large part of the outer wall that is easy to aim at. Of course, you still have to deal with the moat, but you don't need a roof on the ram to defend against elevated attacks. Also, the ram should be moving fast enough close to impact that it is nearly impossible to hit with arrows, so the pilots should be mostly safe (except for the fact that they are riding an inert missile!).
