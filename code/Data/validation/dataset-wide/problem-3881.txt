In the paper mentioned above, on page 19, the physics of A-type supersymmetry is related to a Lagrangian submanifold $\gamma$ of a Kaehler manifold $X$. In particular, the phrase "...holomorphic components of normal and tangent of $\gamma$..." is used. What does one mean by the holomorphic component of a tangent vector of a Lagrangian submanifold? A Lagrangian submanifold does not necessarily have complex structure, and does not even need to be even-dimensional, so how can a tangent vector of the Lagrangian submanifold have a holomorphic component? 

Let $X$ be a hyperkaehler manifold. Being hyperkaehler, it has three distinguished Kaehler forms, $\omega^u$ ($u$=1,2,3), corresponding to its three distinguished almost complex structures. How does one describe a submanifold, $S$, of $X$ which is 'Lagrangian' with respect to all three Kaehler forms, i.e., $$\omega^u(T_1,T_2)=0$$ where $T^1$ and $T^2$ are arbitrary tangent vectors of $S$, and $$ \omega^u(N_1,N_2)=0 $$ where $N^1$ and $N^2$ are arbitrary normal vectors of $S$. Is it a middle-dimensional submanifold? 

I am trying to understand how to obtain the Picard group for general toric varieties. So far, I have been using information found in $URL$ . Here, a toric variety has homogeneous coordinates $H:=\{x_i : i=1,\ldots, I\}$ equipped with a number $R$ of equivalence relations $$ (x_1,\dots,x_I)\sim (\lambda_r^{Q^{(r)}_1} x_1, \ldots, \lambda_r^{Q^{(r)}_I} x_I), \\ $$ for $r=1,\dots, R$ with the weights $Q^{(r)}_i\in \mathbb Z$ and $\lambda_r\in \mathbb{C}^* = \mathbb{C}-\{0\}$. They go on to say (above equation (7)) that for each divisor $D_i$ of a toric variety, there is a line bundle $$\tag{7} L_i={\cal O}_X \bigl(Q^{(1)}_i, \ldots, Q^{(R)}_i \bigr)\; . $$ It is not clear to me why the weights $Q^{(r)}_i\in \mathbb Z$ govern the classification of line bundles, but this seems to imply that for a particular toric variety, $X$, the Picard group is $$ Pic(X)=\mathbb{Z}^R. $$ However, I have also read here -Reference for Weighted Projective Stacks - that for weighted projective spaces, the Picard group is cyclic. (Edit: It seems that this link talks about weighted projective stacks, which are not toric varieties.) What is the rationale for describing line bundles in terms of weights as in equation (7), and how does one find the Picard group of a toric variety in general? Edit: Fred Rohrer suggested in the comments that I look at Ewald's Combinatorial Complexity and Algebraic Geometry. On page 273 we find that for an arbitrary $n$-dimensional toric variety, $Pic(X)=\mathbb{Z}^{k-n-\lambda}$, $k$ being the number of 1-cones of the corresponding fan $\Sigma$, $\lambda$ being the total dimension of the spaces of linear dependencies of generators of all maximal cones which are not simplex cones. This, however, translates to $$Pic(X)=\mathbb{Z}^{R-\lambda},$$ which is different from the expression above. Why is there this discrepancy? 

A Kaehler Hamiltonian G-manifold is a Kaehler manifold with a Hamiltonian G-action, i.e., a G-action generated by a moment map. In particular, the Killing vector fields which generate the G-action are either holomorphic or antiholomorphic. What is the general explicit expression of this moment map? References would be appreciated. 

I understand that the Euler characteristic of Khovanov homology is the Jones polynomial. But in what sense does this give category theory structure to the Jones polynomial, i.e., what are the objects and morphisms? 

In Appendix A of Hyperinstantons, the Beltrami Equation, and Triholomorphic Maps by Fre et al., it is described how holomorphic maps from a Riemann surface to a hyperkahler manifold $\mathcal{N}$, can be understood as triholomorphic maps (also known as hyperinstantons) from a hyperkahler 4-manifold $\mathcal{M}_4$ to $\mathcal{N}$. In particular, it was shown (c.f. equations A.10 and A.11) that these triholomorphic maps take the form \begin{eqnarray} % \nonumber to remove numbering (before each equation) \partial_{\bar{\alpha}} \, q^i &=& 0 \label{holomorfo} \tag{A.10}\\ \partial_\alpha \, q^i &=& \, - \,{\rm i} \, \frac{1}{2} \, \epsilon_{\alpha}^{\phantom{\alpha}\bar{\beta}}\, \partial_{\bar{\beta}} \, \bar{q}^{\bar{\ell}} \, \bar{\Omega}_{\bar{\ell}}^{\phantom{\ell}i} \tag{A.11} \label{triholomorfo} \end{eqnarray} plus the complex conjugates of the above. The first equation says that $q^i$ is holomorphic w.r.t. the two complex coordinates of $\mathcal{M}_4$. The second constraint relates the holomorphic derivatives of the holomorphic coordinates of $\mathcal{N}$ to the anti-holomorphic derivatives of the anti-holomorphic coordinates of $\mathcal{N}$ through the unique $Ω^{(2,0)}$ form of $\mathcal{N}$. It is then claimed that if $q^i$ depends holomorphically only on ONE of the two coordinates of the base manifold, then the triholomorphicity conditions above are automatically satisfied. I can see this for A.10, but how is this true for A.11? 

In this question - On a Hirzebruch surface. , the Hirzebruch surface is shown to be isomorphic to a hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^2$. My question is, does such an isomorphism exist for all toric varieties (or at least simplicial ones)? To be precise, given a toric variety $$ (\mathbb{C}^N \backslash U)/(\mathbb{C}^*)^m, $$ can we show that it is isomorphic to a hypersurface of a product of $m$ projective spaces? At least for complete intersection Calabi-Yaus, this seems to be true, based on $URL$ 

In the question titled "Line bundles and vector bundles on $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1$" it was explained how any holomorphic line bundle on $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1$ is of the form $\mathcal O(m,n) = p_1^*(\mathcal O(m)) \otimes p_2^*(\mathcal O(n))$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ denote the projections on the two factors. In addition, in "Monad Bundles in Heterotic String Compactifications", it is explained in Section 3.1 that for a complete intersection Calabi-Yau (CICY) (defined as an intersection of zero loci of polynomials in an ambient space, which is a product of $m$ projective spaces $\mathbb{P}^{n_i}$), denoted $X$, its holomorphic line bundles $\mathcal{O}_X(k^1,\ldots,k^m)$ can be obtained by restricting $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{n_1}}(k^1)\otimes\ldots\otimes\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{n_m}}(k^m)$ to $X$. I would like to know how to generalize the above to holomorphic line bundles on an arbitrary simplicial toric variety. Is it possible to show that a holomorphic line bundle on a simplicial toric variety $$ X=(\mathbb{C}^N \backslash U)/(\mathbb{C}^*)^m, $$ denoted $\mathcal{O}_X(k^1,\ldots,k^m)$, is equal to the restriction of a holomorphic line bundle of the form $$ \mathcal O_{X_1}(k^1) \otimes \mathcal O_{X_2}(k^2)\otimes\dots\otimes \mathcal O_{X_m}(k^m) $$ to $X$, where $X$ can be defined as an intersection of zero loci of polynomials in the ambient space $X_1\times X_2\ldots \times X_m$? All the $X_i$ here are spaces which have Picard number equal to 1. 

This is a continuation of this question. As explained in the comments, for a hyperkaehler manifold $X$, a multi-isotropic submanifold $S$ has the property that the three distinguished Kahler forms $\omega^u$ of $X$ vanish when pulled back to $S$, i.e., $$\omega^u(T_1,T_2)=0$$ for tangent vectors $T_1,T_2$ of $S$. My question is, can such a multi-isotropic submanifold $S$ be found such that $S$ itself is hyperkaehler? The maximum dimension for $S$ (when $X$ is 4k-dimensional) is $k$. Perhaps it could be shown that for a hyperkaehler manifold $\tilde{S}$, the space $T^*\tilde{S}\times T^*\tilde{S}$ is hyperkaehler, for which $\tilde{S}$ is a multi-isotropic submanifold? 

Let $X$ be a manifold with a left $G$-action, and let $\Sigma$ be a Riemann surface. How is the equivariant cohomology $H^*_G(X)$ of $X$ related to the de Rham cohomology of the associated bundle $H^*(P\times_GX)$, where $P$ is a $G$-bundle over $\Sigma$? The following is my attempt at a solution. We know that $H^*_G(X)=H^*(EG\times_GX)$, where $EG\rightarrow BG$ is the universal or platonic $G$-bundle, with the base space $BG$ (the classifying space). Also, any $G$-bundle is a pullback of $EG$, e.g., given a map $f:\Sigma \rightarrow BG$, we have \begin{equation} P= f^*EG \end{equation} for a $G$-bundle $P\rightarrow\Sigma$. Therefore, we find that $H^*(P\times_GX)= H^*(f^*EG\times_GX)$. If $H^*(f^*EG\times_GX) = f^*H^*(EG\times_GX)$, then we have \begin{equation} H^*(P\times_GX)= f^*H^*_G(X). \end{equation} But is it true that $H^*(f^*EG\times_GX) = f^*H^*(EG\times_GX)$? References would be appreciated. 

In $URL$ on page 60 and 61, it is mentioned that the connection of $\mathcal{O}(-n)$ over a (simplicial) toric variety of the form $$ (\mathbb{C}^N \backslash U)/(\mathbb{C}^*) $$ is $$ A= -n{i\over 2}{\displaystyle~\sum \!{}_{i=1}^N (\overline{\phi}_i{d} \phi_i-{d}\overline{\phi}_i \phi_i)~\over \displaystyle \sum \!{}_{i=1}^NQ_i|\phi_i|^2}, $$ in terms of complex homogeneous coordinates $(\phi_i,\overline{\phi}_i)$ which obey the equivalence relation $$ (\phi_1,\dots,\phi_N)\sim (\lambda^{Q_1} \phi_1, \ldots, \lambda^{Q_N} \phi_N), \\ $$ with the weights $Q_i\in \mathbb Z$ and $\lambda\in \mathbb{C}^* = \mathbb{C}-\{0\}$. My question is, how does the connection generalize to the case of a general (simplicial) toric variety $$ (\mathbb{C}^N \backslash U)/(\mathbb{C}^*)^m, $$ which contains a set of homogeneous coordinates $(\phi_i,\overline{\phi}_i)$ equipped with a number $m$ of equivalence relations $$ (\phi_1,\dots,\phi_N)\sim (\lambda_r^{Q^{(r)}_1} \phi_1, \ldots, \lambda_r^{Q^{(r)}_N} \phi_N), \\ $$ for $r=1,\dots, m$ with the weights $Q^{(r)}_i\in \mathbb Z$ and $\lambda_r\in \mathbb{C}^* = \mathbb{C}-\{0\}$? Since the Picard group for a general simplicial toric variety is $\mathbb{Z}^{N-m}$, an arbitrary line bundle on such a variety is of the form $\mathcal{O}(k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{N-m})$, so I believe the connection should be expressible in terms of the integers $k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_{N-m}$. 

I am looking for an example of a hyperkaehler manifold $Y$ whose mirror is the total space of a tangent bundle $TX$ or a cotangent bundle $T^*X$, where $X$ can be any Riemannian manifold. Is such a pair known to exist? I should add that I am not interested in mirrors which are Landau-Ginzburg (LG) pairs which include (the total spaces of) $TX$ or $T^*X$ together with an LG superpotential, but instead just a mirror manifold with no other data. 

Is the mirror of a hyperkaehler manifold always a hyperkaehler manifold? What I know so far is as follows: In this paper ($URL$ by Verbitsky, it is claimed that every hyperkaehler manifold is mirror to itself (which would meant the answer to my question is 'yes'). On the other hand, from the answer to this question - Mirror symmetry for hyperkahler manifold , it seems that this is not always the case, i.e., a K3 surface can have a nontrivial mirror. 

What is the difference between the Fukaya category and the Fukaya-Floer category? It seems that the former is defined in terms of flat $U(1)$ line bundles and the latter in terms of flat unitary vector bundles. However, in some references, it seems that Fukaya category is used for objects which include flat unitary vector bundles as well. 

The de Rham cohomology of the associated bundle $H^∗(P×_GX)$ is indeed the pullback of the equivariant cohomology $H^∗_G(X)$. See the commutative diagram (2.10) in 'Equivariant Cohomology and Gauged Bosonic $\sigma$-models' by Figueora-O'Farrill and Stanciu ($URL$ 

This is essentially a follow-up question from 'Is the mirror of a hyperkaehler manifold always a hyperkaehler manifold?'. Verbitsky's theorem in ($URL$ says that certain compact hyperkaehler manifolds are their own mirrors. What about noncompact hyperkaehler manifolds? Are the mirrors of noncompact hyperkaehler manifolds also hyperkaehler? Are there at least some examples where this is true? I think at least for noncompact K3 manifolds, this should be known. In particular, I am interested in noncompact hyperkaehler manifolds which are cotangent bundles. For example, the cotangent bundles of hermitian symmetric spaces are hyperkaehler, as discussed in 'Is the cotangent bundle to a Kahler manifold hyperkahler?' 

How does one know in general that the toric fibers of a Kahler toric manifold are Lagrangian submanifolds? I can roughly fathom this for e.g. a circle in $\mathbb{C}P^1$, but how about more general toric manifolds of higher dimension? 

I seem to find a disparity by a factor of 2 in some results where the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem is used. I am particularly troubled by the following example; in $URL$ (page 10) it is shown that the index of a particular Cauchy-Riemann operator is \begin{equation} \textrm{index} (\phi^{\ast}\nabla^A)^{0,1} = \langle c^G_1(TX),\phi_*(\Sigma)\rangle + (\textrm {dim}_\mathbb{C} X)(1-g). \end{equation} However, in the related paper $URL$ (page 28), the index for this operator is given as \begin{equation} \textrm{index} (\phi^{\ast}\nabla^A)^{0,1} = 2\langle c^G_1(TX),\phi_*(\Sigma)\rangle + (\textrm {dim}_\mathbb{C} X)(2-2g). \end{equation} Why is there an additional factor of 2 in the second expression? Is it a case of different conventions, or are the operators in the two references actually different? 

In order for the quaternionic structure on a hyperkahler manifold to take the canonical form $$ J_1= \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{array}\right] $$ $$ J_2= \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right] $$ $$ J_3= \left[\begin{array}{cccc} 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right] $$ in a local patch, the overlap maps between coordinate charts ought to satisfy the Cauchy-Fueter equations, i.e., they ought to be affine. Besides tori, what hyperkaehler manifolds admit an atlas with affine overlap maps, and therefore admit quaternionic structure with the canonical form written above? 

The sections of the holomorphic line bundle $\mathcal{O}(n)$ are acted on by the covariant derivative $$ d+nA, $$ where $A$ is the connection on the $U(1)$ bundle to which $\mathcal{O}(n)$ is associated. My question is, are there holomorphic line bundles associated to $U(1)^M$ bundles, where $M$ is some integer? The sections of such a holomorphic line bundle would be acted on by the covariant derivative $$ d+\sum_b^M n_b A_b, $$ where $n_b$ denotes the representation w.r.t. each $U(1)$ factor. It would be natural to denote such a line bundle as $\mathcal{O}(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_b)$. Do such holomorphic line bundles exist in the mathematical literature? References would be highly appreciated. Edit: To be more precise, I am interested in the holomorphic line bundles described in the previous paragraph defined over toric manifolds $X=(\mathbb{C}^N-\mathcal{P})/({\mathbb{C}^{\times}})^k$, especially the case where $k>1$. (Here $\mathcal{P}$ denotes a subset of $\mathbb{C}^N$ fixed under a continuous subgroup of $({\mathbb{C}^{\times}})^k$.) In particular, I would like to understand the generalization of the line bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$ which are denoted as $\mathcal{O}(m,n)$, mentioned in Line bundles and vector bundles on $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1$. There, it is explained in the comments that $\mathcal{O}(m,n)= p_1^*\mathcal{O}(m)\otimes p_2^*\mathcal{O}(n)$, where $p_1$ and $p_2$ denote the projections onto the two factors. 

In the paper Supersymmetric Boundary Conditions in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory by Gaiotto and Witten, an in-depth analysis of boundary conditions in N=4 Super Yang-Mills in four dimensions in performed. My main interest is the set of operators given in equation (2.7). It is claimed that the action of $W=SO(1,2)\times SO(3)\times SO(3)$ commutes with the operators $$ B_0=\Gamma_{456789}\\B_1=\Gamma_{3456}\\B_2=\Gamma_{3789}, $$ (where the subscripts on right-hand-sides indicate completely antisymmetrized products of 10D gamma matrices. Note that $SO(1,2)$ acts on the indices $012$, and the two $SO(3)$ groups act on $456$ and $789$ respectively.) How does one prove that this is true? 

In the Mirror Symmetry monograph ($URL$ on page 297, the index theorem is used for a two-dimensional twisted Dirac operator. Below equation 13.37, it is claimed that the number of $\psi_-$ zero modes is equal to the number of $\overline{\psi}_+$ zero modes, and the number of $\overline{\psi}_-$ zero modes is equal to the number of ${\psi}_+$ zero modes. How does one show that this is true? In addition, on page 811, a similar problem is considered for a two-dimensional surface with boundary. Here it is claimed in equation 39.213 that the index of the twisted Dirac operator is \begin{equation} \textrm{Index }\mathcal{D}=\#[(\psi_-,\overline{\psi}_+)\textrm{ zero modes}]-\#[(\overline{\psi}_-,{\psi}_+)\textrm{ zero modes}]. \end{equation} However, as far as I understand there is no well-defined index for $\mathcal{D}$, but only well-defined indices for its chiral or antichiral parts $D$ and $\overline{D}$, where \begin{equation} \mathcal{D}=\bigg(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & D \\ \overline{D} & 0 \\ \end{array} \bigg). \end{equation} What exactly does equation 39.213 mean? Would it be correct to interpret $\textrm{Index }\mathcal{D}$ as $\textrm{Index }\overline{D}$?
