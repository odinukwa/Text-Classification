In a nutshell, the Anselm Ontological Argument states that given a God defined as "a being than which none greater can be imagined" it follows that this God must exist. It seems to me that this argument can easily fall apart with the following reasoning: Irrespective of the exact meaning of the adjective “greater”, there will be many properties contributing to being greater and other properties that are not related. For instance, being beautiful, being strong and having the power to blow up planets could be all properties contributing to being greater, therefore God would be the most beautiful, the strongest and would have the power to destroy planets. On the opposite side, being funny or being black haired are not properties that make any difference for being greater (this depends on the definition of greater of course, but given a definition there will always be properties that are not related). Now, “existing in reality” is a property that an entity can have or not have. There are two possibilities, either “existing in reality” is a property contributing to being greater or it’s not. If not, then there is no implication greater —> “existing in reality”. If yes, then the argument is circular, since we postulated what we wanted to prove. Are there any flaws in this reasoning? 

Here I will focus on a generic vision of God as "superior entity", without particular reference to any specific religion or property (for instance the fact that it has created everything, that is ageless, and so on). The tricky part with the concept of God is that is something lying beyond what we can perceive, by definition. If you could completely understand him, you would be on the same level as him (or her, or its!). A strategy could be the one of thinking something concrete as a reference and comparing where God is on this scale, and repeat this process many times. For instance I might not be able to understand how "smart" God is, but I might take as a reference the smartest person that I know and say: God is smarter than that. This situation is similar to the trouble in understanding the concept of infinity in mathematics. How big is infinity? You cannot really understand it, since you are a finite being, but you think about a very huge number and point out that infinity is bigger than that. 

Anti-capitalisms (two main types, with many sub-types) 1. A Normative Critique The main line here is that capitalism is unjust and causes us to detract from the good life. There is substantial trove of academic debate on whether Marx himself thought capitalism was unjust. (c.f. Norman Geras, "The Controversy about Marx and Justice). The most common type of this critique is - capitalism leads to inequality in resources. Some people may regard this as intrinsically negative, which is up for debate. But this inequality typically translates into unequal political influence - which we see in the form of corporate lobbyists and other distortions to the democratic process. Some other normative critiques (nowhere near exhaustive): Capitalism is exploitative - maximising profit involves underpaying workers and denying them the fair share of the revenues. Capitalism is coercive - while people may seem to voluntarily enter into labour contracts, the reality is that they have very little other option. Back in the day when peasants had some land - they could get by on subsistence farming. The modern-day proletarian has no such option. Notice that it is not an issue of whether the proletarian (working-class man) is better off or not, it is an issue of whether he is free to choose or not. Capitalism is alienating - it prevents us from working in the right sort of way, that which actualises our potential. We are stuck doing pointless jobs - like waiting fast food tables, when simple etiquette would do without it, or shuffling papers within an engorged bureaucracy, telemarketing, or roadsweeping, when machines can do it so much better. Because what maximises profit doesn't necessarily coincide with what develops our potential, there is a problem. Capitalism also alienates us from our fellow man - we see each other as potential consumers, or labour, which prevents us from relating in a dignity-preserving way. 2. An Efficiency Critique Capitalism is inefficient, and squanders our natural resources. In the Marxian lingo you would hear about capitalism being 'a fetter on the productive forces' at some point in future (1859 Preface to a Critique of Political Economy). The idea is that the productive forces (labour, machinery, natural resources...) have a tendency to develop, and the relations of production we choose have a bearing on how effectively the productive forces can develop. Capitalism has unleashed great productivity, but those who subscribe to a Marxian view of history are pessimistic about whether it will always be conducive to the development of the productive forces. From the Greens (environmentalists) you might hear about how capitalism takes a myopic view and systematically disregards environmental externalities. When selfish interests dominate government policy-making on the environment, there is wanton environmental degradation in the service of profit. This is often brought across in ethical terms - but considerations of natural resource scarcity lead me to consider it an efficiency-based critique, at least in part. Hope this helps! 

Moreover, he calls the belief, held by philosophers like Quine, that the Problem is not really a problem, and that it is a fact that does not require further explanation, 'Ostrich nominalism'. This is because, according to him, dismissing this as a problem means refusing to solve it, like an ostrich would do by sticking its head in the sand. However, I still can't manage to see why a is F and b is F both being true is problematic at all. Could you perhaps enlighten me? I've tried by reading books and practically all the SEP/IEP articles on the subject, but these mainly address the solutions, which are hard to understand to someone, like me, who hasn't even got what the problem is all about. 

To me, for two particulars a and b to have the same property F, or be of the same type F, simply means that "a is F and b is F*. But I don't see why the fact that "a is F and b is F" is puzzling at all. Why does the fact that "a is F" and "b is F" need to be accounted for? I really don't see any kind of incompatibility, while for Armstrong the fact that both propositions are true is, prima facie, a good reason to postulate the existence of a rather bizarre kind of entities (namely, Universals). In fact, he writes 

Feser is using the correct definition of necessity and possibility. Were he not, the proposition "But it is impossible for these always to exist, for that which is possible not to be at some time is not" would be clearly false. I think that in Feser's understanding the argument goes about some way like this: Suppose that everything which exists here and now is contingent, and there is no necessary being. Now, what we want to do now is to prove that under this assumption we must admit that the world (made only of contingent things) must have had a beginning in time, i.e., there was a time when no contingent thing (and thus nothing, under our assumption) existed. Suppose that the thesis were false, that is, that the world has always existed. This means that all contingent things have existed for an infinite amount of time. But this is impossible, since, given a long enough amount of time, contingent things will eventually corrupt. I think, however, that the Third Way, even as Feser puts it, contains a logical mistake. What we have proven is that if everything is contingent, that only those things which exist here and now, the world of contingent things at a given instant must have had a beginning in time, before which other contingent things, which do not exist anymore now, existed and generated the current world. I don't know if I've got my point across. Feel free to ask for clarifications. 

For Capitalism The capitalist is likely to speak of capitalism being conducive to human freedom (freedom to buy and sell, enter into contracts), and to the generation of wealth and prosperity for mankind. He is likely to speak of its efficiency with respect to classical economics - the invisible hand through the price mechanism equilibrates supply and demand, so that the market clears (everyone is satisfied). And possibly, that capitalism encourages thrift and industry - which are virtues (although, this is susceptible to the immediate retort that we are conditioned to think of these as virtues, because they are useful within capitalism, not because they have any timeless worth). 

Understanding capitalism requires understanding a constellation of concepts that reinforce each other. I'll try to make some headway here. A helpful way to think about capital is as the aggregate of all non-labour inputs to production. Some would include land as a factor of production as well, and some others would consider human capital to be a form of capital (typically when explaining why capital in aggregate does not run up against the problem of diminishing marginal returns.) The defining characteristic of capitalism is that capital is privately owned. As you can see, it is compatible with a great diversity of political systems (ranging from the illiberal democracies of Singapore, to the authoritarianism of China, to the democracies in the West). Because capital is privately owned, it is typically invested in such a way as to maximise profit. This isn't necessarily the case, and some people might invest their private wealth in non-profit organisations. But the dominant paradigm is typically acquisition for private gain. The term became popular in its modern usage sometime in the middle of the 19th century, possibly slightly earlier. Marx was probably not the originator, but he was definitely contemporaneous with others who did. Potentially Proudhon and socialists of other stripes. Since then the left has kept this usage alive, together with the oft-mentioned 'bourgeois mode of production' - which is essentially synonymous.
