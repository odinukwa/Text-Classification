I think an excellent example of communist societies would be small tribal societies, before the industrial revolution. Means of production were generally shared and workers generally worked to benefit the societal unit which worked because individual societies generally small and tribal. In modern day industrialized society I think the answer is probably no given the difficulty of convincing workers to not take the whole fruits of their labor and instead share it with the rest of society, most of whom they will never meet. 

($URL$ An employee fridge clearly fits the second two requirements, as for the first requirement if having an employee fridge raises moral, and thus indirectly increases employee productivity, then I would consider it to be a capital good because it would seem to be a factor of production. 

If I understand correctly you are asking for a model of the price of bitcoin based on the number of transactions. This is impossible for a number of reasons. 1) Theres not necessarily a relationship between those two variables 2) Even if there is a relationship between the two variables then there may be other variables which have an equal or stronger effect (very likely) making the variable a bad predictor. 3) If there is a relationship, and that relationship is not causal then knowing the relationship would cause it to cease to exist as people begin to trade on arbitrage with that model which would cause it to stop being effective. 4) If I could model the price of bitcoin I certainly wouldn't be telling you, instead I'd be living it up on some private island. The question makes no sense and is by far too complicated of a question. This is the type of topic that requires a research paper and will not necessarily provide results. This is why you are getting downvoted. Because there is no logical answer to what you are asking. 

Elasticity of demand is almost always assumed to be negative. It is assumed that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded. If you want to buy 2 hamburgers for each you aren't suddenly going to want to buy 3 hamburgers if they now cost each. If this isn't the case it means that consumers aren't rational which blows up 99% of the models economics has to offer. Because the elasticity of demand is always negative it can be assumed that if I say X is the elasticity of demand I mean X is negative because elasticity of demand is always negative. If I say -X is the elasticity of demand you can still assume that it is negative because a) I said it explicitly, and b) it is always true. At this point it's just a matter of preference and doesn't matter either way, I just wanted to explain why it really doesn't matter since someone who understands what elasticity of demand means will understand that it will always be negative in almost all scenarios. Personally, I think that explicitly saying that the elasticity of demand is negative is a better choice since I can imagine some fringe scenarios where a product being expensive leads to that product being sold more often, (I think of caviar as an example for these types of products, where consumers buy it precisely because its expensive) but for most economic models the assumption holds. 

You count the depreciation of all goods. Lets imagine a hypothetical scenario where you buy a capital good of a tractor. The tractor will cost and last 10 years. On the tenth year you know that the tractor will explode and be completely worthless and useless meaning you'll have to buy a new tractor for . Under GAAP accounting you don't record that the tractor suddenly became worthless on the 10th year. Instead you estimate in the beginning the overall lifetime of the tractor and divide that by the cost of the tractor. Thus, the tractor will depreciate by every year. You do this because it is a better indication of the value of the asset(capital good) you have left of the tractor despite the fact that the tractor may work perfectly fine for all 10 of those years. The same is true for capital goods. You simply take the expected working life of the capital and depreciate it by its original cost every year from then on. Taken in the aggregate across all capital goods you must have equal level of investment into capital as you have depreciation in order to maintain a certain level of capital in the steady state. 

A key component of Gresham's Law is that people will spend the less valuable asset such as gold or silver if they legally have the same face value. Sea shells and beads certainly didn't have the same value or demand within the colonies as British coin. You can't pay for import goods, taxes, or use the company store using beads or shells. Instead the issue that the colonies faced was that the British refused to pay them in coin but rather paid them in goods. If your colony wanted the manufactured British textiles then you would send a shipment of tobacco to receive it. There was an extremely limited supply of British coin in the colonies and so as a result alternatives, such as the wampum which was used by the local Indian tribes had to be adopted. Eventually the British realized their system wasn't working and began sending over gold and silver coin. These coins were worth more on their face and probably could be considered a less volatile currency and so it was adopted in favor of the wampum which was then phased out of the colonies. 

A good one is where the equilibrium is on the laffer curve and thus what the level of taxation for a society should be. $URL$ If what you're looking for is all the unsolved questions in economics you're going to have a pretty long list. 

The Fed controls the nominal money supply as they are the only ones who can add or remove money from the economy by printing it. Real money supply is only affected by increases or decreases in inflation and is fixed assuming inflation is 0. In the IS-LM model which is what I assume you are referring to it is assumed that inflation is fixed or that the fed will maintain the real money supply at a given point by changing the nominal money supply for given price levels. Graphically money supply can be shown like so: 

The purpose of a 2nd price auction (Vickrey Auction) is to encourage bidders to bid their true maximum willing payment for a good rather than the lowest price they expect will win the auction. The reason for this is because they pay the value of the unknown second bid they don't have to worry about bidding to high because the highest bid will always pay the exact lowest they would have had to pay in order to obtain the product and don't have to worry about overbidding. For a auction to be called an auction there must be multiple bidders. If I know that I am the only bidder I would always just bid and get everything for free. To prevent this and other types of bidder collusion all auction houses have a minimum starting bid for a product usually determined by the seller. If no one is willing to pay more than the minimum then the product simply wont be sold. Individual rule for vickrey auctions differ depending on the venue but I imagine if only one bid is made then the price would default to the minimum bid set before the auction.
