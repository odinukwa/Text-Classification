E.g. transformational grammars or probabilistic grammars deal with language structures, branching, semantic ranging, etc. They are dealing with more or less 'rational', or logical cocepts. But what if there are grammar which cover such aspects, as ethics (like any language with honorifics, or with status sociolects, like Tamil), or grammars of emotions (from Tamil concepts of agams to emotions coded in grammars of Australian and Amazonian languages)? What are the exact domains of language grammars? Are they ontological, and if they are, is that explicitly or implicitly determined? 

The thing is that two musical systems are different, the Occidental being septatonic and the Oriental, pentatonic. Thus, 'western' music distiguishes seven tones, while 'eastern' music distiguishes five tones. However, in both musical metanarrations the 4:3 and 3:2 ratios are used for the melos and canon settings. And, yes, there was a time when septatonic scale was also applied in Chinese music. Here is a link to Chinese poetry transcribed in western alphabet and read by native speakers along with the Chinese music played (sorry, the translations are in Russian only). One can notice that there is a certain match between the tones in Chinese speech and those in the music. 

This thought occured to me after having a closed question read here. I drew five language trees for a same sentence rendered in five different languages, and the result was quite interesting. Sentences were structured a little bit differently according to a type, and so were the language trees. I was taking English, Russian, Fínnish, Estonian and Swedish as sample languages. Then I wrote and structured it in Dutch, Spanish, Polish, Bulgarian and French. The languages, however different in their typologies, have some similar features (e.g. English is more like Swedish, and Finnish is much like Estonian). There were also differences in language trees depending on language analytism, flections and possible word order. The differences may be, however, described by submodalities of personal ideolect as well. I have not compared yet the languages by the thorough atlas with wide parameter scope. Unfortunately, my knowledge of other languages (e.g. that of Arabic, Yoruba or Chinese) was not sufficient to present more data on languages of other types, so I am presenting this question to the Community. If they are, then what is the main typological factor for the language tree discrepancy? 

In my opinion, they should. E.g. in Finnish perfective olen purenut (I have biten/gnawed) could be combined either with 'tätä palaa' (imperfect+infinite) or 'tämän palan' (perfect+finite). The verb itself is mostly perfective, as counterpointed with a frequentative/imperfective 'pureskella'. This phrase could also have an imperfective aspect: *olen pureskellut (perfect, imperfective/ pureskelin (imperfect, imperfective) * X tämän palan loppuun (this piece till the end; perfect+finite) / tätä palaa vähän aikaa (this piece for a while, imperfect+finite). Any combination could be grammatical (although not necessarily of a highly frequent usage). If we stick to the IE paradigm of perfectiveness/imperfectiveness being represented by the verbs only, then we would get 'a perfect tense of an imperfective (frequentative) verb'. In Russian, the verbs касаться/коснуться (to touch) are perfective, while трогать/дотронуться (to touch) are imperfective. The forms дотронуться/притронуться/потрогать would be a perfect-type of imperfective verb, while касаться would be an imperfect-type of perfective. 

Among ancient languages, there are certain traits of aggluttination in Hittite (especially in its verbs of mi-class). If you are interested in living languages, then one of the possible suggestions would be verbs of the regular -ar or -er types in modern Swedish. The -ar- type is a type of verbs of regular declention taking, like the rest of regular Swedish verbs, a similar ending (here, -ar) for all and any personal forms in Present. Consider e.g. the verb att svara (to answer): 

And is Tuscan regarded as a dialect or as a language by modern Italian linguists? I am interested mostly in its lexical peculiarities, but some interesting features of syntax would be of a great value, too. The main thing is that the features should make this dialect different from other varieties of Italian and/or other Romance dialects/languages. Please notice that the phenomenon of Tuscan gorgia is already known to me. Have there ever been literature written in this dialect (and not in the Italian per se, which, to the best of my knowledge, is also based on Tuscan)? Are there any documents to attest its development on time? 

Thanks for the interesting question. A first thing to do would be to verify the fact that this is really a language and not a, say, ornament. To distinguish asignal from noise, so to say. This could be done by identifying a writing system as such (that is, to check wheather it's abugida, glyphs, pictogramms, or other). Then, because it's a fiction, we have to check if that's a language of human species or other. Just by establishing a writing system alone we could not make any noticeable progress. Even a 'Rosetta stone' with a known nature of writing and its language type would be a poor clue (as it is the case with both Khitan Scripts). So, depending on a writing and a language types, the first step is to identify them, and then, the repeating combinations of signs (provided there are any). If we regard a language of a human kind, then a sequence of pictures with inscriptions could be a great help, but not numbers, because numbers can be tricky (to mention a few - several different words for 'five' depending on a grammatical class of items counted; different types of numbers for animate and inanimate objects, and even types of numbers other than singular, dual and plural). Also, because we regard a proto-language, it could be untuitevely understood by everybody and with a same meaning (yes, a myth of proto-language from which the other languages appeared as a golden dream of (the post-)Christian mankind). In this case, researches would only have to identify the writing system and the grammer (but this, again, depends on how much 'fiction' you want to put into your story). 

If the word नर [nara], sometimes represented as नार [nāra] primarly means 'man, human, person' and the word नारक / नरक [nāraka / naraka] means 'hell', 'infernal' and/or 'inhabitant of hell', then where did this meaning come from? Are these two words related? And is it possibly because of क [ka] being a particle for inanimate / unconscious agent (inanimate causative)? 

I think it is a matter of presence/absence of a phonetic system within a given language as a milestone for comparison-contrast procedure, either historically or diachronically. Or maybe there is no relation between a phonetical inventory and a number of allophones at all. The point is, if number of allophones might be regarded within the scope of same inventory (consonants/vowels only), or does it cover the whole phonetical system of a language. E.g. Sanskrit has three primal vowels (a/i/u), which produce long vowels and diphtongs, yet its consonants ṭ,ṭh, t and th (= aspirated t) are regarded as separate consonants, not as allophones. In fact, its vowel phonetic inventory might not be taken as really 'minimal' together with (semi)vowels ṛ,ṝ,ḷ or ḹ. The languages like English or Chinese has no inner comparison/contrast systems, but the number of consonant and vowel allophones in English is bigger as compared to Chinese, perhaps due to the polycentrism of English. Chinese almost has no vowel allophones, and position of phonemes zh, j, x and q is dubious. Well, to a Westerner's ear, at least. One of the languages with a relly minimal vowel inventory is Abkhaz, which has only two distinctive vowels, but a number of Abkhazian consonants equals 58. They are, however, regarded not as allophones of, say, t/tʼ/tʷ, d/dʷ, or h/χʲ/χ/χʷ/χˤ/χˤʷ/ħ/ħʷ sounds, but as separate consonants. In Arabic, (which has not just a/æ/e and i/y allophones, but also a special [o:] phoneme for its Egyptian variety), there is a big set of consonants. There are tˤ/t and x~χ/ħ~ʜ/h phonemes, which are also recognised as different consonants. Let us take as an example the Estonian language which has all the possible dyphtongs and three-grade vowel length (short, long and overlong). All this abundence of phonetics, and overlong vowels as well, happens in initial syllables only, while the rest of Estonian word has either short or long back vowels and long or short consonants. Not too much of vowel allophones, but a system of front/back vocals and long/short vowels and consonants instead. Finnish has the same system (long/short vowels and consonants and front/back vowels together with vowel harmony). Not too much of allophones, either (with the exception of nasalised vowels and n-allophones). Modern Irish has broad/slender comparison paradigms for consonants together with a number of consonant allophones. A number of vowel allophones has survived in Ulster dialect up to day. Additionally, there has been lenis/fortis comparison-contrast paradigm for sonorants. Finally, Russian has palatalised/unpalatalised dychotomy for its comparison-contrast paradigm and a large set of vowel allophones.
