Buddhist and Hindu scriptures are in agreement on this also. The universe had no beginning and has no end; it is infinite and eternal. What we think of as the 'beginning' of the universe is simply the start of a new cycle. The Universe is like a wave or a pulsation which rises and falls. 

The US Declaration of Independence starts with the following: When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. 

I think it is because we are black and white thinkers. That is, we say to ourselves: if we can't prove things with certainty, then, well, every belief is just as 'true' as any other. So, yes, if no logic and objectivity ... then chaos and total subjectivity. ... which is of course a false dilemma brought on by our need to see things in simplistic black or white terms. Indeed, many of us go through these phases as we grow up: first we think that there are clear answers to everything (our elementary and high school teachers certainly make things out to be that way!). Then, we get to college, and our professors suddenly ask us a few questions ... and we revert to claiming things like: "We can't know anything! Everything is relative!". Of course, this move, from 'everything is black and white' to 'everything is equally gray' is still a black and white move. But that phase, fortunately, will pass too: we recognize that while in science we can't prove general principles with 100% certainty, we can nevertheless show that some theories are much more likely than others. And as you say, we are typically quite pragmatic about things in day to day life, thank goodness: we know that cats are fluffy, jumping off cliffs without a parachute is a bad idea, and salad shooters serve little purpose. 

other examples include Katha Upanishad (I. ii. 15) "It is AUM"; Katha Upanishad (I. ii. 17) "This AUM is the best support"; Taittiriya Upanishad (I. viii. 1) "AUM this word is Brahman." Swami Nikhilananda says (The Upanishads, V2, pp 223-224): 

Read "A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations Chicago style for Students and Researchers by Kate L. Turabian. University of Chicago Press. You need to read all of Part I. It deals with how to formulate an academic argument, how to present it. Here are the topic headings for section 5 in Part I. 5. Planning your argument ) What a Research argument is and is not ) Build your argument around answers to readers questions ) Turn your working hypothesis into a Claim ) Assemble the elements of your argument ) Distinguish arguments based on evidence from arguments based on warrants ) Assemble an argument 

I think you can find ideas along these lines in the 'embodied cognition' or 'embedded cognition' views on mind and cognition: these views stress the interaction with the environment as basic. That is, on these views the brain is not so much seen as a disembodied calculator, as it is seen as a very powerful controller. Put differently yet: perception and action are not 'relegated' to 'mere' peripheral input and output devices, but rather our perceptuo-motor abilities are key to our understanding of our mental and cognitive abilities ... and yes, as such, attention and perception are two key components. Just google and plenty will come up. If you want a specific reference, I think the works by the philosopher of mind Andy Clark are highly insightful and very accessible. Another easy read is 'On Intelligence' by Jeff Hawkins; that book also stresses the central role of prediction. 

According to Eastern philosophy, the brain is an organ and suffers death just like the rest of your body. What carries over into a next life is 'impressions' - karma so to speak which happens until your soul escapes the cycles. Buddhists would say that the inertial force of a previous wave carries over into the next manifested wave. From a cosmological viewpoint, the universe is another wave that has it's ebb and tide. After the ebb cycle, a new universe starts. But the sequence of events in each new universe is like throwing a pair of dice. You throw them and get a sequence of 3,7,11 for example. After many more throws you get the same sequence. Maybe 1 time you have to throw 100 times to get the sequence, another time 560 times before the sequence reappears. But it eventually repeats the sequence. Same with events in a universe. Maybe after 5,560,431,280 universes (each lasting tens of billions of years, and maybe some of those universes had different physical laws so they were pretty messed up), the same sequence of events appears as now. Your physical body is reborn and goes through the same events. But, according to Eastern philosophy, another soul is now occupying your body [too long to explain this]. But to your body there is no sense of time between each, all those other universes never existed for it. So in a sense your body is eternal also. 

I would say Hasty Generalization still applies, although since the speaker is trying to argue against the general claim, we can call it a Hasty Refutation But yes, this argument has the further problem of being anecdotal evidence on the basis of personal experience, which means: 

The specifics of your proof will depend on how exactly the prooof system you are working with has defined the rules. Here are the proofs for 1), 2), 3), and 4) using the Fitch proof system as defined in Language, Proof, and Logic (this is a book and software package): 

Now, to get that disjunction, we'll do a proof by Contradiction. Why? Because if you think conceptually about this problem: we know that every object equals either a or b (or both, since a and b may be the same object). So, we know that there are at most two objects in the domain. Therefore, the conclusion makes sense: if there are two different objects c and d, then everything must equal either the one or the other. OK, but how to prove that? Well, take any object e. We know e equals a or b or both. Now, typically, when you go from a disjunction P v Q to a disjunction R v S, you can trace one of the disjunct you want (R) to one of the disjuncts you have (say, Q), while the other disjunct you want (S) comes from the other one you have (P). So, you can do a Proof by cases (v Elim) to do this. But here, that strategy is not going to work: if e = a, can we say that e = c? No. Nor that e = d. Yes, it definitely has to be one or the other, but we just can't tell which one. OK, so a direct Proof by Cases is not going to work. Well, in that case use the other common strategy to prove disjunction: Proof by Contradiction: 

I think that you are confusing some things. Although statistics is a tool, among a wide choice of tools, used in the scientific method, it is not in itself the scientific method. It has also been my understanding that you use the scientific method to prove - not disprove - a hypothesis. In science, proof lies in the assertion, not the negation. Stephen Jay Gould in his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes: Further Reflections on Natural History, specifically Chapter 19: Evolution as Fact and Theory says: 

All cultures have had their own world views that have explained to their cultures and individual minds what it is that we perceive through our five senses. Even those who believe in the physical sciences as their world view have changed over time. I think it was Lord Kelvin who, at the end of the 19th century, said that there was nothing left for us to know of the world, that science had discovered everything there was to know about the physical world. A few years later Madam Curie found a photographic plate that had somehow become exposed when left in a drawer next to a rock. And we know what happened to science after that. The great Harvard professor, Stephen Jay Gould, who unfortunately died about the year 2000, wrote a number of excellent books in the 1980s and 90s (still available and still being published); many had articles dealing with the history of science in the 18th and 19th century. You get a good feel for what was believed by scientists in those times and what was accepted scientific theory. He makes you understand the thought processes they had to go through to change not only science theory, but how scientific men perceived the world in those times. All reasoning and logic are circular. Even math and science eventually melt into metaphysics (what is the definition of a point or a line in math?) What are the most basic theories of quantum physics as to what makes up reality? Every man sees the universe differently. Our minds are unknown to us; what we see is unknown to us. Our minds are x and the universe is y. x perceives y through the senses (and scientific instruments are just an extension to our senses). What is y? We don't know. When we perceive another person or even a table, we see something that is 'solid' - we don't perceive the immense empty space between nucleuses and their electrons or the immense spaces between molecules. They are held together by electromagnetic bonds and in a sense we're perceiving the electromagnetic bonds. TO give you 3 examples of what you think of as scientific beliefs that you probably have, but are just science myths. The first 2 were pointed out by Gould in his books. Life on land evolved from fish. Gould points out that fish have lungs. He then asks, if fish first evolved in water, and land animals evolved from fish, why do fish still have vestigial lungs? Second one is also from Gould. We are all taught that petroleum oil is the result of organic matter that somehow decomposed over millions of year deep in the earth. Gould points out that there is no scientific study ever done that ever presented this to the scientific world. He found the earliest references to this in American primary school books from the early 20th century. A myth that has been perpetuated because we were all taught it from a young age. No one knows where petroleum oil comes from! The third example is one that you test yourself. Almost everyone has seen a full moon on the horizon and seen that it is a lot bigger on the horizon than when an hour or so later it is up in the sky. We've all probably heard that it is because the light on the horizon gets refracted and it appears bigger. No, the thicker air the light has to go through is not refracting it to make it look bigger. It is your own mind fooling you. Next time, make a circle with you thumb and index finger and look through it with one of your eyes at the full moon on the horizon. When you look at the full moon on the horizon this way it now looks the same size as when it's high up in the sky! Now close the one eye and look at it with the other eye that is not looking through your thumb and index finger - it now looks big. Now blink from one eye to the other. small, big, small, big. Your mind is playing tricks on you. But we all have heard the science behind the full moon on the horizon. At one time scientific men believed in epicycles to explain the motion of the planets around the earth. Epicycles wern't dethroned until a newer more simpler more precise theory came (heliocentric solar system). Currently most cosmologists accept dark matter, even though we can't perceive it and can't quite get it too fit. But we need it to support our present scientific world view of cosmology. Dark matter will be around as an accepted scientific principle until we have a newer more elegant and simpler explanation to the universe and the big bang. I wonder how scientific men will perceive the universe in 200 years? Are you a 21st century Lord Kelvin? 

For b): Assuming you cannot have an empty domain (otherwise, all sentences would be vacuously true, and thus true in a finite domain after all), you need at least one object. This object needs to relate to something, but that something cannot be itself, so you need a second object b. b needs to relate to something as well, but that cannot be b itself, and also not a, otherwise by transitivity b relates to b after all. So, b needs to relate to an object c. Etc. And to make that 'Etc.' a little more hard: Note that any model can never have a cycle of aRb, bRc, cRd, ... yRz, zRa, for once you have such a cycle, then by transitivity, all opjects in that cycle end up relating to each other, including themselves, thus contradicting irreflexivity. But if there is no cycle in your structure, then it is possible to 'line' up all objects from 'left' to 'right', such that any R relation goes from 'left' to 'right' as well. But with a finite number of objects, that means that you end up with a 'rightmost' element ... which therefore does not relate to anything, and that contradicts the ∀x∃yRxy So, you can indeed not have any finite model For c) No, you can't just negate the statement to force a finite model. We showed that in order to satisfy the sentences, we need an infinite domain, but all that that means is that in a finite domain, the negation of the statement is indeed true. However, that does not rule out having infinite domains where the negation is also true. Indeed, it is easy to create an infinite model of the negation: just have infinitely many objects, and have them all relate to each other (i.e. define R to be reflexive) 

There has been a lot of research and writing on this. The problem with his premise is that in a collective environment an individual sees his individual goals as part of the collective goals. A core part of this problem deals with trust - how much do you trust the other person in society. There has been a lot of game theory research on this. Some of the more notable ones have been the 'Hawk-Dove' and the 'Prisoner's Dilemma'. The problem with either the individual or collective state is that there are always 'defectors' - how many individuals are working against the stated norm. In the case of a collective, defectors would be people working for themselves, in many cases, corruption. For a good oversight with lots of references I would recommend the book Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive by Bruce Schneier 

First of all: "You drive, therefore you use fossil fuels" is not a fallacy in and of itself. But, in the larger context of this debate on climate change, when Mr.B offers this as a criticism of Mr.A's position on climate change, it is indeed a fallacy. That is, Mr. B is implicitly arguing: "You are saying that in order to mitigate climate change, we should limit our use of fossil fuels ... and yet here you are driving a car! So why should we listen to you? You're a hypocrite, and thus you're wrong!" Well, that's a combination of inconsistency ad hominem and perfectionist fallacy. It's like: "how come you're telling us to become vegetarians when you're still wearing leather shoes!" That is, until the person is somehow perfectly living out their convictions, then somehow their convictions are mistaken ... which is a fallacy in two ways: First, the suggestion is that one should either act perfectly on their convictions or else there is no point to their convictions at all. That's like saying: either this gun control policy erases all forms of gun violence, or there is no point to it. That's a perfectionist fallacy (a form of false dilemma), since doing something can still be better than doing nothing at all. In this particular case, it is pretty much impossible (certainly given the currently existing societal infrastructures) to live in a way that completely avoids the use of fossil fuels, but that of course does not mean that one shouldn't even try to limit one's use of fossil fuels at all. Second, even if one would somehow be able to completely avoid the use of fossil fuels, then the fact that this person doesn't do that doesn't mean that this person's belief that limiting the use of fossil fuels as much as possible is wrong. That's the inconsistency ad hominem: the person is seen as being inconsistent and hypocritical in not practicing what they preach, but that does not mean that what they preach is wrong. The pot calling the kettle black is not wrong in calling the kettle black just because the pot itself is black ... the pot can be perfectly correct in calling the kettle black and is fully allowed to call the kettle black.
