Firstly, it's right to say that the hard ending rule on ebay seems to be behind sniping. Here's a figure from Roth & Ockenfels' AER paper: 

The branch of microeconomics that you seem to be looking for is the study of externalitiesâ€”activities that have side-effects that (positively or negatively) effect the welfare of others. The Wikipedia article on the topic is here. Any good introductory/undergraduate level textbook will have a treatment of this topic. For example, Hal Varian's "Intermediate Microeconomics: A Modern Approach" (which would be my recommended first port of call) has a chapter on externalities. A slightly more specialised treatment can be found in a textbook on so-called public economics such as "Intermediate Public Economics" by Myles and Hindriks. These books also contain examples of how goods with externalities can be formally modeled. Alternatively, because externalities are a standard element of the economics curriculum, a Google search for "Externalities lecture notes" will turn up lots of freely-accessable PDFs that give a good overview. 

Now, if we allow for multiple pledge levels then things become much more complicated. Firstly, we need a model of the behaviour of people and why it is that some people might pledge more than others. If, for example, we are working in a Kickstarter-like environment then the main motive would be to get the goodies that come with the higher pledge tier. But that means we need a model not only of the pledge levels, but what you get in return. A complete treatment of this is beyond the scope of this answer, but a fairly readable summary can be found in "Versioning Information Goods" by Hal Varian. If you want a more detailed, technical treatment then the best place to look is "The Economics of Contracts: A Primer" by Salanie. 

Perhaps someone with more expertise on the matter can answer your question more directly, but in the mean time: In the literature on innovation, it is fairly common to use patent data to measure the intensity of innovation activity. Here are Aghion et al (2005) on their approach: 

This should probably be a comment, but it's too long so I am posting it as an answer. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with "[A Pigouvian tax] is a fixed unit price, which cannot be efficient if the damage costs are highly non-linear." But I do definitely agree with the fact that non-linearity causes practical problems for a Pigovian implementation, as I note below. 

I would expect necessity goods to have an income elasticity between 0 and 1 in keeping with Engel's Law, which was originally observed for food (an obvious necessity good). Housing indeed exhibits this feature because poorer households spend a larger fraction of their income on housing. That makes housing look like a necessity good. E.g., 

If you use Wolfram Mathematica on your PC then you can import the data directly for processing using the command (see here). 

I think the appropriate discretisation should be something like $$C_i=\left[\int_0^i\!c(i)^{1-\alpha}\,di\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}=\lim_{I\rightarrow\infty}\left[\sum_{j=0}^{(I-1)i}\frac{1}{I}c\left(\frac{j}{I}\right)^{1-\alpha}\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}$$ The below figure illustrates where each term of the sum comes from (for the case of $I=5$) 

You say that losses are reduced by investment, so we can write the (private) loss as a function of own investment and others' investment: $l^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})$ with $l^i_1(c_i,,\mathbf{c}^{-i})<0$. Player $i$'s utility is $U^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})=-f(l^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i}))-c^i$ and he invests until the first-order condition is satisfied: $$-f'[l^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})]l^i_1(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})-1=0.$$ The social loss is $$\sum_i\left[-f_i(l^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i}))-c_i\right]$$ so that the first-order condition for the optimal $c^i$ is $$-f'[l^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})]l^i_1(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})-\left[\sum_{j\neq i}f'[l^j(c^j,\mathbf{c}^{-j})]\frac{\partial}{\partial c^i}l^j(c^j,\mathbf{c}^{-j})\right]-1=0.$$ This now looks like a standard externality model, where the external benefit of $i$'s investment is $$b^i(\mathbf{c}^{-i})=-\sum_{j\neq i}f'[l^j(c^j,\mathbf{c}^{-j})]\frac{\partial}{\partial c^i}l^j(c^j,\mathbf{c}^{-j})>0.$$ If $l^i(\cdot)$ are publicly known then the problem can easily be solved as by imposing upon $i$ a standard Pigouvian subsidy of $b^i(\mathbf{c}^{-i})$ per unit of investment. This means that $i$'s payoff (including the subsidy) when $j\neq i$ choose $\mathbf{c}^{-i}$ is $$\underbrace{-f(l^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i}))-c^i}_{U^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})}+b^i(\mathbf{c}^{-i})c^i.$$ A rational $i$ will maximise this subsidy-augmented payoff; his first order condition is $$-f'[l^i(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})]l^i_1(c^i,\mathbf{c}^{-i})\underbrace{-\left[\sum_{j\neq i}f'[l^j(c^j,\mathbf{c}^{-j})]\frac{\partial}{\partial c^i}l^j(c^j,c^{-j})\right]}_{b^i(\mathbf{c}^{-i})}-1=0,$$ which is exactly the same as the first-order condition used to maximise social welfare. It is therefore a Nash equilibrium for each $i$ to choose the socially efficient level of investment given that everyone else does the same. 

The grocery store example is probably the closest thing to what would commonly be understood as a loss-leader. The reason this strategy works is because consumers face some kind of friction that makes them disproportionately prefer one-stop shopping to visiting many stores (e.g. becoming informed about different stores is costly, switching stores in the middle of a shop is costly, etc.). The fact that consumers don't want to go to many stores means that once they are attracted into a store by a low price, they can be exploited with higher prices on other goods. To reiterate: note that this business model is driven by a feature of consumers' behaviour (search/shopping frictions). 

The consumer can trade from their endowment to any point along this line. By inspection, you should be able to figure out what the demand vector $\mathbf{x}=(x_1,x_2)$ will be. 

What is value? Ultimately, value flows from the utility people get from consuming goods and services. Now, suppose, in your example world, I am a farmer and it is Autumn so I have the product of a large harvest. Here are three things I could do with it: 

If measures like GDP are known to be so flawed, why are they used? It is important to understand that no serious economist cares about GDP per se. Instead, economists stress the importance of a portfolio of policies that work together to improve overall well-being of the populace. There are many factors that weigh on well-being. These include income and productivity (which will show up in GDP), but also technological innovation, environmental improvement, improved health outcomes, reduced inequality, and so on. Given these objectives, some way is needed to measure the efficacy of policy. Because the agenda is multi-faceted, we need enough indicators to measure the various dimensions we are interested in. GDP is useful because it is a widely-available measure of one part of what economists are interested in (material wellbeing). But this should not be confused with a situation where GDP is the objective in its own right. Nor should it be thought that economists have no interest in improving upon this measure. The monomaniacal fixation with GDP is really a trait of the media and politics rather than practicing economists. 

Paying the seller a subsidy of $S=p^s-p^d$ per unit sold has an effect equivalent to reducing his marginal cost by $S$. The seller's marginal cost curve shifts down in the same way as the supply curve in your figure. From the seller's point of view, its as if he is paid price $p^d$ for each unit he sells but had a low marginal cost. When we calculate producer surplus (by looking at the area between the marginal cost curve and the price) this creates some new producer surplus equal to 'the tunnel' (which represents the seller's lower perceived cost). This way of thinking about things gives us the blue area above. The subsidy does not reduce the seller's cost [so the seller's perceived marginal cost curve coincides with S(pre-subsidy)], but the subsidy is paid to 'top-up' the price received by the seller from $p^d$ to $p^s$. So from the seller's point of view it is as if he is being paid price $p^s$ with a high marginal cost. When we calculate producer surplus we look at the green area in the following figure:
