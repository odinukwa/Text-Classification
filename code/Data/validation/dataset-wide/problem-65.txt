While others are focused on surviving the roaming golems, I'm trying to imagine ways they could be exploited for profit. Once humans figured out the limit of people the golems will allow on them, they could be used for transportation. Sure, it looks like humans can't control the golem's direction, but a "driver" could send out messages to people where its heading. Bear in mind this transformation is inferior to most ride-able animals, but its a luxury I could imagine people would go for. Speaking of "drivers", setting up the equivalent of a lighthouse on the giants would be useful for travelers. This might be a dude with a churchbell on the giants dome or an actual lighthouse based on the era. With these convenient walking signposts, caravans could follow golems and trade with people who saw the signals. For bonus points, imagine having the wagon tethered to the golem's waist and getting pulled along that way. And just because no setting is complete without some darkness, some societies could use golems to execute criminals. Tie them where the golem will walk and let the seemingly divine being crush them into pepperoni with their unceasing feet. Oh, and people altering themselves to look like the golems might be a facet of some religions. edit- Birds would love these things! Same with whatever plants that could live on them. I can't imagine a better system for spreading your seeds. 

Chaos theory kinda forces these two earths to diverge in drastic ways regardless of the closeness of their starting conditions. Maybe the Cuban missile crisis triggered a thermonuclear war, maybe William Shakespeare advocated for a democratic republic in Britain, maybe the Assyrian empire conquered Persia, maybe all the first humans were eaten by wolfs, and maybe its maybelline. 

The features you listed all seems well enough. Keep in mind most modern combat helmets are designed to defend against scrapnal and concussions, so the dude's wearing your helmets may be prepared to enter a melee fight at a moments notice. This makes me think they are a police unit or some other force that expects to deal with nearly-unarmed combatants. Considering intimidation seems to be a key feature of this design, maybe they are part of a totalitarian police force or some kind of highly armed bank robbers? The former makes more thematic sense to me, as fascists love greco-roman inspirations. The only things I think are worth considering is that the eyeholes might obscure some of the wearer's vision (or not. I only mention it because it could be a plot point) and the 2.0 version doesn't include protection against chemical weapons (which might not be a big deal, depending on what role you want these dudes to have). 

I think this is less "what could androids trade" and more "what do non-androids (I'm assuming humans) need?" Assuming these androids have superior strength, or at least superior stamina, they could spend time tilling soil and farming crops to trade to humans for specified parts. Farming is stupidly hard work without dedicated equipment, and would be made doubly difficult by massive environmental collapse. Both models of androids would be able to work around the clock and ignore issues like sunstroke or exhaustion. You could say the domestic models could effectively raise animals. After all, they would understand nutrition and animal behavior (lots of families have pets). As for the manufacture models, they would be tractors, trailers, forklifts, and digging machines all at the same time. Plus, if you wanted, you could say they have enough pre-apocalypse knowledge to build breweries, which is the trade good to end all trade goods. Other than making wasteland life worth living, booze could prevent infections and purify stagnant water. It also doesn't soil quickly, so the androids could make a stockpile until humans visited. Making them smarter than humans could open a can of worms, though. Eh, they could figure out fermentation through trail and error. Either way, alcohol would be a great thing for them to manufacture and trade. Right now this community is in a bad place, economically speaking. The resource they need seems to be finite, as no one can manufacture new fusion batteries. A huge portion of there time might be spent looking from new stockpiles or scavenging ruins. If they aren't nomadic, they would probably put the word out they want those fusion batteries so humans can look for them. Just one could be worth a whole cow to a android. Its a situation that humans could easily exploit unless androids are proactive. "You can trade those two Fusion batteries for eight barrels of water, but if you go any higher they might just shoot you and take them for nothing. They know people will still trade with them if they do. The payout is worth it." If I were on team android (go electric sheep!), I would spend a lot of time trying to get a fusion battery manufacturing machine working again. Until I do that, my entire people are just living on borrowed time. That or trying to convert to other forms of batteries. Living with a power-cord plugged into a twenty pound lithium battery would be a pain, but at least I'd still be alive. Got to make sure I can defend my homeland, too. I have a lot of nice trade goods, a finite number of allies, and need a lot of time and effort to repair myself if I get injured. Humans might decide to litter my fields with landmines or take potshots with long ranged rifles. Doesn't matter how durable I am, they can wear me down. Isolationism (like you said) and a zero-tolerance policy to weapons that are capable of hurting me would be ideal. This is a really fun situation you cooked up. 

From my limited knowledge of anthropology, female gods are usually the first beings a forming civilizations worships, with masculine gods coming later. This is due to the "magic" or babies being associated women (ancient males didn't even think they had anything to do with the process in some locations). When males eventually come to power, which is usually assumed to be a result of male hunters "unionizing" against the usually female gathers, the new masculine gods are created to legitimize their authority. If your society is exceptionally old or particularly good at recording their own history, a mother-goddess might possibly still be worshiped. Even then, other masculine sub-deities might exist to legitimize the patriarchy. For example, the goddess is herself female, but the angels of war, knowledge, craftsmanship, and medicine happen to be male. Sorry I can't give any exact sources. I'm just remembering tidbits from a class I took in college. 

Normally, I'd be confused why an a group of intensively powerful individuals would be able to be oppressed into servitude, but your inconsistency of magic and insanity seem to be good counters. There is the problem of the state being able to "manufacture" mages. Mages wouldn't want to become mages cause its a massive health risk with a boatload of social stigma that won't pay, and the state would be dumb if they tried and force people to spend years studying magic-craft. "Lean how to generate explosions, turn humans into stone, and summon legions of daemons so I can whip you into complying with my needs, dang it!" The potential for ex-military domestic terrorist mages would be massive, even without the insanity angle. So you need friendlier government recruiters and a incentive for magic sensitive people to become full on mages. I think you accomplished this with mental illness being common among the sensitives, and the symptoms being alleviated with increased magic skill (and maybe some rituals or materials). Picture this: A character is huddled in a padded cell, covering their head with their arms and muttering to themselves. The door opens, and a man in a spotlessly clean uniform walks in. As the character retreats, the man draws a symbol on the wall and charges it with more magical energy than the character thought possible. Instantly, the voices vanish and the room stops spinning. As the character feels relief for the first time in years, the man in the uniform being a speal about the nobility of serving ones country and the duty of the magically gifted. But the real message is crystal clear. Say yes, and they will teach you how to feel human again. Say no, and I will leave you right where they found you. After that, the system is maintained by your system of checks-and-balances and the states ability to recruit new mages to replace the ones that die. For example, they might build asylums purposely near areas were magic fields are know to form in order to root out magically sensitive people. Finding ways to keep mages from "unionizing" would also be a priority of the state, like stationing mages far apart, limiting their ability to communicate with each other, and purposely generating factions (having three magic ministrations that compete for funding and public opinion, for example, or even playing the nine specialization of magic against each other). As a whole, I think your system makes sense. Keep in mind that, while completely altruistic recruiters and handlers would definitely exist, the real incentive to for a government to fund mages would be profit. Even with the unreliability of magic, mages would be a huge economic boon and military deterrent. A lot of people in the state would think about mages as finicky, disposable tools rather than human with real problems. Another think to think about is the reputation of mages before the state started training and utilizing them. Do the general public tell stories about mages that became serial killers or leveled churches to the ground? How many example of benevolent mages are there? Is the state posting flyers warning the public about mages or posters trying to make mages look heroic and selfless to fix their previous reputation? I'm not sure why the mages would be payed only in room and board, though. Being able to buy your own food and some nice posters for your bunk is great for morale. If you need to control them, just don't pay them very much. Sooooo, yeah. I like your idea and it defiantly engages me. Sorry that half of my answer is basically just restating your question. 

I think I could believe a story with this set up, since mother nature pulls some bullcrap similar to your creatures. Bombardier beetles utilize chemical explosives as a defense mechanism and woodpeckers deal with freakish amount of force being self applied to their bodies, so truth might be as strange as your fiction. Heck, mantis shrimp punches have a snap that can probably rival the most overpowered mousetraps on the market. Keep in mind that the fish that make up their diet might have to be durable, as well as fast, to justify this evolved specialization. Otherwise it would be smarter to evolve something to spear the fish, like a crane's beak or a preying mantis' claw-things. A magic weed that produces explosive chemicals would probably be a good addition to this story as a way to make your boom-agators seem more plausible. Not only that, but you could have your character try and make weapons out of the weeds, only to realize he can't get the purity he needs. "I'll have to take it from the gators. **** me." Oh, and peat moss is a plant that utilizes explosive force to launch its seeds, so your magic weed can be justified as well. (Huh. That is the first time I have used the term magic weed and actually ment a weed that has supernatural properties.) 

Rot and smell would be an issue, but you could fix that with the same magic that animates them. Maybe say the spell makes all flesh act as though it was alive, so rotting only occurs in bloodless limbs? That might ruin your aesthetic, but you get the idea. Alternatively, embalming (draining the corpse of blood and replacing the blood with a preserving fluid like formaldehyde) would slow decay to more manageable levels. This just takes a pump, a hose, and something sharp, so it should be possible with medieval-level technology. Maybe the servants are stored in salt when not in use? Rats and (especially) scavenging birds would be a huge problem for all kinds of hygienic and preserving reasons. Other than paying for bird-hunters and putting spikes on everything, servants who work outdoor could wear iron masks and thick clothes to prevent birds from eating their bits. This might also help against being baked into jerky by the sun, so win-win. (Plus the spikes and clothing would be creepy as all heck, and that's just fun to write). Dropping bits would be a major source of disease and would definitely clutter the streets. In medieval times, they could just grin-and-bear with it, but hiring some street sweepers might be prudent. There also might be an issue with stray dogs and cats learning that the zombie (and, by extension, humans) can be eaten. Socially, this would have some huge effects, but that would be depended on what religions you have in your world, if and how veneration of the dead takes place, and whether zombies can be used in warfare. If the last point is true, that's a massive world-building can of worms.
