I'm an intern working at a software company. I have been here for a few months now, and my internship is coming to an end. My school requires feedback forms from people I have worked directly with during the time of my internship. These forms are quite extensive, and could take an hour to fill in (If not more). These feedback forms show the school how I have been doing during my internship, so they tackle subjects like 'Performance in Team' or 'The student works independent', just to give some examples. I have worked with 2 people directly, the CEO of the company and the product owner of the team I was in. Recently, the product owner got assigned a new task, and is extremely busy. (Last day, he continued working until 11pm). I have asked both if they wanted to fill in the form, and they both agreed. Today, I received the form from my CEO, but my product owner hasn't filled in anything yet. I assumed it was because he's very busy. When I asked him yesterday if he could fill it in tomorrow (Today) he apologized for being late, and promised to fill it in first thing tomorrow. I haven't received anything at the time of writing this, and my deadline is coming up. It isn't a possibility to ask someone else, since they were the only 2 people I worked directly with. I also don't want to bother him too much, since he's already pretty stressed out. What would be the best course of action to do? I don't want to annoy people here, but I do have that deadline coming up... Edit: I forgot to mention the deadline for me handing in the report was supposed to be today. I have sent a mail to school asking if it's possible to hand it in later. 

I have been an intern for this company for a few months now, and recently they hired someone to help on the project we're working on, I'll call him John for this post. When he first started here, someone with autism, I'll call him Pete for now, was working in the same room where he was placed. (I have had no problems working with him before). John gets agitated very quickly about his code 'lying' (as he puts it) and gets quite vocal about it. This didn't sit very well with Pete, and after a few clashes, including talks with the product owner and even CEO, John calmed down a lot. After a few weeks, Pete left the company. After Pete left, John started being very agitated again. I'll give you an example what happens: When he gets errors in his code, or something else that doesn't work, he starts saying things like 'Hahaha, nice try...' or 'Cmon, don't be so childish' every few minutes, which isn't all that bad. The bad part starts when this continues for 15 minutes and he starts cursing. Nothing serious, just things like 'fuck' or 'shit'. When he can't seem to solve his problem, he starts standing up and walking around the room. Usually he walks behind me for a few steps, and walks back, sits down, and repeats this for a while. Now I don't know if I should say something about this. This has lead me to wearing headphones in the office, which I realise might come over as rude to other colleagues who also work in the same room. Also, no one else seems to notice or seems to be annoyed by it, am I just getting annoyed too quickly? Also, am I supposed to let him know as an intern? I have discussed this with my product owner, who is aware of the problem, John just doesn't seem to learn from it and continues being like this. Is this normal in an office? Edit: I'll add more information about his obnoxious behaviour, since it doesn't end there. John really wants to be a part of everything he hears. No matter what conversation, he has his opinion. And no matter what topic, he wants to talk about him and all the studies he has done. Whenever you try to have any type of conversation with him around, he'll talk about 100 different things which might be related. (Let's say a casual talk about the weather, he'll start talking about his study in chemistry and how about pollution is ruining China) Any conversation he's not a part of, he'll still laugh out loud when they make a joke. After that he tries to chip in on the conversation, even though the people talking are pretty blunt he wasn't included in the conversation. 

I don't see the need to burn any bridges here. If the person was asking for a recommendation then your professional image would be on the line and then you would have to think twice but as it is, you could easily with one little email send the person the details of the manager or even just a link to the job posting. This makes you seem like the helpful one and even if it does happen that the person is not suitable, you are not the bad guy. It is after all not your job to do the hiring. Maybe you are not even able to judge a worthy candidate seeing as there may be mitigating circumstances to this person hiring that you may simply be unaware of. 

Computer works should not be impossible, I have found typing is OK. Writing by hand is really hard though. A good spell checker like Grammarly will sure up many of your spelling difficulties. As always, pick trough the things you type with a small toothed comb. Don't type important things too fast and read through the things you write multiple times. When you have to read things, read slowly and make sure you don't read what you think the message is but what is actually written on the page. Discuss the issue with HR manager, not with any other management. This is a personal issue, the HR people will be more likely to handle it with the necessary sensitivity. Discussing it at least with someone at the company will also have the added benefit of promoting a feeling of mutual trust with your employer. Divulging such personal details just in case it may affect your work will at the very least give the impression that you take your work seriously. 

What does it matter? You seem to be under the impression that the fact that the possible employee had his/her parent at the interview indicates a lack of maturity but that may very easily not be the case. Why is it though that a parent bringing a child to an interview is more of a problem than a cabby bringing him? If the cabby was willing to wait an hour before taking the interviewer home would that have been a problem for you? Even if the whole premise of your argument is true and this is one massive mommies-boy who will suck at the teat of his parents for the rest of his life, what does this matter? Are his qualifications and experience predicated on what you consider to be "mature"? You are there to make a decision on whether this person is the ideal candidate for a job listing, not to make judgments on what you perceive to be a lack of maturity, if this is the type of thing that bothers you from a programmer then you are going to find it hard to find a candidate. Most programmers I know are a-social, borderline sociopaths with a god-complex dependant on the level of salary. Having mommy issues would be appropriate. 

Generally speaking, no full-time employment will commence without a work contract in place. In most cases what your employer expects from you will be made plain. So except maybe if it is expressly mentioned that wages will be reduced for slow work what he is doing is most probably a breach of contract. Even if tardiness is mentioned in the contract, contract law does provide the remedy that if a contract is deemed to be grossly unfair to one party then a petition can be made to make it invalid. I think you would have a decent case for that. Remember that a work contract is like any other, both parties have the right to have it enforced. You may want to employ the council of a labor attorney or at the very least a union rep, this seems to be exactly the type of exploitive behavior they fight against. 

If you were my employee and you did that, I would be pretty sure that I can never trust you with anything of importance again. You would be in the "only ever does what he likes" drawer for the rest of the time, and I would not go out of my way to get you to develop into more mature directions. You do not want to be in that drawer; there may well be "boss decisions" in the future where you would be glad to be involved in instead of learning about them after the fact. If you really do not wish to develop in that direction I interpret the answer in the light of an "event" - i.e., a current project, where the boss needs something from you. One exemption to the things I write here is if the boss tells you that he wants to develop you from being a software developer to, for example, a fulltime consultant or team lead, with minimal coding. If you truly do not wish that, you are of course free to (and invited to) tell the boss that (and, if he insists, skip along to looking for a new job). But I do not really get the impression that the boss in our current scenario intends to do anything like that. How to handle this kind of situation Get your act together. If your boss asks you to do something (within boundaries, obviously), there are two possible answers (maybe after you asked to make sure that you really understood what he meant): 

I assume that you are the project lead. Warning: this answer may seem rough/offensive/negative. It is not meant to be, though. Just clear statements without any word-mincing. The term "responsibility" is used in the sense of "accountability", not in the sense of "primary cause". 

I would suggest steering away from this train of thought, which translates to "I did everything great, but my project fails because of XXX which I cannot influence". If your project is flailing, you, as the project lead, are responsible. Period. No matter what the actual reason is. If there is something that needs to be done, and you are not able to do it, then it is your job to talk with your boss and have him enable you to do it. If your CEO meddles in your project, and you see that it causes the project to fail, then do something. A CEO has no business meddling several steps of hierarchy below. If you tried and tried and tried again, and you cannot stop him meddling, then it's time to look for a new job, not for a raise. At that levels, bosses do not want to hear explanations. Giving explanations is being defensive; and you do not want to look defensive. Although I know nothing about your project, my advice would be: 

TL;DR: I interpret the question as "I am receiving negative feedback and I don't like that negative feedback". I present two main solutions: either to reduce the negative feedback, or to reduce the fact that you don't like it. No sentence of this answer contains sarcasm or irony (including this one), and only this sentence and the one after the quote contain humour. 

I agree with and have upvoted David Schwartz' answer to decline the offer for its simplicity, but would like to stress one point: I find it important that you learn this kind of negotiation for your own sake, especially if you want to go full freelance. The key part is
