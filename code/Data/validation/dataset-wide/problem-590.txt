I would suggest leaving new cable housings as they are. From my experience with riding MTB bikes in different conditions, lubing them only attracts more dust. I suggest regular cleaning and using oil only for short term reviving. These cables need to be replaced once in a while anyway. 

27.5" bikes were introduced after manufacturers found out that they can not produce 29ers with optimal frame geometries for small riders. Considering one of strong sides for 29er vs 26er - tire contact patch, 27.5er is closer to 26er, so no big gains there. There is plenty of marketing information and very little actual research available, so one has to be really careful when reading various manufacturer claims. 

Your bike is designed for riding on rough terrain, like forest trails, roots, take an occasional drop. It should not break after a few drops from low heights, if you apply the technique correctly. Of course, it will shorten its life, so if it becomes regular practice, you should switch your bike from entry level MTB to something more appropriate. You might find stickers on your bike that it is not designed for racing, but just recreation usage. This may put limitations on warranty. 

This should be really asked to you physicist, not bicycle related forum. If you are new to this, this can be "normal", as your bones and ligaments are not used to constant shocks. Do not ignore the pain. Take more time off, if needed. This is typical problem for runners without previous experience. You can not just start running half-martahons without knee pains which can later lead you to meniscus surgery. You need to start slow and use 10% rule (increase your distance/time per week by no more than 10%). 

I am using Garmin Oregon 300, a discontinued model, which should be cheaper on eBay. I have a bike specific mount from Garmin. Pros: 

You will definitely notice the changes. I have found this online calculator to be the best of a kind: $URL$ Just enter your gear combinations (for cogs use custom and drag 6 of them in rigth places) and wheel size. For cadence use values 60-120 (these are "comfortable" values for short periods, "normal" would be around 90) to see the speed you can get with each gear combo. There is also an option to compare two configurations, use your current config as a reference 

Double check the chain - try to bend every link of it. Is there a stiff one? Bend it back and forth. Is the chain clean and well lubed? Also check the derailleur. Is it parallel to the chain line? Look for bent derailleur hanger or other parts. 

Aluminium frames do not corrode, no need to worry. My 2006 mountain bike frame has lots of scratches and defects, but it is still stiff enough. Aluminium frames have shorter life expetency than steel frames had, because aluminium has a tendency to tire, but it can be used without worries for 10 years. If you are really worried, put a sticker over it :) 

Your weight is used for calculating your power to weight ratio (W/kg). Weight of bike/clothes/other gear is not taken into consideration. It is considered that these things weight about the same for every "pro" cyclist. So you should use your own weight because everybody else is doing that. This way you can compare your results with your competition. 

Here is an example of high-end carbon fiber frame with similar geometry = Trek Y Foil. It proved to be unsuccesful design, but low-end bicycle manufacturers copied it anyway (also using cheaper materials and simplified design). 

I would suggest trying another dealer and taking your potential next bike for a spin. They should allow at least ride in their parking lot. Bike sizing is important, do not try to save a buck buying a bike which does not fit. 

Actually, there can be difference, if you are using disc brakes. For practical reasons, you should put the release on opposite side to the brake rotor to avoid accidentaly touching it. First, it may be still hot from braking, when you need to swap the tire, second, your hands can have oil (or your body oil mixed with sweat) on them and that can be bad for the rotor surface and brake pads. On the road bikes it is considered to be a tradition to put them on the left, non drive side (front and back). 

According to wikipedia, hydroforming is a cost-effective way of shaping ductile metals such as aluminum, brass, low alloy steels, stainless steel into lightweight, structurally stiff and strong pieces. In reality, most aluminium frames are made this way. They start with a simple round tube and form it in more suitable shapes. You wil have to look hard to find non-hydroformed frames. 

Last time I had this problem I ended up using pliers+screwdriver to break that washer between cleat and screws. After removing cleat I was able to get screws out with the same pliers. Trying to drill them out was a complete failure for me too. 

Recently I found my own approach: I approach my bicycle from back, put on an wrench/hex key pointing to back and push it down, if needed, with my foot. I used to do this with my bike upside down, but ended up with some scratches on my hands from drivetrain. 

Tacx manufactures some great jockey wheels which are compatible with Shimano/Sram/Campagnolo products. Search for "Tacx Jockey Wheels" in your favourite online bike shop. They come with cartridge bearings which work great before you use them in muddy conditions (MTB, CX). After these heavy conditions I have found then to lock up. In case of a road bike, I would totally reccomend them, the difference when spinngin pedals backwards is noticable. 

cover $URL$ It should be "The Cyclist's Training Bible: A Complete Training Guide for the Competitive Road Cyclist" by Joe Friel. It is considered one of the best books about cycling training, even if you are a mountain biker - endurance training needs to happen on road as you need to maintain reasonable heart rate for lots of training types. The book has been published several times, the most recent edition in June 18, 2009 After reading it, you can also read Friels blog. 

There is actually a real gain from this strategy. By rotating 2 (or 3) chains you extend the life of rear cogs (cassette) and it will last all your chains. In case you use one chain, you may need to replace cassette together with chain. As of front cogs, they last longer, but you will get a more even wear. Speaking of drawbacks - regularly taking off your chain you can make your PowerLink (or other brand) a bit more loose and have a higher risk of it failing under a load. 

M. Werner explained the purpose of that model pretty well. If you are worried about buying "too expensive bike", do not be so. If you can afford something, you should not be ashamed of using professional equipment for your own activities. you will enjoy smoother shifting and rides. With expensive bikes comes another problem - you can not leave it outside, even if it is locked to something. 

I am about to get my first carbon bike next spring, it's a MTB with a carbon frame with some aluminium components. What are the things I should do and should not do, to avoid damaging it by improper maintenance? I see other threads here about people having problems with stuck seatposts an other, a compilation of all this knowledge plus additional tips would be welcome. 

UPDATED: There is one local person who does carbon repairs, he claims that he has repaired multiple frames which had been damaged this way. 

In another bicycle discussion forum I encountered a thread about possibility to damage carbon frame by sitting on top tube while stopped. I see some sense in it, as generally tube walls are a lot thinner in the middle to save weight and are not designed for this kind of load. The problem is, I have not seen any warnings from manufacturers about this habit, nor there are stickers on the frame suggesting to not do it. So the question is - Is this a real problem, should I change my habits? 

Anything from Shimano with 8 speeds should work. The problems can only start when your cassete's biggest sprocket is too big (you are well under limit). 

Front chainrings are not called cassette. They are reffered to as chainrings and cranks. You will need a hex key and a special too called crank extractor (or crank puller). Your posted eBay tool is suitable for "real" cassette only. You may need also a tool called chain whip for that. 

It really depends on the type of race. XC marathons include lots of opportunities for drafting on gravel roads etc. But usually there is no such thing as peloton there, just small groups of riders. Other way of helping is carrying tools or food for your lead racer. In case he has a mechanical, you are just some minute behind. In general MTB teams are used for organized training rides, logistics with only minor help for other team members during the race. It is also easier to get a sponsorship for a team instead of individual. 

You should not worry - You can shift to an easier gear and work on your fitness. This is what the smaller rings at front are for. You will get more watts later. I am having the opposite problem - I have rollers and I am turning cranks at 110 rpm and this gives me resistance around my threshold power for an hour. 

There is $URL$ but it does not have Movescout support yet. There is voting page for new services: $URL$ 

Your bike has aluminium frame, it can not suffer from rust. There is such thing as aluminium corrosion, but it is a very slow process, you bike will be fine for years. But, of course, you better cover the holes. Cheap solution is a piece of tape, but you can either buy a bottle cage or any screws that fit there. 

There is no need to have equal tires on both wheels, except for aesthetics. Just make sure that front tire has enough grip so you can remain in control. As for getting pinch flats - make sure you mount tubes correctly and they are not trapped between tire and rim. Having high pressure should help you avoid pinches. More durable tire will help with punctures, not with pinch flats. P.S. My own experience is limited to MTB XC marathons. 

According to another oval chainring maker, Osymetric, the Bio-Pace folks got it wrong by placing crank in line with the large edges of the chainring. According to them, with Bio-Pace you actually lost power. So their own recommendation is to assemble crank aligned with the shortest of diameters. Read on about Osymetric: $URL$ 

It might not be the case here, as it states that problems have been for months, but last summer I had a similar problem, except that the belt was working perfectly. The problem was caused by overtraining and my body was not able to give more than 165 bpm at maximum effort. A few rest days solved the problem. After that I paid more attention to rest and food intake directly after the ride.
