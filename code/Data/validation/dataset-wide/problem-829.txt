There are two issues: Would there be gravitational waves to be detected and would LIGO detect them. On the first issue, gravitational waves are quadrupolar, and a cylindrically symmetric system will not produce any. (Specifically, the second time derivative of the quadrupole moment of an isolated system's stressâ€“energy tensor must be non-zero in order for it to emit gravitational radiation.) So a head-on collision of equally massive black holes would not produce significant gravitational waves. If the BHs were of different masses, or the collision not quite head-on, gravitational waves would be produced. On the second issue there are at least three ways LIGO might might miss them. First, they might simply be too faint. A merger through rotation is one of the best ways to produce gravitational waves, and a head-on collision is one of the worst (during a BH merger, of course). A second way it might miss is if the merger is in one of its blind spots. Each LIGO detector has blind spots and there's no rule that says a BH merger can't be in one of them. (In fact, the neutron star merger was located by use of the blind spots. The third gravitational wave (GW) detector, Virgo, in Italy, didn't pick up the neutron star merger. It was bright/loud enough that it should have, which meant that the merger was in one of Virgo's blind spots, which helped to narrow down its location. A GW detected in only one detector would be listed as a possible GW, but not as a detection, because it might simply be terrestrial interference. But another way it might miss is if LIGO had not been looking for the waveform of that kind of merger. General Relativity allows us to compute in very good detail the GW signal from any type of collision that we think likely. Because the GW signals are so faint, the first step of detection is matching computed GW waveforms to the data and looking for matches. Once a match is found, the signal is analyzed in more detail, but they have to know where to look. If no one expected the waveform and it was not strong enough to pop out of the data and yell "Here I am, dummy!" it might be missed. Since head-on collisions are expected to be very rare, it's possible that they are not in the library of waveforms that LIGO checks. 

This effect is called libration - and it is an oscillating motion of orbiting bodies relative to each other (from Wikipedia) It is down to three factors: 

Our sun is a particularly average sized star on the main sequence. It is not going to ever go "supernova" but instead will slowly swell and darken towards red, eventually swallowing Mercury and Venus. 

This is really simple once you get it: The usual analogy here is to look at the surface of a balloon (which is a surface in 3D space, rather than 3D space itself, but the analogy still works) A partially inflated balloon has tight curvature, but as it is inflated, the curve decreases - the surface at any point becomes 'flatter' From an article on this topic on scienceblogs.com: 

Your premise is incorrect: The external observer's view does not imply anything about an observer within the event horizon. The event horizon itself is just an indicator of the edge of the region where light can no longer escape. Light can head inwards as you would expect. So an observer inside the event horizon will be able to see light reaching them as normal (well, not exactly as normal, as there will be lensing effects) - there will not be an infinite amount of time visible. 

The CMB is nearly featureless, but the operative word is nearly. The tiny temperature fluctuations that we've measured should look about the same anywhere within tens to hundreds of millions of light years of Earth or so. This would allow you to get an absolute orientation relative to the CMB and thus relative to Earth. It's fairly easy to measure velocity relative to the CMB, so if you measure your velocity relative to the CMB somewhere else (within that 10-100 million lightyears of Earth, anyway) and if you know your orientation, you can compute your velocity relative to Earth. But I don't see any way to easily measure the distance from Earth except very approximately. (The CMB that you see from any point is different because it comes from a different sphere. If you move far enough from Earth, the temperature fluctuations you see are no longer the ones we see from Earth because you're sampling a different part of the 300-year-old universe.) Later: I've been thinking about the position problem and there's a solution, but it's complicated. The CMB samples the universe of 13.7 billion years ago and from any point in it see the distribution of matter in a shell that old. If we move to another point, in effect, the shell shifts also and samples different parts of the gas. The key point is that the faint ripples in the gas's temperature that we see as mottling in the CMB are three-dimensional bubbles. So if you shift a short distance in space, the CMB will shift the most in the direction of motion (both in front and behind) and the least at right angles. Furthermore, the amount of shift will depend on the angular size of the fluctuation you're looking at. Low-angular-frequency fluctuations come from physically large ripples int he gas and you need to move a long distance to move the shell you are sampling out of the bubble. High-angular-frequencies ripples come from smaller bubbles and shorter shifts in position will take the shell you observe out of one bubble and into another. Waving my hands just a tiny bit, it should be possible to use statistical methods to estimate the amount and direction of movement by comparing two detailed CMB maps. A major limitation of the method is that the finer the angular resolution, the sooner you lose all correlation between the two views fo the CMB, but the coarser the angular resolution, the coarser your measurement will be. Numbers? As long as we're not talking about jaunteing many billions of light years, we can ignore general relativistic issues. A fluctuation with an angular size of 1 degree corresponds to a CMB fluctuation which appears to us right now to be around 250 million light years across and consequently ought have a good chance to be visible for moves within roughly that distance. This suggests that the CMB method ought to be able to give you a rough position up to maybe a half-billion or even a billion light years, but will drop off rapidly in accuracy after that. Note that for shorter hops, it ought to be possible to actually recognize galaxy super-clusters and get a position that way. 

Unlike all other meteor showers, which originate from comets, Geminids originate from asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Seeing a large number of meteors last night, I noticed they seemed to be much more green than other meteors, but is there anything else I should expect to see different to other meteor showers? Brightness, size, length of trail etc? 

This question isn't really very clear or practical. You need to add quite a bit of information, eg which planet? 

The gravitational pull of all the planets and the sun, and the rest of the galaxy and the universe, all play a part, but gravitational effects fall off with distance. For Earth's orbit, the Sun is far and away the single biggest influence. Jupiter perturbs our orbit slightly, but with it or without it we have a simple elliptical orbit round the sun. We can measure the perturbation in our orbit from all the planets, but the effects are minor. When it comes to gravitational effects on small bodies passing one of the planets, however, the effects can be dramatic - an asteroid passing close to Jupiter will be moved far from its original path. The same would be true when passing close to Saturn or in fact any planet - just to a lesser degree. So while you can't say that Jupiter protects Earth from anything, especially not the Oort Cloud, you also can't say that it draws objects in. Anything out in the Kuiper belt or Oort cloud will be orbiting the barycentre of the solar system (which is within the Sun) and will keep doing that unless knocked out by something like a collision with another object, or the pull of other Kuiper belt objects like Pluto, which can give a much greater tug. 

First of all, at that distance seeing the Moon and seeing the Earth amounts to the same thing. At its closest, Saturn is around 3000 times as far from Earth as the Moon is, so viewed from Saturn, the Moon is never more than about a minute of arc away from the Earth. If you can see Earth from the North Pole of Saturn, you can see the Moon, also. (Though it would be a lot dimmer.) But if you can See the Earth from Saturn's pole, then you can also see Saturn's pole from Earth. So your question can equally well be phrased as "Can Saturn's north pole be seen from Earth and if so, when?" If you look at pictures of Saturn from Earth, the rings are sometimes tilted so far that they cover one polar region, though it's also true at those times that polar region tilted away from Earth, anyway! Most of the time the rings are either not tilted enough to cover the poles or tilted to cover the south pole. So the answer is that during most of Saturn's orbit around the Sun, the rings would not obscure the sightline from Saturn's north pole to the Moon. 

Even on Earth, we say that a day is 24 hours, but it isn't really, as the two sets of concepts don't match up. We haven't defined a second as a fraction of the time it takes the planet to rotate - it is defined based on physical constants. So if you were to say that Gliesa has a day that is 30 units long - it would be astonishing if those units were exactly hours! 

If you are a beginning astronomer, there is not much point worrying about all the bells and whistles you can get with a good telescope. Instead, the key points to look for are: 

This question has two parts: Surface Temperatures A very useful diagram which shows surface temperatures, and also gives you the temperature of any star you can observe is the Herzsprung-Russell Diagram, this one from le.ac.uk. 

This comes from a misunderstanding of local and absolute. There is nothing to prevent a local increase in order - overall, order still decreases (or in common terminology, entropy increases) From Wikipedia: 

The total energy of the universe consists of the mass energy of all the matter (both normal and dark), the mass-energy of the radiation and of the dark energy plus the gravitational potential energy of the universe (which is negative). The hypotheses is that this sums to zero. As far as I know, there is no experimental evidence for this. But there is good evidence for the size of the various mass-energy terms. The best current estimates are that the mass-energy of the universe is: 

The Wikipedia article says that Spica A has 8 times the luminosity of Spica B (presumably that's at maximum.) Magnitude is -2.5*log10(I/I0). So if the combined magnitude is 0.97, the magnitude of component A is ~1.1 and the magnitude of component B is ~3.3. 

I'm not sure what you mean by "nebulae". You could mean "matter in a gaseous or plasma state" or "cloud of low density gas and dust in space" (which is what astronomers mean by nebulae.) The former case is believed to be correct, and it pretty well described in Wikipedia. I'll summarize. Immediately after the Big Bang (10-20 seconds or so) the universe was full of extremely hot and extremely dense matter -- hot enough that not only did atoms come apart, and nuclei come apart, but even protons and neutrons came apart into a quark-gluon plasma. This cooled into a stew of elementary particles, which cooled into mostly protons, neutrons and electrons, which cooled partly into nuclei. At this point we're maybe a minute into the expansion and the universe was full of a plasma that was still hotter than the center of a star. After around 300,000 years, the plasma cooled enough to recombined into atoms. Stars eventually started to form. No astronomer would call any stage of this expansion a "nebula" -- they first formed later after the atomic gas left a milion years after the Big Bang started to condense into stars and patches of gas and patches close to vacuum. Bottom line: Nebulae did not exist until millions of years after the Big Bang, but the universe was filled with hot gas much earlier in the Big Bang. 

There are different infinities. You could say that there are an infinite number of planets, so probability says that there could be humans on a small percentage of them. Say for arguments sake humans exist on 0.001% of those planets.0.001% of infinity is infinity, right? Well, sort of, but it's obviously a smaller infinity than the number of planets. Conversely there are 99.999% of planets without humans, which is a much bigger infinity. So to all intents and purposes the answer is no, for this mental exercise. And in reality it's a no, as any humans on other planets would pretty much have to not be humans any more, as they are so far away that unless we have instantaneous or FTL travel, evolution would have changed them/us. 

Of course Earth life would be fine at first (unless it was Earth that was removed ...) but the orbits of asteroids and other bodies may be perturbed, which could lead to an influx of asteroid strikes - potentially - in the longer term. 

This is unpredictable. The solar system is a chaotic system and it's long-term behavior can't be predicted. But it's also a very stable chaotic system and the planetary orbits have been stable for 4 billion years and will remain stable for some millions of years into the future. See the Wikipedia article for an overview. When we numerically integrate the orbits of the planets into the future in an ensemble (doing many integrations, each with small differences in starting values that are still within experimental error), a small fraction of the ensemble members diverge chaotically. (E.g., Mercury is eventually flung into a wild orbit which may impact Venus.) The key point here is that it is intrinsically unpredictable more than some millions of years into the future -- we're definitely safe for much more than a thousand human lifetimes -- other than statistically. But base don those statistics, it seems likely that the solar system will be disrupted due to chaotic dynamics before the Earth's orbit decays due to tidal forces or anything like that. (Another presently unpredictable future is an interloping star coming close enough to disrupt planetary orbits. Stars pass through the Oort cloud on a regular basis -- one each million years or so -- but getting inside the orbit of Pluto is much less likely and hasn't happened yet as far as we can tell. Nonetheless, this could happen any time.)
