Tl;dr: Are horns like this known to grow on human heads? Yes. Is this woman's horn in the category known to grow? No idea. Below is documentation demonstrating that these horns do, indeed, grow on people. One can view Google image results for "cutaneous horn" and see similar formations on humans (though this one is on the larger side). What I found below was enough to deflate this (for me personally) from the "I've never seen that! This is wild, is it real?" category to the level of "Oh. It seems like this is not that strange at all and apparently scientists have known about this for a long time." 

US Airways is definitely in this range with their lowest reported figure of $21,600. United airlines is also close at $27,392, with American Airlines coming in at 3rd with $30,984. Based on this survey, YES, some pilots are being paid in the range that Moore reports. 

TL;DR summary: This claim seems overstated in its current form. In short, the subjects in the study cited were primed to hallucinate; they were played a song, then told that the song might be embedded in white noise, and then were played white noise for three minutes and told to push a button whenever they heard fragments of the song. Subjects who self-identified as having high stress and as intaking high amounts of caffeine were found to be more prone to reporting hearing fragments of the song. Thus, yes, those in this group did "hallucinate," but on a practical level, the amounts of publicity this has received (just note how the floodgates open HERE) seem to overstate the conclusion and blow things out of proportion. I personally question whether a primed response even counts as "hallucination" in the same way that some are implying it, such as being connected with psychosis. 

None but the Pennsylvania question seems to have a definitive answer. Is it illegal to sell a [for simplicity's sake, non-stained, not-known-to-be-infested, etc.] used mattress? 

I was actually curious about this, wondering if large farms received a proportional payment per volume of crop compared to small farms. It seems that they actually receive less by value than small farms! The report does give some explanations for the smaller payments to smaller farms, one being the obvious one already mentioned that larger farms produce more product. Another, however, was based on the type of goods typically produced by the farm sizes: 

Following the link to Professor Erik Odeblad's work, I was surprised to find what I considered a much more modest statement (emphasis mine): 

So... what to make of this? It seems that low intensity ultrasound has definite evidence going for it in terms of bone growth stimulation. Also, acoustic shockwaves from the patent are also cited, but my skim showed them referring to frequencies in the ultrasonic range as well (I could have missed something, though). However, a cat purr is not going to use their supplied method of causing bone bleeding. I could find no evidence for the claims that I think would be required to support what you're asking about, thought. Namely, nothing supporting:

Re. Habermas and his claims in particular I emailed the source of these claims, Dr. Habermas, to try and obtain the "list of over one-hundred evidential cases" he refers to in his debates/talks. He did not have such a list (I can provide the exact email if requested). He suggested checking out his book, Beyond Death and other articles/interviews/etc. for more sources. I followed up with a request for a reference to the girl who was underwater for 19 minutes (mentioned in the question, with a video link). He provided a reference to the journal in which the article appeared, the journal, Current Problems in Pediatrics and Adolescent Heath Care. I tracked down the article, available from Dr. Morse's (the author) SITE, available for download HERE. The mention of that case is, indeed, very short and disappointing, which surprised me if Habermas' account of the same girl is correct; compare the amazing story in my question by Habermas with Morse's account here: 

Feel free to differentiate between person-to-person sales vs. via a business if the requirements differ. If, as one of the Wiki answers posts states, this might be state dependent, a summary of which states (or countries) allow/disallow this would be neat to have. 

Let's assume that the kit costs $15 and insulates 5 windows (but 8 windows should be treated like two kits ($30), not $15 kit/5 windows per kit x 8 windows = $24). 

As an entertaining piece of dessert, I recalled James Randi's own Out of Body Experience, found HERE. He "floated" out of his body one night and recounted vivid details to his step-son the next morning (color of bed spread, where his cat was on the bed, and what the cat's eyes looked like), only to find that the specific bedspread was in the laundry and that the cat had been outside all night. Not an NDE, but in listening to him, it sounds like such a "typical" OBE, and it's just so fantastic that Randi of all people experienced it and then learned it was not real. 

Others apparently have not caught on to the fact that this is psuedoscience. Some answers from this Yahoo answers question: 

I've heard this before and anecdotally have thought I've experienced it working, but I thought I'd ask here. Many years ago, someone told me that putting a car remote (unlock/lock/alarm/auto-start) under my chin would increase the effective range and let me control the car from distances that would not work otherwise. It's pretty easy to find others saying the same (SOURCE): 

As Lennart pointed out though, larger farms are, by definition, producing more crops. Subsidies (unsure of units, but say payed per volume or weight), therefore, would be paid in higher proportion to those producing more goods. I did find the chart below, which suggests that small farms may actually be getting more payments per value of their establishments compared to large farms: 

It's long floated around my ears that Disney movies have "adult content" secretly/intentionally "embedded" in their various movies. I've heard examples from Lion King, Aladdin, and the Little Mermaid. There may be others. HERE is another example of such a claim: 

I still have no evidence for soluble fiber binding with Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and/or bile to reduce morning sickness. It's also undetermined exactly how soluble fiber is dealing with cholesterol or bile, at least from my survey. So... it's unclear as to whether Hurd is just speculating or has any basis for her claims. At the very least, I can say that my research surprised me a great deal (due to finding the positive connection with soluble fiber, cholesterol decreases, and increase in bile expulsion rates), but I'm still skeptical about mechanisms and morning sickness. This is all I've found for now. 

I've heard claims of airborne poop particles that fly into the air everytime one flushes a toilet. Here's some examples: 

So, small farms are substantially more targeted toward a non-subsidized product compared to their larger counterparts, and thus aren't receiving subsidies for those goods. It would be great to see more current data on this topic, as the intro to the report states (addressed to the Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture at the time): 

The central quote from the last two is from Charles Gerba, PhD, a professor of microbiology at University of Arizona in Tucson: 

So, my takeaway is that the recommendation is due to materials science factors and degredation of the latex. I don't know that I buy the "pinholes from rubbing" explanation, though I suppose these could come about -- we'd need to know what failure mechanism latex degredation leads to. Pinholes might be it, but it could simply be breakage once the condom is actually used vs. a failure before hand. Not sure! I'll update the answer if I hear back from any other manufacturers I emailed! 

It pretty much just keeps going like that (the volume of alcohol is so small that it barely changes anything through time). For the formulas: 

As a side comment, if evidence/data/studies suggests that parents should hold kids back until they are at least ~5.5 before starting kindergarten, I might expect that this would have become part of school enrollment standards. To date, it appears that it has not been incorporated, hence some skepticism on my part. 

A friend of mine related today, as shocked as I was to hear it, that he heard that every single study that had ever been conducted on second hand smoke effects was flawed. While I was fairly shocked to hear this (if cigarette smoke causes cancer, why would second hand cigarette smoke not cause cancer?), apparently there's others who think this. For example the site: Second hand smoke studies: the hype and deceit 

In googling "the pill ages the cervix", the top link directed me to the potential source of this claim, a page on a site called WOOMB, World Organization Ovulation Method Billings (emphasis mine): 

They also provide power generation data for a wind turbine only vs. one fitted with their diffuser/"lens" device (pg. 639): 

I had no idea. I guess that the recommendations about soluble fiber and cholesterol are true, after all. Even more, I found these: 

Question: Does the pornography industry have higher earnings than the respective combined earnings of US sports franchises, top tech companies, and top broadcasting networks (ABC/NBC/CBS)? 

I wish there were more available test data from this device from external users/organizations. So far, nothing like that. Here's the best I was able to find. Perhaps some independent, controlled tests/reviews will come about down the road. 

So, again we have support for convergence insufficiency (mentioned above), some evidence indicating that regaining depth perception (stereoscopic skills) after brain injury is supported... but overall, nothing supporting the use in other areas (such as improvements in "visual acuity" -- what we typically mean when we say "better vision"). 

So, for long term strategies, it doesn't seem that dark triad high-scorers will fare as well. Across the board, attraction and ambition (or money) influence relationship partner choices a lot, and fertility and the type of mate (long vs. short term) will also affect what about a male is attractive. Hope that doesn't cloud the water too much -- none of these provided quite what I hoped, but I think they are related enough to list as an answer. 

So, in essence, this means that if we have a network of nodes having a distribution of opinions A and B, playing by the rules of the binary agreement model, over time, the majoriby view will win out. But, this study introduced some nodes, say containing belief A, that could influence others, but not be influenced. Rewriting the above table for uninfluencable nodes gives this new variant: 

See the rest of that article for some additional summary information concerning frequency, causes of this phenomenon, and more references. 

I was just sent a YouTube video, which appears to demonstrate that one can determine the "health" of a battery (current voltage, useful lifetime remaining, etc.) by bouncing it on a level surface. 

Someone recently insisted that filling a washing machine to the top doesn't get clothes as clean. My washing machine has water fill levels from "Small" all the way to "Extra Large," but no corresponding lines inside the machine to indicate how high one is supposed to fill the clothes. When I have a lot of clothes, I set it to "Extra Large" and then loosely drop clothes in all the way to the top of the basin. Here are other examples of the claim: 

It appears that there is no readily available source for this claim. Other than claims beginning with the words "It is thought that..." or "It is believed that," I could not find any reputable source for this belief (actually, I couldn't find any source at all except for the hearsay-sounding examples above). TL;DR: I searched Google Books and Amazon for instances of "Bernard Corleone" and "Philip Latini" (pre-monk name) and didn't find any instance of the claim. Below are screen shots of my findings and the summary at the very end lists my interpretation of this lack of mention. 

Cutaneous horns: are these lesions as innocent as they seem to be?, World Journal of Surgical Oncology (emphasis mine): 

So, a quick google search indicates that perhaps 5-12% of Americans might have a thyroid disease, not 33%. Is there evidence to support the claim that actual rates of thyroid disease approach 1 in 3 for Americans? 

I was pitched a multi-level marketing scheme a couple years ago and have been fascinated ever since (as in, the mathematics and how to protect others, not as in a participant). This particular one is called Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing (FHTM). In business presentations (like this one around 2:30) and online material, I've heard that FHTM's founder, Paul Orberson, was involved in a network marketing company previously in his life, and that this is what inspired him to create FHTM. The company was called Excel Communications, and Orberson is said to have shattered sales records left and right and earned more money in less time than anyone in the industry. Specifically, claims are made that he made over $1,000,000 USD per month for 44 months straight before leaving the company. (USA Today has him saying $100,000/month in one of their articles, though there's no stipulation that this was the maximum). Is there any verification for Paul Orberson's sales record with Excel Communication? 

Maybe not the most authoritative source (your call on that), but Luke Meuhlhauser of Common Sense Atheism has read 340 self-help books (LINK) and makes the following statement (SOURCE, emphasis mine): 

I really wanted to answer this in terms of power curves and torque, but could not get my head around enough to put the facts together. I think the real why of this answer would lie in keeping the power output of the transmission (which is the torque of the engine "filtered" through your gear box) matched for the speed of the vehicle. My attempts at digging there tended to come up primarily with "hot rod" types of sites that are primarily focused on maximizing acceleration, not fuel economy.
