In a situation like this, your choice is one between reliability and speed. You can go with RAID 10, which as Sam Cogan pointed out, is a RAID 1 (mirror) of RAID 0 (stripes). This is the higher performance option. As Sam also pointed out, you can lose one disk and still have a good set. Losing a second disk has a 50% chance of causing you data loss, because it's possible to lose one RAID 1 set entirely. If you would rather trade performance for reliability, you can use RAID 6, which reserves 2 drives for parity information. Since you have 4 drives, you would have 2 drives worth of usable space (the same as RAID10, in this case). This is slower than RAID10, but at no time will a loss of 2 disks cause you to lose data. 

I'm taking a look at buying some new servers (small infrastructure, 2 racks, etc), and although I like a lot of the features in blades, I'm looking at the price point for Silicon Mechanics' 4-node machines. $URL$ It's a bit like a mini-blade enclosure, but has no shared resources, except for the redundant power supplies. A single point of management would be great, but for the low price point here, I'm possibly willing to give that up, if the server quality is adequate. Basically, have you used these machines? Any problems? Anything you like? 

I have various services configured to authenticate against Active Directory. It would be very helpful if they all logged authentication failures, but they don't. This makes debugging even a simple "incorrect password" error very frustrating. Is it possible to watch in realtime (or later) authentication attempts against AD? The AD is Windows Server 2003. 

will recreate the directory tree of ./ in which html files are found, and build the same under /target/base/directory 

I bought 3 servers from them probably 3 years ago. 2 servers had the (cheap plastic) rabbit ears break off almost immediately. One server was RMA'd. In terms of operations and not cheap plastic case addons, they've been reliable machines. I've heard their quality has improved from the models I bought. 

Well, that is great, but as for actually DEALING with the certs, I'm apparently out of luck. Of course, I'm not going to give up that easily. I ran "file" on the saved cert bundle and got this: 

What this means is that your MX record HAS to point to an A (or AAAA) record to be valid. If the A record that you want to remove is where your MX is pointed to, then you can't remove it (and expect to get your email) 

or 111 It should be noted that in the command listed above, there's an echo to prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot. Feel free to take of the safety once you'd nailed the files correctly. EDIT OK, this blows away all shell scripts, too. There is no nice, neat way to do it with find that I've found, due to the relatively primitive regular expression matching. I can find all of the .sh files you want using regular expressions: 

Your english isn't too bad, I think everyone will be able to understand. To clarify one thing, do you want the contents of "vg_avdvdfiler-lv_root" to be transferred, or do you want the LVM itself (which might include things like snapshots)? 

Linux should be able to mount UFS easily as read-only. Try modprobe ufs2 if it has trouble mounting it. What distro are you using? 

I don't believe so. I suspect that you would need to make a third group to hold them while you recreate the 12 disk group. If you find out otherwise, it would be great if you came back and answered it so we all learn from it. 

Without knowing whatsoever about the situation, I've got to say, if YOU don't know the underlying impact, you definitely shouldn't do this during general hours. This is the kind of thing labs were invented for. Also maintenance windows. 

According to the current licensing, you'll need OS X server. That's the only legal way to virtualize OS X at the moment: $URL$ Specifically, it requires that it be run on Apple hardware, which almost coincidentally, you are. Bonus. 

What kind of RAID device do you have? Is it a hardware or software RAID (and if so, what OS?) As MarkM mentioned, there's an excellent chance that the degradation is caused by a failed drive. If you've got a hardware raid, you can probably see the bad drive because there will be a different colored LED. If it's software RAID, then you know the port number (port 1, I guess?), but you can cat /proc/mdstat and learn more details about the status of the array. 

So I've got an interesting issue at the moment. I'm attempting to use curl (7.15.5 on CentOS) to retrieve a file from a remote FTP server. Our client changed something last weekend, because it worked on Friday and doesn't now. I can FTP in using the CLI client, and get a directory listing just fine, although I have to issue "passive" to turn passive mode off. If I don't, I get 

It's important to know that if you want people to be able access a directory, the execute bit must be set on all of the parent directories for that particular user. For instance: 

Right now, I've got a Brother P-touch labeler that prints four or five sizes of text on one long label. It has features such as italics and bold. It's...non-ideal. What do you use in your server room? I have heard of labelers that will print vertically as well as horizontally, or which can produce labels for cable management as well. I also think it would be great to be able to produce barcodes for my tapes (LTO-3). So basically, I would like a labeler that prints normal, can print cable labels, and can print barcodes. Unicorn optional. Any ideas, or could you even suggest the best labeler for each solution? 

Assuming that this is a locally authenticated user (as it sounds like it is), you should be able to only change /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, and /etc/group, then mv her old home directory name to the new directory name. That would ensure that she has the same UID as before so no file permission errors will crop up. The only remnants of her old login would exist in log files. 

Autorun ( $URL$ ) takes care of CDs, but I don't think something like that exists for other media. I'm really not of the opinion that it /should/, either. You might be able to craft autorun into looking at dmesg on occasion, but chances are good that it will only work for your pet system. What is your overall goal? Maybe there's a better way? 

I used to have this problem with machines that were attempting to get a DHCP lease. I do not know if this is a problem with XP. 

It might be possible to contact the provider, ask to speak with an engineer, and explain the situation to them. They might be able to help you by pulling their records or configs for you to look at. 

In recent kernels ( > 2.6 ) pretty much all hard drives and hardware RAID devices appear as /dev/sd# If the Promise FastTrack is presenting one logical drive (as in, it's performing the RAID0 or RAID1), then check /dev/sd# You should be able to find it by issuing 'dmesg' 

I second Evan Anderson's suggestion of MPLS. It's the solution that I have considered for my own network. Logically, it's point to cloud, and all the complex routing is done by the provider. This necessitates that you have one unified provider across your entire infrastructure*. This isn't as bad as it might sound, since there's a bit of configuration collaboration to be done between you and your provider. I wouldn't want to do it multiple times. Also, be aware that for not-much-more-than-a-T1, you can get into the metro-ethernet type solutions. This is excellent, even if you start out with something like 5Mb/s, because you can expand in the future without adding more lines. It might not be important in your branches, but it sounds like your "central" location could definitely use more than a T1. Take care to mention that to the providers you are shopping around with. Some of them don't (or at least didn't 2 years ago) mix their T1 and ethernet MPLS clouds. That may or may not be the case now. If I were in your situation, I'd go with a very large provider where you will have the option of connecting your European nodes to the MPLS network as well. There aren't many (or at least there wasn't when I was looking). -* There are 3rd party providers that can bridge the gap between carriers. Essentially they connect to both and manage your connection on both of them. Blargh. 

I'd be willing to bet that it's a lack of reverse DNS. Try disabling reverse DNS lookup in the server and see if that helps. 

It would be normal to show activity for a while after a server was shut down, due to decaching of data. If your array does it indefinitely, it may be trying to auto-arrange data or defragment the array. The documentation probably mentions something like that, and if not, you may want to contact server support for more answers. [EDIT] You've halted the OS. Is there something unusual with having to power off and on the machine? (If the answer is 'the server should power down by itself', then have you turned acpi=off on the kernelline? If that doesn't work, try 'shutdown -hP now') 

I think it depends on what your uptime requirements are, and what level of "grey market" you're dealing with. If your uptime requirements are high, then you want to rely on infrastructure redundancy, so that the loss of a single machine doesn't mean the loss of services to your customers. Buy double, build in redundancy, and monitor your hosts and network so that you know when you need to replace something. If your uptime requirements aren't that high, but you just need working hardware, then evaluate the people you buy from. Don't buy stuff that isn't guaranteed non-DOA. If you can, buy from refurb shops with at least 90 day warranties, though a year would be great if you could afford it, and make sure that you can get spare parts for whatever you're buying from another source if the original closes up. 

I'd also like to answer "blogs". I run Standalone Sysadmin, which sort of caters to small infrastructure sysadmins. I've got around a thousand subscribers and of those, a couple of dozen people who come back again and again to comment and interact with each other. It's great to see. In addition, there is a social network setup specifically for sysadmins, called creatively, The Sysadmin Network. It's devoted to helping sysadmins communicate to each other. Join user groups, join a professional association, like LOPSA, SAGE, and go to (or start) local chapters of the above. I've seen time and time again that there are always more people interested in joining a group than there are people interested in starting a group. Once the momentum is going, people jump on the bandwagon like there's no tomorrow. To advertise your usergroup (or whatever), put ads in papers, local website, local businesses, whatever you've got. Trust me, the people are out there, they just have to be found. Sometimes all it takes to get a group going is to find that one old grizzled sysop that used to run the community BBS. The old BBS people probably got together back in the day, but now that the net is here and the BBSes have died, they don't have a reason. Give them one. 

This sounds relatively complex, if everything you're saying is accurate. Can the VM host send and receive UDP traffic as well? 

The down side? To deduct it from your tax, you've got to make that much first. Until you have a business, and your business insurance covers it, make sure your home/rental insurance covers them. 

When you moved from CompanyA to CompanyB, did you move your database with it? If you did, and it's running and everything, make sure that you updated your application's configuration to point to the new host at CompanyA. If you originally configured it with the IP address instead of domain name, that would explain the symptoms. 

Igor, your question is great, and like so many innocent questions, there are many, many answers, all at different levels of details. The piece of hardware is a web server. Obviously ;-) The piece of hardware is actually a cluster of load balancers, all of which are configured to pull from shared storage so they're all identically configured with identical material. The piece of hardware is actually one of several clusters of load balancers, geographically dispersed, and you were directed to the one closest to you, a decision made by the DNS server. 

This mostly comes into play in things like web servers, where a user will want to present files to the populace in general (typically in ~/public_html for instance) but wants to keep the parent directory secure. There is no need or reason to set the read bit, unless you want your user to be able to execute a directory listing. 

you can run "bg" to run it in the background. "fg" moves it to the foreground Note that bg and fg take job #s instead of PIDs, so if you've got multiple jobs running at once, use the "jobs" command to get the job numbers. 

There are so many solutions out there for document management; are you sure you want to reinvent the wheel? Personally, I'd recommend Knowledge Tree (there's a free community version). If you've got your heart set on web page full of file links, you probably want to do it web-side, so it's dynamic and you don't have to remember to re-run it when you put new files in. Something like the PHP Directory Listing script here might be best: $URL$ 

I can't afford VMware infrastructure to do all the cool things, but I also don't have the money to buy a physical server for each and every machine I need, so I've been implementing some non-core machines with VMware Server. I'm interested in hearing about what other people do with this, and if it's a long-term viable solution, or if I'm just postponing the inevitable migration to ESXi 

Just so you know, there isn't a real answer, as solefald mentioned. We can probably give you a ballpark answer, though, if you give us more details about how many servers you'll have, what they'll be doing, what your uptime requirements are, and the price you're willing to pay for sysadmins vs the rest of the local market.
