According to 'A history of the Korean language' (p 271) the Korean subject particle ka is a recent development in that language, not being attested at all until the sixteenth century, and probably not in common use until the 18th century and thereafter. This means we can rule out the possibility that it is cognate with the Japanese ga (ie they are not similar because they are both inherited from some ancestor to the two languages). Two other possibilities are coincidence or borrowing. Given that there is no known etymological explanation of the development of Korean ka that would show it to be a coincidence, or that would even provide any origin, the rapid development of this particle in Korean suggests it is a borrowing from Japanese. It's worth noting that it has been proposed that the Japanese postposition -i was originally borrowed from Korean, perhaps by the 9th century. 

The easternmost Indo-European language is Assamese, spoken in the extreme east of India. The now extinct Tocharian language (sc. Turfanian) was spoken around Turfan on the north-east side of the Tarim Basin, at around 89º E, as can be seen in this map from WP which shows the major linguistic groupings in the 3rd Century CE: 

These kinds of phonological rules are pretty easy to do with standard LaTeX such as mbox, the array environment, etc. Here's an example (warning to TeXperts, you may find this ugly!): 

According to Pullum and Ladusaw (1986, p185) the glottal stop symbol does originally derive from the use of the actual question mark symbol to indicate a glottal stop. 

The question title asks for ways of defining a writer's unique style, but the body indicates that the aim is to identify authors based on analysis of their writings. The identification of authors based on analysis of their style, known as 'authorship attribution', does not necessarily allow for characterising a 'unique style' as it may be more about statistical differences rather than unique styles. This means that while a human reader may not be able to guess that two pieces were by different authors, statistical calculations based on various measures may be able to detect this with a fair degree of certainty. Authorship attribution has a long tradition, particularly in theological studies and philology, but has developed many new methods with the advent of natural language processing. Many different metrics have been employed in authorship attribution, such as: 

Probably the best online source of information on the geographical distribution of natural languages would be Ethnologue. Ethnologue aims to catalogue all of the world's languages and provides speaker numbers, rough location, family affiliation and other information, along with maps for many areas. Conversely, for every country in the world it lists the main languages that are spoken there, along with an estimate of speaker numbers. It is not designed to be parsed, but it can be. An alternative is the World Language Mapping System, but this is not free and uses a very dodgy language classification scheme (Ruhlen's). Some other sources that deal with restricted subsets of the world's languages are: UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger, AustLang (a complete catalogue of Australian languages), and the forthcoming ELCat. 

I don't think there are many signed or spoken languages with a truly comprehensive reference grammar. The best descriptive grammar that I know of for Auslan is this publication by Adam Schembri The structure and formation of signs in Auslan. More technical works on Auslan by the same author are here. A more general introduction to Auslan is this work by Trevor Johnston. Of course, NZ Sign Language and Auslan are very closely related (both being grouped with British Sign Language as the BANZSL family of sign languages). There is also a description of Yolngu Sign Language, described by the authors as a sketch grammar. 

This is a case where we have to distinguish between the ability to express something in a language and the presence or absence of a grammatical structure dedicated to expressing that something. English does not have a grammatical structure dedicated to expressing the inchoative aspect. But it is still possible to express inchoativity by using the verbs ''become'' or ''get'', or some other means (some of which are outlined in the WP articles referenced by the question). Inchoativity is something that I'm sure all human languages can express, but many do not have a specific grammatical structure dedicated to this usage. Regarding the two passages you quote, they both say the same thing: that English has a variety of grammatical constructions that can be used to indicate inchoative aspect, but there is no particular grammatical construction which can be said to be the 'inchoative aspect'. This amounts to a terminological issue as ''aspect'' can refer to either the meaning expressed or grammatical equipment used to express the meaning. By contrast, in the related domain of modality we have two terms: ''mood'' refers to the distinctive grammatical form/s, while ''modality'' refers to the meaning/s being expressed. Again, all human languages can express all the modalities that humans want to express, but languages vary in how many grammatical moods they have. 

Firstly, I'll assume that the way your first and last names are written reflect the official written standard, the Caighdeán Oifigiúil. This amounts to a single way of writing Gaeilge (Irish) even though it has numerous dialects with quite varied pronunciations. In this system the 'dh' in Aodhán would normally represent a voiced velar fricative (being in a 'broad' context) but I've heard pronunciations that have it as [j] or even elide it altogether. Stress is on the vowel with fada (the accent mark) and that vowel should sound like the one in 'born'. The 'Ao' has a variety of pronunciations, from [i:] to [ei] (and others). You could try something like: Aodhán: [iˈɣɔ:n], [ˈeiˈɣɔ:n] or [iˈjɔ:n], [eiˈjɔ:n] As for your surname, it depends on how precise you want to be: Cearbhaill: [ˈcʲaɾəwɑlʲ] or [ˈcʲaɾəvɑlʲ] The bh can represent either [w] or [v]; note that a brief schwa-like vowel is typically inserted between consonants such as the rbh cluster. If the pronunciation with [w] is preferred in this name then it's not surprising that it would (at speed) surface as how you represent it, i.e. 'KYEARLL... ll as in the -OL in Carol' — nice to see your family has retained the 'slender' (i.e. palatalised) initial consonant! It's likely the case that the majority of speakers of Irish nowadays are those who have learned Standard Irish as a second language. One result of this is that there are many who don't fully acquire aspects such as the velar fricatives and some of the broad/slender variants, as they are found in the unbroken Irish speech lineages. As a result it's not unusual to hear the voiced velar fricative produced as a [g] as this is probably the nearest English equivalent. So you might hear people pronounce your first name as [iˈgɔ:n] or [ˈeiˈgɔ:n]. 

An orthography is a system for writing a language. Ideally an orthography would be developed on the basis of a thorough analysis of the phonology of the language in question. The aim would be to have an unambiguous representation of each phoneme, with a one-to-one correspondence between graphemes and phonemes; this is known as a 'phonemic' or 'shallow' orthography. This can often be very difficult to achieve, but the less ambiguity in the writing system, the easier it seems to be for literacy. Japanese hiragana (not Kanji!) and the Finnish orthography are good examples of shallow orthographies On the other hand there are some languages which have a standard orthography which involves a complex many-to-many relationship between graphemes and phonemes; these are referred to as 'deep' orthographies. English is a fairly well-known language with a deep orthography, which gives rise to the situation where even native speakers may not know how to pronounce a word seen in writing for the first time, or how to write a word heard for the first time. A native (or naive) othography is one developed without being based on an analysis of the phonology. Typicaly it is created by speakers of the language in response to their desire to make written records and will be based on the best-known language that has a standard orthography: for example in Papua New Guinea people may draw on the Tok Pisin orthography. This means that the orthography is not a good match for their language, but it may be good enough that it meets some needs. Examples I've seen are of people wanting to write a song in their language for use in church, or people wanting to write their name, a sign on their house, and other such fairly short texts. I'm not actually aware of the term 'relaxed orthography' but it seems from your link that the webpage is referring to 'relaxed spelling'. Relaxed spelling refers to a situation where there is little prescription of spelling, so it is acceptable for words to be spelled in a variety of ways. English has a deep orthography, which makes numerous spellings potentially possible for most words (eg the famous spelling of 'fish' as ghoti) but relaxed spelling is generally not acceptable, at least in recent times (in the 18th century and earlier, English spelling was very relaxed). The idea of relaxed spelling generally wouldn't be very applicable to languages with a shallow orthography as the spelling is an accurate representative of the pronunciation. 

George Lakoff (1993: 218) suggests that the metaphorical basis of describing time in terms of space is biologically determined: “In our visual systems, we have detectors for motion and detectors for objects/locations. We do not have detectors for time (whatever that could mean). Thus, it makes good biological sense that time should be understood in terms of things and motion.” 

Every language has a lexicon along with grammatical structures of one kind or another which enable its speakers to express every modality that humans wish to express. But languages differ greatly in their formal moods, the number of grammatical structures dedicated to specific modalities (the meanings). While many languages only have a few grammatical expressions of mood, some have many — it's not clear what the upper limit is but this WP page says that Uralic Samoyedic languages have numerous moods, with Nenets having 16, listed here. Of these 16 there are perhaps 10 that could be considered "irrealis", depending on the definition used. But however they are counted, it is likely that Nenets is an extreme outlier with an unusually large set of irrealis moods and so is a possible answer to the question. At the other extreme, languages with the fewest irrealis moods, it has been claimed that English has only one, the subjunctive, which is being gradually replaced by the modal verbs. If this eventuates then the number of irrealis moods (in the strict sense) in English will be zero, surely the lowest number possible. 

Another commonly included tier is a part of speech description for each lexical item (presupposing an analysis of the language). Next this data would be imported into a tool such as Toolbox, FLEx or TshwanaLex. These tools then construct a database of the lexical items. The entry for each item will include the part of speech assignment, the gloss, a fuller definition, and can include many other pieces of information about the entry. These tools typically also enable creating a KWIC (key word in context) concordance which facilitates analysis of the text to discover the full range of meanings and uses of an item. This 'lexical database' will typically be formatted using FOSF (Field-Oriented Standard Format), aka backslash codes, or at least will enable export/import using FOSF. FOSF consists of a backslash '\' combined with an arbitrary alphanumeric string, followed by the information it categorises. A fairly typical if basic entry would look like this (entry for the word 'papa', Western Desert language): 

The only circumstance I'm aware of where absolute synonyms occur is in the situation of name-avoidance taboo. In many Australian languages it is common practice to avoid saying the names of the deceased. This name avoidance (or taboo) practice includes words which are phonologically similar to a deceased person's name, which can result in words in common use also becoming taboo. These taboo words are typically replaced by some other word, or perhaps by one borrowed from another language. These replacement words are used as total synonyms of the word they replace. An example of this is given in Dixon (1980:29), involving the death of a man named Ngayunya. This led to proscription of the first singular pronoun ngayu and its replacement with nganku, drawn from the mother-in-law avoidance speech style. As the death name taboo applies most particularly to speech with, and in the presence of, relatives of the deceased, both terms were at all times in use by at least some members of the community.
