The traditional answer in Tibetan Mahayana (esp. in Gelug) is that for certain personality types, Liberation from suffering requires deep intellectual understanding of, and liberation from, one's own conceptual obscurations (kleshas). In other words, some people are just not satisfied by a simple statement like "there is no self or core in anything", they need to really see it in detail before they can internalize it and therefore let go of grasping. So Madhyamaka systematically shows examples of this statement and analyses them in great detail, until the person is not only convinced, but his/her very vision of life in all its aspects changes in light of this deep realization. In my own practice, I started getting first glimpses of what "corelessness" could mean way before I officially studied Madhyamaka, picking it up from casual remarks from teachers and books. I must say, seeing how deep the habit of reification goes in everything we humans do, has changed my perspective and attitude dramatically. Nearly every frustration we face in our personal lives as well as in our public social discourse, can be traced to, or is made difficult by, mistaken reification somewhere up the chain. Buddha himself said: 

"The Collected Works of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa" in eight volumes. Brings together the writings of one of the first and most influential and inspirational Tibetan teachers to present Buddhism in the West. 

They are assembled from parts. They are assembled by the coming together of direct causes and ambient conditions necessary for their arising and preventing their disintegration. They are assembled by the mind providing a context/perspective and delineating them from other adjacent phenomena, in accordance with some organizational principle. 

An example of the first kind is attachment to certain flavor, like the taste of some food cooked in a particular way. Even if one can't find this specific cooking style, one can find fairly similar kinds - and the resulting aversion to other flavors will not be that strong. In this case suffering generated by this attachment is both weak and small-scale (only applies to one small area of experience). An example of the second kind is attachment to one's own life. Here the contrast between living and dying is very high, but the scale of identification is rather small. So even if one's fight for survival manifested as external violence it would unlikely create a world-scale conflict - so the suffering will be strong but not vast. The third type can be explained on the example of attachment to gender identity. In this case the scale of attachment is massive - one identifies oneself with "I like men" or "I like women", but the contrast between the two is not polarized enough -- not black and white enough -- to create a major issue, like a war between genders. There are certainly some very common tensions between genders (can we call this "very weak but vast suffering"?), but very few women would say that men are harmful and should not exist - and vice versa. Finally the fourth type is attachment to an abstract and highly polarized view or principle that is very prone to emergence of group identity - such attachment to religion. In this case the contrast between "good" and "bad" is very high - the carriers of the other view are considered harmful and evil. And the scale of identification is very large - all carriers of the same view are considered "us" and all carriers of the other view are "them". This results in a very explosive combination of "good us" vs. "evil them" - hence strong and vast suffering. And then of course there are all kinds of intermediate qualities between "strong" and "weak" and between "small" and "large". In your example, the difference is in the real object of attachment. If the reason you attach to an old childhood friendship is because it exemplifies some abstract quality that your old friend possessed that you now idealize (and on this basis cultivate aversion to those lacking such quality) - than that could be a fairly dangerous attachment. On the other hand, if attachment to old childhood friend is solely on the basis of her beautiful voice - then it's not such a big deal. Similarly, if attachment to wealth is on the basis of simple idea that wealth gives one access to comfort and material pleasures - then it may be a medium-contrast/medium-scale problem. But if attachment to wealth is part an abstract view that all wealthy people are smart and hard-working and poor people are lazy and immoral, - then it could be feeding a global-scale conflict. To summarize, whenever you want to evaluate an attachment you should - identify the real object of attachment, the root of attachment (aka the preconception) - assess the degree of polarization between the object of attachment and its opposite - assess the scale of identification and the size of the potential conflict As a rule of thumb, watch out for abstract and highly polarizing attachments - they tend to create the strongest and largest-scale suffering. 

Oh no, no eating candy after meditation :))) What I meant by "enjoying" is not superficial type of pleasure. It is the deep satisfaction of proceeding slowly, cutting off distractions, focusing, and doing something right. This deep satisfaction is not the same as superficial pleasure. I suspect it is even different hormones on the chemical level. One is dopamine and the other is serotonin, I guess. You can see it if you try physical exercise. It feels difficult and painful on the surface, but if you don't rush and carry it through with slow determination, it gives you a deeper kind of satisfaction. At least that's been my experience. As I said in my answer about energy, you can get satisfaction from keeping your house in order. Same way, you can get it from not rushing as you walk and maintaining good grace and posture, -- and(!) and(!) -- you can get it from mental hygiene. When you maintain mind that is stable, calm, observing everything with analysis and acceptance. Your motivation to practice is inside you. Your real desires and values are inside you. You just need to stop "lying" to yourself. Then your practice will come from the inner source of truth, not from the books. 

Specifically of auto-biographies, I enjoyed Confession of a Buddhist Atheist by Stephen Batchelor and of course Born In Tibet by Chogyam Trungpa Of biographies, Life of Milarepa, even if mythical, remains an inspiring life story. 

My recommendation is to meditate on the notion of entity. Think about a piece of wood and how it becomes ashes as it burns. Where are the spatial/temporal boundaries of an entity here? Same with ice/water/vapor. Same with an entity called "a river". Same with people, including both body and mind. Where does the mind come from? Where are its boundaries? Is there an entity here? 

You have about five minutes left on the timer, so you can either finish your meditation properly and then act, or choose to interrupt the session. What teachings are relevant in this case? What should I do, according to Dharma, and why? 

Because of the immense depth of the teaching, different skillsets/levels of students, and complexity/multidimensionallity of life in general, Buddhist theory and practice is a set of incremental approximations, from very coarse to more refined and precise. The provisional teachings are formulated in the narrative that makes sense to each particular student, such as the eastern religious narrative, or the narrative of shamanic mysticism, or the narrative of the mainstream society. More advanced teachings make use of the phenomenological narrative, the narrative of the subtle energies, and others. Some of the very advanced teachings require stepping outside of all narratives. Since all people are different, all operate in different contexts, it is very difficult to make universal statements that mean the same thing to all people, have the motivating/inspiring effect in all the different contexts, and generally lead to positive outcomes in all of the endless "realities" (personal narratives). The precepts are the lowest common denominator designed to work in all these different worlds. That is, they are meant to be the basic rule of thumb that works well enough regardless of the exact interpretation. As individual practitioner, your understanding of precepts and of Dharma in general grows and matures - and transforms - during the entire journey. This is known as the transmutation of vows.
