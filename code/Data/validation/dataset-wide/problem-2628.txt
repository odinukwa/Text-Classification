An emptiness clearly has a size. The degree to which something can move obviously depends upon the size of the emptiness into which it will be moving. So it is not devoid of properties, and has some aspects of being. Thus it is not an example of being and not being at the same time. 

I think there is an equally strong thread in the Tractatus that supports phenomenology. There is a theme that some valuable insights cannot be said, but can only be shown. This is a move back away from abstract logical constructions toward and the whole apparatus of perception. His 'shown', 'pictured', etc. should not be taken too literally, it would include hearing, etc., as well as the real experience of being in various mental conditions and of going through various mental 'motions'. Climbing up the ladder and feeling the need to toss it aside is one. These are the elements of phenomenology. And he is suggesting that logic be grounded in them, since it cannot stand on its own. His later notions about language-games are deeply embedded in real experience as an escape from the cage of grammar and the delusions implicit in questions that disrespect the boundaries between different realms of experience. So I think Wittgenstein is accepting of phenomenological positions, and could even be classified as in this tradition, just not as fundamentalist about it as someone like Husserl. 

I want to answer this both yes and no. From an important point of view, ethics is a modal logic. One reason we feel we can share moral perspectives at all is that they appear to combine according to logical rules somewhat similar to the rules in more abstract logical situation. There are rules like 'should implies can' -- that we cannot ethically demand someone to do the impossible. There is an expectation of limited transitivity -- that what is morally worse than something already immoral should not be moral. Etc., etc., etc. I would claim that in order to be subject to moral scrutiny any actor should be able to process that logic, either intuitively or formally, and that those who cannot do so are beyond our ability to judge. No toddler is immoral. We must assume our imaginary actors are not insane in the moral sense -- that they can know right from wrong on a basic level and it matters to them. So yes, they have to be logical in a given sense. But no. None of the examples you give fall in that category. Even if I am bound to get caught, if it gives me a sliver of hope in a bleak enough time, I am tempted to do quite dangerous things. That is not crazy, it just serves motives other than survival: true love, religious fervor, abject desperation, consuming hatred, or some other emotion that cannot be put aside with the full force of real fear. Consequences are compared individually, by all sorts of different people -- and the consequence of forgoing an option that would reduce the chance the wife's risk of death by 0.1% may be more severe for Heinz personally than the 99.9% risk of his own death. Those kinds of people, subject to such broad controlling passions do have to fit into whatever solution you want to give. This inability to really read another person's mind and do the math on their emotional comparisons is one of the reasons people have often tried to devise ethical systems that are not directly tied to predicting consequences -- every individual perceives consequences through the lens of their emotional constitution. So comparisons between them are never objective. 

I am basically following up @LuisHenrique, but sandwiching the argument between two recognized 20th-century theories of meaning. We might create a word like 'Beyoncesque' on the pattern of other words like 'Shavian' or 'Rubenesque' that captured the effects of other artists in other periods. It would bear no meaning twenty years ago. Hopefully, it will bear no meaning again in a few years, except to past fans of an erstwhile celebrity, and when they are dead, it will again have no meaning. So the word itself does not hold meaning. Life and context hold meaning, and the word merely channels it. One modern way of resolving this whole thing is to look at language as a political process, rather than as a repository of meaning. Human beings are the repository of meaning, and we transmit meaning through interactions that transfer power. Language is one of these kinds of interactions. But since some part of the process is about power, there is competition built into it, and it tries to optimize itself. In the terminology of Wittgenstein, all interactive thinking takes place via semi-formal exchanges he calls 'language games'. We say things, and those things are linked to other things already said, but not directly, only by association. But by association they convey meaning, since the other things already said were intended to convey meaning. (By this notion, for instance, the first meaningful grunt did not effectively convey meaning until it had occurred many times in relevant contexts, probably for some anatomical reason. Then it acquired meaning by evoking the relevance of those contexts to this one. Language then begins when meaning becomes intentional, rather than simply referential.) Adding to that a Critical Theory take, meaning is knowledge, which has power. So we (being engineering animals, obsessed with power and efficiency) maintain the efficiency of language games' ability to convey meaning by constantly tuning the system, diminishing the effects of communications that are about unimportant things and increasing the effects of communications that are about important things, according to the continual power dynamics that determine what is 'important' and 'unimportant' to the society using the language over time. 

It would be a terrible disaster if philosophy lost any of its forms of presentation, from Dialog, to Aphoristic, to Mathematical, to Historical, to Polemic, this one, which I guess I would describe as Contrastive. The form in Philosophical Investigations is good for what it is good for, wending your way through ground that has been covered by many people before you, but which is not converging toward a single solution. But there are a lot of times where you want to simply lay out your own view, not compare it to everyone else's, and let the community compare and contrast alternatives on its own terms. Wittgenstein was a grand master of detail, and he was very unattached and even-handed. So he could honestly present most contrasting views, without accidentally skewing too much. Most people should not write this way, because they are not him. Someone like Feyerabend, or Neitsche, for instance, gains a great deal of clarity in presentation by degrading and lampooning their adversaries, showing how their particular perspective shows light where it was absent, without expecting folks to read only their take, and truly believe everyone else is a fool. Socrates had the same gift in many Dialogs. And there is little point in multiple people laying out one another's opinions in the long run, unless there is an undue quantity of confusion around things. Language usage is something that eternally spews confusion, so doing it once in a while is a great service to the discipline, but if this style of presentation became the norm, philosophy in general could become offensively redundant and onerous to address. Bertrand Russel went about the same thing a totally different way. He wrote a number of books from different, clear perspectives, that all contradict. This is more reasonable, in my opinion, if it makes him look very strange in the end, when you try to take all of his work as an integrated whole.
