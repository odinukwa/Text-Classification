Highly probable. The strong tides will make your planet extremely geologically active. Assuming it is a somewhat earthlike planet, this means lots of volcanic activity and continental drift with land masses forming, breaking up and perhaps reforming again. This will put a lot of selective pressures on any lifeforms and leading to rapid evolution. All of which will increase the likelihood of a sapient species eventually arising. It would be an interesting planet. If it has a strong magnetic field, taking into account Joe's salutory advice, it should enjoy almost continuous auroral displays. Considering it is most likely tidal locked to its parent gas giant. Night and day will shift according to the planet's position in its orbit, with auroras most visible during its nights. If there isn't a strong magnetic field, there may be fluorescence in the upper atmosphere due to the radiation belts. However, because of the radiation, which does provide another energy gradient, this will change the biochemistry of any life on your super-Io significantly and it won't compatible with our molecular biological history. Don't eat the local food it may harm you. Evolution will tend to favour radiation-resist organisms. Intelligent life is not impossible on super-Io planet. Expect beautiful night skies with the best auroras in the business, the ground will be shaking and quaking with seismic activity, and there will be volcanoes almost everywhere. The perfect place for a vulcanologist on a sabbatical.

Colour, of course, has little to do with laser weapons. Movies and tv use different laser colours so us poor benighted viewers can know whose shooting who. The good guys' lasers are purple and the bad hats is yellow (for example). Again colour would have little to do with most effective space combat laser weapons. The laser weapons would be operating in the x-ray spectrum for optimal destructive power. The reason why is simple. The wavelength of x-rays is effectively the same as the inter-atomic distances of solid matter. An x-ray laser beam weapon would be almost perfect at destroying spacecraft hulls. This doesn't mean developing x-ray laser weapons is a certainty. There are formidable technical problems to be overcome and solved first. These may be the weapons of the not so near-future. But if they could be built, they would be the weapons of choice for space combat. 

The time delay is due to the superluminal message travelling back and forth between your location and spacecraft you are contacting. Communications in this scenario requires both parties to be at relative with respect to each other. This can only be done if both you and the ship have agreed in advance when you will communicate with each other. There is almost no point in either party simply deciding to call without prior arrangement. (1) The usual solution used to resolve causality violation problems is the preferred frame of reference. Vide @JDlugosz's answer for this model. However, there is another resolution, but isn't used commonly, because it isn't easy to wrap our heads around. Essentially superluminal messages travelling backwards in time when they are received they do not come from our future. Instead they come from the future of another worldline (effectively parallel timelines) and this thereby circumvents any causality problems. Causality sequences of events can't be violated, but they can be initiated. This is exactly like the branching timelines model of time travel that also avoids causality violation. Anyone receiving a reply to their initial message will receive that reply before they send their message, but that reply will come from another future. In fact, because the number of worldlines will be large. There won't simply be one reply, there will be a veritable torrent of them. The problem for the receiver is working out which message is the most useful. Their best approach would be to do a statistical analysis of all messages to work out what is the most probable set of circumstances that is the subject of the message. If there is only one worldline, then the CPP will manifest itself as the Novikov self-consistency principleNovikov self-consistency principle. The universe will be deterministic. Even if you know the future you will still send the same message, anyway, the reply will come back, into your past, unchanged. Basically there are an infinite number of pathways to achieve the same set of events (always). Also, this model turns the interpretation of backwards in time processes on their head. This isn't causality violation it is now retrocausality. We are accustomed to causality be about event A causes an event B to happen in its future. With retrocausality event D causes an event E to happen in its past. This starts getting quite confusing when both causal processes are working together in the universe. This usually is resolved as a form of determinism. Again this is Novikov self-consistency. Finally there is the Antippa Corridor solution where superluminal travel and communications can only go in one direction. If you send a superluminal message to a ship they can't reply with a superluminal message. Any reply can only be send at lightspeed or slower than lightspeed velocities. In which case, you won't need to worry about causality violation of any kind. The Antippa model would allow one way superlumninal messaging. The geometric shape where FTL messages can be send will be in the half-circle (actually it's a half-sphere in three dimensions) in the direction where tachyons can travel. The ship can only receive messages but cannot reply. You can only send messages to ships within ninety degrees of the tachyon unidirection. There will be an increasing difficulty in sending messages as the width of the angle of sending superluminal approaches ninety degrees. (1) Almost no point, there might be communications systems set up so if the ship decelerated to relative rest with FTL communications station that could be always listening for messages. You could always accelerate in a vehicle to match the relativistic velocity of the ship you are trying to contact. 

The Sphinxes have opposable thumbs which suggests they have the capacity for tool-making. Please remember it took a long time for the human species to develop tools and culture. Neanderthals remained at around the same level of palaeolithic technology and culture and modern humans were only able to progress to the neolithic level once they had acquired language and the ability to cook their food. Cooking ensured they had more energy to grow bigger brains. Cats and dogs are capable of sitting of their hindquarters. Presumably if they had opposable thumbs, they begin the long process of acquiring the skills and abilities to make things like tools. This answer recommends your Sphinxes need a capacity for language, to develop the art of cooking, and stronger hindquarters for sitting and working. Any observation of tool-makers indicates they do this mostly sitting down. Otherwise your Sphinxes might reach a Neanderthal neolithic technological plateau and develop no further. 

There are no relativistic effects. This is a pedantic answer directly addressing the OP's question. The encoded information is effectively a snap shot of the person. A snap shot image doesn't experience anything. It's simply a signal travelling across interstellar space. The person is simply reconstituted from the information in the encoded signal. The only effects could be due to the method of transmission. Errors creeping in caused by distortions to the signal as it travels to its destination. The other sources of error can occur are during processing the information of the person prior to their disposal and transmission and during their reconstitution. These are only problems of a teleportation system of this sort. Paradoxically this form of teleportation is often called 'matter transmission' yet no matter is transmitted only information. Matter at the transmission stays put and matter at the receiving end is assembled to recreate the traveller. 

"The aliens need to keep the planet around the supernova. In fact, they are interested in this planet exactly because the star will explode as a supernova." This suggests that if the aliens want to keep their planet in orbit around a supernova they must have (a) a good reason for doing so, and (b) some way of using this to their own advantage. What (b) suggests is that the aliens already possess the technological means to save their planet. This message is just a test to see how smart we are. Basically it's a trick question. To determine if we can work out that they don't need our answer to save their planet. OK, aliens if you can do it, then just do it and stop pestering us poor Solar3alings for no good reason. 

They will use taxonomy. It's a centuries-old science, used to identify species. First, they examine specimens of the organism, try to see whether it matches known species, and then use molecular biological assay techniques to further identify, if needed, its place in evolutionary history. This is normal science. Nothing fancy at all. In the comments it is noted that this question doesn't need thehard-science to answer it. This is not a hard-science answer accordingly. 

Since the OP is looking for the broadest term to describe shape-shifters or shape-changers affected by the phases of the Moon, it is necessary to devise a suitable technical or academic term to describe the condition. Specifically, in the case of werewolves were a person will transform into a wolf at the full Moon. Please note the "were" part of werewolf means "man" (which can include women too, so it effectively is "person"). Academicians and technical persons dealing with this range of condition will amke the obvious connection between the phases of the Moon and the shapeshifting. This suggests they will prefer a general term such as "lunamorph". Now this literally means "moon-shape" which is reasonable considering the persons with this condition will take on a specified shape at the full Moon. Please note: "lunamorph" is a Graeco-Roman hybrid word and Classic linguistic purists often disdain their usage. If the term was fully Greek in its etymology, it would be "selenamorph" while its Latin equivalent could be either "lunamutant" or "lunatransformer". It is the opinion of this answer that lunamorph comes more pleasantly off the tongue and because it is easier to say the word lunamorph should be the preferred term for the general class of lunar shapeshifters. 

What makes this question relevant to Worldbuilding SE is that it concerns what strategy would be adopted by the human species in face of an implacable, vastly superior alien civilization that is quite annihilating humanity but refrains from doing so while remaining within its own borders. The querent has suggested a de facto Cold War situation exists between the aliens and humans. The Cold War was a competition for dominance between two global Super Powers. It was a contest for ideology, political influence and economic control of resources. The situation with the querent's aliens seems more than like of Traditional China, before the nineteenth century, where China was a massive self-sufficient economic, social and political empire that needed virtually nothing from the rest of the world. There are comparisons with Japan of the Meiji era. But this seems to be the reverse of that, where humans are playing the role of a Japan ignored by the rest of the world and fearful about when the black ships will arrive. It sounds like the humans could simply continue with their own affairs and ignore this potential existential threat. However, it can be expected that wiser heads will prevail within the inner councils of government, academia, political and economic institutions. They will ponder how the human species can thrive and survive in a future that could easily be blighted by the slightest hostile move from the superior alien civilization. There are several strategies they can adopt. Expand human territory in directions away from the alien sphere of influence. Engage in a massive program of research and development to implement, eventually, weapons, vehicles, communications, power systems, and whatever else technologies are necessary to make the human species capable of standing against their erstwhile potential alien superior adversaries. Send emissaries to the alien systems to learn more about their civilization, culture, science and technology, and generally act as ambassadors. If nothing else, this will enable humans to accurately gauge the risk potential of the aliens. if it turns out, the aliens genuinely perceive we are of no threat potential to them and they are truly unlikely to act against our species so much the better. There is one caveat to this set of combined strategies. If the aliens didn't see our species as a threat and we then developed the technology to match their capacity and capability this might change to our detriment. Once we can match them humans are now a threat that need to be stepped on. Wars usually break when neither side knows which of them is the superior militarily. When one adversary is clearly superior, the other naturally will avoid open conflict and warfare because they know they will lose. The greater proportion of the human population will be unconcerned. The existential threat is remote from their normal affairs and they will get on with their lives. In summary, do not antagonize a superior foe, potential or otherwise, but take sensible precautions to prepare for your long-term survival. 

The humanoid species would have to develop and evolve in an environment that maximized intelligence and skills and abilities necessary for technical work. Also, they would need to develop the psychosocial factors towards self-centredness. Once the humanoids created science and technology eventually as their technical culture increased they will develop advanced biomedical technology capable of enhancing and extending longevity. Given sufficient time the humanoids might find a way of developing technologically mediated immortality. In summary, the humanoids need to evolve to be capable of producing high level advanced technology. This will lead to increasing levels of life extension and longevity which eventually could turn into immortality. 

The first rule of biological warfare is develop the antidote or vaccine to whatever biological weapon you intend to deploy. That your enemies perish and people on your side can survive. Your basic biowarfare genius terrorist has to first develop his evil super-bug, then spend decades of research to create the antidote or vaccine. That's the real reason why super-virus weapons are unlikely, even if it's super easy to create new and deadly viruses it takes forever and a day to come up with an anti-super-virus vaccine. In the past when biological warfare was part of Cold War arsenals, establishments responsible for bioweapons claimed they weren't doing research into biological warfare. No, instead they were doing research into vaccines against deadly bacteria and viruses. Do you want to guess why? 

Source: ibid Higher concentration of Hc suggests the fluid blood itself needs to be saturated with Hc, rather like the blood of an octopus only more concentrated. However, Hc blood does work better at lower oxygen levels than hemoglobin blood. So if your reptilean alien existed in a low oxygen atmosphere, then Hc blood might be an advantage. But, fortunately, cynanoglobin seems to be out. Pity really the idea of blue blooded aliens is rather nice. Another beautiful hypothesis slain by an ugly fact (to paraphrase TH Huxley who called it the tragedy of science). 

Once on the planet in the hollow sphere system the scientists would set up a radio telescope to locate pulsars. Because pulsars are the ideal sign posts for navigating around the galaxy. This would be standard navigational procedure for interstellar expeditions. If the sphere blocks signals from outside, they won't be able to detect the pulsars. In fact, they will soon discover everything else in the radio universe was blocked too. A quick check with radar and lidar will fairly soon reveal this system is inside a hollow sphere. I have assumed basic technology like radar, radio telescopes and lidars will highly advanced kit and quite portable to boot. Their use will be standard procedure for galactic explorers making it straight forward to discover the nature of this closed system. Information about using pulsars for interstellar navigation can be found at: $URL$ 

Firstly if a plant had paleaolithic tools and it was making and using them you can be fairly sure it is sapient. Animals do have a capacity for tool use and relatively limited ability in tool making, but plants don't use tools full stop. Secondly the real problem is how sapience is understood. Currently there is a reevaluation of constitutes intelligence. This means it all to likely that by the time we get around to evaluate the sapient quotient of plants and hive organisms the parameters for determining sapience will have changed considerably. Many Earth-evolved species may be deemed sapient. This includes various birds like parrots and crows. Even dogs, dolphins and other cetaceans. One thing about sapience is the environment is a major determinant in shaping the evolution of intelligence. For example, parrots from the Vanuatu live in an environment with rich complexity and is relatively free from predators. This enables them to develop a remarkable degree of tool making and use. Take into the various environmental factors present to provide supporting evidence for your evaluation. Industrial relations and personnel management should have improved in the future and especially so for interstellar expeditioners. So if you make a mistake you won't need to worry about losing your job. You get counselled on doing a better job in sapience evaluation, but that isn't a great hardship, is it?
