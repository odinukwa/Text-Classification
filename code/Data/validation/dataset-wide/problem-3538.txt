In partial equilibrium, demand shifts down, with the (vertical) distance between the pre-tax and post-tax curve being exactly the height of the tax. pre-tax curve: $q=f(p)$ post-tax curve: $q=f(p+t)$ 

Given a hamiltonian of the form: \begin{equation} H_{t} = ln(c_{t}) \dot{} e ^{-\rho t} + \lambda_{t}(w+ra_{t}-c_{t}), \end{equation} with $c_{t}$ consumption at time t (the control variable), $\rho > 0$ time preference, $w$ a constant (for example wage), $a$ assets held in period t (this is the state variable for which the dynamics are described by: $\frac{da_{t}}{dt}=\dot{a_{t}}= w+ra_{t}-c_{t})$ and $r$ the return on assets. The first order conditions are: $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial c_{t}}=0$ $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}=-\dot{\lambda_{t}}$, or equivalently, $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}+\dot{\lambda_{t}}=0$. We were taught that $\frac{\partial H_{t}}{\partial a_{t}}$ can be interpreted as the marginal return on assets in t, and $\dot{\lambda}$ as a capital gain. Together they are the overal return. An accompanying sketch with $a_{t}$ on the horizontal and $H_{t}$ on the vertical axis shows $H_{t}$ is a concave function with a maximum. The growthpath for consumption is given by $\frac{\dot{c_{t}}}{c_{t}}=-\frac{\dot{\lambda_{t}}}{\lambda_{t}}-\rho$, so that consumption grows over time if $\rho+\frac{\dot{\lambda_{t}}}{\lambda_{t}}<0$, that is: consumption grows if the relative capital losses exceed time preference. As such, the optimizing agent should let his consumption grow when there are sufficiently big capital losses. My questions are the following: 

Are current flows of migration bigger that they were in the past? We tend to forget history because the numbers involved currently are smaller relative to world population. For instance, the 8.8 million immigrants who came to the United States in 1901-1910 period is of similar magnitude to the 9.1 million immigrants who came in the 1991-2000 period, but both the U.S. and world populations were much larger than in 1901-1910. Richard B. Freeman in a nice paper, entitled "People Flows in Globalization," reminds us about this fact. Some countries indeed receive large inflows of migrants The US, Russia and Germany are the biggest recipients of immigration (see Table 1 in the above paper). These flows have consequences for factor endowment and there is considerable and often heated controversy over their impacts on destination countries. How Do Immigrants Affect Their Countries of Arrival? Freeman examines this question (p.18 to 23) and reviews the empirics. In the basic model of immigration, immigrants reduce earnings of substitute factors and raise the earnings of complementary factors, where complements might include capital and some types of native-born labor. In the basic model, there is full employment but you may intuitively consider quantitative adjustments instead of price/wage adjustements by introducing frictions in the labor market. Note than in most advanced countries, immigrants have higher unemployment rates and lower employment rates than native workers. Related to this question a classical paper is "The Economics of Immigration," with theory and evidence by Georges Borjas in Journal of Economic Literature, December 1994. More recently, in 2015, Borjas published an interesting review on Immigration and Globalization. You mal also be intereted in reading his paper on how the collapse of the Soviet Union affects the productivity of American mathematicians. Regarding policies Freeman considers "radically economic policies" such as auctioning immigration visas or charging sizeable fees and spending the funds on current residents to increase the economic incentive for advanced countries to accept greater immigration. 

The quantity produced does not depend on the fixed costs. Fixed costs only influence the decision of whether or not to produce, not how much to produce. The individual firm's level of production is determined by MR=MC, independent of fixed costs. Firms will produce less when fixed cost decrease, because, as you point out, more firms will produce (entry in the market). On the aggregate market supply shifts out, so that price declines. For each individual pricetaking firm, the exogenously determined price has declined. Put differently, MR has shift down, resulting in an optimum (MR=MC) at a lower level of production. 

The Bartik instrument (from Bartik, 1991), also known as the shift-share instrument, is used as a typical instrument using 2-stage least squares regression. Here is an interesting example, using an explicit Bartik instrument. Hope this helps. Note that the required exogeneity condition of this instrument is not always satisfied. 

Considering your example, I guess that it could be a contribution to show that a small increase in benefit per capita may increase fertility. Is the benefit permanent? If not, I doubt that people will have a strong incentive to get another child. Moreover, it takes time to get a new child! So, there is a time dimension issue. They cannot claim the benefit if they don't have the child! If your design allow for this, you can exploit the time dimension in case some families respond to the incentive.

Different elements can contribute to such an evolution, without trying to be exhaustive, these are a few general comments: 

In the (very) short run, (VAR-)studies sometimes find a 'price puzzle': raising interest rates raises prices, instead of lowering them. This can be explained by the cost-channel of monetary transmission which is exactly what you described. It should be noted, however, that this puzzle does not always appear in all studies and that there may potentially be other explanations for the price puzzle. Caveat: falling prices when interest rates are raised, do not necesserily imply the absence of the cost channel, but can also indicate its subordination to other channels of monetary transmission. But there surely is a truth in your reasoning. 

Given a profit-maximizing firm with production function $f(x_1,x_2)$, I understand that we can formulate a firm's cost function $C(q)$ by using the contingent demand functions $x_1^c$ and $x_2^c$. We can then use this cost function to see whether a firm has decreasing costs, namely if $C(tq)<tC(q)$. If the second derivative of the cost function, C''(q), is less than zero, does that also imply that this firm faces decreasing costs and thus increasing returns to scale? 

You are right that it seems strange why a cash-rich company is borrowing. In the case of Apple, the money that they are borrowing is being used to pay dividends to shareholders. The reason why they aren't using their \$200 billion is because doing so would cost them tens of billions of dollars in taxes. The current US tax code taxes corporations at 35% when they bring money they made overseas back to the US (this is called repatriation). So while, Apple has \$200 billion on the surface, \$180 billion of that is sitting overseas and can't be used to pay shareholders. It is cheaper for them to borrow money to pay dividends, than incur the huge tax costs associated with repatriation. In general, however, borrowing is also attractive to firms today since interest rates are so low. If you can borrow at 4%, and expect to earn a return of 8% on that capital, taking on debt seems like a good deal. Therefore firms flush with cash still may borrow if they feel the return they can earn on the borrowed money is greater than the cost of interest. Check out this article from Bloomberg for more information on the Apple case: Bloomberg Article 

No, cointegration occurs when two series have the same stochastic trend. In order to have a stochastic trend, they should be nonstationary. Stationary variables do not have a trend. You can perform standard inference. 

Again, the existing literature does not always provide support for all these arguments. Next to the arguments in favor of secular stagnation (the first interpretation: growth below potential) that draw on shifts in the market for loanable funds, shifts in portfolios from risky to riskless assets and a shortage of safe assets may explain the observed decrease in real interest rates as well. All these arguments are discussed (most of them in depth) in the e-book. In addition to the Vox e-book, the blogs of Ben Bernanke and Larry Summers give valuable and opposing insights in the discussion. Furthermore, also in broader academia interest in the subject is booming. So, clearly, when searching for an answer to the question why advanced economies seem to be stuck in a period of low interest rates, you will not find a unique answer or a single theory but instead, you will find a vivid discussion with quite different views and arguments. As I mentioned, these links are a good starting point to indulge oneself in the discussion: 

Is there an economic theory of quitting an activity? A theory that weighs the investment costs put into something and the opportunity costs of pursuing it. I am aware of Fershtman and Gneezy Quitting in Tournaments paper that investigates the decision of quitting in the middle of a race or of a tournament. But, I am looking for a more general model of quitting something such as playing an instrument, a sport or even a job. Dropping-out from (grad)-school may obey the same investment-opportunity cost trade-off. Update: I am looking for some explicit references modeling the exiting or quitting process, even if it concerns some decisions in particular without any generalization. Edit: Here is why I picked @Ubiquitous' answer. 

Financialization describes the growth of financial services, instruments, and markets in the overall economy (compared industrial and agricultural parts). An important term that often accompanies financialization is financial innovation, which is often used to describe the creation of new financial instruments such as the mortgage-backed security (MBS), credit default swap (CDS), or collateralized debt obligation (CDO). Now these examples of "financial innovation" carry with them many negative connotations because their roles in the 2008 Financial Crisis. Investment banks created these products to provide investors will different risk exposures. The mortgage-backed security, for example, took grouped mortgages together and sliced them into different pieces (called "tranches"). Payments would first be distributed to the Senior tranche (which was often rated AAA) and then would be distributed to the lower Mezzanine tranches (which carried riskier credit ratings). Investors could then buy different tranches depending on how much risk they wanted to expose themselves to. Ideally, this would lead to a more efficient allocation of capital in markets as investors find investments tailored (the term bespoke is often used to describe these products) to their risk profiles. Unfortunately, however, the proliferation of these products led to a terrible buildup of leverage and risk since many people did not understand how these complicated (often called "exotic") instruments worked, culminating in the Financial Crisis. Financialization is a general trend that is occurring in our economy due to the rise of technology, lax financial regulation, and innovation in financial services. Many argue, however, that too much financialization reaches the point where people are trading securities completely detached from the real world (I would recommend checking out CDO-Squared. Justifying the "usefulness" of such an instrument is difficult) and devolves into reckless risk taking that just moves paper around in circles. Thus financialization while theoretically better allocating capital between borrowers and investors, also endangers the economy to the boom and must cycles of market exuberance and reversal. A famous quote from Paul Volcker captures this disdain for financial innovation following the financial crisis: "The only thing useful banks have invented in the past 20 years is the ATM." In my view, all forms of finance abstract the real world to an extent. For example, a share of a company is an abstract division of a real world entity. Different financial instruments carry with them different levels of abstraction, but we must always remember the underlying real world entity that they represent. If not, finance risks becoming detached once again from the real economy and loses sight of its purpose of allocating capital between borrowers and investors. For more the financial crisis, I highly recommend Michael Lewis's The Big Short. 

For advanced undergraduate students there is a nice, instructive and short book on The Microeconomics of Market Failures at MIT Press (2000) by Bernard Salanié from Columbia. The second revision of Introduction to Industrial Organization by Luis Cabral from NYU is a very good reference for undergraduates. The chapter 5 deals with Market Failure and Public Policy. Accompanying slides are available. 

A rather positive view of structural reforms In their recent Economic Policy Reforms 2016, Going for Growth Interim Report, the OECD reviews the main growth challenges faced by OECD and selected non-OECD countries and takes stock of the progress made since 2015 in the adoption and implementation of structural policy reforms to address these challenges. The chapter 2 in particular reviews the main issues related to the short-term impact of structural reforms in different macroeconomic contexts and takes stock of existing theoretical and empirical studies. It lays out the case of reforms introduced in "normal" and "bad" times. It identifies the main channels through which structural reforms influence rather favorably short-term activity through consumption, investment and net exports. The chapter discusses
