$\bullet$ The two most obvious special cases are (1) tilings of an octagon where $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = (k,k,k,k)$ and (2) tilings of a $2g$-gon with $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_g=1$. These are counted by Sloane A093937 and A006245 respectively. There is no closed formula in either case. $\bullet$ Such rhombus tilings are in bijection with reduced words in $S_{a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_g}$ modulo commutation. In particular, the case where $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_g=1$ corresponds to reduced words for the long word in $S_g$, modulo commutation. This has been rediscovered several times, but the canonical reference seems to be Rhombic tilings of polygons and classes of reduced words in Coxeter groups, by Serge Elnitsky. $\bullet$ Drawing the paths dual to the rhombi gives us an arrangement of pseudo-lines, sometimes called deBruijn paths. $\bullet$ Pseudo-line arrangements can be described by oriented matroids. Tracing through this language, the $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_g=1$ case corresponds to rank $3$ oriented matroids $M$ on the set $\{ 1,2,\ldots, g, \infty \}$ such that the underlying matroid is uniform and $M/\infty$ is the uniform rank $2$ oriented matroid where $\{1,2,\ldots,g \}$ appear in that cyclic order. Call that rank $2$ matroid $U(g)$. Dualizing, we are looking for extensions of the rank $g-2$ oriented matroid $U(g)^{\ast}$ whose underlying matroid is uniform. One can generalize this description to the general case: The matroid $U(g)$ becomes the oriented matroid of rank $2$ made up of $g$ parallelism classes, of sizes $a_1$, ..., $a_g$, in that cyclic order. Extensions of oriented matroids were studied by Sturmfels and Ziegler. In particular, they proved that a certain poset associated to this extension problem is homotopic to a sphere. $\bullet$ Let $A$ and $B$ be two subsets of $\{ 1,2,\ldots, g \}$. We say that $A$ and $B$ are strongly separated if either every element of $A \setminus B$ is less than every element of $B \setminus A$, or is every element of $B \setminus A$ is less than every element of $A \setminus B$. A collection $\mathcal{C}$ of subsets of $\{ 1,2,\ldots, g \}$ is called strongly separated if every two elements in the collection are strongly separated. A collection is called maximally strongly separated if it is strongly separated and is not contained in any larger strongly separated collection. Maximal strongly separated sets are in bijection with rhombus tilings of the $(1,1,\ldots,1)$-gon by a result of Leclerc and Zelevinsky. Although it doesn't appear to be in the literature, the generalization to other centrally symmetric polygons is easy enough: One uses the multiset with $a_i$ copies of $i$. Here if $A$ and $B$ are multisets which contain $u$ and $v$ copies of $i$, then $A \setminus B$ is the multiset which contains $\max(u-v, 0)$ copies of $i$. $\bullet$ Any two rhombus tilings of the same $2g$-gon are linked by a sequence of flips, where a flip takes a single hexagon and retiles it. This is the same as the fact that any two reduced words are (up to commutation) joined by a sequence of braid moves. $\bullet$ Take the flip graph referred to in the previous bullet point and direct it so that, in the language of braid moves, an edge points from $\cdots s_i s_{i+1} s_i \cdots$ to $\cdots s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+1} \cdots$. The resulting graph is acyclic, and is the Hasse diagram of the poset obtained by taking the transitive closure. This poset is graded and has unique minimum and maximum elements. When $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_g=1$, it is called the higher Bruhat order $B(g,2)$. It is a lattice for small $g$, but $B(6,2)$ is not a lattice. $\bullet$ Let $1 \leq i < j < k \leq n$ and let $\gamma_i$, $\gamma_j$ and $\gamma_k$ be pseudolines in directions $(i,j,k)$. Then they either intersect each other in the order $(i,j)$, $(i,k)$, $(j,k)$, or the reverse of this order. A triple of such pseudo-lines is called a triangle. The triangle is ordinary if the intersections occur in the first manner, and inverted if the occur in the second. For $\gamma$ and $\delta$ in $B(g,2)$, we have $\gamma \leq \delta$ if and only if every triangle which is inverted in $\gamma$ is also inverted in $\delta$. Presumably, this is also true when some of the sides of the polygon are longer than $1$, but I don't know a reference. For $\gamma$ and $\delta$ two pseudo-line arrangements, the flip distance from $\gamma$ to $\delta$ is bounded below by the number of triangles which are inverted in one of $\gamma$ and $\delta$ but not the other. This lower bound is exact for $g=3$ or $4$, for $g=5$ if one of the $a_i$ is $1$, and for $(2,2,2,2,2)$, but not for any other case. $\bullet$ The Bohne-Dress theorem: Let $C$ be the cube $\{ (x_1, \ldots, x_g) : 0 \leq x_i \leq a_i \} \subset \mathbb{R}^g$. Map $C$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$ by the linear map $\pi$ sending the $i$-th basis vector to $v_i$. So the $2g$-gon is the image of $\pi$. Then rhombus tilings of $\pi(C)$ are in bijection with continuous sections $\sigma: \pi(C) \to C$ whose image lies in the $2$-skeleton of the obvious cubical complex. $\bullet$ Miscellaneous: some interesting lemmas about rhombus tilings are proved in my paper with Andre Henriques and in Shapiro-Shapiro-Vainshtein. 

$\def\FF{\mathbb{F}_2}$ Indeed, the linear bound is close to right. I can show that we can't beat about $3.197 n$. For convenience, set $m=n/2$. Fix a constant $c$ and suppose that we can find $\geq cn$ vectors for infinitely many $n$. Notice that every $m$ element subset of our $cn$ vectors must have a different sum, or we could find a relation with at most $n$ terms. So $$\binom{cn}{m} \leq 2^{2n}$$ or $$(2cm)(2cm-1) \cdots (2cm-m+1) \leq 2^{2n} m! \leq 16^m m^m (e+o(1))^{-m} .$$ $$(2c)(2c-1/m)(2c-2/m) \cdots (2c-1+1/m) \leq (16 e^{-1} (1+o(1)))^m.$$ Taking logs $$\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} \log (2c-i/m) \leq \log 16 -1 + o(1).$$ or, sending $m \to \infty$. $$\int_{2c-1}^{2c} \log t dt \leq \log 16 - 1.$$ I get that this forces $c \leq 3.1965677$. 

Secret sharing. Suppose we have $N$ people. We want any $k+1$ of them to be able to launch a missile attack, but no $k$ of them to have this power. Solution: Choose some large prime $p$ and a random polynomial $f(t)$ of degree $k$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p$. Tell person $1$ the value of $f(1)$, person $2$ the value of $f(2)$ and so forth. (Also, everyone knows what $p$ is.) Set up the missiles to only launch when $f(0)$ is input. Any $k+1$ people can use the Chinese remainder theorem to compute $f$, and hence $f(0)$; any $k$ people do not have enough data to constrain $f(0)$ in any way. 

Notation: The Weyl algebra is $$k[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, \partial_1, \partial_2, \ldots, \partial_n]$$ with the obvious relations. The Weyl algebra doesn't contain any division rings larger than $k$, and it is infinite dimensional over $k$. So, assuming you don't allow infinite matrices, that's a proof. How to see that it doesn't contain any division ring larger than $k$? I just need to show that any nonconstant differential operator is not invertible. One way to see this is to notice that multiplying differential operators multiplies symbols, and the symbol of a nonconstant differential operator is a nonconstant polynomial. 

Note that this differs from the true EGA IV 13.1.5 by replacing "proper" with "surjective". I figured I'd record a counterexample here, which is slightly more public than just creating a handout for my class. Our map is a composition $X \subset \mathbb{A}^3 \to \mathbb{A}^3 \to Y \subset \mathbb{A}^4$. We'll call the two $\mathbb{A}^3$'s $A$ and $B$ respectively. $X$ is the quasi-affine variety $A \setminus \{ (0,\ast,0) \}$. We map $A \to B$ by $(x,y,z) \mapsto (x, xy, z)$. We map the $B$ to $\mathbb{A}^4$ by $(p,q,r) \mapsto (p(p-1), p^2(p-1), q,r)$. $Y$ is the affine variety $\{ (a,b,c,d) : a^3 = b(b-a) \}$. In other words, $Y$ is the product of a nodal cubic with $\mathbb{A}^2$. To see surjectivity, note that $X$ hits every point of $B$ where $p$ is nonzero. The points of $B$ where $p \neq 0$ map to the points of $Y$ where $(a,b) \neq (0,0)$. The points $(0,0,c,d)$ in $Y$ are the images of $(1,c,d) \in B$, which are in turn the images of $(1,c,d)$ in $X$. Now, let's look at $\dim f^{-1}(0,0,0,r)$. When $r \neq 0$, this is the union of $(1,0,r)$ and $(0, \ast, r)$, so one dimensional. When $r = 0$, the line $(0, \ast, 0)$ is deleted, so the preimage is only a point. This suggests that something nicer may happen if we insist that fibers are irreducible, or that $Y$ is normal (perhaps Zariski's Main Theorem gets involved?) but I don't have a proposed statement to make. 

I saw Brian Conrad give an excellent one hour talk to undergraduates where he proved that there do not exist nonconstant, relatively prime, polynomials $a(t)$, $b(t)$ and $c(t) \in \mathbb{C}[t]$ such that $$a(t)^3 + b(t)^3 = c(t)^3.$$ He gave an elementary proof, then outlined the better motivated proof where you see that $\mathbb{CP}^1$ can't map holomorphically to a genus $1$ curve. 

Assuming that the Hermitian minor has distinct eigenvalues, there is nothing we can say about the eigenvalues of $A$. Let the eigenvalues of the Hermitian minor be $\lambda_1$, ..., $\lambda_{n-1}$, so we can choose a matrix where your matrix looks like $$A=\begin{pmatrix} \lambda_1 & & & & a_1 \\ & \lambda_2 & & & a_2 \\ & & \lambda_3 & & a_3 \\ & & & \ddots & & \\ b_1 & b_2 & b_3 & & c \end{pmatrix}$$ The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $$f(x):=(x-c) \prod_{i} (x-\lambda_i) - \sum_j a_j b_j \prod_{i \neq j} (x-\lambda_i). \quad (\ast)$$ I claim that we can choose $c$ and $a_j b_j$ to make $f(x)$ be any monic degree $n$ polynomial. Proof: We have $f(\lambda_j) = - a_j b_j \prod_{i \neq j} (\lambda_i - \lambda_j)$. So, assuming that the $\lambda$'s are distinct, we can choose $a_j b_j$ to make $f(\lambda_j)$ have any value. Also, we can use $c$ to fix the value of $f$ at any $x$ other than the $\lambda_i$. A monic polynomial of degree $n$ is determined by its values at $n$ points, so we can arrange for $f$ to be any degree $n$ monic polynomial. $\square$ Equation $(\ast)$ also shows that, if $\lambda_i$ occurs with multiplicity $d$ in the Hermitian minor, then it occurs with multiplicity $\geq d-1$ in $A$.
