Here is an answer based on the many comments by myself and by Nick Gill. In characteristic 2 the transvections are always involutions, so generation by transvections implies generation by involutions in all dimensions. Below I will assume that the characteristic is not 2. In dimensions 2 the determinant is a symplectic form, thus $G$ is conjugated to $\text{SL}_2(F)$. Then it is easy to check that the only involutions in $G$ are $1$ and $-1$. In particular, $G$ is not generated by involtions. Below I will assume that the dimension is not 2. I claim that $G$ is generated by involutions. Note first that $G$ has at least one non-central involution: for example one can view the form as a direct sum of lower dimensional ones, take 1 on one and -1 on the other. Note also that the group generated by all non-central involution is normal and not central. This group must be $G$, as every proper normal subgroup of $G$ is central. Indeed, this is the case for every symplectic group apart of $\text{Sp}(2,\mathbb{F}_2)$, $\text{Sp}(2,\mathbb{F}_3)$ and $\text{Sp}(4,\mathbb{F}_2)$, and by the assumptions above $G$ is not in this list. 

Let me make a long comment here regarding the "q-analogue" of this question. Let me start with a product of $n$ linear orders of length 2, $\{0,1\}^n$ (in fact, it be better to think of this as length 1, as we start at 0). There is an obvious identification of this poset with the power set of $[n]$, $P([n])$. The simplicial complex associated with the latter is the $n-1$-simplex, and the chopped one is homeomorphic to the sphere $S^{n-1}$. Now for the "$q$-analogue": take a finite field of order $q$, $\mathbb{F}_q$ and consider $V=\mathbb{F}_q^n$. Consider the lattice of linear subspaces of $V$. The chopped lattice is known also as "the spherical Tits building of $\text{PGL}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$". Its homotopy type is considered in the Solomon-Tits Theorem which tells that it is a bouquet of $S^{n-1}$ spheres. Note that for $n=1$ the $q$-case degenerates to the first: you get the same lattice. Keep $n=1$, take $q=p$ a prime for simplicity, pick a "length" $k$ and consider the ring $R=\mathbb{Z}/p^k$. Consider the lattice of ideals in $R$. It is a chain of length $k+1$. That is, it coincides with the $n=1$"combinatorial" question considered in the original post, which we may think of as the "$q=1$ case". Repeat this with arbitrary $n$: Let $M=\oplus_{i=1}^n \mathbb{Z}/p^{k_i}$ and consider the lattices of subgroups (or $\mathbb{Z}_p$-submodules). One may think of this lattice as the "$p$-analuge" of the one considered in the original post. It turns out (and this is shown in comments and in other answers) that this lattice will be contractible provided for some $i$, $k_i>1$. 

I have a few further ideas for applications gaming finite geometries and I take this opportunity to invite whoever codes and have interest in such a project to contact me (the TicatacToe was programmed by my brother, Gal Bader, but he is too busy now). 

There exists a $\Gamma$-invariant measure on $\overline{\partial^{\text{min}}_M\Gamma}$, $\nu'$. $\nu$ is not invariant. 

Let me turn my comment into an answer. I claim that for fixed $\mu\in\text{Prob}(\mathbb{C})$ and $f\in C_c(\mathbb{C})$, $$ \int f(z)d\mu(z)= \lim_{r\to 0} \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \int\mu_w([0,r))f(w) d\lambda(w), $$ where $\lambda$ is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{C}$. To see this, fix $\epsilon>0$, let $\delta$ be the one given by the uniform continuity of $f$, and observe that for $r\leq \delta$, $$ \left|\int f(z)d\mu(z)- \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \int\mu_w([0,r))f(w) d\lambda(w)\right|=$$ $$ \left|\int d\mu(z)\int_{|w-z|\leq r} d\lambda(w)\frac{f(z)}{\pi r^2} - \int d\lambda(w)\int_{|z-w|\leq r} d\mu(z)\frac{f(w)}{\pi r^2} \right| =$$ $$\left| \int d\mu(z)\int_{|w-z|\leq r}d\lambda(w) \frac{f(z)-f(w)}{\pi r^2}\right|\leq$$ $$ \int d\mu(z)\int_{|w-z|\leq r}d\lambda(w) \frac{|f(z)-f(w)|}{\pi r^2} \leq\epsilon.$$ 

The inequalities you seek are correct for any Riemannian manifold with bounds on the curvature (upper/lower bounds for corresponding sides of the inequalities), once you take the Riemannian volume and Riemannian metric. In particular, this is the case for a compact Riemannian manifolds. Our Grassmanian could be seen as a Riemannian manifold, by embedding it in $\text{End}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ as you do, and restrict the standard inner product to the tangent spaces. The obtained Riemannian structure will be $G$-invariant (for $G=\text{O}(n)$ of course). For our manifold, up to normalization, the Riemannian volume coincides with the Haar measure, as both are $G$-invariant, by "uniqueness". For a Riemannain manifold $M$ and a compact submanifold $N$ the two metrics on $N$, the restriction to $N$ of the Riemannian metric of $M$ and the Riemannian metric of $N$ associated with the induced Riemannian structure, are biLipischits (this is an easy excercise). All norms on a Euclidean space are equivalent. 

Let me work through an example for you. Take a $(2,8)$ form on $V=\mathbb{R}^{10}$. Let $G=\text{O}(2,8)$ be the group fixing this form. You can find in $V$ isotropic lines, isotropic planes (but not higher dimensional isotropic spaces) and isotropic flags (a pair, isotropic line inside an isotropic plane). The parabolics in $G$ will be the stabilizers of such objects (and the stabilizer of 0, which is $G$ itself). In particular, you will have four types of parabolics. The stabilizer of a flag is minimal: every other parabolic contains such. You can write one explicitly and observe that it contains a normal solvable subgroup, and modulo it you get a compact group $(\simeq \text{O}(6)$, the isometry group of the perp of the isotroic plane mod its radical). If I was to consider a $(5,5)$ form I would get $2^5$ types of parabolics, each being the stabilizer of some isotropic flag. This is the "split case". The parabolic pattern here is the same as in its complexification. Note that upon complexifying the two cases above are conjugated: a conjugating matrix could be taken to be a diagonal matrix with 7 1's ant 3 $i$'s (this is wrt some natural choice of coordinates). You now see that some, but not all, of the parabolic types in the complexification are actually represented in $G$. These are "defined over the reals". This generalizes. In the complexification you always have $2^R$ types of parabolics, $R$ is called the (split or complex) rank of $G$, each contains a minimal one and the minimal ones, called "Borel subgroups", are all solvable. In fact, a subgroup of the complex group is parabolic iff it contains a Borel subgroup. Among all parabolic types in the complexified group, only $2^r$ types are represented in $G$, $r$ is called the real rank of $G$. These are said to be defined over the reals. Each such parabolic contains a minimal such one, the minimal ones are always solvable by compact. In fact, a subgroup of $G$ is parabolic iff it contains a minimal parabolic. An extreme case is when $G$ is compact. Then the only prabolic which is defined over the reals is $G$ itself. In this case the real rank of $G$ is 0. The other extreme, where $r=R$, is called "the split case". 

*$ $ You should appreciate this theorem even if you have no interest in ergodicity per-se. It has many outside applications, e.g for counting and equidistribution results. Let me mention in particular that it is an essential ingridant in the celebrated Wise-Agol result (previously known as the virtually fibered conjecture). It enters its proof via the work of Kahn--Markovic. 

Bonus exercise: based on the proof of the lemma above, prove that for general $l$ and $m$, the maximal number of pairwise trivially intersecting $l$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_q^m$ is $\frac{q^{\lfloor \frac{m}{l}\rfloor\cdot l}-1}{q^l-1}$. 

Sorry for adding a second proof, but I think I have now a much clearer one. Let $k$ be a local field. Let $\mathbf{T}$ be a $k$-anisotropic torus, that is $\mathbf{T}$ contains no $k$-subgroup $k$-isomorphic to $\mathbf{G}_m$. It is standard that $T$ also doesn't have a non-trivial $k$-homorphism to $\mathbf{G}_m$. We argue to show that $T=\mathbf{T}(k)$ is compact. We assume as we may that $T$ is Zariski dense in $\mathbf{T}$. We fix a non-trivial irreducible $k$-representation $\mathbf{T}\to\text{GL}_n$. As mentioned above, $n>1$. We use the fact that the $T$-orbits on $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}(k)$ are locally closed to find a point $x\in \mathbb{P}^{n-1}(k)$ with a $T$-closed orbit. We let $S$ be the stabilizer of $x$ in $T$ and $\mathbf{S}$ be the Zariski closure of $S$ in $\mathbf{T}$. $\mathbf{S}$ is a proper $k$-subtorus. By an induction argument we may assume that $S=\mathbf{S}(k)$ is compact. We deduce that $T$ is compact. 

Yes, conditions 1 and 2 are equivalent (as you already noticed). Let me start by replacing both definitions with their negations, and replace definition 2 with its $L^1$-version. A and B below are the negations of 1 and 2 correspondingly, slightly rewritten: A. There exists a sequence of measurable subsets $\emptyset,X\neq A_n\subset X$ such that for every $s\in S$, $$(*)\quad \frac{\|(\chi_{A_n}-\mu(A_n)\cdot 1)-s(\chi_{A_n}-\mu(A_n)\cdot 1)\|_1}{\|(\chi_{A_n}-\mu(A_n)\cdot 1)\|_1} = \frac{\mu(A_n \Delta sA_n)}{\mu(A_n)(1-\mu(A_n))}\to 0.$$ B. There exists a sequence of vectors $0\neq v_n$ in $L^1_0(X)$ such that for every $s\in S$, $$(**) \quad \frac{\|v_n-sv_n\|_1}{\|v_n\|_1} \to 0.$$ To see that A is the negation of 1 is straightforward. To see that B is the negation of 2, recall that the map $L^2\ni u\mapsto \text{sgn}(u)\cdot |u|^2\in L^1$ is uniformly continuous equivariant map on the unit sphere. Use it and a projection mod constants. I am not elaborating, as this is well known. From now on we work in $L^1$ exclusively, thus $\|\cdot\|=\|\cdot\|_1$. Clearly A $\Rightarrow$ B. The rest of this post is devoted to proving the application B $\Rightarrow$ A. Thus, we assume that $v_n$ is a sequence of unit vectors satisfying $(**)$ and argue to provide a sequence $A_n$ satisfying $(*)$. Let me denote by $B$ the unit ball in $L^1_0(X)$. The idea, as usual, is to map $B$ continuously into a compact space and take a limit point of the image of the sequence $v_n$. A first candidate for such a map that comes to mind is the embedding into the unit ball of $L^1(X)^{**}\simeq L^\infty(X)^*$. This idea will lead us eventually to prove the existence of an invariant mean, as in the answer by Mateusz Wasilewski, but justifying everything down this road seems longer than the path we take below in which we use another map. Consider the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}$, $P$. Endow $P$ with the weakest topology for which integration against every function in $C_c(\mathbb{R})$ is continuous. Observe that the map $B\to P$, $f\mapsto f_*\mu$ is continuous and that the image is precompact (use Prokhorov's theorem). Let me denote $\nu_n=(v_n)_*\mu\in P$ and assume as we may that $\nu_n\to \nu$. We consider two different cases: either $\nu$ is a point mass or not. In case $\nu$ is NOT a point mass we can find and fix $t\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $\nu(-\infty,t),\nu(t,\infty)>0$ and then, defining $A_n=v_n^{-1}(t,\infty)$, it easy to check that $(*)$ is satisfied (use the continuity of $B\to P$). From now on we assume $\nu$ is a point mass, that is $\nu=\delta_t$ for some $t\in \mathbb{R}$. By the fact that $\int v_n=0$ and $\int|v_n|=1$ it is easy to conclude that $|t|\leq 1/2$ and it follows that $1/2\leq \|v_n-t\|<3/2$. It is also easy to see that the sequence $|v_n-t|$ is almost invariant in $L^1(X)$ and that $|v_n-t|_*\mu \to \delta_0$. We normalize this sequence, setting $u_n=|v_n-t|/\|v_n-t\|$. To summarize: we found a new almost invariant sequence of positive unit vectors $u_n\in L^1(X)$ such that $(u_n)_*\mu\to \delta_0$. We assume as we may that $\sum_{s\in S}\|su_n-u_n\|< \|u_n\|/n$. The construction of the sequence $A_n$ will follow by the "layer cake decomposition" method: for every positive function $f\in L^1(X)$, $\int_X f=\int_0^\infty f_*\mu(t,\infty)dt$. Applying this decomposition to the functions $|su_n-u_n|$ and $u_n$ we obtain $$ \sum_{s\in S}\int_0^\infty |su_n-u_n|_*\mu(t,\infty)dt=\sum_{s\in S}\int_X |su_n-u_n|=\sum_{s\in S}\|su_n-u_n\| $$ $$ < \|u_n\|/n = 1/n \int_X u_n =1/n \int_0^\infty (u_n)_*\mu(t,\infty)dt $$ and deduce the existence of $t>0$ for which $$ \sum_{s\in S} |su_n-u_n|_*\mu(t,\infty) < 1/n (u_n)_*\mu(t,\infty). $$ We set $A_n=u_n^{-1}(t,\infty)$ and conclude $\sum_{s\in S} \mu(A_n \Delta sA_n) < 1/n \mu(A_n)$. By the strict inequality we get $A_n\neq \emptyset$. Since $(u_n)_*\mu\to \delta_0$ we have $1-\mu(A_n)\to 1$, thus we may assume $A_n\neq X$, and indeed we get $$ \frac{\mu(A_n \Delta sA_n)}{\mu(A_n)(1-\mu(A_n))} \to 0. $$ 

More generally (I think), taking any simple Lie group $G$ and $X=G/U$ for a unipotent subgroup $U$, you will get a distal action with no isometric factors. This follows from the fact that $U$ has closed orbits on $G/U$ and Theorem 6.2 in $URL$ 

I assume $2i\leq n$ (otherwise use duality and replace $\text{Gr}_{i,n}$ with $\text{Gr}_{n-i,n}$). I claim that the set of orbits is parametrized by $i$-tuples $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_i)$, where $\lambda_j\in \{0,1,2,\ldots,\infty\}$ and $\lambda_j\leq \lambda_{j+1}$ (for $2i\geq n$ it will be $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_{n-i})$). For a commutative ring $R$ I use here the term $\text{Gr}_{i,n}(R)$ to denote the space of direct summands of $R^n$ which are isomorphic to $R^i$. Note that there is a natural (and $\text{GL}_n(\mathcal{O})$-equivariant) identification of $\text{Gr}_{i,n}(F)$ with $\text{Gr}_{i,n}(\mathcal{O})$, thus we may forget about $F$ and focus on $\text{Gr}_{i,n}(\mathcal{O})$. Let $p<\mathcal{O}$ be the maximal ideal. Note that two pairs of modules in $\text{Gr}_{i,n}(\mathcal{O})$ are in the same $\text{GL}_n(\mathcal{O})$-orbit iff their reductions mod $p^k$ are in the same $\text{GL}_n(\mathcal{O}/p^k)$-orbit for every natural $k$. Fix $k$ and consider $\mathcal{O}/p^k$-modules. You can check that two pairs $(x,y),(x',y') \in \text{Gr}_{i,n}(\mathcal{O}/p^k) \times \text{Gr}_{i,n}(\mathcal{O}/p^k)$ are in the same $\text{GL}_n(\mathcal{O}/p^k)$-orbit iff $x\cap y \simeq x' \cap y'$. Up to an isomorphism, the intersection module $x\cap y$ could be an arbitrary $\mathcal{O}/p^k$-module of rank bounded by $i$ (here we use $2i\leq n$). The isomorphism types of such modules are parametrized by $i$-tuples $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_i)$, where $\lambda_j\in \{0,1,2,\ldots, k\}$ and $\lambda_j\leq \lambda_{j+1}$, where a module of type $\lambda$ is isomorphic to $\oplus_j \mathcal{O}/p^{\lambda_j}$. A discussion and justifications are given in claim 2.2 here. Now, for $(x,y)\in \text{Gr}_{i,n}(\mathcal{O})\times \text{Gr}_{i,n}(\mathcal{O})$, consider the limit of the tuples $\lambda$ associated with their reduction mod $p^k$ where $k$ tends to $\infty$. 

Use a selection theorem to choose measurably a unit vector in $V_x$. Consider now a new measurable collection of vector spaces $V'_x$ given as the orthogonal complements of the chosen vectors. Iterate $d$-times. By now you got a measurable choice of orthogonal basis. Fix an orthonormal basis in $W$. Use these bases to define $T_x$. 

Let me start by addressing the question hinted on in the title, which in my view is more interesting than the question eventually asked in the body. 

The answer is "No". You don't specify which kind of representation you have in mind. I assume these are finite dimensional complex representations. Thus you ask about (continuous) homomorphisms $G\to \text{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$. In the groups $G$ you consider you have a non trivial normal nilpotent subgroup $N$, the group of translations (aka the unipotent radical). Let $Z$ be the center of $N$. It is still normal in $G$. In your case $Z=N$. Decompose $V=\mathbb{C}^n$ to a direct sum of $Z$-eigenspaces. Each of these is $G$-invariant. Thus, if $V$ is $G$-irreducible then each element of $Z$ must act by a scalar multiplication on $V$. In particular, in the image of $G$, $Z$ must be central. In your specific groups the only normal subgroups are $\{e\},G$ and $N$ ($=Z$ ), and $N$ is not central in $G$. So $N$ must be in the kernel of the representation. 

Yes. Consider $H_1H_2$ as a subset of $H$. This is a $H_1\times H_2$ homogeneous space (for left-times-right action). On such a space there is a unique (up to scale) $H_1\times H_2$-invariant measure. But in our case we see obvious two ones: the restriction of $\mu_H$ and the push foreward of $\mu_{H_1}\times \mu_{H_2}$. Thus these two conicide, and the answer follows. 

No. Take $V=\mathbb{R}^2$, $d=1$ and define $\pi$ by $\pi(v)=\text{span}(v)$ if $\|v\|=1$, $\pi(v)=\{0\}$ otherwise. Then $\pi$ is usc and a continuous $\eta$ doesn't exist, as the image of $S^1$ is a nontrivial cocycle in $\text{Gr}(V,1)$. Note also that $\pi(v)=\text{span}(v)$ for all $v$ is an example of a lsc $\pi$ with no $\eta$. However, if $\pi:V\to\text{Gr}(V,k)$ is actually continuous for some $k<d$, then such $\eta$ does exist. To see this it is enough to assume $d=k+1$. Then use the contractibility of $V$ to find a no trivial section to the vector bundle $E$ over $V$ given by $E_v=\pi(v)^\perp$ and add it to $\pi$.
