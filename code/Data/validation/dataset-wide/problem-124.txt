Long term survival of the species by means of cannibalism is simply not possible. Without any other mechanism to put energy in the system it is simply not sustainable. The stronger will eat the weaker and then the last remaining will starve to death. Although a vast population spread over a large area could take quite a while before complete extinction. Consider that even on Earth, with its countless species of life, there is no such thing as a self-sustainable ecosystem. For the vast majority of ecosystems on the planet, save for deep sea creatures, 90% of the energy actually comes from the outside - namely that is solar radiation, a.k.a sunlight. A simplified foodchain energy pyramid puts every step of the pyramid at an order of magnitude less energy content. Meaning that plant matter constitutes only 10% of all incoming solar radiation energy, primary consumers only 10% of plant matter, and so on. 

Just to expound on my example a bit, if orcs couldn't obtain nutrition from plants that are easily farmed, it would limit there ability to form permanent communities. After all, some of the first permanent structures humans build were storehouse for grain and seeds. Orcs, on the other hand, might only settle down in areas with a high concentration of animals or spend all there time herding animals across grasslands so they can eat them. If a large amount of orcs try to occupy an unsuitable area, they would overhunt their surroundings and starve. This would also make orc-based armies a difficult organization to plan for. Instead of carts of hardtack and gruel, they have to bring live animals with them to periodically slaughter and cook. Pillaging would also be less effective, as they could only eat what little animals the average peasant owned. If their lucky, an average household might get some chickens, a dog, and maybe a cow, and that's being extremely generous. Course, they might be able to justify eating the peasants too. Not cannibalism if their not your species, technically. That would make bands of orcs a heap-and-a-handful more menacing to see outside the city gates. That being said, I think orcs would be a lot better off if they settling among humans. As laborers, they can outperform humans in terms of lifting power and endurance. Or, if you got the resources, a standing army of orcs would be a heck of a deterrent and military asset to a nation. Just make sure you have a lot of animals for them to eat or orcs will be forced to leave you high and dry. Even without the meat-paying jobs, orcs could probably benefit from human farming techniques. As they have more stability and more time on their hands, humans might develop tools and systems that orcs would love to copy as well. Orcs might master horseriding and animal husbandry, but humans could invent the stirrup and calculus. Not that this would matter in the long terms, sense both species would learn from each other, averaging out the differences. This system might be able to have orcs that are twice as physically capable as humans, but humans have a lot more friends that live within shouting distance. It also has orcs as terrifying marauders, but also supports orc ranchers, construction workers, and samurai (originally I was just going to say watchmen, but this seems both more accurate and cooler). The species have respect for each other, but also a turbulent history. After all, its hard to live with "your granddad ate my granddad" and its hard to convince your orc toddler not to throw their human playmate over the fence and take their toys. That being said, reading everyone else's answers has been inspiring and helped flesh out my current solution. I would highly recommend shopping around to see what appeals most to you, dear reader. 

Another possibility is that younger individuals, being smaller and more nimble and agile, might be able to catch food that older, larger and slower individuals might not. But that's not very sustainable IMO. It could also be the reverse, as individuals age, they might acquire traits and skills to obtain food from alternative sources. For example growing external physical features with the properties of a net that can trap large enough quantities of insects or microorganisms (like a whale does with plankton) to be a viable source of food for a long term survival. The older an individual grows, the more calories it can obtain, allowing it to grow in size significantly, to the point of becoming a high value target for a pack of younger individuals that will be required to take it down. With age individuals might also develop glands that produce chemicals that attract more of their foodstuff. That sounds fairly sustainable, the young will initially be breast-fed up to a point, after which they will be forced to prey on one another, as they wouldn't really pack enough force to take down an adult, in a process of natural selection that will allow only the strongest to reach physical size large enough, so that they can take down adults by forming packs. And only the most successful members of each pack would be able to reach adulthood when they can attain self-reliance by developing capabilities to access another food source, and over time become prey to the subsequent generations. 

With some tinkering, this might be workable. Solar sails might be a bit impractical for a raiding ship, unless they were just using them to reach the relevant solar system. Once they get a couple light-minutes away, they stow the sails and switch to thrusters. Or, if your okay with keeping the viking motif but getting rid of the solar sails, turn them into solar panels. Its pretty low tech for space-vikings, but this seems like a scavengers-verses-Robinson_Crusoe situation, so this might be plausible. Something you may have fun with some of worldbuilding's discussions on space boarding parties. Among the possible weapons suggested for boarding a ship/space station (without venting out all the air via gunshot holes or wreking the goods the raiders wanted in the first place) are shields and melee weapons. Now you have a justification why your raiders are armed like 10th century Norsemen! I might suggest against making the space-longboats open top, but I'm sure you could justify that as really good and comfy space-suits and the need to get out of their ship on onto the hull of the others as fast as possible. Still, an almond-shaped craft with solar sails (or solar panels) would probably look enough like a longboat for readers/viewers to get the allusion. A possible problem could be that its incredibly easy to shoot down invading spacecraft in . . . uh . . . space. Just a bloke with a quality telescope and a 50 caliber sniper rifle might be able to fend off your viking raiders. An easy fix would be putting a big object (like a thick metal sheet or a rock) in front of the ships to act like a shield. A laser array would be preferable, but that a hard thing to make without some fancy computers, factories, and know-how. Lastly, asteroids around a gas giant would technically be called moons. Asteroid belts circle around the sun between the gas giants and the rocky planets near the core. The moons around a gas giant do contain sweet stuff like water, but asteroid belts have valuable metals that are a lot easier to get to. Either one would make for a good setting for this story, I just thought you might benefit from some terminology. Welcome to Worldbuilding, by the way. I sincerely hope you have a enjoyable time looking about for answers and questions. 

If a plausible scenario is desired, then there must be another food source, one that is of very low efficiency, requiring a lot of effort to obtain food with very low nutritional value. This also offers additional plot directions, as the population will gradually diverge into a cannibal group that seeks the high stakes, risking their lives to obtain high protein meat, and a group that is more like herbivores, although they can go for insects or microorganisms or some symbiotic relation with other species of life that can still provide nourishment. Depending on the environment setting, both groups could develop either collective or individualistic behavior and grow more and more distinct. The divergence can be either a conscious choice or a product of evolution. A subset of the species might not be able to extract nutritional value from a source other than meat. 

One of my favorite bits of set dressing is magic glowing rocks. You see them in movies, video games, and every other manner of medium conveying fantasy settings. Personally, I'm perfectly okay with light sources with no needed fuel and operate indefinably, but I had an idea that I thought might be interesting. What if these rocks constantly produced ultraviolet light in addition what they emit on the visible spectrum? My first thought was underground farming, but I realized that a developing society wouldn't really benefit from being able to do that. Now I'm wondering if this glowy rock is just slightly more practical luxury item that gives you a tan. What ramifications of this magic tanning-bed stone might I missing? Relevant details about this rock include being about as rare and easy to find as gold (unless deceased scarcity leads to something cool, of course), always glowing as bright as a candle regardless of quantity (more surface area means more light, however), and producing an amount of UV light equal to the sun as filtered through the Earth's atmosphere. Skin cancer would be possible consequence, but Romans never found out the horrible truth of lead pipes, so I doubt anyone would notice the detrimental effects of the glowy rocks. Unless I'm mistaken, of course. 

Now, eliminate every other food source save for cannibalism. It will probably be worse than 10x decrease, for the sake of simplicity assume that a predator reaches maturity in 2 years, and all predators are cannibalized at that age, it would take on average consuming 1 member of the species monthly for 2 years, or 24 in total for the system to produce another "ready to eat" adult animal. Now, if you have a 24 fold decrease for every iteration, it is quite obvious that sustainability is entirely out of question, and you have an example population size, it is trivial to calculate how many generations it will take until extinction. Let's assume a rather numerous population of 1 million: 

I'm uncomfortable putting "nano-tech" and "melee weapon" in the same sentence for the same reason I don't think nuclear fusion handguns would catch on. Its over-designing to the point of being dangerous. That being said, saying your device works by applied magnetism could be interesting. Maybe the protagonist has a device that can fuse metal shavings into programmable shapes? That could explain the malleability without the chance of a grey goo indecent. Only downside would be turning the new shapes back into metal shavings. It would probably be easier just to throw the old shape away and make a new one from scratch. Basically I'm talking about a tools that arranges the parts (metal shavings) and fusing them together with magnetism. Or, if you want to avoid pseudo-science of super accurate and portable electromagnets, have the character carry a suitcase-sized 3d printer. The printer could scan objects, then replicate them. All it could need is to be reloaded with materials whenever it ran out. While this goes beyond the scope of the question, justifying this device in-universe could be interesting. No offence to martial artists or swordsmen, but long ranged armaments seems like the way of the future, so a hyper-advanced melee weapon is an odd tool to see. I can totally imagine a character custom ordering one for a specific task, but his mechanic/engineer would still look at him/her funny. However, the ability to get custom-made tools on the fly would be fantastic if you are a mechanic. With a machine like Budhaditya described or the gizmos I talked about, you could make wrenches of any size, parts to replace any broken ones, and any kind of tool you could imagine. Then, when the character is in trouble, they could find one of these in-universe multi-tools and program it to make simple weapons. Oh, and countering this weapon would probably best be done by shooting the character holding it with a gun or gun-adjacent object.
