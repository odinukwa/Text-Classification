@Alexander von Wernherr comment to the original question is apt. Not only are prey animals adapted to avoiding a fight instinctually (generally speaking), but physically as well. A hare that was about 5' 10" and 185 lbs would have two big front teeth, and some claws, but most of that 185 lbs would be in its massive hind legs. A rabbit does not kick as part of its fighting. And here's one reason why: A rabbit's skeletal structure is overall much lighter compared to predators (because it is built for speed), and shatter relatively easily. Femurs sometimes break just from jumping. Fighting is not winning for a rabbit. Its eyes are set more to the side of its head with almost 360 degrees of view, but no binocular vision -- which is real handy when you are trying to bite (or punch) something, especially a moving thing. You can't just scale up things and get equal return for size. If you take the long, light and thin leg bones of a rabbit, and you make them even longer, and attach about 100 lbs more muscle weight to it, those bones may no longer be able to take the stress. The bending stresses may be tolerable when the bone is only two inches long, but if they are going to be two feet long, then the proportions and the density have to be beefed up. A good example is engines used before the Wright Brothers; they were simply not able to output enough power to carry their own weight. Bigger engines put out more power but they weighed more too. It also ate a lot more fuel and generated a lot more heat. A tiny engine is less likely to melt itself. That same engine fifty times bigger actually might. Making things bigger increases the advantages but also increases the disadvantages. A timber wolf, on the other hand, has every advantage. It is a sleek killing machine, not a fast grazing machine. However, even a 5' 10" rabbit could still kill you or a wolf if it got a lucky bite in. So size alone would make it more dangerous for the wolf, but all in all the wolf is built to kill, and a rabbit is built to run. 

So you need a constant standing military in a region with a food deficit. This means people are going hungry. Who is going hungry? That depends on the social situation. Its not the military or the elites since they have control over the food. Now which of the remaining factions are left hungry kind of depends on everyones place in your society. The coin thing has been answered quite well so I won't go into it. You'll have to decide what happens to beggars. By beggars I mean anyone who cant hold down a job for whatever reason, they're crippled, or have special needs, whatever. They may be killed, they may find use as explorers since its super dangerous. Dunno. But there isn't any food and no resources for charity. The lack of outside trade doesn't really affect them unless there is some good or service that can't be reproduced. Considering they have survivors from all the lands there shouldn't be a skills shortage. Unless there is therefore a resource shortage the only issue with the lack of trade is the food shortage. Internal market then should have all the stuff that is available in the region. It probably wont have high quality finished goods because many of the artisans have recently arrived and have had to rebuild a workshop from scraps. Unless it was being built here before the apocalypse its going to be low-quality. Other than that I don't see it being different from any other market, food, goods and services are exchanged for each other on the basis of supply and demand of each. 

First thing I would consider is gravity on the worm, you have, essentially, a giant sack of water. You need to consider how it holds itself up, things like whales tend to die out of water because they are unsupported. Potentially it could use the walls of its tunnels to support itself, that could be an interesting limitation on the worm, if it exposes too much of itself it can die. Next you have heat, living things need to dissipate heat, depending on how fast your worm is going the heat needs to: a) get removed from the worm (conductive slime to transfer heat to walls? excrement?) b) get moved far away from the worm so it can continue to produce and eject heat Maybe your worm makes holes in the surface to shoot out piles of high-temperature fecal matter, maybe it needs certain chemicals to run endothermic reactions internally, maybe its just very very heat resistant (and has a high conductivity meaning the heat transfer through the worm is fast). Food, urgh, this thing is going to be using a huge amount of energy to move. I think biological machines are about 30% efficient, so all that heat it made, it needs all that and more (i.e. only 30% of the energy it eats is food, the rest is heat). This is probably going to need some suspension of disbelief. It needs to either consume dirt that gives it more energy than it takes to move through the dirt, or eat something else. Maybe you could get away with it eating coal or something, a high energy-density material like that. Otherwise its going to be biomass of some kind. Probably not flesh because theres probably no way to get enough flesh efficiently enough to sustain it (unless its a stationary trap worm). Meat tends to run away from things that try to eat it. Also it would need a very large prey population. This would have to maybe eat trees? Maybe it eats a tree and then just sits there and digests it. So you dont have the heat and the efficiency problem, since its only the minimum energy it needs. Then it goes on to the next tree, since this is a forest. I guess then it kind of rejuvenates the forest behind it. Maybe it serves as the forest fire of its planet? Hope this helps. 

What's Good is Good The question asks a lot, so first let me clarify my understanding of the question. The wizard wants to make a better society. But evolution works on individuals. Typically, "successful" individuals spread their traits by reproducing more than their competitors. But the question is about creating individuals who are most "comfortable" in a society, such that the society is "better." "Better" is not defined. Thomas More, Thoreau, Big Brother, and the Unabomber all have different ideas of "better." So, lots going on here. Killer Bunnies I know this is not what you are looking for, but at some point, the constituent make up of this society needs to change from what it is now, to include a significant number of these mutant individuals (let's call them "happy folk.") Either a controlling minority, or a plurality, a majority, or the entirety. In order to do this, the happy folk need to be better at reproducing themselves--whether it be Duggar-style family planning or good ol' fashioned human cloning--or, they need to be better at surviving some situation that reduces the current, non-happy population. Or both: happy folk can multiply like bunnies and also have a "negative" effect on the current population, like say, murdering them. This is not unheard of. I do not mean to offend, but some (not necessarily me) would say that the population of Israel is undergoing exactly such a change. An indigenous population is rapidly being replaced by another. What Was Good is Not Good So you see my problem with this question? By changing individuals to be happy in a society, you wind up changing the society. But I can imagine that somehow you reach an equilibrium where [almost] everyone is happy enough to no longer require further tweaking to fit into society. Although these "static societies" are often portrayed as being fundamentally flawed, that's usually because the protagonist is an outsider. For example, Logan's Run/Brave New World: people are pretty convinced that they're happy (at least so long as you are in society's good graces). Everyone is generally predisposed to accept or like their position in society, coupled with some reinforcing education and fostering. Everyone has fulfilling work and takes recreational drugs and is promiscuous. People have just enough problems to have just enough morals to basically not realize the bubble they're in. Is that what you want? Is that what anybody wants? Running In Place The factors listed in the original question are great. When navigating New York's "smellscape," one can easily see how nice it would be to control your own senses. (I think that's why people wear earbuds and dark sunglasses on the subway.) But every tweak raises potential society-ruining side-effects which might only lead to an "evolutionary war." (The classic example of evolutionary war is: prey develops poison, predator develops immunity. Prey develops stronger poison. That's how you get tiny frogs that can kill an elephant.) For example, let's say that the wizard wanted to make society more cohesive and compassionate and so he made individuals feel a closer sense of "brotherly love." Let's say happy folk identify other happy folk in the same way that animals recognize kin. Well, the obvious side effect can be that they become xenophobic. Or, the logical extreme can be that they become fascist (the thinking is that all happy folk express their true "happiness" by adopting normative behaviors, and that anyone who doesn't act happy is a traitor and a threat to society). Better How? So, to return to the spirit of your question: if you want to keep society the way it is now, but tweak some happy folk so that they can thrive in this society, you can make them not care about certain things (like eliminating ennui and existential quandries by making them pure lizard brain) or you can make them overcome their problems (like eliminating ennui by making them super-social and fun loving). But both solutions fundamentally change the society they are adopting to.
