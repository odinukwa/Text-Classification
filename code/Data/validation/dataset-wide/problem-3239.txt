That he correctly portrayed Stalin (and his political enforcers) as someone who saw his own people as a resource to be used and wasted as he saw fit. He cared little for his own people and everything for his own image. In terms of human genocide he's right up there with the very worst of the 20th century alongside Mao and Hitler. It's no coincidence that the loss of Russian life was almost as much as the German and allied losses put together. No surprise then that the Russians don't think particularly highly of anyone who might criticise him. 

JFW I'm not sure what you're asking for here, 'the German perspective' in what sense? The German army made some serious strategic errors in their attempt to 'take' Stalingrad most of which I might add were fueled by Hitlers arrogance in his own military ability, a mistrust in his own Generals' ability and his petulance in wanting to take Stalingrad as quickly as possible to 'teach Stalin a lesson' and break the will of the Russian people. The Germans used their usual 'blitzkreig' tactics of hitting the city with Panzer divisions and infantry supported by the luftwaffe but made the fatal mistake of almost bombing the city into oblivion which hindered their later progress of clearing the city of Russian resistance which basically took too long. The Russians (what was left of them) dug in and fought a guerilla war in the bombed out remains of the city which meant that the two most powerful parts of the German military machine, the Panzers and Luftwaffe could not be deployed. The harsh winter weather played its part in effectively cutting off the German supply lines and they had to be increasingly resupplied by air which wasn't practical in terms of the weather. This allowed the Russians sufficient time to move other Russian armies into position to encircle the Germans both inside and outside Stalingrad thus cutting off any hope of the trapped German armies inside Stalingrad from being reinforced or evacuated. The Germans made too many mistakes and underestimated the resolve (and sheer quantity of potential reinforcements) of the Russian army. If you want any one particular reason it was Hitlers arrogance and over-confidence. 

The main reason that Germany won so decisively in early battles was due to Blitzkrieg tactics and the way their armour was organised. The French tended to use their tanks in defensive positions that negated the advantage of mobility and they spread them out so tanks were not concentrated together. This meant when French tanks did engage German armour they were almost always fighting against superior numbers. The Panzer IV was the most advanced German tank produced before the war: $URL$ Total numbers were around 200 before the outbreak of war. Strangely the Germans didn't learn the lessons of the Blitzkrieg themselves and when faced with the more agile and numerous Russian T34 tank they produced slower and more expensive tanks that were always going to be outnumbered. 

I wouldn't be at all surprised if the term originates from the Tudor period of Henry the VIII whose emblem of the House of Tudor was the red rose. This excerpt from the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) does indeed point to it: 

Speed with greater numbers and fear is the primary answer here. The marching columns main purpose was to simply get to the enemy as fast as possible and overwhelm them with superior numbers. The huge columns of soldiers marching to a rhythmic drumbeat would strike fear into the hearts of any opponent. The high casualty rate of this kind of tactic was justified by the speed of victory and was less significant for the French due to their superior numbers. Bottom line - it was a sledge hammmer to crack a nut. This of course didn't work particularly well against the British, despite their inferior numbers, due to their far higher discipline and better training (they didn't break and run so easily) and their greater volley firing rate. All British redcoats could fire 3 musket balls a minute - far better than any other army. 

After the defeat of France in 1940, Hitler concluded a deal with the French that saw the creation of Vichy France. What was the reasoning behind this resolution? Oviously there must have been some benefits for the Germans but were there any disadvantages to the agreement? Please put forward the pros and cons and what the effects (if any) there were to the war as a whole. 

There's no clear-cut definitive answer for this as most battles involved mass ranks of soldiers and not individual targets. Archers would be trained to shoot at groups of enemy and not individuals, at least not at any great range. The English/Welsh Longbow of the early 15th century, had a range of up to 350 yds or so, but it was only considered effective at up to around 200 yds. This doesn't take into account armour worn by the enemy. For example a knight in full plate armour would probably be impervious to the Longbow at ranges of much above 50 yds, depending on the type of arrowhead used. $URL$ $URL$ 

Firstly, the Zimmerman telegram was real and sent, he admitted so himself at a press conference. Secondly, it was a feint to turn Americas attention away from the war in Europe and towards a possible one against Mexico. Germany feared Americas involvement in the war and wanted to ensure they were more concerned with one closer to home. There was no serious plans from Germany at all to support a war between Mexico and America. Thirdly, The American government thought the telegram was fake when told about it by the British government and thought it was a ruse being used by the British to involve America in a war most of their population were against. 

German tanks were generally inferior to Allied and Soviet designs in the pre-war years. The Germans were limited in what they could build due to the restrictions imposed upon them by the Treaty of Versailles, limiting their military. Indeed this treaty stated that they were not allowed any tanks at all but in the 1930s as they began to re-arm the treaty was largely ignored. When Germany invaded France in 1940, their tanks were inferior to the French (and British) designs as this quote from Wikipedia (and Heinz Guderian) illustrates: 

The tank was one major development that helped break through the trenches. The British Mk1 tank was employed with some degree of success at the Battle of Cambrai for example: $URL$ The British gained more ground here in six hours than they gained in three months at Ypres for example. However, due to lack of infantry support most of the ground gained was lost to a German counter-attack soon afterwards. 

Wiki Source It was just another contributing factor that led up to the French Revolution so it's worth researching the causes of that as well. Ironic that France in trying to weaken her old enemy Britain actually contributed to the downfall of her own monarchy. 

The IMF wasn't complicit in it at all, it merely lent Ceaușescu's government money to invest in industrialisation - the investment of which which was mismanaged. Did Ceaușescu have to continue austerity measures despite the loans having been repaid to the IMF? IF so how is the IMF complicit? For demanding those loans be repaid? Look to Ceaușescu's inefficient handling of government and industrial investment (and likely financial embezzlement) as the prime cause and not the IMF. 

Operation Barbarossa was arguably the main event of World War - had Germany succeeded, they could possibly have gone on to win the war. They ultimately failed, but what were the major reasons for this failure? Was the whole operation doomed from the start? 

The whole operation was doomed from the start because the Allies at Bletchley Park had deciphered the German plans for the attack. The British gave the Russians ample warning time of this, although the Russians already knew about it as they had spies of their own within British intelligence. $URL$ Given that the Russians had several weeks forewarning, they amassed tanks, guns and soldiers in great number and prepared many layers of defence lines to defeat the German assault. Had the Germans never launched Zitadelle they would have preserved their precious tanks and probably prolonged the war although the end result would have been the same. Hitler made the right decision on this occasion, by calling the operation off, but he should have done so sooner. 

Did the North's population outnumber the South, or merely have more men available to be conscripted into the army to fight? The answer to this question is less about industrialisation and more about the availability of qualified men able to be conscripted into the army to fight. The southern states had a totally different economy to the north and was based primarily on slave labour. This slave labour, consisting mostly of African-American (is that the correct term?) descent were not available to join the army and fight. It's true the confederate Army did enlist some slaves towards the end of the war, but at the beginning the Confederate Army consisted mostly of non-slaves. This is the reason for the larger Union Armies compared to the Confederate ones. 

How was Russian AFV production affected by the relocation of factories during WWII, post the German invasion of 1941? They went on to out-produce the Germans by around 3-1 in tanks from 1942 onwards. Assuming that the Russians hadn't relocated their factories, how would AFV production have been affected on both sides? Could the Germans have used captured tank factories to produce their own tanks? Did the Germans consider bombing "Tankograd"? - It is a ~2k mile round trip from Moscow, so did they even have the capability? (I am aware the He-177 had nearly that range) 

To me one of the many crucial stages of WWII was when the Luftwaffe were no longer able to mount serious resistance to the Allied bombing raids. While the effect of the raids if often debated, it certainly led to a shortage of fuel that compounded the situation as they could never recover as the lack of fuel led to a lack of trained pilots. The Allies began concentrating on the Axis fuel supply and manufacturing industries around mid-1944 according to Wikipedia, was this the significant date? 

Gaddafi spent Libyas oil millions on his own image, self importance, family and military whilst his population were suppressed, imprisoned, tortured and left to starve. I don't think the West's view of Gaddafi is distorted at all. Whether it was right for the West to interfere in a country that was not their concern is a different issue and question. 

Firstly, I think you may be getting a little confused between life peers and hereditary peers. Life peers are given a peerage or title for their lifetime only. It is not hereditary and it cannot be handed down to their children. When that person dies, the peerage or title dies with them. They are not expected to maintain a country estate or multiple houses, nor are they necessarily expected to be wealthy. The cost you refer to I believe is probably constituted from an honour fee paid, for the priviledge of becoming a peer which probably covers the administrative charges, charge for the warrant and possibly also the fee for a coat of arms or heraldry from the College of Heralds. In addition to that would also be the cost of regalia when needed and worn on public occasions. The cost of all that added up could well constitute a considerable sum of money. Hereditary peers are in a similar position but the initial cost of being made one will already have been paid and their main concern is the upkeep of the family seat or family home which would have been passed down to them through the generations. Many peers have found that these old country homes and castles are simply so expensive to maintain they've had to sell them to English Heritage, who maintain them but open them to the public. Some have had to sell them to private individuals simply because they have insufficient funds to maintain them. Just because a country seat has been sold, does not mean a hereditary peerage or titles goes with it. It does not, it remains with the peer until death and is then inherited by their son or sometimes daughter.
