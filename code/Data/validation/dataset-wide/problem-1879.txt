It's certainly worth discussing. How much flexibility the hiring manager has to negotiate vacation days really depends on the company. Larger companies are more likely to have rules about the maximum number of vacation days any employee can accrue in a year (and/or how many can be carried over from one calendar year to another). In general, figure that there are roughly 200 business days per year. That means that 1 vacation day is worth roughly 1/200 (0.5%) of your annual salary. That's obviously a rough estimate but it's in the right ballpark to begin negotiations. As far as how to negotiate extra vacation time goes, you would approach it the same way you would approach salary negotiations. If the company gives you an offer, you can counter that the salary is acceptable but that you need an extra week or an extra two weeks of vacation. Negotiating over fringe benefits is basically the same same as negotiating over salary. 

First, check to see whether your company has a policy about not giving references at all. Most large-ish companies in the US (and many smaller ones) have general policies that the only references they'll provide are from HR who will only confirm dates of employment and titles. If your company has such a policy, you can simply inform your friend that you don't want to violate company policy on references. If that's not an available out, it's far kinder to tell your friend that you can't give a really enthusiastic recommendation is far kinder than silently torpedoing her chances. Since you were just coworkers at the same level, you might try pointing out that a reference from a supervisor is going to carry far more weight with a potential employer than a reference from a coworker. If she insists (presumably because she knows the manager would give a poor reference), this might also give you some cover to decline to answer certain types of questions. Since you weren't a party to every discussion between your coworker and her manager, it's perfectly reasonable to decline to answer certain types of questions in a reference check. For example, if you weren't responsible for setting and monitoring her hours, it's reasonable to personally find it inappropriate for her to come in at a later time but to avoid questions about punctuality because you weren't privy to all the conversations between the employee and management-- it's possible, for example, that her manager didn't care that much if she was regularly coming in a few minutes later than everyone else. You can tell her that you'll diplomatically decline to talk about punctuality, in that case, because that wasn't something that you were responsible for dealing with. Additionally, references generally only get contacted at the very end of the interview process, it's generally pretty easy to figure out that one of your references is undercutting you when a candidate finds that offers are getting pulled once references get contacted so the silent torpedoing also doesn't spare your friend's feelings for long. Instead, she'll most likely feel even more betrayed when she finds out that you agreed to give her a reference and ended up undercutting her once she had a job or two lined up. If you were colleagues, it seems unlikely that she would be completely blindsided by your constructive criticism. Surely, if you found something she did (or didn't) do so bad that you can't in good conscience recommend her to a different employer, you would have told her about it when you were working together, right? 

You manage this employee so it's your responsibility to have a conversation and explain the problem to this employee. This needs to be a private conversation when you're not upset so that the conversation remains professional and you two can work together to figure out how to solve the problem. Based on your example, it may benefit you to ask a more specific question and to coach the employee to ask some questions before answering. In your example, you asked a very generic question, how a spreadsheet was set up. You got a very generic answer that tried to cover the complete process. You actually wanted an answer to a very specific question, where the data came from. Had you asked a very specific question, you might have been given a specific (and shorter) answer. Had the employee paused to ask some followups about exactly what you wanted, he might have realized you wanted a more specific answer. 

It depends on why people are getting cc'd. If the original sender is cc-ing people in order to escalate an issue, failing to include them on the reply is only going to create more work for you and more frustration for the people on the cc list. If someone is cc-ing your manager, for example, and you just reply directly, then as far as your manager is aware, someone escalated an issue and you haven't done anything about it. That means that your manager has to follow up with you to find out what's going on. And then your manager potentially has to communicate that status to other people that were on the original email. That's a lot of extra work for your manager to do that you could have eliminated with a Reply All. Of course, there are other times where doing a Reply All would be rude. If people were cc'd because it was a wide distribution (a corporate announcement, for example), replying to everyone will make be a mistake. 

I don't understand what is causing you to worry. It sounds like your team lead had a private meeting with you to explicitly address the concerns you might have about the new hire. It sounds like your team lead has done everything possible to tell you that your job is safe (at least as safe as any job ever is). It sounds like your team lead wanted to tell you in person before a job posting was created or a candidate was interviewed just to make sure that you didn't jump to conclusions. Presumably, they'll let the department know when a new person is actually hired. It would be odd to tell the entire department about every job posting that the department creates, it makes much more sense to wait until there is an actual person coming in to fill a role to announce the hire to the department. And that often comes long after the actual hire-- if the department has quarterly meetings, they may be announcing new hires that you've been working with for a few months. Is it possible that your team lead is reassuring you just to get you to stick around long enough to transition to the new person? Sure, it's possible. It would be pretty poor behavior on his or her part. But there are psychopaths in the world so it can't be completely discounted. Everyone can be replaced and everyone should be prepared for the possibility of a job loss. Being paranoid about the possibility, though, probably does you no favors. 

This is probably impossible to answer because it generally depends heavily on the specifics of the organization. What one company calls a "team lead" another company might call a "manager" while other organizations may not make any sort of distinction between the two. Broadly, though, if an organization makes a distinction between the two roles, it is likely that a "team lead" would be someone that spends part of their time doing the same thing that members of the team are doing and part of their time doing management tasks while a "manager" would be someone that no longer spends a significant fraction of their time doing the same things that the members of their team are doing in order to focus almost exclusively on management tasks. A "team lead" probably doesn't have HR responsibility for the members of the team (so the "team lead" probably doesn't do annual performance reviews, doesn't have responsibility for hiring and firing, etc.) while a "manager" probably does. As I said initially, though, the exact parameters are likely to vary from one organization to another. There is no guarantee that one organization's "manager" isn't going to be spending a significant amount of time doing the same work their team is responsible for. And it's entirely possible that another organization's "team lead" is going to be responsible for hiring and firing. 

As with all things, it depends. If you want your site to show off your technical skills, having a dedicated technology site is probably the best case if only because it makes it easier for interviewers and potential colleagues to browse through the posts you want them looking at without needing to look at the posts that don't have any technical information. What you probably need to look at, though, is how much better separate sites are to you vs. how much of a pain it is to keep two sites separate. That's likely a much closer call. What fraction of the posts are technical content? If "more 'technical stuff' than anything" means that 99% of the posts are technical with 1% other, that would lean toward keeping a single site. The other content isn't likely to get in the way of someone that wants to browse just the technical bits. On the other hand, if it's more like a 60% technical content/ 40% other split, that probably leans toward keeping a separate site since it's likely that someone may end up looking at quite a few posts that don't do anything to show your technology skills particularly if they're browsing over a date range. What sort of "opinion/ health/ life experience" content are you posting? No one is likely to bat an eye if you have the occasional post about a trip you took while on vacation accompanied by some photographs of the local landmarks. On the other hand, if a significant fraction of your opinion posts are dealing with controversial political questions or personal religious thoughts, giving potential interviewers a link to your site may come across as much more aggressive than you probably intend. If you're making occasional health-related posts about training for a 10k, that's very different than posting about struggling with a chronic disease-- one is likely to humanize you for a potential interviewer, the other is likely to make an interviewer a bit uncomfortable about knowing too much about your personal life before you've even met. How big a deal is it to you to maintain two separate sites? Presumably, there would be a fair amount of effort initially to separate the technical and non-technical posts. As an ongoing effort, though, are you likely to find it annoying to switch back and forth constantly? Are you going to have posts that could go on either site? If the benefits are minimal, these costs probably outweigh the benefits. If the benefits are larger, the effort is probably worthwhile. 

Most good programmers are already employed. They're taking vacation time, realistically, to come to the interview. You'd be asking them to take another vacation day to work with you (unless you plan on them doing their time-limited tasks after they put in a full day at their current employer). Then you'd be asking them to take a week of vacation to work with you for a week which likely also takes some time to arrange. And only then, after burning through a large chunk of their vacation hours, you would potentially offer them a probationary contract that would allow them to consider giving two weeks notice at their current employer. That certainly reduces your risk of hiring someone that isn't going to be productive but it means that the candidate is taking a tremendous risk. Of course, it creates a number of risks for you. There is some intellectual property risk. Depending on the candidate's current employment agreement, you might find that their current employer has rights to the code that they write for you. There is a timing risk. You're going to have to wait for them to arrange a vacation day and then to arrange a vacation week and then to put in their notice before they can stat their probationary contract. That's a fair amount of waiting and coordinating. If you're a slow-moving Fortune 500, that might not be a huge issue. If you're a fast-moving startup, an interview process that stretches over a month or two would be problematic. If you decide that you'll only hire folks that are currently unemployed, which will severely restrict the pool of solid candidates, then you just have the logistical problems. Getting a new employee set up is a fair amount of work particularly when you're going to measure their first day output and can't afford a hiccup when something doesn't work smoothly. And there is a lot of employment paperwork that needs to happen to make sure that you do the proper witholding, send out the proper tax forms at the end of the year, you've got the appropriate NDAs an the like. From the employee standpoint, the extra work involved in doing a single day of contract work may well cost them more in tax preparation fees than they'd make. And that may interfere with their unemployment benefits. And unless you are doing something terribly repetitive and uninteresting, expecting someone to deliver a lot of value in a single day or a single week is probably optimistic. People take time to come up to speed on an existing code base, understand your architecture, get their environment set up for maximum productivity, etc. If you're just asking them to make small tweaks in very localized pieces of code based on fully developed specs, that might be enough time. But that won't tell you a whole lot about their ability to do the more involved tasks that you're likely hiring them for. 

The vague job description has to do with the economics of employing a staffing firm. The staffing firm gets paid only if they refer the candidate that gets hired. If the staffing firm expends the time and effort to locate one of the 25 people on Earth that have experience with a particular topic, they don't want the target to then submit their resume to the employer and deny the staffing firm their rightful commission. As to why the employer doesn't list the position on their web site, there are a variety of potential answers. Often, employers find that they get an avalanche of resumes that are poorly suited to the position and have to expend a large amount of effort in order to sort through them looking for people worth following up with. Outsourcing that work to the staffing firm can sometimes be well worth it. Other times, employers don't want to signal to the world that they're hiring for a particular position. If Amazon decided tomorrow that they wanted to build their own cell phone, for example, they might want to assemble the team quietly rather than posting a bunch of job openings that would make it clear to competitors that they were starting such a project. Still other times, a company may be looking to replace an existing employee or for a position that would signal some sort of internal reorganization where the company wants to make an announcement once they have made a hire rather than when they start looking. If you advertise that you're looking for a new CFO, your existing CFO will probably be a bit upset, for example. 

You're definitely better off not including emoticons in correspondence with potential employers. Employers want to see that you are going to be able to communicate professionally with clients and most clients would be put off by the presence of emoticons in business communication. Although some employers will simply ignore emoticons, you're much better off if the text of your message conveys whatever emotions you intend to express without needing to resort to emoticons. Something like sarcasm or jokes probably ought not be in professional communication in the first place because of the risk that it will be taken the wrong way by the recipient. Even if the employer tries to ignore the emoticons, they will likely assume that you are less mature and a less capable communicator than another candidate that writes exactly the same message without emoticons. 

Your plan is correct-- keep your mouth shut. You're not seeing anything that this individual isn't seeing. You don't know anything he doesn't know. Presumably, your co-worker looks in the mirror at least a couple of times a day. He knows what medical conditions he has been diagnosed with already and whether his doctor already told him to expect this. He is perfectly capable of talking with a doctor if he is becoming jaundiced unexpectedly. If he's been diagnosed with some sort of liver problem (I certainly wouldn't assume alcoholism though that is certainly possible), having random folks come up to him to let him know that he sure looks terrible aren't going to be comforting. 

It's not unprofessional to decline a job offer. It is unprofessional, though, to look for a job that you have no intention of taking regardless of the offer. Now, realistically, it's unlikely that anyone would know whether you're interviewing just for practice and that you'll go on to graduate school regardless of the offer or whether you're honestly considering your options. You're wasting the time of everyone you meet with and forcing them to do a lot of work that they wouldn't do if you were forthright with them. But as long as you don't admit to your motives, it's unlikely that it would negatively affect you. If you turn down a position at a particular company, that may affect your ability to get a job at that company in the future. Policies depend, of course, on the company along with the job that you're applying for now vs. the job you turned down and how much time has passed. It's unlikely to disqualify you but a company may be hesitant to hire you now if you thought it was a poor fit in the past-- that might lead the company to believe that you're only settling for them now and that you'll be moving on to a different position shortly. Applying for a different position years later will be less of a concern than if you apply again in a few months for the same position because you're finding graduate school less interesting than you expected.
