It's been a while since I read Elsholtz's article, but after doing so I felt none the wiser. Below I have translated Heath-Brown's proof into the language of binary quadratic forms; Zagier's proof looks more interesting from this point of view (the connections to Gauss reduction are much closer), but when working out the details I got stuck in the middle. One essential ingredient for the proofs by Heath-Brown and Zagier was pointed out already by Frick in 1918, who showed that if $p = a^2 + 4b^2$ is an odd prime number, then the indefinite binary quadratic form $Q = (-b,a,b)$ with discriminant $p$ is Gauss reduced and is contained in the principal cycle. For proving that such a form exists without assuming that $p$ is a sum of two squares, we consider all forms $(A,B,C)$ with discriminant $p$ such that $A < 0$ and $C > 0$. From $p = B^2 - 4AC$ it then follows that the set $$ S = \{(A,B,C): B^2 - 4AC = p, A < 0, C > 0\} $$ is finite. The obvious map $$ \mu: S \to S, \quad (A,B,C) \to (-C,B,-A) $$ is an involution; if $S$ had odd cardinality, it would follow that $\mu$ has a fixed point, say $(A,B,-A)$, from which we would get $p = B^2 + 4A^2$. Unfortunately, $S$ has even cardinality since the involution $$ \nu: S \to S, \quad (A,B,C) \to (A,-B,C) $$ has no fixed points: this is because $B = 0$ implies $p = 4AC$, which is impossible for prime numbers $p$. We now would like to find a subset $U \subset S$ of $S$ with odd cardinality on which $\mu$ is still defined. The most natural idea would be considering the forms with $B > 0$. For showing that this set of forms has odd cardinality, we have to define an involution $(A,B,C) \to (A',B',C')$ on this subset that has exactly one fixed point. To find such an involution, we start with $(A,B,C) \to (A,-B,C)$ and then apply reduction by changing the middle coefficient modulo $2A$ and then adjusting the last coefficient so that the discriminant is $p$. This gives $$ (A,-B,C) \to (A',B',C') = (A,-2A-B,A+B+C). $$ Now we are facing the problem that it is not clear at all that $B' = -2A-B > 0$, or that $C' = A+B+C > 0$. But if we set $$ U = \{(A,B,C) \in S: A+B+C > 0 \}, $$ then the map $$ \gamma: (A,B,C) \to (A,-2A-B,A+B+C) $$ actually is an involution on $U$. Moreover, $(A,B,C)$ is a fixed point if and only if $-2A-B = B$ and $A+B+C = C$, which is equivalent to $A = -B$. Since $p = B^2 - 4AC = B^2 + 4BC = B(B+4C)$ is prime, we must have $|A| = |B| = 1$. Since $A < 0$, this implies that the fixed point is $(-1,1,\frac{p-1}4)$; this form is equivalent to the principal form $(1,1,\frac{p-1}4)$. The involution $\gamma$ on $U$ shows that $U$ has odd cardinality; the map $$ (A,B,C) \to (-C,-B,-A) $$ is an involution on $S$ sending $U$ to $S \setminus U$, which impliesthat $|S| = 2 |U|$. The involution $\nu$ on $S$ sends elements with $B > 0$ to elements with $B < 0$, hence $$ T = \{(A,B,C) \in S: B > 0\} $$ has the same number of elements as $U$, and in particular, it has odd cardinality. Finally, $\mu$ is an involution on $T$, and now the Two-Squares Theorem follows. References 

My interpretation of this is that Fermat lists four results which he believes can be proved using his method of descent. In my opinion this implies that Fermat did not have a proof of FLT for exponent $3$ in 1659. Edit 2 In light of the discission at wiki.fr let me add a couple of additional remarks along with a promise that a nonelectronic publication of my views on Fermat will appear within the next two years (if I can find a publisher, that is). A search in google books for "hanc marginis" and Fermat for the years up to 1900 reveals several hits, none of which claims that the remark was written around 1637; in particular there are no dates given in Fermat's Oeuvres or in Heath's Diophantus. Starting with Dickson's history, this changes dramatically, and nowadays the date 1637 seems to be firmly attached to this entry. The dating of the entry seems to come from a letter written by Fermat to J. de Sainte-Croix via Mersenne mentioned in Nurdin's answer; this letter is not dated, but since Descartes, in a letter to Mersenne from 1638, refers to a result he credits to Sainte-Croix, but which Fermat claims he has discovered, it is believed that Fermat's letter to Mersenne was written well before that date. The reasons for dating it to September 1636 are not explained in Fermat's Oeuvres. In this letter, Fermat poses the problem of finding two fourth powers whose sum is a fourth power, and of finding two cubes whose sum is a cube. The reasoning seems to be that in 1636, Fermat had not yet found (or believed to have found) a proof of the general theorem, so the entry must have been written at a later date. Since he did not refer to the general theorem in any of his existant letters, it is also believed that he soon found his mistake, so the entry cannot have been written at a time when Fermat was mature enough to find sufficiently difficult proofs. Let me also add that the following dates can be deduced from Fermat's letters: 

In some notes of mine I have found a comment according to which the Indian mathematician Narayana Pandit (14th century) found the prime factors of $1161$ by writing it in the form $1161 = 35^2-8^2$. Unfortunately I can't find the source of this piece of information. Any help is appreciated. 

Gauss's (unpublished and largely unknown) proof of the quartic reciprocity law probably used lattice point arguments. The details were supplied by several authors at the end of the 19th century (for references, see e.g. Hill's article below). A modern approach using geometric ideas similar to those above was provided in several articles by R. Hill, such as this one. Edit (2015). For reconstructions of Gauss's ideas see the recently published book Gauss's reciprocity laws in number theory (in German). 

"Proof by example" is a technique used by Euclid, who often proved results that hold e.g. for n integers in a typical case, say for 3 integers, as well as by Diophantus, who had to choose values for his parameters due to his lack of algebraic notation. I regard both versions as complete proofs. This is apparently not what Fraser is referring to; Euler did generalize from examples to theorems in his Algebra, where he transferred correct results from "rings of integers" ${\mathbb Z}[i]$ to general quadratic rings without proof; but Euler wrote his algebra when he was old and completely blind, and perhaps it is fair to say that Euler was collecting evidence for his "method" rather than regarding these examples as proofs. I am not aware of a single example where Euler explicitly said that he regarded the verification of examples as a proof, but I only have read his number theoretical work in detail. The idea that Lagrange proved results by examples is ridiculous. 

Just as a minor warning: even if the conductor is $1$, there might be nontrivial roots of unity in the class field: take $K = {\mathbb q}(\sqrt{-5}\,)$ and ${\mathfrak c} = (1)$; then the ray class field is the Hilbert class field $K(\sqrt{-1})$, which contains the 4th roots of unity. The roots of unity in the Hilbert class field (i.e. for conductor $1$) lie in the genus class field and can be computed easily. Any additional roots of unity must come from ramified extensions; a necessary condition for the $p$-th roots of unity to lie in the ray class field must be that the ry class number, which is easily computed, be divisible by $p-1$ (or $(p-1)/2$ if the genus class field contains the quadratic subfield of the $p$-th roots of unity). 

There are several questions in the Euler-Goldbach correspondence that I am unable to answer. Sometimes it does not take very much: in his letter to Goldbach dated June 9th, 1750, Euler conjectured that every odd number can be written as a sum of four squares in such a way that $n = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ and $a+b+c+d = 1$. I was just about to post this to MO when I saw that Euler's conjecture can be reduced to the Three-Squares Theorem in one line (am I supposed to spoil this right away?). Here's another one where I haven't found a proof yet. In his letter to Goldbach dated Apr.15, 1747, Euler wrote: The theorem Any number of the form $4m+2$ can always be split into two parts such as $4x+1$ and $4y+1$, none of which has any divisor of the form $4p-1$'' (which does not appear difficult, although I cannot yet prove it). Later, Euler attributed to Goldbach the much stronger claim that the two summands can be chosen to be prime, which is a strong form of the Goldbach conjecture. Euler's intention was proving the Four-Squares Theorem (which he almost did. Assuming this result, write $4m+2 = a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2$; then congruences modulo $8$ show that two numbers on the right hand side, say $a$ and $b$, are even, and the other two are odd. Now $a^2 + c^2 = 4x+1$ and $b^2 + d^2 = 4y+1$ satisfy Euler's conditions except when $a$ and $c$ (or $b$ and $d$) have a common prime factor of the form $4n-1$. Can this be excluded somehow? Hermite [Oeuvres I, p. 259] considered a similar problem: Tout nombre impair est decomposable en quatre carres et, parmi ces decompositions, il en existe toujours de telles que la somme de deux carrees soit sans diviseurs communs avec la somme de deux autres. (Every odd number can be decomposed into four squares, and among these decompositions, there always exist some for which the sum of two squares is coprime to the sum of the other two.) Hermite's proof contains a gap. Can Hermite's claim be proved somehow?
