The "Federal Taxes" row shows that the upper quintile tax bill is higher than the tax bill of the other four quintiles combined. (the data are averages but each quintile has same number of households so those numbers are enough to conclude this). The figure below show this more clearly, in percentage terms: Check here for older reports. PS: amazingly, the top quintile gets more government transfers than the poorest quintile, which get the lowest. An entirely regressive system! 

Regarding the general question in the title, the reasons why "the same" variable vary across sources depends very much on the particular variable you are talking about. Personally, one of my first shocks when I started working after my undergraduate was the high number of ways the same conceptual variable studied theoretically (e.g. inflation) could be measured in practice. These alternative definitions might refer to slightly different phenomena, or might reflect different set of assumptions by those computing the statistics. Depending on your ontological position when it comes to economic concepts (e.g. is there such a thing as "inflation" out there?), you can argue that some assumptions are better than others. But this does not deny the fact that there are potentially many ways to measure the same variable, and different institutions/individual might prefer one over the other. Focusing in the case of GDP for Iran in particular, there is the "original" GDP (as coming from official or primary sources) in local currency (notice there are several definitions of GDP too, and in the case of Iran, one with and without oil production). For international comparison purposes, this metric needs to be transformed into e.g. current US\$ or PPP US\$, process which involves some assumptions (e.g. which exchange rate to use?). Again, different institutions might use different metrics and prefer different assumptions. As said below, for data coming from countries using the Islamic calendar, there are further complications when translating to the Gregorian calendar. Let us dig deeper in the case of Iran's GDP. First, you need to start with the official data (or primary source), available in the website of the Statistical Center of Iran. If you select the file for GDP at current prices (this file), you get the quarterly data for GDP in current Iranian currency. Notice however, that this data corresponds to the Islamic year, which is different from the Gregorian calendar used in most of the world (and used in the websites you mention). The former starts around the 21st of March of the latter. This is not exactly the end of the first quarter of the Gregorian calendar. Since quarterly data is the minimum frequency of the Iranian GDP, there is no exact way to convert quarterly Islamic-based GDP into annual Gregorian-based GDP. This tells you immediately that the translation exercise is by definition an approximation. One reasonable approximation is to use the last quarter of an Iranian year and the first three quarters of the next Iranian year to produce a metric of the Gregorian-based year GDP. For 2015, this is: 

So they usually reflect only food, clothing and housing costs. Do not include transport or education. However, it depends on how each country defines the national poverty line. Apparently the WB does not alter these lines. 

(Source here). Similarly, there was an increase in workers productivity in the manufacturing sector in Q4 of 2016, which slowed down considerably in Q1 of 2017: 

1x2 model Consider a mode where production of a single good is given by a constant returns to scale CES production function: $$Y=A(\alpha L^\rho +(1-\alpha)K^\rho)^{\frac{1}{\rho}}$$ where the elasticity of substitution between the two factors is $$ \sigma = \frac{1}{1-\rho} $$ It can be shown that the marginal product of labour (equal to the real wage in a competitive economy) is $$ MP_{L} = A\alpha \left( \frac{Y}{L}\right)^{1-\rho} $$ To understand the consequences of biased technical change on real wages, we need to look at the three components separately. For simplicity, let's assume a fixed supply of labour, $\bar{L}$. Now, a technical change that improves productivity of both factors, but more that of capital is such that $A$ increases (the neutral component), and $\alpha$ falls (the bias). On top of this, any increase in productivity (regardless of its bias) will increase $Y$. Yet, labour is fixed. Then, you have that the three determinants of the real wage change. In particular, two are increasing and one is falling. The change in the real wage - and the nature of growth (enriching, immiserizing, neutral) depend on how these play-out. In particular, the greater the bias, the smaller the neutral technical change, and the higher the elasticity of substitution (higher $\rho$), the more likely you will have immiserizing growth. If $\rho = 1$, the third term disappears altogether. 2x2 model You can get similar results by having a 2x2 model (2 goods and 2 inputs). For instance, say that capital productivity increases more than labour productivity. Furthermore, say that the elasticity of consumption among the two goods ($Y_{a}$ and $Y_{b}$) is very high. For example, individuals are willing to consume a lot of the former and little of the latter. If the production of $Y_{a}$ is very intensive on capital, and the technology has a high degree of substitution between capital and labour (so firms could produce by expanding capital and not much expanding labour), then you will end up with a reduction in aggregate demand for labour. This will lead to a fall in the real wage, and an absolute loss of income for workers (i.e. immiserizing growth). Thus, in the end you can get any type of behaviour depending on: 

Take your starting nominal GDP series in local currency units (e.g. Euros), and use the PPP rates to transform local currency units into nominal US dollars. You can find PPP rates here or here. Use the US GDP deflator (or a price index) to transform nominal GDP in USD into real GDP in USD. The base year is given by the chosen price index. 

If you are interested on mean wages, then the third component does not apply. The other two do. Thus, a lot of the problem is due to prices issues. As the authors note: 

I have never seen any "serious" (i.e. peer-reviewed) study defining independent variables as the end of the period under consideration (if you could provide some link to the ones you are referring to, it would be helpful). Normally, they are used as the average over the period or at the initial year. For instance, in the big field of finance and growth, that is the common approach. Thorsten Beck - among the most renown researchers in this field - says it himself (bottom half of page 2). There are many examples of this in other fields too. For instance, when estimating inequality on growth (top of page 282), or the famous paper by Xala-i-Martin, where he run 4 million growth regressions. Look in page 7 and 8, in sections "Data" and "Choosing the Fixed Variables". Now, why not to use final period variables? Because of reverse causality concerns. An economy which grows fast over a given period might end up with a higher savings rate and human capital level at the end of the period. As such, the order of causality is in fact the opposite at the one your equation is assuming (even though the sign coming from estimations might be the same!), leading to endogeneity and therefore to inconsistent estimates. Even the use of average period variables is subject to some controversy. As Xala-i-Martin puts it in the aforementioned paper (page 8): 

There is some research on this area. Overall, the effect of natural disasters on stock markets depend on type of disaster, industry, and country. For example, this paper studies 30 natural disasters, from a variety of countries (including Hurricane Katrina, in the US). It concludes: 

The fund was to be accumulated by holding a proportion of companies’ profits (originally, 20 per cent before tax), which were to be issued as new shares. This was basically an expansion of equity, to be owned commonly by all workers in the economy. After a few decades, this method would leave most of the (equity-based) companies in the hands of workers. So in effect, this was ultimately a socialisation of the ownership of firms. Quite a bold program. In the end, a reduced version was introduced in 1984, which lasted only for seven years. The fund was privatised by a right-wing government in 1992. You can read more about this here and here. 

$$ \hat{S}_{t+h|t} = S_t \left(1+ \pi^e_{t,h} \right)^h \quad h>0 $$ where $\pi^e_{t,h}$ is the forecast of inflation, for example, from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. 

(The red is the personal income tax set by law, and the blue is the one adding tax credits, as far as I understand). As you can see, rates in Canada are quite high in comparison with other OECD countries like Estonia or Poland, and also higher than the UK. Also, in international comparison, Canada is quite good in redistributing income. You can see that by comparing the Gini index before and after taxation: 

Finally, Chapter 8 deals with Government services like health and education, There is a differentiation between individual services (household consumed) and collective services (public goods). Most of education and health as services provided to the individual is the former, whereas others like R&D in education and health is the latter. See Box 1 in Chapter 8 for a complete list. The valuation of these services is an issue. A quote in extenso might help here: 

GDP refers to income associated to particular geography (or residence). GNI refers to income associated to a particular set of individuals (citizens), regardless of where they earn their income. Since geography and citizenship do not fully overlap, they might be different: 

The convention in finance is that any currency pair "currency1/currency2" is to be interpreted as the number of units of currency2 needed to buy one unit of currency1, or alternatively, as the number of currency2 you get from selling one unit of currency1. For instance, as of 13th of Match of 2017, the currency pair rate of exchange between the £ and the US $ (GBP/USD) was roughly 1.22. This means that you need 1.22 US dollars to buy £1. Under this convention, a fall/increase in the GBP/USD means a depreciation/appreciation of the British Pound with respect to the US Dollar. So, using your example, if the GBP/USD goes up from 3 to 5, then the British Pound appreciates with respect to the US Dollar. By contrast, the convention in economics is to define the exchange rate as £x/\$1, meaning that you need x British Pounds to buy 1 US Dollar, or that you can sell 1 US Dollar for x British Pounds. Under this convention, an increase/fall in £x/\$1 means a depreciation/appreciation of the British Pound with respect to the US Dollar. In other words, the interpretation is exactly the opposite. 

For a reference bundle $A$ (equivalent to $\{2,3\}$), the gray regions indicate the areas of indifference, based on your definition of preferences (the black lines are part of the indifference areas). Thus, by selecting any bundle, you can find the indifference "areas" by plotting the vertical and horizontal lines across that point. Areas to the North-West and South-East will always be the indifference "areas". 

Simple correlation is not a good approach to evaluate the Phillips curve, because you are mixing many periods together. To get a better grasp of what this relationship might have been in the past, use a graphical approach. I suggest you to do something like this: 

(source here) It seems that developing countries might have lower capital-output ratios. However, this is ultimately an empirical question which requires a proper analysis. I suggest you use the KLEMS data to make your own, harmonised study. 

Aggregating across these lines is not enough. You need to make them comparable. That is where the PPP comes in. 

Maybe the case of Germany before and after WWI could provide you an example. See here. The short story is that there was a big housing shortage before the WWI, which, after the war, which was no solved by the market, because of rent controls, profits controls, and other regulations. The origin of housing shortage and rising prices:
