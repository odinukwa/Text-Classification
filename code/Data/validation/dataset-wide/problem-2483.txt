Good investigated and good question, Arturia. Forgetting, denying self and effects on it is the reason why bad deeds are done. Maybe even lesser as if holding it high and silly defent it. The solution lies how ever in the right approach. One has to develope the right notion of self and what is protective and harmful for it. The Self is very needed for the whole path, not to speak about pleasant life in the world and it is nessesary to develop a good sense of Self. The Self is one of the governing prinziples. And needed to force one to act skillfyl. Even on high level, a life dedicated only for Nibbana. 

What is ones "act-ual", or real body? It's good to experiment, even look what (kind of regard) is lesser stressful, if certain regard still contains stress, and not so good to assume preoccupations (ideas of phenomenas or the phenomena itself) as "this is real, this is mine, this is my self, this is what I am". Understand, Nyom Kara. Do that much, and no need then to ask if certain phenomena was right and real afterwards. Look and investigate again.

Yes! And out of compassion for all others. An all included wisdom & compassion. ➱ 1th stage of wisdom, serious honesty: 

— AN 10.176 Q: But is this (scared or nervous) a good or bad sign? Is just a Dhamma. Seeing Dhammas arise and decay. Knowing there qualities, holding on, increase developing benefical and giving no further attention, abound unbenefical, is the work not only to reach proper concentration, Jhana, but also to obsereve them (Dhammas) there in there arising and decay more refined and like they actually are. It's a good sign, being aware of it, and for its abounding, it was a good sign, a blessing, to ask abot it: 

Rishi, and those interested - Namo tassa bhagavato arahato sammā-sambuddhassa - Family responsibility is a very high one, a "duty" and in fullfilling it, Buddha had point such deeds having done as one of the highest protection, highest blessings: 

So when one considers this levels of families, their positions in regard in responsibility, one, for oneself more or less still to much bound in lower relations, might nevertheless see that taking on higher regard of relations and responsibilities has to be rightous also regarded as such, and will be, of people who are not totally blind. Yet one him/herself might be not able (better willing to go forward) to leave certain levels and step higher in regard. Nevertheless, higher relations, higher taking on of responsibility, will e regarded as praiseworthy, heros of people with basic right view, not to speak of people of integrity: "going forth/forward, is always praised by the wise!" 

So, right here where this is, there is, at the point of a wordling, no better act of compassion as to strive for right view by practicing generosity, precepts and reflecting the Dhamma and let go of certain ego-trips: 

So another try to find a shortcut of your(s) (defilements)... :-) at least you give others chances to enjoy the effort of doing merits. If even they would see fruits of answering your questions for you, such as success by your's would be great. Well then: read, and pay close attention, Eggman, Atma will write and link. What level of skill permits meditation to release pleasure? How advanced must one be for this effect? See again the answer to similar question of yours: Lack of Pleasure and Joy. To have in the objects of reflection, the devotion for them need to be developed. For having joy in reflecting about ones generosity, moral conduct, virtues like Devas, certain amount of such successful deeds of merits that such is present in one, need be done in faith, in advanced. It's not possible to gain without having given a cause, having sacrified first. Like no corn if field-work has not been done. Dhamma does not work on borrow, taking first. Is focused meditation -- i.e. shamatha -- the only meditation conducive to pleasure? Are there meditations more conducive to pleasure? To gain the pleasure sukkha, reflect again:

First of all Sadhu for the skillful mental action and state of conscious and moral shame. The Buddha, so his disciples, did not taught laypeople much in regard of "best" livelihood, Justme. He focused on the livelihood he chose as most proper and praised like all wise the going forth, as the best means of livelihood. It's properly good, in regard of right view, to "start" with right livelihood for the mind, which is best feeded with right thoughts, intentions and right view. There is at least no food (for pleasure), no livelihood, no entertaining (upadana) that does not require sacrifies and pain at least, if follow the lines in the circle of trade and exchange. So one seeks for the most harmless food to use it for overcoming food. Here with right livelihood. What ever extend one sees such and understands to ste ossible out of that, go for better livelihood, maybe even to the highest right livelihood as "begging" recluse, what ever makes the conscious ligher and one self out of feeling remorse, is good, if not simply hypocritical. There are three ways of actions: bodily, by one self; by speech (all kind of expressions), in ordering or encouraging others; and by mind (in toughts by wishing, agree, acepting, aprove). All three action, if based on mind outwardly as well, have dependent on the quality (skillful, unskillful, neutral) their "equal" results. So most actions, then followed by one adopting in livelihood, can only right considered in ones own sphere and situation. While answering your question general with a categorical yes or now would be wrong and just a view. Best is always to follow ones conscious, where ever it (good considered) might be more lighter and dependent on current possibilities of change, step by step. While one could formal argue "but if doing and not agree with certain outcomes" might be sometimes a possible way, especially if not having ways to chance livelihood and being "somehow a slave", going after a live on two vehicles will lead to painful accidents. There are cases where worker "ungrateful" opposte their leaders/chiefs, the feeding hand: such is very unskillful. But to encourage ones chief or leader, while still bound, to walk better, more virtuose ways, nd act with right intention in all spheres possible for one, could help in a dependig situation. A soldier might be able to seek after work in the kitchen or as ambulance, to give a figural sample. Even if there are no "this, and nothing else is right" grasps are given here, it might contain food for own good investigation for the situation and for sure the best teaching, for all situation, very clear, is given by the Buddha to his son. It's good to follow just this mode, where ever one for now may walk or stand: Instructions to Rahula at Mango Stone [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.]

Take care of your thoughts, speech and acts, to be not later a target of others with same notions, if they are bad and to gain: long-life, beauty (regard), bliss and strange (as an additional outwardly protection for times conditions for ripping are present. Not to speak about gaining wisdom and itjs release, even here and now. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose and other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange] 

So now it's up to your right effort to make the best out of your previous and here rippened good sign. Mudita 

Who is one, are they, who judge such? It, even such often seens notions, remember on approaches or certain Ariya-movement, best reminded in Europe, but actually everywhere and one time by these and then those all over the world, in just different color. Different or handicap, according to the common notion of such uprising intents, have been the first, who first have ben restricted and later even kill for being not "common". What people try to have, take, hold, if not taken ungiven from the owner, is absolutely in their sphere. Also the taking birth of a being, here or there, on own causes. It's good to exclude such from being "to be controlled by others" ethical approaches, not to speak of putting the lable of Buddha-Dhamma on it, justme. Nobody is really interested in "just me" by others, or? A maybe satisfactioning tiny story about "good and bad luck" and daily opinions of villagers. Try to put this stories message as answering your question. That there is no in charge in this world is a fact and it runs always out therrible if people likedesrie to controll birth and death, lose and gain, in frames of their opinions: "Beings are owner of their kamma" and think if others would assume that you have "potencal" to give ground for possible "unlucky situations" and now tell you that you are forbidden to gave "children", fruits of you acts, and cut off even your hands, or close you mouth. Maybe good to educate compassion also in regard of birth. Consider such, this all here, not to think you need to act like told or restricted. Your thoughts, speech and acts will fall back to you, good, neutral or bad. In regard of the from Upasaka Lanka added question, in your question: "Do any Buddhist traditions teach anything in that regard?" "Buddhists" did, do and will do such for interests of "wordily perfection", but the Buddha and his disciples did, do and will not do. Either to intent the makinging Samsara perfect nor to take on ideas to controll it and the means to control of what one is not in charge. Not to speak of harming or deriving, take away something others hold. Just think on current cases in Burma or Sri Lanka, or look on secular Buddhism pages... to face what certain "Buddhist" develop on teachings. On reasons why people are, are born, like this or that, with this or that appearing, is not a matter seen by science, a matter of statistic... but can be found explained in The Shorter Analysis of Action. Even their popular "Buddhist" monks do teach unskillful means for certain justice, teaching the jstification of taking away, existence and there sources: 

Coming from a closed, probably ill-intended and insulting question, or not, but anyway it's root is actually good to investigate: How comes that praising oneself is unskillful but the teacher of it does? There are many places in the teachings, where the Buddha speaks in "glorification" of the "Buddha". 

...was asked: Probably materialism or cosmology would be the therm for such views. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma, not meant for commercial purpose or other kinds of low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange] 

Dmps, and those interested, Upasaka Akila once asked similar question and did that at least with success: here as introducing encouragement (incl. those of the Buddha, in the links of the answer). Kepping the eight percepts, even if not everyday, is for sure one of the clear signs that one is a serious and discerning follower of the Buddha, one with possible success and upwards (not only even) walking. It's not so that it is a matter of "modern" or "earlier" life but timeless a matter of unskillful and skillful lifestyle. In all times there have been people just used to "modern" (e.g. beloved by many) life. Practicing the Dhamma means to give, give up and withdraw (from unskilful deeds and way of life) and the eight precepts help where the defilements would be strong in arguing, like here an now. Like with precets and virtue generally, it requires faith at first place and just following, because the tesults are unknown, can not be seen for now. Best is possible to make it step by step. To start with one precept, add another, make one better, and so on. How ever, it's good and useful to request them also formal from a monk/s or nun/s and to take/ask refuge before. Such does not only provide good sphere for questions but gives also a subtile and powerful drive. In regard of precepts-training generally, this topic might be useful: Obsering the (5) precepts (it work for all similar. Some "technical" explainings, althought my person is no friend of them, since taken from the Vinaya and not from the Suttas, with Commentary additions (good for wise, bad for not so wise), here: Ñanavara Thera's Questions-and-answers concerning the Uposatha. and more infos and links here. Generally suggest: it's good and needed to have, if no Community of monks, or a monk, is near, good friends who do and who are able to help. So to seek for like-minded or better companions would be the main task. Obiviously merely seldom to be found on common places. Just short to you particular questions: 

The proper themes of meditation for beginning and to provide joy: What should one meditate upon as a beginner? To have joy in something, it requires devotional practice: Respect, Confidence and Patient And yes, without joy no headaway, going forth. One needs a "star" or to see good attributs of real stars in one self. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other gains in the world] 

Maybe a challenging questions for the scholars and literary Abhidhamma-fans, with much possibilities for great merits: 

Therefore: Assuming one has to operate in the temporal sphere, but seeks to diminish the karmic implications of action, what are the characteristics of karmaless actions? One who operates, if there is a notion of one who operates, causes kamma and results. The results of "neutral" kamma, depending on the quality of mind, leads to either pleasant, unpleasant or functional results. The chatacteristic of kamma-less actions is, that such are based on realeased mind. Is this distinct from right action? This is distinct of right action yes. Right kamma, neutral kamma, kamma that leads to an end of kamma and such deeds without results, are differnt Dhammas. For more on ending kamma (if that's the questions underlying purpose at least, or answer had lead to this, if not solved yet) one may see further: MN 57; "Kamma and the Ending of Kamma" in The Wings to Awakening Consider also, if thinking to "boddhisatta"-around the compassioned advice of Upasaka Warapol, on the possible root-inclination of the question, here. Hopeless overestimating, while mostly not capable to keep basic precepts, even fear of having no electricity but thinking a strive for a more noble then a noble, is very common, here, and today like all the time. 

Topics and Speech that easy leads astray and goes straight to papanca, as this is here very close and inclined seemingly; involved. [Note: This is a gift of Dhamma and not meant for commercial purpose or other low wordily gains by means of trade and exchange.] 

Lack of Macchariya is reached by entering the stream. So as long difficulty in devotion, gratitude, precepts, e.g. having not really get known the Dhamma by proper attention, no right view yet, it's good to focus on the base. Then it might be possible, like for this generous and devoted man, to take on: fear & animosity are stilled Much joyful effort is wished! Addition, since just coming aware again: There is a "new" book, a gift of Dhamma to give, surely very usefullin this regard: 

Take care and maintain your virtues, all mundane conducts, merits fast get lost. Are the practical, mundane benefits of mindfulness simply not emphasized, and if so, why? Because they are not capable, yet there is good ground to make just business, anyway. It's a matter of marked, that's it.

So there semms to be a conflict also in the Buddhas teaching on this matter. "Pay debt, in ways of grateful acts and at the same time, share and let go of the 'family'?" But actually it isn't, if looking on it deeper. So leaving the blood related family a little in regard, the family meant on primarly level, one migh see that friends, collegs groups of people around ones "livestyle", be it a good, or a bad, are often, from a personal view, in dependency what one individuall sees a benefical and joy-supporting, higher regarded as blood-family. If such a non-blood-related family, father, mother... supports in just ways of sensual pleasures, such higher regard is wrong. The lowest and higherst kind of support can be seen as in:
