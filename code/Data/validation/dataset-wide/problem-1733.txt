You can install a RAID volume utility that will do the mirroring during runtime, but to get there you'll need to copy the entire disk (not only files but the whole disk in raw like with dd command in unix). 

As they are block these connections are not harmful for a DDOS. Logs are only there to let you know who tried to attack you. What is harmful is when the number of half connection opened gets near the limit you specified in your config. What I suggest you is to follow the advice of Zypher and have your firewall to moderate these connections. 

Squid is a good web proxy to learn. It is also what we use at a client business. You could download a program like virtual box and setup a virtual machine to run your proxy on. This would allow you to have a whole separate system to tinker with, take snapshots of and not break your windows server while you are playing with it. This would also let you try it out on an OS besides windows (although there is a windows port of squid as well) Just a thought. 

You can easily map a port in you docker container to host machines port. For example say your host machines ip is , you can make your api in docker machine available in that ip by mapping the api's port to port of the host machine. Now if you are already have something hosted in the host machine, then you can map it to some other port, say . By mapping the docker images port to port on the host, your api will be accessible at , but if you map it to a different port like , your api will be accessible at This can be done using the simple command below: 

I have several WRT54GL routers that I have flashed dd-wrt v24-sp2 onto. The majority of the settings on these routers are identical as they are all performing the same functions. I manage these devices over the WAN link via ssh. I have wrote a script to log into a list of routers via my ssh settings. The script will update each router with a list of nvram settings for example: 

with ? being the USB device. Just think if = "input file" of = "output file" dd will do a dump of the raw data on the device, including the partition tables. for windows this might work XXClone 

Its quite unlikely, unless your instance health is bad for some reason. But similar issues, with bad IOPS has been reported in past. See Check the "read write IO" vs "pending IO in the queue". So if you have 0 IO when there is pending IO in queue you have a problem. See SLA. Check health of an instance + the health of EBS IOPs. You can use cloudwatch for this to some extend. Check this link. 

I am planning to host a website in Amazon Ec2 instant. I got some basics from the docs. But I have few confusions. If am using cloudfront for CDN, do i really need to server files from s3? The site am hosting is build on Drupal. Does it have any performance difference? 

Sadly, I dont know if you are going to have much luck. I had to disable NLA to get our linux thinclients to connect when I was setting this up a year ago as I could not find any support for it in linux Looking on sourceforge for rdesktop I see a feature request for it that is still open and some posts from 2009 with people asking for support. $URL$ 

You should also be able to perform an NVRAM show and record that information for a backup configuration Another option with ddwrt might be SNMP if you are familer with that. I have not tried using it with ddwrt devices, but have heard from others that it is supported. 

As of now EBS is the most reliable option you have on AWS. It's not only better, its also easy to take snapshots and re-attach to another instance. We have very large Ec2 instances which are EBS based that are used by media site and have not had any issue like this. Apart from that Amazon guarantees 99.95% uptime for this service and will give a refund incase it goes down. To answer your questions. 

I don't exactly get what this is, but fairly understand that the user have to hit apache for this. Can there be a better solution? I might be thinking really foolish here, but want to explore the possibilities. 

It seems that the return path for the packets is not known. To be sure you would need to check intermediate routes, I'll get to that in the end. When you ping 10.10.3.50 from the 10.10.2.0/24 host it is forwarded your default gateway (lets assume 10.10.2.1), then itself checks its own routing table and sees the route for 10.10.3.0/24 via 10.10.1.5. A ICMP redirect can normally be ignored since its purpose is only to shorten hops needed and router load. But it is sent because its seems that the next hop is on the same physical net as the request cames from. But what you should check is wheter or not the 10.10.3.0/24 router as a route for the source subnet 10.10.2.0/24. 

I was thinking of writing some logics to my application so that it can write the static page content to s3 or some CDN and serve primarily from there. But am not sure if this is possible. For example is I have site.com/something, its should look for this in the cdn first and if not present serve from the varnish cache or nginx / php-fpm. The idea is to take traffic away from the server. Is this a possible scenario? In drupal I have seen a module that does this. It stores static file cache in disk and serve if its there. Below is a diagram they provide. 

No I checked at the man page of netstat and there is no way of knowing the time of an established connection using netstat. And I don't think it is stored anywhere because connection are so dynamic. 

An apple's airport express can do do the job as well as any other wireless router. You'll need to configure the router in a browser type: 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 and follow what you need to. 

So I would check if your receiving end has any delay to fetch mail or that the server that receives the mail did not put in a long anti-spam check. I would pull out the logs from your mail server at that moment to see what happened wrong. If the header is right you should look at 2015-09-08 03:19 -0600 (your servers local time). 

Offhand I would probably try one of the following commands: apt-get clean apt-get remove netatalk apt-get -f install dpkg --configure --pending 

This link from microsoft gives advice on the size of a pagefile for 64-bit versions of windows. The information provided does not say it is for win2k8 but the same things should apply. This document should help get you started. For what it is worth, on any windows server we setup that is actully going to see a decent amount of use we manually set our pagefile sizes. 

I am running ddwrt v24-sp2 on three WRT54GL routers. These routers all send their syslog information to the same remote server using syslogd The problem is that in the logs the hostname will change between the LAN IP and 127.0.0.1. This makes it hard to tell which device is doing what when I have several events listed as localhost and makes it impossible to script events to happen when certain syslog messages are received. Does anyone know of any way I can differentiate which message comes from which host? Is there some option I did not see to for a tag or extra information into the message. Can I force the host to send its hostname with each message? Here is an example of the syslog output:
