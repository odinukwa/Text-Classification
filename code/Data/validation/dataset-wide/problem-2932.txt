One problem here is that you are acting outside the structure everyone else relies upon to make decisions and create efficiency. The fact this may be an unfortunately corrupt and inefficient mechanism to begin with does not prevent you from making it worse. Even if your intention is good, the odds are that you are encouraging enough institutional waste to offset your net effect. And it may be pointless. After all, it may be perfectly possible to simply get the money given voluntarily by the corporation. PR pays off in spades. I would argue from the Agile principle that lack of transparency ultimately displaces energy from the task at hand into power-mongering. If this is something that happens -- employees simply reallocate funds on purpose to what they prefer -- then money might go missing from any part of the enterprise for no reason at any time. So the company cannot trust its control of where its money goes, and it has to pad allocations to many areas, lest they get stolen from at a bad time, causing delay or missed opportunities. But then that is money that is sitting stagnant in reserve, in case something bad happens. It cannot be stored and leveraged, because its use cannot be planned. And it does not flow out into the economy. So it does not create employment opportunity that might eventually propagate out to create positions for those refugees if they want to establish residence in their new host countries. One of the main reasons companies are larger and more rigid than necessary is to provide ballast meant to forestall risk. By creating unseen and unpredictable risk, you are encouraging them to be larger and for more of the bulk to be waste. 

Saving the lives of one's children at the cost of one's own is not uncommon. So there is a dimension missing from your question. Broadened to include the continuation of one's family and culture or the larger systems of which those are a part as a form of 'indirect selfishness', however, the answer has to be 'no'. From the point of view of Dawkins' theory of selfish genes, we are made by genes for their own selfish purposes. If we were not somewhat selfish, to a degree that we gathered power to ourselves in the service of our genes, they would stop bothering to make us and make something else. This is the second-hand, scientific version of the basic notion of Nietzsche's philosophy. The goal of an organism is to serve its will to power. Fortunately, power takes so many forms that the lives of organisms can be complex, artistic, and fulfilling. 

I would say that the essence of modernity is in the word, which basically just means 'trendy, new and fashionable', but in a sense that does not indicate immaturity. Modernity is accepting the present as being as important or more important than history. A trap that European civilization fell into, since it succeeded a very powerful culture and came back into its own power slowly, was 'Golden Age' thinking, that the truth was clearer earlier in time. Whether we looked back to Jewish scriptures when studying religion, to Plato and Aristotle when studying physics and logic, or to the Pax Romana when studying law, we had the impression that in the Roman Classical period and earlier, thinking was just better, clearer and more useful in various ways. At a certain point, that reversed. We convinced ourselves that the past is not more important, and is certainly not clearer about the truth, than the future is going to be. This began in our Enlightenment period, grew into Logical Positivism and Scientism, and ran its course through the period that consciously called itself Modernism. So we consider the kind of thought most characteristic of what evolved though those periods to be Modern. There is more and more force arising late in the modern period to consider the damage done during this period to culture and the planet, and to feel bad in particular about Colonialism, and thus to turn away from this way of thinking. Thought that self-consciously turns away from this period's products is called post-Modern. In particular post-Modernism challenges the value of 'progress' and tries to handle history more even-handedly, since a long period of Modern thinking has now devalued it as much as it was overvalued before the Enlightenment. 

There is not a contradiction. Formalism is insistence that only the form, and not the content of mathematics is really mathematical. So the content can be motivated by anything from religion to politics to whim. As long as only the result, and not its motivation, really matters to you, the two can coexist. Most formalists still allow themselves to fall back into Platonism for concreteness, knowing that if they wander too far, they will encounter real, basic paradoxes, but not caring, because the effect of these explorations is what matters, and not their content. But I feel there are more productive ways to look at this approach to mathematics than to ignore half of your belief. Much good mathematics is motivated by a faith we share about our interpretation of the world. And formalism demands this be put aside entirely, as it lies outside mathematics proper. I think this psychological/mentalist view of mathematics deserves attention, and that its first genuine form is reflected in Brower's 'intuitionism'. --- To address the comment --- I may be 'really doing' physics. The content may be intrinsically tied to matter and masses, etc. But that, then is not a part of the mathematics involved. From a formalist view the fact that it takes a specific form makes it mathematics (they do not agree absolutely on the relevant aspects of that form). So for abstract reasoning, Platonic religion, or aspects of physics, or the psychological confusion caused by word games can equally be motivation. We can factor out the mathematics from the irrelevant content based upon the form it takes. Despite the statements of the problems they solve, the marriage etable algorithm has nothing to do with romance, and the convergence of the probability of derangments has nothing to do with hats. Euclidean geometry has nothing to do with pictures. Formalism just takes this observation to its logical extreme. Brower (a geometric topologist) rejects this because it rules out the process of geometry to a huge degree. What geometrically-oriented thinkers, including many real analysts and topologists, and even abstract algebraists who focus on diagrams that capture combinatorial forms or depictions via category theory do, mathematically, is largely an aspect of their perceptual apparatus, which they translate into words or diagrams. But the nature of the idealized shapes themselves seem to be germane, and to be inseparable from the mathematics. The content is forced into relevance in order for any interpretation to retain the intended meaning. (He overcorrects by insisting all mathematics is basically non-linguistic, ignoring modern forms, like model theory and all the algebra it encompasses, which are in intention entirely linguistic. But the point is that we should not throw out Classical math, or any other part, not that we should put rigid boundaries around future math.) The compromise then is to say we are studying the mechanism of abstraction itself. We are doing applied psychology, while the formalists are doing applied semantics. Abstract semantics, is, of course, part of linguistics which is a close cousin to psychology, so the two camps largely get along. But we feel that formalism lacks 'a soul' that mathematics used to retain via Platonism. By focussing on the fact this is an exploration of an important aspect of human nature, mathematics gets back a grounded purpose, and the immediacy and passion that it can incite makes some sense. To be genuinely excited by abstract semantics seems anomalous, philosophically. But it is very, very common for real mathematicians to be deeply invested. 

why we assume there is a remainder, whether we can even know of the existence of a remainder, and whether, if we are sure we can't know, it is more logical to just assume there is none. 

In The Great Disruption and in Trust, the conservative political philosopher Francis Fukayama gives an economic interpretation to 'social capital' looking at how liberal economics only works because assumptions based upon traditional principles can be taken for granted. For example, where there is no underlying sense of honor, corruption prevents meritocracy no matter how much economic force arises to encourage it. Without investing real capital to suppress corruption, instead of creating efficiency, the pressure demanding better use of resources instead leads instead to pretense, greater waste, and ultimately failure. As a less traditional example, he indicates the ease with which Americans will simply get into another person's car, and still feel safe, in a way that some Europeans would be scared to do, and many Central Americans would be objectively stupid to do. (It is not that the other American whose car you get into is actually less violent than his European or Central American counterpart, we have more crime that Europe, and less than Central America, to approximately equal degrees, and both of those cultures see this as equally weird. It is particularly American ethical quirk that we extend the expectation that one should be gracious in one's own home, to our automobiles.) This creates an opportunity for an economy of low-oversight taxi service, and ultimately Uber... The fact it creates the opportunity for efficiencies makes this a form of capital, in certain terms. Once it is lost, more genuine economic capital must be invested directly to offset the cultural drag that ethical assumptions used to counteract.
