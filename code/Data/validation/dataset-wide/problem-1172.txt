I've got the following scenario: ( loggend in on SQL-Server with full admin-privileges ) Creating LogIn, User, Role and associate them. 

I've done this a couple of weeks ago - Created , and . Added to and granted explicit permissions to the itself. The advantage in my opinion is, that you can add further users later on without the struggle to grant the permissions, again. First I created the login: 

-- The SELECT permission was denied on the object 'testtable', database 'xyz', schema 'dbo'. -- The UPDATE permission was denied on the object 'testtable', database 'xyz', schema 'dbo'. 

You don't have to add or else, if you explicitly grant permissions to the specific objects. Beware that an for example permission doesn't include the permission on the same object. ( at least in my case it didn't ;) ) If you have problems executing or selecting from your , check if you have granted all permissions on the referenced objects in the itself! Update after Cobus' update in OP: I've executed the queries you provided based on my initial answer, results following: 

I get an error, that no exclusive lock to database to fulfil this operation can be gotten. Since sql-server is part of a virtual-machine, I'm quite sure, that no*one* has any database-access at this time but me. I thing that one ore few processes prevent me altering the collation having access to db, but I can't determine which it could be. I've deactivated all possible services having something in common with the sql-server, but error stays the same. ( Running Processes: MSSMS and Report Server ) I know I have successfully changed collation on another db in the past - easyway - via contextmenu/properties/collation, but this also has no success. Reading several articles of changing collation of each object by one via cursor operation is not what i want to do. Any hints would be appreciated! 

Database is a vital part of any application and is active all the time.This is why databases are often hosted in dedicated servers where nothing else can hamper the resource utilization for the database. Now coming to your question, there is no problem at all and SQL Server is working as expected. SQL Server is smart enough and caches as much as possible to make operations faster. There is a setting called MAX MEMORY SETTING that can be set to a value at which you want SQL Server NOT to use any further RAM. This is done after keeping aside the memory usage for the OS processes. 

I have a request to uninstall one of the test instance which is part of Always ON. I googled around for a clean decommission but did not find steps for Always ON Instance uninstallation. Would be great if Steps can be shared here or any link if you are aware of. As per me I would : 

Since the recent patch where TLS 1.0 was disabled and 1.1, 1.2 Enabled , we are having issues where the SSRS in the server cannot make connections to the Database server. 

Other than Logins,Agent Jobs,Triggers and already mentioned points by Max, these 2 can also be looked upon. 

Can some one suggest some approach where Oracle some how notifies application server when lock expiration time is reached? Edit (To answer questions raised by Gil Shabtai) Its probably my bad that I tried leaving some of the points from the discussion which I thought were irrelevant to the question I was asking. Here are the answers to your issues / questions raised 

I am using Postgres 9.5 I have tables with date column. All tables are partitioned based on the date column. Table setup: Example of current partitioned tables are like below 

After 30 seconds a notification needs to be sent out to all clients that a lock has expired and this employee is available again for updates. Now to identify if LOCK_UNTIL duration has reached, application makes a SQL call to database every 2 seconds to see if 10:00:30AM has reached. Performance Issue: This call every 2 seconds is causing lot of overhead on the database and on the application server. I am looking for a better ways where Oracle itself initiates a notification to the server when lock expiration time has reached. Is there any way I can achieve this? Possible solutions: 

Current Setup: My application uses Java (Spring) and Oracle 11g and has functionality where logical locks are placed on an object before updates are made in the table. For example there are 2 tables EMPLOYEE and EMPLOYEE_LOCK. When any update is made to employee, an entry is inserted into EMPLOYEE_LOCK table to indicate that for next 30 seconds a particular employee is locked. So EMPLOYEE_LOCK table looks like below (as of 10AM) 

Patch the passive node first. Move the resources to the passive node.(This will become active now) Patch the current passive node.(It was originally active). 

This is the most frequently faced issue for almost all the DBAs where the logs grows and fills out the disk. 

Now you need to remove the parameters : @CurrentDatabaseNameFS and UPPER(@CurrentBackupType). This will create all your backups to a single location as below 

I was going through various articles on Missing indices and Unused Indices. Was wondering how having multiple indices which are un-used causes performance issues. 

All you have mentioned should be fine. Just remember to script out the replication before doing this as a backup. 

As per Microsoft, having same service account is the prerequisite : All server instances that host an availability replica for the availability group must use the same SQL Server service account. The domain administrator needs to manually register a Service Principal Name (SPN) with Active Directory on the SQL Server service account for the virtual network name (VNN) of the availability group listener. If the SPN is registered on an account other than the SQL Server service account, authentication will fail. $URL$ 

The above will backup all databases in AG except UserDb. For more information please go through the Databases parameter in the below link Ola hellengren 

I wanted to know if DBMA_REDEFINITON package allows a WHERE clause to filter contents before migration. I have a partitioned table and wants to copy data and constraint to another table using DBMA_REDEFINITON but while copying contents, I do not want to copy a particular partition from the original table. Is it possible to drop this partition using WHERE clause. The question came from following information given on Oracle Tips site 

So for some reason, ORACLE is not taking Index into consideration while running update query on PLAN table. Am I missing something? 

This way application will not insert submitteddate from the code to support Oracle table structure, instead for postgres its a default value which will get added automatically when a row is inserted in each partitioned table. Therefore calculating single date at the beginning of the transaction would be difficult as this will require changes on Oracle side as well to add date column to each table. Is there any other option that is possible? 

The down side of this approach is the time between the execution of drop partition and rebuilding index, those indexes will be unusable that might create performance problems. So my question is, is there any option where I can drop partition and rebuild index "online" in one query? Currently I dont think we have following option. 

Works fine. Needed permissions on objects for created login ( ) are granted in separate queries, not completely neccessary for this question. Now, logging in with this login I have to query which is possible but only returns data for and . I tried several ways to grant explicit permissions to the group ( ), but none of them leaded to the fact, that I can query the complete content of the view. I need to determine, whether some logins exist while logging in with an random account, which is assigned to the prior created role ''. Permissions can and SOHULD be granted to this role, to avoid having to grant them for each new user. What I tried so far: A: 

Same as B D: USE master GO GRANT VIEW DEFINITION ON LOGIN::ocmb_admin TO ocmb_admin Can be executed, if is also created on -db, but does not have any effects on querying. Thanks for hints! 

I've added the CHECK_POLICY param because things are created on user interaction and I'm not able to see, if policies are activated server-sided. Followed by the user: 

-- The INSERT permission was denied on the object 'testtable', database 'xyz', schema 'dbo'. It behaves as intended. Do you have any further permissions granted / set or properties which allow you to access dbo-schema? 

My ordering application uses Oracle 11g Database. This DB has a primary table ORDERS and multiple child tables like ORDER_DETAILS, PLAN etc. ORDERS table is LIST partitioned on STATUS column and all other tables are referenced partitioned with ORDERID as a foreign key. At peak load, when order status is changed and ORDERS table row is moved from one partition to another, Oracle performs row migration for all the child tables referenced partitioned by ORDERS table. Due to many tables that depend on ORDERS table, large number of row movements happen causing a deadlock in one of the child table. My question is, how to resolve a deadlock caused in the ORACLE's internal row migration step? Here is an example setup: ORDERS table: 

One solution could be to use DBMS_SCHEDULER package and create a scheduled job. But I could not find anywhere in the documentation, some way for the job to notify application server. It can send an email but that wont help me much. Second option could be to use "Database Change Notification feature" but this is triggered on a DML or DDL change on the DB object which is not happening in my case. 

There are many more child table where ORDERS is there parent table. Under heavy load, when ORDER status is changed which causes row movement between partition, following deadlock error is printed in the log ORA-00060: deadlock detected while waiting for resource In the Oracle trace log, I see following SQL causing deadlock 

Yes you can do that. Before hand make the log reader job disabled. This will make sure the jobs are not looking for the database. For more clarity look at the below link : MSDN : Replication and Single user Mode 

This is how SQL Server works and there are limitations to make it perform better as the Page limit is 8KB for all versions of sql server. Pasting something from msdn that will be helpful : $URL$ Row-Overflow Data Exceeding 8 KB A table can contain a maximum of 8,060 bytes per row. In SQL Server 2008, this restriction is relaxed for tables that contain varchar, nvarchar, varbinary, sql_variant, or CLR user-defined type columns. The length of each one of these columns must still fall within the limit of 8,000 bytes; however, their combined widths can exceed the 8,060-byte limit. This applies to varchar, nvarchar, varbinary, sql_variant, or CLR user-defined type columns when they are created and modified, and also to when data is updated or inserted. 

Try making the db to Multi-User from the GUI and not via script in query window.Also run sp_who2 and try to terminate the connection which is accessing the database now. Once the database is accessible to all users, it will not throw the error you have mentioned.
