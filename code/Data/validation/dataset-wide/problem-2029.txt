IMO this question is an ice breaker and usually asked in the beginning of the interviews. In replying to this question, I have mostly heard people talk briefly about their education, work/technology experience along with domain (knowledge) demonstration. Achievements and out of work involvement with technology if any (like a certification or an open source project code commit-ter). All of this is sufficient for me when I am conducting interviews for (IT)developer roles and I would think would be sufficient in most interview scenarios. However, if the interviewer needs to know additional details s/he will ask you to give additional details about your family or probably your nocturnal routine. In case if you are from a region where fudging resumes is common place, an astute interviewer might use your answers to cross reference what you say with what you have written in your resume. Of course if you are applying for positions which require security clearance and if it is not just the initial interview rounds, then the interviewer will ask for very detailed answers. 

Create a small setup on my local machine and code a small employee details like project. Document various use cases that could happen in a development environment which may particularly be bothering you in your current environment. Request my manager for a meeting and give him a demo of handling the use cases with version control and the current approach the company has and effectively show how easy life would be if there was some version control in place. 

You didn't mention at which level you are joining your new employer. Also, what does your contract say about such a situation ? 

I am helping someone with their resume. The person is a citizen of country A, has work permit (and will require sponsorship) in country B and is currently a permanent resident of country C and D. When applying for jobs, where and how to show that the candidate is open to relocate to any country (AND will not/require visa sponsorship) ? And more importantly what would be an acceptable resume format to list the authorizations of these many countries. 

I am a customer-facing programmer who is growing in a commercial direction. In the last 34 months I have been very successful at bringing opportunities to the company, often doing the job of the only salesperson I support. I brought millions over the years, directly responsible for several new customers in my territory. I asked to have more formal responsibilities for the territory I cover. My manager is being pressured to hand me over to some other manager. The head of sales wants me to join him as technical support. Both moves will bring more structure and lower decisional power. In other words, without commercial managers I have been doing so great on the commercial side that now commercial managers want to manage me. Meanwhile, the CEO asked me to create a full plan for the territory for next 12 months, putting together all my knowledge of the upcoming opportunities, with detailed estimates. I know I can pull this off, because I know well customers, product and market. However, there is no committment by the CEO or the company to give me a bigger role, and it's possible that even after I do this my work will be handed over to somebody else. Managers argue about giving me a more structured, smaller role; the CEO wants me to complete a major project; in either case, there is no promotion in sight, and I never had one in almost three years. My question is: should I accept a project well above my pay grade from the CEO, without rewards in sight, ignoring all other managers' requests for "surrender"? Is it realistic to expect that a big success with the CEO will override all other crap about my role? Or am I wasting my time? 

I would like to see what opportunities are out there, but most of the companies I could work with are part of my customers or partners portfolio. Can I ask my contacts for opportunities? Is it the norm? Or is it likely that I will be exposed and get in trouble with my current job? If I say "confidential", does it bear any weight? 

First, get to know why there is none already. May be water cooler chat ? Apart from what everyone else has suggested -if you are so passionate about source control, if I were you, I would do this : 

In addition to what Joe Strazzere answered, if you feel so passionately about using your favorite ORM correctly, how about taking a use case and showing your co worker how things can get blown ? And if things are moving smoothly teach the guy how to use the thing. One of the most important things that you can do IMO - You can point out the issues you foresee in code review meetings and propose solutions for it.Obviously if other reviewers don't see the problem, you have to be ready with a use case for problems you see. I know from ORM experience that if you don't do it right, it can be the single most traumatic thing to debug/fix. Right from application response time to corrupt data. As a developer, end of the day, my top most priority is the well being of the application/project am working on writing efficient code that performs at its peak and doesn't break. That is what I am paid to do and that is my top most interest at work. 

That would depend on the law in Singapore. You don't need to submit it if you dont want to. I think you'd want to weigh in a lost opportunity versus sharing of the sacred resignation letter. 

Set deadlines on things that need to be completed.If you are in IT, then have a project plan, create status tickets and assign them to developers in question. If you are not in IT, then either maintain a white board or distribute an excel sheet keeping a track of who was assigned what - what is the current status and if there are impediments if any. Depending on which stage your project is, take a daily/weekly stock check of situations and where you stand. Since you already know your team is slipping out of control, keep senior management involved in where your project currently is and send them daily/weekly/monthly project updates. Always keep them in loop of your project's status. Always keep an open channel of how open issues can be reported back by your team members to you. If the assigned tasks aren't being completed on time you have to take a professional approach and set a yardstick of how you want to deal with these issues. Do you want to issue 2 warnings or 1 warning and put the candidate on a performance improvement plan before reporting this guy to senior management/HR ? Or take a step back and see if you have evaluated this person's capacity on the task assigned correctly and whether another employee could do this better. Your end objective is to make sure the tasks are completed. In this process if you burn some bridges you need to ask yourself what is important ? Is it your relationship with your employees or your commitment/loyalty to work and your discharge of duties for the salary you are paid. 

My question is: how to get rid of managers whose only contribution to project is being in the way, and who manage to get credit without any leadership? Note: in my same company I have many opposite examples of leaders who manage AND contribute positively to projects, making sure that experts' work is recognised. I am trying to understand if there's a cure for TIM. 

What is the difference between a Business Development Manager and a Salesperson? I am interested in understanding how these two roles differ on a day-to-day basis, and how they interact with each other. EDIT: my basic knowledge would separate the two roles between "generating new leads" and "closing deals, managing current accounts". But I am trying to understand if this is correct, and how the roles interact. 

I recently moved up from a specific team to a global function, moving from an incompetent manager to a very good one. I am in a healthy and productive environment. However, yesterday my own job description came up in the company's careers page. Apparently shortly after the move my old manager and her 'collaborators' made arrangements to hire my replacement to work with them directly. So, now we have a global function, which is providing strategies, procedures and standards for the whole company, and these guys' upcoming resource, which will... I don't know. They are basically internalising my global support role. I have no idea about how to sort this mess: my boss is protective, but he also didn't tell me about this for weeks. He already has trouble trying to keep together his team now that they are hiring a 'parallel' role. In the best case, we are having a situation where two people who should be working together work separately; in the worst case, the decrease in my workload might support my departure. Edit: upper management is fighting about internalising a global function, which would be my role. My boss is supportive, but the other side is hiring somebody with exactly my same job description. I am trying to understand if there is anything I can do in such a mess, as I would like to keep my role. 

I have never heard of such coding restrictions. So much so that I was close to marking this as an unreal question. However, there is a possibility this is indeed the case. Have you made an attempt to understand fully why these restrictions were imposed ? If you think these restrictions are whimsical if I were you, I'd first initiate the talk with my PM. In your case since you have the go from your PM, if the offshore resource is not a sociable person, then write a mail to the PM, this sr. resource and the project lead/designer/architect with a few bullet points explaining why you think the core design of the project is amiss. Identify potential causes for system failure and figure out the anti patterns. I would take a simple module and with the help of use cases show how/when the module will break. I would then compare it to my rewritten solution of the same module that would be built using some commonly followed design principles or in your case what you think is missing. Also highlight the time saved in coding, maintaining and scaling future requests. The offshore resource may be the key person, but don't you have documentation around what is being done ? If the project manager wasn't prepared for his senior programmer to be hit by a bus, I think you will just have to assume he was and propose your solutions. 

It is indeed alright to leave out snail main address(es) from resumes. In most scenarios the recruiters will ask for a current address from the qualifying candidate, which is then used to either mail in an offer letter or just update HR records. A lot of candidates give just a PO Box no. which is perfectly fine. One has to remember that resumes these days are no longer local. A lot of international candidates will mention at least one 'permanent address' on their resumes. If an employer is participating in E-Verify, or requires clearance for candidates on work permits, they may be required to gather a candidates mailing address and cross check with the latest AR-11 form the candidate filed. This is of course a situational/circumstantial thing. Although one is not required by (US) law to live at an address (so no employer can deny employ-ability for the lack of an address) it could raise an eyebrow. Nevertheless, a commonly followed trend is to at least provide a PO Box no. 

In both cases my work is delayed in exchange for almost no contribution, and my own boss is already aligning this project with the company's interests. My question is: how can I defend myself from all these self-invited contributors, in a professional way which will protect my best interests without damaging my career? 

some customer requires a new project. TIM has no idea about the requirements, the feasibility or the scope of the project because of experience and background. TIM goes to one expert, who has a deep knowledge of the technology required and is able to design and see the project to completion. When the expert says "what is the project about?" TIM will systematically reply: "you are the expert, you have to tell me!" or "there is only you, you have to make this happen!". At this point the expert has two alternatives: A) accept the project, making all the work, or B) keep focusing on his current workload and push the project back declaring it as unfeasible. In case A), the expert will start talking directly to the customer and do all the work, keeping TIM informed until the project is completed. During this process TIM will provide no practical contribution other than anecdotes from LinkedIn articles. In case B) the expert will keep doing his job, but the manager will badmouth the expert as "not being a team player" and going against the best interests of the company. In case A), TIM will add a complete project to his portfolio AND he will go around saying that he successfully managed a highly qualified team for a very ambitious project. TIM gets a big bonus, the expert maybe gets some peanuts if TIM feels magnanimous. In case B), the expert will be seen negatively by the higher management, because those guys also have no technical background and can't evaluate adequately the value of the rest of the things the expert did beyond this refused project. 

I work in a Biotech company and my current manager has no scientific strengths. He is focusing on managing projects, but that's it. Recently senior management decided that my work is important for the whole company, and I start reporting to a VP. Later on there will be a unit with other specialists under the VP, but right now I am going to be co-managed for a while. However, my current manager is already politically compromised and is trying to use my expertise to survive. He already got demoted shortly after starting. He keeps asking me for details and then repeats them at meeting to people who know even less than him. My senior colleagues keep asking me to interact more directly with them, but my manager keeps trying to put himself in the middle to intercept communications and requests even if he does not have the competence to understand what a specific project would imply. The VP has a technical background and understands me. I am happy that change is coming, but I can't wait to get rid of this parasite and at the same time I don't want to be the one who badmouthed his manager or got him fired. But I feel dirty when I talk to him, I feel more stupid every minute. My question is: how can I handle the transition between my manager to the VP, keeping professional integrity and a good face while avoiding getting credit stolen by my manager?
