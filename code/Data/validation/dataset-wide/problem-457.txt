Just to expand on @Batman's excellent answer... Rims properly designed for rim brakes will have sufficient thickness of material to withstand wear from the pads. It's not uncommon for track/street rims to be 'unmachined' like yours. Most of the time the downside will simply be dirt / paint wear as you have experienced, but bear in mind that many deep rims aimed at the fixed gear market may well assume brakeless riding, and running rim brakes may compromise their safety before too long. 

Seeing as you've removed the nut, you could try to insert a punch through the mounting hole, and gently tap it a few times to try and free it. I reckon there's dirt, mud, and perhaps rust in there that's causing it to stick. A picture would be useful if something else is amiss, but it's hard to imagine anything else. 

Aesthetically, it's just a case of keeping it clean. Use a toothbrush to clear accumulated dirt out of the little nooks and crannies, like the joints between tubes (especially around the bottom bracket). Waxing the frame can help keep that brand-new lustre. The back of the chainring and spider, sprockets, rear hub, and dropouts, can get grotty pretty quickly, so use a gentle degreaser to keep on top of it. Same for the chain. Use a brush to get all the little bits of road dirt out of the links, then, with a clean brush, apply oil liberally. Brush it right in there. Wipe off any excess afterwards. As far as the feeling of mechanical "newness" goes, a clean, well-oiled drivetrain is the biggest contributor IMO. Edit: Bike cleanliness pr0n 

As long as your front derailleur matches the number of gears on your front chain ring (2 or 3) you should be okay. That being said, you may run into issues with different manufacturers or groupsets working well together. Are you using the same make / manufacturer in the front and rear? (e.g., I know Shimano makes both a 9 and 10 speed version of the 105 groupset and I am fairly sure the front derailleur is the same). 

They're heavier, hotter (vents would do the opposite of what you're trying to do with an aero helmet, which is to route air up and over the helmet), and it's more difficult to turn your head (it doesn't completely prohibit turning your head but you lose the benefit of the shape as you turn it off-axis) so you have to depend on peripheral vision more. Plus, if you wear one on a bike path while towing a kiddie stroller federal law requires all other riders (including small children riding Huffys) to treat you with "derision and scorn". 

Not really an answer, but I put it here to separate it from the comments about using a decent track pump... Daniel R Hicks makes a good point about the cracks - they seem to be between the tread and sidewall. This suggests to me that there are two different rubber compounds that aren't "mating" well. According to a few mechanics I know, Schwalbe have had some quality control problems in the last year. I can second this - the relatively recent Ultremo racing tyre range have had some decidedly dodgy sidewalls, and I've had one which separated from the main tread strip within weeks. However, other sets seem fine and are some of the most comfortable, grippy tyres I've ever ridden, and they're lasting. Unless you've kept your tyres in direct sunlight all year, I'd suggest it's a rubber/adhesive issue. Try contacting Schwalbe and see if this is a warranty issue... after all, Marathons are made for milage and aren't cheap! 

You might also want to consider a used bike - you'll be able to get more for your money and if / when stuff wears out you can upgrade it as you go. 

Dumb question - I'm assuming you lined it up with the old one and got a rough length before you put it on? Yes, width is usually the major issue when doing the 6 -> 7 -> 8 etc. move, but it could be that it's too short (pulling the rear derailleur up too high) or too long (they will often include a couple of extra links in these chains). I usually lay the new one out next to the old one and make sure that the length is approximate (the old chain will, of course, have stretched from use to you want to keep that in mind). If I'm feeling particularly anal retentive I'll count the links out (which is, I believe, the recommended method). 

It might seem like a ballache, but you'll thank yourself in a year's time when you want to take something off to clean or change it! Right, onto brakes... 

From the pictures you've posted across a few different questions, I can almost guarantee you will not make money selling that bike, no matter what you do to it. At the very least you will need a new freewheel and chain, new tyres, cables, and brake pads. Sadly, those will probably set you back more than you could sell the bike for. Given your apparent lack of mechanical know-how, you really should leave the repairs to a professional mechanic, which will further add to the costs. I believe you underestimate the differences between your "junkie" bike and modern "fancy" bikes. Yes, you can buy the componentry found on "fancy" bikes separately, but most of it will be designed to fit modern frames, which more than likely have different diameter tubing. Although you should be able to find new parts to replace the knackered ones, they are unlikely to be of high quality. Whatever you do to that bike, it will still be heavy and cumbersome. One can't polish a turd, as they say. Modern, more expensive frames and components are generally lighter, stiffer, smoother, better-fitting, and better-looking... none of which are essential for getting around. If you don't have much of a budget, the best thing would be to find a local bike co-op and learn how to perform basic maintenance from volunteer mechanics. Otherwise, I'd donate that bike to such a project, and buy something a bit nicer second-hand. Or just get your LBS to do the bare minimum to make it rideable, ride it til it falls apart, then get a new one! 

a) Is the headset tight? Over time that can loosen up and it'll start to lean in one direction or the other (usually based on which side of the pothole you just hit). b) Are your wheels true? this probably won't make a major difference but it might combine with the previous point. c) Is the weight on the bicycle evenly distributed? E.g., do you wear a messenger bag across your left shoulder so the weight of the load pulls the bike in that direction? d) Does this happen in a parking lot as well as on the road? Don't forget that streets aren't flat - they curve off to the edges to allow water to shed from the roadway (and into nice deep puddles for motorists to drive through and splash cyclists). If it only happens on the road (and you always ride on the right hand side of the road) it's probably because of Gra-vi-ty. 

If you're willing to accept 5 gears, it's really not that difficult. The main issue is finding a hub that's narrow enough to fit the dropouts. Sturmey Archer make a wide-range 5-speed geared hub, with or without coaster brake, with 120mm OLD spacing. There used to be a 5-speed SRAM hub with 122mm (?) OLD, but it might be a job to track one down. If it's a steel frame with thin stays, you have a couple more mm of leeway. But most hub gears are 135mm OLD. Depending on the hub, it may be possible to remove axle spacers, but don't bet on it... anti-rotation washers don't count; they mustn't be removed! Unless your current frame is a conversion, you may have a few cable-routing headaches too (although clamp-on cable guides aren't difficult to find). It only really makes sense if you love the frame. Part exchange would probably be your best bet, but if you have a good reason to keep the bike then I say go for it. My partner is very short (5'), and standover height is an issue, so she rides a kids' Fuji track. The cost of the Fuji, plus that of building a new wheel around the SA hub, was significantly lower than any WSD we could find. Afterthought: A cheap and good way (albeit one that requires some tinkering, swearing, and an awful lot of luck): 5-speeds from the 50s tended to be 120mm OLD, so you might be able to swap out the SS freewheel for an old-fashioned thread-on 5-speed model. There are quite a few caveats, however. For starters you'll need a fairly narrow hub shell. Then you'll need enough free threads on the axle to shuffle the cones and locknuts off to one side, so there's enough axle showing to fit the wheel securely. Then you'll need to re-dish the wheel. Then you'll just need a rear mech with a bolt-on hanger claw (assuming the frame doesn't have a threaded hanger on the dropout). If you're friendly with a local bike shop / junkyard, you might be able to blag these bits and pieces for free. 

You're aware of the fact that as long as you know what the thread pitch on the bolt is that you can just buy one with a hex / philips / security / whatever head, right? Pull the bolt (try and remember where all the various springs, washers, etc. landed when you pulled the bolt out) and take it down to your local Fastenal / OSSCO bolt / whatever and just get a replacement with whatever head strikes your fancy (if it's pan head or flat head you may have some issues getting a hex head bolt to fit because of the inside taper). Or, if you have a thread pitch gauge, you could open your McMaster-Carr catalog and order it from them. Of course, without knowing the exact alloy the bolts are made of you're probably voiding any manufacturer's warranty by replacing a functional section of the brakes. But, hey - if your brakes fail you could always just ram into a tree head first, right? That'll stop you. I, too, am curious as to why you're adverse to an allen head - the hex shape creates a better (more points of contact) grip and it's a standard tool. They're easy to toss into your saddle pouch or pocket of a bike jersy, too. And it's a lot easier to torque them down to a manufacturer's specification than a philips head is. 

As far as I have been able to tell, there is no difference in terms of functionality or practicality. With many bicycle components, different manufacturers create their own standards purely to ensnare customers. All of the vintage brake levers I have seen use pear nipples, so I assume the barrel nipple came later, but I have no idea which manufacturer first designed a barrel-style lever. Personally I just find it an unnecessary annoyance... you can't really say one is used for road bikes and the other for MTBs... the bar end levers on my road bikes take "MTB"-style barrel nipples. Plus I have an older MTB with V-brakes that's fitted with crosstop levers - those take pear nipples. It's just a chore having to double-check before you go and buy new cables. Both kinds are trivial to install, and work just as well as each other once on the bike. Although one style may be more prone to mechanical failure than the other, I am sure that the points of failure for both are far beyond the serviceable life of the cable (i.e. it will have stretched, frayed, and rusted considerably by the time the nipple breaks off). Thankfully I've never seen a third kind. 

I swapped out both tubes on my mountain bike with Presta (less chance of crap getting in to the valve and it means I can carry the same CO2 inflator as I do on my road bike) and got the bushings - once they were in I've had zero issues with the valve stem. I'd definitely recommend putting one in since there's the chance that the valve stem could rub against the edge of the hole or the tube could even prolapse through the hole. I have two of the Presta to Schrader adapters, mostly in case my CO2 inflator dies and I need to try and fill from a gas station (it happened once and I didn't have 'em). Just walk into your favorite B&M store and they'll probably have 'em in a container on the counter. I think I paid just over a dollar apiece. If you're really concerned about losing it you can screw it onto the Presta valve and leave it there; just make sure the valve is screwed shut before you thread the adapter on.
