From a more positive perspective, you are looking at rings with the property that every regular element is a unit. I have done some work with these rings. If the ring is commutative, the condition is equivalent to the ring being a quoring, i.e., it's its own classical ring of quotients. Non-commutative rings with the property must be quorings, but the converse is not necessarily true, as seen with von Neumann regular rings. I called rings with every regular element a unit Dedekind finite because they are characterized as R-modules by the property that every monic endomorphism is an isomorphism (the Dedekind definition of finite set; I picked up the name from L. N. Stout). This is not standard terminology I believe (see Lam's book "Lectures on Modules and Rings). 

I'll follow up on what Karl said with an example closer to my own experience. Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the ring of integers and $p$ a positive prime. Then $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is injective as a $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ - module, being a vector space over a field, whence $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ is its own injective envelope (hull) as a $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ module. However, the injective envelope of $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ as an abelian group is $\mathbb{Z}(p^{\infty})$, which gives witness to Karl's statement that the injective envelope over $A$ can be much larger than the injective envelope over $A/\mathrm{ann}(M)$. You can play this game with $A$ any commutative Noetherian ring with 1, ann($M$) = any maximal ideal of $R$, and $M = A/I$ where $I$ is the chosen maximal ideal. Karl's example presents very limited choice for $I$ since $k[[x]]$is local. I think Proposition 2.27 and Lemma 4.24 of "Injective Modules" by Sharpe and Vamos present enough to figure out what is going on in the general case. 

From time to time, people announce papers claiming to have settled long open problems like $P$ vs. $NP$. There have been many attempts, reading them is time-consuming, and finding bugs in their arguments is not easy, ... . This brings up the following question: 

Note that there are different ways of thinking about set theory and more generally about Logic. They can be thought as a foundation for mathematics or they can be thought as a part of mathematics. If you are thinking of them as a foundation, at the end you have to accept some intuitive concepts, the point of foundation is not that it does not assume anything and builds on nothing, the point is that it is based on accepted theories. Almost all of mathematicians accept the very weak theories about natural numbers and they are sufficient for building the needed metamathematics for set theory. (Primitive Recursive Arithmetic would suffice but even weaker theories are sufficient). I would suggest the introduction of K. Kunen's "Set Theory" book (the part he discusses the formalist viewpoint) and S.C. Kleene's "Metamathematics". 

There is an oracle $A$ s.t. $\mathsf{P}^A = \mathsf{NP}^A$. The oracle normally used for the theorem is the set TQBF which is a $\mathsf{PSpace\text{-}complete}$ set. $\mathsf{PSpace} \subseteq \mathsf{P}^\mathsf{TQBF} \subseteq \mathsf{NP}^\mathsf{TQBF} \subseteq \mathsf{PSpace}^\mathsf{TQBF} \subseteq \mathsf{PSpace}$ All inclusions are clear, the last one follows from the fact that TQBF is in $\mathsf{PSpace}$ and you can replace the oracle for TQBF with the $\mathsf{PSpace}$ machine solving it and the resulting machine will be in $\mathsf{PSpace}$. 

The intuition I have is that relations definable by polynomials is complicated enough that projections can give rise to very complicated sets. The essential point here is not exponential growth, that comes from the unboundedness of the quantifiers, the essential point is that the graph of a very fast growing function can be represented by a polynomial. On the other hand, if the question is about how polynomial equations can represent graphs of complicated function, then I guess the best explanation is by the people who came up with the idea of how to use these equations to represent the graph of a fast growing function, which can find in My Collaboration with JULIA ROBINSON by Yuri MATIYASEVICH (skip to the line numbered (6) in the text) or in his book. 

The finite intersection property: If $C_\alpha$ (for $\alpha\in I$) are closed subsets in a compact space, and every finite intersection of $C_\alpha$-s is nonempty, then the whole intersection $\bigcap_{\alpha\in I}C_\alpha$ is nonempty. Proof. Otherwise, the complement $\bigcup_{\alpha\in I}C_\alpha^c$ is an open cover of the space without a finite subcover. You may prefer the version with the $C_\alpha$-s compact and no assumption on the space containing them, but this is the same since we can intersect all $C_\alpha$-s with some fixed $C_{\alpha_0}$. To me, it is surprising that this trivial proof gives such a useful assertion. One may argue that this boils down to De Morgan's Laws, which are also trivial but very useful! 

Simple simultaneous generalizations of Ramsey's and van der Waerden's Theorem are available. The first was found by Bergelson and Hindman in their only paper published in Combinatorica. The second, which is similar but incompatible and perhaps cleaner, is available in my paper with Samet, Corollary 3.15. Say that a set of natural numbers is AP if it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. This corollary asserts that the Baumgartner-Taylor partition relation holds for AP sets: $$ \mathrm{AP}\longrightarrow \lceil \mathrm{AP}\rceil^k_n $$ for all $k$ and $n$. For $n=2$, this corollary asserts the following: For each AP set $A$ and each finite edge-coloring of the complete graph with set of vertices $A$, there is an AP set $M$ of vertices and a partition of $M$ into finite sets such that all edges among distinct pieces of this partition are of the same color. Using the compactness theorem, one may obtain a finite version of this theorem. 

Springer printed an Errata supposedly to be included in a study edition of the text to be published in 1977. I purchased the original edition directly from Springer and they mailed me the Errata at a later date. I don't really know what transpired in the intervening years. 

We're all approaching this from the perspective that the correct thing for your friend is to stay in mathematics. Perhaps not. I think of three very talented friends who eventually left mathematics. One left to become a successful orthodontist, another actually got his Ph.D., but decided to become a doctor instead. The third sold all his worldly possessions and took up with the Worker's Party. I have two children in theatre, and I remember the advice they received from faculty at the schools they were considering:"You've got to want this more than anything else." I don 't think mathematics is much different. Once the desire is gone, one can try to get it back, or consider if it might be time to move on. As a mathematician, I hope your friend finds some way to get back in the groove. Time will tell. 

I have a Banach space $B$ and a continuous linear transformation $F:B \rightarrow B\times B$. One of the induced transformations $F(1):B \rightarrow B$ and $F(2):B \rightarrow B$ into the factors of the product has closed range. Must F have closed range? I have the max norm on the product, i.e., $\|F(x) \| = max\{\|F(1)(x)\|, \|F(2)(x)\|\}$ for $x$ in $B$. I was hoping to use the minimum moduli of the $F(i)$ to provide an affirmative answer. 

Jech-Prikry: Assume that $2^{\aleph_0}$ is regular and smaller than $2^{\aleph_1}$. If $f(\aleph_1)=2^{\aleph_0}$, then there is an inner model with a measurable cardinal. If $\kappa^{\aleph_0}=\kappa$, then $f(\kappa)=2^\kappa$ (see Hathaway). 

This question assumes familiarity with combinatorial cardinal characteristics of the continuum. Identify an infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ with its increasing enumeration. Thus, for each natural number $n$, $a(n)$ is the $n$-th element of $a$ in increasing order. This way, every infinite set of a natural number is a member of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$. For $f,g\in\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$, write $f\le^{\infty}g$ if $f(n)\le g(n)$ for infinitely many $n$. That is, if $g\not<^* f$. For an infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$, let $a^{c}$ be its (infinite) complement in $\mathbb{N}$. Thus, $a$ and $a^{c}$ are both in $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$, and the following notion is natural. A set $Y\subseteq\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is bi-nondominating if there is an infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ such that $Y\le^{\infty}a,a^{c}$. That is, for each $f\in Y$ we have that $f\le^{\infty}a$ and $f\le^{\infty}a^{c}$. Definition. $\mathfrak{bidi}$ is the minimal cardinality of a set $Y\subseteq\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ that is not bi-nondominating. That is, such that for each infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$, there is $f\in Y$ such that $a\le^{*}f$ or $a^{c}\le^{*}f$. It follows immediately that $\mathfrak{b}\le\mathfrak{bidi}\le\mathfrak{d}$. It can be shown that if we close the sequences in $Y$ under left shifts, then a witness for $Y$ being bi-nondominating actually reaps $Y$. Thus, $\mathfrak{bidi}\le\mathfrak{r}$, the reaping (or unsplitting) number. Since bounded sets in the Baire space $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ are meager, and the operator $a\mapsto a^{c}$ is a hoemomorphism from the Cantor space $P(\mathbb{N})$ onto itself, we also have that the covering number for meager (or Baire first category) sets, $\mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M})$, is not greater than $\mathfrak{bidi}$. In summary, we have: $$ \max\left\{ \mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M}),\mathfrak{b}\right\} \le\mathfrak{bidi}\le\min\left\{ \mathfrak{r},\mathfrak{d}\right\} . $$ Questions. 1. Is $\mathfrak{bidi}$ a new combinatorial cardinal characteristic of the continuum? 

I have been trying to understand what is exactly a sieve and why sieves are useful. I have read Wikipedia articles about sieve theory but they don't provide a definition of what is a sieve or why they are useful. Can someone explain what is a sieve in general terms and what properties of sieves make them so useful in attacking number theoretic problems? Are there general principles that one can use as a guideline to see if sieves are likely to be useful in attacking a problem? I know this question might be a bit elementary for number theorists, but I wasn't able to find good and concise information at the level of a general mathematician. (The Wikipedia article links to Ben Green's notes about sieve theory but the link is not working anymore. I Googled a bit however I couldn't find a concise high-level but rigorous exposition, notes like this and this dive quickly into examples and applications without giving any general definition and discussion of sieves.) 

EDIT: This question has been modified to make it a stand-alone question. Feel free to retract your votes for the previous version. Here are Vinay Deolalikar's paper, and Richard Lipton's first post about it, and the wiki page on polymath site summarizing the discussions about it. His approach is based on descriptive complexity. One of famous barriers for separating $NP$ from $P$ is Razborov-Rudich Natural Proofs barrier. Richard Lipton remarked about his paper and the natural proofs barrier that apparently "it exploits a uniform characterization of P that may not extend to give lower bounds against circuits". A question which is mentioned in one of the comments on Lipton's post is: 

I did not conduct an extensive literature search. I would appreciate your pointing out relevant results that are not mentioned here. Question: Are there additional cardinals $\kappa$ for which $f(\kappa)$ can be evaluated in ZFC? (The question also applies to large cadrinals. I do not request that the cardinals provably exist.) Update. Intially, I also asked whether $\kappa^{\aleph_0}=\kappa$ could be weakened to ${\rm cof}([\kappa]^{\aleph_0},\subseteq)=\kappa$. Todd Eisworth reminds in the comments below that the latter hypothesis is true in ZFC for $\aleph_1$. Strangely, I couldn't find an explicit reference for the following. Question. Is it consistent (modulo suitable large cardinals) that $f(\aleph_1)<2^{\aleph_1}$? Assuming that (See Assaf Rinot's comment below), is there an explicit reference for that? Motivation: The values $f(\kappa)$ pop up whenever I study (usually, jointly with colleagues) the character and other cardinal invariants of topological groups. They are unavoidable. (Comment: By no means do I mean that the symbol $f(\kappa)$ should be reserved for the function thus defined. This is just a short, temporary name for brevity.) 

Item 1 follows from the topological interpretation, but can also be proved combinatorially. Blass supplied me with one such proof. This is a cute exercise (or see below). Items 2-3 are immediate. Item 3 was pointed out to me by Blass. Problem. Can the cardinal number $\mathfrak{ufo}$ be identified as a classic combinatorial cardinal characteristic of the continuum? (For me, $\aleph_1$ is definitely a (potential) positive answer.) Here is Blass's proof. I thank him for the permission to include it here. I made tiny changes. If you find errors, this must be my fault. :) Suppose, toward a contradiction, that some ultrafilter $U$ is the union of a countable, strictly increasing sequence of filters $F_n$. For each $n$, pick a set $A_n\in F_{n+1}\setminus F_n$. By intersecting each $A_n$ with all the earlier $A_m$'s, we may assume that the $A_n$ sequence is decreasing (with respect to set-inclusion). Let $D_n$ be the set-difference $A_n\setminus A_{n+1}$; so the sets $D_n$ are pairwise disjoint. Let $X$ be the union of the sets $D_n$ for the even $n$, and let Y be the union the remaining sets $D_n$. Then $$ \mathbb{N}=X\cup Y\cup (\mathbb{N}\setminus A_1)\cup \bigcap_n A_n. $$ The last of these isn't in $U$, because, being a subset of $A_n$, it can't be in $F_n$ for any $n$. And $\mathbb{N}\setminus A_1$ isn't in $U$, because $A_1$ is. So either $X$ or $Y$ is in $U$; without loss of generality, suppose $X$ is in $U$. Then $X$ is in $F_n$ for some $n$, and we may assume that $n$ is odd (just add 1 to $n$ if necessary). So $F_n$ contains $X$ and $A_n$ but not $A_{n+1}$. But $An\setminus A_{n+1}=D_n$ is disjoint from $X$ (because $n$ is odd), which means that $A_{n+1}$ is a superset of the intersection of $X$ and $A_n$. The preceding two sentences contradict the fact that $F_n$ is a filter. 

This is not an answer to the question intended by OP, but rather a philosophical meta-answer and might be interesting to some readers. The use of sign $\vdash$ is completely different from $\rightarrow$. You can not prove "$\varphi \vdash \psi$", since it is not a proposition. It is a speech-act, it is invented by Frege and has been discussed extensively in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of language. This speech-act is called assertion and is composed of two separate parts "|" and "-". It is an act of judgment. For more details see this SEP article. This distinction between a proposition and a judgment is very important and essential for Martin-Lof's type theory and philosophy. In fact, from this viewpoint, $\varphi \vdash \psi$ is a common formal misuse because the assumptions cannot be before the speech-act. For this reason Martin-Lof prefers to write the assumptions of the assertion after the proposition in his type theories. For difference between $\vdash$ and $\rightarrow$ see this article. 

Provably total functions of an arithmetical theory is one of the tools used in proof theoretic analysis of theories. I am looking for early history of its development. In particular, 

It is an open problem if there is an optimal propositional proof system. Therefore we don't know if ZFC as a propositional proof system is optimal either. ZFC as propositional proof system can p-simulate any propositional proof system whose soundness (if there is proof for a formula then the formula is true) as a propositional proof system is provable in ZFC. The trick (which I think is due to Steve Cook) is based on the fact that proofs are concrete finite objects, if there is a proof for a formula in a proof system, then ZFC can prove its existence (i.e. ZFC is $\Sigma_1$-complete), combining this with the provability of the soundness we derive the truth of the encoded formula in ZFC. The rest of the argument is translating this first order proof in ZFC to a propositional proof in ZFC as propositional proof system and proving the equivalence of a propositional formula with the formula itself in the proof system. This can be done in $\mathsf{TC^0}$-Frege and any system that contains it. See Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity, 2010 by Cook and Nguyen for the details.
