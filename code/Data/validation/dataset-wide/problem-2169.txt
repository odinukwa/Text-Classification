It depends on the culture. And honestly it might not be a solvable issue. In some cases, face-to-face meetings solve the issue. Perhaps face-to-face meetings with e-mail followup. But perhaps also 100% nothing can help. I have consulted at gigs where the scenario is a week-to-week overlapped with a month-to-month version of the film Groundhog’s Day. Just an endless cycle of the same issues, same crisis, same solutions, same agreements… That then get lost in some time-warp I was not made aware of and then guess what? Same issues, same crisis, same solutions, same agreements… The reality is in work situations like this—and heck even life situations like this—you need to step back rationally & see following: 

My attitude is simple: It depends on the job, your desire to let others know about it and your comfort level/assurance you have a future at a job. In my personal experience, I have only updated LinkedIn and Facebook info at least 1-2 months after I have left a position and started a new one; sometimes even 3 months after. Why? Simple: Sometimes your desire to leave a company might result in the company coming back at you a few weeks later asking you to stay onboard. Or a new position might seem fine at first, but after a few months you want out; do you want that odd “less than a year” blip on your job history? So if you are unsure about this, then you should follow the standard concept/timeframe of an employment probation period. In many countries you might start a job on one date, but only after 3 months will you be qualified for benefits and other “perks” of the job. This probation period is often done as a way of admitting, “You know what? Why should we spend time and resources ramping someone into a pension plan if they might leave in 1-2 months for something else?” So the 3 month probation period can be seen as a buffer between what your job expectations are versus what the reality is. And with that in mind, maybe it would be best to only update your social media details after that 3 month point has been reached? 

My university offers a work-study program where full-time students can work jobs within the university which require around 12-15 hours weekly. The semesters are Fall (Sept - Dec), Winter (Jan - April) and Summer (May - August). The work-study program for Fall/Winter is till Feb 23rd as it says on the website and on my contract. I got really busy during Mid January to Feb 23rd so I didn't put in any shifts. My supervisor emailed me near Feb 23rd saying I should be picking up shifts. I apologized and picked up a shift and then it was Feb 23rd. I figured my work study was over (My course load is very high this semester and through the summer so I purposely looked for a job which ends this semester). I got an email on March 21st from supervisor saying that I need to pick up more shifts and that I went missing again. I'm loaded with school assignments and got too busy to reply and I thought my work study was over. I then got another email yesterday from another coworker asking if I can work this week and that I should be picking up as many shifts possible to make it easy for the rest of the workers and supervisors too. How do I tell them that I want to end my contract and no longer want to work without looking incompetent and burning bridges? I understand my employers point of view now (it's hard for them to train students to simply work part time just for a couple months, and all the other students who were employed with me are still working). Overall through fall and winter I didn't work many hours at all so I can see why the employer would be upset. 

This is not bad. A 6 month gap can just mean you took time off to do anything other than work. Which is acceptable. Do you have a hobby? Tell them you took 6 months off to pursue personal things like a hobby. But adding to your resume that you worked at one place for 4 months then quit & then went onto another place where you didn’t even make it past the 3 month probation will not help you out at all ever. I would just leave the gap & not even mention the 2 gigs that did not work out. Anything where you indicate you lasted less than a year at two gigs will never look good under any circumstance. Also a postscript, but basically you might want to also step back to under stand why you quit one job after 4 months & then shifted into another job where you took on a new role yet are being terminated after 2 months. Learn from both of these experiences so your next gig is one you can thrive in. 

Suppose I am being interviewed and during the end of the interview, the people interviewing me ask me if I have any questions for them. At this point, should I only ask "deal breaker" questions (questions whose answers play a huge role in me accepting the job or not)? Or is it recommended that I ask questions just out of curiosity as well (questions whose answers wouldn't effect my decision on whether or not I want the job and whose answers I will find out within the first week or so of work anyways)? Examples of deal break questions for me would be: What salary range should I expect? When should I expect a response by? Is this a company where the workers work and see the manager more often than not or does the manager barely see the workers? Examples of question I would ask out of curiosity which wouldn't effect my decision that much and which I would find out the answer to when I start working anyways: Would I be allowed to use x/y computer software? Which Operating System would I be coding on (if I get the job)? Would I be working off of existing code / projects or creating on from scratch? 

There is the forest. And then there are the trees. Meaning there are specifics, but then there is the broader issue. And in this case, while your playing around with a live CD is not a risk in any way, the fact you are simply doing that is making you a target. You simply cannot play around with someone else’s equipment like that and not be called out on it. Now that said, maybe the best way to handle this is to find some neutral third party in the school—such as an assistant principal or guidance counsellor—and ask if they could mediate the issue. And by mediate the issue, I mean you will sit down while you calmly, clearly & rationally explain the issue to the system administrator. Now that said, I don’t think you can expect the administrator’s opinion of who you are & what you have done to change. So the best bet is to really lay off on showing off your “133t skills” in that environment. You also say this: 

You basically are playing games with the administrator & showing off to your friends. You need to stop it. Even if it is your own laptop, you are willfully causing confusion in this case. And the administrator has a right to be concerned when someone brings their own equipment into their environment & flirts with system penetration/exploration like that. Yes, the school’s network is Windows & your laptop is running Linux. That doesn’t mean you can’t login remotely via your laptop to do something on a Windows machine. Basically at this point the best you can do is to attempt to mediate an explanation with a third party but a key part of this is quiet simple: You need to stop showing off on other people’s equipment or flirting with the idea of doing that. 

I applied to a software position on March 6th. On March 7th, HR emailed me mentioning that my qualifications might match their job posting, and requested me to do a code review (review code written by someone else. highlighting any issues I find). I did that and got back to them on the same day. HR then said thanks and that they will look over it and get back to me in a day or two. It's been 6 days now and I'm wondering if I should email them, and what I should say in the email? I was thinking emailing them this: 

I'm trying to create an email address which I use for job applications. I'm using Gmail because I don't think I have enough money to buy my own domain (as I've seen suggested on other websites). I don't have a middle name. Assume my first name is William and my last name is Wilson. william.wilson@gmail.com and wilson.william@gmail.com are both already taken. will.wilson, william.wils, w.wilson, w.william, ww.wiliam, ww.wilson, william.ww.wilson are all taken as well (ww is for my initials). I feel like I'll have to use numbers for my work email address (w.wilson02@gmail.com is not taken yet). Do note though that I tried william_wilson@outlook.com and it is not taken yet either, but I've read articles saying that underscores are not professional and should not be used in a work email. 

First red flag. If the code is 10+ years old & failing do you think you are the first person to have ever brought this issue up? You might have an idealistic idea of “changing the company from the inside out”, but I am pretty confident it won’t work this way. 10+ years and software failing without real action reeks of some larger organizational issues at play that a simple recoding won’t solve. For example, perhaps the decision to use the system is not based on it’s real value but rather a political one. Such as an ex-employee everyone liked coded it. Or maybe someone on staff at the company made a decision to use this software & moving away from it would make them look bad which is something your boss does not want to touch with a ten foot pole. 

This sounds like a solution for environmental signage, education & co-worker awareness. If this is an open office plan, is there some way that designated staffers could have some visual cute on their desks or cubicles that indicates, “Hey, these people do content review work… Be cool…” Such as a gold star or some indicia on their cubicle/desk label? And perhaps an explanation on the corporate Intranet coupled with an employee awareness session that basically says: “If you see staff with a gold start on their nameplates, that means they do review of user generated content & they might be viewing material that might seem inappropriate at times but this is all accepted.” Perhaps ask H.R. to include something in orientation/on-baording that will allow the issue to be addressed at the start so nobody is shocked if/when someone comes across someone viewing what might seem like inappropriate content at work?
