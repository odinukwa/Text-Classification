It is correct that the Earth's axial tilt alone would result in an analemma of a figure of eight with equally sized lobes. The axial tilt contributes to the equation of time. Circular Orbit, no Axial Tilt Let's look at an example case with a perfectly circular orbit and no axial tilt, to observe what happens with no equation of time. In this example, it's noon at the equator and prime meridian. The Sun is directly overhead. Next, the Earth rotates exactly once. This isn't a normal solar day, but a sidereal day, about 23 hours, 56 minutes. The Earth has rotated exactly once with respect to the stars. Where is the Sun directly overhead now? The Earth has moved a little bit in it's orbit around the Sun, so that our observer at the equator and 0 degrees longitude has observed that the Sun has moved in the sky with respect to the stars. The Sun is now directly overhead at a location to the east, a little less than 1 degree longitude away (360 degrees in a circle, usually 365 days in a year). The Earth must rotate a little more so that the Sun is directly overhead again (which completes the 24 hours in a day). After each rotation, the Earth must rotate a little more each day to bring the Sun back overhead at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude. After a quarter of a year, the Earth must rotate another quarter of a rotation (90 degrees) for the Sun to be overhead at that spot. Without that extra quarter of a rotation, the Sun is overhead at 90 degrees east longitude. That makes sense; the Earth has moved 90 degrees in its orbit. With a perfectly circular orbit, the rate at which this point moves eastward per day is constant, a little under a degree per day. These points define a great circle around the Earth that coincides with the equator. A great circle is a circle on the surface of a sphere whose center is also the center of the sphere; it's the biggest possible circle that can exist on the surface of a sphere. A Large Axial Tilt Let's keep Earth's perfectly circular orbit, but let's give it a very large axial tilt, 80 degrees, for the purpose of this explanation. This Earth now begins at noon on the northward equinox at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude. After one Earth rotation, where on Earth is the Sun overhead now? It's still a little less than one degree of angle away, but the direction of the displacement has changed. Instead of this point moving due east, it is mostly northward and only a little bit east. The Earth needs to rotate far less than 4 more minutes for the Sun to reach local noon for our observer at 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude. These points are west of where they would be without axial tilt. Solar noon has occurred before 24 hours have passed. As days continue to pass after the equinox, solar noons continue to occur earlier each solar day, as these points continue mostly northward and only a little bit eastward. The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky is moving up and to the right (west is to the right when looking south towards the Sun in the Northern hemisphere). A quarter of a year later, it's the northern solstice, so let's see what has happened to our sun-overhead plots as the sidereal days have piled up. These points have continued to move mostly northward and a little eastward, but now they are moving purely eastward, because at the solstice the sun has stopped moving northward in the sky. It's still moving at a little less than 1 degree per day along that great circle, but because longitude lines are spaced much more closely together at 80 degrees latitude, one degree along a great circle covers many degrees of longitude. In other words, the eastward movement of these points has been "catching up" with the longitude of the corresponding no-axial tilt points. At the solstice, both the no-axial tilt point and the axial tilt point have the same longitude, 90 degrees east. The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky is moving up and to the left (eastward), where it reaches its highest point. These points will continue to move through longitude lines rapidly while the Sun's overhead point remains far in the north. Now, the sun's overhead point is further east than it would be with no axial tilt. The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky is moving down and to the left (eastward). As the southward equinox approaches, the sun-overhead points are moving mostly southward and only a little eastward. The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky is moving down and to the right (westward). This allows the non-axial tilt points to "catch up", and the longitude differences begin to decrease again, until the time of the southward equinox comes, when the two points coincide again. Here is a crude ASCII drawing of these points so far, with longitude along the horizontal direction, and latitude along the vertical direction. 

Parallax is the apparent difference in angle observed due to the differing observing positions. The smaller the parallax, the larger the distance. However, the precision of the resultant calculation depends on the precision of the observations, and measurements of the parallax aren't that precise. In 1716, Edmond Halley published a way to use a transit of Venus to accurately measure the solar parallax, i.e. the difference in the Sun's position in the sky due to observers at different latitudes. 

This study, "Bacterial Spores Survive Simulated Meteorite Impact", seems to indicate that it's possible, though unlikely, for a bacterium to survive the pressure shock from such an impact. So it's plausible that an extremophile bacterium could somehow survive this impact by being on the inside of the meteoroid, surviving the ablation process as a meteor, and not even get warmed up to the surrounding atmospheric temperature when it crashes as a meteorite. There is nothing to indicate that this has actually happened. But what a discovery it would be if something like this were to happen and be confirmed. 

The points around (1) are further west than their corresponding points on the equator. At (2), the points have caught up in longitude. At (3), they are further east than their corresponding points on the equator, but the equator points are catching up. After the southward equinox, the longitudes of the sun-overhead point diverge once again, with the same mechanism as described above for the northward equinox. Just reverse north and south, and the eastward movements are the same. The analemma shape as seen in the Northern hemisphere sky first moves down and to the right, then down and to the left where it reaches its lowest point at the southern solstice, then up and to the left, then up and to the right where it reaches its starting point at the northward equinox. Back to Reality With an axial tilt of 80 degrees, the equation of time would show some extreme values, approaching almost 6 hours of divergence from the no-axial tilt case. With the true axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees, our equation of time difference values are far less substantial, but the effect is real. The true analemma shape we see on Earth is the combined effect of the axial tilt that we have seen plus the fact that Earth's orbit is elliptical and it slows down during the parts of its orbit when it's farther from the Sun and it speeds up during the parts of its orbit when it's closer to the Sun. The site Analemma has good explanations about the individual effects of the elliptical orbit and the axial tilt and how they combine to create our analemma. 

Because of this Aristarchus only got a value of the equivalent of "5 million miles", much too small. Phil Plait has, on his old Bad Astronomy site, an article answering a question about how astronomers originally calculated the distance from the Earth to the Sun (the AU, or astronomical unit). Huygens was the first to calculate this distance with any kind of accuracy at all. 

The synodic month is the "average period of the Moon's revolution with respect to the line joining the Sun and Earth". However, the Earth also moves in its orbit around the Sun during this month. From our vantage point, the Sun has appeared to move in the sky with respect to the background stars, in the same direction as the Moon moves in the sky with respect to the background stars. Your calculation deals with the sidereal month, so your result is the calculation of the sidereal year. When the Sun returns to the same spot in the sky, that is the sidereal year, whose length is 365.256363004 days, very close to your calculation. So why is that off from the tropical year by 20 minutes? Because the tropical year (the year that keeps the seasons in place throughout the calendar year) is slightly shorter than the sidereal year. 

The book The Transits of Venus, by Sheehan and Westfall, describes how Aristarchus used Hipparchus' calculation of the Earth-Moon distance, who in turn used Eratosthenes' calculation of the Earth's circumference, to calculate the Earth-Sun distance. Aristarchus of Samos was the first to seriously calculate the distance to the Sun, using geometry. When the Moon is exactly half illuminated when seen from the Earth (first or last quarter phase), then there is a right triangle between the Earth, Moon, and Sun, with the Moon at the right angle. Then he could measure the angular distance in the sky between the Sun and the Moon, plus the Earth-Moon distance and geometry, to get the Earth-Sun distance. 

I'm sure that there are formulas that would predict which areas would be in the path of totality/annularity, but they would not be simple. They would depend on exactly when new moon occurs and the exact distance of the moon from the earth. That would control which strip along the equator would see the eclipse and how wide it would be. Because the moon slows down in its orbit when it's further away from the earth, and it speeds up in its orbit when it's closer to the earth, the time between new moons is not constant. The fact that Earth's own orbit around the sun is also elliptical, and it also slows down/speeds up when it is far/close from/to the Sun complicates this as well.
