Youtube channel veritasium, on a video called "The real moral dilemma of self-driving cars" (ref) claims that if all cars in 2017 were self-driving, hundreds of lives could be saved. So he is claming that the self-driving technology of 2017 would be less lethal (regarding number of deaths in car accidents versus miles driven) than human drivers. That a self-driving car has a higher mileage per death than human driven cars. Is it so? 

The ISNA has a article on how confusing this can be (link) and they don't give out a clear definition, so I won't quote that one. But in their "10 intersex myths", they state: 

So the 1.7% is valid if you agree with Fausto-Sterling et alia definition of intersex, that is contested as too broad by other authors. 

Since the 1940's, numerous studies have been published regarding paternal discrepancy; here's a fairly comprehensive list. Also, four meta-studies ( literature surveys ) are listed. Bellis is listed as both the co-author of some of the individual studies, and a 2005 meta-study. Quote from the abstract: 

From the map above, we can estimate the minimum number of alcohol-attributable deaths to 10% of Russia's 2010 deaths ( 2028516 ), which gives us ~200.000, and the maximum ( 1/5 of the total ) to ~400.000. In 2004, 3.8% of all global deaths were attributable to alcohol, 6.2% for men and 1.1% for women. As for the ethnic identity of the drinkers, from this study: 

This claim doesn't seem to have any factual underpinning; none of the books about Catherine the Great support it. While I haven't read any of them, I did read the reviews on Amazon, and none mentioned such an event; some reviewers specifically point out that there are no records of Catherine the Great having equestrian sex partners. In addition, a number of other on-line resources discuss this issue, and all come to the same conclusion, that this rumor is false. From europeanhistory.about.com: 

Having worked at the Amazon Mechanical Turk for a long time, I find that some ReCaptcha questions are very similar to the 1c tasks there. Identify this, identify that. A search shows that several web authors share the same suspicion. Most of them are high in the tinfoil scale, so they are not that reliable of a source. Included below for notability purposes. claim source 1 claim source 2 claim source 3 WP/ReCaptcha#criticism claim source 5 Given that Google is not a charity, and that recaptcha is free, the claim might hold water. What is Google getting out of ReCaptcha? Free labour? Big data behavioural analysis? Something else? 

No. A probiotic food, as defined by the dictionaries (1) (2) (3) must contain benefical live bacteria (regarding the human organism). Scientific literature calls those bacteria probiotic (4). Tequila does not contain these benefical live bacteria, as its alcohol concentration would at least atenuate them if not outright kill (lactobacilli are more fragile than pathogenic bacteria) them. Also they are not part of the production process; tequila is fermented with yeast, not bacteria and if these bacteria would be later added, would have to follow FDA regulations and be declared. Not to be mistaken for prebiotic that identifies foods that enhance the presence of benefical gut bacteria, but does not contain them in a live and active state. 

According to existing evidence, it is true that Russians drink a lot of alcohol. 1. Adult Per Capita Consumption The World Health Organization 2011 Global status report on alcohol and health provides us with statistics in regard to average alcohol consumption per year, for people aged 15 and above, in liters of pure alcohol. Russia ranks fourth, with 15.76 liters ( of which 6.88 liters are consumed in the form of "spirits" ), more than double the world average - 6.13. 2. Alcoholism The report provides no information specifically about alcoholism prevalence in Russia, but using The Global Information System on Alcohol and Health ( $URL$ ) shows Russia as having the highest rate of males aged between 18 and 65, which are dependent on alcohol: 17.61% 3. Mortality The report tells us that Russia has one of the highest proportion of alcohol-attributable mortality, but doesn't give precise numbers - most of the data in this report is given by WHO subregion. According to Wolfram Alpha, 8327 deaths per year occur due to alcohol use disorders - 0.35% of the total, much higher than the world probability of 0.16%. However, this figure doesn't seem to be accurate according to the WHO report - which, although it doesn't give exact numbers, does say: 

Note that it only states anatomical differences, while the studies above include other categories. Other source dispute the broadness of the definitions used by those articles [3] - from their abstract (ellipsis mine, follow previous link for the full text): 

That seems an awfully high rate. BBC does not cite any sources. Is this 1.7% figure reliable? (note: the article is about Kenya, but I am interested only in the worldwide figure. 

The cost of feeding a child supposedly is "a little over $1 a day" (USD$ or CAD$ ??) don't trust data that came from a 5 min google search 

Is the sum of gross revenue of all the candy crush over all mobile platforms enough to feed a million children in africa? 

Raninfall varies greatly in the UK, depending on the region. The map below illustrates this point better than words. It is interesting to note that London is actually in one of the driest regions of UK. 

In conclusion, it would appear that the widely held beliefs hold true - Russian do drink a lot, much more than the world average. It appears to be a huge problem for the country, and for many of countries that were part of USSR. Medvedev called Russia's drinking problem a "national disaster". 

As you can see from the above, you might be hard-pressed to find a city with less rainfall than London, although other regions ( the mountainous north-west ) do have high rainfall amounts.
