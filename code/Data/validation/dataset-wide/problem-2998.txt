This is Matthew Arnolds 'night of the world' where the 'night-wind' blows on a 'darkling plain' where armies 'clash by night' and it leaves the world 'naked' and the 'sea of faith ... was once ... full' but he only hears now its 'melancholy, withdrawing roar' (this might be an example of 'self-withdrawal' writ large - the Self is often used in translations of the Indian Upanishads denoting something like Spirit); this was written in 1851, and roughly contemperary with Nietzsches announcement of the 'Death of God', another event that went unremarked by most, to add further validation Badious conception of an event, but which is quite visible today with secularite - once a midpoint of toleration of differing and contentious religious views to becoming a kind of a contending power with them. The extracts, by the way are from Badious Ethics, again in Hallwards introduction but before the section you've quoted. 

I'm not sure that this is a fallacy as such, but a problematic (where I am reading fallacy as being something that is always definitely wrong). 

All of the Indian schools use these pramanas to some degree and with differing but related interpretations. The Nyaya school of logic held a kind of realism; holding that true knowledge is humanly knowable through argument ie philosophical reflection; they hold Inference as the primary means to true knowledge; they don't disbar supernatural possibilities ie the existence of Ishvara (God). A more radical school is the Carvaka school; they can be thought as a materialist school - in that they reject supernatural phenomena. They hold Perception as the primary mode of knowledge. 

I'd argue against your thesis. We don't always formalise conception; simply because many concepts are not amenable to formalisation. Kant for example, made a heroic effort in trying to formalise ethics - his axiom being the categorical imperative. What is true is that many concepts are studied, and their study turns into a scientia - that is a domain of knowledge. I use the word scientia delberately to differentiate this from modern science, which is one form of scientia. Even in mathematics, where formalisation is important; in fact, so important in the contemporary situation that there is a philosophy of mathematics that is associated with it; formalisation hasn't always been important. For example, arithmetic as opposed to plane geometry wasn't axiomatised in Ancient Greece, but in the late 19C, over two millenia later; an interval of over 2 millenia hardly speaks of always and must. 

No, I don't think it is wise to see emotions and intelligence as algorithms. It certainly isn't the traditional way to think about the world of human experience. One reason to think of algorithims is that one can do things with them. Crucially this aspect is missing from intelligence seen as algorithmic. One can certainly simulate certain kinds of thinking with algorithms but this does not show that they are the same thing. What one is doing is modelling. Physics, for example models the physical world - but one should not then make the mistake that the physical world is physics. The Turing test takes a functionalist view of intelligence. Quite crucially Turing ignores the fact of inner life. I'd argue that thinking is intrinsically tied up with inner life. To ignore it doesn't mean that its not there, or that its not important, but renders the question more tractable. 

This is a repudation of Gods hand in the world (order), but an affirmation of science (necessity) in the world. But I find it provocative to consider whether a perfect chaos is possible; one that, that is one in which is the exact anti-thesis of order? That is no information can be deduced? Or is it a self-contradictory notion? For example, take a perfect gas; one can deduce pressure, temperature and entropy; its volume, desnity and mass. These are bulk properties; but one can also deduce information about its micro-motions aka Brownian Motion - that is a random walk as a limit. For a perfect chaos, one should be unable todeduce any information in principle; if not in fact. One could say then it indescribable. Is this possible? The apeiron of Anaximander - the boundless - seems a possibility; but as Nietzsche notes, it must have an inner law of necessity that forms the world from it. Another possibility is Kants noumenon; it is explicitly indescribable. 

It appears like circular reasoning; but it isn't quite because it analyses the virtuous person in terms of knowing what to do (1) and doing or performing it (2); and that these two parts need to be tied together (3) looking at the contrapositives might make this more easy to understand: 

Although atoms had been discussed since antiquity as a theory of matter it was only at the beginning of the 20th century that convincing evidence was found, through brownian motion - in fact this was the same 'evidence' alluded to by Lucretious in his poem de Rerum Natura, as well the theory of elements in chemistry. Although atoms were too small to see by even the most powerful microscope it was natural t think that they had the same kind of reality as a rock, as one could just simply imagine shrinking a rock to the dimensions of an atom. It was then quickly discovered that atoms had been misnamed - they weren't the smallest particles of matter - these were elctrons, protons & neutrons. Of course, after the advent of QM and in particular QFT the picture changed. Instead of a particle we had a particle field. In the physical theory this is defined at every point of spacetime. Doubt was thrown on the naive realism for the ontology of atoms had before. An instrumentalist/operational ontology seems unsatisfying to me - as this doesn't seem like a proper ontology - is it natural to assume that the electron field is physically real. This subsumes the operational perspective, since then a measurement just measures an interaction with the field - so measurements are real. I mean by the physical reality of the field that they have the same kind of reality as a rock. What are the problems or criticisms can be made for this view? It appears strange for example, we can say that a field is physically real and so is a rock but their physical reality differs. By this I'm not claiming physicalism, that everything in the world is physical. Or that only physical laws are real. Is a fair criticism is that we have no right to expect that physicists won't decide a better model of an electron is not a field but (for want of a better word) a forest - a new mathematical gadget. Are we then committed to the reality of a forest, and no longer to the field? 

I think that this is actually a good question that could be made better by asking are humans risk averse. Many human Beings gamble with their health - smoking and drugs. Some people will knowingly and willingly go to certain death - suicide bombers. Some people will knowingly and willingly seek out dangerous thrills - gambling, mountaineering and other extreme sports. The 20th century documents in great detail - War and violence - these are not risk averse activities. I don't know a great deal of economic theory - but my understanding is that risk is positively correlated with gain. The greater the risk the greater the possible gain. Behavioral economics critically examines the assumption that human beings are rational agents - on the face of it this does not seem to be true. It seems to be a generally assumed axiom for the fortuitous flow of nice economic results that follow rather than one upheld by critical observation. Human beings are far more often irrational than rational. Rationality is a key concept for developing the idea of risk-aversion rigorously. After all to be risk averse one has to coolly weigh the risks involved in decisions. The other concept that requires critical examination is the idea of perfect availability of information to all participants - just looking cursorily at any market shows that there are huge information asymmetries. These are two solid pillars of classical economics which upon examination really are quite risible. Its fairly obvious that once one begins to look at how classical economics is constructed that it has been carefully modelled on physics. The rational agent - compare with the rational atom which collates all its collisions and then calculates the trajectory that it must embark on. Perfect information - the perfect fluid or perfect gas of classical 19th century physics. With no viscosity and no friction. These assumptions are made to make the physics easy. If for example the atmosphere was a perfect gas we would have no weather. By analogy, one could suppose that building this assumption in classical economics one may have nice theorems but no actual - that is real economics. There is an old adage in programming folklore - garbage in, garbage out. There is a converse that is appropriate here - perfection in, perfection out. 

Pythagoras was interested in the application of mathematics to problems of cosmology; this is a discipline now called cosmology. Aristotle was interested in questions of space, time, place, matter and continuity; this discipline is now called physics. Plato was interested in questions of what constituted good governance, this is the discipline that is called political philosophy and ethics. As for the negative in philosophy, one might usefully think on the following remarks by Chantal Mouffe, the Belgian political theorist, in her book Agonistic Poltics: 

One can concieve, obviously, what exists; for example, a Walrus; but also what can possibly exist, though in fact it doesn't, never has or might never be; for example, a unicorn. He is told, it isn't possible to concieve what isn't possible to concieve. This, itself, is a conception; something then can be possibly concieved - I just did it, and wrote it. And not to be confused with what is in-itself, is not - at all. This, then - doesn't nullify the path pointed out by the goddess. It's worth pointing out that though Aristotle is dismissive of Parmenidean accounts of nature - this is as mere platitude or sophistry 

In both Christian & Islamic thought the universe is created, and this is taken that the universe had a definite beginning; philosophically we can justify this position by arguing that were we to trace time back it can only go back a finite amount of time. But suppose that the universe was eternal, it exists now, and it has always existed. Putting aside the problem of time here - that is how can an infinite amount of time pass, which is perhaps partially resolved by postulating a cyclical universe, we can still ask can a God create an Eternal universe. Or does the notion of an Eternal universe dispense with the notion of Creation altogether. Let us examine time, in the simple-minded analogy of geometry: For the usual notion of a created universe, we mark a point in the ground here to mark the originary point, and as time passes we trace a straight line right of that point, and this line stretches on - geometrically we get a half-infinite line stretching to the East; now for the eternal universe we have no originary point for us to get us started as we did before, but having the power of imagination at hand, we simply posit an infinite line. We stand outside of that line, looking at this line that represents the eternal universe. It seems then, plausible, that an eternal universe doesn't neccessarily dispense with the notion of Creation. It appears that it even more marks the fact that, if creation did happen, it must have happened outside of time, space & causality. However, one notes that an eternal universe can be created, and noting that there is a present time, then the universe appears to then be created in media res. 

Well, there is a midway point in the programme of logicism; which is reducing mathematics not to logic but to set theory. Now, in this theory it is the notion of a set that is basic, and then the notion of a function is derived; it turns out that one can reverse this, and take the notion of a function as basic, and the notion of a set as derived; this theory is called category theory, and in fact if you axiomatise the notion of a function this is what you get; it has more of an algebraic flavour than set theory, which has more of a logical flavour; which perhaps isn't surprising, when one considers their background - set theory came out of investigations of logic, and category theory from algebraic topology. Category theory didn't come out of study of foundations; in fact, the authors of the theory, in their first penned paper on it, supposed it would be the last! It's only in the last few decades that Category Theory has been mooted as an alternative foundation for mathematics; this will be an uphill struggle, given how much effort has been invested already in Set Theoretical foundations. Category theory tends to be plural - there are many useful categories, of which Set is one; whereas Set Theory insists that Set is the one and true category of which all others bud off; personally speaking, I prefer the plural vision.
