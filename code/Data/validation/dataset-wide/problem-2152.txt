The whole company connection is very confusing. As long as you fulfill the contracts, there is no time you "must" stay in a job situation you don't like. Everybody makes mistakes. You will not be labelled anything if you make one mistake. Just make sure that your next step is the right one. A contract that is completed is always a good point to consider what you want to do next. If company A is what you really want, then go for it. You could also look at other companies, maybe there are better offers. 

Obviously there is a communication problem. But right now, you have conflicting information. A said something. B said something else. The correct way to handle this is not bureaucracy, reports or relying on unproven accusations. The correct way is to invite coworkers A and B into a room with you and asking them what happened. You can then find out how to proceed. Maybe it's just a misunderstanding. Maybe you will get actual criticism. Maybe it will end badly and you will need to file a report. But you need to find out in a professional way. By communicating with both A and B. 

I will assume you use the same clock when you sign in and when you sign out. So whatever you lost when you signed in will be gained when you sign out or vice versa. The only warning sign would be, if the clock is showing another wrong time when you leave. If it's always late by the same amount, that's ok. After all, it should measure how much time you spent, not the exact minute you got in. 

I recently quit from my first job out of college. I been there nearly a decade. I do miss the place and sometimes feel a bit of "emptiness" when I think back on it. I miss the people and the place a little. Then I think about why I quit there. I think about the things I do dislike and realize I made a wise choice. I think when you depart, you sort of only remember the good things. That's natural to do. I remember a lot of good things about my previous employer. But then I remember the bad things that made me want to leave and I know I made a wise choice for the better. I recall a research done. I looked up information like you did on quitting and I recall reading a research that some folks talk really, really bad about their employer and quit on those grounds. Then shortly after they realize they made a terrible mistake and the last job was actually really good. I think what these research fail to see is that people quit a job to a new job without researching the new job. They just jumped on the chance for a new job since they were angry with their current employer. I would say so long as you don't do that, you should be okay. The feeling generally goes away after a few months or so, at least for me. 

It's okay to write in your email that you don't know how to spell the person's name you briefly met at a fair. I would just acknowledge you aren't positive of the spelling since you never exchanged business cards. Trust me, nobody will remember that. 

Do you have an annual or 6-month review? If not, ask for one. And a formal one, where you can get documentation stating whether or not you are doing a satisfactory job, and if there are improvements your director would like you to make. Start the review searching for these answers and seeking approval, then when it's your turn to talk about how you're feeling in the role, bring the job description with the salary listed and ask about it. Find out: Is this a different role than mine? What is the career trajectory for this role? What do I need to do to reach the next step? If you're feeling brave and know you're doing a good job: Where did this compensation come from, and is there any reason I'm not eligible for this rate? You may find that your director doesn't actually know you're being paid differently than someone else, and it's the company's mistake to disclose salary details for the same position if they're paying one person less. Good luck! 

Working time in Germany is regulated by the "Arbeitszeitgesetz (ArbZG)", the law concerning time spent working. 

You need to show them the benefit of doing so. Before you take any action, individually or not, it would be good to get together and talk about it. Because you are perfectly right that people in a group have more power than each of them individually. The first step would be to invite them for a beer (or barbecue) after hours and talk about what you all want from your employer. When you know what you want, it's time to talk about how to reach it. If you think a union is the way to go, you will need to present the benefits of a union over not joining a union. Maybe you can get a union representative to join your second meeting and explain those benefits. A word of warning: you have not mentioned any benefit of joining a union here. You have not convinced anyone here. Be prepared that you need more facts to convince any of your colleagues. And in the end, be prepared to do this without joining a union if your colleagues do not want to do so. Joining a union is a means to an end, don't lose sight of your actual goal over choosing a tool to reach it. 

I honestly don't think it is relevant to list Undergrad degrees when you have a master. I would just list the masters. The part about you pursuing a phd is quite important because it would tell a employer that you plan to pursue it and potentially limit your work schedule and/or work at different hours. 

The worst they can say is no. However you can predict what their answer will be based on several factors. For one, and probably most importantly, if they still have a position open. And secondly, going to largely depend on how you left the company. If you put in your two weeks, and left on good notice, then it's going to come down really to whether or not they have a position open. When you quit a job, always make sure you don't burn any bridges. That means giving them a two weeks notice, and never telling them that you dislike them or anything. However, for future employers don't tell them that you were "frustrated" with your last job. Instead, just say you left to pursue new opportunities. Remember, don't ever say anything bad about your last company. 

Maybe some things aren't meant to be a "learning" opportunity. Rather it is what it is and there is nothing to be "learned" from it. It sounds like your manager is telling you to take the "chillax" approach to things. So the IT department can't handle your request. That sounds great. Just tell that to whoever requested it. Just say, "Hey, I just submitted something to IT and they're saying I have to give a reason to fit the goal of the company. Here's what I said..." Then just chillax. Your part of it is done. I would say bureaucratic nonsense is hardly a "learning experience" because everywhere is different. I suppose you could "learn" something by it. First, don't expect anything immediately and think of it like oiling a really jammed up gear. Just slowly drip oil in it, and eventually it'll loosen up. Might take a long time, sure, but the most important thing is not to get frustrated by it. Just slowly keep at it, and slowly things will start moving. It sounds like your boss is cluing you in that things aren't suppose to move fast just yet so you shouldn't worry too much. He didn't say you were doing a bad job, just complaining about it too much because you want things done too soon when it isn't suppose to. 

Talking to your boss should have an actionable goal. Something your boss can do to improve the situation. For example 

The average salary range in 2015 was 40K to 60K depending on region. Personally I'd say that's for experienced people, I surely did not start out on €40K. Please note that for everyone above that, to be an average, someone has to be below it. As a software developer you won't get stinkin' rich, but even with a below average salary, you can easily finance a rented apartment, car, family and holiday trips. Being paid below average is not the end of the world, you can live a pretty happy life with the wages of a software engineer even below average. German salaries vary a lot because a good part of the salary is used to cover the cost of living. For example, for €40K one can easily and comfortably live in Hannover (capital of a federal state) while making 40K in Munich (capital of another federal state) probably means you have to sleep under a bridge or live out of town and commute for 1-2 hours. As you relocate here, I would expect the company to offer you the normal salary they offer all their employees. If it's a large company, they may have something called a "Tarifvertrag", a contract between their union and the company what to pay for which job. If they do have one, that's great on one hand because they will not be allowed to pay you less and you can be relatively sure that the colleagues that do the same job get paid the same. On the other hand, it's harder to get more, too, because that's bureaucratic overhead. Your best bet probably is to tell them that you tried to get information about German salary structures but the range is so wide that you'd rather hear their offer first. If you have to quote, I'd not just quote a number, but also include how you got there. That makes it easier on their part to react to it. For example, if you said "50k" and they cannot pay 50K, that's bad. If you say "People told me 50K is the average for your region", then it's easier for them to jump in and reply with "that's correct, we pay a bit below average but we offer those other benefits...". 

National holidays in the US are not guaranteed to be paid. If you are a W2 FTE (full-time employee on your company's payroll), then consult your employee handbook which should outline your vacation & holiday plan for the company. If you are a 1099 contractor or working through a third party (staffing/recruiting firm), then first consult the person responsible for your payroll to understand how holidays work. Then bring your problem with a solution to your manager. An example might be: "In order to avoid working less hours and therefore being paid less for the week of 7/3/2017, I'm planning to work four 10-hour days Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Please confirm this is approved." Make sure to get the approval in writing. 

When negotiating an employment contract, it's important to ensure all communication is documented in writing. If it's past the point where that is possible (which it sounds like it is), then I would schedule time with the individual with whom you negotiated and agreed to taking vacation before your probationary period was passed, and discuss this. After your discussion and assuming this person still maintains this is an okay exception to the norm, document it in writing. Example: "Thank you for your time today. Per our conversation, during our interview on Month, Day, Year, about my employment at Company XYZ, we discussed previously planned vacations and my ability to take those days off using Paid Time Off before my probationary period was up. Please confirm this is still the case. Thank you for understanding and I'll be sure to stay on track with my work." Style it how you want, but be sure to get them to agree or approve in writing.
