I'm guessing that's part of a casual conversation. Well, it's summertime, and a security audit is a long and painful process, so I completely understand where your colleague is coming from. That said, it's a necessary process, and probably an urgent one, since you've already identified some issues, and the developer did everything but outright admit that there are further issues. If you doing your job creates friction between the two of you, well, then it's probably time for management to intervene. However, I strongly believe that a team fails as a team, and really don't appreciate the blame game. Before you do anything you really need to be absolutely certain that you aren't overreacting over something that was more of a casual and possibly humorous comment than an actual request for you to postpone / dismiss the security tests. 

One cup and one plate per person. Seriously, nothing else works. Hide cups and plates (in case you need them, for a customer or something) and only leave one cup and one plate per person. People will either start cleaning up for themselves or for others if they want to use them. I've done it twice, and it worked both times. The first time people started cleaning up for themselves, the second time they started bringing plastic cups and plates from home. In any case, the kitchen was clean. 

A few of my colleagues have a tendency of sending a variety of off topic emails, ranging from the usual "funny" stuff to serious, but still not work related stuff. I really don't like that, my inbox is extremely busy as it is, other than the usual work related emails I get a ton of automated emails, from our PM software, our build & deploy services and a couple other bots. On top of that, I'm working remotely, and email is my main method of communication with the company. I could be deleting all the crap as they come, but that's not really a solution if they just keep coming. A messy inbox leads to messy search results, every time I don't delete a "funny" email, it just pops up in a search result six months later. Email search being as inefficient as it is, this becomes very tiresome after a while. How can I, once and for all, put an end to the madness? Most of my colleagues are IT professionals, I feel that they should be very accustomed to email culture, and I really don't understand why any of them would feel the need to share the latest cute kitty picture they fished out of Reddit with the whole IT department, or why they don't just send it to my personal email. Working remotely also means that I'm at a disadvantage when it comes to one on one discussions. Small clarification: "co-worker" includes management, up to the top of the hierarchy. Not the main culprits, but it's not unreasonable to think that they enable the behaviour by setting a bad example (once in a while). 

If it were for a longer amount of time, say a few months, I'd include it. As it is, I'd leave it off, and then explain it at the interview ("Actually, no, Foocorp was not most recent job. I did a two week stint with BazInc after that. It ended so quickly that I felt it would be misleading to list them.") Past that, you try to be as honest as possible while emphasizing any positive aspects, the same as anything else in your job history. 

I don't see it as any more of an issue than the logos that staffing companies sometimes add to the top of your resume when they reformat it into their style. 

For a larger company, this is unusual. They generally want to control the equipment being used both for security and general standardization reasons. For a smaller company, particularly one where a) there's a lot of telecommuting, b) total number of employees is small, or c) work is based on available contracts, it becomes more viable. Look at it as being similar to delivery places that require drivers to own their own car. It puts an onus of responsibility on the developer to keep up their equipment, and insulates the company against losses if an employee suddenly leaves the company. I've personally been in this situation with one software company for which I telecommuted. They had some minimum standards for the computers used, and they provided software licenses, but otherwise, the onus was on me to maintain my hardware. I was one of six developers, and the company didn't make a ton of money, so it just made more sense to let developers make use of their own resources. 

Honestly, your best recourse is to tell them exactly that, that you're struggling. Not everyone is suited for every job, and it's better for your supervisor to know that you're struggling than to have them learn much later. Tell them what exactly you've been doing to fathom it, where you feel like you're just not getting it, and ask for their advice. Honestly, sometimes it's just a matter of that you're going about it the wrong way, perhaps that they need to start you on something more basic, and sometimes you're just not going to get it. I had to acknowledge the second when working in speech recognition. I just couldn't get it, and I was much happier once assigned to something else. 

A very popular choice in Europe is the Europass, an initiative of the European Commission's Directorate-General for Education and Culture. Other than a standard CV, the Europass offers tools for: 

How do you avoid discussing anything non work related at work? The interest around politics may have peaked after the debate in the US, but in Greece politics (and more specifically the economy) is what everyone is interested in discussing for at least the past couple of years. You'd imagine that it would be far more difficult for us to avoid such discussions, but it really isn't. Just don't talk about politics yourself, and politely excuse yourself from the company when someone else starts the discussion. Coincidentally I've worked in two environments which can be considered polar opposites when it comes to discussing politics, one was a town hall (where politics were actually our work) and the other was the Army (where discussing politics is strictly forbidden). Couple of years after I left my position at the town hall, that involved regular meetings with elected officials, my co-workers there were surprised to find out that (at the time) I was a supporter of a minor opposition party. I had spend nearly seven years in an environment where politics were all there was to talk about without disclosing my own affiliations. I just never talked about it ;) Every workplace is different, but I don't think that in a typical workplace there's much room or time for non work related discussions. Certainly we all take a break once in a while, and we all might get caught in an uncomfortable discussion around the water cooler, but those discussions tend to be short (how long can your break really be?) and easy to evade. My standard excuse when things start getting uncomfortable, or I'm simply not interested in the discussion, is that... I have to get back to work. Simple, isn't it? 

If your current status is "waiting for Joe to finish what he's working on", then Joe (and everyone else on the team) should know about it. It's your manager's / scrum master's responsibility to either help Joe finish a bit faster, or find you something else to do while you wait. That's what stand up meetings are all about, keeping the team informed of every member's current status. 

Most of all, be patient. It's not unusual to not hear anything back these days, and you're far from alone. As long as you follow the company's instructions for applying, you don't have to do anything special to make sure HR tracks your resume. If they dumped it, it means they weren't interested. 

There is nothing special about "companies in California". If you're willing to relocate to your job site, most companies across the US won't care where you currently reside. There will always be some exceptions: small companies may only be interested in hiring locally, some positions may have a preference for those with local knowledge, etc. In the case of my team, we recently had an opening for a short-term (6 months) contract position, and we only looked for local candidates because our company offers relocation assistance, and my manager didn't want to shoulder that cost for an intern position. But in general, with large corporations in particular, where you currently live is far less important that where you will be living when you're on the job. 

If both your HR department and management are unable or unwilling to address the behavior, you may have to seek legal counsel outside the company. Laws will vary by locality, but this behavior may fall under sexual harassment or "hostile work environment" in the US. Again, I would avoid bringing up the criminal history. I think you have a strong enough case considering current behavior. If you bring up the conviction, people may perceive your complaints as an attempt to punish him for past behavior that he has (presumably) already been punished for. 

I currently have the company name, employment dates, location, title, and project/responsibility descriptions for every position, so this layout would save me a lot of whitespace between the entries. Additionally, the earlier internships currently contain somewhat extraneous bullet points just because I don't like having a job entry with only one bullet point. This new layout would help me focus my descriptions on only the most important details without leaving awkward-looking job entries. 

How can I craft a response to these students that says "we have no openings and please don't contact me again", in a way that is professional but firm? 

Conclusion Without knowing the terms of the contract, it's hard to say if you should or not. I tend to take a conservative approach to these kinds of things, so I would say breaking the contract is not worth it, but a reasonable person may come to the opposite conclusion. You'll have to balance the potential negative consequences with the possible upsides of research and publication opportunities and decide for yourself.
