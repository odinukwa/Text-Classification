While taking a group of benefactors on a tour through the new aviary they had just helped to build, a noted ornithologist commented, "And here we have two of the finest examples of ravens that I have ever seen. Notice the lustrous black plumage for which all ravens are famous." The ornithologist continued his lecture, commenting on the corvine feeding and nesting habits as well as on the birds' legendary role as harbingers of ill fortune. When the ornithologist had finished, a young man said, "Sir, excuse me, but did you say that 'All ravens are black'?" "I don't know if I said exactly that, but it's true. All ravens are black." "But, how do you know that - for certain, I mean?" asked the young man. "Well, I've seen a few hundred ravens in my day and every one of them has been black." "Yes, but a few hundred are not all. How many ravens are there, anyway?" "I would guess several million. As for your question, many other scientists, and non-scientists for that matter, have observed ravens over thousands of years and so far the birds have all been black. At least, I don't know of a single instance in which someone has produced a non-black raven." "That's true, but it's still not all - just most." "True, but there is other evidence. For example, take all these lovely multicolored birds we have seen today - the parrots, toucans, the peacocks -" "They're lovely, but what do they have to do with your claim that all ravens are black?" "Don't you see?" asked the ornithologist. "No, I don't see. Please explain." "Well, you accept the idea that every new instance of another black raven that is observed adds to the support of the generalization that all ravens are black?" "Yes, of course." "Well then, the statement 'All ravens are black' is logically equivalent to the statement 'All non-black things are non-ravens.' This being so and because whatever confirms a statement also confirms any logically equivalent statement, it's clear that any non-black non-raven supports the generalization 'All ravens are black.' Hence, all these colorful, non-black non-ravens also support the generalization." "That's ridiculous," chided the young man. "In that case you might as well say that your blue jacket and gray pants also confirm the statement 'All ravens are black.' After all, they're also non-black non-ravens." "That's correct," said the ornithologist. "Now you're beginning to think like a true scientist." Who is reasoning correctly, the ornithologist or the young man? 

In "Reference and Meaning" Putnam mentions, as an aside, that language requires a certain "division of linguistic labor" that has not been previously recognized. By this, as I take it, he simply means the modern social situation in which many words or concepts, such as the term "atom," cannot be analyzed by most people who use them. They depend upon a hierarchy in which the proper use of a growing number of commonly used terms implicitly depend upon agreements among experts, who can presumably supply reasonably consistent definitions if asked. As I say, this is merely a brief aside in this famous essay. Its implications would seem to be largely sociological. (My own interest is in the class structure of symbolic systems, more specifically in "money," and a multi-tiered use of ostensibly constant monetary terms and denominations within a shared money exchange system.) Is Putnam's idea here one that is well-known or has been developed elsewhere? Or are there similar concepts in philosophy, or in specifically linguistic-symbolic areas of sociology, that might prove fruitful in my amateur researches? Again, my general interest is in the formal structure of common terms that may function with double meanings based on "class hierarchy" within a single community of speakers. 

As others have noted, the question you are asking is most famously addressed in philosophy by Kant's Critique of Judgment. Unfortunately, Kant's system is somewhat idiolectic and not amenable to brief, clear summaries. Phillip Klocking's answer, while accurate, has not only indicated as much, but--if I may be excused for saying so--demonstrated it as well. Aesthetics refers in the Greek to sensation and feeling, and was often contrasted unfavorably with "reasoning" or logic. Its status shifted when the British Empiricists argued that all true knowledge was derived from the senses and only manipulated by logic, as if by a calculator. This left the validity of reasoned judgments and moral judgments open to skepticism. Weren't they just based in the senses, and thus purely contingent? Kant was especially concerned about the "relativity" of morals. He attempts to show that our "judgments" are not randomly based in passing sensations. Our sensations and experiences are only comprehensible because they already have a rational structure a priori. This structure is not arbitrary, because it is necessary for all "rational beings" and "rational judgments." This inner structure of concepts organizes all of our sensations and judgments in an essentially "universal" way...at least as far as human beings go. As you can guess, this places "aesthetics" in a different light. Prior to Kant, artistic judgments were considered a matter of "taste" and possibly "breeding." It was no more important to philosophy or reason than which food one prefers. No one would logically argue about which food is "better" or "truer." It's just a contingent matter of taste based on passing sensations and personal experience. But Kant noted that we do indeed tend to argue that a painting, novel, or symphony is "superior" to pulp. That a beautiful old forest is "better" than a functional parking lot. (Kant was, in fact, more concerned with beauty in nature than art, and it is easier to see his arguments in this way. Not unlike E. O. Wilson's "biophilia.") When we make such aesthetic judgments, we do expect others to agree, as if to an argument. They seem deeper and closer to our innate "reasoning" than simple matters of taste. Kant developed the idea of aesthetic judgment as a sort of pure "conceptualizing," in the loose sense, without content, a feeling of "purposefulness" minus any specified "purpose." It was not simply the casual impact of the senses determining a subjective judgment. It was an act of "inner causation," the pure exercise of our very powers of judgment. Needless to say, all the gory Kantian details are missing in my crude synopsis. But I hope this gives you some direction. Kant was the first to reintroduce aesthetics into modern philosophy, and his Critique of Judgment is where your answer begins. In more recent philosophy, "linguistic structure" or "sociobiology" or "cognitive sciences" may pursue something similar, if less coherent, in their attempts to relate sensations to universal attributes of "mind," or rational judgment. 

The structure of Structuralism is made explicit by Jean Piaget in his "little" book, "Structuralism", 1970 Wholeness, where elements are governed by laws & not just an aggregate composite Transformation, dynamicity and change again according to rules or laws (In this sub-section 3 of the Introduction, on transformation, Piaget, referencing Godel' methods, is adamant that the relation between structuralism and constructivism is no longer avoidable. (That intuition provides much of what we then proceed to axiomize.) And thirdly, Self-regulation (& self-maintenance) which involves rhythm, regulation and operation as the mechanism In "Structuralism", also, Piaget cites the French group know as the Bourbaki. Piaget, however also states on p.27 of a chapter called "Mathematical and Logical Structures" and two years before Mac Lane's "Categories for the Working Mathematician" the following. What we have in mind are the "categories" of MacLane, Eilenburg, and others' The "categories" of of the new branch of the Bourbaki school are classes which comprise "functions" and therefore "morphisms" among their elements (a function, in the usual acceptance of the word, being the application of one set to another [or itself], obviously engenders isomorphisms, in fact every variety of "morphism".) Then on P. 28 he cites S. Papert's observation that "MacLane's categories are a device for laying hold of mathematical operations rather than of "mathematics" itself: they constitute yet another example of that reflective abstraction which derives its substance, not from objects, but from operations performed upon objects even when the latter are themselves products of reflective abstraction" In "Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists" Benjamin C. Pierce quotes in the preface What we are probably seeking is a "purer" view of functions: a theory of functions in themselves, not a theory of functions derived from sets. What, then, is a pure theory of functions? Answer: category theory --Scott [104,p.406] What comes to mind when thinking about "pure" functions is the combinators invented by Moses Schönfinkel before Church's lambda-calculus. Combinatory logic is a computation model equal to the lambda calculus, but without lambda-abstraction, that is, no substitutions What combinatory logic does is the same as a basic term rewriting system. A reduction system. See the article in the on-line "Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy" "Combinatory Logic" But what also comes to mind is constructive or Martin-Löf type theory that is yet another alternative to the foundations of mathematics. Their are categorical models of type theory. One model is Local Cartesian Closed Categories or LCCC, Seely & refined by Hoffman & Cybjer. Also universal algebra (A.N. Whitehead) is very similar to category theory by creating algebraic structure of closed sets of operations and data. (What object oriented programming aspires to but doesn't know it except for the writers of Smalltalk and Java) If structuralism is to describe all such systems and mathematics itself, it needs formal definition. Piaget may have been off to a good start in this respect as what he describes is either automata or a cybernetic system. J. Richard Buchi says in "Finite Automata, Their Algebras and Grammars", Dirk Siefkes, ed that the theory of automata subsumes all algebraic systems including universal algebra so I assume category theory, too. That is we can write a categorical theoretic program in Haskell or SASL. (I've a book by M. Arbib "Arrows, Structures, and Functors: The Categorical Imperative" where, I think the subtitle is "Thinking in Arrows") There's a number of books on category theory that do not require a PhD in mathematics Here is another "Categories, Types and Structures: An Introduction to Category Theory for the Working Computer Scientist", Andrea Asperti and Giuseppe Longo, 1991 

It is a statue made out of platinum depicting a God and is accurate in every detail. The God is whole, nameless, universal, just, and divisible. It arose out of chaos and void in 1799 and is a God "for all people for all time." 

You would presumably need some sort of internal "evidence" to justify a "belief." But justifying a personal belief in God is not the same as making a truth claim upon the beliefs of others, so the "evidence" required is very different. In some branches of philosophy a validity claim must be grounded in a "true, justified belief," around which a great thicket of qualifiers, definitions, and controversies has arisen. In scientific matters or legal cases, "evidence" conforms to various formal specifications, the possibility of falsification or replication, and ultimately some formalized, yet conditional consensus. But these are cases of "public" evidence, "experiential" confirmation, aiming at consensus. No such evidence can be offered for the existence of God. The existence of sacred texts, the testimony of believers, or witness of "miracles," are not instances that can be readily falsified or confirmed by repetition and collective experience. A "miracle" as Hume notes, is precisely that event which cannot be repeated, demonstrated to others, and thus confirmed as a "law of nature." So if you ask what evidence "you" need to believe in God, the answer is simply anything that convinces you. An inner certainty, an answered prayer, a near death experience, an ontological argument, personal testimony of a loved one, a sense of dread, a startlingly apt line of sacred text, Pascal's wager, a warm feeling in the chest area, a lack of psychological alternatives. Anything could qualify as "evidence" for "your" belief in God. But "evidence" that compels agreement from others in the manner of mathematical proofs or scientific and legal evidence is notoriously lacking in the case of divinity. And is probably not applicable even in theory. I would add, however, that John Locke, the father of modern empiricism, considered the four separate eye-witness accounts of the Gospel as good as legal evidence gets. Further historical-linguistic evidence has superseded that happy opinion. Postscript. Since I am having trouble with "Comments" function, I'll respond here to a comment below. The "historical-linguistic evidence" is simply about the Gospels, which were not eye-witnesses, were not independent (three being traceable to "Source Q"), have proven inconsistent, and were selected from many contemporary apocrypha. None of which was known to Locke. What gives these research findings more weight than "someone's happy opinion," is simply the conventions and standards of "public" or "scientific" evidence discussed above. This may or may not have anything to do with those personal beliefs we may label "opinions" or with the "evidential" constitution of such beliefs. My point is that Locke's argument would can no longer qualify as valid "historical evidence," as it might have in his day. You seem to be equating "evidence" with "truth." The working conventions of public or scientific "evidence" are highly constrained, limited, and functional. One can argue about "absolute truth" or "God," making your case. But such arguments are simply misplaced in the laboratory or law courts with their widely adopted standards of public "evidence."
