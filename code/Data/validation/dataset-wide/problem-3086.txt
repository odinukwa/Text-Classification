I did not see a similar general note, so you can probably take this as more focusing on Thailand and Burma, where I could see such a public list would endanger those on it. Considering the list is in flux, and changing all the time, it'd be under constant revision especially since their definition of prisoner of conscience is both sort of flexible and not comprehensive since Amnesty International doesn't take all cases under consideration. 

When looking at the United States Declaration of Independence its easy to notice that John Hancock's signature is more prominent than the others: 

In the United States we received changes in the social safety net over the past century with the big changes coming in the form of social security and medicaid/medicate as well as other programs. The "Great Society" under the Johnson administration in the 1960's was the last big program change/introduction. Yet in early American society there was a lot of basis on self-sufficiency that often is touted as coming from the Protestant roots of many who came here. Somewhere along the way that self-sufficiency changed to where the government needed to step in and offer aid to many, including the poor, citizens of this country. In looking at our history we went in just over a hundred years from self-sufficiency and an expanding country to bread/soup lines in the Great Depresson. What precipitated this change? Was it industrialization? Social forces that changed in the late 19thC due to immigration? Were the uneven economic cycles of the 19thC a cause? I'm looking for historical root causes that would have allowed for a change in social norms to where it was ok for people to accept help from the government, rather than expect it to stay out of their way. 

Around the time of the American Civil War the land military (that is the Army) had its sympathies on the cause of the Confederacy, in my opinion, due to the make up of the military officers of the time being mostly from the American South. Many of the leaders and military commanders were from Southern states and their sympathies tended to be towards their home states. The US Navy around the same time must have had an officer core that came in a majority from somewhere, but I've not seen any written materials that have investigated this. What was the composition of the US Navy around this time? Were they in a majority from Northern states that already had a naval culture? Granted the US Navy was relatively small at this time but those people had to come from somewhere and I am interested in knowing where to sort of gauge where their sympathies might have lie. 

This seemed to have come from Persia's freedom from the Qajars and some nationalism on the part of Germany during WWII influencing the Shah's decisions. So it was originally changed in 1935 and not 1979, unless you are only referring to the Islamic Republic addition, which was done at the Ayatollah's will, more than likely. The name of the country in Persian apparently was Iran so this was a natural choice for their own name. You can find more here: Iran Heritage site on changing name to Iran 

Most of this came from class notes and one of our major texts: An Introduction to Islam by Frederick Mathewson Denny Hope that helps 

Washington DC was basically "made" the capital after Philadelphia after an insurrection by Revolutionary War soldiers called the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783. The mutiny showed that state governments could not protect federal institutions so there began a search to move the capital where it could be defended by the Federal government. There was a power struggle between what would be the "Southern" states and the "North" to move the capital somewhere symbolic, and to some in an area they could influence. As part of a deal negotiated by Alexander Hamiliton: 

Brown v Board of Education was the landmark Supreme Court case in America that was supposed to allow more educational choice for all Americans, basically stopping segregational policies and on a legal level schools were to be integrated. While the results did not go as planned the case itself was an amalgamation of other legal cases that made their way through the courts in the early/mid 20th century. Were there others that happened before this time in either the early 20thC or in the 19thC that might have been lost before this decision? Typcially it takes years and multiple tries to get a case to the Supreme Court so it seems that these cases can't be the only ones and so far I haven't found many more that might have been tried. More on Brown v Board of Education can be found here if needed. 

These should get you started, I'd recommend the Grasso, Corrin and Kort book only for its brief synopsis bits of many of the changes in China from the end of the Qing to modernization but I also had classes with Professor Corrin a few years ago so I am slightly biased there. The Changing Face of China might be more to your liking if you want to know about the modern attitudes and changes in China since 1949 and has some good detail on each stage of development and might be the style you want to read. They are not really history books but Red Azalea by Anchee Min and The Good Earth by Pearl S Buck are views on China that are more fictional, although Anchee Min's story is more about her life in China through the Cultural Revolution. Pearl S Buck is more about China at the end of the Qing and is considered a very good capture of Chinese culture from an outsider for the time. 

At some point it had to stop, although it seems as if Congress could change it again if they wanted to, so long as the apportionment stay as constitutionally derived. 

Here are some I can recommend, and I had a couple of these in my history classes so they might seem to be a bit more than you like but they are not bad reads even for non-history types. They are not difficult to get into even if you are not a historian, although modern Chinese history especially in the warlord era is complex so it does take a little bit of time to understand the complexities. 

I've often come across readings that mentioned there were numerous holidays in calendars in use within the Christian Churches or Church controlled lands, with work stopping on worship days, feast days and so on. While this opens a wide geographical area I am curious if there are any sources that note holidays within a typical year for a European-centric area (say current day France-Germany-Italy) between the 11th-13th Centuries. What holidays were there and were these religious (feast or sanctified days) or were there celebrations for any other purpose (such as we have for memorial days within many current calendars). 

You could look at the diaries of the colonists of the time, such as Anne Hutchinson who was captured by Native Americans, or John Winthrop and see what they note about the natives at the time. The problem with many of the tribes in the Massachusetts Bay area is that many were displaced by the Bay Colony and from diseases that were rampant up and down the New England coast. Many tribes did not leave much in the area, and other than Connecticut and Maine you won't find any major areas held by Native American Tribes. There are small tribe holdings in the other New England states but not very significant and not much in the way of museums, but you can check locally or go to the tribes and try to talk to leaders. You can check diaries of the Plimouth Plantation founders and anyone who fought in King Philip's War, as well as the local villages as noted previously to find out more. While most of this is after contact, the written word from the tribes is lacking from the time, since most had oral histories. So anything that might be put down would be from the Europeans. 

I believe this was to make the local State laws, that were a hodgepodge of enactments on a State level, more uniform and to bring the enforcement into the Federal realm. This was especially easy since the Temperance Movements had become politically powerful in the early 20th Century and in the election of 1917 the pro-Prohibitionists finally had a majority in Congress and moved things along. The actual text is: 

To give a little more depth from what TED notes, this did take shape over time and was based on Zionism and how it was being viewed by the British at the time. There were also competing interests that eventually collided as time wen on. When the Ottoman empire entered on the side of the Germany this prompted Britain, France and Russia to partition the Ottoman territories in the event of an Allied victory. The British pledge to Sharif Husayn of Mecca and the Sykes-Picot Agreement between Britain and France were two of the principal proposals for territorial division. The Balfour Declaration was another, yet it was met with suspicion by France and Sharif Husayn as contravening the agreements Britain had already made. During WWI it was widely believed by many within the British government that Jewish groups held an unusual amount of power within the Russian and American governments. This might affect Russian and US involvement in the war and until the American declaration came it was thought that Germany might make a declaration of support for Zionism and then America might enter on the side against Britain. With Russia being unstable it was thought that it too might be swayed by any German sympathy towards Zionism. So it was thought that British interests would be served by gestures of goodwill towards the Zionists, Chaim Weizmann was the spokesman in London during this period and was a significant policymaker, he was also a very charismatic spokesman and had many ties within the British government. He kept the idea alive about a Jewish Homeland in Palestine, it should be noted that what the Jews thought of as a homeland and what the British considered it as became the main point of contention later on. British strategic interests in the Middle East were helped out by promoting the Zionist cause, this gave them an ally in the area and would also keep out France. The Balfour declaration gave the British support for Zionism, yet it was ambiguous and contradictory enough that later on this would be hard to implement and was chiefly a failure as the competing interests noted here did not get what they wanted. The idea that you could grant a Jewish state and provide for the continual rights of the non-Jews in the area was not possible as written. When the British captured Jerusalem in December 1917 this allowed for the British military occupation of Palestine and it was then that the British tried to reconcile Zionism and Arabism by getting Weizmann and Faysal of Syria to negotiate. They did agree to cooperation between the Jews and the Arabs so that Jewish communities would cooperate with the Arabs and Faysal would recognize the Balfour Declaration and consent to Jewish immigration so long as the rights of Palestinian Arabs were protected and Greater Syria was independent. Faysal did not agree to a Jewish state though, this becomes important later on. Although, once the French took Syria these agreements became null and void. The main point became the idea of a Jewish national home, Weizmann was sure what it meant as a spokesman for Zionism, he had stated at the Paris Peace Conference that the Zionist objective was to make Palestine as Jewish as England was English. The Zionists expected the British to go along with this idea, Britain did not and within the Balfour Declaration had noted that they wanted to protect Palestinian Arab rights as well. It was the idea of equal obligation and the unsolvable contradiction to the Balfour Declaration. The British tried to clarify itself in the 1922 White Paper, and within there noted that a Jewish nation home did not mean imposition of a Jewish nationality on all of Palestine. It did note that Jews had a right to be in Palestine and that it should become a place where the Jews could go. Yet the British High Commissioner tried to balance the Zionist aims and the freedoms of the Palestinian Arabs, yet failed and it was through this that the Jews and Arabs became hostile to each other. This was exacerbated once Jewish immigration raised the population representational ratios from about 82-16 Arab-Jewish in 1931 to 67-31 Arab-Jewish in 1946. Land was bought by the Jews from absentee Arab landlords such that the Arab tenant farmers were evicted, which began a cycle where Arabs were becoming economically depressed (considering this was the 1930's) and began having to sell land, which increased Jewish land ownership. This also dispossessed the Arabs where they considered themselves as unrepresented from their own leaders, the British were seen as not being willing to intervene and the Zionists they considered as the cause. With this antagonism building due to immigration and land purchases, tensions rose and the Arabs protested with acts of violence with the Wailing Wall disturbance of 1929 and revolts within 1936-1939. This is when the British responded by first the Shaw Commission which noted that Arab rights were not being protected as per the Balfour Agreement and that Jewish immigration needed to be put under British control, instead of following these recommendations the British then sent the Hope-Simpson Commission and their recommendations were put into the Passfield White Paper which finally stressed British obligations to Arabs and Jews and it was a recommendation here that Jewish immigration needed to be restricted due to the limited economic capacity of Palestine. Sorry for the long background, but this is a complex situation that took time to build up, and although this was eventually overturned by Weizmann and members of the British and US governments it was at least a point where the British really tried to clear up their own inconsistencies and policies in the region. My main source for this was A History of the Modern Middle East by William Cleveland and Martin Bunton, we used this text in my Modern Middle East History class and it is very thorough on this situation.
