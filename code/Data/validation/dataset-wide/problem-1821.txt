Not sure what your budget is, but globalscape works pretty well. It also allows for upload/download via a web interface OR using a client. 

Get the Serial number for the server, find the manual online and see what the beeping could indicate. Look to see if there is a LED panel. Usually beepings are with LED alerts. Or any Hard Drives have Lights. 

My assumption is that you were looking at something like Cricket or Cacti. Both of those (like MRTG) can look at the SNMP counters and record graphs of usage. Very awesome and powerful stuff. I have added links to a couple VMApps that have Cacti bundled in. NOTE I have not used either of these VMapps but one is recommended by www.petri.co.il, always a good site. 

I've been using the Striving Life website for his IIS FTP LogParser 2.2 queries. My only issue is that I can't seem to combine the two queries that bring back both successful login AND their account name. Can anyone help? 

The error tells you - you have no A records for your name servers. This means you are probably hosting your own primary and secondary name servers, so you'll need glue records as well. 

The "milter service" is a pass-off from Postfix to run messages through an anti-spam (spamassassin) or anti-virus (amavis, etc) scanner before sending out and/or delivering to Dovecot/etc. to be sent ot a users in-box. That "can't connect" message means that your milter service is either not running or it isn't running on the port that you've specified. Check in your to see exactly what the milter service is supposed to be providing, and then look at the configuration for that thing. Or just post your file (properly formatted please) 

You are setting it inside the loop, so it will keep prompting you for it. I would have two loops - one to prompt for the server name and keep prompting until a valid value is provided, and then one to do option A or B or Quit. For pure programming questions like this, you may be better off asking on stackexchange 

I will preface this, with the truth that I know little about Macs :-) I am trying to workout a way to block application installations (or executions) on Macs. We have a subset of executive users (meaning they "need" root on the box) who have Macs. However, the are installing applications like Skpe, that break our Corporate Policies. Does anyone know of a software to manage this? Preferably Open Source. 

This could be a multitude of failed things. Memory, CPU bank, PSU, Hard Driveor FAN. My guess is on the PSU or fan. The options are these: 

After saying all this, and realizing that IceMage said most of this as well... know that if the server is still working, it probably is just in a degraded state. Open a ticket or Email your server support team so it is documented, then personally talk to the Server Admin. 

I don't collect form info, etc. on my sites, but I do want everything to run HTTPS so I set up vhost configs to redirect non-HTTPS requests to the HTTPS side, with a non-named catch-all that redirects to example1.com - 

Running the should return a error. However, some ISPs will return the IP of an ad server, a search server, etc. instead of a proper NXDOMAIN. What service provider are you using? What DNS servers are you using? What happens if you use a known-NX-issuing server for DNS requests? I'll bet that if you try (ie, ask Google's public server about $URL$ you'll get a proper NXDOMAIN return. 

The premise in your edit note is wrong. The MX protocol/decision tree/whatever is designed to handle this. 

I have a similar working set up - I'm not using DKIM or DMARC, just SPF for spam fighting. Here's mine - I set mine up using this as a guide and while I follow it 90% of the way there are a few things I do differently - $URL$ Here's what is in my various files for hostnames. Like you, I'm hosting multiple domains and they all work fine. Reverse DNS is set to I get a letsencrypt cert via the standalone method, and specify example.com, mail.example.com, and www.example.com as hosts on it. - ( w/ appropriate mapping to 127.0.0.1 in ) - In I have the following references to hostnames or FQDNs - 

Possibly look at having the cronjob output an error code to a log, ahve nagios look at the log. If the cronjob reports an error, than boom. Or, a little easier but less precise, have the last line of your cronjob script write to a log file. Have nagios check for the modification date of the log file. If it goes more than 25 hours, kick off an alret. 

Short of a tool like SCCM you are not going to be able to discover an exact listing of machines on the network. First task will be finding the hosts: 

If you can use a startup script in a GPO this is easy If not, then if you are not too skillful with scripting, I would do a laymans approach. First use a tool like angryIP to get a listing of all of the windows desktops you want to modify the tool with 

Since these are already logged in ufw.log how can i stop them from appearing at kern.log and syslog ? Is there something I must do to prevent these attacks or is this normal for a server to experience? 

Using Wordpress on Nginx. I am receiving these errors but I can't seem to find out where in my Nginx options I have specified this 'DENY' header. 

Running a public wordpress site and every few minutes I am seeing these kind of entries on my syslog on my ubuntu server. (I have hidden my mac/ip address in the logs below) What is happening here? 

is there a similar rule to rewrite the FROM name ? UPDATE After reading the postfix manual, it is desirable not to alter the message headers. However, how can I tell postfix not to write any message headers and use whatever names i have set up in Google Aps ? 

This question really depends upon the individuality of your hosts. If you can get all of our hosts to a nice little standard, you can really work some magic with templates. Personally I find that it works for only the very basics (for example, Mem/Proc/Services on windows) Then it starts getting harder (one server has a File system that needs to have alerts sent to a production support group for space size violations, but it also has other File Systems that need to go to the development support group. And oh by the way, this server has unique drives because it was bought on a golf and shop trip by your boss) Personally I used a combination of Nagios 2.0 and 3.0, with a mix of Host groups. I separate hosts out into OS grouped configs (windows with windows, Solaris with Solaris, Linux with Linux). Then I break out the core checks into a core_checks.cfg (Memory, Processor, essential process checks) then I break the services that I monitor down into different config files (Oracle Database checks, My Sql Datbase checks, Very Specific File system checks, Website checks). This lets me have my config files organized logically for myself and anyone who comes after me. Note I do have 4400 checks these days so this might be overkill for other people. In the long run, I have a structure something like this nagios\etc\core_checks.cfg nagios\etc\hosts\windows_servers.cfg,solaris_servers.cfg nagios\etc\services\oracle_databases.cfg,MSSQL_databases.cfg 

Clients connect to for Submission (w/ TLS/SSL) and pop3 and/or imap (both with tls/ssl). Works great. 

First issue is did something change on your end ? No longer listening on your LAN address and only on localhost, etc. New firewall policy being pushed down by domain controller/etc? Then you would be looking at addressing. Does yourcomputername.company.com still resolve to the address your computer actually has? Does it resolve that way on other computers? IE, things could be great BUT that name is resolving to the wrong address... Errors would be "can't find server named ..." or "dns resolution" if the name isn't look-up-able at all and you'd need to check what address it does resolve to separately... Last check is routing. Many sub-netted networks do not allow packets to travel between "client" subnets, only from client to "server" subnets and then out to the world. Can someone on the same subnet connect to you? Can you connect to others on other subnets? Routing issues typically give a different error message (no route to host) 

Splunk!!!! Splunk!!! Splunk!!!! I use it for a mix of Networking devices, Linux, Solaris, Windows. The only issue is to keep under the free level, you need to be very specific what logs you want to keep, but I found as long as I was diligent in cutting down on chatter, and really only logging the info I needed, I had no problem. $URL$ 

All, we are working creating a shared secret library in Sharepoint. basically the idea being, a user fills out a "Shared Secret" infopath form (AKA "What is your highschool mascot") and then that form is sent to a secure library that only the helpdesk can read. Currently it looks like our sharepoint admin doesn't know how to create a secured library. Has anyone done anything similar in sharepoint? Or does anyone know of some good tutorials for creating something like this? 

This will give you 2 sets of certs, under the directories. When you create your vhost configs, instead of specifying the use the actual IP of the host and point to the appropriate certificate files. 

Create a new group, put the www-data user and your trusted dev(s) (ie, you or whovever else), set perms and ownership appropriately. Freelancer could still write code that could fopen() the files (and then display in his browser, whatever) though since the www-data user needs to be able to read the files... If www-data doesn't need to read the files, they don't belong in the webspace. 

If your friend wants you to do his DNS for him, all he has to do is enter ns1/ns2.yourdomain.com for his name servers with his registrar. You need to set up a zone file as appropriate for him, with A records, MX record(s), SPF/TXT records, etc. If you want to delegate a subdomain to him, you need to do some things on your end, then some things on his end, and then he'll have a subdomain of yours with a working name server. Note that I've not tested this subdomain name server as a NS entry in a domain registry for a 3rd domain, but it should work. First, on your domain, create the subdomain in the zone file.
