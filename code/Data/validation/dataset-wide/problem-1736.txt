Other than memory size limits of 4GB, what is the penalty for running 32 bit applications on an OS running in 64 bit? For example. does a 32 bit application require that it's address space be allocated within the first 4 GB or does the OS and processor abstract this away from the application? There has been a lot of push for 64 bit applications in the software community where I don't always foresee the applications requiring such a large amount of memory (e.g, Firefox), so I'm just curious of the benefits and pitfalls of running 32 bit applications on a 64 bit platform. 

I just installed IE 8 and I am now unable to authenticate with my SharePoint 2007 site using Integrated Authentication. I have no problems, however, connecting with Firefox using the exact same user account. Thinking my problem might be related to IE 8 permissions, I added the site to the list of intranet sites. After this did not resolve the problem, I also reconfigured the security level to low for the intranet zone. I'm still unable to authenticate. Interestingly enough, I'm able to connect to the Central Admin site using the same browser. Furthermore, as I previously mentioned, I have no problem connecting using Firefox. Both Central Admin and my development site are configured for Integrated Windows Authentication in IIS. I've gone through the advanced settings in IE one-by-one and I haven't been able to figure out what's preventing me from authenticating with my SharePoint site using IE 8. I thank you in advance for any information. 

So I'm a little taken back by this. I have gone through all the sites and cannot see anything that would indicate a site has been compromised, or that anyone has compromised the server? Could this be just a mistake or someone has masked their own IP address and used my servers? Any other ideas or tools that I could use to investigate this further to see if there has been a compromise? Any help appreciated. Thanks. 

I have an EC2 server (Win2008) which has about 10 sites on it, it's completely locked down apart from ports 80 and 443. I can only access port 3389 and 21 from my home and work IP addresses. Just now I received the following from Amazon: 

For all the databases on the server. Its doing this more or less every hour? Is that right? I assumed once the database had started thats it unless I restart the SQL service or shut down the server? Any advice appreciated - Thanks. 

And restarted IIS, but nothing changed. It's still blocking Dots in paths. And then I restarted the entire server... And guess what. It's still blocking dots in path? I have no idea what to do next, apart from un-install it? Anyone else this issue? 

I have a web server that I run which has quite a few sites on it now all using SQL Db's - Its actually a cloud server from 1&1 (Win2008). I have the following in place in case of the worst: 

I'm trying to configure a web service that queries a SharePoint list. The web service should allow anonymous access from clients. What I'm observing is puzzling me, however. Following is a high level overview of my environment: web service client -> web service -> SharePoint What I'm finding is that the user running the web service client requires access to SharePoint. In other words, the user credentials are being passed from the client, through the web service layer, all the way into SharePoint. What I would prefer is that only the web service application pool identity account be granted permission. After disabling Integrated Security, while enabling only Anonymous Access in the web service IIS configuration settings, a 401 (authentication denied) exception is thrown. I have verified that the application pool identity account has permission to the SharePoint site. I have also verified that the authentication mode is configured as "windows" in the web.config file. I'm not using impersonation, anywhere. Please note that this is a custom web service (not using the built in SharePoint web services), hosted in IIS 6.0 on Windows Server 2003. EDIT: I have additional web methods exposed on the web service that do not connect to SharePoint. I have no problem calling those web methods. Additionally, I have verified that the client user is being passed through to SharePoint because I had to grant the user (the person running client) access to SharePoint. 

Found the answer if anyone is interested, here it is. Turns out the instructions I received from my predecessor were missing a key command which needs to be run after the transport file is updated. 

I'm working with postfix on fedora 9 and I'm attempting to make some changes to a system setup by my predecessor. Currently the postfix server on [mail.ourdomain.com] is setup to forward mail sent to two addresses to another server for processing. The other server [www01.ourdomain.com] receives the email and sends it to a PHP script to be processed. Then that PHP script generates and sends a response to the user who sent the original email. We're adding more web servers to the system and as a result we've decided to move these processing scripts to our admin [admin.ourdomain.com] server to make them easier to keep track of. I've already setup and tested the processing scripts on [admin.ourdomain.com], and on the mail server doing the forwarding [mail.ourdomain.com] I added [admin.ourdomain.com] to /etc/hosts and also added another, aside from the one for [www01.ourdomain.com], entry to /etc/postfix/transport for [admin.ourdomain.com]. I also restarted postfix as well. I've tested the communication from [mail.ourdomain.com] to [admin.ourdomain.com] using telnet and the [admin.ourdomain.com] domain and everything runs correctly. But as soon as I change the forward address and attempt to send an email to the mail server I get a bounce message stating "Host or domain name not found. Name service error for name=admin.ourdomain.com type=A: Host not found". If I change the forward settings back to [www01.ourdomain.com] then everything works fine. Is there some setting I'm missing in Postfix? The server itself and telnet work fine it just seems to be postfix that's not able to discover the location of [admin.ourdomain.com].
