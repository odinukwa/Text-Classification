It could be that all they are doing is rotating the pedals - not because they have to input any force to make the bike go but because the motor will not run with receiving a continuous signal from a hall-effect switch coupled to the pedals. Thus the motor is enough to move the rider alone, but unless the rider is also rotating the pedals a cadence sensor as "safety feature", legislated in some areas, will detect that the rider is no longer rotating the pedals and will cut off the motor. This is not a torque sensor, a much more expensive device. 

I have a bike with Alfine 11 and belt drive. I think I could use a 175mm crank, certainly a 172.5, rather than the 170 Alfine comes in (height 6'1" frame size 60cm) and going a little lighter and prettier with Ultegra or Dura Ace appeals to me. All are two-piece chainsets compatible with the Hollowtech II bottom bracket. All have 130 BCD. Seems like a straight swap is possible. The only thing I can thing of that might go wrong is belt alignment - is the offset of the larger chainring mounts on the road sets going to be the same as the mounts on the Alfine? I was able to find that the quoted chainline for the Alfine chainset is 42.7mm - I can't find that figure for the other options. new information: Gates produce a bunch of shims and spacers - mentioned in the engineering manual but I haven't been able to find them for sale anywhere. It looks like with this kit an Ultegra chainset will work but it's an expensive experiment without knowing for sure. I'll have to email Gates to try and find the kit, then buy the chain set if the rings look like they will correct the chainline - which from all information must be as perfect as possible. 

It was the seal on the Alfine Hub leaking. The local service agents for Spot were able to correct the leak by tightening the external seal on the hub and cleaning everything around it. No cost. The hub is currently performing well. I'm as worried about it as I was when I made the decision to buy it, a new model of anything so complicated is likely to have these issues. But credit is due; it has stayed smooth and quiet after many rides through rain & grit where I would have been disassembling and cleaning a cassette & derailleur. update: see main article. Hub is currently leaking not in use. 

I have a Gates belt drive. After getting tension right (using the iPhone app) initially I did not touch it for a year and was surprised to find it had not changed. For me at least, no stretch. 

An old shallow cooking tray full of petrol. Disassemble the derailleur, put all the parts in the petrol as you go. Pick them up one by one and scrub with an old toothbrush until clean, put each clean part on a paper towel to drain/evaporate. Then pick up each part and rub it with a dry paper towel before putting it down on a clean surface. Finally reassemble with correct lubrication - which is different for different areas of different parts. You probably want two or three basic lubricants like chain oil, light machine oil and a lightweight grease. Don't smoke while you do this, or use litres of petrol at once. Do it outdoors and don't be leaning right over the tray breathing fumes. I find ordinary petrol a lot easier on the hands than any of the citrus-smelling solvents which do tend to strip all the oils out of your hands. A super-aggressive solvent isn't necessary. The key is disassembly! You cannot get these small complicated units really clean without it. Squirting stuff into friction points, soaking or whatever else does not always flush grit, old grease or grime out it can just drive it further in. Not to mention your increased understanding of how the thing works when it comes time to adjust, assess wear or evaluate a new one. 

They have a steel foot plate and a pressure gauge. The rubber hose should be secured with clips rather than glued or molded in so that if you need to you can replace it - this is a good sign the manufacturer expects the pump to last longer than its hose. This sounds like a dinosaur, something like your grandfather might have tucked in the back of the shed, but I bought mine only about 15 years ago. I don't think I'll ever need another one. It has handled road, MTB and kids bikes (very different capacity and pressure requirements). The brand is Silca but others must make a non-plastic pump. 

The best floor pumps have a steel tube, a steel shaft and a wooden handle. They have a heavy brass attachment at the hose end without levers or locks, push-on for Presta (a locking mechanism is not necessary to attach to a Presta valve, the fitting just needs to be well made and have the appropriate rubber seal) or remove the Presta part and screw-on for Schrader. This is what it looks like - apparently it is called a sometimes. 

Looking into an IGH it seems the biggest disadvantage is having a huge amount of rotating mass. I've seen one handmade bike where the IGH sits above the bracket, inside a carbon fibre shroud around the place some bikes have rear suspension. There are two chains, one driving the IGH and another to drive the rear wheel. Why not have an internally geared bottom bracket where the cranks drive the input shaft and the crank ring rotates at a ratio selectable by the gear lever? Then the rear wheel could have a single drive wheel driven by a chain or belt and a lightweight hub just solid enough to mount the spokes and disc. Then you could have mud-free gearing while reducing rotating mass even below what you have with a conventional cassette... and given that you have thrown out the bottom bracket the overall weight gain would be less. Quite a job for the home builder to adapt an existing hub I guess but it should be possible. 

I have a 2012 Spot Acme and it's been great, everything is still smooth and working well into its second winter. However I picked it up to bring it into the office a week ago and noticed grease all over my hands, just like a chain would do. Here's a picture. 

I bought "powder coated" nipples for a new build to match a frame. It's for a SOMA Wolverine and the wheels were to be black spoke & rim with orange nipples - all the other non-orange parts are black so I'm looking to complete the overall effect. The color is a good match. However the "powder coating" comes off as easily as dried acrylic house paint from chrome. With normal use of a spoke wrench (for example Park Tool SW-22.2) the coating is peeling away as soon as the wrench is removed, around the holes in the rim it's a similar story even though the heads and threads of the nipples are lubricated. Part of the problem is that the "powder coating" is very thick on some nipples, thin enough not to affect the fit of the wrench on others. The story from the seller - Newson Sportec (select "PC Orange" if you want to see a nipple photo) - is that these nipples can only be tightened from the rear, i.e. by screwdriver. Of course that information only comes after lacing up the wheel and finding that the paint is falling off, turning what should have been a perfect new wheel into a mess. If you're an experienced wheel builder, have you ever build a wheel without a spoke wrench, do you think it is possible to build a correctly tensioned wheel using only the slot? My thought is spoke rotation would be far harder to observe and with the wheel in a rotating truing stand it would be almost impossible to keep the driver engaged with the slot. And then the spokes would have to be exactly the right length or else they would protrude from the back of the spoke, disengaging the driver - as a Nipple Driver (e.g. Park Tool ND-1) is designed to be disengaged. Or be too short and not grab enough thread. If you haven't built a wheel - ever come across "powder coating" soft as butter? edit: Part of the problem might be that the brass nipples have been plated in what looks like chrome before the "powder coating" was applied. I suspect plain brass, even without any preparation of the surface, would have been a much better base for the color. Anyway they are removed and binned now.
