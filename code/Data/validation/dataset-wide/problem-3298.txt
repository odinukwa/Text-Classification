I think you are mixing different things. One is that a stratified society has different degrees of formal education for different people. There consequently is a tendency for the upper layers of such society to speak a different "sociolect" than the lower layers. The other is that people speak in different registers in different contexts. Anyone, from a beggar to a Supreme Court justice, speaks differently when in court than when among friends in an informal context. Applying this to your specific question about pronouns, those things may or may not relate. Taking Portuguese as an example, let's imagine a dialogue between beggar and judge. In court, it should go more or less like this: 

In any place where regional origin is associated with lower social status (basically, where internal migration in search of jobs and wages is/was important, or where a central political authority was recently imposed into a periphery) we will find such phenomenon. Some from Brazilian Portuguese: "ti" pronounced /θi/ instead of /t͡ʃi/ (very much the same as in your example, btw, except that both pronouciations only exist before /i/) shows a Northeastern (more specifically, Recife-an) pronounciation; as there was intense migration from the drough-afflicted Northeast to more economically dynamical Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, which lead to a significant part of the working class in these cities being of Northeastern origin, and so to speak like this, it resulted in the pronounciation being stigmatised. Non-stressed "e" pronounced as /ɛ/ instead of /e/, involving the same regions and "logic" as the previous; Post-vocalic "r" pronounced as a retroflex is characteristic of the hinterland of São Paulo. As there is always migration from the countryside to the capital, and the rural areas have a low prestige, again this pronounciation is stigmatised. Final "e" pronounced as /e/ instead of reduced to /i/ is similarly characteristic of rural Rio Grande do Sul, and as such stigmatised in a similar way (though in this case, due to the importance of the rural area in the identitary mythology of gaúchos, it gets more complicated, the pronounciation being derided by inhabitants of Porto Alegre when uttered by migrants from the countryside, but upheld as a source of pride against people of the centre of the country). 

Well, what are the other options? I suppose we could call it a "letterlist", "letterset", "letrarium", because this is what an alphabet is. But those somehow miss an important feature of alphabets, ie, that they are not a mere collection of letters, but an organised one, that contains all letters in a fixed ("alphabetic") order. We could also give it a more poetical neologism, such as "wisdomkey" or "knowledgedoor", but perhaps those feel too much as figurative language. Other option is to do like we do, and use a word derived from Greek (or other ancient language of culture), such as alphabet, nevermind the fact that we no longer have letters called "alpha" or "beta". But that will have to fight for its space in colloquial language against "ABC" (in Portuguese, abecedário), even if it reigns supreme in the standard. Naming it for its first letters seems to be a good idea, because, besides giving it a name, it already helps to memorise the correct order. It is a name, and a mnemonic too, as a bonus. Others mentioned the way it is taught; it is an immensely repetitive process, probably only made tolerable by the use of songs. The repetition probably helps fixing the name; I can't help but imagining schoolkids whispering to each others, "oh no! there comes the old ABC thing again!" (As a side note - we do not have a word for the ordered list of numerals - why not?) 

There are two reasons, I think, why English speakers respect the Italian pronunciation of pizza(1) but mangle that of tagliatelle. First, as it has been mentioned, all the phonemes, and combinations of phonemes, in pizza exist in English. But the phoneme that Italian graphs as "gl" (/ʎ/) doesn't exist in English, or exists as a mere alophone of /l/, as in some pronunciatioms of "million". But this, by itself, shouldn't have precluded a closer aproximation of the Italian pronounce of tagliatelle, such as pronouncing the "gl" as /l/ or /j/. So, second, there are words that are borrowed in an oral context, and words that are borrowed in a literary context. The former tend to emulate the pronounce of the word in its original language, as close as the phonetic system of the borrowing language permits. The later tend to be pronunciated as required by the ortographic rules of the borrowing language. It seems to me that pizza has been imported into English from its spoken form, while tagliatelle has been imported in its written form. (1) Mostly; the Italian pronunciation of pizza, if I am not mistaken, is /'pit.sa/ rather than /'pit.sə/. 

Do sign languages have "accents" like verbal languages? If so, what would be some examples of those? 

No. It is possible for an affix to become a root, as in the mentioned case of super, and then to derive new words by attaching prefixes and/or suffixes to it, but that's a different case. 

Common origin gives us series of related words. For instance, English "father" and Latin "pater" have a common origin. But then we have a whole series of words that have a similar fonetic structure in Germanic languages and other Indo-European languages, particularly featuring the peculiarity that what begins in "f" in Germanic languages begins in "p" in non-Germanic languages, and what sounds as "th" in English sounds as t in other languages. So we have, father (English) - Vater (German) - pater (Latin) mother (English) - mater (Latin) fish (English) - Fisch (German) - pisces (Latin) foot (English) - Fuss (German) - podos (Greek) feather (English) - pteros (Greek) When we do not have those series, then a common origin cannot be established. In the particular case you cite, we do not have any consistent series of words in which Turkish initial /b/ corresponds to Latin initial /m/, nor Turkish final /n/ to Latin final /l/. This means that the similarity is very probably - quite certainly, indeed - not due to a common origin (or is rooted in a common origin so ancient that it has left no real trace in either language). This leaves us with the hypotheses of 2. loans, and 3. coincidence. In the cases you bring into our attention, a loan is also quite unlikely. Words for "language" are quite central vocabulary in any language, which will not have much reason to borrow it. You borrow words like "spaghetti", that denote objects that you didn't know previously to an inter-cultural contact; and if you borrow a word like "language", it usually is an erudite borrowing, to establish a more refined/abstract connotation than the original "tongue". Neither Latin nor Turkish seem to have any problems with /b/ or /m/, so if they had borrowed from each other, both words would start with /b/ or both words would start with /m/. So, the most likely is that this is a coincidence, that you notice because of the similarity in meaning. But similarity in meaning is elusive; in the examples above I cited "feather" and "pteros" as related words - which they are, albeit their meaning being quite different. If there isn't historic evidence of a borrowing, or comparable series of words that can establish a common origin, coincidence is by far the most likely explanation for such irregular similarities. 

Nurture vs nature have crisscrossed with discrimination basically by radicalising discrimination into attempts of extermination when the discriminating party believed that the traits they discriminated against were genetic, ie, based on nature, not nurture. There certainly has been discrimination against languages along history, and there certainly were historical attempts to eradicate languages. But I don't think that there was any attempt to exterminate the speakers of a language, purely based on the fact that they spoke that language, and, that language being "inferior" or noxious, plus the speakers being somehow genetically bound to that language, they should or could be exterminated. On the contrary, the deliberate attempts to eradicate languages seem to have all been based on the notion that languages are learned - and were undertaken exactly by the method of teaching the preferred language to the discriminated language speakers, or to their children. In Europe, the attempts to eradicate languages - Breton in France, Galician, Basque and Catalan in Spain, several dialects in Italy, perhaps Welsh in the UK - seemed much more based upon the idea of imposing linguistic uniformity upon the territory controlled by a State, not so much upon the idea that the targeted language was "inferior". When Europeans did that abroad, the notion that native languages were "inferior" was much more publicised (just look at how those languages are pictured in Western comics, for instance the quite notorious The Phantom), but even there the main effort seems to have been to teach the natives a European language, not to deliberately kill them for the sake of it (nevermind brutal exploitation - and political repression intended to support such exploitation - having quite genocidal effects during the colonial era). Nowadays, however, the "nature vs nurture in languages" debate seems to focus not on whether we are hardwired to a given language, but whether we are hardwired for language in general. It seems well established that all people can learn any language, and that their first language will be determined by the language spoken around them during their early childhood, not by any innate factor. It seems also well established, at least in an academic level, that languages are similarly complex in syntax, no thing such as a "primitive" language actually existing, and, regarding morphology, the correlation is inverse, ie, languages of more simple societies have a more, not less, complex morphology. Within that frame, it would be difficult to effectively use the "nature" side of this debate to oppress or discriminate people. Linguistic prejudice, which is far from rare, usually takes for granted that "bad" language is the result of a defective education - and it is that defective education that is discriminated against. (But then there is this quite extraordinary thing with the Pirahã language, which supposedly has no embedded clauses, and makes its first-language speakers unable to grasp the concept of numbers. If the Pirahã were millions of people, and effectively engaged in the process of production of commodities, instead of a few thousand hunter-gatherers - or, on the contrary, if they were somehow harming the prospects of economic exploitation of the region they live in - I would fear those notions could be used as a tool against them.) 

As StoneyB says, the idea that adverbs "modify" verbs is characteristic of traditional grammar. More generally, traditional grammar tends to get syntax and semantics entangled, which doesn't really help in understanding what words in general - and adverbs in particular - do in the sentences they take part in. A better, and more modern, approach would be to investigate the syntatic behaviour of words: "Yesterday", as many other "adverbs", behaves very differently from, for intance, "quite": 

Spanish Alemaña (as well as French Allemagne and Portuguese Alemanha) derives from Latin Alemannia, which in turn comes from Alemanni, which was a confederation of German tribes. The Online Etymological dictionary says this comes from Proto-Germanic Alamanniz, which possibly meant "all men" (which makes sence, since they were a confederation); an alternative would be "other men", from Latin alius and Proto-Germanic manniz. It could also be that the Spanish word is a borrowing from French, as it was among the Franks that Allemand first became a term for all "Germans". In this case the etymology of the Spanish word would be more complicated: Proto-Germanic -> Latin -> Frankish -> Old French -> Spanish. The Arabic word must have been borrowed from Spanish, and the Turkish word would then be a borrowing from Arabic. 

It is difficult to distinguish those things, even in one's first language. In a second language, it becomes almost impossible (so, rule of thumb, when speaking/writing a second language, it is best to err in the conservative side). Hope this helps. 

Portuguese doesn't have a case system. Neither has Spanish, or French, Catalan, or Italian. A case system means that nouns (and possibly adjectives) take different forms for different grammatical functions. For instance, Latin has cases. The noun homo (man) has different forms whether it is a subject, object, vocative, etc. For instance: 

This doesn't make any sence to me. First, italics are definitely a graphic resource, and I am not sure there is any kind of oral correspondence (people use more intensity to orally express what is graphically represented by bold, or a lower tone to express parenthetic remarks (like this), but I am not aware of anything comparable regarding italics - people are more likely to use gestures, such as gestual "quote marks"). But the problem is even deeper. Italics are used to highlight some part of the text; if you use italics as a rule, then you are not highlighting anything; you would rather be using a different font than really italicising. So even if it was possible to define some oral resource that substitutes for italics in spoken language, it would make little sence to say that a person speaks "in italics". 

The Online Etymology Dictionary cites authors that believe it is not a cognate with Greek pathos, but a borrowing from Iranian, probably via Scythian. But they seem skeptic of this, and say that the initial /p/ is "a puzzle". 

I am not sure about English, but in Latin the phenomenon might be part of a much wider set of grammatical changes. Latin had three genders, but Romance languages typically have only two. What happened is that the Latin masculine and neutral genders collapsed into a single gender, which is called "masculine" in Romance languages. This collapse is related to similarities between masculine and neutral words, which were intensified by the drop of final consonants in the evolution of Classical Latin into Vulgar Latin. So in this case it was quite probably more of an issue of phonology and its impacts on the grammatical structure of the language than an ideological one. 

Though, as in the last sentence of the example, they seem to have peculiar issues with commas - and with verbal tenses, as shown below: 

(edit) Indeed, it could be said that Machhapuchare is too close to Machu Picchu for any actual relation to be possible. Portuguese and Latin are separated by 1,500 years, during which /genukulum/ became /ʒueʎu/ in Modern Portuguese (and only morphing into /ʒenukulum/ into Ecclesiastic Latin, because it is practically a congealed, written-only language). Tibetan and Andean languages are separated by at least a tenfold lapse of time, during which both, being non-written languages for the most part of the time, must have changed much more wildly. There is no way that any word would be recognisable after so long. It must be a coincidence, or either a loan - but then we would have to demonstrate that there was contact via Bhering or via Polinesian islands, which is contrary to known facts (and is unlikely since there are several unrelated languages geographically in-between, such as Eskimo-Aleut and Uto-Aztecan, or Polinesian). 

"Proposition" is a category in logic, not in grammar. A proposition is a statement about the state of affairs of the world, and it can be true or false. In your example, "I have a car" is a proposition. Notice that it is the same proposition as "Tiengo un coche", "J'ai un auto", "Tenho um carro", etc, though those are evidently different sentences or utterances. "Sentence" is a category in grammar, not in logic. It is a complete meaningful utterance. "I have a car" is a sentence as much as a proposition, and it may be said that all propositions must be a grammatical sentence. But the opposite is not true; for instance "Do I have a car?" is a sentence, but not a proposition. Notice that "I have a car" and "I own a car" are the same proposition, but different sentences. "Utterance" is any group of words that convey some meaning, even if it is anaphoric (like "yes" in your example). So all sentences are utterances, but not all utterances are sentences, because they may lack the grammatical structure (subject/predicate) of a sentence. So, like this: 

You see, homo is the nominative form, meaning it is the subject of the sentence. Homini is the dative form, meaning it is the indirect object of the sentence. There is no such thing in Portuguese. O homem é o lobo do homem: both the subject and the object take exactly the same form in Portuguese, because Portuguese has no case system. The only exceptions are personal pronouns, that still have two or three cases (eu/me/mim, tu/te/ti, - like English "I"/"me" - and are anyway not called "abessive", "ablative", "absolutive", etc; they are just called "caso reto" and "caso oblíquo" (literally, "straight case" and "oblique case"). Word order is relatively more free in Portuguese than in English, not because of nominal case inflections, but because of verbal person inflections. For instance, nós gostamos delas (We like them) has the verb inflected for first person plural, so we know that the subject can only be nós (we), and never elas, which is third person. This makes "delas gostamos nós" grammatically correct, because you cannot confuse subject and object (which isn't the case in English, were the verbal form for all persons, except third singular, is the same). But delas gostamos nós is by no means synonimous with nós gostamos delas. The latter means "we like them"; the former means "it is us who like them" (and delas nós gostamos means "it is them we like"). Because of this, those inverted order sentences are usually used anaphorically (except perhaps in literary register). Gosto eu de você is, by my reckoning, an ill-formed sentence. Eu gosto de você means "I like you", while de você gosto eu means "it is me who likes you", and de você eu gosto means "it is you that I like". But a VSO or VOS order seems to me simply wrong (except perhaps within longer constructions, like como o mar gosta da praia, assim gosto eu de você ("like the sea likes the shore, so I like you"), and even then it seems to me quite literary). That is perhaps because the inverted sentences, in Portuguese, are instances of topicalisation, and the verb cannot be topicalised. Você eu gosto, on the other hand, is grammatically wrong, because the verb gostar demands prepositioned (indirect) objects. So without the preposition "de", the sentence is ill-formed.
