I'm going to try to explain this from the manager's point of view. I'm also going to assume that the complaint was something fairly minor, the sort of thing nobody would fire you on the spot for but that might stick in someone's memory. Let's say that you forgot to tell somebody when a particular thing was ready, and they had to ask around to find out it was ready. A small complaint. For me, when someone does something minor wrong like that, I try to mention it to them right away. But I'm a busy person and I don't always get around to doing that, especially for something minor when I've got a lot on my plate. If too much time goes by before I get a chance to talk to them, bringing it up will make it seem like a bigger thing than it is, so I let it go and just try to remember to react quickly if it ever happens again. Especially if the person is a contractor who is only here for a few more weeks, I'll just let it go. I've got a lot of stuff to do and making a contractor into the ideal employee is optional work: the contractor is doing ok, so I just make a bit of a face and move on. But then, the contractor applies to be renewed. And I'm tasked with joining the interview. And I remember that time when people weren't notified and that was a problem. So I ask about it. Maybe to you it sounds like I'm complaining about it. Whatever. I bring the subject up. Am I allowed to? Of course. I can bring up any subject I like. What should you do about it? You should react as though you're in a job interview not as though this is a regular day at the office. You have two routes you can take - choose carefully. Route 1: agree with the interviewer and talk hypothetically about "next time": 

I think that's what your boss is hoping you will do. Along the way people will come to understand what your area of expertise can do for them, even if they never understand how it works. And you will learn more about the applications of your techniques to real world problems, including what those problems actually are and how they affect companies and people. 

Put it on your resume. When an interviewer asks about it, answer about the job, not the leaving of it. Focus on the aspects that paint you in a good light: you were helpful, enthusiastic, ensured the lines moved well, and so on. Talk about what you learned about dealing with people and following process. If someone happens to ask why you left the job, say that you misunderstood a policy about price overrides, did the wrong thing, and were fired as a result. Then immediately say what you learned - whether that's to pay more attention in training, or whatever insight you gained from the incident. I wouldn't automatically no-hire someone who was mistrained but is owning the mistake and clearly knows what went wrong. Don't use the word "theft" at any time - that just puts ideas in people's heads, and your motivation was not personal gain when you did these overrides, so don't start that conversation. 

Your last example though, that you gave this person a very direct order to fix something, is a little different. If this person is really your manager, you can't order them around and especially not with someone else nearby. A better way to word it would have been to use a less direct structure, something like 

Your peers and immediate supervisors, as well as the people your work actually helps, are the source of your visibility. These are the people who talk about you, who remember what you did and how you did it, and who care about the projects you're part of. Do they see you as a generous and helpful person, who is smart and hard working, and wants the best for the people who use your product? Or as a selfish grasper always concerned about the impact of every single sprint on your "brand" and the "arc of your career"? 

Your question reminds me of someone in my life who often asks highly specific (and odd) questions that turn out to be step 27 of some plan to solve something. She races through the plan until she hits a roadblock or lack of knowledge, and then asks just about that roadblock, without backing up to see if there is another way forward. In your case you have this chain 

Some very stodgy companies have made this transition in Canada, and I've seen this pattern a few times. First, it's a one time thing to raise funds for charity. People "pay" (by donating to the United Way) for the right to wear casual clothes on a specific day. This happens even for customer facing people like bank tellers. Typically they wear these stickers to explain: 

An important lesson for employees to learn is the difference between their own productivity and the productivity of the team. Let's say that if you use the standard issue chair, mouse, mousepad, and keyboard that you would have a productivity of 90/100, but with your custom preferences you would roar up to 98/100. But what if there are 10 people on your team who would each drop from 90 to 88 because they are irritated at you? That's a drop of 20 units and it wildly outweighs your gain. Ignoring the cost of the equipment you want, clearly management is ahead telling you to use the standard stuff. Or even if your team-mates don't care at all (which is unlikely) will your productivity increase earn the company the cost of this equipment? For a mouse, probably yes. Other things, probably no. The same principle (your productivity is not as important as team productivity) applies to observations that you're more productive if you work noon-8pm, or 4am-noon, or exclusively from home, or in a different programming language. You often have to accept a setup that is a little distance from your own optimum productivity in order to be available to team-mates, or for meetings, or so that you and your team-mates can substitute for each other on projects. And you often have to agree to use equipment that's good but not great, so that you don't appear demanding, or so that other people can use your equipment in a pinch, or just because the company doesn't have the money for what you consider great. It doesn't hurt to ask, if they are buying you things, if they can be the models you like. If the things they give you are actively terrible and unusable, you could try asking for different ones. But as a rule, learn how to work with what is provided to you, be as productive as you can be with that, and don't make a big fuss. I have bought people special mice and keyboards, but if you tried to get me to buy a $5000 chair, that's a much bigger request and not one that is likely to succeed. (One employee wanted a special trackball thing; when she left she asked if anyone else was likely to use it and everyone said "no" so (with our permission) she took it with her to the next job.) 

I mean really ask these questions and really listen to the answers. You may get some very important information about how she believes she manages her communications approach. You may learn that you are missing some cue to request communication. She may hear that you would like to be "a better communicator" and thus communicate with you more. Even if it doesn't improve things with this boss, it is likely to bring you good insight into her thought processes and decision making. Depending on how that part of the conversation goes, and if she's giving you career advice about stepping up in meetings etc, you could ask a hypothetical like 

This will flatter the chief far more than the typical "thank you for your service" and answer "why do you want to work here" and solve your issue around how to close your letter. 

I can hear you (and some other answerers) objecting to these rules, but they seem ok to me. It's better for you to take real vacation and people get fed up if one person on the team is "having a long weekend AGAIN" which is how it will feel if you use all ten days this way. If you want to take a week or more, just ask your boss "Is it ok if I take the last two weeks of October off?" and expect to get a yes. (In my firm, you'd get "sure, send me an email so I don't forget you'll be away.") If you want to take a day here and a day there, even though that goes against your company culture, make up a list of them and go to your boss saying "I have a bunch of personal business to take care of over the next few months and there are 8 days I will need to take off. Here's the list; is this ok?" Don't nickel-and-dime yourself or the company taking short-notice single-day breaks until you have used up all your PTO. You won't get the rest you deserve (it's clear reading your question you need a real vacation) and the company will find planning harder as well. Take it in one or two bunches, or make a plan to use a pile of it over a shortish period of time, and either way get it all approved at once. Everyone will sleep easier, including you.
