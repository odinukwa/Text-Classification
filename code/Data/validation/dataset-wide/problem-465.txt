In the MTB world, it's only XC (and closely related) disciplines that run a triple ring. Just take off the rings you don't want anymore and buy a chain device. If you only really do XC, then there is no need a buy a burly DH chain device with a bash guard, you just need one that has two rollers to squeeze the chain - as it joins and leaves the front ring. 

Just to add to lantius' answer, many DH bikes use tapered head tubes knowning full well that no triple-clamp forks use tapered steerers. They do this because you can then run much larger bearings on the lower race, thereby massively increasing their crush load. 

It's always difficult to diagnose noise descriptions, especially in the drivetrain. But guessing by the: 

I find a good starting point is to set the PSI so you lose about a third of the travel to sag on the front and rear. Then go and ride... Did it bottom out? Did it feel to marshmallowy in technical bits? Are you losing too much energy to pedal bob? Then up the PSI. Did it feel harsh and forgiving. Then lower the PSI. There is no magic answer for you, it depends on how active the suspension is, your weight, the terrain, etc. Only you know when it feels right, and that takes experimentation. Also just about all forks and shocks have at least external rebound and compression adjustment, the same applies to these controls. 

Don't bother - your bike, laptop bag, and cat litter were not lost. It was a horrible experience no doubt, but in the end you didn't lose anything. So what can be gained from this experience? Stopping anyone else's bike being stolen by the juvenile is the obvious one. 

You want a very low stand over height, short chainstays, steep headangle, and little to no suspension. If you still want to use it for general mountain biking stuff, then look at street or dirt jump bikes, rather than trials. 

The exact model is a Cane Creek 5 Zero Stack Tapered. I got this information from the Orange website (www.orangebikes.co.uk/bikes/archive/2012/elite_pro/), although as it isn't advertised on Cane Creek's website I would assume that it is an OEM product. You will need to get the dimensions so you can buy an alternative. I have to say though normally for integrated headsets that have become worn all you need to do is read off the bearing manufacturer code (laser etched onto the outer race usually), and find a replacement. 

Keep it lightly greased where it comes into contact with the hub bearing races and dropouts. This helps get it in and stops it seizing against the dropouts (the axle and dropouts are alu). 

Maxxis DH or Freeride tubes. They're not light but I've only ever once punctured the DH model - a 6inch nail through both side walls, so I won't hold it against them! 

Since the current answers are very road specific, I'll give my take on it for the disciplines I know. Downhilling can benefit from them because they deform less under load, so in theory last longer. But in practice BBs and hub bearings in this discipline tend to fail from corrosion brought on by failed seals, and although ceramic bearings won't rust - the race will. The lower shock load isn't an issue due to long travel suspension. For trials it really depends on how much of weight-weeny/rich you are. Ceramic bearings weigh far less than steel ones, so there's an instant benefit there. But, ceramic bearings are much less resistant to shock load so they will shatter, and because trials bike's are rigid, this will happen quickly. 

Compared to 26": They are heavier and/or weaker. They force frame designers to lengthen chainstays making bikes handle less well, as well having knock-on effects for rear suspension travel path. Personally I think they are another gimick standard, their lower rolling resistance may outweigh the negatives for mild off-road XC, but for anything else stick to 26". Your wallet will thank you. 

If only it was that simple. Different shocks behave differently on different frames with different air pressures/spring rates - it would be impossible to make a complete guide. Not to mention that how the bike feels to you is unquantifiable. It may be better to further expand your question to say why you don't like your current shock, and why you think changing it would make your bike feel better. It may just need to be sent away for a servicing. 

In Hebden Bridge, UK (and the surrounding area) the 'Hebden Bridger' buses have a bike rack on the back of them. 

Pinkbike recently did a little opinion piece it. To summarise they thought 29ers were better for open, fast XC; whilst the 26" dominated in downhill, technical sections. 650b (27.5") were considered to be poor in either domain, and not particularly liked by any of the 3 testers. But remember it's all opinion and it really depends on what you do with a bike. 

Straight-pull spokes have been around for awhile on MTB wheels, but mainly just on very expensive wheelsets (Mavic Deemax for example). Recently the better wheel component manufacturers have been getting in on this by selling straight-pull spokes and compatible hubs individually, and they are generally considerably more expensive than the 'normal' variety. However in my many years of snapping spokes they have never snapped at the elbow (the 'weak' point straight-pulls are supposed to address), they always break in the centre - presumably because the double-butting process has moved the weak point there. So my question is this: Are straight-pull spokes worth it, or are they another expensive marketing gimick to solve a problem that doesn't exist? 

In Hebden Bridge, UK you can drop your parts/whole bikes off at Cycle Recycle. It's a part of the Alternative Technology centre on the canalside. 

I've had rim tape before that didn't stick to the rim, but did stick to itself - which is all that matters really. As long as the rim tape won't separate from it's ends, it's doing it's job, plus the valve will stop it sliding around. 

The rotors cool very quickly (under 30 seconds for glove-meltingly hot to ambient). But the caliper can hold heat for some time, I'm very surprised at your 20min claim though - there's so little thermal mass. Modern disc brakes use an 'open' system which involves a reservoir with a metal diaphragm in, so when the fluid gets hot and begins to expand, the diaphragm expands rather than the pistons close. However this will only work to a certain point, after that your brakes will 'fade'. In my experience this usually boils down to the rider feathering the brake, i.e. letting the pad lightly touch the surface - not enough to slow you down noticeably, but enough to gradually generate a huge amount of heat over the course of a run. You'll be doing this without realising, I did, for years! Often it can be helped a lot by adjusting the lever: Lessen the lever reach and shorten the bite point. This will have the effect of lessening the modulation (which you don't need much of in DH) and lowering how far your brake finger (one finger for DH, you need the rest to hold on) has to reach to rest on the lever. The latter point has a big psychological effect because your hand is closer to being a fist and therefore feels like you have more grip - it's hard to grip a bar hard with an outstretched index finger, your body naturally wants to pull it in. If however, you get to the point where your brakes have faded, you will have to compensate for the larger fluid volume. To do this you will have slacken the bite point off until it feels the same as it did. 

Well first I recommend getting a pair of better brakes, the rain really shouldn't affect them much. I have been in the situation before when both brakes failed (it was a terrible Raleigh bike, and somehow during a ride both the cable end hoppeds out of the cantilevers), and I did what all kids do instinctively - put both feet flat on the road and put as much weight on them as possible. It wrecks your shoes, but it saves your face. 

Just to add to Dana's answer: If you don't know anyone who can show you the moves (always the best way to learn), then get onto Youtube and search for "MTB bunny hop training" and "MTB drop off training". You should find thousands of videos of people showing you what to do.
