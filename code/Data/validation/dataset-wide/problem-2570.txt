Only humans and the beings in the higher realms can attain enlightenment. Except for the ones in certain Brahma realms. Some beings in the lower realms may hear the Dhamma, memorise it and be born in higher realms as a result. 

#12 and #13 are the ones relevant to your question. So whether it is encouraged by the community or not, you will get merits(thousandfold/hundred thousandfold) if you give to beggars. ps: n-fold could mean a gift 'n' times bigger or a similar gift for 'n' number of lives. 

It's the same case with the example of the Bodhisatta. Make it a point to use the term 'Bodhisatta'. Not 'Buddha'. You either practice compassion and try to heal the bee or practice equanimity and let nature take its course. 

Sama-saddha: having compatible faith; they uphold the same religion, revere the same objects of worship, concepts, beliefs or principles, and share the same lines of interest- they are equally firm in all these or can reach agreement on them. Sama-sila: having compatible morality; they have conduct, morality, ethics, manners and upbringing which are harmonious or compatibility. Sama-caga: having compatible generosity; they are in accord, not conflict, with each other in their generosity, hospitality, munificence, sacrifice, and readiness to help others. Sama-panna: having compatible intelligence; they are sensible and can understand each other; they can at least reason with each other. 

I present the perspective of Zen through the eyes of Dogen to show a different shade of meaning of attachment and the universality of attachment and non-attachment as a precept of Buddhism $URL$ 

In searching for choosing inhospitable or uncomfortable environments, I discovered many practices that, at least for beginners, involve choosing a safe comfortable environment. $URL$ Here people are practicing in a natural environment that may not be a monastery: 

The beginner's mind does not leave us, we leave the beginner's mind whenever we identify with the thoughts in our mind or believe we are separate from our natural being. If we go to the original quote there is ample clarification of the sense intended $URL$ 

Seon for the most parts goes through fewer changes then either of its "parents." Now Gihwa enters the scene after centuries of decline in Seon in Korea and tends to revitalize and refocus Seon. Here is a little of his biography. Gihwa (1376-1433) 

Of course whenever you talk about clapping and Buddhism you get the sound of one hand clapping, a traditional koan. I replied to hopefully get some discussion going on this interesting topic. Unfortunately my googling has not show me much more. Thank you for the question. 

Oneself gets attached to that intonation Others get attached to that intonation Householders get angry: 'Those ascetics who are followers of the Sakyans' son sing in the same way that we do!' There is a break in concentration for those striving [to produce] musicality And the upcoming generations imitate what they see. 

From a Theravada perspective, there is absolute good and absolute bad. The 2 can exist mutually exclusively. Suffering is absolutely bad and the mind states that lead to suffering are absolutely bad. Nibbana is absolutely good and the mind states that lead to Nibbana are absolutely good. There is no suffering in Nibbana and there's no Nibbana in suffering. They arise/exist without requiring the presence of eachother. 

That again depends on the strength of it. Killing a mosquito is cruel. Embarrassing someone to have fun at some point in your life is also cruel. But a lifetime of anxiety can potentially be much more harmful to the person. There was a monk who kept all the pƒÅtimokkha rules to the letter. Once when he was going on a wooden raft, he raised his hand to touch a leaf of a branch that was leaning towards him. Since the raft was still moving while he was holding the leaf, the leaf was broken. Then the thought came to his mind that he has broken 1 of the Vinaya rules. He kept worrying about this for the rest of his life. Because of that, after he died, he was born as a cobra at the river bank. 

So there may be others who revitalized Seon, but in many ways the traditional practices and texts of Seon remained unchanged over a long time. Of all 3 Seon, Zen and Chan, the Korean practice seems the most like a mono culture with a tendency to remaining close to traditions.

On the other hand, if you want to experience whatever is in consciousness, Buddhism is a path to awakening consciousness. The problem is what you think is a black hole now stands in the way of your experiencing it in meditation. If you think of a black hole not as a vortex as it is often depicted, but as part of the dark matter and energy that scientists say compose 96% of the invisible universe. So Buddhism can lead you beyond the 4% of the visible to the 96% of the invisible and possibly unknowable by intellectual means. However consciousness has no such limits. So getting back to your question, if you want to study black holes scientifically, then other sites and practices would be better. On the other hand if your curiosity is even bigger to experience all there is in consciousness, then Buddhism offers you a way to get there. Meditation is the most likely tool you would want. Here is one type of meditation that you could practice $URL$ If this seems suitable to you, then I would most definitely read a few pages a day of Shunryu Suzuki's treatise on meditation that goes even beyond concepts of Buddhism. $URL$ If you want just the meditation, mindfulness could be a useful practice: $URL$ For whatever sincere reason you have to start practicing, I heartily endorse your entry. If it is right for you other doors will open. And in any case you will learn the most basic practice of being alive through being aware of the breath. 

The Buddha is omniscient. He has no doubts and needs no 1 week long mental conversation with a tree to know something :) 

Keep the marriage life and visit a monastery for meditation for couple of weeks every six months. Give up the marriage and get ordained. But before you do that, make sure your family has a steady income to survive. Keep the marriage and meditate whenever your wife does not need you. Keep the marriage and just be mindful of everything you do in lay life. 

Technically you don't follow the teachings of one Sammasambuddha to become another Sammasambuddha. You have to do it all by yourself. Even if you do Samatha/Vipassana meditation, you won't be able to go pass the Jhanas. Usually people who don't understand the enormity of the task are discouraged to have such aspirations. It all started for our Bodhisatva when he swam seven days in the ocean to rescue his mother, carrying her on his back. It is said that when the Mahabrahma saw this, he thought to himself that a being of such courage, energy and determination is worthy of aspiring for only one goal. That is to become a Sammasambuddha. So he planted the thought in the Bodhisattas mind through his mother. When they reached the shore, his mother's heart overflowed with happiness and gratitude and told the Boddhisatva "May you become a Buddha one day my wonderful son!". That is when the thought first entered his mind. From that point onwards, he thought about becoming a Buddha over a period of "Sath(seven) Asankya Kalpas". During that time he saw 125,000 Sammasambuddhas. After that he not only thought about it, but also spoke about his intentions of becoming a Sammasambuddha over a period of "Nava(nine) Asankya Kalpas". During that period, he met 387,000 Sammasambuddhas. So in total, he spent 16 Asankya Kalpas just thinking and speaking about it. Only after such a long time, he met the Buddha Deepankara and got the confirmation to become a Buddha in the future. Then he had to perfect the Dasa Paramitha in three ways over a period of "Sarasankya Kalpa Lakshaya". During that period he saw 27 Sammasambuddhas. So from the life he started thinking about it, he spent a total of (20*Anankya*Kalpa + 100,000*Kalpas) to attain Buddhahood. The next and the final Buddha who is going to appear before the end of the world is Buddha Maitreya. After him, there will be a period of vast number of Kalpas without any Buddhas. So, if you are thinking of becoming a Buddha, you will have to wait a very very long time. It is said that Pacceca Buddhas are a result of those who aspire to become Buddhas but never get the confirmation from another Buddha. If all of the above doesn't discourage you and if you think you are a person capable of great deeds like swimming for seven days to rescue your mother, start by cultivating Dasa Paramita. :) There's a detailed explanation about Paramitha in the Buddhawamsa. 

Note that right does not mean right as opposed to wrong. Right can mean when things go in the flow or without resistance (same page further down) 

It seems that one can enter the Bodhisattva way more easily than trying to attain the bhumis. Too much can be made of attaining, while not enough of serving others. I find the Dalai Lama's Book THE OPEN HEART to be a wonderful introduction to the Bodhisattva way. It is a book not only of words but pointing to action to free all sentient beings. If you want more info on bhumis you will find it in this article that even describes the bhumis as "hyperbolic". Perhaps that is a hint that we should stick more to basics and keep things simple. The Buddha gave us an example of a simple life. Some of those that followed tried to make it more complicated than it was. Remember the Flower Sermon. The Buddha holds up a flower and smiles. That is the whole sermon. $URL$ 

Thich Nhat Hahn is the only one I have read who attributes a significance to smiling. It may have to do with the challenging times he has had to endure. $URL$ The interview with him contains much of his practice, but here is an excerpt about smiling 

I've encountered this situation last year when venerable Yuttadhammo visited Sri Lanka. A wealthy lay family asked me through a mutual friend to arrange his accommodation at their house. But I had to refuse as it wasn't proper. 

For monks: There are, bhikkhus, these five drawbacks of reciting the Dhamma with a sustained melodic intonation. Which five? 

Actually there are 4 ways and they are all valid Theravada techniques. Problem occurs when misinformed people start saying only one of these techniques is correct. 

Monotheism falls under Sassatha Ditti. It is one of the two false views that prevents one from progressing in the path. Such beliefs are called Maggavarana Ditti. But it does not prevent the path to heavens. Then again, you don't really need Buddhism to reach heavens. But if Nibbana is what you are looking for, you have to give up Monotheism at some point. You won't get far as long as you cling to such a belief. Buddha preached the Dhamma to non-Buddhists, but they gave up their false views once they've embraced the Dhamma. Nobody attained enlightenment while still retaining such misbeliefs. It's not even technically possible. 

samatha is a term frequently used. No problem defining that. Passadha is not easily defined by web search. It appears and Portuguese and greek. here is a link referring to passadha referring to the eye center. $URL$ Perhaps there are other terms for passadha that are more widely used. 

Here is what the Nirodha Samapatti is defined as $URL$ Here is the Phala Samapatti progessions $URL$ Here is a discussion of if this kind of discussion is fruitful $URL$ I am not a strong supporter of discussion as a fruitful path to cessation as much as practice but I respect the right of all to choose for everyone may have a different path. It is not for me to say. 

An almost identical text is also quoted at $URL$ Shakyamuni Buddha taught monks sermons on the four noble truths and other precepts. My memories are that the Buddha encourages people to take the precepts, study them, try to incorporate them into a meditation practice and finally into one's life. the online dictionary in google also defines dogma "a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority {emphasis mine} as incontrovertibly true." I have never studied or read a teacher that speaks of incontrovertible [not able to be denied or disputed]. truth in Buddhist literature. The Dalai Lama talks about monks debating all aspects of Buddhist precepts to strengthen their understanding. Discussion and debate are part of the path, including this website. Dogma also implies a certain blind acceptance of statements without thoroughly digesting them and struggling with them. Buddhism does have principles but by swallowing them whole you will only get spiritual indigestion. Taking one principle and putting it into practice is a more effective strategy than trying to swallow the fish whole. It is possible to come to conclusions by meditating and practicing mindfulness, but what you will find out is waiting for your experience to reveal with its fruit. The truth is not in the words, the truth is in non-attachment to everything that impedes a direct experience of what is. 

But that's for finding friends in general. In case of marriage, it should be applied in the first place, when you are looking for a partner to get married to. 

You don't have to love or hate your work. If happiness arises while at work, be mindful of it and if aversion arises while at work, be mindful of that too. 

There's no such thing as "Electromagnetic energy" from a Vipassana(insight) meditator's point of view in Buddhism. It's all just seeing, hearing, smelling ,tasting, touching, thinking. 

Anatta can be seen even by the average Joe. Ex: when there's headache or any kind of bodily pain, why it is not going away at will? When you taste something, why the taste disappear after eating? Why can't you make the taste persist. Why your body stink when you don't take bath? Why can't you stop that from happening? When happiness arises in the mind, why does it fade away without your consent? 

That's like asking how long would it take for you to start tasting the curries that are already on your plate. Or like asking how long will it take for you to taste almonds and cashews when you are eating a mix of nuts. It's just a matter of you deciding to practice awareness on them. Cittanupassana When your mind wanders thinking about past/present/future or when your mind becomes concentrated/scattered, you can be mindful of it to practice the 3rd Satipattana Dhammanupassana If you decide to practice mindfulness on seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting etc. or the five hindrances, that's the 4th Satipattana. 

Rather than faithfulness to a doctrine, what it implies is faith in the process so that at all points of development from a shoot out of the mud, to blooming, it is the process of awakening. The third meaning refers to faithfulness. Those who are working to rise above the muddy waters will need to be faithful followers [of the process] (note added by soulsings) Each color implies a different quality of the buddha mind. 

So the above citations begin to outline the differences between Zen, Chan and Seon. The question is did these different traditions radically change at a certain point in history like Zen in Japan under Suzuki. 

Well there are more than one meaning to the lotus image. It is a multi-layered symbol. $URL$ the meaning of the muddy waters, physicality being the ground out of which the nirvana experience grows. 

No argument with any of the answers. Here is what might be called "barebones Buddhism" 1) follow the breath with awareness 2) have compassion and understanding for all beings including oneself 3) dedicate one's efforts and life for the benefit of all. There are ways to express that in Buddhist terms, but if you wanted to explain it to a child and hit the major points, that is enough.
