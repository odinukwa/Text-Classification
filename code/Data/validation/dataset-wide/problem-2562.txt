@user2929.. now that you have told a bit more about yourself, I have to add this & edit my post. To tell you being an introvert is a blessing in disguise. It is a good thing. Just try to reflect on this… A person can say that he/she is shy and would sound as if it is bad. I do not think so. Only those who have the innocence and gentleness, who have the shyness and fear to do wrong are the fortunate few (ones who have Hiri & Othappa”). They are the ones who will see the Dhamma and walk the Noble Eight Fold Path if they put their mind to it. People who do not seek large crowds tend to turn their attention inwards, and there are very few of them in the world today. Buddha has pointed out that they have a far greater chance of going to heaven and finding liberation. Still I am not going to change what I said before. This is a higher goal for you, that you got to work towards. The day that you come to the realization that what you conventionally call a ‘person’ can be understood in terms of five aggregates of clinging, and that the sum of which must not be taken for a permanent entity, your awkward feeling of self-consciousness will vanish. It is because you are now mindful of your true nature - that you are nothing but an amalgam of ever- changing phenomena. If you do not acquire a thorough understanding of the five aggregates of clinging, you will not be able to grasp the liberation process at work within you. In reality you and I are nothing but an amalgam of the five aggregates of clinging. So please try to think it through. 

I agree with robermann's comment, and if I am to add something to it, it is this. We have to have a strong belief that the path to Nibbana exists in this Dhamma. One who has that confidence meditates carefully. Does it in an orderly manner. This requires some time. It does not happen in a day or two. Not in a week, in a month or two or in a year or two. We cannot restrict it to a short period. With metta.... 

The term that the Buddha used to describe his disciples was ‘savakas’, that is to say, listeners or hearers. The importance of listening to Dhamma is clear from this, [and THIS ]. Today we are unable to hear his teachings directly from the Buddha. The next best thing is the Suttas that contain a close record of the Buddha’s own words. Meditation without the Dhamma is not sufficient. The Suttas describe five conditions through which we can become Ariya, a Noble One. They are: Listening to the Dhamma, Teaching the Dhamma, Repeating the Dhamma, Reflecting on the Dhamma, Meditating. This shows that only one of the four factors are within meditation, the other four are out of meditation, ie. listening, teaching, repeating and reflecting on the Dhamma. For this we have to refer to the Buddha’s original discourses found in the Anguttara, Samyutta, Digha and Majjhima Nikayas. 

Buddha kept silent in response to Vacchagotta’s question because answering it in either way, it would have been misunderstood. This nature of the self is beyond the level of understanding of Vacchagotta. He is not yet at that stage in his spiritual development. Buddha never denies the existence of the self. He rejects annihilationism. Read the Alagaddupama Sutta (MN 22), Yamaka Sutta (SN 22.85), Kalama Sutta (AN 3.65), Ananda Sutta SN 44.10. In fact Buddha explained this when asked by the Venerable Ananda about his silence regarding Vacchagotta’s question. He said that this would have lead Vacchagotta to misinterpret the answer in a way that would bring him further attachment. With regard to self, the Buddha said to Ananda in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, to stay as those who have the self as island, as those who have the self as refuge, as those who have no other refuge. (DN 16). As per the scriptures existence is real, but it is transitory. 

Joanna Jurewic would have tried to interpret Dependent Origination from the perspective of “Vedic thought", but what is important to you and I is to clearly understand what Dependent Origination (paticcasamupada) is. The Blessed One said that if you would be freed of dependant arising, if there is no dependant origination, there is no you in terms of that. When there is no you in terms of that, there is no you there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. Then you would be liberated”. The doctrine of Paticcasamuppāda (Pāli); Dependant Arising is THE MOST IMPORTANT part of Buddhist metaphysics. It states that phenomena arise together in a mutually interdependent web of cause and effect. This is the understanding that any phenomenon ‘exists’ only because of the ‘existence’ of other phenomena in an incredibly complex web of cause and effect covering time past, time present and time future. Because all things are thus conditioned and transient (anicca), they have no real independent identity (anatta) so do not truly ‘exist’, though to ordinary deluded minds this appears to be the case. Simply stated this can be said as: 

If you would takes the time to read the Dukkhata Sutta in the Samyutta Nikaya you will get to know what is meant by suffering as per Dhamma. We suffer when we cannot maintain things to our satisfaction. Therefore, you yourself can find out the truth of it, by seeing whether there is anything in this world that can be maintained to your satisfaction. Our world can be summed up by saying that it is what we experience through our internal six senses (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind). As long as we can have good, pleasant experiences we are happy, otherwise, we get sad and suffer. We suffer because of ‘Anicca’. Things are subjected to decay and destruction, and nothing in this world is exempt from that. This is viparinäma dukkha, suffering that arises due to change and decay. Whether we are wealthy or poor we all suffer as suffering is in our minds. A wealthy person may suffer due to a loss of something he had, and a poor person may suffer due to the inability get what he wants. Either person becomes distraught due to his/her mind activities - attachment to what one has or craving for what one desires. This mental suffering is called sankhära dukkha. It arises through the struggles we engage in trying to maintain things to our satisfaction. The third category of suffering arises due to immoral deeds, and may not become evident in this life. For example, a person who made money by killing another or by stealing from another may live well in this life (at least outwardly), but will be subjected to much suffering in the upcoming births. This is the suffering of dukkha dukkha, which can lead to rebirth in the four lower realms.
