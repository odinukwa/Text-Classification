I'm not a big fan of defining definitions. However to draw line to present a captured concept, maybe I should. a) Morality could only be applied when there are more than oneself present. b) In gross morality defines an act that preserve others interest, or increase others interest. In such case Ken's jumping the queue can never be morally permissible. If they want to sit together or get on the same bus, why can't his friend jump out of the queue? 

His friend has violated others' rights, he is just the component of the queue, his sequence relative to other members that doesn't give him possession the position in the queue, therefore he doesn't have the right to insert new member to change the sequential relativity. But this type of minor hiccups that we act in convenience and amiability are common in the world, that's what made life lively, the beauty of ambiguity, giving chances people to experience their emotions and minds. For example, there could be someone being upset in the queue while some wouldn't bother, some may even go and pull Ken out. Looks like the UK people are the most ardent flocks in dispelling moral ambiguity :), according to the comment. 

Well, rather, I would propose the question be reformatted to this: Are science and art the difference lenses human mind used to look at the world? For I think there is one human mind, the different lenses won't change the human mind but they do express/depict the human mind differently. The expressed/depicted human mind of course is not that human mind, but expressions and depictions only. Therefore with the human mind as intact, can't be changed, the different lenses of science and art stemmed from the same source thus the world these instruments painted on the surface looked different but intrinsically parallel and translatable between each other. All of them are describing the world in terms of patterns, and pattern can only be formulated by describing the relationship between each other. That is pattern, a descriptive tool for differentiating thus locating parts of the whole, in terms of dot, line, plane, cube, color in art; in terms of gravity, speed, space-time, distance, particles... etc in science. Likewise, musical pattern can be completely translated back to mathematical ratios. 

But then there will be another yes, for there is no world in the first place, except human mind. The world emerged due to the nature of human mind and it's capacity; however, again this would make the initial question too complex, a one-step-at-a-time approach is more desirous. 

Well, a short answer is no. A textile machine can be weaving the Epic of Gilgamesh in silk but he [the machine] doesn't know that's a Sumerian mythology. To examine the idea inversely, a person suffered from down syndrome doesn't generate idea doesn't stand that he is not human but a machine. In certain teaching, it explaint perfectly that a human being is a made of three factors: sperm + ovum + gandharva. While in lab the body part (sperm & ovum) can be produced it's not certain how gandharva could be called in to complete the creation, maybe voodoo magic? Just a joke :D. Think in another way, if a worm biting a piece of wood (borrowing parable from somewhere) forming a pattern looks like letter "W", does the worm [the machine] know that's a letter? If the worm by sheer chance, biting out a pattern that rivals Picasso's, is the worm creative or generates idea? == trailing: however, by manipulation of the incomplete knowledge called science science the new religion, we will see machines are humans whilst humans are machines in the future == 

Third, they give us new knowledge. Trying to strictly reason can reveal our own biases, mistakes and assumptions, and that is new knowledge. Finally, the fact that math and logic have given us powerful tools to solve problems that we were otherwise unable to solve flies in the face of them being merely "restatements of knowledge". In short, don't think of math or logic as restating knowledge; think of them as generating new knowledge using existing knowledge and strictly defined derivation rules. This whole question of knowledge and what we already know reminds me of Plato -- namely Meno's Slave. 

Short Answer: Dreaming is a form of consciousness. Long Answer: I have a concern with defining consciousness as the "memory of forming new memories". First, are we pushing things back by treating memory as a synonym for consciousness (I want to avoid Cartesian Theater fallacies by claiming consciousness of a memory)? Second, do we have memories of memories, or memories of experiences? Third, do we ever experience forming memories or simply experience itself? What about this definition (from here), which states that Consciousness is... 

It depends. Let's focus on Vedanta (and I'll include Budhism here). There's a tradition of attention to phenomena and a letting go of thoughts related to them that has a very empiricist (more specifically, phenomenological) flavor. Buddhists even denied substance ontology in a way that brought to mind Bundle Theory. Further, an (apparent) Western encounter with Vedanta led to Pyrrhonism, which itself became a hardcore empiricist view. Granted, when people think of Pyrrhonism, they think Skepticism, yet it's clear Pyrrhonism places a great premium on phenomena, and thus its empiricist commitment is (IMO) clear. On the other hand, Vedanta has many non-empiricist assumptions, some of which guide the otherwise empiricist meditation itself. 

Mathematics is infinite Mathematics represents the multi-verse and beyond Mathematics is the cause of everything we know to exist Mathematics represents a Deterministic view of the world 

Short Answer: No, because the odds of winning on this wager are extremely low so no case (including Strong Agnosticism) justifies taking it. Long Answer: This wager only seems reasonable (to some) because of its implicit (unfounded) assumptions. Take these assumptions away and you'll see this wager is simply not worth playing. In particular this wager assumes that... 

Premise (1) is false. That alone causes the argument to fall apart. Premise (2) is false. I've had numerous instances of sleep "paralysis" and it is possible to control the body; it's just very difficult. If you really focus hard and try to lift a finger or toe, you will do so and will snap out of it. You might as well argue that the mind cannot be part of the body because it's hard to move your limbs when you are tired. To look at your argument another way, take the analogy of a car. Your steering wheel, gas and brake control the car, and they are a part of it. Yet if the connections from these components to the wheels, engine, etc... are severed, they will fail to control the car. Do you then argue that these are not part of the car because they could be severed? Also, to beat this mind-body dualism dead horse, what about what happens to the mind when the body is damaged? For instance, if one were hit hard on the head, one would lose consciousness. How do you claim mind body dualism when the mind ceases upon damage to the body? Do you claim that the mind is separate, yet dependent upon the body? Is such a position even coherent?
