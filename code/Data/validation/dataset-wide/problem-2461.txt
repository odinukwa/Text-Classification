As a monk how would you handle a homeless person who wants to stay in your temple? If you are not a monk just give the hypothetical answer based on your present knowledge assuming you are a monk. 

It appears to me those Brahmins believed in none existence. It appears they did not believe in kamma and rebirth. What Buddha taught was the dependent origination. It is not enough to understand the not self. That has to be realised through dependent origination. 

"Suppose a hen has eight, ten, or twelve eggs: If she doesn't cover them rightly, warm them rightly, or incubate them rightly, then even though this wish may occur to her — 'O that my chicks might break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely!' — still it is not possible that the chicks will break through the egg shells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out safely. Why is that? Because the hen has not covered them rightly, warmed them rightly, or incubated them rightly. In the same way, even though this wish may occur to a monk who dwells without devoting himself to development — 'O that my mind might be released from effluents through lack of clinging!' — still his mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clinging. Why is that? From lack of developing, it should be said. Lack of developing what? The four frames of reference, the four right exertions, the four bases of power, the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors for Awakening, the noble eightfold path. $URL$ 

But if one's beginners mind has gone is it possible to regain it. If so what can one do to get a beginner's mind back again. The motivation for asking this is that after a years practice I had a very strong feeling of my beginners mind leaving me. I felt very fresh, vibrant and curious about practice for about a year then one day I could literally feel that ebb away. From that point my practice was different - maybe not worse but definitely has a different quality to it. It feels more like work I guess. So I've always been curious to whether that initial state would ever come back and if there was anything I could do to encourage it. 

I've even read park keepers being mentioned in some sutta I've read. This as always struck me as achronistic. The notion of parks where the Buddha can spend time seems odd. If they were pieces of land owned by Kings and nobility I would have expected the translation to be rendered private gardens or the like. To me the word park gives the impression of some kind of public or communal ownership. So what were the parks that existed 2500 years ago in India. Were there really pieces of land with some kind of common ownership that anyone could go to. Is it a translation issue and there are other possible translations to this that don't give the impression of a communal kind of ownership? Is it just me that finds this odd? 

You have to keep the five precepts constantly in your mind. After while it becomes second nature to you. 

Wellcome to the club. This a common problem for many of us. I suggest you start reading Sutta directly. Also, remember it is gradual training. You have some insight already, otherwise, you won't be here posting this question. 

Samma Samadhi (right concentration) is a specific word in Buddhism to describe form realm and no form realm in conjunction with noble eight fold path. (please note Samma or Right) If you take only the word concentration it could well be applicable to the realm of desire as well. We all (every mind moment) have one-pointedness when we concentration on any object. You can concentrate only one object at a time. 

"Formerly, bhikkhus, the Dasaarahas had a summoning-drum. As the drum began to split the Dasaarahas inserted one peg and then another peg until in time the summoning-drum's old drumhead had disappeared and only a framework of pegs remained. "Even so, bhikkhus, will the bhikkhus become in the future. And those discourses spoken by the Tathaagata, profound in meaning, transcendental, dealing with voidness, to these they will not listen when they are recited, they will not lend an ear, they will not set the heart upon final knowledge[48] and will not consider that those things should be learned and mastered. But those discourses made by poets, poetry, mere beautiful words and phrases, spoken by outsiders and disciples, to these they will listen... they will consider that these things should be learned and mastered. "Therefore, bhikkhus, I say, you should train yourselves thus: "'Those discourses spoken by the Tathaagata profound in meaning, transcendental, dealing with voidness, to these we will listen when they are recited, we will lend an ear, we will set the heart upon final knowledge and we will consider that these things should be learned and mastered.'" — SN 20.7 

In this Partially Examined Life podcast the presenters stated that when Buddhism moved into Chinese it naturally was influenced by the pre-existing Taoist philosophy which is uncontroversial. However they then when on to make this stronger claim that 

Even though emptiness (Śūnyatā) seems like it should just be one thing (concept/experinece/realisation) does it in fact have different types? Can it be categorised in any way? I know Buddhism is very keen on lists. Is there a list of different types of emptiness in any tradition? The motivation for this question is that I remember hearing that there were 32 types of sūnyatā. However I can't remember where I heard this so I'm hoping that this question might cast some light on that issue. If anyone could provide reference to canonical texts, commentaries or other sources about this, that would be particularly good. 

For instance I practice with the Triratna Buddhist community and we have our own refuge tree (shown below). At the bottom is Sangharakshita winding its way to his teachers (e.g. Dhardo Rimpoche) and up to more historical figures (Hakuin, Milarepa) and into the mythic (Amitabha, Ratnasambhava) up to the Buddhas past present and future (Shaykamuni, Dipankara, Maitreya). 

If anger arises while you watching a movie or playing a computer game, it is a good idea that you are aware of your mental state. 

This is quite normal.Be aware of your feelings and use your commonsense. There is a story where a woman (female monk) had fallen love with Ven Ananda and a beautiful woman was proposed to Buddha. Here is another story. ------------ Just as they were leaving the city the Venerable Maha Kaccana was standing at the city gate, putting on his outer robe before entering to walk on alms round. When the youth Soreyya beheld the golden-hued body of the elder, he thought to himself: "Oh, that this elder might become my wife! Or may the hue of my wife's body become like the hue of his body!" At the very moment this thought passed through his mind, Soreyya was instantly transformed from a man into a woman. Startled by this inexplicable change of sex, he jumped out of the carriage and fled before the others could notice what had occurred. Gradually he made his way to the city of Takkasila. His companions searched for him in vain and reported his strange disappearance to his parents. When all attempts to trace him proved futile, his parents concluded that he had died and they had the funeral rites performed. $URL$ 

In her book Zen and the Art of Consciousness Susan Blackmore did exactly what you are doing and spent a couple of weeks being very mindful and noting during her everyday life. Her question was 'am I conscious now?' She found this very productive and interesting but she said it was unsustainable for her. She reached a point where she was so aware that she was unable to cross the road. She found the speed of the traffic too overwhelming. She had to stop the practice at this point. I would hesitate to say don't do it because I'm really not any kind of expert but I just wanted to share that second hand experience. Certainly mindfulness in the everyday is an ideal but I'm not sure if I could go full on for it. Maybe little and often? 

OK this is an answer based on personal experience of study of the White Lotus Sutra. The sutra itself is highly repetitive and plays with concepts of time and space throughout. Although there are parables (for instance the burning house) throughout which can be easily seen as teaching points the suta as a whole seems to be something else. I believe it is the sutra itself that is the practice and the boredom, aggrevation and frustration with it is part of that. I felt it was more like a very long koan. The point wasn't to understand it as such just to bear with it almost and see what comes up in your own experience. I often hear people complain about Mayahana sutras as been too long, too mystical, too rarified, too religious maybe or just ridiculous. But if the sutras as seen as a (meditation) practice rather than a guidebook that i think that goes a long way to understanding what they actually are and understanding how to work with them. Just my experience as I say. 

Thanks all. Based on your answers I came to the following conclusion. Papanca is the unwholsome Vicara just before the first Jhana. Further reading. $URL$ $URL$ ... ca/5706/10 

It is gradual training. Take one step at a time. Do not try to eat the whole elephant in one bite. -) 

Kamma does not operate on it's own. It operates within other five Niyamas. (Bija, Dhamma, kamma,Citta and Uthu) Perhaps other kamma may come under Bija (as Chris W suggest) and Dhamma Niyamas. 

Say you are an American. (as I do not know your nationality) Now imagine that there is only this earth without any boarders. (no countries but one world) Now imagine we all help and look after each other as one human from earth. We do not have wars between countries. (because there is only one world) Now you expand this concept to whole world without any discrimination and extend your love and compassion to all (animal,human, Deva or even the beings in lower worlds) That is how I see the immeasurable mind. 

Our present existence is the result of our past belief in a self. We have this wrong view until we attain Nibbana. 

The Pali Canon definition of a stream entrant is one who have abandoned the first three fetters namely 

I've always experienced a lot of anxiety. In many ways that was and remains a driving force in my practice. More recently I've experienced more fear. I feel fearful and under threat. They do feel different but I'm still working with them and will be for a long time. In terms of the Buddhist texts and psychology what is the difference between fear and anxiety? Are they spoken about as different things? Are there different Pali/Sankrit terms for them? Is there different ways of working with them? 

In Buddhism as I have been taught it, the mind is included as part of the six senses. So in contrast with the 'normal' five senses we have those five plus mind giving us six. However mind still feels different in some way to the other senses. Is there anywhere in the Buddhist texts where it is acknowledged that mind is in some way special or separate from the other senses. Or is that just an illusion and closer reflection would reveal that actually it is no more different to the others than hearing or vision. 

The way I understand, the holocaust or atomic bombing of Japan can be explained by dependent origination and Kamma. what is important to understand is that all are not the result of Kamma. 

What really matters for a lay person as per Buddhist teaching is whether you are at least a Sotapanna which assures you the enlightenment withing seven births. As far as you have the right livelyhood you do not have to worry being materialistic and being rich. 

Comments from the following link: $URL$ Bhagava: also rendered "the Auspicious One" or "the Exalted One"; the most frequent appellation of the Buddha, though not restricted to Buddhist usage. The word "Bhagava," can be translated as "the Blessed One" 

It depend on whether you practice Samatha or Vipassana. In Samatha practice you suppress the hindrances. They are fully eradicated by Vipassana practice and following Noble Eightfold Path. 

I think you are assailed with Vitakka and Vicara. This is a common activity of our mind. Be aware of these thoughts. If they are wholesome (Samma Sankhappa) then they are OK. 

The Eightfold path is practice in many different levels. The eightfold path practice by five preceptors is not the same as an Arahant. To answer your question as a lay person you are expected only to follow the Eightfold path in line with the five precepts. So there is no need to give up all your passions and desires. As a layperson, you can practice eight precepts on Uposatta days. This is optional. 

A meditation teacher I once had said that access concentration (the stage before the jhanas) is the same level of concentration that one has when reading a good book or when fully engaged in conversation. However when I've read about it in other places it makes it seem like it is a more special level of concentration, perhaps one that you wouldn't ordinarily experience in your day to day life. Which point of view is more correct? How concentrated is access concentration and how would one recognise it? 

Can anyone provide short (maybe a couple of sentences) summaries of the main schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the differences between them. In fairly certain there are 4 main schools but I could be wrong in that. Also if there are more minor schools of interested then a link to further information on those too would be really good. I've read a bit about Tibetan Buddhism but the characteristics and differences of the main schools just won't lodge in my mind so this would satisfy bit of personal interest really. Many thanks for all responses.
