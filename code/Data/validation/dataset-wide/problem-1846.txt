For this you need to make another virtual host that has the different settings, and for the redirects you want under "this situation" use that vHost instead. This is not PHP code, it's Apache language. Sorry. There are no if-thens. 

Using standard https to view files on the server, does that generate any ssl error messsages? If so, it means your certificates are not set up properly. If there are no errors, I have no idea what's goin on unless there is a secondary level if restrictions for creating them. 

You'd still need to maintain a list like my original answer (above) to disallow the bots that ignore robots.txt. 

You can't do that without vHosting. If you can wait till 4pm eastern, I'll give you the code to do so. I'm not around my server now. 

I have figured this out thanks to @citrin's comment. Adam Weinberger reported this as a bug here. He also provided two patches for two different desirable options: pre-building the man pages, or building cmake without them. I opted for the latter one. The attachment here includes little fixes to the Makefile and pkg-plist of the corresponding port. I just updated my cmake Makefile and pkg-plist with the new lines, and voila! There was another config option for manpages, and after I chose not to build with manpages, the dependency disappeared. 

Ports are one of the most powerful features of FreeBSD. You can search and browse the ports collection easily at FreshPorts. 

first enable sql remote connections $URL$ second open windows fw if you are using it on port 1433 (or whatever port you configured) for sql. 1433 is the default. 

The permissions are based on the IUSR (anonymous by default) or the application pool identity. The best tool to help determine if there are permission issues is using process monitor by sysinternals. Auditing will tell you right away if there are denies. If so, adjust folder security to meet your requirements. $URL$ 

You could use process explorer by sysinternals to see what files are locking the process. Also, have you checked if your anti-virus is locking it? 

Good question :) You'd need a decent box to handle 10k requests per sec, in the IIS architecture to handle this type of load, you'd want a web-farm of boxes. http.sys > Process Activation Service > w3wp is the path a request takes. Each app pool has queues to process requests at a time. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ IIS 8 has NUMA support, this helps with scaling. $URL$ There are other factors, which type of content and application. :) 

Notice the two different document roots. Also notice that they listen for a specific domain. For the other part of making all subdomains go to x.y.com, use mod_rewrite: Pop this in the .htaccess file: 

Here's the deal: Fix the C:/'s in my example and update the paths for yours. Make sure you have the "NameVirtualHost" at the top of the vHosts section. 

Try FileZilla Server for Windows: $URL$ That will let you create password protected users with some of these settings: $URL$ (PDF file with screenshots). It does work on allowing you to attach network drives if you first map them to a letter under the Host. (In the server-computer, map folder XYZ to letter A-Z (one that's not in use) so that accessing drive X (or whatever letter you choose) will indeed open the folder of choice. Then under filezilla, grant a user access to drive X (or which you choose). If you need more help, ask. 

I have found the solution to my own question. Below are the lines 507-513 from program/steps/mail/sendmail.inc. 

You can't. Sorry. But if what you seek is to add scalability, i.e. to be able to add new projects without editing the nginx config, then you can implement a slightly different approach. Create a folder in the same directory with your nginx config. For the sake of this example, I'll take the name project_configs. My nginx.conf is located in so I'd just create . Instead of repeating location blocks, you can just add to your nginx config, and create a new file in for each project and write the location block in it. Your nginx config should look like this: 

I would consult the vendors website for this type of question. It appears to have an active and well documented @ $URL$ Redmine 2.1.2. 

by default in IIS 7.5, the applicationpoolidentity (aka i_AppPoolName) is used. I would NOT grant write perms and only grant on the folder(s) needed to support your app. Network service was the default account in IIS 6 and wasn't the best account. MS made a change in 7.x. 'note the default app pool name should be changed to whatever you have. ICACLS C:\inetpub\wwwroot /grant "IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool":(M) You can do this from the GUI in r2/iis 7.5 The other option is to grant the IIS_IUSRS group modify, the app pool command line above is the most secure. I just wouldn't grant modify on all folders. Personally, I use the IIS_IUSRS perms architecture as my servers are not shared hosting servers. 

I have recently set up a mail server that consists of and . Yesterday I added and to the mix. SPF, DKIM, DMARC, rDNS records are all done. Gmail treats my mail as valid and delivers it to my inbox. Everything is working. Except one little annoying thing. When I use Android's built-in MUA or other MUA's, everything is still fine. The problem begins when I want to send mail using roundcube. The mail is still verified and delivered correctly, but without subject. Somehow roundcube is losing the subject field and sending my e-mails without the subject. I have been searching for an answer for 7 hours straight, however it seems like I am the only person in the world that is experiencing this problem. This makes me think that something is wrong with my server or configs or something, but I quadruple-checked all of my configs and I am still clueless. Any help will be highly useful. Thanks in advance for your time. My mail server is on an OpenVZ box with 768MB RAM, running CentOS 7 Minimal. Postfix version: 2.10.1 Dovecot version: 2.2.10 Roundcube version: 1.1.0 My output: 

Are these local accounts or domain accounts? If these are local accounts, they can't be moved. Are these IIS or windows users? You can review the applicationHost.config (make a backup copy first) and see what configuration is stored in there. I asked a question about moving IIS manager users to another machine, a MS team member mentioned this. We need a bit more information. As far as moving the configuration over. You could try copying the sites configuration specific to the FTP site by copying and pasting the particular configuration. This involves the XML so it's not very straight forward, but is an option. $URL$ 

Can you look in the iis logs and see what the sub-status code is on the 401. Here is a list of codes posted by MS $URL$ The HTTP status code in IIS 7.0, IIS 7.5, and IIS 8.0 $URL$ you could also use failed request tracing to see what is happening. $URL$
