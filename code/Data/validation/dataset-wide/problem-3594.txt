I don't think alcohol consumption directly causes cheeks to "get bigger". You may have gained weight because while drinking alcohol people tend to consume extra calories. Try consuming less alcohol and following a more sensible diet with exercise. 

Your question is basically one that addresses full range of motion (ROM) versus “cheat” movements. Exercising a muscle (any muscle) through its full ROM tends to provide more long term benefits than “cheating” for the simple fact that full ROM tends to correlate with strict form. Full range movements also tend to enforce a longer time under tension. Lastly, those that use “cheat” movements are typically more interested in the “numbers” (sets, reps, etc.) rather than doing the exercise(s) correctly. In my opinion, full ROM movements win out every time. 

The human body is not perfectly symmetrical. One side tends to be more dominant than the other. Having said that, and, barring any consideration for preexisting injuries, there's no reason why you can't train the right calf to bring it up to the level of your left. 

One hand up, match, other hand up. Go as high as possible, remembering to have enough energy to come back down. Come back down the reverse way. One hand down, match, other hand down. One hand up, match. First hand down, match. Repeat. Keep one hand on the same rung. Move the opposite hand up one rung. Keep moving the same hand up until you can't go any higher. At your limit, cut loose with your feet and then put your feet back on the same rung. Match your top hand with the lower hand directly. Do other side. Reach up with one hand as high as possible. Then campus down with that same hand until you match on the starting rung. Do other hand. Lots of other ideas and patterns ... 

I started skipping when I started CrossFit. If you are not good at skipping and are trying to get good enough for fitness, you should look for a rope that spins nicely, is moderately thick and isn't too heavy. 

Rock climbing is largely a skill sport, so to get better, climb more. Being generally fit also helps, but to be a better rock climber, you need to climb a lot. If you want to specifically do extra work for rock climbing you should start off with identifying your weaknesses. From my experience in my climbing gym, the biggest weaknesses are grip strength and flexibility. Things you can do at home You can train your grip with something like the Black Diamond forearm trainer. You could probably just find a block of wood and just squeeze it. Real holds don't have any give after all. Don't use a regular grip trainer. Your closed grip is probably relatively strong. You probably want to train your open handed grip positions (like you're holding a fat hold). You can also try Metolius Rock Rings. They are like a pair of mini hang boards that you can just hang somewhere. They come with an example program. Flexibility is also worth working on as increased flexibility open up moves that you may not be able to perform at the moment. I find leg flexibility more limited than shoulder/arm flexibility. I'm not confident in prescribing stretches but perhaps someone at your gym can give you a few pointers. Add drills to your regular climbing time Use the campus boards and hang boards in the climbing gym. You can do various drills before you climb: 

A 2005 study in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that for highly trained athletes, 2 weeks of detraining seems to be the amount of time that muscle atrophy tends to occur. This seems to be because of the differences in the initial muscle fiber size and the conditioning level of the athlete. 

Anecdotally speaking, I think you may be correct. Some of us have one or more body parts that tend to be stubborn when it comes to gaining mass. Calves tend to be one of those body parts. I know it was for me. I didn’t really see any improvement until I tried something different. I thought that I might be overtraining them, even though as a relatively small body part, it may seem you can’t. I started seeing improvement when I trained them indirectly. That is, I relied on the indirect stimulation from working other body parts, namely legs, to provide the stimulus. I still, however, occasionally train them directly, but, not as often as before. And, when I do, I vary the pointing of my toes to try to induce growth. Nowadays, I use the stimulation I get while performing aerobic work (biking or rowing) to aid my calves. In my case, using the indoor rowing machine (ergometer) with proper form indirectly works my calves. The movement almost mimics a calf raise done horizontally. While the majority of the work targets the quads, there is some calf work done at the “catch” position through the "drive" of the rowing stroke. 

Sweating is your body's way of cooling down and it has nothing to do with burning calories. If you wanted to measure that you'd look for how much and hard you're panting – that's the fat oxidising away. The amount of sweat can very a lot from person to person and not sweating during a workout is of course okay but I'd question if you'd really gone as hard as you could have. 

It will, up to a point. If you can only do 5-10 straight reps before having to break then it's still heavy enough to build decent muscle for you. Once you can do around fifteen or more in a row, however, it'll start to become decreasingly effective. 

I was in the same situation a year or so after starting working out. It just plateaued. Though I will say it's easy to think your progress has stalled, when in fact you just don't measure it. Get a caliper for your body fat, measure tape for circumferences, a scale for bodyweight, weekly photos and record that. The biggest bang for your buck is in your diet. If you haven't given it a lot of thought before you will see incredible results after cleaning it up. There's many, many ways to go about it and you'll have zealots for every one of them, proclaiming their superiority. However, they all work because they force you to control your intake and be conscious about what you eat. My recommendation would be to eat lots and lots of veggies (biggest portion of your plate) and make sure you get around 2 gram of protein per kilo bodyweight (whether that's from legumes, nuts, grains, meat or egg – that's up to you). Measure the food! Put it in a food log like MyFitnessPal. That's the only way you will know your intake and you should not skip this step. Next is exercise. If you can't squat twice your bodyweight I would switch to a beginners strength program with linear progression. My personal favorite is StrongLifts but some people like Starting Strength too. The important part here is the built-in progressional load – it keeps pushing you to lift heavier and heavier, thus helping you break through plateaus. Add in 5-10 minutes of intense Tabata as often as you feel you can still progress. Sprints, rower, skipping rope, etc. Go as hard as you can for 20 seconds and then slower for 10. Rinse and repeat. 

To ensure a proper heart rate range, I would invest in a heart rate monitor. There are several, but, since you ride a bike for the most part, you should look at a chest band with an accompanying watch. A heart rate monitor can assist you in maintaining a heart rate to reach your goals. 

Lastly, some seated row machines have a handle that would allow you vary the grip. If yours has multiple grips, I would suggest you try that. 

There's nothing wrong with the order of exercises you're currently performing. However, to avoid a training plateau, you should consider changing up your routine on a regular basis. Typically, that's every 6 to 8 weeks. For example, as you've asked, perform all chest exercises first, then biceps. Or, perform biceps first, then chest. You should base it on what you think you need improvement on so that you can perform those exercises early on in your routine. 

What you are describing is called Isometric training. It’s a little used, and much misunderstood, form of training in which the muscle tenses without changing its length. Each contraction is typically done for 6 to 10 seconds at a specific angle. For example, think of a bodybuilder holding a front double biceps pose. During a competition, poses are typically held for quite a long time. That’s why most competitive bodybuilders practice static (isometric) posing. Isometric training assists in holding a pose for a long time without shaking from muscle fatigue. While isometric training is not popular, it does have its merits as evidenced by a 2005 study titled “Strength training: isometric training at a range of joint angles versus dynamic training” by Folland JP1, Hawker K, Leach B, Little T, Jones DA. That study concluded that: 

That is very similar to the program that I have for upper body strength. My core work is done every training day though. It's usually shorter and varies depending on our trainer. So I did not devise my program. I attend a quite relaxed CrossFit gym that allows for a lot of different work to suit other goals. So abs might be 3 rds or 30 each of side plank, side plank, hollow position. Only 4.30min. Or 3 rds 10 slow GHD situps, 15 back extensions, 15 reverse hypers not for time. Probably less an 10 min total. So I would do, starting on a Monday 

Rest days usually means mobility, foam rolling and stretching. Total workload is a little less than yours. So I think your work load is OK. But I prefer having clear rest days. I definitely benefit. The workout never really changes. Fundamental upper body strength is probably very similar to fundamental leg strength (squat, squat some more). I do enjoy some of the more gymnastic work, so I sometimes throw in some handstand drills, back levers, front levers, muscle ups etc just for fun. 

Hard to say anything definite without seeing a video or pictures but I'm thinking it could be a combination of a weak core and faulty technique. Try doing the plank and back raises, without and with added weight, and see how it feels. Does it hurt similarly? As for diagnosing your form: look in a mirror to see the curvature of your back, as you're pressing. It should be pretty straight – otherwise you risk overextending and hurting your back. You can also try laying down on your back and having someone put their hand under the small of your back. Tighten your core and press down against the hand – that's the form you want to press from. If the pain is located very high up, you could experiment with your grip width. Does wider feel better than smaller? Also try to push your elbows out, so you're not pressing in front of yourself as much as straight from the sides. Hope that helps! Else please upload a video so we can check your form. Of course, if it keeps hurting I would strongly recommend also seeing a proper physio in person. 

And, since there's no definitive study to suggest that stretching the pectorals like you do adds any benefit, why risk injury? Especially since while lying flat, your shoulders and pectorals will act like levers resisting the weight and force of gravity. 

In the context of your question, it means flexing the abs so that the muscles contract without actually changing the angle or the length of the muscle. By starting the movement with an isometric contraction, you ensure that that the abs will get the maximum benefit from the exercise. Isometric contractions are typically used in rehab settings, but, can also be used for general fitness. In fact, bodybuilders use isometrics when they practice posing from a competition. It helps them to hold their poses for extend periods of time without relaxing the muscles. 

No matter what I, or anyone else recommends, in the end, your decision should be based on your pain tolerance and the risk of further serious injury. At a minimum, you should consult a professional for a proper diagnosis if you haven’t already. Having said all that, I’ve been in your situation while participating in a different sport. I chose the same modalities you have (ice and pain killers), and, it allowed me to compete. I also added stretching before and after my event(s) and made sure to get plenty of rest in between training sessions. In addition, I did find K-Tape helpful, at least psychologically, but, that may be due to the extent of my injury and its location. You may not get the same results. In the end, you’ll need to assess what competing in the event means to you in the context of a potentially chronic injury. Weigh that against taking time off to fully address an injury to prevent it from becoming chronic, and, the ability to race pain free in the future. Only you can make that choice. 

Conditioning exercises attempt to increase athletic ability and capacity, but may also help reduce the likelihood of injury. Suppose you're a marathon runner, you don't just run marathons to train. You'd do shorter runs, some strength training etc and this will improve your marathon 'ability' even though your program does not include marathons. I have no idea what the application of treading water might be. The water provides resistance, and you need to coordinate all your limbs, it's low impact, and it gets tiring, so it may have value as a general exercise. 

Ask someone at your gym for advice and to show you drills. Otherwise maintain good general fitness. Edited to try and answer the question more directly. Thought the Edit Summary field would add an editing note. Does not seem to be the case. Edited again to put edit note 

As an example, you might say: Ultimate goal Lose 20lbs by Summer 2015 Intermediate Goal: I want to be able to run until the counter says 600 calories. Current capacity: 300 calories. Intermediate-intermediate goal: Every other sessions I will increase that count by 10 calories. So say you run twice a week, try and hit 310 calories twice. If you go for 1 month you should be at 340 calories. Write down your progress and how you feel if that helps you. At the end of the month ask yourself, was that too easy? Too hard? Have you hit a plateau and need to do something else for a while? Are you on track to lose that weight? Then revise your intermediate goals and go for another month, then revise again. Be specific and realistic with your intermediate goals. If you set yourself something well beyond your ability, you may lose confidence, lose interest, get injured, over train etc. You need to be able to constantly chip away towards your goal, form good habits, and show yourself that you can in-fact push slightly beyond your perceived limits and still be OK at the end. 

Generally it's much easier to, for example, skip eating a banana than to go out jogging for fifteen minutes. Personally I feel it's even more so when your caloric deficiency is more than 500 kcal per day. This is all just anecdotal, so I'd try it out myself if I were you. But for myself I'd just do some heavy lifting to maintain muscle and then cut the bulk of the calories at the intake instead. 

I would suggest you skip the DVDs and get the StrongLifts app. It's a beginners strength program and the app makes it super easy to follow. If you're just switching to strength training I'm certain you'll see some really nice gains the coming months. Should you also want to keep your metcon up while using SL, then just throw in the odd Tabata workouts. Five minutes of intensive interval sprints will be more than enough. 

Stretch jeans! Also has the added benefit of highlighting the results of your leg work. ;) Other than that, get a pair that fits your upper legs and take them to a tailor for adjustments. 

Then you can just add variations as you get better. For example, with the first pattern, go up 2 rungs or go up in a pattern 1 - 2 - 3. When you are even stronger, go legless. A good resource is the book "Gimme Kraft". Kraft is german for strength or power. 

I am not a good runner. I am definitely not a distance runner. My foray into running styles was an exercise to manage a minor knee injury. So my running style is entirely to do with injury prevention. I've tried forefoot running, but that gave me very sore calfs. I can't say that it is wrong. I still tend to land more on my forefoot if I sprint. Still a big improvement on my legs and knees. At my gym, the trainer has adopted the Pose method. As far as I understand, this encourages a mid-foot landing. As far as comfort and injury prevention goes, this has been the best method for me. Be aware, the Pose running website is really bad and looks like a scam. But worth a try if injury prevention is your main goal.
