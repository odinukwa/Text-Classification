This touches me on a personal level for I've tried hard my whole life to get rid of my accent, only to be told time and again I still have a strong Hispanic accent. I've learned a few interesting things on the road, though: 

Chinese dictionaries have arranged characters according to radicals for several centuries, then sorting on next level according to number of strokes. Works when you're looking for the meaning or pronunciation of a character you just saw. Some dictionaries and encyclopedias also attempted sorting by "theme": animals, plants, metals, etc. Of course, works only if you know a word and are looking for how it's written. The canonical list of radicals is taken to be that used in the Kangxi dictionary, presumed to be one of the most complete dictionaries ever made on Chinese logograms: $URL$ For Japanese I can attest the problem is solved via kana: when searching the kanji for a word you know, they're ordered according to the sorting of kana (aiueo, ka ki ku...) . When you look instead for a character's meaning or its pronunciation, though, they also use the radical + number of strokes method. As a foreign learner, you're in for some surprises for some characters' official stroke steps are not what you could intuitively think of :) 

I was under the impression that all languages are considered isolates until it's demonstrated to a high degree of certainty that they're related to another language. Was I wrong on this? There've been various attempts at linking Korean to Japanese and Ainu, on one-hand, and to the Turkic-Mongolic languages on the other. Should the proponents of one of these efforts succeed, then Korean would stop being classified as an "isolate", which really means "not enough data to accurately say if it's related to something else or not". 

Clearly, NP1 "Alex" is not NP2 "himself", and NP1 "Alex" does not dominate NP2 "himself", or vice versa. But every node that dominates NP1 "Alex" (namely, the S) also dominates NP2 "himself". Therefore, NP1 "Alex" C-commands NP2 "himself". This is important, because it seems to be how reflexives work in English: the NP "Alex" C-commands the NP "him", which makes it change from "him" to "himself". But if "Alex" is buried any deeper in the tree, as in "the man who works with Alex saw him", then "Alex" no longer C-commands "him", and so no reflexive happens. 

Most users of a language will neither know nor care about an individual word's etymology. The odds that an individual native speaker of French knows that accabler comes from ad- + cata- + ball- + -ƒÅre are close to zero. They know the word for what it means, not what it used to mean. The word cata-ballein was originally Greek, as the Wiktionary entry points out. But when it was borrowed into Latin, the common everyday Latin-speakers didn't care that it had the prefix cata- already; in Latin, cata- isn't meaningful, and the whole word was taken as a single unit. Compare English "important". Very few English-speakers still see this as Latin in- + porta- + -nt + -s. You might ask "why does it still have the Latin participle ending -nt instead of the English -ing", or "why do English-speakers add prefixes like 'un-' onto a word that already has a Latin prefix", or "why does it appear as im- when a native English prefix wouldn't assimilate like that" (*). But most English-speakers would consider these questions nonsensical. "Important" is just a word like any other now; as far as English is concerned, it's a single atomic unit of meaning that can't be broken down any further. (*) In- appears as both a Romance and a Germanic prefix, from the same PIE root. But the Romance version assimilates, and the Germanic one doesn't: compare im-becile and in-bound. 

The early versions of Nicaraguan Sign Language were more or less like that - these deaf-mute people would sign sentences like "I go house Pedro", "this road not good", "I want food now" and so on. As it evolved, newer speakers have added complexity onto it: agreement between verb and object, markers for time and mood, spatial references, and so on. 

I once read there are a few other examples of sexual diglossia in the world, some other tribes in Africa and the Amazon, and they usually arise just like the Garifuna: when a bunch of men from one tribe/ethnic group pick up girls from a different one as wives, and for some reason neither group completely abandons their tongues. Some African tribes even added a 3rd language to the mix: the "warriors' language", used only by men in times of war to avoid an enemy's eavesdropper to understand a meeting on strategy or the discussions in mid-battle. 

A bit late, but may be useful. Several years ago, I read an interview in a celebrities' magazine to a Garifuna singer who was coming to Mexico. After the mandatory chat about his career, his success with his tour, last disc, etc. the interviewer complimented him about his near-perfect Spanish. To which he casually commented her "yeah, people always say we Garifuna are good for learning languages - I speak just as good English and French. I attribute it to the fact we're raised having to learn 2 languages". The reporter had never heard of the fact so pressed him to speak a bit more of it. I still recall some things of what he said, for that interview impacted me deeply: 

We've gotten into this debate as a side issue on this forum before, so let me take this opportunity to address it directly. I think we would all agree that, unlike many other subjects, language is defined by consensus and not by some objective reality. What I mean by that is, suppose that everyone in the world agreed that the Earth is flat. Would that make it flat? No. We can perform objective experiments to prove that it is round. When we are talking about science or history, it is very reasonable to say, "I have discovered Everyone is wrong, and the right answer is something else." But when it comes to language, suppose that I said, "When people say that 'me' refers to the person speaking, they are wrong. 'Me' means 'the tallest person in the room'." Well, I am simply wrong. If everyone agrees that a word has a certain meaning, than that's what it means. Some say that that's the end of the story. Definitions, grammar, all are defined purely and entirely by the consensus of the people who speak and write the language. Others say that this is part of the story, but that it is also meaningful to say that, even though usage X is more common than usage Y, Y is "better" for some reason. Perhaps it is more consistent with other usages, or Y is clear while X creates an ambiguity, etc. Personally, I think it's good and fair to say, for example, that we should resist changing the definition of a word because there is already a word with the new meaning but no good alternative with the old meaning. For example, many people today object to the use of the word "he" to refer generically to either males or females as sexist, and so instead use "they" as a singular pronoun for a person of unknown or unspecified gender. Personally I think this is a bad idea, because it loses the distinction between singular and plural, and so makes the language less robust. Or to take the example you give of the word "ain't": "ain't" has half a dozen meanings: "am not", "are not", "is not", "were not", etc. We already have perfectly good words for all of these (except "am not"). So why create a new, ambiguous word? It's a change in a direction that makes the language less clear. I think it should be resisted. You seem to be concerned about the idea of denigrating the dialect spoken by some minority of the population. On that point, I think, from the point of view of someone who wants equal recognition of his dialect, the situation is hopeless. If some minority -- oh, I should clarify that by "minority" here I don't mean an ethnic or racial minority, but a linguistic minority. This MIGHT coincide with an ethnic minority and it might not. But anyway, if a minority speak in a slang that violates the grammar rules used by the majority, then whether you define language purely by usage, or you define it by logic, either way their language will be seen as inferior. It is different from the majority, and in language majority rules, so they lose. If their grammar is less consistent and well-formed, then by logic they lose. (If some minority group had a slang that had a more well-formed and consistent grammar, the case might be ambiguous. But I've never heard of slang being more regulated than formal speech. Conceivable, but not likely.) As to a statement like, "Sanskrit is just grammatically incorrect Hindi", well, that sounds like a joke. If someone said that seriously, meaning that Sanskrit is an inferior language because it resembles Hindi but does not follow the same grammar rules, that doesn't sound like a serious argument. I don't know either language and I don't know the history of the languages, so there might be a serious comment somewhere in there about the origin and development of Sanskrit. 

I recall that in ancient Egyptian some hieroglyphs were used "markers" to resolve ambiguity or indicate a noun was a member of a special group, even though not meant to be pronounced. E.g. a beetle sign was placed after a group of signs denoting a bird's name to indicate such noun was meant to be read as a "flying entity" (i.e. really a bird's name) and not as a person's name. There were other characters used to emphasize a noun was a person's name, and names of gods and royalty were inscribed within special cartridges. Are these signs a kind of punctuation, or mere typographical conventions? Do they have a formal name? They do transmit information, furthermore, information that's not a merely a verbatim transcription of what the actual speech said but actually expands it. Similar to when some printed media add a small cross after a person's name to indicate they're dead. Emoticons play a similar role in modern electronic communications - they expand the written message, though in this way to compensate the loss of emotional information that in face-to-face communication is transmitted mostly via physical gestures, and to a lesser extent in verbal channels that are not written down: intonation, volume and pauses in the speech. 

Common knowledge of writing in a society can and does have an effect on the language structure, and it's been noted: There's this Israeli linguist (I've forgotten his name) who says so-called Modern Hebrew isn't really a Semitic language... he argues in one of his books how Chinese writing has had a profound effect in the language, by altering the way new words are created and how borrowings are adapted. I vaguely remember Saussure mentioning in a sentence in one of his books "I've been told people in Paris now pronounce the 't' in 'sept' ". I found that really odd, for I had been taught uttering "set" was THE correct way to pronounce 7 in French. So clearly Parisians of his time were adopting an artificial pronunciation based on spelling, which then was declared the standard. 

Consider modern Russian, which has six cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, and prepositional. In the first declension these are indicated for the most part by single vowels. 

This is called an "expressive loan": when a loanword is reanalyzed to fit into the patterns of the new language. If an unfamiliar, archaic, or foreign word shifts into something meaningful in the new language, such as expatriate ‚Üí ex-patriot or Alzheimer's Disease ‚Üí old-timer's disease, then that's called an "eggcorn". And if the loanword keeps its original form but is given an incorrect etymology in the new language, that's a "folk etymology". There's significant overlap between these three. 

(Transcribing all of these because my computer does not like changing text direction mid-line.) There doesn't seem to be any obvious connection between *sk(e)h‚ÇÉ-tos and ≈°ƒìdu, in form or in meaning. This is more likely just a coincidence. 

German did lose its dental fricatives early on, but not quite early enough to avoid affecting the orthography. The transition from /Œ∏~√∞/ to /t~d/ is usually considered part of the High German Consonant Shift. But this generalization can be misleading. This change did start in the same region as the other High German changes. But /Œ∏/ shifted significantly later, around the 10th century, and spread significantly farther, affecting all of the West Germanic languages except English. By this point, German had just begun to be written down. "Th" was chosen for /Œ∏/, by analogy with Greek theta (transcribed as "th" in Latin, and now pronounced /Œ∏/). So the cognate to English "think" was written thenken (modern German denken). But then /Œ∏/ disappeared from the language. With the distinction between /Œ∏/ and /t/ lost, it was no longer clear which German words should be written with "th" and which should have "t". Thus "th" appeared in some words like Thal, which originally had /d/ (compare English "dale"). A similar process in English created the "th" in "Thomas" and "Thames". Eventually this use of "th" fossilized. Words like Thal were permanently written with "th", while words like denken were permanently written with "d". In 1901 the orthography reform finally removed this distinction, replacing Thal with Tal and Thier with Tier. "Th" now survives only in proper names (Goethe) and Greek-derived loanwords (Thron). Source: I've been using Duden Online and Wright's Old High German Primer, which has good information on Old High German orthography and the consonant shift. However it was also published in 1888, so my information may be very out of date. Please correct me if so. 

For Japanese at least, both happened: sometimes the characters are used semantically, others phonetically - either according to their Chinese pronunciation (which can come from either a Northern or Southern, earlier or recent form of Chinese) or to the Japanese reading. For instance, one of the Chinese readings of the char. "origin/beginning/birth" is "hon". Now then, the Japanese word for "book" is also "hon" (don't know if its native or a Chinese/Korean borrowing). So instead of adopting the Chinese char. for "book", the Japanese use "birth/start" phonetically most of the times when they want to write "book". When char. for "now, immediately, contemporaneity" appears right before the char. for "sun/day", that specific case is a semantic usage: both together are meant to be read "ky√¥" (today). That for isolated chars. themselves. Japanese nowadays uses the chars. according to its own structure (SOV), in the very first examples of Japanese writing there's vascilation between trying to follow the S-V-O structure of Chinese or the native one. There's a lot of vacillation also regarding how to phonetically encode words in the vernacular. In A. C., Moorhouse's book "History of the alphabet" I read that something similar happened when Babylonians adopted cuneiform writing from the Summers, and then again when the Hittites adopted cuneiform from the Babylons. So, in a Hittite sample of writing, a set of chars. can be read in Hittite, in Babylon or in Sumerian, depending on context!!! 

As usual, Wikipedia has a great article regarding this. Late Medieval English used "they" in the singular when the number of possible nouns was unknown or left vague on purpose by the speaker. In most other situations, then native speakers would use "he" as generic - e.g. a dog's toy was "his toy" rather than "its", and such use was sometimes used also for subjects who could potentially be either male/female. Centuries later, when first the "Politically Correctness" movement came, and then some feminists started to deride what they deemed signs of sexism in the language, the need to get a real neuter-gender alternative to he/she resulted in expanding the use of singular they. You'll also occassionally find other words invented by some feminists ex-profeso to avoid the perceived implied otherness of the feminity, mostly in feminist literature (of course). In other languages, the most natural way to refer to a sex-less 3rd person would be to use the equivalent of "it", but in English the distinction "male/female" has become very weak over time, whereas the distinction "animate/inanimate" is still perceived in full force - so the only time "it" can be applied to humans is when they're babies or very very young children. So instead of "A young teenage almost never uses contraception when having its first sexually intimate relationship " you get "(...) their first sexual (...)", as grammatically contorted as it may seem. Some papers and writers have simply inverted the common usage of "he" as generic and instead take "she" as the generic unless maleness is needed/specified, so you get more grammatical sentences whilst avoiding perceived sexism.
