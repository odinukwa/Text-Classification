I have been having a very hard time with the English language (my first language), and no this isn't an English question as it is founded upon a philosophical concept that I doubt there are corresponding terminologies for that are readily available to people in any language discussion. If I categorize everything around me as being real, what would I call something that isn't real? I can't say not real or nothing as I am not referencing nothing. Nothing is void, null, not, but not-something or rather un-something is what it is. So unreal? But unreal also includes nothing, which I am not referencing. Something unreal could be a cartoon that never existed, never been thought of, but has the potential to exist, or never will, it isn't nothing and not real. So now I have these three things: real, nothing, unreal. Real is part of a reality, nothing is null, so unreal is part of an unreality? Unreality being a place that contains everything that isn't? Or un-is? But then comes the most frustrating part: how do I say reality, nothing, and unreality, at the same time? I could say everything, but that doesn't include nothing and un-everything. There seems to be no super inclusive terminology? 

While thinking about how the universe works and questioning it I have come to the conclusion that it might not actually sense and cannot ever make sense. It all starts with the question "Why?", you can tell me how but then there is also a why for that how answer. "The apple falls because of gravity." makes sense... but what is gravity "Gravity is caused by the curvature of space, curved by matter/energy." but the further and further you go the more and more specific it becomes. Until you reach this question "Why not anything else?"... so now you could suggest a multiverse with every possible configuration and thats why its so specific... but then you have to ask "How does this multiverse work and why does it exist"... then "Why can't nothing exist everywhere and there not be a multiverse?" and finally a more abstract one "Why can't space be made of yarn and math not be able to exist in this universe?"... The only thing that would fundamentally make sense would be nothing at all, literally. If nothing existed it would make more sense. But then you have to ask "Why can't there be something"... Its a question with no answer that completely destroys the very goal of making sense of everything at a fundamental scale. So the only way out is to acknowledge that our universe isn't based on the question why and that asking for a sensible answer isn't the right question to ask in the first place. That everything in the biggest and smallest picture just doesn't make sense. Which is hard to grasp and I am unsure of it being the right conclusion to this simple question. 

Obviously this will largely be opinion, but my answer is yes. If we are referring to physically interacting with the past (even so much as breathing the air in an open field) then history will be changed from the one that spawned the original "you." Simply breathing the air exposes the past to your "future" virii/bacteria. Even assuming no people are around, there are plenty of living things that may prove an effective host. If you actually are around people, infection rates go up wildly (think Small Pox vs the Native Americans). Even bacteria thought harmless to you could reek havoc on past populations. Another example would be your natural bodily functions interacting with the environment. The food you eat while in the past is no longer there to be eaten. It seems like an inconsequential thing, but that means someone may now go hungry, might get food poisoning when they wouldn't have (or NOT get food poisoning), or have their daily activities significantly altered to procure food for you (or food for themselves to replace the food eaten by you). Even if you bring your own food, that is additional matter entering the environment (packaging, feces, et cetera) that wasn't there before, and could impact the past in a similar manner. Physically travelling into the past is wrought with "butterfly effect" issues. No matter how careful you are, it is likely going to make the future you left different than the one you return to. 

Knowledge is a label for the electrical/chemical status of particular elements of the brain. That brain state is the physical manifestation, but -since we don't typically observe any of that directly- humans generally identify with the experience of 'knowing' something instead of the physics of it. Compare to 'happiness,' which is a similar label for what happens to the body under the influence of particular hormones. Or anger. Or a decision. The physical manifestation of these things are arcane, and do not lend themselves to easy understanding in context of day-to-day life. People had created these labels (and spent thousands of years philosphizing and debating over them) before we had any notion of the neuro-chemistry from which they spring. 

It is possible to know a very limited set of things with absolute certainty, i.e. not dependent on basic fundamental assumptions that "could" end up being wrong. For instance, things I am absolutely certain about: 

It sounds like you're referring to the "Law of Cause and Effect," which tells us that every material effect has a prior cause. I counter that your question is an example of special pleading, suggesting that everything requires a cause, except for this super special uncaused cause which started everything. Either every "cause requires a cause" or "not every cause requires a cause." Either all causes were caused by a prior event, meaning the uni-multi-ultraverse model you propose is perpetual, or not every cause requires a prior cause which means there is no need for a special snowflake "initial cause" needing to "choose" to start things off. Anyway, modern science (and the Law of Cause and Effect) only offer models for how reality operates in our present universe. As such, it does not (necessarily) apply before our universe existed, and may not have even applied during the initial moments after the big bang. Our scientific models of the universe do not speak to how things worked before the big bang, and currently the only thing we know about things before planck time are that things certainly did NOT operate according to the same rules ($URL$ 

I take your term "conceptual" to really be getting at representational, where information is really being represented and "deliberated" on. Allow me to give some examples: Many studies show (as Dreyfus argues in many papers) that skilled labor actually occurs in a non-representational fashion. For example, a chess-master need not consciously deliberate on the "best" or most "rational move" in order to play well. In fact, this conscious deliberation causes people who engage in skilled labor to become more inept than they normally are. To take a mundane example, when I see someone who is angry, I don't need to actively represent some information about anger to verify that a person is indeed angry. There is some complexity that goes into this, and I would recommend a paper called "Intelligence Without Representation," that talks about being-in-the-world and maximum grip theory very succinctly. By contrast, even Dreyfus admits to the fact that some representation does occur. For example in self-reflection or the rational deliberation of a particular belief/propositional attitude (i.e How many people are in the U.S? should people gamble?) However, some such as Richard Moran argue that even though information is being represented, our primary means of introspection is non-inferential/non-perceptual/immediate, meaning that propositional attitudes are actually self-constituted by introspection. To complicate things further, take one of the tenets of the somatic marker hypothesis, which argues that some of our emotional states are actually a conscious or unconscious representation of a particular emotional body state, suggesting that some parts of phenomenal consciousness. Similarly, if part of our conscious deliberation is based on emotional content, then some parts of prop. attitudes might actually be non-representational. Needless to day, any argument that floats around "fully conceptual" would be facile in its approach without addressing the concerns of many, many philosophers. From an intuitive perspective, it's hard to believe that every decision we make is some rational deliberation of evidence (for example. every step you take in a particular direction) but it also feels strange to admit to the fact that all decisions don't depend on some so-called "conceptual content" or informational representation. This is ignoring mind-extension theory, how conceptual content might alter phenomenal experience (vice versa), causal pathways in the mind, potential metaphysical reduction, self-knowledge (what kind of "concepts" exist?) and so forth. There is a lot going on, so it is a difficult question to answer in this kind of format. I would suggest starting with that Dreyfus essay. Perhaps Moran's "Authority and Estrangement," some Ned Block David Chalmers etc., perhaps some literature on the somatic marker hypothesis. It sounds like you would also enjoy donald davidson's "mental states" and Charles Taylor. 

I second the above mention of "Descartes' Error" by Antonio Damasio, although the fundamental argument has been more succinctly stated in other places. "Mental Events" by Donald Davidson is an excellent essay, arguing for metaphysical reduction of the mind, by way of explanatory non-reduction (it is genius.) "What is it like to be a bat?" by Thomas Nagel is an absolutely foundational essay on the explanatory gap. "On Confusion About a Function of Consciousness" by Ned Block is also prerequisite reading for most modern philosophy of mind. Although you were very explicit about this, Dennett has some excellent literature on constructing an objective phenomenology, that is very interesting. Finally, Richard Moran has an entire novel out called "Authority and Estrangement," that deals with the asymmetry of self knowledge and knowledge of other types, and "privileged access" to some parts of our minds. Self-knowledge actually has some import in terms of whether or not the mind can be reduced. I can recommend other essays. Are you interested at all in functionalism? 

Given your reply to #4, I'd label you as a person regardless of your personal feelings on the matter. You can call yourself a dog, a duck, or the Queen of England if you like, but being 99.99999999997% human means the 'human' label is most appropriate in my assessment. I wouldn't mind also supporting your claim to the dog label. You obviously feel it applies to you, and having been born a dog does support it. 

Assumes the cost of feigning belief is negligible Assumes penalties for non-worship are worse than those for worshiping the "wrong" deity Assumes "god" doesn't (or can't) differentiate between those with true belief versus those who are just hedging their bets Assumes "god" does not reward intellectual honesty 

Difference between science knowledge and religious knowledge? Scientific Knowledge: A set of models which may be used to explain and predict the the universe around us. Includes the process necessary to verify and add to that body of knowledge. Understanding the world around us, and the underlying rules which governs it, is paramount. Religious Knowledge: Generally, the memorization, understanding, and strategies for adherence to a set of tenants and/or moral rules (usually) connected to the belief in a specific deity or enlightened being. Belief that everything in the world is operating within a divine plan of some sort is typical. This type of knowledge is often focused on how best best to remain in compliance with these tenants, and apply them to day-to-day existence. 

Alternatively, there are several books on the subject of mixing atheism and religious tradition, as well as several organizations (such as Atheists for Jesus) which support following religious traditions without belief in a deity. 

Republican party stances are primarily determined by the political favors their major donors demand, while paying lip service to the "conservative" portion of the U.S. population. Democratic party stances are primarily determined by the political favors their major donors demand, while attempting to maintain the facade of caring about the common good and "liberal" ideals. 

tl;dr - Scientific knowledge is concerned with how the world works now, and reliably predicting how it will operate in the future. Religious knowledge assumes the existence of a some manner of greater being, and is focused on determining/acting according to it's will. When we have reached the limits of our (current) scientific knowledge, people often rely upon Religious knowledge rather than saying, "I don't know." 

It seems some great answers have been given, but just to add something else: Regardless of whether a scientific theory is later proven to be incorrect, the data and testing that previously supported that theory are still just as correct and useful. It is just our interpretation of that data which is brought into question. I feel this is important to mention, because I have often heard people mention that science's practice of regularly tossing out previously held beliefs means that it is inconsistent and untrustworthy. If tomorrow, the theory of gravity was proven to not be accurate in describing some newly discovered phenomenon, that does not make it any less accurate at describing the things it used to. It is no longer an all encompassing framework that can be used, but that doesn't change the fact that 99.9% of what it states remains true.
