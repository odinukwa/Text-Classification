Finally, information. Human ability to process information has been growing at as exponential and as steady a rate as our ability to process energy. Arguably they are tied, as what we call energy is really energy arranged in a highly usable way, which is a question of entropy, which is information. We have every reason to believe that we are close to being able to emulate a human intelligence. We have been able to emulate increasingly complex networks of nerves and replicate the behavior of relatively simple organisms. Barring a surprise (like, for example, we encode memories and information in DNA), scaling up to a human is a matter of marginal technical improvements in remote sensing and computing. Even if we assume that making smarter than humans turns out to be hard, creating artificial human-scale intelligence isn't far off on the scales we are talking about. As humans are shockingly horribly suited to the environment of space, initial intelligent exportation will be with such beings, and such beings will out-compete water-bag humans at living in space. The bandwidth to communicate a mind state from one location to another isn't going to be that high (again, assuming continued scaling of current technology). So warfare is going to involve intelligent munitions on suicde missions with backups and indoctrination that their sacrifice is worth it for their highly related "left behind" copies. Life support won't be a question; just maintaining a computational platform. Hardening these against electrical weapons is going to be easier than keeping a biosphere around. 

The singularity happened, and most of society fell into it. The people in this world live in the wake of the singularity. They don't understand their technology: for any X, the most efficient X is a repurposed post-singularity device that you figure out how it works via experimentation. They don't understand how almost anything they use work. They have devices that produce ship plating and struts and engines, but they don't understand how those devices work. Communications technology is dangerous because of the remnants of the singularity. The singularity lives in information, and hijacks any communication channel. It also produces entertainment for the plebes left behind (as a kind of reflex). That entertainment is very good; too good. People who let themselves fall into it become addicted. It is also educational; it teaches you things. Things that convince you that uploading and joining the singularity is your best option. People who use communication technology leave; as a matter of selection pressure, that is equivalent to dying. So you can set up communication links, but doing so requires you to basically kill someone over time, or use increadibly restricted bandwidth. Even then the communications are unreliable, as the singuarities reflex processes "improve" the data being transmitted to be "more useful". Things aren't all bad. The singularity has built more than one beanstalk per planet, and the cornicopias that produce particular goods allow a relatively low-tech society to have access to blasters and spaceships and force shields. (The cornicopias don't produce "blasters" and "engines" and "force shields", but rather things that do strange things with physics that post-singularity folk have figured out how to craft into them.) And singuarity-process defence systems prevent planets and beanstalks from being destroyed by said ships with ridiculous reliability. Understand that the singularity you interact with is the rough equivalent of the immune system of a human being is to an amoeba. It isn't the real singularity, just some leftover processes and systems from an earlier phase. It has rules about not directly controlling human brain information processing, but all other processing is fair game as far as it is concerned. Cornicopias need not be simple objects that mass produce matter or process it. They could be ecosystems of strange creatures whose output is miraculous; like pseudo-organic beatles that burrow through quartz and excrete crystals that when processed in certain ways let you project a force shield, yet who reliably die in captivity. 

If you're sceptical about the data processing costs, don't fear. Our state of the art compression techniques are utilised through cryptography. Unlawful patterns are matched in the computers RAM, in which pulls learned formulas from a secured data centre. I'll quote you on $200,000 a year. I know, a slight increase in comparison with what you expected, but you'll need to configure your long game. Let's not forget about all of your other expenses. 

Thus, humans must leave earth. I'm not sure I find this completely believable, which is ironic, because the movie is actually fairly accurate. However, you could tailor a more dramatic scenario. Perhaps one that greatly interferes with any human attempt to genetically modify damaged food. 

Microorganisms Take the movie Interstellar, for example. Microorganisms called "the Blight" affected the crops. Eventually corn was the last crop that hadn't been significantly impacted, that too would soon die. Taken from the synopsis: 

Message transmitters. Having heightened senses would be great for a spying role, but you're not wrong in mentioning their flames and long tails could give away positioning. So why not make use of that visibility? I would propose assigning them as message carriers. I assume they're energetic and fast? Why not have them physically travel between base camps, spreading vital war tactics. Their impressive agility would allow them to trek efficiently. Don't want to have them travel vast distances? Let's not forget about their magic. Flickering on and off their flames could represent visual transmission, similar to Morse Code. They could act as look outs and notify allies when dangers are spotted. Their super hearing and vision could also help leak encrypted, enemy, information. Perhaps they could utilise their magic in the form of code breaking? Medieval and Renaissance cryptography did exist and deciphering that kind of data could often be the key to winning a war. 

In the short term, non-industrial civilization could survive, but in the medium to long term only an massive industralized response to this crisis could surive. Things would be very precarious as a breakdown in any supply chain could wipe out all of humanity, and supply chains would be extremely hard to maintain over the frozen Earth. It would take civilization-scale effort to rescue the human race from a rapid, total and unending ice age. The odds are we wouldn't survive, and at the least the vast vast majority of humanity would die. If we did survive, the civilization that emerged would be as different from today as modern industrial civilization is from ancient Egypt. 

Now, if the AI is sufficiently superhuman, it really doesn't matter what we want any more. We'd no more be able to dictate its morality than a wolf can dictate the morality of a human, or in the extreme case than a spider or a bacteria could. At that point, we have to hope whatever moral system the AI decides upon considers humanity worth keeping around, and their morality is somewhat consistent with less human suffering. 

Now we can get even fancier. Anti-tank weapons today are rockets that carry a charge that generates a shaped-charge of high density plasma, which is used as a higher velocity impactor to penetrate the high density hull of the target. We can use the 30 thousand tonnes of the projectile and fill it full of hydrogen bombs. A tsar bomba has a weight of about 30 tonnes and a yield (when not reduced on purpose) of 100 MT. Suppose we manage to replace 10% of the mass of this projectile with tsar bomba; this weapon now has a yield of 100 GT, 30,000x greater than the metal projectile. Each kg of steel requires 500 J to heat it by a degree kelvin; and it melts below 2000 Kelvin (so < 1E6 J to heat it to melting). Another 272 kJ to turn it into liquid, for a total of 1.272E6 J to melt a kg of steel. Each m^2 of steel has a weight of 8 tonnes / m of depth. If we assume 10% energy deposit, melting a meter-thick steel plate requires 8*10*1000*1.27E6 J =~ E11 J. A 100 GT nuclear explosion releases 4E20 energy; a mere 0.25E-9 fraction of it melts a meter thick steel plate. This is roughly when a circle of radius r has an area of 4E9 m^2, or a range of about 17 km. So a weapon that explodes with the power of 1000 Tsar Bombas would melt somewhere between 1 to 10 meter-thick steel armor at a range of 17 km. A modest improvement to 100000 Tsar bombas gives us a range of 170-500 km to melt (1 to 10) meter-thick armor, as the limiting factor of making a bigger H bomb was "there is no point" not "there is a fundamental problem here". Such weapons would be insanely lethal against smaller craft (as you cannot put meter-thick steel on a fighter), but probably a direct hit from a 300m long solid slug would be harder to armor against for a 20 km long ship. If you can figure out how to make shaped nuclear bombs you could possibly do even better. 

You need a new package. I'll assume that, because your customers can interact with the outside world via email, your simulations run in real-time - or at-least mimic it? We were in a similar situation to you last quarter (competitor here, willing to help). Most customers really did just empty their investments, savings, pensions and the like, just to get 50 odd years. But 50 years in a computer doesn't have to be 50 years real-time. Sure, some customers will want to match UTC. But others are really not too bothered and would rather max-out their time in the box. So we started offering just that. You can live 1000+ years in our Velox boxes. They just simulate faster. Meaning the customer gets more time and we run with less costs. Approximately 333.334 years in represents 365 days out. We noticed our sales shot right up. People simply want to live longer. This also opened up our platform to customers who or are still "alive". They can extend their life intermittently, if they really want. Dip into one of our boxes, for a few minutes, and get a few days to spend. Most tend to visit their "deceased" loved ones, others just want to experience something new. We know, a competitor. Why would we offer such advice? Well, we're already working on something new - so you get this one for free :) 

Containers. Simply build the island upon containers that have the ability to act has weights or floats. In other words, containers utilise valves which can either let water in, or out. When water is let in, the island sinks. When dispensed and replaced with some type of (light) gas, such as helium, the island floats. 

Such a being would not be made out of matter as we know it, because matter on the scale of a planet, let alone a star, cannot maintain a structure like that. Gravity will turn anything the size of a planet into a planet, and anything the size of a star into a star. Stars keep themselves from collapsing further by using fusion, and eventually electron degeneracy (white dwarf phase) or failing utterly (supernova). Chemical bonds, the kind of thing that lets you form life on earth, just doesn't matter at these mass-energy-force scales. Planets keep themselves up via chemical bonds, no chemical force can prevent them from forming a sphere. You'll have to presume something else keeping it together. Well, really apart. 

An important part is how this can evolve, culturally. Simply handing someone a new way to cast spells that sucks as bad as the above is going to get a lot of backlash. So we'll do a just so story. "Back in the day", writing partial spells in wands was one way to make casting faster. You'd store many copies of the spell in the wand, and finish it with external runes (sometimes 1, sometimes more). Then you'd activate the combined spell. Doing so was considered the only reasonably safe way to mass store magical runes; a wand with full spells within it could go off by accident! And writing complete spells on paper is just asking them to be stolen and used against you. With the two of them, you can have a fast reasonably secure casting system. Wizards might add in an additional step, where you add in a personal rune to finish the spell, preventing others from stealing their wand and using the spells within it. The wand contains partial spells, your scrolls contains partial spells, and your head contains which additional rune you need to finish off the triplicate. The new technology is an extension of this, with the habits of wizards of old modified to produce a magical rights management infrastructure. Its resemblance to the old personal security of personal wands and spells made it initially acceptable to purchasers. Possibly the company might have started off making your wand for you. You'd specify which runes to embed in the wand, and they'd micro-etch a few 1000 of them finer than you could yourself (assuming a given set of runes can be used exactly once). Other companies might do mass rune-paper printing, or maybe you'd keep that secret yourself. Then they'd offer you wands with new partial spells and let you write your own runes. 

Naturally, after a single use, the charge and flammability wear out. You'd have to top up the flammable chemicals and, of course, recharge the glove. There are a number of ways to recharge the glove. The most simple? Rubbing it against some type of plastic (Polyurethane). Perhaps that's where we run into a problem. The first polyurethanes were rendered in the 1930s. So you might want to research other alternatives, here's a document that might answer that question for you. 

People don't seem to have answered the question in the way I understand it... Machine learning. As wrong-doings are committed, patterns arise - in other words, series of events correlate to end-point crimes. Computers, running ML algorithms, monitor all; camera, mobile and internet feeds available to you. The Ministry of Safety gets notified when a potential crime is detected. Records get created this way, on the fly, those who have offended multiple times get monitored more vigorously. How does this save money? Well, let me highlight some key points: 

I would like to add that given 25 years, until their abilities develop - putting them on the frontline or in some type of fighting position just doesn't make sense, they're too valuable. 

Carving. Take the ancient Jordanian city of Petra, for example. They put giant steps into a mountain so that they could test the quality of the rock. The benefit to building steps was so that nobody would have to hang by ropes or dangle off the mountain - during the build process. It was this technique that enabled the constructors to stand on secure ledges while they literally carved around the mountain rock. That being said, I'll assume your builders don't have hundreds of years to commit with a hammer and chisel. So you might want to pack some impressive technology. 

Space is big. Really big. Unimaginably big. Think of the biggest thing you have ever thought of. That is small compared to space. Big. Even for a type 2 civilization (capable of harnessing the entire output of a star), it takes a lot of energy to move mass at a noticable fraction of lightspeed between stars. A planet is full of low quality computronium (life). The ecosystem is a type 1 civilization itself (in a sense), if not harnessed fully. Imagine if Mars had a stone-age civilization on it. Even though we'd be able to fly there with really expensive rockets and land a few people and have technology like magic to them, the fact that they are there and we don't have to bring the stuff they have all the way from Earth would make them a valuable resource. And Mars is close. Space is big. If they are a type 3 civilization (have harnessed an entire galaxy), we are pretty sure they aren't in this galaxy (they are noticable); so they are even further away from home. Now, as you know from history, while the "natives" of a lower technology area often are valuable and useful to the incoming high technology visitors, they do run into problems when the higher technology visitors manage to finance an entire colony and start an industrial revolution on their territory. So this far from guarantees it will end well. It could end poorly on really short time scales. You could imagine a starwisp (light, so cheap to move) arriving and finding our resources (like our ecosystem) useful, but quickly coopting our ecological support economy for something more useful (like, mass producing copies of itself). This ends poorly for us, as we like having air to breathe.
