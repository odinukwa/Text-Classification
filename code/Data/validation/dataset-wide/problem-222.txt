There is something in the water : There is some chemical substances in the main water source of the city that has the effect of making everyone who drinks enough water to sleep during the day rather than the night, the minority who doesn't sleep during the day are the ones who drink much less water, maybe because they live far away from the city's main water source, or maybe they suffer from dehydration. 

Practicing Sports with your fancy shoes : One way to demonstrate that you are wealthy is to practice sports while wearing your fancy shoes instead of regular sports shoes. In that case you will prove that you are too rich to not care about your fancy shoes getting worn by playing sports. Avoid walking on pedestrian passages and walk on rough unattended roads : Yes you are rich enough to torture yourself by walking on rocky roads just to prove that you are much superior than the others. That doesn't make sens but it will definitely get your shoes worn. 

This is somewhat vaguely related to a old question of mine involving a alien species who spend three thousand years developing a post singularity spaceship armada in the mantle of a lava planet (Industrious). I try being realistic. So realistic that I figured that might somehow not work as planned. My logic at the time was so sound too! "Can't hide in space because of heat signature? Well, let's find some extremely hot place and hide in it where looking for heat signatures is impossible and no one will look anyways". Turns out trying to make a massive underground base in a lava planet has lots of problems. Problems that you can only throw so much technology at. So I wonder. Where in the galaxy is a safe place to hide from some genocidal spaceship entities who wanna kill everyone? And I mean anywhere in the galaxy. Empty space is not a option, too easy to be seen. Cold planets I presume would be useless because of the lack of heat. However, where in the Milky Way galaxy is a safe place to hide from swarms of genocidal aliens that kill anything they detect on sight while building a giant space fleet? -Will a lava planets work? -What about a hot jupiter? -What about near the galactic center? -Are globular or open clusters good or do they come with problems like being too much of landmarks? -Do red dwarfs or brown dwarfs hide things well enough or are they too cold to hide heat signatures? Technological limits are very few here, but hyper-spatial options aren't available. FTL speeds are around 10-20 Ly per day. Wormholes would require moving to other star systems if used. 

Radar, even from close orbit, won't detect something a mile underground. Neither will a camera for that matter. Even if close range radar could detect an underground facility, you would have to know where to look. The larger the scanning "beam" the lower the sensor resolution will be - so you have to figure out what your lowest acceptable resolution is. For pinpointing targets from orbit, you're probably talking about a beam size of 1-mile diameter or less (guessing). For a planet the size of earth, using naive math, that's a surface area of 4.92403 x 107 (e.g. it will take longer than you want to scan for the target). Like I said, that is naive math (surface area of a circle with an earth-like diameter). But a planet is a sphere so the farther from perpendicular to the surface you are, the more distortion you will encounter. That means you have to constantly be readjusting the position of the ship. Burying facilities is how governments today hide things. At long range, see #1. At short range, precise targeting becomes an option. We like to imagine that the modern media's claims are true that a simple green laser pointer can blind a pilot in an airplane. Imagine what a relatively low-power, planetary wide, laser grid could do to an approaching ship's camera systems. The effects could be anything from a simple obscuring (blindness) to destruction (burning or overloading the sensor). Artificial methods of obscuring a target, such as chaff in the air, would just be a beacon. "Look! Something is hidden over here, don't look over here." 

As a bonus question, would there be a difference if the Titanian was radiation resistant or would the results be the same? I ask since I am not really certain how to predict any of this. 

Splashed with water Exposed to the heat Touched by a human or stabbed by one (in the latter case- do they bleed or does their blood boil away?) 

Not sure which one would be the most logical or thematic, but the general idea should be the same. A currency that has its weight not in gold, but in a celestial object of arbitrarily defined importance. The issue is I have no clue if using a cosmic object as a currency weight would actually work in practice given the expansionist nature of my human civilization. Since I am not really good at economics, can anyone who knows their economics tell me what unintended implications of this idea may entail given the scenario and/or celestial object used? I'm not completely sure where to look. *Detail: The "special particle" in question is called the "Lux Particle". It exists only in the corona of stars and must exist in plasma. Lux Particles allow ships to not only have FTL, but also fast-as-light travel and teleportation for spaceships. Brighter stars have more lux. I might have intentionally devised lux as a way to screw red dwarves over. 

Just to answer part of the question - shielding - as other's have stated, shielding an entire planet is not practical. Also, you only describe the technological level of the sensors, not the defending planet. That could make a huge difference in how shielding is handled. Also, others have mentioned that cameras and radar are the most likely candidates for sensors. I agree. Here's a couple extra thoughts... 

In conclusion it seems like if you want to hide something on a planet from being observed by a ship - choose a location where it is often cloudy and dig a big hole. Let math and physics handle the rest. 

Watchtowers : Put watchtowers in every city, they provide a military advantage especially inside the city's walls : 

They are using advanced high-tech tools in order to get their job done, however under the new regime of the US government, scientists and engineers are being treated like slaves and forced to work for a cheap payement since it's their duty towards their ruling government. Advantages : The main good thing that could work in benefit of his conspiracy that the miners are poor and underpaid by the government so they are angry with their condition, also they are not traveling in cryostat (they are not sleeping) because they have to refine those materials before delivering to earth. Important : He needs to get rid of all the soldiers (kill them and burn them or send them to the nearest rock in escape pods) before reaching Saturn and also get rid of the ship after taking all of the cargo, because the person in charge of the Chinese space colony can't protect our infamous hero from the Chinese government in case he brings back anything representing the US government (a proof of the mutiny). Question : According to Wikipedia : 

top my list of insane energy producers. Then the magical robots have a gravity-to-energy converter. Gravity isn't an issue because the converter basically consumes it during the conversion process. Robots powered by micro-singularities would be awesome! 

What if Fran were a water-based creature with either some control of her physical structure or some kind of inherent structure. All her sensory organs are inside her outer boundary, including her "eyes". The eyes see everything in a 360-degree disc (or possibly 360-degree sphere). Possibility 1: Her locomotion is fluid-like.. so a flowing mechanism. Traveling "downhill" is quite easy for her. Traveling "uphill" is easier than side to side because she leaves a moist trail in her wake. Traveling over moist surfaces is easier for her than dry surfaces. Possibility 2: Alternatively, because of the nature of her sight, this liquid-like creature only perceives the world as "forward". So while Fran can move as easily as you or I on a two-dimentional plane, whatever direction she's traveling is always forward to her. There are many ways to structure a city for this kind of Fran. If you go this direction I'm sure you will have fun exploring the possibilities. 

In Greek mythology, Zeus is capable of striking the enemies with giant meteorites, inflicting a devastating damage. 

Effects in medicine : It will be a controversial healing method, something like suicide assessment in hospitals where you need to sign an agreement or a paper that you accept this healing method and that you are fully aware of its drawbacks on your health in the future. It's something the doctor can't decide, only the patient will choose whether to accept it or not. Effects in warfare : Soldiers are expendables when it comes to winning a battle, so when a soldier falls in a fight he will be healed immediately using this method whether he liked it or not, of course this will enhance the chances of winning the war, but after many years the number of recruits will diminish because people will become afraid, not from death, but from painful death by cancer. Effects in society : People will mostly riot against this healing method, since many religions forbid suiciding, and this healing method is literally a suicide, so it will not be welcomed by everyone, and society will incriminate every mage who practices this sort of healing (talking about burning mages at the stake).
