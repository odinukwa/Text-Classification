Are there any Suttas that explain how to deal with (unexpected) life obstacles? It seems that in this regard Buddhism seems to be a bit passive? I might be wrong. 

From a Cognitive Behavioural point of view Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) might help. The whole idea is to expose yourself gradually. So you deliberately either postpone the very thing you supposedly cannot bear or you expose yourself to the problem. If one is obsessed by checking the stove one replaces that with an helpful and realistic self statement like "Okay, I feel now these uncomfortable feelings and they are hard to bear but I if I am honest with myself I can bear them and it's worth bearing because (...)" and at the same time acts the opposite, but be aware that it might be better to do that gradually instead of all in one chunk (flooding). Now many therapists (among that Albert Ellis is one proponent of that) support the idea of flooding, however, do it with caution. Rather do "challenging but not overwhelming", because in the end it's all about long term change and also the motivation and courage to do face your fears. If one floods just one time it's barely going to work and it can be quite unpleasant too, so be aware! From a psychological viewpoint Emotions, congitions and behaviour are all in a reciprocal relationship. If you change one the other two will follow. Now, many circles say "change your thinking, change your thinking", but this alone might not always help because the conviction in the older belief is just too strong. So, one needs to think and act differently simultaneously. This is also why clinical depressed person are not treated with cognitive interventions (alone), because they usually don't work on highly depressed persons. If one thinks "I'm too weak to get up" questioning that might help in a person who isnt depressed but if one is depressed one needs to gently and compassionately (!) force himself to repeatedly get up in order to convince himself that the former belief was erroneous. I'm quite new to Buddhism and I like it a lot and I cannot give you "the" buddhist answer but what I can give you is a good method by Dr. Dryden which might be even somewhat similar to the idea of reflecting on the disadvantages tvat was endorsed by the Buddha, let me start: 

In simple terms: Precepts = refraining from actions. My understanding is that the 5 Precepts not only helps us from creating negative karma (Kamma = intention + actions) but also helps us in cultivating a foundation to release our attachment to the 5 Skandhas. (Actions being external factors of attachments.) To your question: [My question is how fair or correct to narrow third precept to sexual misconduct or adultery?] <--- I do not see any bits of "unfair" or "incorrectness" to limit sexual misconduct to the third precept. No matter in Theravada or Mahayana, they have given numerous examples and conditions on what is considered as Sexual Misconduct and inappropriate actions. And the range of stuff is very wide. [Does over-thinking violate third precept because its a misconduct of mind due to uncontrollable and misuse mind?] <--- No. The 5 precepts corresponds to actions only. Over-thinking is addressed through training the mind. A method of training one's mind is to observe how they arise from the 3 poisons: Greed, Hate, Ignorance, and then apply respective antidotes (Generosity, Loving-kindness, and Wisdom). This training is obviously the core teachings of the Buddha, i.e. the 4 noble truths and 8 folds paths. 

All relationships are subject to impermanence, just like all illusions. Also, the way you perceive a relationship, will always differ to the other person within that particular relationship. The relationship is merely 'true' only within your perception, which is also impermanent, just like an illusion. 

You will have to be very distinct whether your attachment is towards: 1. Your positive influence to the world; 2. Your reward, no matter big or small; 3. Your egotistic sense of success; and/or 4. Your self/improvement, enlightenment, etc. If you are towards 1-3, you are not achieving enlightenment. If you feel you are towards 4 but you are not reducing any suffering, you are not achieving enlightenment either. Remember, enlightenment is not just about letting go, but void of suffering. Are you following the 4 noble truths? and the 8 folds paths in what you do? And by the way, egoistic achievement is NOT necessary for progress in science and technology. You can say it is a motivation for some people, but it is not the only possible motivation. Therefore, the "individualistic roots" are neither permanent nor necessary. 

According to the Dhamma, is it allowed to critisize someone in a constructive manner? If someone gossips about me how do I deal with it? Compassion and kindness aside, sometimes it is necessary to be assertive. One can only be compassionate if one is healthy inside in that moment in time. Intention is a little bit more important than the act itself, (isnt it- at least in Buddhism) (only in a few instances is the act more important than the intention for example stealing is wrong even if one's family is poor), however, if for example I slice my bread in the supermarket and I see remaining pieces of bread in the machine and I take them with me because no one did I then so no reason why I would largely violete the "not taking what is not given". Sure, it wasn't given but if my attention or thought is: "Well, if I don't take it it will be wasted" then that should rather influence my kamma, right? So it's largely about my intention. If I hurt someone out of compassion because he attacks someone and injures them severely I have better results because my intention was to safe others, correct? 

I would believe not even one answer unless one makes the experience for oneself. Be even skeptical that Nirvana exists, for there is no real evidence unless one is experiencing it. Just because the Buddha said it "exists" doesn't make it so. All people answer as if they are enlightened or made the experience .. hell as if they are expert on this field but they are not. If nirvana really exists it must be possible to see it under a fmri. Why? If one really abandoned greed, hatred and delusion one can expose the "enlightened" person with evocative material to see whether any greed, hatred or delusion appears in the brain. I'm positive that there will. 

Your Karma, good or bad, will depend on how you treat, raise, and teach your child. It is What you do with him/her, that will result in good/bad/neutral karma. Hence, by just bringing a child into the world, it is neither a good or bad karma, it is neutral. 

If you have owned a pet bird before, you will understand the fact that birds cannot be enslaved in any ways. You can only tame a bird, not enslave. 

Karma will result from 'Intention' + 'Action'. basically, any action will form karma, and intention behind will increase the strength of karma. Intention itself will also cause Karma. Therefore: A) Karma will result. B) Karma will result. C) Karma will result. D) Karma will result. In Buddhism, there is no such thing as "Payment" of karma through guilt. You will experience the Karma (good or bad) as long as you created it. If you realized something you did was wrong, learn from it, refrain from repeating it, and do something about it if still possible. No one has a "say" about the strength of your karma, as Karma itself is a manifestation of natural universal laws. No one can tamper with universal laws. Not even the Gods. 

The cause to your biases, speculation, stereotyping, jumping to conclusions,.....are your strong attachments to Impermanence. To cure this, you must Recognize the "Nature of impermanence". Once you did, your biases, speculation, stereotyping....will cease to exist, for they are also impermanent. 

Analyze it with a "Cause and Effect" rule. Once you find out the cause, analyze what are the root causes and why your negative minds are being triggered. Ask yourself some of these questions: Is it only you that are experiencing the Anger, or both? If both, is there some fundamental difference that can never be settled? If only you are experiencing this mind state, try position yourself in his/her shoes? Do your family members know? what are their thoughts? Is there a win-win solution? 

I am not sure whether I got your question completely. But finding means you are anxious, aren't you. You keep looking when you find something. But when you focus on right now.. live in the moment.. you stop finding and you will no longer have that anxiety. You are at peace and you let the finding find you. Everything comes to you at the perfect time and you keep calm and accept rather than chasing things... 

I think it is your responsibility to stay calm. But first listen carefully, because maybe the person is telling you the truth in an aggressive way. So if he/she is telling the truth, accept it. If not, ignore and stay calm. There is no reason to feel angry. 

If it is a large amount of money and if you feel that they would do it to other people as well, it is better to inform the police. However, it is very important to forgive and forget whether you go to the police or not because your inner peace is more important than anything else. 

Doubts mean that you are looking at the same problem in different angles... isn't' that so. For example, 

The truth is everyone is suffering. But Physicists have that scientific explanation of how we suffer. For example, a normal person may have the understanding that most of us end up being with the similar type of people. A Physicists may describe this how waves with the same frequency synchronize as we all are a bunch of waves (our body, mind... everything). Therefore, actually, a Physicist who is passionate about suffering may suffer less as he/ she understands the core and try to find a solution to the main cause. 

Is something along those lines somewhere to be found in? I am aware of the drawbacks mentioned in MN.19 , but could this way of thinking, that is, the shortness of pleasure not lead to isolation/life rejection? The Buddha frequently used the word dispassion towards the world, but I HIGHLY DOUBT HE HAD AVERSION to worldly things. This is a common phenomenom that many monks also display ,that is, that they feel aversion to the world. How does one deal with such a (mind) problem to not to drift into negativity to wordly affairs? 

Warren, what is your intention in practising "mindfulness"? There is nothing wrong with thinking especially when you receive information. If you want to quiten the mental chatter , you have to practise formal meditation daily, because if you are developed in this you can, with few attempts, shut off a lot of thinking by an act of will. As a beginner it is better to start a small meditation session, seeing and remembering the various benefits that mindfulness entails and making it a habit. Slowing one's behaviours down (walking speed, speech, eating pace...) can all act like cues so that mindfulness re-occurs. Secular mindfulness, usually taught by Jon Kabar Zinn, is kind of just experiencing and savoring the moment, one's pains and emotions and for stress reduction (MBSR - Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction). In cognitive behaviour therapies it is employed to become more aware of thoughts and emotions and then to either challenge these thoughts or with a curious attitude let them drift away (Zinn mentions beginner's mind and acceptance for example as basic attitudes). In Buddhism, however, mindfulness (sati-sampajañña) has a variety of uses. It is used to remember (sati) certain teachings (dhammas), apply situational wisdom (sampajañña) due to the "rememberance" (sati), developing the 4 satipatthanas (4 foundations of mindfulness: Body, feelings, Thoughts and Phenomena), developing concentration to penetrate meditation subjects so that the mind sticks at the object/subject. Due to the concentration, the mind becomes calm and can do the thinking/concentration without getting carried away by other thoughts, noises et cetera unrelated to the meditation. One more thing: Since mindfulness or concentration seems to be important for you, Buddhism teaches us that morality and one's positive emotions give rise to more concentration. If one is always angry, anxious, jealous etc. your mind will be restless and sleepy quite quickly.
