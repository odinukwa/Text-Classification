I personally define Art as any attempt to be understood. This reflects essentially all writing, rhetoric, painting, and the like. Some of those things involve sentiment, and some do not. An attempt to be understood which does not involve sentiment might include a passage in a math textbook, or a scientific paper (depending on what you consider sentiment to be, and what threshold level of it is relevant). Personally, I feel that expressing a mathematical truth in such a way that it can be understood is art, whether there is sentiment in it or not. Euler's Formula is a rather beautiful piece of art, I would say, and the derivations I have seen inspire me in much the same way as other art does. Your question hinges on how you define art. If you would like a cold mathematical textbook with no sentiment in it to qualify as art, as I do, the answer to your question is "no." If you would not like to consider that art, the answer seems to be "yes," but we still need a definition to see if we can falsify the premise. Try not to use the word "sentiment" in your definition. 

You pose the following apparent contradiction and I gather that your question asks why it isn't considered to be a logical fallacy in Descartes' argument: 

I think the chink in your line of reasoning is the assumption that in the phrase "doubt everything", Descartes uses the word everything to mean literally everything, including doubts. In the context you've supplied, Descartes is using an implicitly iterative approach to discarding whatever can be discarded on the basis that they are not necessarily true (in the sense of correspondence of those things with reality). Two of the iterations are noted, which: 

War is a political concept. War is something that a country does when its constitution says "this is the set of conditions under which a war happens." There might be things that don't fit that technical definition, but are practically similar to wars. You might call those wars, or "armed conflicts," or whatever... But the basic idea of war is just that it's a construct of how countries interact with one another. You might say that, for some countries, one individual leader has the authority to declare war, but that would only be as a function of the country's processes. You can ask whether it's my brain or heart that thinks (obviously, my brain), but if you're asking whether I'm thinking, yes, I am. So if a subset of the country is given authority to declare war on the country's behalf, the country has declared war. To be clear, in the United States, no one person can ever declare war. Only congress can declare war, and that involves many people. You might also ask whether I, as an ordinary citizen and civilian, am a party to that war, or am morally responsible for the war. But the country definitely declared the war, and went to war. 

It's not always the case that the natural-language pattern B causes A translates fully to the logic statement B -> A. But if we accept the mapping for sake of discussion, then the deductive step itself is simply taking the contrapositive and therefore sound: B -> A, therefore !A -> !B. The problem with the two natural-language examples in your question is that in each case, "A occurs because B causes it" hasn't been established. It is simply assumed, and a conclusion is derived from that assumption. Let X = "B causes A" and Y = "!A -> !B". Then the argument is "X, therefore Y". But since X and Y are logically equivalent, if someone doesn't already accept Y then it makes for a weak argument to prove Y by simply assuming X. In your examples, if the statements of causation aren't already accepted as axiomatically true, then they don't help establish the respective deductions. 

It is greater than God and more evil than the devil. The poor have it, the rich need it and if you eat it youâ€™ll die. What is it? ... I hate riddles like that. Because the whole point of a riddle is "fit something into this odd set of rules," and there isn't anything that fits into this odd set of rules, and the only answer is to give up. And that's supposed to be clever. So... yes, it's easy for people to think that "nothing" is an affirmative type of thing... But if you're worried about that, just be conscious of what you're saying when you say it, and what others are saying when you say it. I think that actual problems with the word "nothing" will be rare, but hey, you might catch some weird issues. 

Each model necessarily has its own set of abstractions. Conclusions that are consistent with each model don't necessarily have to be consistent across models. For example, the strings model may not encode the concept of colour, and a static model may not encode the concept of growth or change. Nevertheless, since the models are non-destructive descriptions of the tree, they can co-exist. So to your question of whether the various 'beings' can simultaneously be valid, I'd answer that yes, they can be simultaneously valid, but any conclusions must reference the respective model(s) from which they were derived. For example, if one synesthesist calls the tree colour 6 and another 7, the numbers are relative to the respective synesthesists. 

I always assumed that those numbers were to be approximated as well as possible -- short of coming up with a machine for measuring Intensity of pleasure and pain, how else could we know? I think this is evidenced by the fact that the equations typically used for a hedonistic calculus are a. always symbolic and b. never quite right. For example, I tend to see that intensity should be multiplied by duration, when anybody who understands basic calculus understands that it must, rather, be integrated over time. I don't think the development of the calculus serves as anything more than a thought experiment -- "here's how you should think about ethics. Think of ethics as an equation, a mathematical function that spits out a 'do X' or a 'do not do X.'" The details of the equation are only there to show you that such an equation can take many details into account, and appear quite valid on its face -- it does not seem that it is for actual use. 

I'll take your question to be asking for the flaws in the linked argument to moderation. The 'middle ground' needs to be evaluated on its own merits. It's not a priori a good solution or a bad solution simply because it is the middle ground. More generally, if the values at the ends are comparable in the context of a partial ordering, the value of the middle could be argued to lie between them. That is, if there is a metric by which the 'worst' solution is measurably worse than the 'best' solution, a 'moderate' solution would by definition be measurably 'sandwiched' between them. If the values at the ends are not comparable (in that same sense), or if there's no agreement on the overall metric to use, then they are not truly 'ends', but simply alternatives in some solution space for which no metric has been imposed. In that case, a 'middle' or compromise might well have better utility - or worse. In the information-misinformation example you raise, one end is considered to be the only answer. There, it isn't simply that the middle is no good - it's that except for the single accepted answer, every answer is no good. 

You have to ask, given your understanding of sociology and given how well you've otherwise arranged society, what the likelihood is that the mass surveillance will be abused at the expense of those worst off. Then, you have to consider what the benefit will be to those worst off. Imagine this from such a perspective, and make the "selfish" choice. Personally, I feel that some version of effective encryption will, from this point forward, always be necessary, even in the most ideal society one can realistically imagine. Until we reach such an ideal society, I think the US Constitution provides pretty good approximations of the boundary line, and that the current extent of US surveillance is unconstitutional. I particularly feel that metadata is more sensitive than judges have yet understood. But, that's all me answering the question as a realist, and I think of Rawlsian philosophy as an idealistic one... I'm not sure how much more surveillance I would abide in a more ideal world, but I think it would be more. 

Note that Descartes distinguishes between thoughts and doubts, so the word thoughts is used in a somewhat more limited fashion than the arbitrary subject matter of thinking. That is, one can think thoughts and one can think doubts, which Descartes treats as quite separate categories. (This might be considered a fallacy in itself today.) After several iterations, Descartes is left with untrusted thoughts (or doubts as your quote has it). But even though those thoughts were untrusted, their existence could not be denied (i.e. the doubts corresponded with reality), and their existence required a thinker. Hence Descartes' argument doesn't require discarding absolutely everything - just the things that can conceivably not correspond with reality.
