I am interested in results about exact algorithms as well as about good heuristics. Pointers to articles are also welcome. 

the three possible paths through a fan in a Halin graph; the weightsum of each path is distributed to two cutedges, depicted as solid thick lines. The colored thick lines correspond to path edges, of which arrows are cycle-edges and undirected lines are tree edges. Dashed lines are the fan edges that will be contracted; the colored ones are on the optimal path which in turn depends on the pair of given cutedges. 

edit: calculating the area of each face and then taking the maximum of those values is of course a valid method, but I am hoping for something more efficient because the problems are of very high dimension. This edit is motivated by the valuable feedback of @IgorRivin. 

I know, that an answer will depend on the specific circumstances; therefore I am not looking for a yes/no decision, but rather a list of answers that address the specifics of different situations, e.g. datatypes or coding schemes like IEEE 754 or BCD for real implementations or, for different theoretical models of computation. 

the complexity of the algorithm is governed by the $O(n^3)$ estimate for the all pairs shortest paths calculations, plus $O(n^3)$ for determining the number of shortest paths, on which an edge is. 

if the vertical offset is approximately the same within a vector, then it would be a simple strategy to subtract the mean value in order to 'normalize' the vectors before calculating Euclidean distances. Yet another approach could be to work with the vectors of differences of 'adjacent' coordinate values, which reduces the dimension of vectors by 1. These methods are low hanging fruits; maybe they already suffice to solve your problem. 

I am currently ruminating about ways of generalizing Minimum Spanning Trees to Minimum Spanning "Hypertrees", where the cost is associated with simplex volumes and, where certain topological constraints must be met (the "Hyper" is borrowed from the use in Hyper Graphs); I also managed to devise a Binary Programming formulation, which could also be adapted for calculating Minimal Surface Area Polyhedra spanning a set of 3D points, but I couldn't find anything new on the complexity of that task; there is a paper by Joseph O'Rourke from 1981 (Polyhedra of minimal area as 3D object models), where it is stated, that it is not known whether it is an NP problem. 

Since your questions refers to infinite dimensional spaces and not specifically to Banach spaces, it might interest you that there are positive results for locally convex spaces. These all to a certain extent rely on the fact that in general lcs's, in contrast to Banach spaces, (for example, in Montel spaces or reflexive Banach spaces with the weak topology), one can have large compact sets. The main principle behind the results is that in the presence of compactness one can employ the finite dimensional case by reducing to projective limits of spectra of finite dimensional spaces. One possible reference is the Studia Math. paper of K. Astala "On Peano's theorem in locally convex spaces, 73 (1982), 214-223. 

Not sure if this is relevant to your question but there are two natural and well known ways to get self-dual spaces in the category of locally convex spaces, namely objects of the form $E \times E'$ (the cartesian product of a lcs with its dual---this works for reflexive spaces) and the tensor product $E \otimes E'$ (which works for nice nuclear spaces, say Frechet (can't get the accent right) or $DF$---due to the nuclearity one doesn't have to specify which tensor product is being used). The latter space can be identified with the operator space $L(E)$ with the strong topology in this situation. 

The proper framework for your question is the so-called strict topology on the space of bounded continuous functions which was introduced for the case of a locally compact space by R.C. Buck in the 50's and extended to the case of a completely regular space by several authors around 1970. It has the property that the dual is the space of tight Radon measures. In your case (locally compact and metric, and so paracompact), there are very strong results available, particularly in the direction that you are interested in---characterisations of compactness and convergence for families of measures. A central result concerns the relationship between weak compactness and uniform tightness of such families. You might start by consulting the article "The strict topology and compactness in the space of measures" by John B. Conway which appeared in the Transactions 126 (1967) 474-486. You could also look up the topic of Prohorov's theorem which is relevant to your query. 

A candidate curve with few directions with finite number of intersections might constructed from the Blancmange curve as a fractal curve, that can serve as a building block for constructing "evil" Jordan curves with Hausdorff dimension 1 (for the properties of the more general Takagi functions refer to e.g. this article). The simplest idea would be to take the union of the curve itself and its reflection at the x-axis (refering to the images on the linked webseite). A bit more complicated is the idea of constructing an analoge of a "sine wave" by point-reflecting the curve at one of its endpoints and use a phase shifted version of the result as an analogue of a "cosine wave". A parametric function $x(t)=cosinewave(t),\ y(t)=sinewave(t)$ may be even better, but I haven't done any investigations on whether the set of inner point of the region bounded by that "Blancmonge circle" is connected. Caveat: But, despite having Hausdorff dimension 1, the resulting curves are not rectifiable and thus not an example of the sought kind of curves. 

Background of my question is Martin Gardner's "unexpected hanging" paradoxon, which has once again be the subject of an article in a popular-scientific magazin (this time because this year it has been 5 years since Martin Gardner passed away on May 22nd). The essence of the paradox is whether it is possible to predict that an event will come unexpectedly, despite an inductive proof that that isn't possible. What I would like to know is, what the mathematical interpretation of "expected/unexpected" is in the context of the paradoxon; specifically whether it is related to probability measures. 

let $x=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\delta_i2^{-i},\ \delta_i\in\{0,1\}$. Is there an algorithm that converts the sequence $(\delta_0,\ \delta_1,\ ...)$ of the binary digits of $x$ to the sequence $[a_0;a_1,\ ...]$ of its continued fraction representation? 

A more practical heuristic for generating dispersed point sets inside a compact region $\Omega$, that also generates to higher dimensions is the following, which I would like to call the stay away from the lines heuristic: Let $V$ denote the set of already determined points and, $L= \{v_i+\lambda(v_j-v_i))| v_i,v_j\in V\wedge i \lt j \}$ the set of lines through the pairs of determined points, then the next point to be included into $V$ is the element an element of $\Omega$ that maximizes the minimal distance to the lines in $L$. After the new point has been determined, $L$ has to be updated accordingly. In case of a disk, one could either start with two antipodal points on the boundary or, with the three equidistant points on the boundary; I am not sure, which of the options will yield the better point set. 

Let $p$ be a prime, and $\alpha$ a positive integer. How do you compute the space of $p$-ordinary $p$-adic modular forms (in the sense of Serre) of weight 2 on $\Gamma_0(p^\alpha)$? I'm really only concerned with the cases where $\Gamma_0(p^\alpha)$ is genus zero and $\alpha = 1, 2$. [Edit: Changed from space of $p$-adic modular forms (which is really big) to the subspace of $p$-ordinary forms (which I think should be finite dimensional)] 

I'm reading "On Ranks of Twists of Elliptic Curves and Power-Free Values of Binary Forms" by Stewart and Top, and struggling to understand the argument on pg 962 which shows that the rank of a particular elliptic curve $E_{D(t)}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is exactly 2. Here are the relevant details: Start with the elliptic curve $$E/\mathbb{Q}: y^2 = x^3 + 1$$ and the polynomial $$D(t) = 2t(t - 1)(t + 1)(2t + 1)(t + 2) \in \mathbb{Z}[t].$$ Let $C/\mathbb{Q}$ be the curve given by $s^3 = D(t)$ and let $$E_D/\mathbb{Q}(t): y^2 = x^3 + D(t)^2.$$ For each point $P = (x(t), y(t))$ in $E_D(\mathbb{Q}(t))$, we define an element $\phi_P$ of $\text{Mor}_\mathbb{Q}(C, E)$ by $$\phi_P(t, s) = (x(t)/s^2, y(t)/s^3).$$ Then we have a map $$\lambda: E_D(\mathbb{Q}(t)) \to H^0(C, \Omega^1_{C/\mathbb{Q}})$$ given by $$\lambda(P) = \phi_P^\ast \omega_E$$ which is shown to be a homomorphism with finite kernel. We want to use this homomorphism to show that the rank of $E_D/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ is exactly two. First, we can find two points, and show they are independent by looking at their images under $\lambda$. This is fine, and shows that the rank is at least 2. Next, we want to show that the rank is at most 2. We know that the image lands in $H^0(C, \Omega^1_{C/\mathbb{Q}}(\zeta_3))$, the eigenspace on which the automorphism of $C$ given by $\zeta(t, s) = (t, \zeta_3 s)$ acts on differentials as multiplication by $\zeta_3$. This constrains the image to the 3-dimensional space, say spanned by $\omega_1, \omega_2, \omega_3$ (this numbering is different from the paper). All of this makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is how the authors constrain the image to a 2-dimensional subspace. They define three involutions on $C$, called $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \sigma_3$, and show that the space of $\sigma_i^\ast$-invariant holomorphic differentials is generated by $\omega_i$. Hence the quotient of $C$ by $\sigma_i$ is an elliptic curve. In two cases, the curve is isogenous to $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, and in the third case it is not. From this, they somehow infer that the rank is 2. I'm very confused about this, and would appreciate some more details or a reference. Thanks! 

Surprisingly it is possible to determine the largest face of a $d$-simplex in $O((d+2)^3)$ (or more precise: the problem isn't harder than in inverting a $(d+2)\times (d+2)$-matrix, namely the associated Cayley-Menger matrix $\hat{B}$. I was able to find an efficient solution of the stated problem, when I discovered an online article by G. Westendorp, dated April 2013 A formula for the N-circumsphere of an N-simplex. In that article one finds an interpretation of the inverse of a Cayley-Menger matrices, $\hat{B}$$^{-1}$, that makes them (at least to me) by orders of magnitudes more interesting, than $\hat{B}$ itself. 

maybe this paper, in which the calculation of the all pairs shortest paths in $O(n^2)$ with high probability is solved, meets your requirements. Some preconditions about the distribution of edge lengths are made, which you could check against the properties of your problem instances. 

(This should be considered rather a comment on Emil's answer than an own answer; please feel free to downvote). after some thinking about Emil's negative result, I found a way to possibly "resurrect" the existence of an algorithm by introducing the means of prediction and correction. Emil's counterexample, in which $\delta_i=1$ for $i\ge i_0$, can be fixed by 

The essential problem is how to express the $\beta_i x_i y$ via linear constraints; as $\beta_i$ and $y \in {0,1}$ that is equivalent to expressing $\eta_i := \beta_i \wedge y$ via linear constraints, which is possible in the following way: $\eta_i \le \beta_i$ $\eta_i \le y$ $0 \le \eta_i$ $\beta_i+y-1 \le \eta_i$ now replace all occurences of $\beta_i x_i y$ with $\eta_i x_i$ and add the above constraints; The rest should pose no further difficulties. The general way of modeling Boolean operations via linear constraints is to take the faces of the simplex that is the convex hull of the 3D vectors, whose $x$ and $y$ coordinates correspond to the values of the variables and whose $z$ coordinate coresponds to the result of the operation. The upper faces are upper bounds and the lower faces are the lower bounds. 

There are certainly many other solutions. Here is a recipe for constructing them. If $S$ is a set (say infinite to simplify the presentation). We split $S$ into a disjoint union of $k$-element subsets $S_\alpha$. On each such subset we consider a cyclic permutation. We then fit them together to a mapping on the whole space. This clearly satisfies your condition. 

The answer in the second case is even easier. In order to avoid circularity, define the Stieltjes transform of a measure only on the complex plane minus the real axis . Then the measure has support in a compact interval if and only if this transform has an analytic continuous over the real axis outside of this interval. This has suitable generalisations to bounded measures (i.e., with not necessarily compact support) and even to distributions where it is a kingpin of the theory of distributions as boundary values of analytic functions (Köthe, Tillmann et. al). 

The result you mention uses the algebraic structure of euclidean space since it involves a form of uniform approxability of the set and its translates. However, there are many criteria for compactness which dispense with this, e.g., one which involves approximability by conditional expectations rather than translates (see, e.g., p. 295 in Bogachev, Measure Theory, vol. I) and so do not require an algebraic structure on the underlying measure space. There is, in fact, a considerable literature on compactness in $L^p$-spaces which goes back to the 30's. You might want to have a look at a recent article by Krotov in Sb. Math. 203:7 (2010) 129-148 which gives a brief historical summary in the introduction. 

This is really a comment, not an answer but I am not empowered. I am taking the liberty of reinterpreting your question (always a dangerous course) since it has already been pointed out that your operator is not compact. I think that the proper framework for your question is that of $L^2$ on a space which has symmetries induced by a group action, say transation on the real line and the rotations of the sphere, both of which are hinted at in your query. Here, although the operators you allude to are not compact, one does get an orthonormal system of eigenvectors, provided that the group is compact, as is the case of the rotation group, but not the translation one. The corresponding eigenvectors for the sphere are the spherical functions which have played a central role in mathematical physics since their introduction by Thomson (aka Lord Kelvin) and Tait. The non-compactness in the second case leads to the fact that the "eigenvectors" do not lie in the Hilbert space (but in that of the tempered distributions). There is a considerable literature on this subject at various levels of sophistication (mathematical or physical).
