The keyword here is may. You feel that this conflict between the two teams might cause damage to your team, so my question to you is Why not sit down with both the business and requirements team leads and discuss? Try to find out more about the nature of the conflict, especially given the case there are rumors, as you have stated. Rational business decisions require good information, and the information you have currently is flimsy at best (heated arguments, rumors etc). To summarize, I recommend you take the reins and be proactive by first gathering more information about the nature of the conflict, and then deciding based on facts stated, rather than rumors / hearsay what to do next. 

The Admin decides to erase some data used in the database or otherwise tamper with stored data. Now data integrity has been compromised and the resulting potentially false financial reporting can lead to huge regulatory fines. 

To me, this suggests that information silos and excessive task compartmentalization are impeding team productivity. Work dependencies are fairly common in my team / work unit due to its small size. The output of one member is often an input to the work of another team member. When communication or information does not easily flow but is divided into discrete units, frustration can occur, instances of which I have faced when working. Everyone on my team is under the same management and more or less focuses on the same area / type of projects. Our team is mainly internally facing and our projects are not exposed to customers for the most part. I am the most junior member of the team and I have a solid relationship with my manager. Would it be advisable for me to discuss this with my supervisor next time in a 1 vs 1 and if so, how can bring up improving communication without appearing presumptuous, given my rank in hierarchy? 

In this instance, I would still them thank them for their feedback. However, I would point out why their suggestion is not applicable, such as 

First, at the company level, your firm is failing at the basics of computer security and operating using practices that will not fly in a regulated environment (such as the government) with a glaring example being the below statement: 

This sounds like a miscommunication between you and your colleague. I suggest that at the end of the meeting or very soon after, compare the notes that you took and what he wrote, paying particular attention to any duplications or omissions as you wrote in your question. Try to come to a agreement on the format the notes should be in prior to having the notes being merged. It would be in your interest to have the the agreement in written form such as email. This is to protect yourself as well as ensure common understanding of expectations. 

She is taking advantage of her "special" status as the daughter of the CEO. What she did was unprofessional / rude if taking calls was part of her job duties. As to how you should handle this situation, you should first ignore of her "special" status, and treat the incident how you normally would if she were another regular employee, which she is. Bringing spoiled and childish behavior into the workplace does her no good in her future professional life, and if you were to handle this incident any differently than if the incident concerned a another employee, it can also negatively affect other's employees perception of you. 

Applications used by financial companies are often time sensitive, fr example to capture accounting transactions, or to process extremely time sensitive asset trades on the market. A attack that result in loss of ability of legitimate users and / customers to access the application is a loss because of opportunity cost of the extra time required to process the original work. 

A previous coworker who was with the company I work at left before I joined. No contact information was left. The work papers retained are inadequate in guiding me in the work I am doing. Obtaining this documentation will influence the degree of testing and the procedures I use going forward. My intent is obtaining an understanding of their judgement in executing the work that was done and the conclusion reached. I have discussed with my manager but he is unable to help me as this employee left about 6 months ago, and details are vague. How can I contact a previous employee of the company in such a circumstance? 

While the above might be a deviation to company IT security policy, its your job to evaluate what the the impact of such a deviation is on the company and adjust your reporting accordingly. I don't know the nature of the audit you have done, but if it IT focused, please see this link for consideration of materiality in reporting. In this case, true the underlying application access should be removed, but a compensating control effectively mitigated the risk - unauthorized access to / theft / tampering of data. Hence rather than reporting the deviation as a finding, consider reporting the deviation as an observation instead. 

I currently work in IT Compliance / Audit department at my company that operates in the software engineering industry. The company is large and multi - national, with many thousands of employees. My duties and departmental duties include the enforcement of internal control over IT, internal audits of IT processes, and minor security functions. I am a junior member of the team. Given the nature of the work, our department is not always welcome/ politically palatable. During my short time here, I have already experience political push - back for a recently completed internal review with findings - inadequate documentation, deviations from change policy...etc). I am sensing tension / un willingness from management in remediating the deficiencies noted. I would like to maintain a good relationship with peers and management alike without compromising our department's function, acting as an overseer that policies are followed / enforced. I try to be reasonable and rely on evidence when presenting findings, and avoid conflict. A set of norms seem to govern the culture rather than rigid policies. How can I maintain a good working relationship when the work may be politically unpalatable? 

This is problematic. As an example to illustrate what can go wrong and how it unnecessarily increases the risk to your company, consider the following hypothetical scenario 

You are the manager and him listening to you (assuming your guidance is reasonable) is in his best interests if he is interested in developing at his current job. It is fine if he disagrees with your opinion and open discussion is welcome. However, overt insubordination is not acceptable. 

As a former IT auditor, I would expect you to have a well - developed sense of intuition. Intuition is helpful when debugging code and conducting unit tests. You should be better able to anticipate what the source of a bug is and how the current code module may interact with future work. As an IT auditor, one's professional judgement is often one's strongest asset, and your past experience should help in deciding questions such as whether testing coverage is adequate, best practices are being followed, code structure is robust etc. 

Today at work my manager sent me an email requesting me to do an review on the adequacy of the internal controls surrounding a newly implemented application used by other business units within the company. I am unfamiliar with the technology used by this application, having been my first time exposed to it. I do not believe understand a full understanding is practical with the time constraints I was given. I work in IT Audit and industry / professional guidelines - proficiency - 1006.2 and Due care - 1005.1- states that only with adequate knowledge can I accept an assignment. I have always been know to be a dependable member of the team willing to go beyond expectations. I have been commended for my initiative on several occasions in the short time I have been with my current employer. How can I decline this assignment without been seen negatively / seeming apathetic to growth? 

By objectively assessing candidate on the merit his background, skills / knowledge, and professionalism. Focus on questions at the interview that are strictly related to the job such as ones quantifying the amount of prior experience he had. The statement from the sister stating that her brother is highly talented and worth considering should not be given much weight, as you do not know well this person, and that such praise should be expected, given the family relationship. Consideration of personal factors such as hardship should be minimized to help ensure all candidate are assessed with the same criteria. 

As a professional working in the InfoSec profession, I agree fully the spirit of your boss's request, but not necessarily with the recommended approach. Your boss is trying to limit the amount of people who can access the product data of your company, by restricting access to only the company premises. This is a good security practice, in line with Principle of Least Privilege. Allowing public access over the Internet unnecessarily increases the company's exposure to the risk of unauthorized data disclosure. In addition to potentially unauthorized disclosure of data, there are other risks that are increased by allowing public Internet access such as risk of internal network compromise from threats such as malware on the end user's computing device. You did not explicitly state the security classification of the data, but if the data is sensitive, then the boss has a very valid point in wanting to protect the data to the greatest extent feasible. However, you questioning whether the proposed method is the most effective is entirely appropriate and **something you should be doing. A client connection over the public Internet is by default untrusted and could contains all sorts of nasties that the company may not be able to afford to be attacked by. Unless the connection that you use is properly encrypted, such as through a properly configured VPN tunnel using an industry accepted encryption protocol (ex: SSH, IpSec etc.), then any traffic flowing over the link can be easily sniffed on the wire through man in the middle attack. Also, unless you have a client certificate , the company cannot be certain that your machine is what it claims to be. To summarize, you should absolutely follow the spirit of what your manager wants, but not necessarily the way he is proposing on doing it.
