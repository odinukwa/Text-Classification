The French campaign in Egypt and Syria had ended by August of 1801, with their defeat and surrender at Alexandria. Napoleon had abandoned them two years previous, when he returned to France, and reorganized the government in a coup against the Directorate. Where did the British troops used against the French in Egypt and Syria come from? In the earlier events they were marines and crew of the British fleet, which had total control of the Mediterranean following their destruction of Napoleon's fleet at Aboukir bay, the Battle of the Nile.

See Infection, Contagion, and Public Health in Late Medieval and Early Modern German Imperial Towns, by Annemarie Kinzelbach, published in Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences 61.3 (2006) 369-389 Abstract: From today's point of view, the concepts of "miasma" and "contagion" appear to be two mutually exclusive perceptions of the spread of epidemic diseases, and quite a number of historians have tried to discuss the history of public health and epidemic diseases in terms of a progression from the miasmic to the contagionist concept. More detailed local studies, however, indicate how extremely misleading it may be to separate such medical concepts and ideas from their actual historical context. The article presented here, based on local studies in late medieval and early modern imperial towns in southern Germany, demonstrates to what extent the inhabitants of these towns had notions of both "miasma" and "contagion." Furthermore, a contextual analysis of language shows that they did not see a necessity to strictly distinguish between these different concepts relating to the spread of diseases. Tracing the meaning of "infection" and "contagion," we find that these terms were used in connection with various diseases, and that a change in the use of the expressions does not necessarily imply a change of the corresponding notion. Moreover, a coexistence of differing perceptions cannot—as some historians have suggested—be attributed to a divergence between the academic medicine and the popular ideas of that period. A survey of measures and actions in the public health sector indicates that a coexistence of—from our point of view—inconsistent concepts helped the authorities as well as the individuals to find means of defense and consolation during all those crises caused by epidemic diseases—crises that occurred very frequently in these towns during the late medieval and early modern periods. As the article demonstrates, the interaction during such crises reveals the continuity of [End Page 369] ancient rituals and concepts as well as the adoption of new insights resulting from changes in the economical, political, scientific, religious, and social structures. No brief summary can do this topic justice; you will find examples of isolation and techniques to avoid contagious diseases all through the late medieval and early modern period, long before the development of the germ theory of disease. The techniques used were not scientific, and often failed. Plagues and Peoples covers some of this material in detail; a good read for those interested in this topic, and the historical effects of disease on civil society.

‘Twenty-five lines an hour’ says a modern calligrapher who "worked with a quill to try to estimate the speed of a twelfth-century scribe." 

Tribute from the subjugated peoples, besides food stuffs and other material needs of the people, included various items required as status symbols by the elite. Sacrificial victims were also provided in great numbers. 

Reconstructing Italy: The Ina-Casa Neighborhoods of the Postwar Era, p. 133 states that the population of Rome in 1870 was 230,000. This book also makes the (unsubstantiated) claim that the population under Augustus Caesar was 1,000,000. This was the population inside of Aurelian's Wall, which had delimited the City of Rome from Aurelian's reign, begun in 270 AD up until 1871. Discarding the Augustan guess-timate, often repeated, of 1,000,000, the population was certainly less in 270 AD than it had been in the early days of the Principate: we are in the latter days of the era of "Military Anarchy", 235-284 AD. During this period the Empire suffered "invasion, civil war, plague, and economic depression." Populations declined across the empire, including at Rome. Aurelian responded by increasing the dole of free food at Rome, which may have increased or at least supported the population of the city. In 286 AD the Emporor Diocletian moved the western capital from Rome to Mediolanum (Milano), which reduced the importance of Rome, and removed most of the military, and many of the civil bureaucrats from Rome. As a result, the population of Rome began to shrink. It is often estimated at 50,000 in the late middle ages. Thus starting with a possible maximum population of Rome and immediate surroundings of 450,000 during the early Principate, a minimum of 50,000 during the late middle ages, and increasing to 230,000 by 1871, we have not yet found an academic estimate for the population of the city during the period 270 AD and following. My guess is that Rome had already declined to a population of under 200,000 by the time of Aurelian, and thereafter declining until growth resumes in the late middle ages, and increasing steadily until it reaches 230,000 in 1871. The "Atlas of World Population History", by Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones, 1978, Penguin Books, gives the maximum population of Italy as 7 million, peaking during the first two centuries AD, during the Pax Romana. It declines to 5 million by 400 AD, and sinks to 3.5 million by 600 AD, it's lowest value. The decline during the 3rd century AD is due to the reverses of the Roman Empire, and the City of Rome will be taking many of those losses, as it is an "Imperial Parasite", feeding off of the entire empire. Thus the answer to your question is: it was at it's largest under Aurelian and his immediate successors, but thereafter in decline; the largest population ever recorded while Rome was delimited by Aurelian's Wall was the 230,000 enumerated in 1871. 

All of the Axis leaders of World War II are gathered together in a single Wikipedia article, organized by country. Selecting the leaders of interest, links are provided to their individual biographies. For example, Karl Dönitz became President of Germany on 30 April 1945. His education is not given, but as an officer he would have been a member of the educated class. 

Very unlikely, as it did not take place at Rome. The Acta Diurna was a daily record of court proceedings at Rome, for the information of the resident citizens of Rome. Think of it as the record of the local court. Provincial court proceedings would have been local affairs; if they had greater scope, the trial would have been referred to Rome, as happened with Paul of Tarsus. Some historical analysis of the various Acta is available here. It includes citations to the ancient sources. None of the actual Acta survive.

Presumably the ships of Axum were similar to the earlier ships of Egypt on the Red Sea. The ships were made of wood, and the ropes woven of papyrus. You can find more here; the ships were dismantled and stored in the caves. These ships were constructed of red cedar which had been imported from Lebanon. It is possible to use papyrus boats at sea: Thor Heyerdal managed to do this on his second try, keeping a papyrus raft at sea for two months. The Afropedia site on Axum ends with some comments on their shipping: 

The Wikipedia article on Hellenistic Judaism includes references to Greek speaking, Hellenistic Jews: It is therefore no wonder that there were synagogues of the Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians, Cilicians, and Asiatics in the Holy City itself (Acts vi. 9) The reference is to "Hellenism", Jewish Encyclopedia, Quote: from 'Range of Hellenic Influence' and 'Reaction Against Hellenic Influence' sections. So it appears that the Septuagint had a place in Jerusalem, due to the Hellenization of the Diaspora. 

Ottoman Arabia ~1914. If you carefully restrict the definition of "Arabia", one can find regions which were very loosely ruled from outside, and which were, perhaps, never invaded. Any location in the deep desert would probably qualify under this methodology. 

The work of a historian is not limited to finding information, but should include organization and analysis. Herodotus may be the Father of History, and his great work has much valuable information, but Thucydides is the first historian. On your subsidiary question, about the influence of political considerations in the works of historians - a photographical study of the works of historians will always find some form of bias. It is part of the human condition. For a more recent example, consider History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, by the Nobel Prize winning historian, Samuel Eliot Morrison, who began work in May of 1942, shortly after the start of the war! Following in the footsteps of Thucydides. 

Annette Glover & Jesse Youngs, 50nd wedding anniversary. Image from our family archive. Ella (Youngs) Kelly and her husband, C.J. Kelly, are on the left. 1879: Ella Youngs, age 16, married Christian James Kelly in Michigan. They were married for 38 years, and had 11 children between 1880 and 1896. Eight of the children lived to adulthood, with three dying as young children. 1913: Eloise Kelly, age 17, married Harlan Foster in Michigan. They were married for seven years and had three children, all living to adulthood. Her husband was absent for two years while a member of the AEF serving in Europe, and they divorced shortly after his return. These are five generations of the same family. The large families all lived on farms, under stable circumstances. The husbands were often much older than the wives. By 1900 the economic situation was changing, and only two of the children of this final generation had large families. From general research on these and other families the typical spacing of children is every two years, with the first child born within a year of the marriage. Note that a nursing mother will ordinarily not conceive, so unless a wet nurse is being used, spacing of less than two years is uncommon in older times, though goats milk is a workable replacement.
