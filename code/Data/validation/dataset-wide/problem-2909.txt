There is only one empty set. Two sets are different if one contains an element not within the other. This comes from the extensionality axiom of ZF. 

Too long for a comment: I think at the heart of this question is the common belief that religion and science are diametrically opposed. But I would also say this is a misnomer - the real key is that they do not cover the same material. It is possible for the concept usually described by the vastly unspecific and overgeneralized word "science" to address religious issues - though it's unlikely. In particular, if a god or gods were to appear, demonstrate their powers, and the like, then it is not the case that the scientific community would still refute this. In some freshman physics class I took in college, I remember there being a student who had a really hard time separating the concept of theory and fact. Really, he had a hard time acknowledging that 'science' was not based on facts, but on approximated theories founded upon approximate observations - they can compete, multiple theories can both be brought forward, etc. What I'm getting at is that the idea of a 'scientific perspective' seems poorly defined. If you mean from the perspective of coming up with ideas and subjecting them to the test of being compared with observation and logic, then that's one thing. If you mean describe the sort of deity-like perhaps-sentient Designer(s) with a set of rules governing behavior, or to mathematically demonstrate sort of property, or to see what would happen if we shot two of such creators at each other (as I continue to poke at my physics buddies) - that's another thing. Further, it's not so clear what you mean by intelligent design, or even intelligence? Could you clarify, especially on what sort of characterization of this 'intelligence' that you mean? 

There is a mathematical idea of handedness. Phenomena that are not identical to their mirror images are called chiral, and chirality has interesting roles in physics, chemistry, and biology. It's not quite what you were looking for, but it's still pretty interesting. 

There are many things that are unclear or uncertain in this question. What does it mean to be "scientific?" Since you use the phrase falsifiable, I will assume you refer to the idea of science as put forward by Karl Popper. In particular, the scientific method is about testing ideas through empirical falsifiability. A theory cannot be proven right, but it can be falsified. In this context, the act of declaring any one thing or another is not the pertinent question. You ask if "saying something has existed" is falsifiable. This is broad and depends on many things. Let's say I claim that I have existed for 200 years. To better ignore metaphysical questions about what it means to exist, let's rephrase this as I have been alive for 200 years. Sure, this is a lousy theory. My parents and governmental records could easily say that I wasn't. In that sense, it is falsifiable - but it's mostly an uninteresting theory. Whether or not one calls it scientific, it is utterly irrelevant. But it may be that you are asking about whether the actual techniques that scientists use to date events in the past are scientific. And here, the answer is yes. There are very many interrelated theories about dating. Some can be found on the Wikipedia page Absolute Dating. The important aspect is that we have theories involving dating from carbon-14, or potassium-argon, or argon-argon, or thermoluminescence, or relatively simpler tasks like counting tree rings or cross-examining found fossils or the like. The Earth's magnetic field changes from time to time, and we believe we understand how this affects rocks. So some rocks can be roughly dated through paleomagnetism. Or we can use volcanic ash. We build up larger cohesive theories about dating from these smaller, individual theories. Counting tree rings is a particularly easy to imagine theory with clear testing mechanisms. Grow some trees, take core samples, and count the rings. We can get a little more involved by noting that particularly large rings occur during seasons of particularly favorable weather. Matching these up across many trees (and fossilized or otherwise preserved trees from the past) might allow one to get even deeper. Now someone might come along and start to compare carbon-14 dating to tree ring dating. If there was disagreement, then something is wrong. Ideas must be adjusted or thrown away. And so it goes, each part tested and honed against each other. I haven't even mentioned that each technique is interrelated with areas of science. Nuclear physicists and geologists have a lot to say about the science going into their respective techniques. The fact that we now have a rather large and interconnected set of resources for dating suggests that dating is highly scientific. As a final reference, you might consider reading about the Problem of induction, which is a related concern. 

3. The Distinction Between Truth and Existence: The fallacy that leads to equating "Existence" and "Truth" is that only the "Truth Value" of "Existence" is compared to "Truth", not the "holistic" value of the qualities that make up existence, (time, location, form, nature, etc.). 

Note 1: In Deductive, Inductive, and Abductive Logic, the term "Necessarily" changes to "Probably" and then "Plausibly". Note 2: This "definition" applies within the contexts of logic and even causality, (it breaks down in metaphysics, etc.; In metaphysics it is not necessary that "a square must have 4 equal sides"). In the context of logic, this definition could be falsified if these definitions somehow do not apply to a valid conclusion following a valid syllogism. Disproving a "Truth": 

2. Answer - the Simplest, Consistent and Valid Definitions of "Truth" and "Falsity": Logic is a computational process, examining the validity of a context of reasoning to infer a conclusion that has a "Truth Value". So, "Truth" is to "Reasoning", as "PI" is to "Circles" - an inviolable constraint. "Truth" defined in Terms of Logic, (premises, conclusions and implications): 

Because of this "injection", there is a lot of equivocation between the terms. But, abstractly: even if "2 + 2 = 4" is true AND ALSO exists. ... It would appear that "2 + 2 = 4" would exist in a different "domain of reality" than where "my tomato" exists in my own "causal domain". Causality does not necessarily apply to logic, but can certainly be a factor. And, when one domain of reality is plausibly affected by other domains, it is plausible that certain domains might "override" each other. 

2. Addressing Confirmation Biases: 2.1. A Source for Creativity, Inspiration, Abductive Reasoning: Theism and Mysticism have incredibly expanded what we have thought possible / plausible, (this is abductive logic, not inductive nor deductive). For example: We aren't living in the Dark Ages any more, and we know the plausibility of gods is certain - especially given: we are already creating artificial worlds, intelligences, toying with nano-technology, quantum mechanics, biological engineering, terra-forming, etc. 

3. Why we find pleasure in creat/ing/ed beings: We are in fact creating "beings" - of some sort, certainly not as complex as ourselves - yet. If we are examining "God", transcendent of this causal domain, of physicality, and time - then any "physical pleasure" we find could not be validly attributed to God too. So, necessarily - the list would have to be limited - somewhat - to apply between a "Life Giving Spirit" towards "Mankind" - in the same ways we might find pleasure in the beings we are creating, (to establish plausibility). Our greatest pleasures creating beings, are in those that are "like us" - at least seeming to take pleasure in the same experiences that we do, (literature, comics, movies, virtual reality, etc.). 

2.2. Evolving Definitions and Perceptions: Deism, Atheism, and Mysticism, in their various forms, throughout history, are relative constructs, and have changed over time. It is absolutely certain that our concepts of theism/mysticism will mature further. Consider: Justin Martyr defended Christianity against accusations of atheism. 

I think that one of the biggest changes in war came with the apparent end of conventional warfare after the Gulf War. It is simply unreasonable for almost any state (a few exceptions, perhaps, but not so many) to expect to confront NATO in so-called 'conventional' ways and be successful. The Art of War speaks at great length of how generals should command, Sun Tzu even mentions that "All war is based on deception." But he took this only insofar as to attack when your enemy thinks you are weak, and to appear strong even when you are weak so as to discourage attack (Baden Powell truly embodied this in the Battle of Mafeking, which also led to the development of the Boy Scout Movement). Yet modern forms of deception are far more complicated, and warfare conducted in ways that appear far less ordered, than ever before. I think that some of the seminal works now would include On Guerilla Warfare, by Mao Tse-Tung, and Urban Warfare. These include some philosophy, some straight-up strategy and tactics, and some ideology. With the current trends in combat ranging from conventional to highly asymmetric, I think that these texts should also be included. 

I'll answer from the completely math-style logic POV. We know this person has a brother. What is the probability that s/he's male? Let us assume that half of the population is male and the other half female, that this is very uniformly distributed, that the gender of previous children doesn't affect gender of any future child of a couple, etc. Let us also assume for a moment that the figure has exactly 1 sibling. Then a priori, there were four equally likely possibilities in his family were BB, BG, GB, and GG. Now we know one is a boy. So we are left with 3 equally likely possibilities: BB, BG, and GB. In two of the three, the shrouded figure is a female. Correspondingly, 1/3 that he's a guy. Now suppose the shrouded figure has 2 siblings. Each of the previous possibilities can be modified 'in pairs,' so that we get BBB/BBG, BGB/BGG, GBB/GBG, GGG/GGB. Knowing one is a boy leaves BBB/BBG, BGB/BGG, GBB/GBG, GGB. Thus we have 1 situation in which he's a guy, 3 in which s/he's 50/50, and 3 in which she's a girl. So now the chances are smaller - 5/14 that he's a guy (approximately 1/3). And so on. In general, it's more likely given these assumptions and that we don't know the relative ages that the figure is a girl. It is Monty Hall style. 

Too long to be a comment - this is really just a set of references. In Aristotle considers happiness in book X of Nichomachean Ethics. I recommend it because it would provide you with a good background in which to phrase your questions. But it certainly has its critics. A more 'modern' viewpoint comes from John Stuart Mill, and in his work Utilitarianism in particular. Although Mill is a utilitarian (not a surprise, given his book title), many consider him to be a certain type of hedonist. A running theme in his writing is that the general actions of people should best increase general happiness. 

A [Exists] A > B [is True] A [Exists] Therefore "B [is True]" "B [is True]" does not necessarily mean "B [Exists]". 

Logic: That which is true, because it must be. (Vulnerable to Creative, Cleverer, Thinking.) Empirical Evidence: What is physically observable. (Vulnerable to full awareness of a Causal Domain.) Moral Veracity: What is equanimitable, (Limited by Entropy). Wisdom: What brings fulness of life - in the context of eternity, (Limited by lack of transcendent awareness.) etc., etc. - Tradition, et al. 

Is Epictetus implying there is only ever just one cause for our actions? Or, is Epictetus arguing there is one cause which outweighs all others? What is Epictetus saying this cause actually is? 

2. The Text, Epictetus Discourses 1.11: Because ἓν / one is given emphatic placement, and because I understand ἐπὶ πάντων to indicate "Primacy / Importance", I read it as: 

Obviously, I am speaking to some common Scriptural passages - to avoid the meritless claims of a mis-deific characterization, (like "God" as a "celestial-dictator", solipsistic, and self-fulfilling, etc.); Obviously this argument only aspires to an abductive or inductive conclusion - through analogy, as it probably isn't valid to actually dogmatically represent a non-corporeal "God" dwelling in a transcendent domain of reality - which would be hard to relate to. 

A False Presupposition: " So, theists don't??? I am supposing that the original question is actually addressing . 

2.5. A Good Faith Effort to Address Confirmation Biases: Yes, there are "Logic" and "Science" biases too. (The historical debate over the exact nature of mankind's evolution is a great example, the Scriptural account being one of the first examples of genetic engineering.) Mankind, still in its infancy, cannot rationally assert which bias is more valid than others, let alone argue that each bias doesn't have some validity in their own right. The Scientific method, at the very least, requires an assessment of rival hypotheses. Accordingly, it is often observed that when rival hypotheses are rejected - those hypotheses often evolve, and even the de-facto hypotheses mature too. It is prima-facie apparent that each different confirmation bias has led to hypotheses that have challenged and refined other hypotheses under different biases. This mechanic of intra-accountability between standards of truth has added, and still adds value, to the scientific method - is not too burdensome, and risks can be reasonably mitigated. Regardless, this mechanic of intra-accountability can only be dismissed according to the same exact principles that other mechanics in scientific development could be dismissed. Until that burden of proof is met - then it is not reasonable to dismiss the "dialectic" between "Theism" and "Science". (Whether that burden of proof has already been met, or how it could be met, is a great question, tbh.) 

2. The Plausibility of Pleasure: Suppose that "God" is defined, (at least in part), as the creator of beings. Then analogously, if we created beings - we could be considered "gods". And, if we find pleasure in our creation - then it stands to reason that our own creator would plausibly find pleasure too. The question then becomes - why are we finding pleasure in creating beings?
