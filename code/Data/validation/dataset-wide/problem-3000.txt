I wanted to understand the concept of non-truth function (which I found when reading about conditionals in logic). The definition of non-truth function that I have is (from reddit): 

I was trying to understand the truth functional definition of an implication "if A then B"/"if A, B". I was reading Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy article on indicative conditional and in the 3rd paragraph it seems they try to definition what an implication is. They discuss it in that paragraph but then they have the following statement (which I don't understand): 

So it would make sense to bring up examples that are relevant to that definition (otherwise why use "if A, B" to define something if its not going to mean sort of what it usually means). So it seems to me that its suppose to bring an uncontroversial example of why implications can be True when (true,true), or (false,True), or (false,false). If that is the case, can someone explain me how this example exemplifies this? At this point of the text we have not defined what an implication means and the example should be self evident, so I'd love to know why its self evident. 

Free will is already misattributed to Self. Thus, destruction of wrong concept of Self does not affect free-will at all. 

Good effects such as good popularity, high social status, good regard, intelligence, from buddhist point of view, is result of previous good (in buddhist sense) conduct. So if you want to achieve such qualities in future or also have them in next births you should live and act propely (in buddhist sense again), be generous, don't harm other beings, study dharma (meditate, develop wisdom and other required mind qualities). Of course to have such goal is samsaric type of wholesomeness, which is normal in buddhism. But buddhism also provide higher type of goal - enlightenment. Buddhism have some straightforwardiness in it. Like if you want to be regarded as honest person - be honest person. But priority of being honest is (much) higher than being regarded as honest. Being honest also conductive to other good effects and development of mind. Even if buddhist, for example, is slandered without apparent reason, he/she should regard is as result of wrong conduct in previous lifes. 

After reading a response I got on reddit to this it made me consider a part of a sentence in that paragraph that might be relevant to understand the whole better: 

It seems to me that that it is very controversial depending on what you want "if A then B" to mean (i.e. we are coming up with its truth funtional definition). In the section of the article we are deciding what an implication should mean. A quick view in the dictionary says: 

in other words, if we have a functional that receives boolean values (caused by some propositions I assume) then we cannot unambiguously assign it a truth (boolean) value. The abstract definitions sort of make sense to me but when I move to try to come up with a concrete single example that elucidates the concept transparently I can't find one with an explanation that makes sense to me. For example one that looks promising is an example provided in the reddit thread: 

if that is the case then the "because" can be used the same as a conditional of propositional logic. If that were not the case how is it that we need extra information to discover if that functional is true or not? It seems to unambiguously assign truth values. What "extra" info do we need? Can someone show me a clear example of a function that could be assigned the value true and false or unknown even for example F(A,B) = F(True,True) where A and B are propositions that might be true or false? 

So beautiful material objects (of five senses) are 'strings of sensuality' (kamaguna). While they are certainly considered dangerous they are not in itself bad. (Also, seeing them could be results of good karma.) What is bad is to have passion for them (kamaraga). 

Buddha in BrahmajƒÅla Sutta didn't say there there is four alternatives about World's finiteness, he says that some recluses and brahmins have have such and such opinions. Difference is, that Buddha describes other's opinions, and not stating his opinion. In this tetralemma position is nothing particularly Buddhist, this is just Indian logic at the time (see Catuskoti). Why it's fourfold and not twofold (as is usual in A and ~A). Because, it is logic of natural language and not formal logic. In formal logic we have rule of identity to be also represented in language, so we can state that what is written as A is always meant as A (and vice versa), so there is only ~A possible as alternative (in formal writings). In natural language, we don't have such important convention, so it is possible to write that thing is A (in some sense), and in same time not A (in other sense), where sense of such writing should be derived implicitly. Non-formal writing would look contradictory if we miss context (i.e. if we misinterpret it). As a consequence, there is four alternatives instead of two to cover all possible 'syntax'. 

what I don't understand is why the previous statement would be true (or actually take any boolean/logical value at all) if we don't actually have any figure to consider. For me it seems we are trying to define the boolean function f(A,B) = " if A, B" but in the context of the quote they give they essentially make A(x) a function of the shape and then ask me to consider what the truth value of g(x) = f(A(x),B(x)) would be. It seems really silly because we have not actually given the input x to A (or B in fact because "it" refers to the geometrical shape in question). Thus, for me regardless of what definition of implications I am trying to derive, I would leave that specific example as neither True or False, because we have not given the arguments to the function to be evaluated at all! Am I right? Or am I missing something very simple? What is the purpose of that sentence in that article. It seems to be more confusing (and distracting) than helpful in convey whatever point they are trying to convey. How does it help them justify the definition of implication? Whats the use of that example in that paragraph? 

Person. As long as person's will is not suppressed she is free willing. Action itself. Any voluntary, conscious action is free-willed. (And action could be blamed or praised.) By causality action will bring consequences as type of responsibility. And on deeper level, conscious attitude towards action. (Consciousness which is arranged in a way to be supportive of producing wrong actions, is in same time supporting arising of consequences for such actions.) 

On a conventional level, it's Person. On phenomenological level, 'who' is not a question, if there is no Self as phenomenon. There will be will, which is characterized as being free, and which is worked out by other consciousness phenomena. 

Fictional is what not correspond to reality. It could be completely fictional (Buddhist example is atman), or just mistaken thinking about reality (Buddhist example is pratityasamutpada). Latter one could also have cause and effects, for example, if we imagine in deterministic way. Deterministic imagination could be very strong and causal to us (impossible to imagine differently, in more pleasant way), even though it's still imagination. Thus, if we imagine about real entities which have capacities, we could also imagine (or even conclude that) our imaginations as having capacities. 

It really depends on what you mean by "stronger". Your question seems to be looking for a way to make two very different concepts of belief somehow comparable. There are a few ways to go about looking at that, but we first need to get clear on the two different versions of "belief" in your question. You "believe" axioms for the sake of argument. Let's call this belief(1). You generally "believe" in God in a different way - you don't just accept God's existence for the sake of argument, you accept it as an impersonal reality. We'll call this belief(2). Belief(1) is systems dependent - when you move from Euclidean to non-Euclidean geometry, the axioms change. They haven't been falsified, but largely because you also never made a truth claim about them. You simply said that these assumptions look very reasonable and we need them to do interesting things with bearing on reality, so we'll treat them as though they were true, sidestepping altogether the question of whether they really are true. Belief(2) is different. You don't just treat the claim as true for the purposes of doing something else. Belief(2) is an impersonal, systems independent truth claim. It's more impactful in that you're not just treating the belief as the foundation for an extended thought experiment. In some ways, this makes it more sturdy, in others, less. Now, as I say, there are a few different ways of comparing these two to see which is stronger, and it depends what you mean by "stronger." I'll give three, but I don't claim this as an exhaustive listing by any stretch of the imagination. First, we could consider the capacity of each for impact. In this respect, belief(2) is pretty clearly stronger than belief(1). Because belief(1) is systems dependent, it has no real facility to reach beyond the system into which it is bound. It has impact on the (intellectual) world only so long as its system is widely accepted. Belief (1) may give us new ways of looking at things, but it ultimately makes no claims about the way things really are. As such, it has relatively little power to change the world. This is not to say that its power to change is small, merely that by comparison to belief(2), belief(1) generally won't change as much as fast or for as long. Closely tied to that first method of comparison is a second, the commitment each requires from adherents. Belief(1) is easily abandoned. Once the system to which it is tied falls out of favor or ceases to be useful for a current project, belief(1) can be left behind quickly and easily. Students learn to do this as their intellectual life gains complexity and they discover that principles which once seemed sure bedrock are actually more like sand traps. Belief(2), by contrast, requires significant commitment. It requires more intellectual and moral investment, more time to create, and more time to destroy. It would be appropriately cognized, I think, under the name "worldview", in this respect, and many people have belief(2) about things like religion or politics. There's a reason civil discourse steers clear of those two items in the interests of remaining civil. The contrast here may be nicely brought out by considering what it might look like to have belief(1) concerning one's political views. Consider, for instance, the explanation of a senior civil servant to a junior civil servant concerning the nature of his beliefs: "I have served eleven governments in the past thirty years. If I had believed in all their policies, I would have been passionately committed to keeping out of the Common Market, and passionately committed to going into it. I would have been utterly convinced of the rightness of nationalising steel. And of denationalising it. And renationalising it. On capital punishment, I'd have been a fervent retentionist and an ardent abolishionist. I would've been a Keynesian and a Friedmanite, a grammar school preserver and destroyer, a nationalisation freak and a privatisation maniac; but above all, I would have been a stark, staring, raving schizophrenic." (Yes, Minister, "The Whiskey Priest"). The senior civil servant very clearly holds his political views as belief(1) in the interests of being able to do his job. Most people are not so flexible. The third way we might compare the two is in fallibility, and here, belief(1) shines. Because it's not making a truth claim at all, just presenting a hypothetical set of principles for the world to see what comes of it, belief(1) is basically unfalsifiable. Belief(2), on the other hand, is making a truth claim, and usually a very strong one. It therefore can be falsified. Belief(1) is the less prone to being wrong, but largely because it doesn't try to be right. All of which is to say, you've asked a very complicated question to which no simple answer exists.
