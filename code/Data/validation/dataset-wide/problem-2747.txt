The truth is that Stoicism was never supposed to be a purely detached way of life. Zeno introduced Stoic ethics explicitly as a middle way between the detached extreme of the Cynics (who withdrew from society) and the worldly extreme of the Cyrenaics (who sought to maximize pleasurable indulgences). Virtue Leads to Action 

The combination of these two elements are what allow modern Stoics to not just avoid being inactive and ineffective, but to really roll up their sleeves and get into the messy details of changing the world. See for example this modern Stoic blog post, with the perhaps counter-intuitive title "Why Stoicism is Great for Activism." 2. Emotional Motivation 

What spiritual philosophy does Robert LawrenceKuhn describe here? This view says that everything exists because of the value of the totality of universe. 

Evil is often explained as a result (a byproduct, in a sense) of the free will God has given to us. Doesn't this notion contradict the idea of the omnipotent God (especially the God above laws of nature and logic many Christians advocate)? By the free will interpretation of evil I mean the theory which says that the evil there is on the world is a necessary result of us having free will to decide to serve God or to turn against him. The problem I see here is that if God's truly omnipotent (in the sense he can do even things we cannot imagine - the God above logic), there wouldn't be anything necessary since God could create us both perfectly free and good. 

Passions: cognitive emotions that involve judging something outside your control to be "good" (or "bad"), in the sense that they are what make your life (not) worth living. Passions are categorized as desire, delight, fear, and distress. Proto-Passions: subconscious emotional reactions and reflexes, that arise directly from your impression of a situation. These include reactions to physical pain, and spontaneously crying at the death of a loved one. Healthy Passions: cognitive emotions that involve judging something within your control to be "good" (or "bad"). These are categorized as wishing, joy, or caution, and include things like gratitude, affection for people, and a desire to help them. 

The neural algorithms are so complex we have no clue how does consciousness work for now. The problem is, consciousness is a different quality from anything we can measure with scientific tools. All we know is that it's closely related to our ability to learn, reason, remember and percieve ourselves. There are some attempts to explain it though - you could know the famous TED talk about the illusion of consciousness by the philosopher Daniel Dennet. Denett says that what we call consciousness is our brain's function to answer "yes" whenever we ask ourselves whether we have a consciousness. In that case, in evolutionary means, we can mainly study the concept of self. One of the simple philosophies trying to explain consciousness is panpsychism. Panpsychism is virtually a part of hinduism and buddhism and says that everything has some degree of consciousness and our mind is one of the emergences of unity of many little conscious things. A solipsist might say that the human mind is the only thing that exists and the question is thus the same as the question for the origin of the universe. Or that that the universe is what our consciousnesses invented to understand our inherently given qualia. Noam Chomsky might tell you that consciousness is the result of our ability to create digital infinities via language - our ability to process thoughts about anything. Either way, I haven't really seen a theory that would claim consciousness is not a byproduct of the evolution of intelligence or the other way around, and thus, has no evolutionary meaning. 

The Stoic call to action and kindness is famously illustrated by the Circles of Hierocles. We are taught to imagine ourselves at the center of a sphere of humanity, pulling everyone closer and closer to us, until we care about their needs the same as our own: 

3. Passions are Morally Problematic All this said, the Stoics do suggest that you may sometimes have to give up a competitive advantage in order to follow their way of life. In Seneca's famous essay On Anger, for instance, he cedes that anger may indeed sometimes be "useful." But not only is it a dangerous ally (anger, he emphasizes, is extremely difficult to control), but anger is fundamentally immoral: in Greek philosophy, anger is defined as a desire to get revenge for a perceived wrong. The Stoics didn't believe in vengeance. They believed that our response to conflict should be forward-looking: we can act to protect people, or to try and rehabilitate a criminal, but (following Socrates) we should always view even the worst of human beings as being infected by ignorance, the way a patient is infected by a disease. The passion of anger (as opposed to its related proto-passions or healthy passions), for the Stoics, is fundamentally vicious. Since the whole point of their philosophy is that we should never, ever, trade virtue for vice, they are more than happy to sacrifice whatever utility anger offers in order to maintain their progress toward good moral character. The same argument applies to every other emotion that the Stoics condemn. Passions are to be avoided, not just because they are unpleasant, but because by definition they involve a judgement that some external thing is valuable in the same way that virtue is valuable. And that, for the Stoics, is a dangerous idea: once we admit that moral character may not be the highest good—that there might be something of equal value to it—then we open a slippery slope toward rationalizing away our duties and commitments. 

A lot say that with every next step we make in science comes always a set of new questions. I think this means there's an infinite number of questions we can ask about the natural laws. And that means that nature is not governed by a limited set of laws we could write down and call the final theory. So does it mean that if the new-questions is correct, does it mean there's an infinite number of natural laws that we can never capture all? Am I missing something? 

In one episode, Doctor Who finds out he's trapped on a horror-like island and he finds out his time machine he could escape with is frozen in the hardest rock on earth. He also finds out that every time he dies, some kind of machine makes another copy of him, a copy with no memories of those findings. Every time he realizes that, he runs to his time machine and hit the rock with his fist a few times, just seconds before the monsters get him. From the constellation of stars, he finds out he had been there, dying and replicating, for some billion years. Now, from the utilitarianistic point of view, a torture lasting for billion years is the worst thing that can happen. And that makes sense from the physicalistic perspective because if we sum all the feelings of all the Doctors throughout the billion years, there's a hell lot of measurable (physical) stress hormones reliesed. But this statement assumes that pain + pain = 2 pains. That sounds quite reasonable but is the billion pains the Doctor had gone through really so much worse than a single one when the Doctor doesn't have memory of what happend before? My point is, is there some kind of "model of pain" that makes sense from the perspective of a physicalist, other from utilitarianism? (it doesn't need to be a moral model necessarily) Is there another way of materialistically evaluating a morality of something without simply adding and contracting pains and pleasures? 

Your concern is a common one, and a lot of newcomers to Stoicism report the same issue: they worry that their normal human motivational system is somehow being weakened or damaged by Stoic practice. People often encounter this problem when they focus exclusively on the "calm and de-stressing" elements of the philosophy, as you put it, but miss the Stoic call to value honorable behavior and to tirelessly pursue moral excellence at all costs. But on the other hand, more advanced Stoic practitioners sometimes report the opposite problem: ancient Stoicism's call to benefit others, to be politically engaged, to be a hard worker and an excellent provider for your family, etc., seems to demand so much focus, so much pro-social action, and so much diligent effort on their part that they fear it leads them to an unhealthy and unreasonable amount of "hurried energy to get things done." People encounter this problem when they (rightfully) interpret Stoicism as a radical system of virtue ethics, but leave its therapeutic elements underdeveloped and fail to recognize that self-care is also part of virtue ethics. 1. The Discipline of Action Stoicism is a Middle Way You phrased the question excellently: 

Even though qualia are generally considered to be unexplainable, there are philosophers like Daniel Dennett attempting to get to the core of consciousness with scientific methods. In his view, consciousness is an "illusion", on the physical base, created by our brains. But I think I don't fully understand what is meant by that. Let's say that the discovery could be made and we would be able to fully understand the phenomena behind everything we experience. Would we change the way we think about consciousness in the sense it wouldn't be considered to be a "supernatural" thing outside the laws of physics? With what we know, which is tones of expierence of consciousness, is it possible to say it's less real than it seems? I know his point isn't that consciousness isn't real (because the illusions surely has to exist for him to criticize :) but I feel like his philosophy implies qualia isn't real. And at the same time, it seems to me that I think, therefore I am. * has to be an axiom for any philosophical theory formulated in human words. So if someone managed to fully explain the illusion of consciousness, would it started to be considered a standard "physical" phenomenon (just like the theory of abiogenesis started to push more and more thinkers to leave the idea of divine intervention in the formation of biological life)? As for a non-philosopher (and Czech), it's hard for me to put my thoughts into words so please feel free to reword it if you think you've captured the idea. *_ Let's consider thinking a quale for sake of the argument (it could be any other quale) 

The goal of Stoic life, then—the only thing that truly has real value—is to live a virtuous life. That life may require shooting for any number of specific goals. In particular, we should strive to excel in our roles as a parent, friend, employee, specialist, leader, etc. Doing so is very important for Happiness, love of hard work is a virtue (specifically, a kind of courage), and one of our highest callings in life is to benefit others, including in material ways. These two things together—the indifference of external things, and the importance of working hard to make a positive social contribution—are a potent mix.
