As with all testing, we want to find problems, so we need to do things what will discover them. But we are also the test pilot, so we have to maintain safety. Essentially, we need to test every aspect of the bike. Even though a bicycle is quite a simple machine, the list of what and how to test is fairly long. The first thing to do, as mentioned in the question, is to systematically check that every part seems to be properly assembled and works, while the bike is on the work-stand or still in the workshop. So, as mentioned below, check the head assembly, the front and read brakes, the front and rear gears, the bottom bracket, the wheels. At this stage we are checking that every item is properly assembled and seems to work correctly. As @Criggie says, look at and wiggle everything. I find I need to explicitly carry out this step. Many is the time I've assembled a bike and discovered something later, because I had an interruption at some point. The next stage is test the bike by riding it. We need to maintain safety, so the first thing is to test basic brake operation. And of course we want to test basic gear operations. We'll be riding back and forth in safe environment, and so we'll be implicitly testing the steering (head set) at this stage. The first two things to test can be done together, then move on to the others 

Firstly, it must be said that what is safe depends on the woman's own behavioral history, and the state of the pregnancy. She certainly should not be taking up new active sports. Some competitive sports ban obviously pregnant women from participating, not through any risk to the woman or child, but because she has two advantages. She has a greater blood supply, and competitors are likely to "go easy". I recall this was the case when I played competitive squash. The mother of my children cycled (on a road bike) until month seven in both pregnancies. With her extra blood supply, she would leave me behind on the hills! She only stopped when her belly was hitting the top bar. It should be said that both pregnancies were completely normal. She did discuss cycling with her Ob, who agreed that since she was already a cyclist, she could continue, but that she should be sensible and stop if problems developed. She cycled about 60km (38 mi) in 3 or so rides per week. She did find her balance changed. By doing the activity continuously, she adapted to that. My recommendations are 

Good luck! Update Web searches show that cranks can be found in many non-standard sizes, such as 130mm. Some people will take longer cranks and cut them down to the size you need. I'm sure you'll be able to get what you need! The first step is to work out just what that is. Where your LBS could be of great help is working out what gearing you'll need with your short cranks. As you get stronger your needs may change, so keep up a good relationship with them. 

The difference between each gear at the top end (11 to 15 teeth) is between 6% and 9%. At the bottom end, the difference is about 10%, except for the "granny gear". Taking our narrow power band into consideration, and assuming we have 39x53 front chain rings, that means we'll be able to find a comfortable gear at a wide range of speeds. On the 39T chain ring, at 90 rpm (as an example; it's the ratios that matter, not the exact cadence): 

There is no substitute for riding a few different bikes to feel the difference. To get to do this, you'll need to develop a relationship with a local bike shop (LBS). A good LBS will let you take a bike for a short ride, and some will hire a bike to you for a longer ride. Explain what you want and what your budget is. Be up front that you're checking out your options, and you'll find your honestly repaid. Expect to pay more at an LBS than online, but that extra buys you a lot in future service, and bundled goods and services. Remember you'll need a helmet, shoes, and cycling clothes. Getting everything as a bundle will be cheaper overall. While tires can help with rough surfaces, the overall geometry helps with your general comfort. Consider if you will be comfortable with drop bars or if you want flat bars. A cyclo cross or touring bike may suit your purposes better than a top end race bike. Good luck, and feel free to ask specific followup questions! 

ARTICLE 1.3.011 (and related articles) of the UCI Technical regulations essentially says only a general purpose bike can be used for road racing (criteriums are road races). I interpret your aero bike to be a time trial bike. The rules explicitly ban such trials bikes from road racing. The reason for this is the lack of maneuverability. In practice you'll get much more benefit from sitting on the guy on front. See UCI CYCLING REGULATIONS PART 1 GENERAL ORGANISATION OF CYCLING AS A SPORT Especially 1.3.022 and 1.3.023. 

Start with short distances and gradually increase. Then when the family is into the routine of bike trips, add a picnic stop. Then find a nice camping location, either near home or near where you park the car, and ride by a longer route to get there. This way if something unplanned happens you are not far away. Make sure the kid(s) have fun. Perhaps plan a few interesting/play stops along the way. Also, with little kids, get into practice with taking as little as possible. For example when my kids were in nappies (diapers for Americans) we could take them for an afternoon trip with one bag. It measured 20 cm (8 in) X 15 cm (6 in) X 20 cm. The main extra stuff we took with them for ski touring was a change of clothes and food. Lots of food. Of course take the kind of equipment that you'd normally take on a bike tour. But get going, before they want to ride every where themselves. 

The problem many have with that is that the first part, build a good base of endurance fitness, requires long hours in the saddle (sometimes called slow distance rides, or LSD). The other way is championed by books (and many websites). The most famous book is 

Answering as a road cyclist ... For a ride of this duration (less than a day), before starting I take notice of the conditions, and decide what to wear, in how many layers. I want to carry a spare layer to put on during stops, and in case of bad weather. Usually it'll be my lightweight wind and (so called) water proof jacket. Sometimes it's just a windproof vest. I always start every ride carrying two full water bottles. I would expect to refill them somewhere on an all day ride. I have a mini pump clipped to the frame. I always carry 

The short answer is no, there is no standard equivalent for effort between distance and elevation. Of course, as others have mentioned, they are connected by the amount of effort you put in. But as you ride faster on the flat, the power required to drive you along rises as the square (some say the cube) of your speed. So riding 10% faster takes 20% to 30% more effort. This is mostly down to wind resistance, but rolling resistance plays a part too. On a hill, your (well, at least my) speed is lower. Lets say you're climbing at 10kph (6mph). So the wind resistance is way lower (less than 1/6th) than the resistance you would have at 25kph (15.6mph). The main work (5/6 of the effort if you're producing the same power) you're doing is levering yourself up the hill. If you go 10% faster then the wind resistance still rises by 20% or so, but the effort of getting up the hill rises linearly. So the point is, it's complicated. That's why there's no equivalence. This is why, if you look at Strava or other tracking apps, they distinguish distance and elevation. They also distinguish time in the saddle, because measures something else: endurance. For a real example, take a couple of my own rides. 

These things can take a long time to overcome. But sometimes the breakthrough can come quickly. Beware of becoming overconfident and trying to achieve too much too fast. Remember, she has spent more than half her life being afraid of cycling. Even if she seems confident, that fear will be lurking there for many years. Anytime she has another crash, her internal voice will be saying "see, you are right to be afraid". That internal voice is coming from a part of her that wants her to be safe. She has to convince that part that all those motivations she has are important to her growth and wellbeing. (This answer was written by me, then revised in conjunction with my wife :-) 

A person in normal good health could expect, with a little training, to ride 20 miles (32 km) before lunch and the same after lunch. So the entire trip could take four days. A fitter person on a road bike, touring bike, or similar, could do it in three days. A fit and seasoned cyclist would be aiming at two days. So such a trip is certainly possible. If you update your question with answers to the above points, I'll update this answer to respond. And probably others will chime in also. There are also other similar questions on this site that you can check out. Look under the tags on the question, eg long-distance. 

Bullying I am assuming that you are female, given that your screen name is Michelle. While there can be many suggestions about safe riding, the main point here is that these (male?) drivers are just bullying you. Plain and simple. One solution some cyclists use is to carry an obvious helmet camera, so that their behavior is witnessed. Edit: on rereading your question, I see that I did not answer the how to respond part. My response to this behavior is always to put on a big smile and wave vigorously. After all you have lots of friends: it must be one of them! Such a response seems to rob them of their power over you. And it feels good too. Take care out there. 

The article explains many details not relevant to this case. So, being a single-row deep groove bearing, it doesn't have an intrinsic orientation. If it had a cover fitted to one side then that would be the outside. 

There are multiple possible causes for this kind of pain. Of course, you should see a medical person in case something more serious is going on than our amateur diagnosis suggests. In general, this is a kind of overuse injury. This can have different causes (and each would have slightly different symptoms). Part of the reason is that you've taken a break and those muscles are just not as strong as they used to be. Common causes are 

The only way to be sure is to measure. You can use an app such as Strava during the ride, then look at it's analysis later. It will show you how fast you were going at each point, and also gives an approximation of your power output. We don't know what algorithm or assumptions it uses to calculate the power, but since it uses just one algorithm you can compare results for seated and standing sprints. Strava doesn't know what the wind speed is, nor does it know what your frontal area is (which changes when you stand), so the power values are not correct in an absolute sense. The speed measurements are more useful. I would expect that you'll be producing most power at the higher end of your cadence range, 120-140 rpm. In my experience a standing sprint is good for a short burst, rather than the extended acceleration you describe. Using the higher cadence will be better for your knees over time. 

There is no rule saying you must wait. But that behavior comes from understanding the sport's first principle. The UCI regulations say 

Commercial paint jobs often use heat-baked enamel, with multiple coats (not just undercoat and topcoat), and finished with a clear top coat. The baking process produces a really tough, well bonded coating, and the clear topcoat (as well as being tough) produces a nice finish that hides scratches. 

We cannot tell you what size cranks you need. Perhaps someone has direct or similar experience to help you with. If not, here's my advice ... In order of preference 

I agree with your diagnosis: it must be related to the rim tape. Take it off and inspect it and the rim below. If you don't find anything obvious, buy new, good quality rim tapes, check there are no sharp edges, and reinstall. 

To me, it's not an either / or choice. I would be aiming to get both, over the longer term. When planning to ride consistently through the winter there are also other considerations, some that help keep your feet drier and warmer (you may already be doing some or all) 

The point is efficiency. Cyclists actually have quite a narrow optimal power band. Most of us can bang away at a cadence of 50 rpm, up to about 90 rpm. Some of us pedal faster - 90 to 120 rpm. At those lower cadences (50) it feels like we're producing lots of power and at the high cadences it feels like we're just breezing along. But that is confusing torque with power. The optimal power band is where we produce most power most efficiently. How narrow is that power band? Take me as an example: 50+ years of road cycling, leg muscles well trained to buzz along at 100 to 120 rpm. My optimal power band is 105 to 115 rpm - on a flat ride I can do that for hours. If my cadence is dropping on a rise or into a headwind and I'm starting to grind, I know I'm down around 100. On a hill, after I run out of gears, if I can maintain a cadence of 90 or above I'm happy. But it's not as efficient. So there are three factors to consider: the rider, the terrain, and the wind. Terrain. On a flat road, close spacing gives us scope to choose the optimum gear. On a hilly road, we might want wider spacing at the bottom of the range to help with climbing. For MTB, AFAIK such a cluster would be unsuitable, but I'd welcome input from an MTB rider. Wind. On a circuit, wind is like hills. Except that we always seem to have a headwind. Whatever. In wind a cluster with wider spacing helps. The Rider. You. Where is your power band, and how wide is it? With training it will change. You'll hear many riders say that they "top out", meaning they couldn't pedal any faster (look at the tables below and see what that means). More factors come into it now: training and pedals. Pedaling fast takes practice, not just to pedal, but to do it smoothly so you don't bounce uncomfortably. And you have to be "clipped in" - no flat pedals. But I digress. A general purpose 10-speed road cluster for a strong rider might be 

If you can't see .TCX files then you'll have to dig deeper. From what I see the data can be stored in .TCD files, perhaps compressed a la zip. Install the Garmin Training Center Software and see if it can extract the data you need. Good luck. 

Unlike @Batman and @Daniel, I think it does matter. The bike should be stored with the gears set to the highest gear (the chain on the smallest cog), so that the spring in the derailleur is under the least pressure, and the cable is also under the last tension. So the cable will stretch less and the gears will stay in adjustment longer.
