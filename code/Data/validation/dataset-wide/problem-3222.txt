I think your answer is best illustrated with examples on a case-by-case basis. Sometimes the "middle-managers" would be known to Allied intelligence based on direct information gathering schemes. Other times some persons might be known to the individuals involved. For example, many of the events we'd call war crimes had witnesses- perpetrators, victims, and bystanders. Sometimes these individuals had the chance to speak out about their experiences. Lastly, the Germans helped in their own way as well: the Wehrmacht, the SS, and the Gestapo (like any other organizations) produced tremendous amounts of paperwork which could be examined and understood if captured by intelligence officers. They even produced paperwork that documented war crimes, because some such actions were sometimes ordered by higher authorities, and those orders leave a trail of documentation. A good example to look into would be the investigation of the Stalag Luft III murders. Stalag Luft III was a prisoner of war camp for Allied aviators. The prisoners there conducted a series of breakout attempts, the most famous one documented in the book The Great Escape by Paul Brickhill. This event resulted in 76 escapees, of whom 73 were recaptured and 50 were subsequently murdered as a warning to other prisoners not to attempt further breakouts. The investigation into these murders has been throughly documented. This event is somewhat unique in that a special investigative task force was tasked with solving just these murders, but the kind of investigation that ensued has common themes with others that occured during and after the war. I have only read the short description given in The Great Escape, but according to the wiki page above there are whole books and television programs about the investigation. My recollection about the investigation (which is inevitably going to be somewhat wrong) was that: 

Actually, I believe you are mistaken in assuming that being the emperor meant having all of the power. In reality, during the periods from ~1200 to ~1870, the Shoguns were the ones who really had the military power and effectively controlled the country. The emperor was basically nothing more than a symbolic figurehead during much of this time. The Kamakura shogunate (1192-1333) was the first of three major shogunates that controlled Japan during this time, and it was named for the city of Kamakura, which is where the Minamoto clan was headquartered. This shogunate controlled the military, administrative, and judicial functions, while the imperial government retained legal authority. This shogunate was formed by the Japanese warrior Yoritomo Minamoto, and his system of centralized feudalism would be the basic model on which future shogunates would build. The second was the Ashikaga shogunate (1338-1573), which was established by Ashikaga Takauji and based in the imperial city of Kyoto. Much of this period was marked by civil wars where feudal barons (daimyo) and Buddhist monasteries built up local domains and private armies, which eventually led to the undermining of the Ashikaga shogunate. The last of the three was the Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1867), which was formed by Tokugawa Ieyasu and headquartered in Edo (Tokyo). This shogunate was the most powerful of the three in that it controlled the emperor, the daimyo, and the religious establishments. In addition to this, they handled all Japanese foreign affairs. Each of these shogunates represented a military dictatorship that essentially rendered the emperor ineffective, so there really never would have been any real desire for them to want to "wear the Imperial Purple". In spite of that, there were occasions where a shogun would actually choose a different member of the Imperial family to circumvent the line of succession, and Ieyasu even made his son the ruler in the place of the emperor. 

This site: $URL$ contradicts your source, saying that the VT fuse was first "introduced" to the enemy by the U.S.S. Helena on January 5, 1943, resulting in the destruction of one plane. This phrase unambiguously identifies the first usage in combat- and given the similarity in circumstances it's possible that both your source and this source are referring to the same incident but one has gotten the date wrong. There are no in-line citations on this page, but the end notes cite: 

Databases such as the one you cite would have been useful tools for corroborating the existence of individuals and their positions within the German power structure, but there was a lot of old-fashioned detective work that went into bringing German war criminals to justice. 

The Allies first knew the murders had taken place because the remaining prisoners at Stalg Luft III were informed that 50 of their 76 comrades had been killed attempting to escape. This seemed outrageously high to the prisoners. The prisoner's suspcions were further confirmed when they were delivered the cremated remains of their escaped comrades. These urns were normally supposed to have the place of cremation as well as the name of the person, but some urns did not have locations and some of the urns that did have names were inconsistent with the official story they were told. The circumstances they were given- that all 50 escapees were shot while running away after being ordered to stop- made little sense. These were men who fully expected not to make it back to neutral or allied territory (one of the primary aims of the escape attempt was to tie up German units who would otherwise be contributing to the war effort). Once the gig was up, they would be expected to surrender specifically to avoid being shot and killed. After the war captured documents had shown that Hitler had ordered the murder of a large number of prisoners as retaliation for the escape attempt. These orders were passed onto Himmler, who in turn passed orders onto the local Gestapo branches in the areas where the escapees were caught. This provided a paper trail that fingered many of the invidiuals involved with the murders. During the investigation, the Allies found eye-witnesses who could corroborate when and where the recaptured prisoners were last seen alive, and in some cases who they were last seen with. These hints were critical in finding the right people to interrogate. The big break in the case came when a captured Gestapo officer was caught in a lie during many difficult interrogations. He was pretending to be someone who he was not. Once caught, the Allies knew he must have knowledge of some of these events, and he ended up fingering other members of the Gestapo who had been involved. Armed with this knowledge the investigators could then track down these other individuals- some of whom were still in custody and others who were still in Germany or the surrounding countries- and in turn get more confessions. The Gestapo had issued many of its people with fake identities to use in the event that Germany lost the war, so a difficult part of this investigation was matching who they already had in custody with their true identities. 

I found a rather lengthy discussion on this topic at the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. It points out that the concept is most likely to evolve between two culturally similar enemies. The shared values between these two sets of people will result in a situation where "they implicitly or explicitly agree upon limits to their warfare". The Introduction suggests that just war theory has a long history. It alludes to Homer's *Illiad" and the Bible as sources of examples. The article overall makes for pretty interesting reading. It even expands to discuss the concept of "just conduct within war", in which it basically states that if war is inevitable, there should be certain principles that should be adhered to by the participants. 

There are two things that the Mongols had to their advantage when they waged war, significant numbers and superior training and discipline. These two factors almost always ensured that they would have the upper hand in any engagement. I found one source that suggested that a typical military unit for the Mongols would consist of three major units. One unit would consist of 10,000 infantry and the other two would consist of 10,000 cavalry. Each of these units was made up of a number of smaller units, each with its own role. One unit of cavalry would attack at many different points along the enemy's lines, and then quickly retreat and regroup, preventing the enemy from being able to follow or sometimes even find them. The other unit of cavalry would ride around the enemy, encircling them on all sides so that they could not escape. The infantry consisted of a combination of foot soldiers and archers. The archers would help harrass the enemy by continuously pelting them with arrows. Then once the enemy started to wear down, the foot soldiers would charge in to finish them off in close combat. (This same site has a pretty impressive list of sources on their bibliography page.)

Large sums of cash were actually the instrument of choice in many applications. It seems strange and unsafe today, but there was usually no alternative. Depending on the amount involved you very well might hire a team of guards to safeguard you and your money as you moved, and you would be keen on taking advantage of things like hotel or train safes so you could avoid carrying it on your person as much as possible. If you were transporting a truly staggering amount of money you might very well accomplish it by filling up a safe and then shipping the entire safe between locations. One duty that involved shipping and handling large sums of cash was payroll- paying the workers of a company. Each worker had to be paid in cash, so this meant carrying enough cash from the bank to the factory or job site to pay every worker their (typically) weekly or bi-weekly wages. Payroll was thus a dangerous job to do. Whether the money was carried, driven via a horse/coach, or moved on the train, those large sums of cash were favored targets of bandits and criminals. Payroll was commonly transported via train where practical. There was a special car on trains called the "express car" whose job was to transport highly valuable articles such as cash or gold, and the people who guarded these cars were called "expressmen". Many of the daring train robberies you read about were targeted at these specific cars- some heists actually succeeded in detaching and stealing the entire car, leaving the robbers plenty of time to loot it of valuables.

Most of these meetings took place between the President (Nixon) and the National Security Council, and as a result the meeting minutes were considered classified. The book includes hundreds of CIA documents that detail the activities and involvement of the CIA which either directly or indirectly supported the coup. 

Looking at the Area 51 commitment page, I realized that some of the questions that were originally suggested there never got asked here, so I thought I'd add some of them. To expand on this question, was this transition a result of some military action, political influence, or external influences from other countires? 

From a purely historical perspective, I believe the term "America" has generally been applied only to the "United States of America". I have seen instances where the collective countries of Mexico, US, and Canada have been referred to as "the Americas" (note the plural). However, I don't believe there has ever been an instance where the term "America" by itself has ever been used to refer specifically to any other country exclusively. 

I found an interesting article that discusses this topic, and I believe it provided a pretty realistic explanation for this. Basically, it stated that the economic and diplomatic sanctions placed on Myanmar by the West had a major impact. The reasoning is not that the rulers of Myanmar particularly cared about the impact of said sanctions on the citizens as much as themselves. It suggests that those people who became rich through their involvement with the government had few places to invest their ill-gotten gains because the West is effectively closed off to them.
