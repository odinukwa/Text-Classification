You probably know all of this already, but here goes... Write $C'_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} p_{x,w} T_x$ where $p_{x,w} \in u\mathbb{Z}[u]$. Now, the other basis can be defined by applying the involutive automorphism $b: \mathcal{H}_n \to \mathcal{H}_n$, given by $b(T_w)=T_w$ and $b(u)=-u^{-1}$. 

Gauss defined the linking number of two closed curves $\gamma_i: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ with an integral. 

Alexander's Theorem guarantees that every oriented link is the closure of some braid. In other words, the map $$ \displaystyle \coprod\_n \mathcal B_n\longrightarrow \{\text{ oriented links }\} $$ is surjective. One algorithm (I'm actually not sure that it's Alexander's original demonstration) involves choosing a basepoint in the complement of a diagram for the link and applying Reidemeister moves until the resulting diagram winds around the point in a consistent direction, at which point the diagram is manifestly the closure of a link. 

The parametrization \eqref{2} can be deduced, quite laboriously, using Weierstrass elliptic functions and the product expansion for $\Delta$. However, when we clear the denominators, equation \eqref{1} (possibly) becomes an identity between modular forms and such identities should be easy to prove using the fact, that the space of modular forms has a finite dimension. Can this be done? What can we say about $\Delta(2\tau)$? It is a modular form with respect to some group? 

The curve $$(X-16)^3=XY\tag{1}\label{1}$$ is essential to Heegner's approach to the class number one problem for imaginary quadratic fields. We have the following “modular” parametrization \begin{equation}\tag{2}\label{2}(X,Y)=\left(2^{12}\Phi(\tau),j(\tau)\right),\end{equation} where $\Phi(\tau)=\frac{\Delta(2\tau)}{\Delta(\tau)}$. Note that the function $\Phi(\tau)$ is a Hauptmodul for the group $\Gamma_0(2)$. My questions are: 

Let $\mathcal M_m\subset M(2,\mathbb Z)$ be the set matrices with determinant $n$. The modular group $\Gamma$ acts on $\mathcal M_m$ from the left and we have the following finite set as a set of representatives of the orbits of this action $$\mathcal M_n^*=\bigg\lbrace \begin{pmatrix}a &b\\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix}:ad=m,0\leq b\leq d\bigg\rbrace.$$ Consider the modular equation $$\Phi_m(X,j(z))=\prod_{M\in\mathcal M_m^*}\left(X-j(Mz)\right).$$ It is straightforward to prove that this is actually a polynomial in two variables $\Phi_m(X,Y)$. Zagier shows in his notes, p. 71, that the leading coefficient of $\Phi_m(X,X)$ is invertible if $m$ is not a square. He also demonstrates that $j(z)$ is a root of $\Phi_m(X,X)$ if and only if $z$ is fixed by some matrix $M$ with determinant $m$. Zagier proceeds to show that for $z\in\mathfrak H$ a complex multiplication point of discriminat D, i.e. $Az^2+Bz+C=0$, $D=B^2-4AC$, $(A,B,C)=1$ the folowing two statements are equivalent: 

The first section of Representation Theory by Fulton and Harris is a great introduction to representations of finite groups (about a quarter of the book, if I remember correctly). There are lots of examples and exercises. The rest of the book is devoted to Lie theory. 

Background Inside the Temperley-Lieb algebra $TL_n$ (with loop value $\delta=-[2]$ and standard generators $e_1,\ldots,e_{n-1}$), the Jones-Wenzl idempotent is the unique non-zero element $f^{(n)}$ satisfying $$ f^{(n)}f^{(n)} = f^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad e_i\;f^{(n)} = 0 = f^{(n)}e_i \quad \textrm{for each } i.$$ Consider the Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_n$, $n\ge3$, normalized so that $(T_i-q)(T_i+q^{-1})=0$, where $q$ is generic. Let $\mathcal{I}$ be the two-sided cellular ideal generated by canonical basis element $$C_{121} = T_1T_2T_1-qT_1T_2-qT_2T_1+q^2T_1+q^2T_2-q^3.$$ The assignment $\mathcal{H}_n \rightarrow TL_n$ given by $T_i \mapsto e_i + q$ is a surjective $\mathbb{C}(q)$-algebra homomorphism with kernel $\mathcal{I}$. We can lift the generators $e_i$ in $TL_n$ to the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements $C_i=T_i-q \in \mathcal{H}\_n$. In fact, we have $C_{121} = C_1C_2C_1 - C_1$, hence the relation down below. Rescaling a bit, $E=-\frac{1}{[3]!}C_{121}$ is an idempotent, corresponding to the partition $(1,1,1)$. Actually, all of the primitive idempotents in $\mathcal{H}_n$ that correspond to Young diagrams with more than two rows live in the ideal $\mathcal{I}$. Now, any preimage of $f^{(n)}$ in the Hecke algebra (call it $F^{(n)}$) satisfies $$F^{(n)}F^{(n)} \equiv F^{(n)} \quad \textrm{and} \quad C_iF^{(n)} \equiv 0 \equiv F^{(n)}C_i \quad (\operatorname{mod} \mathcal{I})$$ Question 

You could use the usual device of assuming a Grothendieck universe: Mac Lane does this in [Categories for the working mathematician]. But actually you don't need that for the Yoneda lemma – you could just rephrase things so that there is no mention of the "illegal" category $[\mathbf{Set}, \mathbf{Set}]$. For instance: 

Makkai and Paré introduced the following binary relation on regular cardinals: given $\kappa$ and $\lambda$, $\kappa \vartriangleleft \lambda$ (read, $\kappa$ is sharply less than $\lambda$) when $\kappa < \lambda$ and, for every set $X$ of cardinality $< \lambda$, the set $P_\kappa (X)$ of all subsets of $X$ of cardinality $< \kappa$ has a cofinal subset of cardinality $< \lambda$. It is not hard to see that $\kappa \vartriangleleft \kappa^+$ for all regular cardinals $\kappa$. On the other hand, $\aleph_1$ is not sharply less than $\aleph_{\omega + 1}$, so $\vartriangleleft$ is not the same as $<$. Nonetheless, it is true that $\aleph_0 \vartriangleleft \lambda$ for every uncountable regular cardinal $\lambda$, simply because $P_{\aleph_0} (X)$ has the same cardinality as $X$ when $X$ is infinite. More generally, if for all (not necessarily regular) cardinals $\kappa' < \kappa$ and all cardinals $\lambda' < \lambda$, we have ${\lambda'}^{\kappa'} < \lambda$, then $\kappa \vartriangleleft \lambda$. In particular if $\lambda$ is an inaccessible cardinal then $\kappa \vartriangleleft \lambda$ for all regular cardinals $\kappa < \lambda$. Question. Do there exist uncountable regular cardinals $\kappa$ such that $\kappa \vartriangleleft \lambda$ if and only if $\kappa < \lambda$? Is there a proper class of them? 

When $n=2$, the map is an isomorphism and we have no choice. $$F^{(2)} = \frac{1}{[2]}(T_1+q^{-1}),$$ which projects onto the $q$-eigenspace for $T_1$. In other words, it is the idempotent corresponding to the partition $(2)$. 

Here's a recent example. $URL$ Adam McDougall constructs a "diagramless" homology theory that ends up being essentially equivalent to Khovanov homology. 

Since, $b$ commutes with the bar involution, this basis is bar invariant as well. Explicitly, $C_w = T_w + \sum_{x < w} (-1)^{\ell(w)+\ell(x)} \bar p_{x,w} T_x$. So $C_w = \bar{P}^{-1} P C'_w$ which seems hard to compute in general. 

The Euclidean ball takes up the most space in dimension 5. $V = \frac {8 \pi^2} {15} R^5 \approx 5.26\ldots R^5$ 

I remember attending a talk by Barbara Jablonska at Knots in Washington (2009) in which she studied a knot in a geometric, rigid fashion. As the direction of projection varies over $S^2$, she obtained interesting surfaces by looking at the locus of a particular crossing (if memory serves). Here's an abstract of the talk, but I cannot find anything published. $URL$ 

I have a question which is fairly elementary, but first I must provide relevant context. Without it, my question would seem rather arbitrary and scarcely interesting. Note also that my question can be answered without reading what follows. Let $j(\omega)$ be the modular invariant, $\Gamma$ be the modular group and $H$ the upper half-plane. Define $\gamma_2(\omega)=\sqrt[3]{j(\omega)}$ using the cube root which is real on the imaginary axis. Let $\tau\in H$ satisfy \begin{equation} A\tau^2+B\tau+C=0,\ (A,B,C)=1. \end{equation} By Class field theory the value $j(\tau)$ is an algebraic integer of degree exactly $h(D)$, where $D=B^2-4AC$. Since $\gamma_2(\tau)^3-j(\tau)=0$ one would expect the degree of $\gamma_2(\tau)$ to be $3h(D)$. But it turns out that, if $(A,3)=1$ and $3\mid B$, the degree of $\gamma_2(\tau)$ is also $h(D)$. Now I indicate how this result can be proved. Set $\varepsilon=e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{3}}$. It can be shown that for $\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ we have \begin{equation} \gamma_2{\left(\frac{a\omega+b}{c\omega+d}\right)}=\varepsilon^{ab-ac+cd-a^2cd}\gamma_2(\omega). \end{equation} This implies that $\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\tau)$ if and only if $A\omega=\tau$, with $A=\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ satisfying $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$, except when $\omega \equiv e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{3}} \ (\textrm{mod}\ \Gamma)$, in which case $\gamma_2(\omega)=0$. Next define \begin{equation} S(n,3)=\bigg\lbrace\begin{pmatrix} r & s\\ 0 & t \end{pmatrix}:rt=n,r>0,(r,s,t)=1,3\mid s,0\leq s <3t \bigg\rbrace. \end{equation} Let $\omega$ be in the upper half-plane $H$. Consider the polynomial \begin{equation} \phi_{n,\omega}(x)=\prod_{M\in S(n,3)}\left(x-\gamma_2(M\omega)\gamma_2(\omega)^{-n} \right). \end{equation} It takes some work to show that the coefficients of this polynomial are invariant under $\Gamma$, and therefore rational functions in $j(\omega)$. After additional work we conclude that they are in fact polynomials with integral coefficients. In this way we get a polynomial $\Phi_n(x,y)\in \mathbb Z[x,y]$ such that $\Phi_n(x,j(\omega))=\phi_{n,\omega}(x)$. Applying a suitable substitution we obtain another polynomial $\Psi_n(x,y)\in \mathbb Z[x,y]$ satisfying for all $0\neq z \in \mathbb C$ 

I apologize that this is vague, but I'm trying to understand a little bit of the historical context in which the zoo of quantum invariants emerged. For some reason, I have in my head the folklore: The discovery in the 80s by Jones of his new knot polynomial was a shock because people thought that the Alexander polynomial was the only knot invariant of its kind (involving a skein relation, taking values in a polynomial ring, ??). Before Jones, there were independent discoveries of invariants that each boiled down to the Alexander polynomial, possibly after some normalization. Is there any truth to this? Where is this written? 

In modern terms, this measures the degree of the Gauss map $\Gamma(\gamma_1,\gamma_2): S^1 \times S^1 \to S^2$. See $URL$ 

In fact, if we replace $\lnot A$ by $A \to q$, then the above derives $p \to ((p \to q) \to q)$ from axioms K and S. It's not surprising that this is derivable from K and S alone: it is easy to verify that $\lambda x . \lambda y . y x$ is a lambda term of the required type. 

There is a topos $\mathbf{Set}[\mathbb{T}]$ containing a "conservative" model of $\mathbb{T}$, i.e. one where everything that is true is also provable. By Barr's theorem, there is a surjective geometric morphism $\mathcal{B} \to \mathbf{Set}[\mathbb{T}]$ where $\mathcal{B}$ is a boolean topos with the (internal) axiom of choice. Note that $\mathcal{B}$ also contains a conservative model of $\mathbb{T}$. 

So, when is $\mathbf{U} \subseteq \mathbf{U}^+$ adequate for the category scheme $\mathbf{Set}$, if $\mathbf{U} \in \mathbf{U}^+$? We take it as given that $\mathbf{U}$ and $\mathbf{U}^+$ are transitive models of ZFC. The first condition implies that this extension has no new subsets, and if there are no new subsets, there are no new functions either – so (1) holds if and only if the extension preserves powersets. By considering explicit constructions, one sees that equalisers are preserved, and as soon as we know (1), products are also preserved. We may then use the monadicity of $\mathscr{P} : \mathbf{Set}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ to deduce that colimits are preserved, so (1) implies (2). In particular, directed unions are preserved, so it follows that $\mathbf{U}$ embeds as an initial segment of the cumulative hierarchy of $\mathbf{U}^+$. What about (3)? Well, take a $\mathbf{U}$-set $I$ and a map $X : I \to \mathbf{U}$ in $\mathbf{U}^+$. By replacement in $\mathbf{U}^+$, we can form the disjoint union $\coprod_{i \in I} X(i)$, and if (3) holds, the cardinal of this set is in $\mathbf{U}$. Thus, $\mathbf{U}$ must actually be embedded as a Grothendieck universe in $\mathbf{U}^+$. Conversely, if $\mathbf{U}$ is embedded as a Grothendieck universe in $\mathbf{U}^+$, then (1), (2), and (3) are easily verified. But are Grothendieck universes enough? For instance, it would be good if the following were true: 

Caveat lector: This does not address your questions directly, but I think that it's interesting and somewhat relevant. The $n$th Catalan number counts the number of walks of length $2n$, beginning and ending at the origin, in the positive cone of the root lattice of type $A_1$. This counts the dimension of the invariant subspace of endomorphisms of $2n$-fold tensor power of the standard irrep $V$, relating back to Scott's answer. This phenomenon generalizes to other root systems. 

1 Many important properties of topological spaces are preserved by continuous maps (but not necessarily open maps): connectedness and compactness come to mind immediately. But more importantly, the most familiar, natural maps that we can define are continuous, but not necessarily open: polynomials $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$. 2 Inverse image of a subgroup under a homomorphism is a subgroup. 3 There is a contravariant functor from the category Set to itself, mapping a set $X$ to its power set $\mathcal{P}(X)$ and sending the morphism $f:X \to Y$ to the inverse image $f^{-1}:\mathcal{P}(Y) \to \mathcal{P}(X)$. A "purely symmetric" function would be a symmetric relation on $X \times Y$, no? Functions are, after all, relations with an extra property that deliberately breaks the symmetry! 

What I'd like to know is if there is an algebraic proof that 2 implies 1. Here is a cheat proof: it is well known that flat morphisms locally of finite presentation are open maps, so $\operatorname{Spec} B → \operatorname{Spec} A$ factors as an fppf monomorphism $\operatorname{Spec} B → U$ followed by an open immersion $U → \operatorname{Spec} B$; but fppf monomorphisms are isomorphisms, so we are done. This proof is unsatisfactory to me because (a) it involves a scheme that is not known to be affine a priori and (b) the well-known fact about flat morphisms locally of finite presentation being open is (to me, at least) a deep result in scheme theory. (Incidentally, is there a good name for ring homomorphisms corresponding to open immersions? I want to say "open localisation", but that's misleading because they are not necessarily localisations...) 

Thus if $0\neq z \in \mathbb C$ is a root of $\Psi_n(x,x)=0$ then we must have for some $\omega$ and $M=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} r & s \\ 0 & t \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in S(n,3)$ \begin{equation} z=\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(M\omega) \end{equation} and consequently by the fourth paragraph \begin{equation} \frac{a\omega+b}{c\omega+d}=\frac{r\omega+s}{t} \end{equation} where $a,b,c,d$ are integers such that $ad-bc=1$ and $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$. Hence $\omega$ is a root of a quadratic equation with integral coefficients, and if $n$ is suitably chosen, then the middle coefficient will be divisible by $3$. Conversely if we can find $\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$ and $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} r & s \\ 0 & t \end{smallmatrix} \bigr) $ with these properties, $\gamma_2(\omega)$ will be a root of $\Psi_n(x,x)=0$ On the other hand the roots of the equation \begin{equation} x^3-j(\omega)=0 \end{equation} are \begin{equation} \gamma_2(\omega),\ e^{-2\pi i/3}\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\omega+1),\ e^{2\pi i/3}\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\omega-1) \end{equation} If we could guarantee that the only common root of $\Psi_n(x,x)$ and $x^3-j(\omega)$ is $\gamma_2(\omega)$, then we would know that $\gamma_2(\omega)$ and $j(\omega)$ had the same degree. But if $A$ is not divisible by $3$, $B$ is divisible by $3$ and \begin{equation} A\omega^2+B\omega+C=0,\ (A,B,C)=1. \end{equation} then it is easy to see that the numbers $\omega + 1$ and $\omega -1$ satisfy quadratic equations whose middle coefficients are not divisible by $3$. Therefore $\gamma_2(\omega)$ is the only common root and we are done. Finally, my question is this: given $\omega\in H$ such that $\omega^2+3\omega+\frac{9-D}{4}=0$ where $D\equiv 5 \ (\textrm{mod} \ 8)$ and $D<0$ is not divisible by 3, how can I find $n\equiv -1 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$ and $M\in S(n,3)$ such that $$A\omega=M\omega$$ holds for some $A=\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ satisfying $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$?
