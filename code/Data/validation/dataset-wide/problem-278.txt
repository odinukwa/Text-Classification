This question reminds me of a game I used to play: "If you had to change one thing to cause the apocalypse what would it be?" My favorite was always getting rid of friction. Too many fun ways to die with that one. So maybe pray to god for that? Or if you have to do it all on your own (prayers didn't do much...), you could break into a biodefense lab and throw a few vials into the wind at each major airport. If you were smart enough you could engineer HIV to be a deadly airborne disease. I'm sure that kills pretty much everybody. 

There's almost certainly more points I haven't considered here. Definitely make sure it's consistent though. Cultures tend to bleed across political boundaries for example. Edit: I talked with an armor smith. A major additional point under the military bullet is the fact that you live in your armor at war, so ceremonial/tournament armor would be designed differently than war armor. 

GIMP/Photoshop can actually pull off every necessary transformation of that data set using built-in filters, if your willing to give up accuracy a little bit. Just think out the connections you want to model. The one's it can't model, you could script in or use other software (one example being measuring insolation. I don't know of a way in standard GIMP to make a shadow map from a height map. QGIS can automatically do this for you though). TimB's great series of questions on world-building will probably end up covering more than you care to model but: 

Assuming everyone has access and is now immortal you'll probably have suicide become legal, childbirth regulation, and maybe even government culling. I pretty much agree with the other answers on the other points. 

Such a tree has existed in our imaginations. The question is what shape would this tree take? Building a bigger Venus Flytrap 

Fireworks are designed for beauty, not for damage. Many years ago, before lighting became so practical, mankind was mostly in the dark at night. Kings and other land holders would hire a pyrotechnician for celebrations and as a demonstration of their power. The display of fireworks would dazzle and delight people and remind them subtly the ruler had the power to illuminate the night sky. This is why so many celebrations in our society are celebrated with fireworks. Independence Day, New Years Eve, sporting events all have fireworks that light the sky. Beyond offering a demonstration of power, fireworks make poor weapons because they emphasize color over power and that color actually retards the destructive potential. Fireworks and destructive weapons like a cannonball are both powered by black powder, but they use it in remarkably different ways. With fireworks, they use black powder mixed with powdered metals for color and other pyrotechnic compositions for an emphasis of color over effect. 

Rockets Red Glare Lets take the example of a rocket. A well-designed pyrotechnic rocket will used compressed black powder and titanium to create a trail of sparks as it powers the rocket into the air. This makes it a terrible offensive weapon because as it streaks into the air, it creates a trail that leads to the launch location and exposes your position. 

JavaScriptCoder dramatically changed this question after I came up with an answer The original question was how to make cyber war lethal. I even addressed issues with a military-only option before the question change. It is my belief that cyberwarfare will not be clean or tidy. Once it starts, civilians will die. 

The truth is in reality we could have an all-robot war tomorrow - ICBMs and cruise missiles fit almost every definition of a robot. Of course, although in such a war it would be robots carrying all the weapons, huge numbers of humans would die as well as the robots being destroyed. In the book "Arms and Influence", Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling advances the view that there are two things a military can do to accomplish a country's goals in a conflict: 

For day-to-day home use, a lot of the power of modern computers is spent on making things look nice and providing abstractions that cut software development costs. You and I could exchange this message just as well over teleprinters. So things like banks and electronic payment networks could survive; the terminals used in shops would get simpler, and banks could maintain their centralised systems for a long time by making their software more efficient and buying up old computers on ebay (where they would presumably become a valuable commodity) There would be a few years of great business for companies that sell prints of your digital photographs, sell physical maps, and things like that. I suspect people might retain something similar to personal computers, as for a lot of stuff having people do things online is more efficient than mail or phone. That might take the form of a shift to 'dumb terminals' with time-sharing access to 'mainframes' although they might be re-named to 'cloud desktops' or something. As the vintage, high-performance equipment got older resources would get more constrained, as the chips we were able to make would cost more per unit performance. We might not be able to use all the bandwidth of high-bandwidth undersea cables. I suspect that would lead us to a more austere, hierarchical replacement for the internet. No more videos or photos posted to social media by hurricane survivors - perhaps only major news organisations would have access to that much bandwidth. There would be political and business implications for this stuff, of course - expensive bandwidth would increase the power of the press and those who own/control them; and a move towards mainframes would make snooping and industrial espionage easier. 

Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Another existing power source is the Radioisotope thermoelectric generator. The positives are this can be created with no moving parts. The drawback is a low power yield. $URL$ Thermovoltaic A Thermovoltaic generator captures the light given off the thermal source and translates that into power. The positives are that thermovoltaics provide consistent and reliable power without large amounts of fuel. The drawback is that they are not very efficient. If your power source was in a sphere of thermal-voltaic cells, you could run them in series to produce the energy you need. Perhaps in your world, there's a more efficient source of thermovoltaic cells, which could produce the 8,000 watts of desired power. $URL$ 

What you really want exists, it's called a tracer round. A tracer round works like a bullet sized flare. The tracer projectile is filled with a pyrotechnic flare material, made of a mixture of a very finely ground metallic fuel, oxidizer, and a small amount of organic fuel. It burns at several thousand degrees. If fired into dry brush or grass, it will start a fire. There are three types of tracers: bright tracer, subdued tracer and dim tracer. The dim variety will give you the heat you need. They come in armor piercing varieties, but honestly if armor piercing is your thing, there's better projectiles. 

The biggest hindering factor in building tall buildings is useable floor space. Elevator shafts, stairways, support structure all take away from valuable floor space available for offices. Economics was a deciding factor in many buildings and most of them are only supposed to occupy a city block. One other limiting factor, which still is in place today, is the rope used for elevators. There's a finite length to what is useable. To go up 900m, you could not create a cable durable enough for that height. So you would need to create a series of elevator shafts to allow what height that can be achieved. In the case of the Washington Monument, you have a building where construction started in 1848 and tops out at 555 feet tall (169m), but no floor space. The monument is filled with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, elevator columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports the weight of the stonework. If these are not factors in your building design, then the sky is the limit.
