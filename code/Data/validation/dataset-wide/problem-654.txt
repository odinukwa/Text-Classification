I swapped out both tubes on my mountain bike with Presta (less chance of crap getting in to the valve and it means I can carry the same CO2 inflator as I do on my road bike) and got the bushings - once they were in I've had zero issues with the valve stem. I'd definitely recommend putting one in since there's the chance that the valve stem could rub against the edge of the hole or the tube could even prolapse through the hole. I have two of the Presta to Schrader adapters, mostly in case my CO2 inflator dies and I need to try and fill from a gas station (it happened once and I didn't have 'em). Just walk into your favorite B&M store and they'll probably have 'em in a container on the counter. I think I paid just over a dollar apiece. If you're really concerned about losing it you can screw it onto the Presta valve and leave it there; just make sure the valve is screwed shut before you thread the adapter on. 

I agree with Mike - the first time I come off the rollers and hit the road I can definitely fell the difference in my form, particularly with my cadence. They're great as an adjunct to regular season cycling, too, since they really force you to concentrate on a smooth pedal form (if you're "pushing" the pedals as opposed to turning them you'll surge back and forth). I'd recommend starting up next to a wall or in a doorframe since it'll take a little while to get used to balancing on them and staying in line on the rollers. Don't give up - we've all fallen off them. And definitely check out the range of rollers available; I have some nice Action Mag aluminum smooth rollers with an adjustable flywheel on them, but you can do what you need to do without a lot of the add-ons (and add them on later, too) As far as getting boring, I usually listen to music, either on an iPad strapped to my arm (so I can flip through my play list) or on the stereo. If you're just starting out I'd suggest avoiding watching TV and concentrate on a spot about two feet in front of your front wheel. Sounds weird, but it helps keep you straight. 

I do not know what you mean by "on budget". Commuting 25+km one way throughout the year, I stopped experimenting with e.g. low tire pressure on otherwise unmodified bikes, or using cheap bikes during winter. Considering the (economic & health) risk you take with minimum modified, on budget bikes, I recommend to switch to public (or other means of) transportation to stay on budget. For winter biking, IMO cost savings should not be highest priority. Otherwise you pay the price when you get hurt, hurt others, or end up with damaged equipment. The only way for me to be / feel as secure during winter as without snow and ice are studded tires. If your winter conditions are as light as I understand, the rim brakes on your commuter bike should be OK. However, especially when the daily temperature variation allow ice to melt and freeze again while your bike is parked, those brakes can become hard to use. And I would spend some money on lights, which will be battery lights if you are out for cheap. 

I drive the same Rohloff for over 8 years and do not see an end of its lifetime. I cannot speak for other brands, but in all posts above the free-of-charge service by Rohloff, as part of their special corporate culture was not mentioned. Up to now, whenever there was a problem, the thing was being send to Rohloff and I had to pay nothing. That being said, yes there are some problems worth mentioning and I assume these can apply to other internal gears as well: 

In order to protect your hands and feet, I recommend some sort of active heating. If my hands are clumsy from a lack of circulation, or if my foot gets frost bites, the other issues discussed are of secondary concern to me. Basically, there are three types: 

The standard route I take for commuting has only few asphalt kms, most of it is gravel or worse. A road bike wouldn't be as suitable (fun, enduring, ...), even though it is not a problem to use one for this route. Personally, I would never consider a road bike because I like the versatility of biking. In summertime, I might change the route to one that leads through the woods, in the wintertime, my standard route can require spike tires. Somehow, using spikes, to me, corresponds with using a MTB and not a road bike. IMHO, if you want to bike on roads only, a road bike is OK. In all other cases you will end up with a non-road bike. I cannot imagine a biker who would stop riding a MTB because she's on a road, whereas most road bikers would rarely use their bike off road. Hence, this "sort of" answers the quantitative part of your question: the percentage of MTBers using their bike on a road is higher that the percentage of road bikers using their bike off road :D 

a) Is the headset tight? Over time that can loosen up and it'll start to lean in one direction or the other (usually based on which side of the pothole you just hit). b) Are your wheels true? this probably won't make a major difference but it might combine with the previous point. c) Is the weight on the bicycle evenly distributed? E.g., do you wear a messenger bag across your left shoulder so the weight of the load pulls the bike in that direction? d) Does this happen in a parking lot as well as on the road? Don't forget that streets aren't flat - they curve off to the edges to allow water to shed from the roadway (and into nice deep puddles for motorists to drive through and splash cyclists). If it only happens on the road (and you always ride on the right hand side of the road) it's probably because of Gra-vi-ty. 

You might also want to consider a used bike - you'll be able to get more for your money and if / when stuff wears out you can upgrade it as you go. 

They're heavier, hotter (vents would do the opposite of what you're trying to do with an aero helmet, which is to route air up and over the helmet), and it's more difficult to turn your head (it doesn't completely prohibit turning your head but you lose the benefit of the shape as you turn it off-axis) so you have to depend on peripheral vision more. Plus, if you wear one on a bike path while towing a kiddie stroller federal law requires all other riders (including small children riding Huffys) to treat you with "derision and scorn". 

As long as your front derailleur matches the number of gears on your front chain ring (2 or 3) you should be okay. That being said, you may run into issues with different manufacturers or groupsets working well together. Are you using the same make / manufacturer in the front and rear? (e.g., I know Shimano makes both a 9 and 10 speed version of the 105 groupset and I am fairly sure the front derailleur is the same). 

This can be a regional thing, but here in Germany, many are happy with Ballistol applied as aerosol and not changed during the seasons. From a material science perspective, its viscosity is very low and has little temeprature dependence. It is also said that it is environmently friendly, to the extend that you can use it on pets, which I never tried as I found chains on my bike much more suitable. 

Some (most?) manufacturers recommend running studded tires on pavement for the first miles to facilitate "seating". As my commuting route touches little pavement but woods, I see little chance to do this "seating" for 50 km as e.g. Nokian recommends. With a Nokian Extreme, I was not able to see a difference in spike positioning before and after the 50 km seating process. Hence, I am wondering: 

As always, each type has its pros and cons. @1 pro: can last for up to 6 hours, thin enough to fit everywhere con: not reversible, needs some initial heat & oxygen, which, at times, results in some time until heat is generated @2 pro: usually the cheapest alternative, after treatment with hot water, the material becomes liquid again and is ready for reuse con: to have substantial heat, you need some volume of the material, i.e. it cannot be used in shoes, it can be too thick to be able to fine tune your breaking power (it might not even be legal according to traffic laws to use them); usually, the heat is generated for (only) around 1 hour, i.e. for longer times, you have to carry additional pads @3 pro: you can switch these on and off, and depending on the type, can adjust the heating power in between con: depending on the exact product, you have to fiddle with additional cables and storage of batteries. In your case, I'd check electrical heating, but try the coal/metal heating pads first. However, I doubt that the coal/metal heating pads would generate sufficient heat at -50 Â°C. This also means, I'd check that the heating power of the electrical system is "exceptional". 

heating pads that generate heat from oxidation of a metal-coal powder heating pads that generate heat from a liquid-solid phase transition that is triggered by pressing a small metal that floats in the liquid phase electrical devices that contain thin wires 

You're aware of the fact that as long as you know what the thread pitch on the bolt is that you can just buy one with a hex / philips / security / whatever head, right? Pull the bolt (try and remember where all the various springs, washers, etc. landed when you pulled the bolt out) and take it down to your local Fastenal / OSSCO bolt / whatever and just get a replacement with whatever head strikes your fancy (if it's pan head or flat head you may have some issues getting a hex head bolt to fit because of the inside taper). Or, if you have a thread pitch gauge, you could open your McMaster-Carr catalog and order it from them. Of course, without knowing the exact alloy the bolts are made of you're probably voiding any manufacturer's warranty by replacing a functional section of the brakes. But, hey - if your brakes fail you could always just ram into a tree head first, right? That'll stop you. I, too, am curious as to why you're adverse to an allen head - the hex shape creates a better (more points of contact) grip and it's a standard tool. They're easy to toss into your saddle pouch or pocket of a bike jersy, too. And it's a lot easier to torque them down to a manufacturer's specification than a philips head is. 

Dumb question - I'm assuming you lined it up with the old one and got a rough length before you put it on? Yes, width is usually the major issue when doing the 6 -> 7 -> 8 etc. move, but it could be that it's too short (pulling the rear derailleur up too high) or too long (they will often include a couple of extra links in these chains). I usually lay the new one out next to the old one and make sure that the length is approximate (the old chain will, of course, have stretched from use to you want to keep that in mind). If I'm feeling particularly anal retentive I'll count the links out (which is, I believe, the recommended method).
