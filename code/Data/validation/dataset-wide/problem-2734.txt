I've recently watched the documentary about Nietzsche's life and philosophy Nietzsche: Beyond good and evil and I got that one of the main ideas in his philosophy is that people should spend their life enhancing their self-knowledge and self-cultivating. According to the documentary, this idea had been crutial for Freud's and Jung's philosophy so I believe it could have had much impact on the thinking of society. Does the saying "be yourself" and everything that comes with it, come from the Nietzsche's philosophy from Human all too human? 

The perception of time seems to be a quale as every other else. Though, the unique thing about it could be that it's actually measurable. People regulate their drowsiness by objective factors like light. There's a well known experiment conducted by Michel Suffre on himself in 1972 - when he spent a month with no light and no information about the time, his time perception, along with his sleeping cycles, has twice slowered. This experiment indicates that our perception of time is heavily interwined with our bodily (objective) sensation but as our thoughts, it seems to have the characteristics of a quale. On the other hand, there were experiments with similar goals that were about to find out wheter people percieve time slower when they're falling from high on a trumpoline but they didn't. Similarly as the studies on changes of our time perception during our lifetime, this experiment shows us that our time perception might be often a thing of our memory - this would indicate time isn't even a quale at all. When I watched the movie Arrival, I realized it wouldn't actually be possible to share one's perception of time - just as it's not possible to share our speed of time. Though - it seems to me that perception of time is unique in its ability to be shared to a certain extent. Could this be the interface of consciousness and the physical word? Aren't we actually sharing our qualia when we consider ideas such that the time used to run slower when we're young? I think the similar reasoning logic be applied for thoughts - which might be why some philosophers doesn't consider them to be a quale. What does it mean for the philosophy of consciousness to actually have such interface? Is there any similar dimension of sensation on the border of shareable sensations? 

According to the Google NGram, it was about this time when the phrase started to be frequently used in literature. So I guess that the origin of the phrase "be yourself" is so complex we can't really ascribe the authorship to a single philosopher, even though there's a good chance Thayer was the one to spread the phrase (even though he didn't have to be the first to come with the idea of meaning of life as cultivating and getting to know yourself). 

[major edits] Even if our consciousness is an illusion (even in the sense Denett suggests), the mere fact we see some information flowing across the universe means there is at least something that creates the illusion. That something is real - even though it might be only as real as a hallucintion (it exists). And if we can make our thought constructs, we can work with this information that makes what we are. The obvious problem here is that if we think about our minds being simulated, we cannot see into the logic of the "real" world (world outside the Matrix). That's because in our world, we know that we can simulate only logical things (nothing illogical exists=is real) but we cannot know this is right from the "real" world. But clearly the mere fact that we can think about this concept of the "real" world means something in our logic system. So let's assume the logic we know indeed governs this universe. From this fact we know that our thought constructs (what we think consciousness is) are real (/hallucination-real). And if our thought constructs are real, than cogito ergo sum is real - our simple logic "if something exists, than it exists" (Hilbertian axiom aâ†’a). Doesn't it prove that if our logic system is true, than we exist? I understand this might be an awfully broad question, so I'll be grateful for any references. 

Probably not, even though Nietzsche might have had some kind of share for the idea to widespread and root deeply into the Western pop-culture. First of all, I've realized that the saying "be yourself" substantially relate to the question of a person's identity. On one side, the urge to live authentically had become one of the main topics of decadence where the role of Nietzsche's thoughts is, indeed, undeniable. On the other hand, I guess his popularity might had been a consequence of the growing corresponding moods in the society. These growing moods might even have had their roots in the philosophy of naturalism. I've searched through the Google books to find the oldest mention of the phrase "be yourself" and the first to actually relate to the context we understand it in today might be the Socratic dialogue between a "Christian" and a "Socianist" in Christianity and modern infidelity: their relative intellectual claims compared written by Morgan, W. (Williams) in 1854. The two of the debaters invastigate how can our surrender to God be consistent with the urge to be free. At the same time, people were affected by the biological knowledge that had lead to naturalism - that we are determined by our biological predisposition (Hippolyte Taine). This might have lead to the urge to fulfill your predisposition which is pretty much what lies behind "being yourself". Here, the writer, dealing with the contradiction of having free will and surrendering to God had, in fact, captured the basic question of self-identification: 

Of course, there's a difference between a "quale" (singular of qualia) as used by philosophers and an "sensation" as used in medical circles. As a doctor, I could precisely describe the sensation of "green" from your retina to your neocortex but I'll never be able to describe your sensation. Thus, we can't measure how much does my "greenness of green" differ from yours. And that is true about my "saltness of salt" and "harmony of a major chord" as well. But the perception of the speed of time is the same thing as our quale of the speed of time since if we assume we all have a consciousness that percieves time, it's really nothing we can sense in other way than as a physical quality - as the time we guess that has passed between a moment A and a moment B. 

The reason I couldn't understand the time-speed quale was that when I wanted to understand the quale coming from one sense, I imagined it as percieved by another sense. So I imagined that I percieve what I call sound as what you call sight and thus my "tones" and your "colors" are interchangeble. Therefore, it's hard to imagine what the speed of time is supposed to actually mean - because speed of time is all the other qualia combined. And we have no other way to percieve life than through time! But we can still make a metaphore: Imagine you percieve time as a sequence of words that represent what you sense. Someone else might percieve it as a sequence of images. (Spoiler to Arrival incomming) Take the aliens from Arrival who percieved time as a space, where people can be only at one place at a time and can move only in one direction, in the constant speed of 60 min/hour. So I'd consider time-speed perception a quale but still a specific one because we don't really have a specialized organ for percieving it - it's a combination of our awareness, frequency of experiences we remeber and our tiredness (directed by the amount of light around us) and thus, arises in the brain (which is similar to another controversial quale - thoughts). 

I have to oppose others' answers little since I feel like you're rather interested in the practical implications of definitions like those. The problem of defining happiness isn't that it's subjective but that we cannot study it properly (it's a quale). If we could define (=describe) qualia in the same sense we can define things in science, we could share things like if my red is the same as your red but since noone has come up with any comprehensive theory of consciousness because noone could come up with words (=axioms) in a language that would allow us to imagine the concepts clearly enough to understand others' consciousnesses as well (that would mean we'd have the real definition of consciousness - a definition that allows you to know the concept well enough to theoretically add toghether atom by atom and stop when consciousness arises). There are no "official definitions" of words. Definition of a word is only useful if we use it somehow in the context - that's why philosophers discuss it so often. And in sociology, that means we want to know where they live a life of the best quality, in medical ethics it means we want to know who's conscious of what's happening to him and wheter it releases dopamin or whatever in him/her. But that doesn't mean we understand what happiness is, that means that we can reduce it enough to consider it in our decisions. 

Recently, I advocated utilitarianism based on consciousness on Change my View subreddit and I was quite suprised by the opposition against the bare idea of a universal moral system. From my limited observation, those who think in such way argue by the role of "emotions" in our decisions as opposed to "cold reason". In my opinion, this view is determined to fail, as it introduces our animal perception, evolutionary built to generate a constant flow of naturalistic fallacy arguments, as a universal moral judge. I think those moral dilemmas where utilitariansim is taken to the "extremes" look as dilemmas just because they are emotionally strong enough for us to feel bad about logically the best option, even though it can be calculated it'll bring more goodness whatever that is (5 random people's happinesses are more than 1). So is it philosophically/logicaly tenable to refuse a universal moral system in general? 

Note that the context of the debate (the new religious "fidelity" and critique of the stifling religious institutions) seems to be very similar to the context of Nietzsche's philosophy (this notion supports the consequence-hypothesis mentioned earlier). The first definite mention of the phrase "be yourself" in the given context can be found in Ethics of Success written by William Makepeace Thayer (not to be confused with W. M. Thackeray) in 1893 (just five years before Nietzsche's Human all tooâ€‹ human!). We can see Thayer has written a very clear formulation of the current understanding of the idea you should "be yourself" (in a chapter called "be yourself"). Thayer makes the point we should live honestly so we could always speak honestly, a point very similar to those that can be seen in contemporary psychological literature. Thayer even quotes the naturalist George Crabb (1754-1832):
