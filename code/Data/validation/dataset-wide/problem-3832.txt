The paper I linked above discusses the history and the role of Hilbert's problems and I think is worth reading. Most of mathematical logic, as we know it right now, did not exist when this question was asked and you can simply disregard the question by saying "this is not a mathematical question". On the other hand, the same could be said about the second problem on the consistency of arithmetic today, if mathematicians did not develop the necessary tools to deal with this problem. My point is that one might be able to answer Hilbert's 24th problem if one finds the "correct" statement of the problem. With our current knowledge and understanding of mathematical logic, can we define a criteria for a proof to be "simple"? Have there been any attempts to define such a notion? Should "simple" merely mean "short"? In Thiele's article, you can find some quotations in Section 5 but they do not really give any useful information about how Hilbert perceived the word "simple". Having stumbled upon this article only today, I admit that I have not searched for other articles yet. So I would also appreciate being directed to other books and articles on this cancelled 24th problem. 

In theory, yes. In practice, probably not. Unless you believe that you will hit a giant wall and the universe will collapse while you are counting after some $S^k0$ where $k$ is the $k$-th iteration of successor operation, you do not have anything to worry about consistency of $PA$. If natural numbers exist (whatever this "means"), then $PA$ is consistent. On the other hand, you might want to take a look at Edward Nelson's position on this. There are ultrafinitists around who believe that the set of natural numbers, as a completed infinity, does not exist. If you have worries about the natural numbers, you might want to think about the following question as well: Maybe natural numbers, as a completed infinity, does exist (in the Platonic universe of mathematical objects) but our formalization of it in mathematics is not the correct one, that is, it is not arithmetically sound. For example, $PA$ might be formally inconsistent but consistent in reality, so it does prove $\neg Con(PA)$ but it does not prove any actual contradictions in real life. This is in some sense a weakening of your worry that there might be something terrible going on with $PA$. To go another step further, you can consider the possibility of $PA$ being correct about $\Sigma^0_1$-sentences, but it proves incorrect statements about more complicated formulas etc. 

Let $f: 2^{\mathbb{N}} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$ be the function given by $$ f((a_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}) = \text{the equivalence class of }\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{b_k}{2^{(k+1)!}}$$ where $(b_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}=(a_0,a_0,a_1,a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots)$. Notice that a real number of the form $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{c_k}{2^{(k+1)!}}$$ where $(c_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} \in 2^{\mathbb{N}}$ is rational if and only if the sequence $(c_k)$ is eventually zero. Consequently, $f((a_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}})=f((a'_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}})$ if and only if the corresponding sequences $(b_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $(b'_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ are eventually equal if and only if $(a_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}=(a'_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$. Finally, compose this function with your favorite explicit injection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. This gives you an injection from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}$. If you want to find a $\mathbb{Q}$-linearly independent subset of $\mathbb{R}$ of size continuum, consider the image of the map $g: \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by $$ g(S)=\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{\chi_{S}(k)}{2^{(k+1)!}}$$ where $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{N})$ is an almost disjoint family of size continuum. For example, enumerate the vertices of the full binary tree of height $\omega$ by $\mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of (labels of) branches. To see why this set is linearly independent, see this nice answer of Tim Gowers on another MO question. Note that both of these constructions can be done in ZF. 

Proof. Let $f$ be such a Borel map. In particular, $f(x)=f(y)$ whenever $g \cdot x = y$ for some $g \in Fin(\mathbb{N})$ where the action is given by permuting the indices. For each rational $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, define $A_q=\{x \in {\mathbb{R}}^{\mathbb{N}}: f(x) < q\}$. Let ${\overline{\mathbb{R}}}^{\mathbb{N}}$ denote the product space where $\overline{\mathbb{R}}$ is the space of real numbers endowed with the discrete topology. Lemma. For any $q \in \mathbb{Q}$, either $A_q$ or $A_q^C$ is meager in ${\overline{\mathbb{R}}}^{\mathbb{N}}$. Proof. Pick some $q \in \mathbb{Q}$. Then, $A_q$ is also Borel in ${\overline{\mathbb{R}}}^{\mathbb{N}}$ and hence has the Baire property. Let $U$ be an open set such that $A_q \triangle U$ is meager. Each $g \in Fin(\mathbb{N})$ induces a homeomorphism of ${\overline{\mathbb{R}}}^{\mathbb{N}}$. Then, since $f$ is producing the same element for sequences that are in the same orbit under the action of $Fin(\mathbb{N})$, $g[A_q] \triangle g[U]=A_q \triangle g[U]$. So, each $A_q \triangle g[U]$ is meager and so is $A_q \triangle \bigcup_{g} g[U]$. If $U=\emptyset$, then $A_q$ is meager. If $U \neq \emptyset$, then $\bigcup_{g} g[U]$ is dense and it follows that $A_q^C$ is meager since $(\bigcup_{g} g[U])^C$ and $\bigcup_{g} g[U] - A_q$ are meager. This completes the proof of the lemma. $\blacksquare$ Now, let $S$ be the set of all rationals $q$ such that $A_q$ is meager in ${\overline{\mathbb{R}}}^{\mathbb{N}}$. $S$ cannot be $\emptyset$ or $\mathbb{Q}$ by the Baire category theorem. Let $z=sup(S)$. Then, since $\bigcup_{s < z} A_q \cup \bigcup_{s > z} A_q^C$ is meager, $\{x \in {\mathbb{R}}^{\mathbb{N}}: f(x) = z\}$ is comeager, and hence dense by the BCT. But then, $\{x \in {\mathbb{R}}^{\mathbb{N}}: f(x) = z\}$ being dense implies that it has an element starting with $z$. $\blacksquare$ From the proof it can be seen that if we weaken the uniformity condition on $f$ so that it produces the same element for the sequences that are $Fin(\mathbb{N})$-equivalent, we still cannot diagonalize in a Borel way. The most general version of this theorem is the following 

Here is a theorem of Hjorth, Kechris and Louveau which might be of some interest. Theorem: Let $E^X_G$ be the orbit equivalence relation induced by a Borel action of a closed subgroup $G$ of $Sym(\mathbb{N})$ on some standard Borel space $X$. Then the following are equivalent: i. $E^X_G$ is essentially countable. ii. For some Polish topology $\tau$ on $X$ giving its Borel structure, $E^X_G$ is $\mathbf{\Sigma^0_2}$ in $(X,\tau)^2$. iii. For some Polish topology $\tau$ on $X$ giving its Borel structure, $E^X_G$ is $\mathbf{\Sigma^0_3}$ in $(X,\tau)^2$. (This is Theorem 1.12 in Jackson, Kechris and Louveau's paper "Countable Borel equivalence relations" and the following papers are given as references for this theorem: Borel equivalence relations induced by actions of the symmetric group, Borel equivalence relations and classifications of countable models. Or, you can check out Chapter 12.5 of Gao's book Invariant Descriptive Set Theory.) This theorem provides plenty of examples since the isomorphism relation on the standard Borel space of countable $L$-structures is given by the logic action of $Sym(\mathbb{N})$, where $L$ is a countable relational language (see Chapter 3.6 of Gao's book). For example, the isomorphism relation on finitely generated groups is essentially countable. Of course, even though you might consider these examples "natural", you should keep in mind that we are actually changing the topology without changing the Borel structure, so the topologies which make these equivalence relations $\mathbf{\Sigma^0_3}$ might not be "natural". 

Although the question has an accepted answer, I will post a forcing-free proof of this fact that uses the Baire category theorem. The theorem Joel proved is originally due to Harvey Friedman and is a special case of his "Borel diagonalization theorem" that he proves in his paper On the necessary use of abstract set theory, Advances in Mathematics, 41 (1981), 209-280. The following proof is from the appendix of this paper. 

According to Theorem 1.3 of Survey of odometers and Toeplitz flows, the kernel of a topological group factor map from $G_{\mathbf{k}}$ to $G_{\mathbf{k'}}$ is $G_{\mathbf{k}-\mathbf{k'}}$. Here $G_{\mathbf{k}}$ is the odometer corresponding to the supernatural number $\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}^+} \text{p}_i^{k_i}$ with exponents $\mathbf{k}=(k_1,k_2,k_3,\dots)$, i.e. it is the inverse limit of the system $\mathbb{Z}_{a_1} \leftarrow \mathbb{Z}_{a_2} \leftarrow \dots$ with $a_i | a_{i+1}$ and $\text{lcm}(a_i)=\prod_{i \in \mathbb{N}^+} \text{p}_i^{k_i}$. Moreover, two odometers are isomorphic as topological groups if and only if their associated supernatural numbers are the same. Consequently, any topological group factor map between isomorphic odometers has trivial kernel. One can also prove this for dynamical system factor maps by turning these into topological group factor maps via rotation by the image of $\mathbf{0}$ (or, you can check Lemma 11 of this paper). It turns out that any measure-theoretic factor map between odometers (equipped with the Haar measure and the transformation $w \mapsto w + \mathbf{1}$) is equal to a dynamical system factor map on a full measure set. See Proposition 10 of this paper for a proof of this result. Thus any measure-theoretic factor map on an odometer is injective on a full measure set. 

All that being said, you do not have to choose your metatheory to be ZFC. As Joel pointed out, much weaker theories may suffice depending on what you want to prove. You may already be aware of all of these. Perhaps you were only using the word "informal" to mean that axioms of ZFC are not formal objects as sets. The only reason I wrote this answer is that your use of the phrase "informal set theory as their meta theory" reminded me of the confusion that I quoted at the beginning and created the impression that there is something wrong with ZFC. 

Hilbert's 23 problems, ten of which were presented at the 1900 ICM in Paris, are too famous for any mathematician to not know. If one reads the descriptions of the problems in Hilbert's paper, one realizes that some questions are concrete whereas the others are stated somewhat vaguely. The 24th problem that I will quote below definitely falls into the latter category. It seems that there was a 24th problem which was "cancelled". The following is from an article that appeared in American Mathematical Monthly in 2003. 

For any closed subset $K$ of the usual Cantor set $\mathcal{C} \subseteq [0,1]$, consider the map which sends $K$ to the set $K \cup [2,\infty)$. Then this map explicitly reduces the problem of classifying closed subsets of the Cantor set up to homeomorphism to the problem of classifying closed non-compact subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ up to homeomorphism. The classification problem for closed subsets of a Cantor space up to homeomorphism is known to be pretty complicated. More specifically, it is as complicated as the classification problem for countable graphs, or say, countable linear orders up to isomorphism. (These claims can be made precise using the notion of Borel reducibility. You can find the relevant theorems in this paper. But I doubt that you are looking for such technical details.)
