A quick way, is to just have a little look. If a new chain meshes nicely and there are no funny sounds or any skipping when it turns, then it's good to go. Sheldon Brown has some examples of worn cogs and how to spot them here. 

V-Brakes and calliper brakes operate with different lengths of cable being pulled. V-Brake levers pull a lot more cable and in this set up, your lever throw will be too sort to be usable and have very little stopping power. Sheldon, as usual, has more. You can get adapters to go the other way, road levers with v-brakes, but I've never seen one go this way. Your best bet would be to look for some flat bar levers for the calliper brakes you have. Almost any sold as a road lever should work. 

Yeah, no one else does. 99% of people are pretty friendly, the 1% you don't need to care about. PS. That said, a half decent pair of shorts and a jersey will help you fit in and make you a little more comfy, a double win. Save the shoes for later if you come into some money or decide it's time. PPS. Not the Strava jersey, they're very pricey, my current ones were about $50 and I thought that an extravagance. Spend more on shorts, a good chamois is worthwhile. 

I've been riding with a lot of people with some fairly non-standard gear. Some of it has raised eyebrows, like the guy starting a mountain bike rase without brake blocks, but on the whole no one cares. It's usually more embarrassing for the guy with deep pockets and small legs. 

Send that wheel back where it came from. I can't see enough to have a better answer, but if your wheel has gaps in it then I wouldn't ride no matter who made it and how. 

Most of these adjustments are time consuming and a hassel, or need you yo carefully buy new parts. If this is bike has a derailler then your chainline is never going to be correct anyway and I wouldn't worry about it. So, to answer your question, the frame tends to set a lower limit to the chainline in the front and an upper limit in the rear. With careful component choice you can always make a good chainline (most framebuiders are unlikely to stick a 73mm BB on a frame with 120mm rear spaceing, I would guess). 

A polite nod, wave or smile usually suffices. It doesn't need to be much, where I live in the UK raising one or two fingers from the steering wheel is plenty when driving. Not sure about down south, I've heard it's a fairly local thing, but I don't imagine it being too different. 

This is a fairly standard looking crank, chainrings should be readily available in a variety of sizes. When I searched on the specs the pictures and listings didn't match, so you'll have to measure to be sure what you have in front of you. However, you might want to actually try riding the bike as it is, turning your legs at a fairly standard 90 rpm is around 40kmh with the top existing gearing. 

Stick the bike in a sturdy stand. Remove the wheel. Squeeze the levers a few times to get the pistons sticking out a bit. Don't go too far as dropping a piston out is bad news. Push them back in. Repeat as necessary. 

You should be able to buy single spokes for this wheel. The model number for the current Ultegra wheels is Y4FP98130 according tothis. What year are your wheels?? 

At 3:30ish in this video, they set light to a front derailleur. Why? Degreasing it? Waxy lube that needs melting in? I can't think of a good reason. Any ideas? 

To tighten, turn the way the wheels turn when you're moving forwards. To loosen, turn the way the wheels turn when you're moving backwards. This works for both 15mm spanners and the assorted hex down the spindle designs you see these days, with no confusion possible.) 

They're called Travel Agents and are used to change the cable pull of a brake lever so you can mix and match brake styles. 

Sounds like a sticky piston to me. These can be a real pain to sort. To get the unstuck you remove the wheel, and push the pistons in and out a handful of times. 

Just had a quick look at their site, there doesn't appear to be anything too special about these that'd cause problems. However, it doesn't look like they sell frames on their own. If you're changing to a frame from another brand then you'll have to make sure the following things are the same. 

Chris Froome caused a stir this year at the Tour just sitting on his top tube and that looked sketchy enough at 100kmh, twitchy and uncomfortable. 

Larger tires and lower pressure will help a bit, staying out of the sake is good for your bum. Other than that, your going to have to grin and bear it. 

These are to protect your frame from the support bolt on Shimano front derailleurs (I don't know if SRAM have the same). You can see them on page page 7 of this manual. 

This listing has it down as an Orbit C33 SL ACB. I can't read German beyond getting the gist, but that looks to confirm your suspicions. I believe the SL and ACB are just the materials / tier of product and C33 is size. 

This is really only a question you can answer for yourself. How fit are you? How much do you ride currently, is 11 miles a long way for you? Are you comfortable in London traffic? Is it raining? These questions, and others, you will need to answer before you get close to an answer. Personally, I'd do it, I chose 2 points on the map in London at random and it shows about an hour by bike, an hour by car and 30 mins by train. As for clothes, you may find that your office has a shower or changing room and you can change from something in lycra to something more office friendly when you arrive. Failing that, a lot of people recommend baby wipes. There's other questions about commuting with a lot of information on this. 

I've never seem an adapter for either of these situations. I doubt one would fit. That said, a lot of manufacturers use the same hub body on their through axle and QR wheels and are more than happy to sell you the bits that are different. I had this problem when I got a pretty good deal on some wheels with a 15mm front hub. In the end, after a month or two of looking, I found somewhere with a non tapered 15mm fork in stock and bought that over rebuilding the hub. The best way, is to choose wheels that fit out of the box! PS I found this adapter for a 15mm QR on a roof rack, not sure I'd like to ride it... 

Whenever I go somewhere new on my bike, I like to check Strava's Global Heatmap. You can easily see the routes that are most common and if you drag the little yellow fella down onto a road you can see what the road is like too. This is most useful for finding nice roads that a lot of people ride, for major climbs, look for a segment marked HC in the regular way on Strava, but you need to be logged in for that. 

You need a large allen key, often an 8mm to tighten that centre bolt right down. It'll pull the crank arm onto the spindle and secure it. The LH-FSA-AL ring is the self extracting bolt, the internal hex bolt pushes on the back of it to pull the crank off without extra tools. That has a left hand thread so that it doesn't unscrew as the internal bolt unscrews. It only really needs to be tight enough to stop it from coming out, finger tight probably isn't enough though. You need a pin spanner for this which is a pretty specialised tool, I've certainly never had need to buy one, so you might want to pop down your LBS and ask them to tighten it up.
