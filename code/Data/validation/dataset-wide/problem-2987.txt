Socrates was finally sentenced to death because his judges declared that he spoiled youth by his teachings and that he learned other Gods. But what precisely did he teach? 

Using mathematics a lot of 'laws' of nature are discovered, like the Higgsboson gravitational waves Diracs anti-matter etc. But if something like mathematics can predict how nature or reality 'should be' and is what does it say about the nature and reality. I sometimes think that if mathematics is usefull than the reality is perhaps symmetric and in balance or something like that. But is maths just putting a model on nature and you will find what you are looking for with the instruments and maths you use or does it really say something about nature? 

For a lot of feelings it looks clear to me that a thought preceded it. Like when I think of the possibility of war I get afraid. But imagine the case when it is very cold, is the feeling of having cold preceded by the thought that it is cold or could you feel cold without thinking about it? 

I think it is a kind of idealism like that of Berkeley. But can this statement also belong to phenomenology of Husserl or of the philosophy of Kant or is there perhaps a better philosopher for this? 

According to his theory there is only one substance and that is God/Nature. But if God is only good can there be any evil or bad behavior etc.? 

If some first-order statement is true in every domain larger than a domain D, then it is true in D. But this is only true if D is not the empty set. Philosophically, we want our statements to be true of all sufficiently large domains of discourse, but this theorem says that including finite ("small") domains of discourse does not change things. However, including the empty domain of discourse would change things. It's easy to tell anyway whether a first-order statement is true for the empty domain. So it seems unnecessary to include this in our theory when we can just handle it as a special case. 

One of the most fundamental debates in the philosophy of mathematics is a debate about what mathematics is. Your question ("What makes an object mathematical?") might be understood directly from understanding, "What is mathematics?" I would therefore suggest you begin by reading the SEP's list of the four main schools of thought. Each school answers the question differently. For example, to a logicist, an object is mathematical if it is simply a statement in some logical system. Thus, the first and third of your examples are certainly mathematics, and the second might be also if "socrates", "mortal", and "man" were axiomatically defined. A statement is mathematical if its content (meaning) can be defined in purely logical terms. Bertrand Russell defined mathematics thus: 

Analytical: A definition in which we plumb the logical depth and the essential characteristics of the underlying entity are analyzed. For example Euclid, provides the definition of surface as (Euclid, Elements, Book I) 

Usage-driven: A definition explaining the context, conditions or situations when the defined entity is used. For example: 

GPDS definition (Genus Proximum and Differentia specifica): Is a definition that outlines the key differences (Differentia specifica) between the entity to be defined and a proximal genre (Genus Proximum) in whose logical width the defined entity is included. For example: 

This is fine for finite-dimensional vectors (as it is mentioned in the definition). Sometimes such assumptions are not mentioned and the reader has to wary. By connotation: Definition by connotation outline the main and most important characteristics (this is subjective of course) of the entity to be defined and intentionally omit other attributes. An example is the definition of lizard from thefreedictionary.com: 

Determination of a number of elements that belong to the set we define A recursive rule or formula using which all other elements of the set emerge An explicit or tacit assumption that the set contains no other elements. 

By Enumeration: This kind of definition examines the logical width rather than the logical length of the underlying entity to be defined. The definition is carried out by referring to the elements of the defined set one by one. For example, we say that one-digit numbers are the numbers {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}. Interpretational: A definition is interpretational when it analyses the semantics of the entity to be defined. For example from the free online dictionary, one definition of weight is 

Premise (1) may seem to be preposterous from the outset to many traditional mathematicians and laymen. But in the context of nonstandard analysis, premise (1) is in fact perfectly reasonable and true. Likewise, (2) is certainly true. The problem is in the meaning of "different". 

A cone is a sum of infinitely many cross sections. If we cut the cone at one cross section, the cross section above it and the cross section below it must be either the same size, or different. (2a) If they are different, then the cone must change size significantly at this exact cut, i.e. it has a "step", which seems false. (2b) If they are the same, then every cross section is the same as the next one, so no cross section can differ in size from any other cross section, and so the cone is indistinguishable from a cylinder. This seems false as well. 

For an n-ary function symbol, there are k^n elements of the domain; for each one you need to choose one of k elements to send it to. So the total number of possible function interpretations would be k^(k^n). For an n-ary relation, you have 2 possibilities for each of k^n possible n-ary lists. So what would be the total number of possible relation interpretations? 

I would summarize this to say that there are clearly practical reasons to exclude the empty domain; this isn't to say that these reasons are natural, but I would guess Quine is more concerned about what is practical than about what is natural. In R. M. Martin's 1965 Of Time and the Null Individual, it is actually proposed that we introduce a "null individual" to our logic. As best I can tell, the effect of this is that the empty domain can be discussed, and that essentially the same logical theorems hold true for the empty domain as held in classical first-order logic. Whether you consider this to be justification for leaving the empty domain out in the first place is another matter. Perhaps the "null individual" is little more than an artificial way of making the empty set behave as if it were nonempty. But perhaps it makes sense philosophically to say there must always be a null individual x for which statements such as Px and Qxx can be written, even if we do not assume that this null individual actually exists; in this way we avoid the problems the empty domain could pose for logic, but at the same time we avoid assuming a priori that at least one thing exists (for the whole point of the null individual is that it is not considered to exist). There is some other discussion in A Note on Truth, Satisfaction and the Empty Domain, Timothy Williamson, 1999. 

In the early days, atoms existed according to Democritos. I think Democrites just hypothesized this to build up his world view. Probably there would have been also philosophers who claimed that everything was divisible to infinity (was perhaps Aristotle such a person?) But when asking in nowadays physics it is said that elementary particles can't be divided anymore, because the just decay in certain given other particles. But is this view of nowadays physics the truth? There are muons electrons quarks and neutrino's which can't be divided anymore. But why should this be true? Why can't a particle be split into infinity? Ok, it is probably hard to do so, but is there a more profound 'law' which does state this view? 

Because God wants us to be totally involved. So human have free will, can talk, behave and act; God wants our cooperation, because for a relation two persons are needed. Nevertheless God can give us something that we did't ask for, but this isn't always the case. 

There is time as an interval between two events but you could also state that time itself has a certain duration (it passes). Now in physics it is not always very common to see time as something that has a duration. ' So to make that statement solid one should find a way to work it out that it is an illusion but how can you do that? 

Quine's short 1954 paper, Quantification and the Empty Domain (Journal of Symbolic Logic, Vol 19 Number 3 September 1954), addresses this. Quines two reasons are: 

In practice, however, doing mathematics is much more complicated, and logicists will have to concede that it is only after a lot of work that a field of math is reduced to purely logical terms. Intuitionism, formalism, and predictavism, as well as the more ancient platonism, have their own things to say. My own opinion is that an object is mathematical in the same way an object is physical: it is observed as a pattern in the real world. Thus I would say that all three of your examples are mathematical, the second and third merely being special cases of the first generic scheme. To clarify, mathematicians usually abstract away irrelevant details and focus in on very specific properties of things; so "Socrates" and "Mortal" are replaced by general concepts, and so "pile of rocks", "stack of coins", and "organism of cells" are all reduced to the abstract entity called a "set" (and, in these cases, a finite set). 

From the perspective of nonstandard analysis, one can come up with a different answer that is in some ways more direct. In this context, the two opposing surfaces (circles) that are formed when the cone is cut are NOT in fact equal, but differ by an infinitesimal amount. Here is this analysis in more detail. I paraphrase Democritus' paradox as follows: 

Hegel explains in his works how the Geist is evolving during history towards a kind of consciousfreedom. It seems to me initially that in the end our own minds has evolved to a rational God, but I'm not sure of this. But in what religion is the interpretation of a God similar to the definition of Geist according to Hegel? 

Robots can become very intelligent. So suppose in future they are there and looks and behave a bit like humans. What question could be asked by which you can decide whether it is a robot or not? 

Descartes teached that because he thinks therefor he is. But did he tell something about the question whether there are gaps between thoughts? So probably we could not exist between those gaps? Or wasn't it possible not to think or was thinking just a quality a human posesses? 

Perhaps more a physics question, but there is also a philosophical question why physics validate all measurements as the same. Of course one could ask why should one particular measurement be the only 'real' one. Of course this is all about special relativity. But a bit in line of Ockhams'razor one could also suggest that the measurement with the less variable parameters should be the most right one. But if one measure the length of something with a ruler just laying it besides it, it should be a more accurate measurement of the length of something than of the measurement of a observer in motion relative to that length. But in physics both measurement are equal in validity according to SR. Only light is absolute. So the question is, isn't a measurement with less variable parameters not more accurate than one that is depending on the observers'conditions? 

By convention: A definition that intentionally restricts the range of the defined notion to a particular field of application. There are numerous such examples in science. For example in mathematics an in particular in Finite-Dimensional Analysis one can find the definition that inner product is the binary relation: 

In terms of what, in brief (since it's not directly relevant to the question but it's important in order to understand what follows) a definition may be: 

Realistic: When it defines a tangible being in the sense that the definition refers to the object rather that to the word we use to describe it or its reflection in our mind (conception). Conceptualistic: When the defined being is a concept or our concept about a being. Nominalistic: When the defined being is a word and the focus is on the e explanation of the word (etymology, meaning etc) 

Contextual: A definition from the context, formally having the structure "Def(Q): Not P Then Q" (Definition of Q). Example: 

By Recursion: Well known in mathematics. For example the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively. It is a sequence whose first and second elements equal 1 (x1 = x2 = 1) and all other elements are retrieved from the formula x(k+2)=x(k+1)+x(k) for k=1,2,... Constructively, we say that a recursive definition consists of the following: 

Constructive: A definition that provides a way to generate the defined object. Implicit: The singleton {0} is implicitly defined as {x|x^2 + 10*x^4 = 0 and x is real}. Operational(ist): The defined entity is what accrues from a measuring procedure, either physically and practically or merely mentally and only that. An operational(ist) definition runs something like that (hypothetical quotation): 

With levels I mean different 'perspectives' on a subject/happening. For example, all things have color. When we see a green tree we say this tree is green. So from this level the tree is green. But for a physicist the tree has no color it only appears as a color but in fact they are waves reflected by the tree are 'mentioned' green. So for a phycisist only waves 'are'. Now there is a mathematical physicist and says, no that are no waves that are fields and vectors and a string-theorist says that the tree is a bundle of strings. And perhaps even a synesthesist would say the tree is color 6. Perhaps you could go on and on. The question is now whether these 'beings' are valid or not. Can 'beings' who are not really contradictory be all true in their own field/level or -is- there a real being what prohibit the other beings? See also min 34 $URL$ 

Some people like to live in the moment, or in the now. That is possible a more psychological way of interpreting a moment. But physically seen, does this contain a time lap? So is it actually possible to live in the now? Or is the Planck time (5.39 × 10 −44 s) the time lap which defines 'now'? Or when it is 17:00 h, does that moment has a time lap? Perhaps mathematically it could have a now, because 17:00 seems to be very exact. But in practice, regarding special relativity, a clock can't indicate the time precisely 17:00 because that would also imply that there is an infinite number of decimals which due to all motions can't stay zero. Or can they?
