As far as mathematical options go, the best ones I know have already by suggested. I will suggest a different option, used by the Spartans. The Scytale. Basically you wind your medium around a rod and write along the rod. When the medium is unwound you get nothing but shuffled letters. The description in Wikipedia makes this most basic implementation appear easily breakable. While I am no expert, I suppose a few twists could be added: Don't align letters with stripes. If you always place your letters on the stripe perfectly, you have nothing but reshuffled letters. This is easily breakable, by statistical analysis of the letter frequency. Instead use very, very thin stripes, so that mere dots are found on each, offering no clue to which letter they belong. This might be difficult to reproduce by hand, but Heinrich will let a machine do the winding for him. Very neatly and reproducibly. Don't use a simple rod In the event that the stripes are found, the cryptanalyst will have the patience to test all kinds of rod diameters. Therefore, don't use a rod of fixed diameter, but rather a complicated shape, similar to what you get by spinning an elaborate key around the long axis, or the ones found here. Disguise the data as everyday objects Unfortunately, I do not know the shape and size of 19th century sewing spools, so I will take today's situation as a guide. If I had enough trusted technicians, I would use sewing yarn, or something resembling it as a medium. I would manufacture a machine typing on the yarn, while it is of course wound around the intricately shaped rod. It would type in tiny letters, wind and unwind the yarn for me and reading would be easy with a magnifying glass. When storing the data, I would wind it on an ordinary spool. I would take care to leave some yarn blank, so the outside of the yarn (when on an ordinary spool) would be blank and inauspicious. If my typing/printing technique is good enough, I can even hide my yarn inside Gobelins, carpets, clothes, for longer travel. Problems Yarn has an axis of rotation. To avoid that becoming a problem, you must have the ink seep through the yarn. That might be difficult to achieve uniformly. And you must leave blank layers, to avoid damaging layers below. 

My answer would be Massively scaled stellar mining rig/barge/station (Mining star matter) so fast that leave it for a day or two you'll notice changes happening in the star... But we can go better... You have warp technology right so why not warp stellar matter using hawking radiation(black hole) to another enemy of yours? suck the star of its matter and throw that matter to your enemy! Not only it could collapse a star since it will be missing alot of its mass since you are warping it away but hit another enemy as well with it! Imagine a star being pulled apart and its mass being sent to your enemies! It will not go supernova(as far as i know) but you can be sure that they got nothing on your stellar sized plasma flame thrower... Since this is a galactic strategic weapon price shouldn't be an issue constructing a warp ring enough to engulf atleast 10% of the star or 1% for that matter depending on how fast you want the star gone or your enemy gone... take your pick! 

Stop the current crusade/jihad from advancing further Cull extremists from both sides Establish yourself as a prophet of a 'God of light' and establish a religion Destroy the validity of both Christian-esque and Islam-esque religions not with overwhelming military/fire power but influence and if possible economics Establish a pantheon of false(nonexistent) gods to denounce Christian-esque and Islam-esque further. Destroy all scriptures of the 2 religions Convert most(60%) of the population to your church, and you shall name it 

There are 2 series(Records of a fallen vampire, Muv-Luv unlimited) that i read a while ago about this topic, it doesn't only stop rockets from flying(This also included SLBMs launched from Atlantic, target was an island in japan), anything generally larger than 10 meters is shot down mid air with the use of LASERs The lasers were used by aliens in those 2 series. Aliens from RoaFV used meteors to strategically place their laser turrets all around the world(They camouflaged it). The gov't didn't know it was laser turrets. And when they knew, they cant even destroy it due to its molecular armor BETA(Beings of Extra Terrestrial origin which is Adversary of human race) has laser class that has pin point accuracy that the moment you surpassed 100m off the ground you have 5 seconds to go below it to evade a laser salvo from this little aliens they also have extra ordinary range too and virtually can target anything they see. Taking an idea from this scenario. An efficient but very effective laser can be used in near future with the current fad of bleeding edge technology that R&Ds are fond of releasing these days. Then again why lasers. Because you only need to point it in a right direction, and boom, the problem is solved. 

Death would be meaningless More or less. The memory and pain would remain, but after the tenth, twentieth time, I'd imagine it wouldn't be that bad. You'd get used to it. And with death lasting a matter of hours, the fear of it would diminish rapidly. With death being so meaningless I wouldn't imagine it would be such a huge crime as it is today: at most, you're wasting someone's day (killing someone in a particularly painful way must remain a crime, however. We wouldn't want sadists running free). Griefing would become a major annoyance. We've all seen that one guy who waits for you to spawn before killing you immediately in every online game ever. The second of pure annoyance when you wake up and spot your neighbour beside your bed, shotgun in hand, would be enough to cause people to do it. You'll remember, and you'll wake up annoyed as hell, but in truth, in this new society, it's not much more than camping in a video game. In the same vein, pranks among children (and some adults, most likely) would become popular. Setting up death traps to kill your friends would be hilarious once the fear of death has faded. As always, with pranks come bullies who take things too far. The bully would set up similar pranks, except his (or hers) would be painful. In our society, we steal our friend's phone as a joke but the bully would smash it. In this new society, we would jump out from behind a corner with a pistol, where the bully would jump out with a blunt knife. Games would have much larger stakes. Who needs paintball guns when we can just use rifles? And computer games would vanish. Wanna play GTA? Let's go rob a car, it will be back in the morning and would we be really inconveniencing anyone that badly by taking their car, when it will be there when they wake up anyway? Assassin's Creed? Forget it, let's just go assassinate the grocer. But that's short term. Long term, huge arenas would be constructed, video games made real, with spectators and bets. Who remembers that old TV show, Raven? Y'know the obstacle course where if you get hit you sorta fade out of being, and appear beside the course, unharmed? That show would be a lot more fun when if you mess up, you die. I mean, who cares, you'll be fine come the morning. 

I think “most powerful” is too vague a term. If divine magic is the most powerful in everything, I see no other way than reducing the users, as @Rekesoft already suggested. But looking at the real world we observe members of various cults don’t take kindly to your following any cult but theirs. I therefore propose a number of rivalising gods, each forbidding or discouraging the worship of others and granting powers in specific fields only. Any of these cults will have to ally to secular powers and secular magicians for access to a broader spectrum of magic. Assuming secular magic has a broader field of application. This kind of factionalism can help you build a complex and interesting web of interaction, perhaps with a twist due to an unexpected alliance? 

Simple drugs, such as Ibuprofen. Cheap presbyopia glasses. They are sold on the street for a couple of Euros in several Balkan countries and though not fitting the person exactly, would still be invaluable to them. It would be very hard to remake them, even if you get a pair. No need to fear causing a technical revolution (which rules out clocks, the dissembling of which would probably cause a lot of innovation). They were invented some time before 1286, but still very expensive. EDIT: There is this painting by Conrad von Soest, from AD 1403 showing the use of spectacles. So the best method would probably be to just give them the lenses - which were the veeery expensive part - and let them fashion a contemporary frame. Alternatively, you could gift them monocles with metal frames. 

They made humans magical, but none knows details Humans were an unmagical species in a world full of residual magic, left over perhaps by the elves... These creatures transform magic into biological existence, releasing a tiny fraction of magically saturated air. Upon inhaling that, humans slowly develop magical abilities. Nobody knows this, but it has been observed that the presence of the Grindlequark (or whatever it is called) greatly benefits spell casters. It is even rumoured that total isolation from grindlequarks for one year and one day renders one unmagical. This is all the more true of magically imbued artefacts, which abound in the library. Unfortunately for some dark wizards, the practice of preparing Tumbleweed-Grindlequark stew has not enhanced magical power in any palpable manner. But many still cherish it for its reputation and thick, savoury quality. Therefore the library not only doesn't dream of exterminating the Grindlequark, but novices are actually assigned to individual Grindlequarks, vouching for their safety and beckoning to their every whim. The creatures have proved remarkably adept in discrediting novices who don't guess the wishes they communicate through guestures and grimacing... If there is a competing race, eager to render humans unmagical again, they might even kill Grindlequarks in the wild, so the keeping of sanctuaries would be all the more important. 

My answer for this question is to use magic... specifically time magic This creature can be starve with right application of time magic. I doubt it would survive in a time capsule that has its time bubble accelerated to million years per second... It is a living creature thus it needs sustenance... the passage of time is your friend in this case 

Law of equivalent exchange - You can't create more than what you have given. (Can be bypassed by Philosophers Stone) Law of Preservation - You can't create anything out of nothingness. Law of Noise - The more magicians are in the vicinity the harder it is to cast magic and its tendency to fail increases as well.(Can be bypassed if one recieved the God of Silence's blessing or massive rituals) Law of Provision - Perversion of natures creation otherwise sentient will be reverted back to its original state or at the very least whats left of it in consideration of the first law. Law of world - The world will always reject perversion of its reality. Law of Time - No one can go to the future or past, offender will face the wrath of the gods and the world. 

The problem After 4 years being a baron, the empire that you are sharing a border with decides to declare war to your suzerain. It will take at least a year for them to muster their whole army and knock on the doors. You, the Baron has one year to prepare for war. The rest of the country refuses to help you due to the elitism of country's nobility. The royal family can't help you without showing favoritism and tells you that this is a trial on how well you handle the situation. Furthermore, the nobility have decided to protect the second line of defense instead of your barony. The nobility sees you as a social climber who knows nothing and they prefer to leave you to the enemy. They see this as an occasion where you can prove yourself (how useful you can be). They will barely supply you with anything but trading activities remain open. Your task is to delay the enemy at all cost since the country has little knowledge of war logistic. but no one said you cant stop them. The adversary, the empire, is a regional dominant power that can muster more than a million professional soldiers of its own, 4 million levies and another 2 million mixed of professional and levy soldiers from its vast vassal states. Economy wise, they can maintain a standing army indefinitely. They also deploy land battleships with no gunpowder but with numerous ballistas and formidable magicians that serves as the battleship's main weapon. The empire is not festered by corruption and uses divide and conquer tactics to subjugate adversaries. The Solution If mana containment fails can be very disastrous or in this case very beneficial for your cause, with the power to vaporize anything within 600 meters radius. This is the medieval-magical version of nuclear bomb, one or two of these can bring serious political discussions on the table when this thing hits the capital of the enemy. The Issue You know how to magically guide these bombs (magic remote control car) to their target. But that is too slow, you need something that will deliver this nukes to their targets in a timely fashion. Now comes these 2 solutions.
