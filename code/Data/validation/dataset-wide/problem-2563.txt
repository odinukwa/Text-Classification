Important question indeed! But not a simple thing to explain. Indeed, for the Buddha himself said that karma and reincarnation are one of the four things that can never be explained fully and to probe too deep into it will cause insanity! There are a ton of stories throughout all the Nikayas. I reccommend the book "Mind Experiment" by Bavo Lievens. You will see the glorious, intricate web of reincarnation across the planes of existence in vivid, holistic detail and see the things yourself by opening your Third Eye and most importantly the ladder to Buddhahood. As for your question, I assume you are looking for some formulaic method to figure out someone's future or past based on their present deeds and situation. Main principle: the present circumstance will help build up the OPPOSITE of whatever the person had too much of (e.g. if they forcibly repressed themselves from sex, they will go crazy with sex next life, if they be hatin'... they will be born in situations where the opposite of that can arise). Why is this the principle? Because one's incarnation is an educational program. Anyway, read the book. Here's the excerpt you wanted: 

Try meditating outside sometimes if you can, making sure you are safe and secure. That's how the forest monks did it back in the day of Buddha-lectures-at-full-moon. The most important "technique" is just being aware (vipassana). Be aware of everything recursively as it occurs including any scattering of awareness itself. Eventually everything will calm down and you will be quite alright and cool. Also, take a cool shower and eat less (Buddhists do not eat past noon meal, thus reducing our sexual desires, creating a detox state, and many many positive effects including heat reduction). 

Recently I got into a long debate with some people on Reddit about killing pestilent, poisonous insects. Feel free to read it. There are some interesting scientific findings. Whatever the word is for people who go over-board with their compassion/ahimsa trip... I think they are doing that, considering it was a poisonous spider (about to give birth to 100 more) I dispatched. So what does Buddhism say about intentionally killing dangerous (poisonous) and/or pestilent insects? Specifically dangerous insects in one's personal and community environment. Surely, the suttas, aimed towards forest-dwellers, must have some guidelines on harmful insects and animals. 

Why? Different time period. Namarupa is more Theravadin and Five Skandha is a much precise, evolved system that isn't really deeply spoken of until Surangama Sutra--a Mahayana invention. And are they identical ways of saying the same thing? No. Not identical but very close. From Wikipedia entry: 

Any time that you actually will do it is the best time! Enough said. ...Here's a list of conditions that make my meditation effortlessly take off into concentration/wisdom: 

Yes, no explanation of thought is complete without dependency on some other phenomena. Everything is interdependent, nothing is itself without anything else. (But not necessarily "transparent".) No! Consciousness is the 5th aggregate/skandha. It is at an even more root level than thought itself! (which is the 3rd aggregate/skandha) You can perceive consciousness (without thought) through the usage of prajna wisdom. There is also a jhana that is pure consciousness, no thought (one of the four formless skandhas). 

Usually a Buddhist isn't completely only a Theravadin and does use mantrayana methods to generate merit and ask for assistance from various deities which exist only to serve. There is no one to turn to in Theravada though (and in actuality) because there isn't really anyone that can absolve "our own" karma, Buddha or deity--otherwise the all-compassionate Buddhas would have already made things perfect for us. Nonetheless, there is a solution to removing the suffering. First of all recognizing the disadvantage and unskillfulness of experiencing sorrow or holding onto whatever emotion that is disadvantageous and generating a clear mind (that can actually accomplish one's goal). This is done through a gradualistic means, starting with reasoning and gentle methods and if that doesn't work bashing and destroying the unskillful thoughts and emotions. Look into their interdependent origination, come to full acceptance of it ("reality is reality whether you accept it or not") and then letting it go and exercising upekkha. This does not mean indifference. After coming to terms with the reality, one can become even more flexible, clear-minded, aware of the reality and able to create a better reality. There is no magical process and the Buddhist psychology only facilitates the natural psychology of DABDA. The Four Noble Truths contains all these lessons of course and more. 

Be intelligent in your affirmation design and do not make them unrealistic. Conclusively, understanding Buddhism in relation to purpose and life's priorities is the best fix-all though (i.e. motivation) and I would recommend the free book "Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha" to get a good modern understanding of this. 

The above is from William Bodri's book again same chapter about clarity in dreams due to breaking the conception skandha. Please see Tao & Longevity by Master Huai-Chin Nan if you want to understand the energetic connection. Master Nan himself was a Taoist Buddhist Esoteric and Zen Buddhist master and he said that for our generation of analytical people, no less is sufficient for our information-addicted minds to be cautious and self-aware along the path.. From these passages, I hope people can be alerted to the importance of dream awareness. In Tibetan Buddhist books, it is also exclaimed that if you cultivate within your dreams, your power of cultivation is tenfold! This is a loud fact that was emphasized very much whenever I managed to succeed in meditating during my lucid dreams (3 times I can clearly remember over the past years but probably more I cannot). Each time, I felt fundamentally transformed, mainly because I made it so (long explanation). People that master the ability to be clear in their dreams, thus should not waste such opportunities. And people that are not yet aware, should train themselves to be so! Lucid dreams are emotionally healing and having them is not only a means of cultivation but a sign of proper cultivation as the book I excerpted indicates and Buddha's Surangama Sutra also indicates! I highly reccommend the book I excerpted, you will find ample answers to satisfy your questions about the Tao, cultivation, dreaming, and how it all still falls under/works with Buddhism. So what techniques do I reccommend to achieve lucid dreams (LD)? Honestly, I'm still conflicted between causing them through cultivation. Nonetheless, LDs positive effects are undisputed (in the scientific community at large now as well)[google it]. It's easy to be practicing awareness meditation like a dog and then fall asleep like a dog, waking up not even remember a dream. It takes finesse, gentleness... and outcome detachment to succeed. Out of the many techniques I'm going to end my post here with I would reccommend the WILD technique. I would also reccommend combining all the other techniques but not too many. I have taken them from many different traditions and these are the best out of the many I have experimented with in the past 10-15 years. 

Even at "ultimate-level", it is mostly true because as the Diamond Sutra states, the person who is Enlightened, does not know of a person who is Enlightened. There is no ego, individuality, or a person, furthermore as the Heart Sutra says, there is no suffering, no cause of suffering, no knowledge, nothing. These were all illusions piled on top of illusions for the sake of leaving illusion.. 

I'm 26 and I considered myself becoming Buddhist when I was 14. I come from a very loyal Islamic family and I totally think that Islam is a beneficial religion... containing within it the simplest and easiest spiritual practices of all Abrahamic religions because it has a meditation+yoga-like prayer system, calling all practitioners to Practice with single-mindedness towards a singular God every day five times a day (namaj). I made a lot of mistakes over the years in expressing these ideas with simultaneous conviction and non-defensiveness that is my power now. Islam is a very strict religion on the the level of the 1st two trainings: 

Yuttadhammo is correct. It is better to bias yourself towards noticing the ultimate same-ness (anicca, anatta, dukkha) of the particular experience rather than to get involved in being attracted or repelled by the content (specific taste, specific type of imagination) by investigating it and analyzing it. Treat all experiences as ultimately the same and detach yourself from feeding them energy. I highly reccommend the instructions on page 14 of this meditation manual. It is the best, most amazing, integrative gem of a manual on vipassana and one should read the whole thing. Here's the excerpt relevant to the fine, content-free nature of vipassana practice: 

Yes they can. If one does good, particular "higher" beings (including Buddhas) can more easily help that being (they are attracted to the good karma). If one does evil, asuras can more easily haunt that being (they are attracted to the evil karma). There are many other properties to them that are completely irrelevant to the Buddhist project (see Noble Truths) and the importance of meditation and attainment within our extremely fortuitous but also extremely brief life-time... But to answer your last question... yes it is compatible but also remember that Hindus also believe in this stuff. The difference with Buddhism from all (inferior) traditions is there exists Buddhahood for the sake of all beings and the Three Trainings and this has little to do with over-concern for worldly matters (e.g. Mythbusters and other obsessions with paranormal phenomena). The Buddha himself said this and so did Confucius (who had Enlightenment). To satisfy your curiousity though, devas are mentioned throughout the scriptures and the Buddha mentions his experiences with them in vivid detail. The following is a taste of the first half of "The Mind Experiment" with excerpts from respective suttas: 

The 3rd training is hard to do without proper advancement in 2nd training. The 2nd training is hard to do without proper advancement in the 1st training. The 1st training you must do or else you will sink into a lower form of existence in the next life. Rmemember that the above method may seem like a lot in words but it's main success is in the lifestyle path you choose (animal-killers or prostitutes are not Right Livelihood and will experience more poisons than others always) and being mindful in the moment (#2 and #3), transforming the emotion. This can be a matter of a split second. I have not referenced any lengthy suttas in this text but these are all true things said by the Buddha. I would recommend seeing the chapter on the Three Trainings within the free book Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha for more info and read the entire book. Super big secrets.
