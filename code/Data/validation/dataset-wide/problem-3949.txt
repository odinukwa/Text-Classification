Thanks for the reply, but there are two problems with this (which is not your fault, I should have been clearer). Firstly, I am working with modules over an algebraic group, for which there are not necessarily enough projectives. And yes, I had tried to make the above argument work for injective resolutions (of which there are enough), but have run into some issues. Do you see a way to make your argument work using an injective resolution? The second problem (and I didn't make this clear) is that I was really hoping to take the chain of linkages to be between extensions comprised of only finite dimensional modules, and I don't see that an algebraic group has enough finite dimensional injectives. If I could find a length-$2$ linkage between an infinite dimensional extension comprised of injectives, that would be worth something to me, but to be able to take them to be finite dimensional would be much better. Of course, this raises a question that I hadn't even considered: given that $\xi$ and $\nu$ are equivalent, does there even necessarily exist a chain of linkages from $\xi$ to $\nu$ using extensions comprised of only finite dimensional modules, let alone one of bounded length? 

In my dissertation I proved a certain theorem(s) concerning the representation theory of a direct product G x H of algebraic groups over a field, given those of G and H. But I would wager 100:1 that this theorem is well known, and as such I am looking for a primary reference for it. I have combed (my personal) literature for it, e.g. Jantzen, Humphreys, etc., but cannot find it. The theorem(s) can be found in section 2 of the following pdf file: $URL$ Please ignore the other sections of the file as they pertain to questions having little relevance here. Thanks in advance for any help. $\underline{\text{Question, version 2.0}}$ Sorry again for the confusion, my notation appears to have been sloppy. And sorry that I haven't posted the entire thing on this page, but I really think it's more efficient (for everyone) that I post it here: $URL$ This theorem I believe is much more basic than the gracious people who bothered to try to answer it (in my garbled terminology) have made it out to be. I am talking about arbitrary representations (not irreducible, etc.) over arbitrary fields (not algebraically closed, etc.) for arbitrary algebraic groups (not reductive, etc.). It is simply the statement that any $G \times H$-module structure on a $k$-vector space $V$ can be factored (as a product of matrices, or linear maps if you like) uniquely into a product of commuting representations for $G$ and $H$ on that same vector space. In section 2 there are no tensor products or direct sums of vector spaces taking place; the vector space $V$ is fixed throughout, and all three of the groups $G$, $H$, and $G \times H$ are acting on it. The corollaries that follow in section 3 merely re-affirm the suspicion that, for fixed $G \times H$-representations on the fixed vector spaces $V$ and $W$, things like "tensor product", "direct sum", and "morphism" of $G \times H$-modules should behave as expected with respect to their respective $G$ and $H$ modules. Thank you once again for any help. 

1) What is the proper term for a closed subgroup H of an algebraic group G such that every linear representation of H arises as the restriction of a representation of G? 2) Where can I read about this? 

I have a conjecture concerning how "tightly" two equivalent $n$-fold extensions of modules over an algebraic group over a field might be "linked". I suspect that the question has been already studied in at least some depth, and a positive or negative answer (or partial positive or negative answer) would either way be greatly helpful. Background. Let $G$ be an algebraic group over a field $k$. Let $M$ and $N$ be finite dimensional (as $k$-vector spaces) $G$-modules (that is, representations of $G$ over $k$), and let $\xi:0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow X_{n-1} \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow X_0 \rightarrow M \rightarrow 0$ $\nu: 0 \rightarrow N \rightarrow Y_{n-1} \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow Y_0 \rightarrow M \rightarrow 0$ be two $n$-fold extension of $M$ by $N$, where all of the $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are also finite dimensional. Call the extensions $\xi$ and $\nu$ "linked" if there is a "linkage" between them, that is, a commutative diagram \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc} \xi: 0 &\to & N & \to & X_{n-1} & \to & \ldots & \to & X_0 & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \newline & & \wr\downarrow & & \downarrow & & & & \downarrow & & \wr\downarrow \\ \newline \nu: 0 &\to & N & \to & Y_{n-1} & \to & \ldots & \to & Y_0 & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \end{array} Call $\xi$ and $\nu$ "equivalent" if they are equivalent with respect to the equivalence relation generated by "linked", that is, if there is a finite chain of linkages leading from $\xi$ to $\nu$. (For those of you more accustomed to other ways of thinking of the $\text{Ext}$ functor, this is the same as saying that $\xi = \nu$ as elements of $\text{Ext}^n_{G(k)}(M,N)$.) The conjecture: There is a positive integer $m$ (perhaps depending on $G$, $k$, $n$, $M$ and $N$, but not on the particular extensions $\xi$ and $\nu$) such that, if $\xi$ and $\nu$ are equivalent, then they are linked via a linkage of length no greater than $m$. Remarks. To illustrate what is going on here, consider three $n$-fold extensions $\xi, \tau$ and $\nu$ of $M$ by $N$, and suppose we have a commutative diagram \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc} \xi: 0 &\to & N & \to & X_{n-1} & \to & \ldots & \to & X_0 & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \newline & & \wr\downarrow & & \downarrow & & & & \downarrow & & \wr\downarrow \\ \newline \tau: 0 &\to & N & \to & Z_{n-1} & \to & \ldots & \to & Z_0 & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \newline & & \wr\uparrow & & \uparrow & & & & \uparrow & & \wr\uparrow \\ \newline \nu: 0 &\to & N & \to & Y_{n-1} & \to & \ldots & \to & Y_0 & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \newline \end{array} Then $\xi$ and $\nu$ are equivalent, since there is a length-$2$ chain of linkages between them, namely $\xi \rightarrow \tau \leftarrow \nu$. But it is by no means guaranteed that there is an ACTUAL linkage between $\xi$ and $\nu$, that is, a commutative diagram \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc} \xi: 0 &\to & N & \to & X_{n-1} & \to & \ldots & \to & X_0 & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \newline & & \wr\downarrow & & \downarrow & & & & \downarrow & & \wr\downarrow \\ \newline \nu: 0 &\to & N & \to & Y_{n-1} & \to & \ldots & \to & Y_0 & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \newline \end{array} The conjecture asks: suppose that all you know is that there is some finite chain of linkages leading from $\xi$ to $\nu$, of perhaps very huge length. Does there then also exist a chain of linkages leading from $\xi$ to $\nu$ of length no greater than $m$? (again, $m$ perhaps depending on the group, the field, the length $n$ of the extensions, and the modules $M$ and $N$, but not on the particular extensions $\xi$ and $\nu$ [this would be utterly trivial of course]). Note that this conjecture is trivially true for the case $n=1$. This is because a linkage between $1$-fold extensions \begin{array}{cccccccccccccc} \xi: 0 &\to & N & \to & X_{0} & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \newline & & \wr\downarrow & & \wr\downarrow & & \wr\downarrow \\ \newline \nu: 0 &\to & N & \to & Y_{0} & \to & M & \to & 0 \\ \end{array} is necessarily an isomorphism of exact sequences (that is, the second map of the linkage is also invertible). Thus you can take any finite length chain of linkages, compose them, and you have a single linkage. Thus, for $n = 1$, no matter $G$, $k$, $M$ or $N$, you can take in all cases $m=1$. I also suspect that the conjecture is true for some further rather trivial examples. For example, let $G = G_0$, where $G_0$ is the trivial algebraic group over $k$ (that is, when $G$-modules are nothing more than vector spaces over $k$, and morphisms between them are nothing more than $k$-linear maps), let $n=2$, and let $M$ and $N$ both be the vector space $k$. Consider then the following $2$-fold extension of $k$ by $k$: \begin{array}{cccccccccccc} \xi: 0 &\to & k & \to & k^{100} & \to & k^{99} & \to & k & \to & 0 \\ \end{array} It can be shown straightforwardly that this extension is equivalent, via a single linkage, to \begin{array}{cccccccccccc} \tau: 0 &\to & k & \to & k^2 & \to & k & \to & k & \to & 0 \\ \end{array} But so also can $\nu$ be linked to $\tau$, where $\nu$ is the extension \begin{array}{cccccccccccc} \nu: 0 &\to & k & \to & k^{200} & \to & k^{199} & \to & k & \to & 0 \\ \end{array} Since all extensions of $k$ by $k$ essentially looks like this, this seems to say that, for $G = G_0$, $n=2$, and $M = N = k$, we can always take $m=2$. The truth or falsity of these results have real implications towards my current research, and being much less than an expert in cohomology, they have been torturing me for some time. I have no idea whether this result is in general true, nor under what conditions it may be true. Any partial answers (such as "if $G$ is this, $k$ is that, $n$ is this, and if $M$ and $N$ are this and that, then the conjecture is true/false") are very much welcome. For reasons I won't go into, a sharp estimate of such a chain length bound $m$ is by no means required for my purposes; all I need to know is whether or not such an $m$ exists. Thanks so much for any advice or help. 

It is well known that any unipotent algebraic group (over a field) can be embedded as a closed subgroup of $U_n$ for some $n$, where $U_n$ denotes the set of all $n \times n$ upper triangular matrices with $1$'s on the diagonal. An algebraic subgroup $H$ of an algebraic group $G$ is called $\textbf{observable}$ if every (rational) linear representation of $H$ arises as the restriction of a (rational) linear representation of $G$. My question: Under what conditions, if any, is a unipotent algebraic group observable with respect to its overgroup $U_n$? Background: I have in hand a certain result concerning the characteristic $p>0$ representation theory of the groups $U_n$, when $p$ is sufficiently large when compared to $n$ and the dimension of a representation. It essentially says that such representation look functorially identical to representations of $U_n^\infty$ (countable direct product of copies of $U_n$) in characteristic zero. If I can pass representations of a unipotent algebraic group $U$ to representations of its overgroup $U_n$, then I get the theorem for free for $U$. Of course, I have no reason to believe when and if this is true, it’s just a shot in the dark that gives me a wonderful shortcut. Ideas? 

I'm no expert in this area, but I do have some background in mathematical logic, so I'll give it a shot. Indeed, a vast amount of work has been done in this area over the last century (e.g. Godel, Tarski). Your first look should be towards model theory; Wilfred Hodges' "A shorter model theory" is a great place to start and should keep you busy for quite some time. You'll learn about relational structures (a very general type of mathematical structure via which all of the objects you mentioned can be realized), the "first-order languages" associated to these structures, and all of the true, "first-order" statements that you can make about them, using the basic underlying relations and functions on your objects as the primitive elements of your language. You need to be careful however about what you mean by the "set of all true statements you can make about ...". One must always have in mind a well defined language with which you are allowed to make statements and formulas, and the most commonly studied is first-order languages. I'll leave it to Hodges to explain the particulars, but the defining feature of first-order is, you are only allowed to quantify over elements of your structure, not subsets. For example, the following is a first-order statement in the (typical) language of fields, let's say about the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$: "(for all elements x and y of $\mathbb{R}$)( x*y = y*x)" which is obviously asserting that multiplication in $\mathbb{R}$ is commutative. However, the following is not first-order: "(for all subsets $S$ of $\mathbb{R}$)(if $S$ is bounded from above, then it has a least upper bound)" which is asserting the completeness property of $\mathbb{R}$. It can be shown in fact, no matter how clever you are, you can't express the completeness property of the reals in a first-order way. Despite its inherent limitations, there are very good reasons for restricting yourself to first-order languages, whenever possible. Firstly, it is a wonderfully expressive language, and there are in fact a good many interesting mathematical statements one can make with it. But secondly, and more importantly, first-order logic satisfies some extremely useful regularity conditions, ones that higher order languages (e.g. those that allow quantification over subsets) do not, and is in some sense the most robust language that satisfies these conditions. Principal among them are the so-called compactness theorem for first-order logic, and Godel's completeness (not incompleteness!) theorem. But anyway, check out Hodges' book. He's an extremely readable and enlightening author, especially for a logician.
