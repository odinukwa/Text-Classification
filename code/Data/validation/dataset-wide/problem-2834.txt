I am a little bit puzzled, because you assume that Mill's liberty principle can encourage paternalistic intervention. However, Mill's liberty principle, as you quote, denies any kind of of intervention except to prevent harm dont to others. Instances of paternalistic intervention would be, for example, the ban on drugs, because they are not good for yourself. The last sentence, i.e. "His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.", states that taking drugs without harming other people is fine. The quoted SEP article seems to confuse his two consequentialist arguments against paternalistic intervention and his liberty principle. His two arguments according to SEP are "First, state power is liable to abuse" and "Second, even well intentioned rulers will misidentify the good of citizens". But as I pointed out above, his liberty principle explicitly rules out any paternalistic intervention, good or bad, working or not working. Also, it seems that Mill is after something like the following. Given that an institution has so much power to intervene with the people, even if they never abuse it, they could, and that is sufficient not to have such an institution. The possibility of abuse weighs more than the 'good' that could be done.

Some time ago, people thought that numbers are really sets. For example, 0 is the null set, 1 is the set of the null set, 2 is the set of the set of the null set, and so on. But this way of identifying numbers with sets is just one way to do it. Here is another. 0 is the null set, 1 is the powerset of 0, 2 is the powerset of 1, and so on. (which gives us the following sequence: {}; {{}}; {{}, {{}}};... (This is a very short and probably bad summary of Benacerrafs 'What Numbers Could Not Be' (1965)) This insight motivates the Structuralist's position, that any sequence of stuff will do. 

'Therefore' is the indicator for the conclusion of an argument. What follows is a proof that should hopefully answer your question.

In sentence 1 it is clear about which day and which time we are speaking. It is also clear who is standing and where he stands. In sentence 2 the meaning (and truth) depends upon various things: The speaker, since "I" refers to whoever utters the sentence. The date, because "Yesterday" refers to the day before today. In some cases it might be true, but in some cases it will probably be wrong (except for the case of the utterer standing there everyday). Terms like "Yesterday", "I", "there", "here" etc. are called indexical, because they can refer to different things. 

I share your inability concerning the technical tools and I am far from understand much of it, but I have heared some sidenotes on this in lectures I visited. Set theory got axioms (at least one kind of set theory, and I think the one in question). From these axioms CH cannot be proved and cannot be disproved. That means, that CH is independent of the axioms of set theory. 

It may not be an answer to your question, but to those things you wrote before asking your question. It seems to me that your starting point, that the pre-socratics stopped relying on mythical and supernatural explanations, is utterly wrong. Meet Parmenides, who wrote a poem: 

Introduction Personal Identity Fatalism Time God Why Not Nothing? Free Will and Determinism Constitution Universals Possibility and Necessity What is Metaphysics 

As I see no real way to answer this directly, I just post something that is related. In his original position John Rawls proposes that envy is no feature of the parties and comes to the conclusion that they would pick his two principles, that allow inequalities only if the least-well-off benefit from it. So Rawls thinks that principles of equality are picked even when, or because, envy is excluded in the reasoning. 

These links will provide the information you are looking for: SEP on Aesthetic Concepts, and on Aesthetic Judgement. Furthermore, here are some nice articles: 

One position in the philosophy of maths is Structuralism (as has been pointed out in the comments). According to Structuralism, mathematics is not about numbers, sets, functions, etc., but about structures. It identifies common mathematical objects with places and relations in structures. 

You are, in a sense, begging the question against (a part of) those who ask themselves the question whether mathematical objects really exist. That is, because you already come equipped with a certain theory of what mathematical objects are. According to you, mathematical objects are ideas, concepts and equations. A big part of the discussion about the existence of mathematical objects concerns the question what mathematical objects could be. Can we have mathematics as we practice it today if mathematical objects are concrete? Can we have knowledge of mathematics when mathematical objects are abstract? If so, how? I suggest that you read the related SEP entry on the philosophy of mathematics. 

In a libertarian society there is no government that is building roads. Lets suppose there is a minimal state, consisting of some kind of court-system and a police. Then libertarians would agree that its ok to pay taxes for maintaining that government. They just don't like the taxes our governments impose upon us. 

(5) is a theorem. It says that (A-->B) implies (¬B --> ¬A). To get back to your question, you can write the following true statement: 

But what are these structures? According to some, they are abstract objects in their own right. Here we have the problem of supplying a satisfying epistemology of abstracta. According to others, they are concrete. Here we have the problem that mathematics is thought to be non-contingent, while what is concrete, and how much concrete stuff there is, is contingent. And according to a third position, they are merely logically possible, which again dodges some problems and runs into others (do we know that there are possible structures? etc) 

One question was whether the participants believed in scientific realism or anti-realism. The answer was: 

Your question can be answered by looking at the a posteriori/a priori distinction. We can think of the a priori realm as what can be known without relying on senses. And the really important part here is the 'can'. I didn't show that maths is after all a posteriori, because I got all my knowledge from staring at blackboards. The fact that I could in principle reach all my mathematical knowledge without ever relying on a sense is what makes math a priori. Another way to look at it is via the distinction of genesis vs. justification. You got your mathematical beliefs from your senses, but you dont justify them with your sense-experience. When I ask you what justifies your belief that 2+2=4, you don't refer to your math teacher, but to numbers, and how they work. And that are things you've arguably never experienced. 

Yes it is possible to know things with absolute certainty, however, it is also possible for someone else to claim to know the negation of it with absolute certainty. Some examples, commonly referred to as necessary truths: All things are selfidentical. There is no thing such that it is a circle and it is squared. There is no thing such that is is a horse and not a horse. 1+1=2 

Just to name a few. Also Plato relies upon supernatural and mythical explanations, just read his metaphor of the sun, or his platonic number, which is mythical indeed. I don't want to laugh about them, or make them any smaller than they are, but besides being awesome and working out the foundations on which we all stand, they were mythical, religious and believed in supernatural stuffs. 

I take 'Justice as Fairness' to be the name of Rawls' political theory on how we should basically live together. As SEP states in an article on Rawls, his 

Whether or not teaching mathematics to children helps to spread the idea of equality is an empirical, psychological, maybe educational question. It is not a question of philosophy. That said, why should mathematics help with equality? There will be a whole bunch of counterexamples, crazy murderer that are genius at math, early civilizations (most notably ancient greece) that thought a lot about math while celebrating slavery. And then, as Rex Kerr pointed out, humans are, according to all our sciences, not identical. Therefore invoking the "=" seems to be out of place. As to your question, I don't know about any philosopher who thought about this, but maybe you will find someone in gendertheory/sociology who writes about this. 

For all x, there exists a y (If x is F, then x > y) For all x (If x is F, then there exists a y (x > y)) 

In the literature about the epistemology of modality I stumbled upon various types of possibilities, e.g. epistemic possibility, metaphysical possibility. I have a rough unterstanding of these, but would like to know what it is exactly for something to be a metaphysical possibility. 

A great book on terminology would be Papineaus "Philosophical Devices: Proofs, Probabilities, Possibilities, And Sets". It introduces almost everything to get started with philosophy,e.g. the mathematical apparatus, logics, the important distinctions: type/token, use/mention, a priori/a posteriori, analytic/synthetic, necessary/contingent/possible and so on. You won´t find anything on logical positivism in it, though (i think). 

Just a little sidenote... I thought that since Kant believed Euclidean geometry to be synthetic a priori and true, and since space is infact bent and non-euclidean (same with Newtonian mechanics, thought to be synthetic a priori, but along came Einstein), that may refute synthetic a priori as an impossibility. 

I add to Ingos answer that you can at least kick some ethics out. Sidgwick in his third book, chapter 11.2, proposes a test for moral intuitions. Every intuition that passes the test is true. There are 4 steps: 

I don't think that positivism is a position of mostly leftist philosophers. According to this article, the positivism dispute was between the critical rationalists and the Frankfurt school. I don't want to say that the critical rationalists are politically right, but I can say for sure that the Frankfurt school is left: 

I personally enjoyed Theodore Sider's and Earl Conee's 'Riddles of Existence: A Guided Tour of Metaphysics'. Here is the table of contents: 

It seems to me that the other answers are terribly wrong. 1.They state that philosophy is no use, because you cannot build cars with it. 2.They state that there is no great philosopher nowadays. 3.They state that philosophy is a game for rich kids which the common man does not understand. Reply to 1: It is probably not even true that there would be cars without philosophy. Because science emerged out of philosophy and still needs it. To take another example: Without the work of Gottlob Frege we could not have built computers, for without his work computer-science is impossible. And lastly, washing machines make use of fuzzy logic, which again is a branch of philosophy. Also, look at the declaration of human rights, the declaration of independence; all those stuff is heavily influenced by philosophy/philosophers. And yet again, philosophy can, or is, an end in itself. For whatever reason, it interests people to engage in philosophical thoughts. After all, why go to work if life has no sense? And just one more, which I just copy from another answer to another question. You need philosophy, to argue that philosophy is crap. Reply to 2: I think there are great philosophers nowadays. I could just type down a list, but I'm not sure what criteria a great philosopher needs to satisfy. Surely, those engaged in political philosophy have a great impact on the debated of today and tommorow. Peter Singer has converted a lot of people into vegetarians. Karl Popper has shaped the methods of politics and the sciences. Reply to 3: I think the first bit of the answer is just stupid. Look at the faculties. No rich kids there. They study law and/or business. However, the second bit, for me, is on the right track. (Real) academic philosophy is hard. Philosophy in the schools is too weak. They don't learn the needed vocabulary. They don't learn the needed tools. They don't learn logic. Now, if a professor of philosophy were to write an article in a newspaper about his new work, it is impossible for him to do so, because noone will understand it. The common man did not learn to do/to read philosophy in schools, he just talked a bit about platos cave and that freedom is quite a cool thing maybe. To answer your question directly: The common man, whoever that is, views philosophy as unnecessary, because he never learned to understand it. He misses the necessary tools, the necessary background, to understand arguments, which are central to philosophy. 

So my question is: Do we find the necessities of the world by looking at the possible worlds, or are we first fixing what is necessary, and what is necessary then determines what possible worlds there are. I am especially looking for something that I can quote (books, articles in journals...). 

Where E stands for the existential quantifier. As I understand the quote, in order to be a fictional charakter x, one has to exemplify some property according to s, where s is a story. 

Maybe I'm not fully understanding you, but it could be that you are looking for the notion of ground. Grounding is understood as a relation between various things (depending on your view). For example: (A & B) might be grounded in A, B. And A v B might be grounded in either disjunct and on another view, the chair is grounded in its consitutuents. Grounding as understood by Kit Fine for example deals with metaphysical necessities and also requires that what is grounded is explained by its grounds (I find the phrase "ontological dependence" very helpful to understand ground aswell). As for essence, one way to deal with it would be to say that it is Y's essence to be grounded in X. After reading your question again, this answers the first part: "I am looking for reflections related to relationships between things..." but not the "everything is interrelated"-bit. 

Occam's razor is a principle to choose between two theories which have the same explanatory power. According to the razor, you ought to choose the one that postulates lesser entities. This explanation, while often helpful, is still rather unclear and the details are still debated among philosophers. For example, it is left open whether a theory with less types of entities or with less tokens should be preferred (Examples for types: Numbers, Sets, Functions..., and for tokens: 1, 2, {{45}}...). To conclude: You don't apply it correctly, because the principle is about theory choice. 

Inspired to post my answer after I read Moziburs: If whatever is essential is also necessary: No, electrons dont exist necessarily. There is a possible world consisting only of gunk, no electron is member of the world (see Ted Sider: Van Inwagen and the Possibility of Gunk). For more gunk, see SEP on Monism. Reading essential as fundamental, according to some: Yes, the electron has no proper parts and therefore is essential. (It might still be possible in the future to divide it into some other stuff, which makes that stuff fundamental) According to some others (e.g. Schaffer): No, the only fundamental thing is the world. 

Maybe think about it this way. B actually denies the inference, if there is any, from 'Peanut butter causes cancer' to 'you should avoid it'. Just because something causes cancer doesn't mean we should avoid it. Why? Well many things cause cancer, and it's not true of them that we should avoid them, so what makes peanut butter special? I'm not saying it can't be argued that there is something that makes peanut butter special (maybe it's special in that it is very easy to avoid, and pollution isn't), but maybe this is what the objector had in mind. If it is, I don't see a fallacy here. 

At least if you use the sharp philsophical meaning attached to deduction and induction, then deduction is more valid than induction. One major reason is that deduction can't go wrong, while induction can always go wrong. No matter how many white swans you've observed, the next one could always be a black one. On the other hand, if you start from 'all swans are white' and you find one black swan, you can deductively reason that your first statement is false. You can also see that the deductive sciences, logic and mathematics, are such that we are most certain of them, while the inductive sciences are less certain and often involve theories later being proven wrong. As to your analogy: Induction is the method by which we reason from instances to a general (as in: involving infinitely many instances) law. (You can also go from laws to a more general law). Deduction is the method to show what (deductively) follows from what.
