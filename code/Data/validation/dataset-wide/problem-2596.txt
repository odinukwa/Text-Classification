Morality is based on refraining from, delighting in, i.e., abstinence from any form any action which is harmful to oneself and others in terms of verbal action, physical conduct and may or earning your livelihood. Mastery over the mind is to get control over the mind than it being wondering on its own. This control can be used to get sustained focus on any experiance (sometimes called absorption) which is feld so you can understand it better by closer scrutiny and analysis, i.e., right concentration. In order to do this you need be aware of what these experiences, i.e., right mindfulness. In order to realise this you have to apply effort to have the right mind states to foster development of concentration. Ultimately this gives arise to the understanding on how the eradicate stress and suffering, i.e., Right View. With the propers understanding, your resolve is always conducive, i.e., Right Intention. Where this was Conceived This was formulated by the Buddha based on experience of his aesthetic practices and princely life before when he said realised it is futile to follow both paths.2 Final realisation coming under the Bodhi Tree in Bodh Gaya on the day of enlightenment, i.e., following the middle path worked hence if was confirmed through direct experience. 3 Where was this 1st Preached and What Elaboration are Available This was 1st preached in the Dhamma,cakka Pavattana Sutta as the middle way was preached in Sarnath. More detail elaboration of it is found in the (Magga) Vibhaṅga Sutta. Right view is one of the most important items as without it you will not take or walk the path. A detail elaboration of this is found in the: Samma,ditthi Sutta. 

To add to both @Unrul3r @Andrei Volkov's answers. You can break the links of Dependent Origination when you understand it at the experiential level. When enter the Attainment of Cessation you see the links in one direction (contact has ceased followed by ... ) and when coming out the other direction (contact has started followed by ... ). Depending on the clarity you achieve you enter one of the stages of sainthood. Understanding of Path Leading Out of Misery and Path of Misery starts at with contact followed by sensation at the experiential level. This becomes clear and the understanding becomes 1st hand when you enter the Attainment of Cessation. 

Psychedelic is an intoxicant leading to heedlessness hence not acceptable in Buddhism even for lay people. When it comes to monks who have a higher standers of Sila this is certainly not acceptable. I don't think monks would have used such substance at any point in history without breaking the Vinaya. This is well explained in "THE FIVE PRECEPTS" which is a very good read on the 5 precepts. 

When you do not achieve spiritual goals unsatisfactoriness may arise. [Sal,āyatana Vibhanga Sutta] Best is try to keep you mind and practice steady. Also see if you are putting too much effect leading to restless worry. Also do not measure progress too often. Just do what needs to be done, i.e., just practice! 

What is said here is to learn attentively, remember what is taught and understand the theory and practice. 

Deva,daha Sutta - it is best you read the whole sutta as it is about self-mortification and too long to quote in full during his 6 years of searching he practiced extreme ... With regard to other references about Buddha's path to enlightenment and also self mortification see: 

To compliment @Lee-Hebditch's answer I like to add the following. When you are emotional you loose the balance of your mind. So nor reacting does not mean shutting off from any contact with the out side world. When you make contact you will experience a sensation which you evaluate and react with craving or aversion. This reaction is what needs to stop. When this is the case you do not loose the balance of the mind. Then you can choose a better course of action to help your self and others. 

None of which are pleasant to have or worthwhile to have or keep around. What you gain is unshakable peace and happiness (free from Dukkha or Nirvana). In addition you end Jarāmaraṇa and the cycle of Dependent Origination. As per what you said in your text you are able to enjoy more which perhaps is due to reduction of the above undesirables. Once the are completely gone only happiness remain. This happiness is stable and not dependent on anything else and does not end. Therefore, you will be able to enjoy life like never before through not they type of enjoyment you have experienced before (ämisa sukha). This is a more higher type of enjoyment (niramisa sukha). 

You should not have an emphasis on which should develop fist but let it take its natural course. Both are important as wisdoms has concentration as the base and concentration has morality as the base. Like a roof over your head cannot exist without walls and a foundation. 

These address the root cause. Samantha techniques temporarily suppresses the hindrances which being clarity to continue into Vipassanā. So some of the techniques you mention are not the most suitable through if you practice the Brahmavihara and loathsome mediation in such a way that it develops Insight this also can be helpful. The more sure way is always 4 Satipatthana and Anapanasati practiced as Vipassana than to develop Samatha. As for a specific techniques is described below. In short what you have to do is concentrate on the feeling of sorrow and other experiences until you understand it. One of the shortest rendering of Insight meditation is as follows: 

So when doing metta meditation you should look into the contact of the through with your mind sense door. Mere wishing some one does not cause you misery in most cases. Hence there is no issue with this perception. Some times is you are giving metta to some on of the opposite sex who you consider beautiful then raga may arise. Sometimes if a loved one is in a bad situation then some negative feeling may arise with the craving to overcome the difficulty. Also when you bring up the perception of someone you hate to be well and happy. Keep looking at the contact of the thought with the mind and the sensation it produces. If the thoughts, perceptions and views on oneself is creating unpleasant (based on aversion) / pleasant (based on craving) sensations then you are not doing the meditation the right way. (Also note neutral sensation can be based on perceptions and views also hence based on ignorance of reality but if they are not causing any thing other than neutral sensation then at least it is a start.) If you strengthening the perceptions (sanna) and views (ditti) then you are doing the meditation the wrong way. If it is lightening the perceptions and views then you are doing it the correct way. Your thoughts of metta should ideally proliferate to either karuan and / or mudita and then finally upekka. Every though should end in equanimity and understanding of its impermanence. Equanimity since you have no absolute control and any expectation are unsatisfactory hence strengthening your understanding Anatta and Sakaya. Also this can be practice at three levels: 

Stress and sorrow generally co exists with unwholesome mind state. This can lead to hindrances arising. 

Generally if you are not progressing, you are not practicing insight as you are supposed to. If you listen to and follow the instruction properly then you will make progress. If not you are not practicing the wrong technique because you have misunderstood it, or perhaps mixing other techniques, or intentionally or unintentionally missing out parts of the instruction. 1st you have to understand how insight is developed with all subtleties. Insight should cover all the following bases: 

In Uddesa Vibhaṅga Sutta one of the main Suttas where the term internally and externally is analysed in detail. Analysis of what internally and externally appears multiple places. Couple quote on this is as follows, but it is best to read the whole Sutta to get a more thought out idea. Summary 

According to Buddhism there are infinite number of beings. The number of Buddhas are like the grains of the sand in the banks of the Ganges. (Infiniti literally. ) The enlightened beings during a Buddha Sasana in also very large. Because there are infinite being though and infinite of beings have crossed don't reduce the number of beings.

Sense impressions are tied to the mental body while conceptual impressions are tied to the physical body. So if you get brain damaged you cannot think and perhaps learn new concepts but past impressions stay, [Mahā,nidāna Sutta] these sense impressions do persist beyond death as part of the Bhavanga Citta. Recallability depends on the level of hindrances. [(Nīvarana) Sangarava Sutta] The mental impressions that remain are part of the mind (Nama) which does not die at death but passes away in one body and arise in another. For further understanding perhaps you can study the Buddhist rebirth process. 

Buddhist scriptures are so old they are not under copyright. Translations maybe. Some are made freely available. Best is just ask the author or do your own translation. Also quoting a small portion may be acceptable as fair use. 

In order to be detached from your thoughts you have to remove covetousness and displeasure due to sensations created by the metal activity of thinking. So be aware of the sensations arising and passing due to mental activity as discussed in Pahāna Sutta. 

There is no explicit way to to do this. If you start thinking and pondering on the Dhamma then this happens. 

(Following is directly from the Theravada Suttas. So compatible with any tradition which accepts the Theravada Tripitaka as the doctrinal basis.) insight and serenity goes hand in hand. In Anapana Sutta the 5th and 6th steps in the 4 steps dealing with sensations has serenity. The 16 Steps of the Anâpāna,sati as satipatthāna The 12 steps for getting into dhyana [mental absorption] [Contemplation of the body] `Step 1—Experiencing a long breath Step 2—Experiencing a short breath Step 3—Experiencing the whole breath (or whole body) Step 4—Calming the breath` [Contemplation of feelings: Entry into dhyana] `Step 5—Arousing joy Step 6—Arousing happiness Step 7—Understanding mental functions Step 8—Calming the joy and happiness` [Contemplation of the mind] `Step 9—Experiencing the mind Step 10—Shining the nimitta [meditation sign] Step 11—Sustaining the nimitta Step 12—Freeing the mind` [Contemplation of dharmas] `The 4 steps to take after emerging from dhyana Step 13—Reflecting on impermanence (anicca) Step 14—Reflecting on fading away [of lust] (virāga) Step 15—Reflecting on cessation [of suffering] (nirodha) Step 16—Reflecting on letting go [of defilements] (patinissagga)` Source: The Discourse on the Mindfulness of the In-and-out-breathing by Piya Tan Upanisa Sutta (read along with Transcendental Dependent Arising A Translation and Exposition of the Upanisa Sutta by Bhikkhu Bodhi), The (eleven) “Without Need of Intention” Discourse - (Ekā,dasaka) Cetanā’karaṇīya Sutta, The (ten) “Without Need of Intention” Discourse - (Dasaka) Cetanā’karaṇīya Sutta and other Suttas covers the formula for liberation (nibiddā formula). Extract from the elven link formulation (formula is more or less the same with minor variations): `(1) For the morally virtuous (sīla,vata), there arises freedom from remorse (appaṭisāra). (2) For the remorseless, there arises joy (pamudita). (3) For the joyful, there arises a zestful mind (pīta,mana). (4) For the zestful minded, there arises a calm body (passaddha,kāya). (5) For the calm-bodied, there arises happiness (sukha). (6) For the happy, there arises concentration (samādhi). (7) For the concentrated, there arises the vision of true reality (yathā,bhūta,ñāṇa). (8) For one who sees true reality, there arises revulsion (nibbidā). (9) For the revulsed, there is letting go [dispassiom] (virāga), (10) For the dispassionare, there is (10) the knowledge and vision of liberation (vimutti,ñāṇa.dassana)` Thus implies serenity is important. Also The Great Sixfold Sense-based Discourse - Mahā Saḷ-āyatanika Sutta mentions the need of both Samatha and Vippassana to be developed in a balanced way though the natural development (meditation method and temperament) one may precede the other though ultimately both develop (Yuga,naddha Sutta - The Discourse on the Twin Path).
