The mathematically interesting question here is when we need to use tools like numerical approximations, differential equations, measures etc. as tools specifically in Real Analysis in our general life. I imagine 90% of people will never need to reuse what calculus they studied in higher education, never mind analysis in broad generality. So no. Finite arithmetic, and the natural numbers, is probably enough to believe in. Of course, if you're a mathematician working in Set Theory, or involved in any kind of mathematically sophisticated science, then yes you should believe in irrational numbers, because of Cantor's proof of the existence of uncountable sets. 

There's no logical fallacy as such here. It's just not a proof of anything substantial. Argument A's soundness or Evidence E and Premise 2 clash in both cases; the question as to which should take priority isn't one that this argument addresses. 

Let's also suppose that Nixon knows Jones personally, and, generally thinking that Jones will be supportive of him, asserts that: 

As an explanation of what you're doing this seems incomplete - how do mixing dry and mixing wet ingredients together relate to one another causally? If mixing dry ingredients together is your intended action, why start with wet ingredients? When you make assertions about your motives or intentions for acting, Davidson thinks that what is going on in practice is you make a description of your action that identifies a primary reason, which may in some way relate to the object that your action is intended to relate to. This primary reason (suitably identified in the terms of some well grounded psychological science) functions as the cause of your action, and so the rules of causality should be taken to apply. In that sense then, your first assertion would appear True and your second would not, because while your intent to mix ingredients would seem to have been caused by your desire to bake a cake, you could quite easily have wanted to mixed dry ingredients together without thereby gaining the motive to mix wet ingredients together. (case: a bowl of mixed fruits and nuts?) Buuuut... Causation itself, especially in the world of psychology, can be difficult to pin down metaphysically. Davidson's wider project (see the comprehensive Stanford Encyclopedia Article for more) aims at finding a framework for modelling an effective and predictive science of human action, and does this by looking at the metaphysics of rational actions and their logical descriptions. 

(where is the syntactic representation of the proposition or sentence L, and is the first order property over codes of propositions or sentences and ideally obtains whenever the proposition or sentence that is coded is true and fails to obtain whenever the proposition or sentence is false) Where's the difference? Well, it makes the notion of restriction much more tenable. We're no longer saying that there is some sentence asserting its own negation (we assume that the propositional liar is simply ill-formed), but rather that there is some sentence that attributes the property of failing to be true to the code that represents that same sentence. This syphons the paradoxicality of the liar off to the realm of syntactic representation of language while still retaining the idea that sentences with self-referential features can be expressed in a more indirect way. It remains open to a classical theorist hoping to construct a theory of truth that they might only have such a sentence being properly definable in the presence of very high large cardinal principles in set theory, for example. Except, of course, Tarski's Theorem means that we're never going to have a complete internal account of truth in a language this way. If we're going classical, our theory is going to have to accept a cut-off point at some point; or, as Tarski puts it, our metalanguage is always going to have to be "essentially richer" than our object language. This isn't such a big deal for most mathematicians, but seems like a serious problem for any hope of giving a formal recovery of a classical theory of truth. Many classical logicians following a similar line to Donald Davidson's reading of Tarski have tried to couch truth theories in an Axiomatic way - we capture the structure of a theory of truth satisfying particular desirable properties and remain agnostic as to whether any such theories correspond to any definable single property, or whether they capture everything that there is to say about a particular language or system of propositions, sentences or assertions. If you're in principle happy to accept the arguments Field and Priest present, but would like to see more developed versions of the replacements for the principles they reject, these theories might be interesting in describing hypothetical systems of truth that some Paracomplete or Paraconsistent theory might ultimately instantiate. Meanwhile, classical logicians are evaluating them in abstraction to consider their proof-theoretic strengths and extracting potential applications. There's a slightly dated SEP article on some of the work in this field which should be of some interest if you're keen on exploring further. 

That is, that if something is necessary then it is in fact true. But system K can't prove this, since its axioms aren't exclusive and exhaustive about what kinds of things are necessary (merely affirming that theorems are among the necessities) What do such logics really mean, in a metaphysical sense? Well, Kripke's way of interpreting the weaker logics builds on the possible worlds model through the use of Frames. In Frame semantics, we have as before a set of possible worlds, but also a binary relation over the set of worlds which we call Accessibility. The idea here is that at each base possible world, some of the other worlds are accessible to it. What is possible at a base world is something that obtains at one world that is accessible to that base, and what is necessary at a base world is something that obtains at every possible world that is accessible to it. In the case of standard (S5) Modal logic, we use a trivial accessibility relation such that every world is accessible to every other world, and so possibility and necessity quantify over all worlds. We can also use Frame semantics to account for weaker modal logics by trimming down what is accessible to any given world, or justifying the addition of new axioms by arguing for certain qualities for an accessibility relation. For instance, if we stipulate as a requirement that our accessibility relation is Reflexive (that any possible world is always accessible to itself) then we'd have a model satisfying Localization. In this way, we can see some models where something might be possibly impossible, but not actually impossible. Consider for instance the case of three possible worlds, , and , where all worlds are accessible to themselves, and and are both accessible to but not to each other. If we are at where a proposition is false, and is also false at but true at , then we can see that is possible at (because it's true at ). However, since is not accessible to , then at , is impossible. So at , is both possible and also possibly impossible. 

Eventually, Godel's Incompleteness proofs showed that no complete axiomatic system can prove its own consistency. This is something of a problem given the role that consistency proofs play in Hilbert's formal understanding, because of the mathematical requirements of proof theory itself. In order to prove the consistency of, say, Peano-Dedekind arithmetic, either we need to prove it in a stronger theory than arithmetic or the theory itself must be understood to be either incomplete or inconsistent (even if it proves its own consistency, it could still do so inconsistently). Hilbert's project is generally thought to have been stopped in its tracks, but the questions it has generated about how we might make logic and maths secure continue to be relevant. Current study in the philosophy of logic tends to focus around how theories about models or proofs can be motivated and develop, whether by appeal to an a priori Kantian intuition, through complex language or symbol games, through human psychology or through some relation between mathematical practice and its role in scientific theorising. 

The idea with this logic is that to actually go wrong with the liar paradox is to prove that from the liar proposition, absurdity follows. Let's see how the proof goes using the above rules from the sentence satisfying . 

One of the philosophical attempts to resolve this issue is found in the work of Immanuel Kant, who proposed a method of Transcendental Argument. His idea was that we should first agree on a protocol of accepted proofs or principles of reasoning or experience, then following on from this to extract from it an ontological commitment to the mathematical or metaphysical structure necessary for such proofs or principles to be accepted. The conclusion will then end up either supporting the existence proof or result in a dispute about the original protocol. Your opponent is keen to press the line that your brain might just be telling you these things. But presumably in order to even propose this line, it must be reasonable to suppose that your brain exists. So something exists. Easy, right? Just press this line home - what does your opponent accept about the world in their various skeptical scenarios, and what does that commit them to? 

Contemporary Consensus is hard to come by in Truth given its broad interest, but the philosophical literature around it is very much motivated by Paradox phenomena following from truth as a component of language. If Truth is taken to have a semantic character, such that it indicates a "real" property in a baseline metaphysics, then we might read proposed strategies for avoiding paradox as an attempt to give a more refined definition of this property. If Truth is more syntactic, such as conceptions of it as a system or algebra of those sentences which we might reasonably call True, then we can read paradox resolution projects as characterising these systems through a combination of axioms and inference rules, which may or may not point to any "real" metaphysical property. In any case, I think it's accurate to note that the question of the substantial nature of Truth is in some sense treated as an afterthought to the current philosophical work being done. The richness of theories of Truth in contemporary treatment is very much mathematical, following on from papers by Alfred Tarski [1], Saul Kripke [2] and others, where we take it that the mathematics used to frame the theory may or may not be suitable to a given metaphysical framework but this shouldn't hold us back from exploring the theories in abstraction. Kripke's work is of particular relevance to your question of whether Bivalence is a central property of Truth, in that while the technology he introduces is widely accepted as a valuable extension of Tarski's work, some philosophers have read his strategy as an endorsement of the existence of truth value gaps, and others as simply an indication of the structure of an axiomatic theory of "the True sentences" which is itself a classical theory, and developed/argued against it accordingly. In addition to SEP links by Lukas and Mauro above, I'll also add the (recently revised) SEP article for Axiomatic Theories of Truth by Volker Halbach and Graham Leigh, discussing one of the big avenues for contemporary developments. 

The natural rebuttal to Russell here is that he has misunderstood the Stoic understanding of Happiness. In choosing their actions and goods in a principle of "Rational decision in accordance with nature", Stoics do not deny what would make them happy. Happiness for the Stoics just is making that choice willfully. Perhaps Russell might be right were he to say that rational decisions in accordance with nature may not give as much scope for pleasure, in a sense in which pleasure extends to things like delight and lust. But for the Stoic, that's not a real kind of happiness. You can still as a Stoic enjoy, for example, food, substances and pursuits in accordance with your own personal nature, without being dominated by the passions that might drive us to pursue these things at the expense of other aspects of our natural selves. Giving in to temptation, while maybe fun, doesn't ultimately yield true happiness, which the Stoics would say is reached through rational choice rather than impulse. (SEP Stoicism) 

I think a clearer notion of objectivity is needed here. Objectivity can't just mean "independent of any thinking or observing subject", because the idea of something being dependent on a thinking or observing subject for its identity is a massively controversial aspect of the philosophy of mind - we don't want to commit ourselves to some kind of substance dualism, or even more conservatively a supervenience thesis about the mental on the physical, to say that some matter of fact is an objective one or not. A more useful notion of objectivity might be derived from Michael Dummett's thoughts on Realism in the philosophy of language. To say that Realism about the material world holds is on one hand to say that the notion of Truth is evidence transcendent (that whatever we might hold to be the ontological structure of the world, the notion of what is True to say about the world is not fully settled by appeals to what kinds of pieces of evidence are available), and on the other to say that it is also classically logically bivalent (that whatever we might have to say on the subject is either true or false - there is no room for contradictions or intermediate or fuzzy truth values in the material world). Maybe these two theses might come apart in interesting ways, but the idea that "objectivity" is supposed to capture both sounds like a reasonable suggestion. This avoids a lot of scrambling around in hypothetical "real worlds" without begging the relevant questions about whether there is indeed any such thing to form a basis for a constructive debate. And also, when the problem becomes a matter of standards of Logic and Evidence, we have a number of different formal technologies available to us to present, explore and consider various ways we might make progress in resolving disputes about whether such and such a phenomenon or hypothesis is properly sensible.

The critical thing to appreciate about Two Dogmas of Empiricism is its context. You mention the idea that we impose "specific assumptions about the domain of discourse" in Quine's analysis of the Cordate/Renate relationship - well, Rudolph Carnap's Logical Empiricist project was exactly about the processes and mathematics in formulating such domains formally to serve as the groundwork for a precise and mathematically rigorous language for scientific analysis, and it is that project's expression of two unanticipated Dogmas that Quine is addressing. If you want to take the line that the domain introduces a new notion of synonymy, you might start by focusing on Carnap's use of State Descriptions. The idea here is that we think of analyticity in terms of a state space of propositions (potentially a probability distribution) whereby if two statements have equivalent truth values in all states, then they are synonymous. Of course if we have a state space in which in some possible state some animals have hearts and do not have kidneys (even if none in fact actually do) then it's not analytic that animals that have hearts have kidneys, but something synthetic, and that thus needs to be subject to synthetic evaluation. The work that the analytic/synthetic distinction is doing for Carnap is to show that you can start from the grounding of mathematical axiomatics, and then add something further to this to help elaborate how scientific theorizing can be done in a formally rigorous way. The analytical truths are covered once we've accepted the legitimacy of the mathematical explication (which we suppose to be well-founded in mathematical practice), and the synthetic truths are those that are determined when you go out into the world and test. But for Quine, it's not that simple. Carnap's theory of State Descriptions is, in principle, syntactic. When I give the suggestion above that there might be some possible state where animals have hearts and do not have kidneys, in Carnap's theory this is certainly a legitimate state to introduce into our framework prior to any sort of empirical investigation. It might so happen that we later on get to a stage where we realize that the only states that are consistent with the available evidence are ones where hearts and kidneys are indeed coextensive. But even then, we wouldn't say that the statement is Analytic. Indeed, we've had to go through a process of synthetic investigation to get to that stage. If we call things "Synonymous" at this stage and use this to ground a notion of "analyticity" then that's fine, but it's not going to be a notion of "analyticity" that does the work that Carnap wants to put it to. So coextension alone doesn't decide the matter of what should be deemed prior analytical knowledge. What about situations where we might think that two statements are simply coextensive "simpliciter", by virtue of meaning? Quine points to the case of "All Bachelors are Unmarried" as a candidate example. But to point to "meaning" doesn't really help us out here. In Carnap's State Description framework, we start by identifying the full modality of propositions as distinct. If we want to say "John is a Bachelor" and "John is Unmarried" as expressing two distinct propositions in Carnap's proposal then we're going to identify a state (in fact a whole partition of the state pace) where one is true and the other is false. If we want to appeal to "meaning" then we need to add new, distinct postulates to tell us when two things mean the same and when they mean something different; this is the kind of external appeal that we were hoping to avoid by relying on the mathematics rather than theories of properties or forms. Quine traces this idea of meanings and synonymy through the next few sections of his paper and ultimately can't see any way for Carnap to get out of it.
