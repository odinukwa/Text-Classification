Hence, the question: is there any pattern on how various languages expose idiomaticity and indirection? I'm also wondering if there's any academic research on this matter. 

Summary. Individual meanings of morphemes may be irregular or vanished in complex words. The meaning of a resulting word may be too far from sum of meanings of its morphemes. One can deconstruct an arbitrary word, but it may be hard to construct it from known morphemes. The only way to know the differences is memorizing. 

I've been reading this article about linguistic idiomaticity, and there's a good research on English idioms and indirect speech, in general. I've been thinking on different amounts of idiomaticity in various languages. I haven't seen any academic researches that would compare languages side-by-side, but my naive assumption was the following: 

TL;DR: Infinitive suffix "-ти" and 3rd person singular present "-тъ" are essentially different. They could reduce independently in Slavonic languages, but if they are both reduced, this seems to be just a coincidence. 

Noun groups If one word has no declension while the other has, the GG of the whole group is given by the word that has declension. 

Living in your home country, you naturally communicate using your local dialect. Be it American English, British English, etc. Note that another, non-local dialect still may cause a bit of problem, e.g. for different idiomatic constructs. Living in a foreign country, you are surrounded with people who use Simple English, obviously because English is L2 for them. This makes you to change your habits of using your own language, otherwise they would misunderstand you too often. Ability of «speaking rather slowly, using simple words» is essentially what is meant here. So, you have really acquired another language. And you have not lost your L1. Simple proof is that you still comprehend it when listening or reading. The real challenge is obtaining an ability to quickly switch between the languages (dialects), and this is where you should probably point your efforts to. 

Say, you are curious to know how Latin became modern French . You then build the following chain of transitions. Note, each transition has occurred not just in , but in entire set of words having corresponding phonemes (or combinations of phonemes): 

As you mentioned, this very example of elision had mostly religious (not linguistic) reason, so the change may be irregular. 

This distinction within the line (RTL vs. LTR) can be resolved in a different manner. Some formatting standards assume detection by text codepage; others, like XSL-FO, are being specifically instructed by writing-mode property. So it will be naturally Option D. You should also consider that RTL does not imply Bottom-to-Top. This is why Option A is not relevant. Note that Option E is essentially the same as Option D, only having text alignment set to both, except that the quotation mark will be aligned together with the first word of the Hebrew text since there is no breakable space in (1). I must admit that you have prepared your question very well, so I don't even need screenshots! :) 

Note as you see, I prefer IPA over RTGS as it provides with complete information over the tones, vowel lengths, and so on. Yet another note: Paiboon is a publishing agency that has published a famous book for Thai language learners, so it takes its own place within the system. A personal note: ISO 11940 is a horrible thing, Google Translate uses it, so stay way from it. :-) 

Each of them convey a different message and therefore they can be represented with two distinct syntax trees. It is only a coincidence that they look identically in English. Now, if you try to express these two phrases in an arbitrary language, you need to obey the language's Government and binding rules that would bind your subject, verb, and object into a phrase. These rules may or may not involve noun cases, particles, articles, bound morphemes, word order, or whatever language tools existing in the language. For every language, sooner or later you'll find pairs of messages that produce two identical phrases. Noun cases can make your search a bit longer, no more. Also, it worth mentioning that such ambiguity has produced an entire type of humor (sometimes, anti-humor), called Pun. Attempt to find an unambiguous phrase structure grammars is one of the major reasons for inventing constructed languages. For example, Lojban has been deliberately designed for eliminating syntactical ambiguity. We can naturally assume that if there was a natural language with no ambiguity, Lojban would have been never created. 

As per why the character makes programmers' hell (just in case if you wonder). Most of the modern-day compilers allows Unicode identifiers (e.g., variable names). You may write your program with variables in your (non-English) language, and your program works just fine. However, using may lead you into a trouble because it may or may not be considered a symbol. Here's what happens (assume that is the Mongolian Vowel Separator): 

I think, it's natural evolution of the language, and it exposes no threats. Languages evolve. In fact, languages never stop developing (except Latin). New words appear, new semantic constructs arise, others fade out or disappear. You can't stop this process. We all use "i.e.", "e.g.", "etc.", "$", "&", and it made no harm to the language. 

The same Wikipedia article also refers many other consonant clusters of English and rules of their (modern) pronunciation. There are also academic works on the subject: 

You have actually answered your question. According to the examples given, possessive is formed with the following pattern: 

Summary. The consonant clusters exist in many languages. They may appear contracted (reduced) in various manners within the language or its dialects. Each language has its own laws of phonetic harmony, and such contraction occurs according to these laws. There's no common rule, except the statement that the phenomenon exists. 

Your question is very interesting and challenging. I dare to say that vowels are not more prone to change, generally. Although it is the case in Germanic languages, this is not true in general. What triggers languages to change Schleicher is usually considered the first linguist who suggested that languages evolve in a similar manner to biological processes. Therefore, it would be accurate to assume that language changes are similar to biological mutations. As all mutations, these changes are random by their nature. Randomness imply that there is no natural preference over vowels or consonants. Why vowels, not consonants English, likewise many other Germanic languages, have a very developed vowel set. Look at these maps. Note: only monophthongs are listed, no tones, no vowel length. English (16 key points) 

Sorry for a too short answer, but I guess the entire question can be answered in this way: The original phrase assumes an omitted word: 

I see no contradiction here: Lao: ຊ (ຊ ຊ້າງ) is a direct equivalent of Thai: ช ช้าง This even includes the meaning of the verbose name of the consonant ("an elephant"). Many other words "behave" the same, they preserve their written forms but pronounced according to each language's standards: 

I think, there are several reasons why some languages have developed a broad variety of particles (e.g. Thai) while other have not (nor there are any historical evidences they have ever been). Of course, Confucian culture made a great impact on this, with its idea of saving one's face and harmonious relations are often at premium. Use of the appropriate polite particle in a sentence can add just the right amount of politeness for human communication. However, you are right asking the question here. There are researches (1; PDF) that suggest pure linguistic reasons for particles have been more developed in tonal languages. Indeed, a non-tonal language uses stress and tone to change the feeling and mood of a sentence. Asking someone, "What are you doing?", depending on the tone of the voice, can completely change the meaning from a greeting to a rude command. A tonal language, where the meaning of a word is determined by the pitch of the voice, uses particles, usually tacked onto the end of a sentence, to convey emotion and feeling. If you tried to express feeling and mood through intonation of voice, it may interfere with the tone (and therefore meaning) of a word. A side note, Japanese used to be a tonal language. There are relics of tones, like 高低アクセント. However, in Thai language, even nouns or verbs may change depending on your relation to the listener (e.g. younger versus elder person, monks or royal family members). E.g. has polite and informal forms. They don't seem to be derived from tonal nature of the language, but most of the formal words I'm aware of are derived from ancient Pali/Sanskrit background. So, to summarize the answer to your question: Many Asian languages had reasons to develop a set of polite particles, primarily because of their tonal nature, but also because of cultural reasons like harmony and saving one's face. 

Accent, by definition, is a set of habits. In other words, a person can be comfortable with a certain set of language-related habits and, when they need to speak in another language, they naturally bring their existing habits to how they speak the second language. This is what accent actually is. Say, phonetically, if one continuously exercise both rolling and postalveolar approximant (like in Hindi and English, correspondingly) or both and (the latter is rare in Hindi), they have much greater chance of accent-less speech. Note however, the accent is not only a phonetic phenomenon; it can also be in how the speaker constructs phrase, uses conjugations, etc. Yet another important factor is using language-specific idiomatic expressions as a result of cultural exposure. The factor of age works just like for any other habit, allowing the person to grasp knowledge/habits faster. 

Sound change is exceptionless. In other words, it is regular; Sound change has no memory — just like in your examples, if words obtained as in "good" and "book", they will undergo further changes together, even if their history was completely different; Sound change ignores grammar. Instead, grammar follows them. This is why we see many words with irregular grammar, like "blood" versus "book" in English, weak double consonants in Ukrainian, and so forth. 

Although a naive algorithm will find negative words ("nonsense", "I don't think"), the entire message conveys a positive idea. Finally, you will end up with a semantic graph, like this: 

Note: I'm not familiar with Khmer, so mistakes are very possible. To type the entire text, you may experiment with online Khmer keyboard plus some online translator (like Google or Bing) to get a meaningful result. You may also refer some basic reference for Khmer consonants and vovels to know how to read it. Note, your browser may not show the fonts properly (or, let me say, the most nice ones). It depends on the fonts used to display StackExchange. See how it looks in my browser (above) versus the Lexilogos Web site (below). 

"The message" is singular, hence, "datum". It is easy to suppose that "this message" may at some languages/areas change its meaning slightly: "these statements are given…" or "these scripts are given…", both plural, hence, "data". Since the difference is very slight, it can be supposed that singular/plural variants may cycle, even in the same areas. 

Summarizing all above, you are taking a very large task. Even for a single dialect of a single language (e.g., American English), it would require thousands of man-hours of work. Nevertheless, if you're still desperate to write it, I wish you the best luck. 

Although it is not precisely what you need, your conlang may employ ablative or elative for this purpose (if you don't worry that "I'm away from home+ABL" would clash with "I'm leaving home+ABL"). 

As a side note, an automated speech recognizer should be able to determine at which point of the chart the speaker's voice stays at a given moment. Having this in place, detecting diphthongs is no more difficult than finding a gesture on a 2D map, and there are plenty of effective algorithms for it. 

Here, the determiner the is treated as a part of a genitive phrase the car's. Abney 2 suggested an idea that the NP is headed with a determiner (D) to solve the problem with determiners. So these notations simply reflect two different frameworks. 1 Chomsky, Noam. (1995). The Minimalist Program. 2 Abney, Steven. (1996) A Grammar of Projections. 

For English, you probably forgot articles. Other languages usually have different sets of parts of speech (or lexical classes), and the Wikipedia article provides with a decent list of those. For a more detailed analysis, check David Beck's "The Typology of Parts of Speech Systems", chapter 4 "Types of lexical inventory". 

One theory is that climate plays an important role on developing (or suppressing) features of languages local to a region. In other words, tonal languages arise in warm and humid regions (usually, with subtropical climate). This question (and answers to it) may shed some light: Influence of the climate and geography on the phonemes This answer refers a work named „Climate, vocal folds, and tonal languages: Connecting the physiological and geographic dots” by Caleb Everett, Damián E. Blasi and Seán G. Roberts. Here's an excerpt (highlight mine), which is self-evident: 

In my understanding, you are trying to set the limits for redundancy, regarding the case endings. I think, the direct answer to this question depends on your conlang's articulatory stress patterns: 

You will probably hear examples of the last item by yourself, even in Central Thailand. For instance, people pronounce the negative particle ไม่ as , like in: 

Further, each language has its own tools for delivering finer details of sense. These tools can be syntactical ones — separate parts of speech (like articles) in some languages, or morphological ones (like affixes). 

Your question sounds simple, but it unveils an entire area of human activity, a Natural Language Processing. The problem is that natural languages convey the content in a linked manner. It means that a phrase "build a car fueled by water" can't stand alone. Instead, it is bound to various objects, like this: I (came up with (an idea of (how (to build a car (that is fueled by water))))). An actor, "I" is linked to an idea ("a car that is...") through a hierarchy of relations, or links. Hence, your data mining system has to follow the entire sequence, otherwise it would be quickly confused with phrases like this:
