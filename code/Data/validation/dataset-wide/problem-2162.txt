I have a question probably a repeated situation faced by most of the people. I find socializing very difficult as I always feel what others think about me. Because of that, I stay silent all the time and Interact very less with people. In short I talk with very few people and people doesn't talk much with me. I am new to my job and I find this socializing factor very difficult to adopt. Can someone suggest me how to over come this complex? Thanks! 

I am working for an IT company and recently got moved to a different team. Obviously, under a different Manager. My Manager is so compatible in all terms. However,I have a problem. I am not able to understand his way of talking. In other words, I don't understand his accent. Is there any way I can overcome this? Because of this, I blink in meetings and unable to respond promptly. Can I confess about this to my Manager or Is there any other way to Manage such situations? Thanks! If this question is a repetition, Let me know the original link as I am not able to spot that one. 

It's totally illegal, and poor management practice. I instead would offer as a manager to provide incentive to those who prevent skips if it was a legitimate problem. For instance, everyone who has no skips gets a 5$ bonus at the end of the week. This way they're still mitigating some of the direct risk and providing an incentive for you to check up on the customers. They could even do things like having a team outing if the entire team has no skips for x number of days/weeks. 

If this is US/Canada/UK or somewhere else that treats transgenders generally more favorable than the rest of the world (none of them are perfect mind you, but generally more favorable); I would combine best practices of interviewing to get around your situation. On the resume I give to them/hand in before the interview, use only your new name, as even for women who get married, etc.; that is not uncommon. However...bring a modified version of the same resume, that contains BOTH names to the interview. Don't put this one online if you have fear of the online world discriminating against you/exposing your previous life. Just make the modification, saying "Formerly known as Jane/John Doe", don't even save it, and print it. I don't personally care which order it happened, but I'm just going to use Jane to John as an example; if most of your former experience was as Jane and only a tiny bit as John, I would put the "Formerly known as Jane Doe" at the top of the resume. If most of your experience is under your new name, and not your old, I would put "previously known as Jane Doe" next to just the individual items, if they're important. This calls less attention to them, but still discloses everything to your manager. If you're in an environment that is less permissive/more discriminatory: keep your current resume intact, leave no contact information on there for any of the companies. Then, have a separate reference sheet, that you bring to the interview with you, and only give to them after the interview is over, that lists the "Formerly known as John/Jane Doe" on it. If it is absolutely imperative that your manager simply not know your previous name/your transgender (or if your previous experience is likely to be verified pre-interview): provide resume and reference with just the new name, and then make a note at the bottom of the resume in italics or something that says something to the following: "Note: Due to a change in life circumstances, previous experience is under a different name. Details on how to verify this experience, for my own protection, will be provided to appropriate HR personnel." That discloses the name change, without actually disclosing the previous name, people's names can be changed for a variety of reasons: marriage, divorce, adoption, transgender, witness protection, immigration, etc. Some of those could be just as sensitive, and the manager then knows there's a reason for the name change, that you had a name change, but does not know why, and knows it must be kept private. At that point if verifying your experience is important, the manager will call/bring in the HR department to contact you and verify your experience. 

Are you senior to them at all or are they the exact same level as you? I’m assuming that they are the same level. If at all possible, try to return the favour in some way. Maybe on a quieter day for you, you could assist at least some of them? Also, if you have an otherwise good relationship with them, you could talk to them about it and sympathise with the fact that it’s taking away from their own work (not apologise, but sympathise). They’re less likely to screw up for you if they consider you a friend. I wouldn’t say to them that they have already been doing a bad job, you’re just trying to sweeten them up at this stage. Then, if the problem continues, you can say to them as a friend that they need to improve the quality of their work. 

You and me both, I feel your pain! Here’s a few of my tricks: To relax your eyes, look out a window at the horizon for a few seconds. Focusing on a faraway object relaxes your retinas. Slowly rotate your ankles as many times as you remember throughout the day. Find any excuse to stand up and walk around – water fountain, bathroom, pacing while thinking about a problem, anything! Use your lunch break to get a bit of exercise as well as just eat, especially if you can walk around a park rather than go to the gym. Stretch your arms, rotate your shoulders and arch your back whenever you feel the first hint of stiffness, this helps keep the headaches at bay. Open your mouth wide like you’re yawning to release tension in your jaw. Sit with your bum right into the back of the chair, don’t slouch. And adjust the height of your chair so you don’t have to either curve your back or peer up to look at your screen. Ask your partner to rub your shoulders and back a few times a week. 

Asking would be the right thing to do.Because rewards are not just "Rewards", they are your motivation for next contribution.The best way to have your work recognized is by discussing your results. And by making sure your boss knows how you like to be recognized. Being more interactive among the team is also one of the way of letting your Employer know that you are performing well. Perhaps, the below link that I came across, might help you. $URL$ 

@Catess76 - Hello! Job hunting is always a challenge and deciding upon one offer among multiple choice is more challenging today. But I'ts good to have a hard game as this decision means how good your decision making and analysing capabilities are. Now, I faced the similar situation, I had two offers on hand and I had to decide on one. My best choice was based on my requirements. A job decision doesn't means salary alone.This includes the commute,your stay,facilities, benefits,Future growth,technology and your ability of survival. Beyond everything, your heart will always look towards one choice which will always be the best to choose. So, decide and select your job after evaluating all the pros and cons thoroughly. But, make sure you decide quickly as the second offer shouldn't go away from your hand. The below link that I came across will be helpful for you to decide. $URL$ I believe this article will be relatively helpful for you to decide upon. All the very best! 

It really depends on the severity of the cold. If you're just "getting over it", going with the suggestion by n_palum seems reasonable, a simple thing like telling them you'd shake their hand, but not today, that you're just getting over a cold. It informs them that you were sick, and you are managing now and are concerned for their own welfare. If you're still actively in the middle of it hard, sneezing, coughing, difficultly talking/swallowing water, etc. I'd simply call the interviewer and tell them "hey, I hate to do this, but can we re-schedule the interview, I'm really not feeling well and don't want to give the wrong impression nor make anyone sick." Any reasonable company/interviewer should gladly reschedule the interview for you; if not, from personal experience, I'd walk away. 

Depending on the country/region your in, this could make a huge difference in both laws and immediate perception; so to give an honest, accurate answer we would have to know the country/region you reside in. This depends on the work you're applying for, and the amount of experience you have, and credentialing and under what names those are. If for instance you're interviewing for a Master Electrician position, but your electrical work and experience, and guild/union membership is all under your previous name, you pretty much have to list your previous name, or start over, or risk explaining in the middle of the interview. if they corner you into asking for a membership card or something; which if you're afraid of initial discrimination/impression, could come off far worst. If you're applying for a software position, then experience is usually checked beforehand. If you're applying for a sales experience, in some industries, its very rarely if ever checked; the interview is your chance to make or break it. Is this a small or large company? If its a small company, your manager might/will probably already know even if that information is provided to HR later. HR's primary job is not to protect the people, its to protect the company by managing the people. The best way for HR to protect the company in this case, is to inform your manager and let your manager know, in case anyone under your manager finds out, or in case someone else is legitimately discriminating against you, so that your manager can report the incident and address it quickly without being caught off guard. If this is a really large company, then HR might decide to keep it private, especially if you're not interviewing for a management/executive position. Most of the entry-line managers are kept in the dark about a lot of things, they're more project leads/shift leads, that also happen to have the ability to hire/fire, by pushing everything through HR, and since everything will go through HR anyways, HR just keeps them in the dark. 

As has been said before, the best thing to do is present solutions to the problem rather than focusing on blame. However, if it's the sort of work environment where people will directly ask who is responsible, then it's understandable to worry that you look like you're dodging the question by focusing on solutions. And, as you say, if you are the person most associated with that project, people will assume it was your fault. Even if you are most associated with the project, it is a team project and everyone's responsibility to be sure that the work is good enough quality before presenting it in a meeting. I would suggest avoiding allocating blame to either yourself or your teammate but accepting responsibility as a unit. Having said that, if your teammate is sitting silently while you are grilled about his fudge-ups, I'd talk to him about that!
