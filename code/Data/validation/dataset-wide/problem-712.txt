I have adjusted the "B tension" on old bottom-end Shimano junker derailleur very similar to this one. Though there is no screw for the adjustment, what you can do is drill another hole for the B axle spring, to create a lower tension position that will bring the jockey wheel closer to the cog for better shifting (which I'm guessing is almost certainly the adjustment you want to make, judging by the picture, showing a very sagging jockey wheel on the highest gear.) Since there is hardly a shred of aluminum to be found in these things, you're drilling though steel, I'm afraid. Use a carbide drill bit if you have one, go easy and slow and take your time. Don't do what I did: namely, don't drill a new spring hole through the hanger, which is a fairly thick plate of steel; drill it on the opposite side, in the B axle housing, if you can. On the hanger side, the new hole hole is retarded relative to the old one (counter-clockwise or backwards rotation around the axle) to bring about more looseness so the jockey wheel is pulled closer to the cogs. On the opposite side, of course, it is backwards: the hole is advanced relative to the old one. I seem to recall that the "C clamp" on the B-axle is underneath the black plastic cover through which protrude the H and L trim screws. That can be gently popped off with a screwdriver, immediately revealing the axle end with the clamp on it, which can be popped off, after which the whole pivot assembly separates from the hanger, and the spring comes out. Though this is a fun thing to do, you can replace the whole derailleur with its modern low equivalent: a Shimano Tourney TX-55, pretty much the Shimano bottom end as far as derailleurs go. Anyway, these Tourneys have the angled geometry of the pivot to track left-right in a way that tries to follow the variation in cog size (unlike your SIS derailleur which tracks horizontally), and they have that darned B-tension screw. 

It's not normal, especially if you have only a double crankset! I've set up triples such that they have no noise in any combination. And that's cheap components. Think 8 speed bike with Shimano Altus FD, thick 6-8 speed chain. I recently set up an incorrect front derailleur on an 8 speed bike, with its original shifter: a Shimano SLX "Dyna-Sys" FD for 10 speeds. Using a 9 speed chain and some tinkering, plus a very slight unorthodox rotation of the derailleur around the seat post away from perfectly parallel (it's a clamp-on, not direct mount), I got it so that it has no noise on the middle and small ring, any cog, and only a bit of chain rub in the largest-cog-largest-ring combination. If mismatched hacks like this can be made to work, there can be no excuses from the bike shop selling you a brand new bike for over $1000, in which components should match, and be properly set up. They are not a department store; they should know what they are doing. From the fact that you have a rub on the smallest cog, which progresses to the second smallest cog when you shift the FD to the left to the middle ring, suggests that the FD is positioned a little too far to the left: either it could use a little more cable tension. What you can do is relax the high/low trim screws and get it as good as you can on both rings by cable tension; then play with the trim screws. 

In my opinion, the frame is toast. You can drill a hole ahead of a crack to try to keep it from spreading. Determining where "ahead of the crack" lies is guesswork. You can't see where the crack ends because: 

Luckily for you, it doesn't matter, because you do not need more than 50 psi in 1.75" tires; it's around perfect. For most of the summer, I rode my 1.75's 45 psi rear, 40 front. Currently running 50/45. Refer to this table. The 1.75" thickness lands between 1.7 and 1.9; around 51 psi is the baseline recommended from both. You probably want a little more in the rear and less in the front. You're close enough there. The 80 psi stamped on the is the maximum, not the best pressure for optimal performance. 

You have it backwards. When you stand up, your legs (bent at the knee) provide suspension, separating the unsprung mass (the bicycle) from the weight of your body. This is easier on the bike, not harder. Though the bike complies with the bumps, it does not have to deal with your mass in doing so. (Well, strictly speaking, standing is harder on your pedals, cranks and bottom bracket, but overall it is easier on the frame.) When you're seated, there is still some suspension from your butt and whatever springiness is in the seat, but it's not as effective. The jolts you're feeling are being transmitted through the wheels and frame. Your bike can't "take it instead of you" because if you're taking it, you're taking it through the bike, not directly from the road. 

That said, it should be easy to get to 50 psi with your pump. If you're struggling to get there, there is some issue there. One common source of frustrations is that the pin inside the pump's chuck (the part that you clamp on to the inner tube's valve) is not pressing down on the valve stem to open the valve. This is a problem with Schrader valves somewhat more than with Presta valves, because in addition to both types of valves being held in place by pressure, the Schrader valve stem is spring-loaded. Many cheap pumps have a plastic valve pin inside the chuck. These plastic pins tend to get marred and deformed and stop pressing down on the pin properly. Before buying a bicycle pump, look inside the chuck and make sure it has a metal pin (such as brass). When attaching the chuck to the valve, you must press firmly. The dial on the pressure gauge should jump to indicate the tire pressure (except when the tire is completely flat). You then know that the valve is open. At that point, flip the lever to clamp the chuck. If you clamp the chuck before the needle has moved, you're clamping it on with the valve still closed; it will be impossible to pump. 

Because you say that this happens when the bike is already in motion, I suspect that what you're experiencing is normal. In most bicycles, the rear hub has a ratchet mechanism which allows it to freewheel in one direction. This means that when the bicycle rolls forward under its own momentum (or down hill), the pedals do not move. Moreover, you can pedal backward even while moving forward. This also means that in order to feel any resistance, you have to pedal sufficiently fast for the speed at which you are going and the gear that you are in. If you do not pedal fast enough, it feels as if there is no tension in the chain, because in fact there isn't: the hub is moving faster than you, and freewheeling, and so the chain isn't exerting any torque. You must pedal faster or switch to a higher gear (if possible). 

Many BSO's are styled like mountain bikes, probably because the mountain bike features tend to be appealing to people who don't know a lot about bicycles. Consumers buy these bicycles even though they will never use them on anything resembling a mountain trail. A thick frame, thick, knobby tires, and suspension make a bicycle look rugged. The appearance of ruggedness is cheaply achieved with inferior components that don't last, are poorly serviceable and heavy. This is because the mere appearance of anything is cheaply achieved with a prop which looks like the real thing. If consumers believed that road bike features comprise the best prototype for an all-purpose bicycle, then BSO's would be road-bike-shaped objects. Even the very mass of a bicycle could be associated with ruggedness. Consider that Beats by Dre headphones were found to contain metal weights that serve no purpose other than to make the product feel more massive. This is because the consumer who knows nothing about audio or electronics thinks that a pair of cans that weighs more must be better. (Though there is a point there: better loudspeakers tend to have more massive magnets, which make them more sensitive.) (With regard to tires, there seems to be a widespread belief that the mountain bike tires will grip all kinds of surfaces better, including asphalt: in other words, that they are safer. This is quite unfortunate. Consumers should be educated, for the sake of their own safety, that smooth tires provide the best grip on a wet road, in addition to offering a smoother, quieter ride with less rolling resistance). Someone shopping for a road bike is different from the crowd, and probably more knowledgeable than the average consumer. Possibly much more knowledgeable. They won't be duped by low-quality components. 

Since the rings, cogs and chain are new, and decent components we can safely eliminate the possibility that there is a problem with the chain grabbing the rings or cogs. Here is what I suspect might be happening: it's your derailleur: due to wear, damage or perhaps weakened springs. Here is how: as you pedal, the chain temporarily catches in the derailleur cage. The next thing that happens is that, since the chain is not moving through the derailleur, the entire derailleur is pulled by the chain and rotated backwards, which basically peels/unwraps the chain from the cassette until it loses grip. You only notice this when there is significant load on the chain, like going uphill. Under light load, you just need one or two teeth of grip, if the chain and cassette are new. There is no substitute for having someone watch what is going on. Or attaching a camera to a chain stay or seat stay to record what is going on. If the derailleur is the culprit, you probably wasted money on the new crankset. Two-year old rings are probably still okay, and in any case, individual rings can be replaced, not the entire crankset. 

You can put smooth tires ("slicks") on a mountain bike wheel rim instead of the usual "knobbies". These slicks can be in the typical 1.95" mountain bike tire diameter, or you can go narrower down to 1.75". Regarding the bikes in the garage which needs brakes, seats, tires and possibly gears; those are not very expensive items. Tires are about twenty dollars; used seats in good condition can be had for a few dollars. If you'd like higher gear ratios, it is not expensive to swap a casette or freehub. Find out which one your bikes use. Probably, I would guess, these mountain bikes have thread-on freehubs that remove with a FR-1 tool (which should cost under $10, and needs a big wrench to go with it). A new freewheel hub costs about $20 to $30, and gives you an opportunity to increase the gear ratios. The swap is a five minute job. However, once the repair budget for some cheap old mountain bike surpasses about $50, it quickly stops making sense. Instead of spending $100 on maintenance, you can get something newer and in better condition for $75 and spend $25 on it, ending up with a better bike. How much is your time worth? Many DIY-ers make the mistake of treating their labor as being free, and only counting the cost of tools and materials! "Look at the bike I put together with a $100 budget!" (And with only 20 hours of my "free" time put in). 

When you're adjusting the position of the brake pads, you must squeeze the brake and check the closed position. The pads should line up nicely with the rim in the braking position. With the pads loosened, squeeze the brake with one hand, and adjust their position with the other hand, without losing a grip on the brake, and tighten them to fix the positions. Then release the brake and tighten the pads more, to fully secure them, ensuring that they do not rotate or move during tightening. Squeeze the brake again and check the position and fix if necessary. Make sure that you understand the brake wear compensation bolt, located at the grip. As the brake pads wear, this hollow bolt is unscrewed to compensate (tighten the cable). It has a nut on it which is then used to tighten it in a given position. Manipulating this bolt and nut is a key skill for the cyclist with these types of brakes. This wear compensation bolt can be a useful tool in setting up the brakes: 

You can do squats with another person on your back. If you do proper squats (almost all the way down) they are a lot harder, and a 110 pound girlfriend can be as effective as if you were using a barbell more than twice that weight for half-squats (knees going only to about 90 degrees). Never go all the way down, and never bounce. 

Another hypothesis is that as the pin-to-link mating surfaces wear, they create an increasing gap for the entry of dirt. Once dirt gets between the parts, wear accelerates due to a "wet sanding" action. At first smaller particles are able to enter, then larger ones as the clearance increases. Eventual displacement of the fairly heavy-bodied factory lubricant might be a factor. Exaggerated diagrams of the idea follow. Here is the state of a new chain: the pin is firmly pressed into the link with no clearance: 

Say you have a front derailleur cited as having an 18T range, with a 42T main ring. According to the specification, the smallest inner ring can be 24T. But how strict is that? Is it possible to get away with 22T? In particular if the expected use of this ring is very rare: you climb that 25 feet of vertical rock face, and then shift back to one of the other rings. Similarly for 28 versus 26, et cetera. For example, I have a bike here whose derailleur doesn't go lower than 28T according to spec, and that's the size of the inner ring. But when the chain is on that ring, there is a quite a bit of clearance left between the chain and the cage. I can push the chain down down so that it touches the midpoint of the chain-stay. Then it just about touches the bottom of the cage.
