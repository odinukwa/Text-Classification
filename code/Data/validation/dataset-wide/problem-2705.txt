If your question means, is it possible to express any sentence of a natural language such as English in a logical formalism, such as first order predicate logic (FOPL), then the answer is no. Natural languages are richer and more expressive than formal ones. Consider FOPL, such as you might learn it from an introductory text book. It does not have the resources to express indexicals such as "I", "you", "here", "now", etc. So you cannot express "I am hungry". The nearest you can get is Hungry(john) where john is your name. It only allows quantification over things, not properties, propositions or classes, so you cannot express, "everything John says is true". It does not as standard quantify over entities such as events, so you cannot say "John ran quickly so John ran" - although Davidson made a good showing of how we might remedy that limitation. It does not allow you to quantify over fictional or hypothetical entities. It does not have the resources to express temporal relations such as "it was raining yesterday but not today" - although again there are temporal extensions to logic that can help. It does not express modal relations such as "it is possible that...", "it is obligatory that...", "you must...". Again, modal logics attempt to fill in this gap with partial success. It does not express speech acts such as questions, promises, threats, expostulations, etc., e.g. it cannot express the simple sentence "Damn!", let alone something subtle like "I now pronounce you husband and wife". It does not express the attributive nature of some adjectives, e.g. "this is a good knife" does not simply mean this is good and this is a knife. It does not attempt to express pragmatic features of language use, such as conversational implicatures, e.g. it does not express the fact that "A and B" might carry the implicature of ordered events. It cannot cope with intensional contexts such as the propositional attitudes, e.g. "Mary thinks that...", "John hopes that...", "Carol fears that...". It is bivalent, so it does not cope well with statements where one might say there is a degree or truth, or no truth of the matter, such as vague statements. Some of the above limitations can be overcome by using extensions to logic, e.g. temporal logic, modal logics, higher order logics, etc., but (a) none of these work completely, (b) the more complex you make the logical apparatus, the less likely you are to have a proof system or model system for it, so there is a diminishing return in utility, (c) there is still a substantial residue of English usage that does not fit. FOPL and its extensions are still very useful. I hope I haven't put you off studying it. But it is well to understand their limitations. 

I would say this is similar to what is sometimes called "argument to moderation". The most common cases of this take the form of arguing that some position is plausible because it lies between two others that are more extreme. It appeals to our willingness to seek a compromise in order to resolve a disputed claim, but it is not of itself a cogent argument that one of the extremes is false. In your example, one might gloss the argument as saying maybe I didn't go to Mars, or maybe I went there riding on a paperclip, so let's compromise and say I went in a spaceship. 

is far too strong. No such proportionality can be justified. At most one might claim that an increase in the number of occurrences has a tendency to increase the strength of the conclusion. 

is purely extensional. It is true if everything that is a kid shouts at everything that is a plant. Extensional relations may be just 'accidental'. It may be, for example, that everyone in the train carriage where I sit has brown hair. But if that is so, it is unlikely there is anything stronger than simple demographics at work: most people where I live have brown hair. Accidental generalisations do not support the corresponding counterfactual conditionals. We would not believe that if Donald Trump were in this train carriage, he would have brown hair. Also, sentence 1 would become true if I went on a crusade to exterminate every child who didn't shout at plants, or to exterminate all plants that weren't being shouted at. It would even be trivially true if there were no kids at all, or no plants at all. But often we wish to express something stronger: a relation between the properties themselves. For example, when we say "all ravens are black", this suggests that there is something about 'ravenhood' that causes 'blackness'. Maybe there are some albino ravens, but for the most part the genetic constitution of ravens disposes them to have black feathers. This fact supports the counterfactual conditional: if this bird were a raven it would be black. Properties and relations may be extensionally equivalent without being intensionally equivalent. To borrow an example from Quine: if we define 'cordate' to mean a species of animal that has a heart, and 'renate' to be a species of animal that has kidneys, then these two properties are co-extensive, but are not intensionally equivalent and do not mean the same thing. A similar thing can be true of relations. Philosophers who hold to 'property realism' maintain that there are universal properties that exist independently of our thoughts. Some also hold that laws of nature are relations between these universal properties. Laws of nature are not merely extensional in character. "Every body on which no net force acts remains at rest or in a state of constant velocity" is a law, even though for all we know there are no bodies in the universe on which no net force acts, which would make it extensionally trivial. Thus, expressing "all kids shout at plants" as something like 

Aristotle in the Politics wrote about the nature of money, and his views remained highly influential at least until the end of the 19th century. According to Aristotle the purpose (telos) of money is threefold: 

Your sentence implies its own falsity, therefore it is false. However, its being false does not imply that it is true. As such, it might be said to be half of the liar paradox. In a liar paradox ("this sentence is not true") the truth of the sentence implies its falsity, while its falsity implies its truth. There is a huge amount of literature trying to explain the liar paradox. I wouldn't say your example is genuinely paradoxical, it is merely strange to say something that implies its own falsehood. Another example would be "all generalisations have exceptions". This is clearly itself a generalisation, so if it is true, it has an exception, which implies that it is false. But it being false does not imply that it is true, so it is simply false.
