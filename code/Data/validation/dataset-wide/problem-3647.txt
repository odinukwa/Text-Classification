The foundation of any good diet to make “gains” (build muscle mass) is high quality complex carbohydrates. I.E. oatmeal, sweat potatoes, yams, pumpkins, squash, brown rice, rice. Notice a starch that I left out? Corn. Corn in an unprocessed form is virtual indigestible by humans. Dymatize Elite Mass High-protein muscle gainer primary carbohydrate source is Maltodextrin. *“Maltodextrin can be enzymatically derived from any starch. In the US, this starch is usually corn” This product’s Supplement Facts list 75g of Total Carbohydrate 8g as Sugars. Maltodextrin a heavily processed corn product that while technical not a sugar it is processed very similar to sugar. *“Maltodextrin is easily digestible, being absorbed as rapidly as glucose”. Taking Dymatize Elite Mass High-protein muscle gainer before your work out is going to cause a sharp insulin response during your work out which is not what you want. This product is meant to be taken after a workout not before. To answer your question about “what else should I consume to maximize my gains?” 

You can't target specific areas of the body for weight loss. You need steady weight loss, and it'll come off your intended area at some point. For workouts, if you aim at losing weight, the obvious choice is to burn it off by doing cardio. What you should do in the gym(or out of it) is up to you: Do you like running, cycling, rowing? Then target those machines. As a vegan you should focus on your macros(proportion of protein,carbs and healthy fats). Vegan food can be carb heavy and lack protein(which saturates a bit - and is therefore good for weight loss). You need to learn which vegan foods are good in protein(green beans for example) and ramp it up there. 

It's quite normal to feel "weak" on a ketogenic diet, at least compared to one with a normal amount of carbs in it. You need energy from either fat or carbs. Fat is stored for longer and the energy "lasts" longer(but spikes less), whereas carbs spike quite fast and drop off more steeply. From the sound of it, perhaps you aren't getting enough good fats in your diet? What I used to do when I did keto + running was to eat a good handful of nuts about an hour before I went out to run. It helped greatly. Same thing with certain fruits that aren't that bad in carbs(like a pear or an apple) to also get the spike from fruitsugar helped me. 

I do not think you should drop the weights down and “focusing on really opening my hips up.” As long as you are not bowing the knees in to much I believe that this is somewhat of a natural progression once someone move beyond being a novice and really has to grind and work for every pound. Bowing the knees in slightly help you get out of the hole (the bottom of the squat.) This video was made by one of the strongest people on the plant and he talks about the very issue that this question is in regards to. $URL$ 

Welcome back to Leg workouts. Especially among former athletes and former lifters who take some time off it is extremely easy to overdo your first few (leg) workouts. After about 10 workouts you will notice that this post workout suffering will be much more manageable. Some ideas Hot and Cold Tubs right after a workout will help out greatly Prescription and Over the Counter drugs may help in the short term. 

Traditional indian diet means carb-loaded with a lack of protein, at least from what I've experienced of Indian cuisine. Your macros are likely not good with such a diet. You have to adapt. It's 90% diet and 10% what you do in the gym. 

Unless you get proper coaching and feedback on technique, no. You will develop bad habits and likely hurt your hands/wrists by doing improper technique while working the bag. Hand wrap technique and proper gloves as well as boxing basics are needed, otherwise you have a high chance of hurting yourself. 

As a new person to fitness, forget about it. Yes running 20-40km in one session might deplete your levels and burn off muscle, but for most people, this doesn't apply at all. 

All the supplements in the world won't fix a bad diet. You're underweight because you're eating too little. You need to eat more. To put on lean mass, stick to having good macro proportions of protein, carbs and healthy fats, and eat at a caloric surplus. And no, you do not have "fast metabolism" nor anything else. You just eat too little, and some pills won't make the difference to that. 

Besides the obvious Eat, Sleep, and be healthy advice….. Weight Training my help you grow a little with the added production of hGH but the extra height would be negligible and it would be impossible to know. Growth Hormone Treatment is the only real option to affect your height. This is a big step as a specialized doctor needs to closely monitor the Hormone regiment. Given that you are (assumption) an otherwise health 20 year old I doubt if you could find a doctor willing to help you. 

Calf are a small enough muscle group that no matter how many times you work them you are not going to run into over training issue by working them. So work them as much as you want. I think the question that you want to ask is. I’m a novice lifter and I want bigger calves. Should I work my calves 3 times a week? Can’t hurt might not help. It might sound like rhetoric but the squat is king. Squat heavy ass weights, sleep plenty as night and eat a calorie surplus. 

The boxing world - especially in the era where the "Rocky" movies were made - is notoriously bad at developing new methods for nutrition and exercise based on research and findings. The whole "drink raw eggs, run 5 miles every morning and beat this frozen pig"-method isn't really something you should strive for today. 

You can do a lot of core exercises on these. Examples: Pullups/chinups on the high bar. On the two low parallel bars, you can do different variants of dips. Usually, there'll be a very low bar to lock on your feet - so you can do situps. And the ground layer is soft and nice(but firm), making it really good for pushups(rather than on concrete). Nothing too fancy, no. But a good amount of core bodyweight drills can be conducted with that setup :-) 

Your diet is like 85% carbs. I mean yeah you can gain weight like that, but it's just fat and bloat. From your diet, I take it that you're indian. Indian cuisine(it's a big country, I know) is generally terrible for your health since it's carb-based either on rice or some kind of bread(like chapati, as you eat quite a bit of). Your protein intake is slim to none; a little from the veggies and milk, but it is perhaps 5-10% of your intake whereas it should be 30-40% if you want to build somewhat lean mass. 

Definition comes from lowering your Body fat. Chalking up my hands and doing heavy Deadlifting has given me more strength in my forearms than any isolated movement. 

I would pick one sugar or caffeine. It is much more likely that you will fail if you if try to quit both at the same time. To address the question of reducing the craving. 

I have dealt with this exact same injury (on the left side). I stopped doing all squats and dead-lifts for 2 month and waited for it to be back to 100%. Berin answer is spot on from my experience. During the 2 month hiatuses I focused on chest supported rowing, (non-chest supported rowing like bent rows caused a similar pain to squatting) LAT pulls, chin up, and more abdominal work. I used the 2 month to focus on my overhead lifts and made more gains in the 2 month than the previous 6. 

Chirstopher’s answer is great. I will just add a couple of my thoughts. Something that might be holding you back are muscle groups other than your shoulders and triceps. Core strength – is your core strong enough that that you don’t shake or wiggle around when overhead pressing. Back strength –a common muscle imbalance that I see in lifters is that the pressing (bench / overhead) is much stronger than there pulling (rows, pull-up, chin ups.) This can be caused by the muscle imbalances inherent in all new lifters and the over emphasis on the pressing exercises. This will limit your ability to control the weight when it is over your head. 

Unless you get a dexa scan or similar things conducted, bodyfat measure is at best something that can be done with, i dont know, a 5-10% deviation. You are likely not sub-10% bodyfat or even remotely close given your own description of your stomach. Either that, or you abs are widely underdeveloped. 

Recently(3 months) joined gym, I am following diet and doing workout (mostly cardio). Till date i have lost 5-6 kg(85kg before), mainly following diet. That's decent weight loss and progress. Keep it up? Does i have injured my knee forever? Don't know. Go see a doctor. Also i have query whether i first lose weight then gain muscle or both goes hand in hand? Generally, you'd have periods of "cutting"(losing weight) and "bulking"(gaining weight). With the first, you aim at a calorie deficit, however not too big(because then you will lose muscle). On the second, you aim at a calorie surplus with a good macro balance(proportion of protein, good carbs and healthy fats) 

Are you truly injured? If you are get better and then get back to lifting. Otherwise. Should I reset my weights for a month? No, not if you are following the plan in starting strength. I have read starting strength and it says nothing about a novice lifter de-loading for a month to practice your form. If you are only 2 month into a progressive overload regimented and you are not getting stronger every work out you need to look at your sleep, food, and hydration. If you get your 3x5 on the bench press at 115lb what weight are you doing next session? 120lb or 125lb. That would be a huge jump. In starting strength they would advocate moving up by 2lb. Does your gym have 1lb weights? Use them. If not wedge some 1lb dumbbells that the aerobic classes use under the clips or go to Walmart and buy 2 1lb dumbbells and bring them to the gym with you. Don’t get ahead of yourself. Putting 5lb on your lifts a month is good progress. 

Do both, and see what you enjoy? Something inbetween could be doing a bodyweight workout before/after running and incorporate both. Just remember to start slow. 

My answer to you comes as an amateur boxer who has done both training to cut down body fat percentage, but also training to get in better shape to perform HIIT(which a boxing fight essentially is). would like to know the difference between cardio workout and fat burn workout. What is preferable in which case of training? Fat burn workout will have you working consistently over a longer time, but at a lower heartrate. It works the aerobic system which should burn fat. For example, if I want to lower my bodyfat percentage, I'll do long runs of maybe 10-12km every other day, at a steady pace(but quite slow, at least for me). On the other hand, cardio workouts are the opposite - you have a high heart rate and therefore work on the anaerobic system. This can be interval training(i.e. sprint 100m, jog very lightly next 100m, then spring next 100m), constantly pushing your heartrate to the maximum and calming down afterwards. Anaerobic exercises are so short in bursts that they do not per se burn fat, but rather carbs. Which is why, for example, a ketogenic diet is a nightmare for anyone doing sports that include HIIT exercises - you simply gas out almost instantly. To answer your question - if you want to burn fat, do aerobic exercises(long workouts at low heartrate). If you wanna improve anaerobic capability(HIIT capability), you do short bursts of intervals - it could be rowing, running, boxing.. Anything, really. And if it is preferable for someone with low body fat trying to build muscles Not that relevant, this is for conditioning purposes mostly. Muscle comes from either weight training or bodyweight exercises. Either aerobic or anaerobic training can support both. Depends on your end-goal.
