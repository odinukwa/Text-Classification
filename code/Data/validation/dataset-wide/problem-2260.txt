I have a rather nice 1-2 person hiking tent from over 20 years ago. It's still made, with very few changes, and is a double wall design that pitches in one go. I thought it was nylon but the current model is polyester; it's certainly synthetic. It was put away clean and dry some years ago, tightly wrapped in plastic and stored in an unheated loft. I expected to use it again soon but never did. Now I need a light tent again, I want to see if this one is still useful. I can pitch it in the garden, but what should I do to make sure it's OK? 

For walking on rough terrain and scrambling in hot conditions I've found hiking shoes or approach shoes to work very well. That is after all what they're meant for. They're a bit tougher and heavier than trainers, and I suspect that the ones you had were essentially trainers styled like walking shoes (despite the label; I've had some like that from shoe shops). I've had a couple of brands. The more expensive ones had exactly the same sole as a pair of hiking boots I also have, but cut lower at the ankle (KSB). I've had a few pairs, over the last 25 years, of a cheaper brand (HiTec) that happens to fit me very well. The KSBs and most of the HiTecs have been waterproof/breathable. Brand is less important than fit and sole quality. You probably need a proper outdoor shop, but the shoes you're sheet should be among the cheaper ones they sell. Most outdoor shops these days have a test ramp, a steep slope with climbing wall holds attached. Most will also be able to offer advice. Your budget seems perfectly sensible with UK pricing. 

It's certainly possible in North Wales, one was reported near Mold a couple of weeks ago and they're quite mobile at this time of year. I don't think you can rule out common buzzard for several reasons: 

Sock weight can be used for fine tuning even once you've bought the boots but these two points are critical. You may find that the "better" socks (with padded weight-bearing sections) are worse for you than cheaper hiking socks with a uniform weight. For the distances I do these days it doesn't matter very much but on multi-day trips (assuming it wasn't too hot) I always chose to go for two pairs: one thin "normal" pair and one thinnish hiking pair with padded sections. A good fit is by far the best way to avoid blisters, and ankle protection comes from the boot not the sock - again a good fit will optimise this. The only note of caution I'll sound is don't overcommit if you make significant changes. Just like you wouldn't set off on a long day's hike in new boots, either carry the socks to go back to your old system at the first sign of discomfort, or break your feet in gradually. This is expecially true if switching to something that's more likely to rub. You may also find changing your laces/lacing pattern helps by allowing you to lace the boot tighter in some places than others. 

You might also consider a Z-Rest, which greatly improves on the warmth of a foam mat. It also solves the problem of condensation under your mat, which afflicts both air and foam mats, by the "egg-crate" design allowing some airflow under the mat. Like other foam mats though, it is still bulky. 

I haven't climbed for a long time - not since uni. Our climbing club was famous for its training though, so people from other clubs often joined us for the workout, and a fair number continued to actually doing some climbing. Having belayed a few people much heavier than me (rugby players!), my main caveat is that your belayer needs to be cautious about your relative weights. This isn't an issue if belaying from above - in that case the belayer is clipped in, and all is good. Belaying from below though, whether that's with a top-rope or seconding, they need to be aware that if you come off, they're going to be heading up at speed! With a climber significantly heavier than yourself, it's best to treat it similarly to belaying from above. Find something behind you to put a sling round, clip the sling to your belay device (not to the back of your harness!), and you're safe. It doesn't need the same security that belaying from above does, because it's only there to catch the difference in weights, but it's still pretty important. Your belayer may not have thought of this, because they're too used to catching similarly-sized gym rats. It's sensible for you to check this, just in case. It doesn't matter how strong they are or how good their technique is, gravity is gravity, and once their feet leave the ground it's Sir Isaac who decides the outcome. 

I have similar problems with an inflatable mat. With a foam mat, even if it gives slightly under pressure locations, you're still insulated. With an inflatable mat, any pressure location has a good chance of going straight through the mat and touching the ground - and at that point of course you have no insulation at all. For myself, I combine a Z-Lite underneath and a regular 8mm foam mat on top. The Z-Lite ensures you are well away from the ground, and the foam mat stops you sinking into the Z-Lite (the "egg crate" effect can be uncomfortable). The extra weight is negligible, and the end result is a perfectly-comfortable and perfectly-insulated night's sleep. The Z-Lite is also the best thing ever invented if you're camping on rough/lumpy ground - effectively there isn't competition, because everything else isn't even in the same race. And for bonus points, the Z-Lite also allows some airflow around the tent floor underneath you, so the normal problem with condensation building up under your mat doesn't happen. 

For one day a phone will do it. Most android phones allow GPS in flight mode and there are plenty of apps that will log tracks offline (I use one called IPbike as a bike computer with data and WiFi turned off, for example). Some allow you to select how often to get your position, to save battery. An alternative is an old non-mapping GPS. I've got an old etrex that does about 20 hours off a decent set of alkaline batteries. It records tracks (but you need a serial port to get them onto a PC). For navigating you would need to use it with a map, though it can display a route for you to follow, and a bearing to the next waypoint 

I have a mapcase made of clear plastic (PVC I think). It has a roll top held shut with velcro. Both sides of the velcro were attached by some sort of welding process but one of them has completely come off. I've tried reattaching it with hot glue, which seemed OK at first, but didn't survive one use. I've tried pressing the plastic to the backing of the velcro with a heated tool, but despite the hot plastic smell there was no adhesion. Not only is it my most waterproof mapcase, ideal for inkjet-printed maps in the rain, but it attaches to the handlebar bag of my bike. Replacements don't seem to be available, and it's perfect for riding to a hike, something I quite like to do. But with the velcro missing the maps simply fall out (it's at the bottom). I don't want to sew through the plastic unless I absolutely have to: it will breach the waterproof section, and I don't appear to have anything that I could use to seal the holes. 

I suggest you don't need a tent and a tarp, unless the latter is also to be worn as a poncho (unless I've missed them you don't mention waterproofs). Similarly you don't need a head torch and a torch, or a lighter and matches and a flint. But neither of these will make much difference. That load is similar to what I carried years ago for a few days between food sources, though we had more access to water. It's not an unreasonable total, though there are plenty of people who successfully carry much less. If you're with others, some items can be shared, which makes a big difference. What's important with that sort of weight is that you pack correctly. This means packing first for balance with access to particular items of secondary importance. The heaviest items should be low and close to you. As much weight as possible should be carried on your hips, and the load shouldn't swing around as you walk. All this will avoid the need you feel to lean towards for balance. It will still feel odd at first if you're not used to carrying a pack, and even that assumes the pack fits properly. Assuming you're already used to day hikes, you could try some hut-to-hut trips or youth hostelling as an interim step. That way you won't need the tent or so much water. 

Comments from Aaron and StrongBad suggest this may be a country-specific thing, in particular due to being further from civilisation, and perhaps with greater public access to guns. In the UK, every walker, without exception, will talk to other walkers. To fail to say "hi" as you pass is deeply rude - and in places accessible with transport (such as the top of Snowdon) where you'll get keen walkers and day-trippers together, people blanking you is the clearest sign of whether they're walkers or they just got up there on the train. (Unsuitable footwear too, of course! :) And if you pause at a natural stopping point - a stile or trig point, say - and another walker coming past asks you where you've come from and where you're heading, again it would be seen as unusually rude to just blank them. You don't have to tell them your life story, or your full plans for the day or the next week. Partly it could be out of genuine curiosity. But partly it's a human interaction thing though. The person asking is simply acknowledging that you both have a shared interest, and that shared interest gives a common topic of conversation which otherwise you would not have. Sure, you could both talk about the weather (and that's why Brits talk about the weather - it's about the only safe shared experience we all have as a conversation opener), but you're both doing something you both enjoy, so why not chat about it briefly while you both get your breath, then move off again? I've done a lot of walking, and I rarely find people wanting to use this to show off. Show-offs don't tend to survive (often literally!) in the hills. Where you're going is purely factual. If someone is setting themselves a hard day's walking, you don't think they're boasting, you wish them luck. And if they've just got a short distance today, you say "you lucky sod, you'll be in the pub before me then". If you think they're showing off and they won't make it, you still wish them well, knowing privately that they're going to be suffering around mid-afternoon. (You can generally tell "all-the-gear-but-no-idea" folk by their pristine kit.) Mostly you won't be going in the same direction as the other person. If you're doing a long distance walk though (especially if it's a defined route), the chances are very good that you'll meet the same people as you go. Maybe you'll overtake them during the day, or they'll overtake you, or you'll just see the same people at the campsites or huts in the evenings. If you blank them during the day, things are going to be pretty damn awkward in the evening. Be human. Interact. You may not know these people from Adam, and you may never see them again in your life - but be sure that any of these other walkers will risk their neck for you if they find you in trouble.
