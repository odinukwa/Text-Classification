At the present time the only thing that allows us to believe the nonexistence of closed timelike curves are the immensely successful experimental verifications of the laws of relativity, including the speed of light being a universal speed limit, as well as the cosmological data that rejects the idea that our universe conforms to the one described by Gödel and other similar metrics. The philosophical weight of such timetravel paradoxes as the grandfather paradox add extra impetus for our belief that time travel is not possible. However, of course, that is not a formal proof that they do not exist. Additionally there is another credibly theory of time travel that deserves attention. This is of course the existence of Einstein-Rosen bridges (wormholes). There is a lot of treatment of wormholes in the current scientific literature and it has been well understood since Einstein and Rosen's original 1935 paper that wormholes that arise under "normal" conditions are non-traversable. This means that a particle cannot go entirely through the wormhole and come out on the other side. To understand why this is the case you should read more about Penrose diagrams of a Schwarzschild blackhole. It is true that wormholes may be made traversable but the conditions for them to be are very unlikely to exist naturally in the universe and many physicists believe it is not possible for us to create them given our current understanding of what exists in the universe. Conclusion Given our current metaphysical stances on time, as outlined above, the answer to time travel lies in empirical experiment. There is enough room in the solely logical aspects of the question to allow for both answers (as demonstrated in the IEP and SEP articles linked above) and the metaphysical interpretations point us towards empirical experiments to find the answer. The current understanding in our best physical theories is that time travel is allowed by general relativity, however it is unlikely that our universe contains the structure to support closed timelike curves and traversable wormholes. 

Think of the difference between the first few words. "Industry" is a noun that means the process of manufacturing goods. "Industrial" is an adjective that describes something as being related to industry. "Industrialize" is a verb that means to make something industrial. "Industrialization" is a noun that describes something in the process of being industrialized. "Industrializational" is an adjective that describes something as being related to industrialization. "Industrializationalize" is a verb that means to make something industrializational. "Industrializationalization" is a noun that ... As you can see, although the concepts that we are describing are becoming much more complex each time we add a morpheme to the end, there is still an idea that is being conveyed by the words. This process could go on for as long as you feel the need to write down these words and all of the resulting words would still have meaning, albeit very abstract meanings. There is a pattern to take away from this. Notice that in each of the new words, the new ending is modifying the word that proceeded it. "Industrialization" uses the morpheme "ation" to modify "industrial" which came before it. "Industrializationalizational" uses the morpheme "al" to modify "Industrializationalization" which comes before it on the recursive chain. So we can apply this sort of recursive backtracking to the example you gave. Let's take the definition of "unaware" to mean "a lack of knowledge" in this case. 

Plato's Forms are supposedly abstract objects that do not exist in the same sort of space and time that we ourselves do. It then becomes very apparent to ask "okay, then how do we have knowledge of the forms?" This line of reasoning has been explored by many philosophers (including Plato himself) and is considered by some to be the strongest argument against platonism. The argument has been articulated in "Mathematical Truth" by Paul Benacerraf and "Realism, Mathematics, and Modality" by Hartry Field. From the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosohpy's article on Platonism in Metaphysics: 

In terms of the identity of a material object, philosophers would argue that a transgender person has the same identity as before. From the SEP's article on Identity: 

Propositional logic deals with propositions and it has an infinite amount of variables to represent those propositions. A theory in propositional logic is a specific set of sentences in the language, meaning they use the symbols in the syntactically correct way. The initial sentences that you list are the axioms of the theory and you use the deductive rules (rules of inference) to create more sentences. Natural deduction is a specific system to apply those rules of inference in that can be applied to different logical systems. A statement in propositional logic might look something like ((A → B) → C). A and B are propositions, they have truth values, and the arrow is the implication connective. We could decide to make a logical theory, we can call it T, that has this as an axiom. We then use the rules of inference to derive new sentences, which are called theorems. The process looks like this: 

The first fallacy is an example of "examining the person instead of their argument" because it makes an appeal to the authority of somebody without actually analyzing the words they are saying. An example would be a chemist telling you that hydrogen bonds are an example of covalent bonding. This is false and believing the chemist purely based off of their status as a chemist would be fallacious. The truth of the statement is not determined by the person's job or education level; the truth of the statement is determined by the facts of the situation. This means you should not evaluate them as a person, instead you should evaluate their words (their argument). The second fallacy is an support of the proverb because it makes an appeal to popular consensus. For this example, imagine that the year is 300 B.C.E. The example would be: "many people believe that the Sun orbits the Earth, therefore the Sun orbits the Earth." This is a fallacy because it is an appeal to the amount of people that believe a statement instead of the actual facts relating to the statement. The reasoning goes like this: Many people believe this, it would be improbably for a large amount of people to believe something false, therefore it must be true. You can see that this argument has nothing to do with the actual statement, it is merely an appeal to the large amount of people that believe it. It supports the proverb because it shows the fallacious nature of only looking at the amount of people speaking and not at their actual words. Finally, the third fallacy supports the proverb because it shows the irrelevance of attacking a person instead of their argument. Suppose that Alice and Bob are having a discussion about which flavor of ice cream is the best and Alice says chocolate. If Bob then replies "Well, you voted for Nixon so what do you know?" that would be an example of an ad hominem fallacy. The truth, or merit, of whether or not chocolate is the best ice cream has nothing to do with whom Alice voted for. Bob is trying to show that Alice's opinion cannot be trusted because she made a poor decision in the past but, again, this is irrelevant to the topic at hand. It is not impossible for someone who showed poor judgement once to show good judgement later and whom Alice voted for has nothing to do with the qualitative values of flavors of ice cream.
