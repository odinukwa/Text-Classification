It depends on your existing muscle tone, but given that you will have body weight and cardio training, it may even improve. Also, given the overall picture of serving the 2 year minimum time in the US Navy US Navy Committment, the availability of weightlifting for the other 95 weeks should be more important for you. 

The "notebook & pen" is great from a "in use" perspective. As John says, the notebook or - as I prefer - index cards do better in the gym than smartphone/tablets. Both for the training program itself and for taking notes on weights, reps and effort. However, for the other perspective, when you capture the context (sleep, food, subjective info) and want to analyze the training, I find the "Excel" like solutions to be superior. Combining the two in a seamless way is difficult. My own solution is to capture the context in a Google spreadsheet combined with Google Forms and a dashboard, see below 

To be very precise with your tempo, one suggestion would be to use this tempo trainer or a metronome app. You can set them for different tempos which makes the counting easier. 

Run with shorter, slower steps & be prepared for slipping. Most that I saw running on the Sunday had special shoes, e.g. Icebug and they ran slower and with shorter steps. Shorter & also means less effort -> less intense breathing. Clothing, same as cross country skiing, see REI. That is, layering, ready for being really warm at the core, but protecting sensitive areas such as head, hands etc. Avoid to shave or wash your face in the morning before the run, it helps to protect your face (see the Swedish national health guide) from frost bites. 

I have found these exercises helpful for increasing mobility, see MAQ complex. Besides helping mobilty, they also work as warm-up exercise. 

So if you create a matrix of Sleep time {too little (less than 6-7 hours), right amount (6-7 hours), too much (9-10 hours)} and Exercise {no exercise, light exercise, heavy exercise} and map it too {+, -}, it seems reasonable that you should sleep 1-2 hours extra after a heavy workout. My own experience is that I have sometimes difficulties to sleep after hard workouts late at the day. So the question might also be related to when at the day you exercise. 

Almost all training programs or workout routines are focused on the very short term, e.g. 90 days, 12 weeks and similar. My questions is about the "kernel" (key elements in a wide sense) for a training program that can work throughout at least half of an expected life time for most people in the developed world. A long term training program that manages the changes in care taking situations (children, ageing parents), injuries (permanent, temporary, ..), physical capability, income, moving to different countries/regions and work situations. On Google Scholar, it seems like the topic "lifelong physical training" generates interesting results, see "life long physical training". Habits seems to be important for people to maintain long training programs. See for example, "Physical activity and muscle training in the elderly." a 20 year study on male "orienterare". However, I know many in that sport that have changed to other sports or - in most cases - stopped training. On the commercial side, there are a number of gyms in the US that promises "life long fitness" but their methods seem to be the same as other gyms 

My tracking for fitness is currently based on a 28 day (4 weeks) time window. For example, my goal is to have 3 high intensity exercises per week which means that over the four weeks, it should be 12. The same is for all kind of physical exercise (walks, longer bike trips etc.), recovery exericses (yoga, etc.). See the dashboard below: 

Ratio of work to rest. The 2:1 isn't typical for all sorts of HIIT. The Wikipedia article in the source also mentions the "Little method" where you have more of a 1:1 relationship. Personally, I have been exposed to "2 min run - 2 min rest"x10 or "15s run-15s rest" x10x2 protocols, depending on goals and where you are in a yearly training cycle. Besides increasing VO2max, HIIT can also be used to practice "game"/"real" situations. Some strength training work-out routines, e.g. "New rules of Lifting", have for variation purposes work outs with weights where the weights are relatively heavy (deadlift, squats, lunges) and the rest periods short. If you execute these and measure your pulse, you will see that you get close to a HIIT session. Consulting a doctor first is a must, I would also recommend a pulse watch. For beginners so that they during the work out, work hard enough and for formerly active and now aged, so that they don't get carried away and die from cardiac arrest. 

Overcoming fear in general when training is personal. Doing things gradually more challenging works for me. Specifics with swimming is related to breathing. Waves, cooler water, noise, a new wetsuit and obstacles (sea grass, frogs, snakes, other swimmers at the start of a race) in the water are all factors that can throw your breathing off-balance and cause you to hold your breath and thus not exhaling enough. Not exhaling increases the level of CO2 which in its turn increases the feeling of anxiety and even panic. And more anxiety makes you more sensitive to the factors which then impacts your breathing, i.e. it is easy to fall in a vicious circle in open water swimming. What to do? Here is a short mental program (similar to other recommendations e.g. swimsmooth): Detect that you are about to fall in the vicious circle. For a few strokes (e.g. 5-6): 

The pulsmeter market is very big with a few global brands (Polar, Garmin, Suunto) and lots of local brands. I have been using Suunto for 5 years now, both a "R to R" recording belt and a watch for feeback during the actual practise. If you are about to buy one, here are some simple checks regarding service and maintenace: 

... It seems like there is a negative correlation between height and BMI, i.e. the shorter you are the higher BMI, note that this is a limited amount of data, so the uncertainty is high. However, if you give me the data of a larger sample {name, height, weight}, , use this link data entry and I will recalculate it for you :-). Following the model below, your BMI should be 23, which means a weight of 60kg. 

Yes, there is a difference. For example, in the this lecture, sleep scientist Jessica Payne from University of Notre Dame talks about the importance of sleep in the context of fitness (not only fitness). Sleep is different from just inactivity, see for example the wikipedia article on the topic. In contrast to rest, during sleep the body grows and repairs itself and the brain builds new neural connection much more than when you are awake, which are key to improve physical fitness. On a personal level, I have started to track sleep as well as workouts and to me it is clear how it impacts how hard I can/should practise and how likely I am to catch a cold. I.e. if I know I will sleep little (travel etc) -> plan to do high intensity training another day. As an example, here is my sleep data for the last 28 days is included. After the night with very little sleep (a long flight), I only focused on very light training (walk/yoga). 

Besides plyometric and dragging, I would also work on reaction speed exercises. For example, lay on the ground, wait for a signal, get up and sprint shorter distances. The reason is that your goal is to use the sprint in a team sport context where reaction speed is important. Typical reaction & sprint drills from basketball (where the distance is related to the lenght of a basketball court) would be: 

I did the 100 pushups last summer and I had the same experience as you describe in your question. I continued with the plan and didn't add any extra exercises for the abs. After a few weeks, the soreness disappeared. 

Given that you seem to be very experienced in the field, i.e. know all the technical aspects of the situations back and forth, and assuming that you are fit, it might make sense to focus on meditation. Over time, meditation can help you with of seeing the situation as it really is and that might be better for reaction speed and timing than basing the reaction pattern on a specific cue. I did a search at Google Scholar, see Google Scholar: meditation and reaction time and - for example - Effect of buddhist meditation on.... seems to support this. My own experience from playing basketball is that I was more likely to get into a "flow" state (i.e. where your opponents seems to be in slow motion) if I have had the possibility to meditate before the games. Besides meditating before home games, I did it 15-20 minutes twice a day, just based on reading about it, not following any particular meditation school. 

If you have been away for a long period from a team sport, you should try to practise as similar to the sport as possible. Your situational awareness will not be as it was 7 years ago. So the first thing that can be improved in your program is to add hurling like drills and play (e.g. interval running instead of steady state tread mills, change of direction, reaction drills, watching games, recording & watching your own moves). Second, your weight lifting seems to have a lot of isolated drills, I would go for more basic exercises such as dead lift, squats, press with barbells, no machines. See Starting Strength for reasoning on the importance for these drills in team sports with body contact. Especially the reasoning around "google: posterior chain" Third, to fit it all in to a normal, non elite athlete life, I would reduce the number of training days to maybe 3 per week (1-2 hurling like cardio or 2-1 weight lifting) and trying to get in actual hurling play 1-2 times per week (e.g. play on smaller fields with fewer players if that is possible). 

I think you should listen to your panic signals. If your only are three months into the program, what is the hurry? A serious injury will reduce whatever training effect your are aiming for much more than advancing too quickly. Based on the options you presented in your question, I would go for getting a training partner AND listening to the excellent specific advice from Berin around the racks and techniques. 

One tool that can help you to control the frequency of your strokes is a tempo trainer. Controlling the frequency would let you to gradually increase it until you reach a point where you feel that the technique fails. E.g swim 50m with a time between strokes of 1:25. If you that the technique is ok, decrease it to 1:15, swim 50m, etc Once you find a frequency that works for a short distance, increase the distance for the interval. 

Yoga can - among other things - improve your flexibility, for example, see this article in YogaJournal. The article argues that yoga both addresses the physical side of flexibility (muscle, ligaments, joints etc) and the neuro system part of flexibility. My own experience of yoga is that is has helped me to be more flexible(for example, no problems with third world squat now, big problems before), better balance (for example, no knee problems any longer when down hill skiing) and more aware of posture (less problems with my back). To get started, find a yoga "dojo" that fits your style/perspective and take some classes regularly for a few months. For me, I liked the ones that focus on the physical side better than the ones focusing on the spiritual side. Yoga is then quite easy to integrate in daily training routines and also a way of "going to gym" training that is easy to bring your spouse too. For example, you could do a short yoga routine as a warm-up for both your Body weight routing and your Running routine. 

Screen shot from Wolfram Alpha 2013-01-13 So if you really want to run, here are some additional things to consider: 

Warm-ups are always good, both for the physical and the mental side of training. To give an example of a warm up exercise with some structure in it, I can recommend "sun salutations" from yoga. For the last couple years, I have used them as my standard warm-up tool for both body weight and other exercises. 

I faced the same challenge about 2 1/2 years ago. That is, no swimming background but wanted to try open water swimming. Based on my own trial and error path, I would recommend the following: 

Rope jumping is a great coordination and conditioning exercise. Here is my take at your parameters (based on countless hours of it..) Material. As light and thin as possible, that is nylon or leather. Leather is nice but more expensive. Length. there are a number of methods for finding the correct length. E.g. stand on the rope, pull the handles towards your armpits, for experienced it should be a little below, for inexperienced a little bit higher, see this Google: correct length for a jump rope. My method is to hold the handles, straighten the arms outwards to the sides, if the rope is a bit above my knees, it is right for me. Weighted grip. I agree with your own analysis, that is, not a must. Ball bearings. Good to have for faster spinning. Indoor vs outdoor. Should not be a factor. You can use the same for both. 

First Beat (see White papers) has a concept they call "Training Effect" that guides your training based on the history of the last couple of months and your last traning (besides weight, age, sex,..) In their system, fitness is measured through two parameters: Activity Class and Training level. Both are based on the activity for the last couple of months and they are used to determine how hard you should train for the next couple of weeks. I have been using it for the last 5 years and it has helped me to train at the right level of effort. My main issue before the using the system was that I trained too hard and got injured. A drawback of the system is that it always tries to guide you to higher training levels, I would like it to have an explicit "maintenance mood" since I want to vary my training over the seasons (harder in the spring/summer, easier in the fall/winter). 

In order to track I have used Funbeat. The site has an Android app that tracks running but not general motion in the way a Fitbit (and similar does). I could not find an app that does the Fitbit stuff in the Google Play store, I searched for "android app step counter" Besides tracking, I think it is useful to have a planning tool. For guidance and variation on intensity, I have use the Athlete software from Firstbeat since 2007, you don't need any pulse meters do use it (pulse can be entered manually for workouts). For me, the Firstbeat software was great from stopping me to train too hard (I was stuck in the "no pain - no gain" loop since my earlier training activities, not good when you become middle aged). 

I did a search on Google Scholar "best time of day to exercise", the most relevant article seems to be Time of day and exercise. In short, you seem to perform a little better in the afternoon. My own experience regarding high intensity training is that 1) it is needed in a all round training program, so sometimes you have to do it in the morning to meet all other requirements. 2) If I can choose, I try do them on the weekend afternoons.
