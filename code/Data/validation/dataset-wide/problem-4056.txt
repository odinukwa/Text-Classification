The symmetric group on $n$ letters has many sets of generators. Some of them are more natural than others, eg the set $(i,i+1)$ of adjacent transpositions (natural with respect to the type A Weyl group), the set of all shuffles (permutations corresponding to "card-shuffles", ie $\sigma(1),\sigma(2),\dots,$ contains at most two increasing subsequences) perhaps also sets consisting of conjugacy classes (preferably of signature $-1$ in order to avoid a stupid mistake). Which other sets of generators of symmetric groups occur in a natural way? 

Does every set of $n$ points in the Euclidean plane contain three points $A,B,C$ such that the two segments obtained by joining $A,B$, respectively $A,C$ form an angle at least equal to $(1-2/n)\pi$ at the point $A$? (Equality is of course achieved by the vertex set of a regular $n-$gone.) Pietro Majer's example below can be generalized and shows that $(1-2/n)\pi$ has to be replaced by a somewhat smaller constant (at least for values of $n$ which are large enough). For his example we have to take $(1-2/6)\pi$ instead of $(1-2/7)\pi$. Is the best possible constant $(1-a(n))\pi$ asymptotically substantially better, ie. can $na(n)$ become for example arbitrarily large for $n$ large enough? (It is of course obvious that $a(n)$ is decreasing but how fast?) Update: For $n=5$, one can get arbitrarily close to $(1-1/4)\pi$: Take a right-angled isocele triangle. Split the right-angled-vertex infinitesimally along a line parallel to the longest side of the initial triangle and add an additional point on the symmetry axis very high above the two infinitesimal points. 

Given a finite tree $T$ with $n$ vertices labelled $1,\dots,n$, we say that a permutation $\sigma$ of $1,\dots,n$ rips all edges if $\{\sigma(i),\sigma(j)\}$ is never an edge for every edge $\{i,j\}$ of $T$. It is easy to see that every tree of diameter at least $3$ has such permutations. They are not very hard to count (see A2464 of the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences) for Dynkin diagrams of type $A$ (with edges given by $\{i,i+1\}$ for $i=1,\dots,n-1$). Can they be counted similarly in polynomial time for an arbitrary tree of diameter $\geq 3$? More generally, can one compute efficiently the ripping polynomial $R(T)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\alpha_k t^k$ which counts numbers $\alpha_k$ of permutations preserving exactly $k$ edges of $T$? This is again easy for Dynkin diagrams of type $A$ with $R(n)$ defined by \begin{eqnarray*} R(n)&=&A(n)+tB(n),\\ A(1)&=&1,\\ A(n+1)&=&(1-t)A'(n)+(n-2)A(n)+t(1-t)B'(n)+t(n-2)B(n),\\ B(1)&=&0,\\ B(n+1)&=&(1+t)B(n)+2A(n). \end{eqnarray*} The picture obtained by plotting all complex roots (for $n\sim 100$) might be slightly unsuitable for a general audience. Interestingly, we have $R'(n)=2(n-1)(n-1)!$ showing that the mean number of non-ripped edges by a random permutation equals $2-\frac{2}{n}$. Added: The polynomials $C(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\gamma_kt^k$ defined by $R(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (n-k)!\gamma_kt^k$ (with $R$ as above attached to the Dynkin diagram of type $A$ with $n$ vertices) are also somewhat interesting since they satisfy the recursion relation $C(n+1)=(1+t)C(n)+tC(n-1)$ (initial values are $C(1)=1,C(2)=1+2t$). On can of course generalise the above questions to arbitrary graphs (answers are obvious for complete graphs for example). 

Not an answer but a reformulation of Sokoban in terms of oriented graphs: A Sokoban-problem of order $k$ on a finite directed graph with vertices $V$ and directed edges $E$ (with $(s,t)$ denoting an edge from $s$ to $t$) consists of two (perhaps intersecting) subsets $V_I,V_F$ of $k$ vertices (defining initial and final positions of the $k$ boxes), of a marked vertex $*$ of $V\setminus V_I$ and of a set $P=\cup_{e\in E}P_e$ of "possible pushes" where $P_e$ is a subset of edges starting at the final vertex $t$ of the oriented edge $e=(s,t)$. A Sokoban-problem is solved if $V_F=V_I$. A move consists either by a choice of a new marked vertex $*'\in V\setminus V_I$ adjacent to $*$ by an edge $(*,*')$ or by a choice of a new marked vertex $*'\in V_i$ adjacent to $*$ by an edge $(*,*')$ together with a new set $V'_I$ of initial vertices of the form $V'_I=(V_I\setminus\lbrace *'\rbrace)\cup \lbrace v\rbrace$ with $v\in V\setminus V_I$ such that $(*',v)$ is an element of the set $P_{(*,*')}$ of possible pushes associated to the oriented edge $(*,*')$. (The sets $V_F$ of final positions and $P$ of possible pushes remain the same.) The Sokoban-graph $(V,E,V_F,P)$ with possible moves $P$ and $k$ final positions $V_F$ is the directed graph with vertices given by all ${\sharp(V)\choose k}(\sharp(V)-k)$ possible choices of $k$ initial vertices $V_I$ and of a marked vertex $*$ in $V\setminus V_I$. Moves define oriented edges of the Sokoban-graph. A solution of a Sokoban problem $(V,E,V_I,V_F,*,P)$ is a path in the Sokoban-graph $(V,E,V_F,P)$ starting at the vertex $(V,E,V_I,V_F,*,P)$ and ending at one of the $(\sharp(V)-k)$ solutions $(V,E,V_F,V_I=V_F,*,P)$ (with $*\in V\setminus V_F$). The Sokoban graph $(V,E,V_F,P)$ has thus $<\sharp(V)^{k+1}$ vertices and it is of degree $\leq m^2$ where $m$ is the maximum over all in-degrees and out-degrees of $(V,E)$. I have the impression that this implies that a given concrete Sokoban problem can be solved in polynomial time (since $m\leq 4$ for Sokoban). 

Two (not necessarily convex) poygons of equal area are scissor-congruent, i.e. both can be cut along a finite number of straight lines or segments into isometric pieces. What can be said about the complexity of scissor congruence? Remarks: The number of cuts cannot be bounded in terms of the number of sides: A very thin triangle (of huge diameter) has to be cut into a large number of pieces if the other triangle has small diameter (e.g. is equilateral). However, the proof of scissor congruence shows that the number of cuts can be bounded if both polygons of area $1$ have bounded diameter $\leq A$ and a bounded number of sides $\leq N$. Is such a bound a linear function of $A$ and $N$? (The bound can only be slightly worse than linear, I believe.) What are the asymptotics of the optimal bound? (The question is still somewhat unprecise since there are several possibilities for counting the number of necessary cuts: one might allow cuts along segments or only along lines, two intersecting cuts can be counted as $2$ or $3$ cuts, etc.) Remark: One way to make the question precise, is to ask for the minimal number of pieces (this should not differ to much from the number of necessary cuts in generic situations). 

A set of $n$ points in the plane in generic position (no alignement of three points) has at least $2.012^n$ different triangulations of its convex hull involving only the set of given points.We call such a triangulation a checkerboard-triangulation if every interior vertex belongs to an even number of triangles (ie. triangles can be colored black-white with adjacent triangles being of different colours, equivalently, vertices of a checkerboard-triangulation can be coloured using only three different colours). A "random" set of $n$ points is certainly in generic position and the parity of the degree of a fixed vertex in such a triangulation should be "random", ie. even for about half of all possible triangulations. Assuming independence of parities of degrees of different vertices, one should thus expect the existence of checkerboard-triangulations for large random configurations of points. Otherwise stated, let $A_n$ be the number of combinatorially different sets of $n$ points in generic position (also called "order-types") and let $B_n$ be the number of such sets (up to combinatorial equivalence) which have a checkerboard-triangulation. Does $B_n/A_n$ tend to $1$? (Two configurations are combinatorially equivalent if they are isotopic in the set of generic configurations, endowed with the obvious topology). Warning: There are arbitrarily large generic sets of points with no checkerboard triangulation: Take $(x_i,y_i)$ with $x_1=-1<x_2<\dots<x_n=1$ and $y_i=x_i^2-1$ and add $(x_{n+1},y_{n+1})=(0,-2)$. Every triangulation is obtained by joining the first $n$ points $(x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_n,y_n)$ to the last point $(0,-2)$ and by triangulation the convex hull of the first $n$ points. This leads always to the existence of a point of odd degree among $(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_{n-1},y_{n-1})$. 

For $n$ a natural integer congruent to $7$ modulo $8$, one has seemingly always $$\sum_{k=1}^{(n-1)/2}\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)k=0$$ where $\left(\frac{k}{n}\right)$ denotes the Jacobi symbol. First cases: $n=7$: $1+2-3$ $n=15$: $1+2+4-7$ $n=23$: $1+2+3+4-5+6-7+8+9-10-11$ I do not see any reason for this. Did I miss something obvious? 

The symmetric group of an enumerable set contains every enumerable group as a subgroup. Its linearity would thus imply the linearity of every enumerable group which is false for example by the Tits's alternative. 

If $a=c=0$ and $b=d=1$, define $f$ by affine interpolation between $f(x+y,0)$ and $f(0,x+y)$ if $x+y\leq 1$ respectively $f(x+y-1,1)$ and $f(1,x+y-1)$ if $x+y\geq 1$. The general case can be reduced to the previous one by an affine transformation. 

I do not understand what your outgoing edges are but the number of undirected graphs with $N$ labeled vertices and average degree $d$ (which you call $z_1$ but $d$ seems more natural to me) is approximatively given by $${2^{N(N-1)/2}\choose dN/2}$$ since this is the number of all possible adjacency matrices. The asymptotics for fixed $d$ and $N\rightarrow\infty$ are then given by $$2^{dN^2(N-1)/4}\frac{1}{(dN/2)!}$$ which can be made more explicit using Stirling's formula. 

Given two coprime integers $a < b$ of different parities, only a finite number of points in $\mathbb N^2$ cannot be reached by a walk in $\mathbb N^2$, starting at the origin and using only steps of the form $(b,\pm a),(\pm a,b)$ (and thus making an acute angle with the north-eastern vector $(1,1)$). Is there a good upper bound on the number of such exceptional points? Is there a good upper bound on the coordinate sum $x+y$ of such an exceptional point $(x,y)$? (Remark: A naive proof that almost all points can be reached gives an upper bound which is probably very far from the true value.) 

This is a developement of my comment above: A not very satisfying (from a computational point of view) answer is as follows: Let $\mathcal L=\mathcal L(\lambda,i,j,n)$ be the set of all Young tableaux contained in $\lambda$, with a total number of $n$ boxes and containing the box labelled $(i,j)$. Each element $\mu$ of $\mathcal L$ gives a contribution $\alpha(\mu)$ as follows: Since $n$ is a corner of $\mu$, standard tableaux with box $(i,j)$ labelled $n$ are easy to count (as you observed) by removing the box $(i,j)$ and counting standard tableaux of $\mu\setminus(i,j)$. The difference $\lambda\setminus \mu$ decomposes into two skew tableaux $\mu_1,\mu_2$ which have to be labelled suitably by $n+1,n+2,\dots$ in order to get a standard tableau of $\lambda$. This contributes a binomial factor times the product of the number standard tableaux of the skew tableaux $\mu_1,\mu_2$ (which can be counted by a result of Stanley (On the enumeration of skew Young tableaux, Advances in Applied Mathematics, Volume 30, Issues 1–2, February 2003, Pages 283–-294)). Your number $N_{ij}(n)$ is then given by $\sum_{\mu\in \mathcal L}\alpha(\mu)$. The number of elements in $\mathcal L$ can be computed as follows: Remove the rectangular Young diagram defined by box $(i,j)$ from $\lambda$ leaving two ordinary Young diagrams $\lambda_1,\lambda_2$ at the right and below the rectangular tableau. The number of elements in $\mathcal L$ is then given by the number of pairs $(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ of tableaux containing a total number of $n-ij$ boxes with $\mu_1$ contained in $\lambda_1$ and $\mu_2$ contained in $\lambda_2$. 

A theorem (I do unfortunately not remember to whom it is due) states that there exists a finitely presented group containing a subgroup isomorphic to the additive group of rational numbers. Can somebody give an explicit construction? 

A lot of the discussion going on above is about the fact that we do not understand our mind's working. I do not even know if mathematical thinking is language-bound. I have the impression that it is not: mathematical discussions are more tedious in foreign languages but not more difficult. An analogy is perhaps a walk on a barely visible path. Sometimes you lose it and have to search for it. Glimpsing it again you tell yourself: "Ah, here it is again" but language is completely irrelevant even if it can be used to describe it to a friend. How do other people feel about this? Perhaps we are all different and do not see not the "same" reality. (Is your color "red" the same as my color "red"). Perhaps we are making a huge mistake assuming that different people think very similarly: For a dog, reality is made of a lot of scents, for a horse it is perhaps prairies and vast avenues where it can gallop. Some of us are perhaps "dogs" and other "horses" of mathematics and since most scents and prairies have not been named, we have to communicate through a limited common denominator, even among people of the same "mathematical species". 

Given a discrete group $\Gamma$ generated by $S$ let $K[S]$ denote the subring of the group-ring $K[\Gamma]$ generated by $S$ (over a commutative ring $K$). The ring $K[S]$ is thus a quotient of the free algebra generated by non-commutative variables indexed by $S$. Are there examples where the free monoid $S^*$ injects into $\Gamma$ but $K[S]$ is not free? (I guess the answer should be yes). On the other hand, there should also be examples where $K[S]$ is the free algebra of non-commutative polynomials over $S$, although $\Gamma$ is not free (this implies of course that $S^*$ injects into $\Gamma$). Remark: The subring $K[S]$ is of course isomorphic to $K[\Gamma]$ if $\Gamma$ is a torsion-group (or more generally, if all elements of $S$ represent torsion elements of $\Gamma$). 

Given a finite simple graph $\Gamma$ with vertices $V$, one can consider the Cayley graph of the group generated by transpositions of vertices corresponding to edges. This group is the symmetric group of the vertex set $V$ if $\Gamma$ is connected and it is the product associated to symmetric groups of the connected components otherwise. 

Does there exist a sequence $A_n=A_n(x)\in\mathbb F_2[x]$ over the field $\mathbb F_2$ of two elements (represented by $0$ and $1$) such that $A_n(0)=A_n(1)=1$ and the inverse series $1/A_n=\sum_{j=0}^\infty \alpha_{n,j}x^j\in \mathbb F_2[[x]]$ have supports with densities $\delta_n=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty} \frac{\alpha_{n,0}+\alpha_{n,1}+\dots+\alpha_{n,k-1}}{k}$ converging to $1$? A positive answer to this question would give a positive answer to question [Sum of densities of support of $A$ and $A^{-1}$ for $A=1+\dots\in \mathbb F_2[[x]]$ by considering $\frac{A_n(x^2)}{1+x}$. The highest possible density for polynomials of degree $\leq 16$ is $\frac{2}{3}$, achieved by $1+x+x^2$. 

Is there a nice description of all divisors of $n!$ which can be realized as cardinals of permutation groups acting transitively on $\{1,\dots,n\}$? A necessary condition is of course that such a divisor is a multiple of $n$. $n$ (cyclic) and $2n$ (dihedral) are always possible but, without mistake on my behalf, $3n$ is not feasible unless $n\equiv 1\pmod 3$ (it can then be realized as a semi-direct product analogous to the dihedral group). can only be realized if $3$ divides the number of invertible integers modulo $n$. 

A slightly different argument is as follows. Choose two symmetries $\sigma,\tau$ with axes intersecting at a point $P$ and forming an angle of $2\pi \lambda$ with $\lambda$ irrational. The composition $\rho=\sigma\circ \tau$ is then a rotation of infinite order generating a dense subgroup of the group of all rotations centered at $P$. Any closed subset left invariant under $\rho$ is thus a union of concentric circles centered at $P$. A simple closed curve invariant under $\rho$ is thus such a circle.
