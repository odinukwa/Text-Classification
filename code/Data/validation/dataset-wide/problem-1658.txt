however, it should be noted that the neurochemical and hormonal effects (which are much harder to measure) may have different durations. As far as whether or not women are more prone to having multiple orgasms, that is still a somewhat open question. It is clear that women are quite capable of multiple orgasm, however, there is still variance. Men have been observed to have multiple orgasms (even in the laboratory), however, there are not enough studies yet to make any conclusions about its prevalence. Furthermore, there is not even an accepted definition for what constitutes "multiple orgasm". From the survey: 

For traditional, single-blower-speed air conditioning systems, the efficiency of the system does not scale linearly with air flow speed. The blower motor's electrical usage scales superlinearly with respect to air speed. The faster the air speed the more the coil heats up, thus reducing its cooling efficiency the next time the condenser turns on: 

Yes. For example, many academic conferences that are sponsored by the US government have sessions for presenting classified (i.e., secret) research 

I believe this claim may have originated from (or at a minimum was perpetuated by) the book Kitchen Confidential. Therein, then New York chef Anthony Bourdain admitted that most fish suppliers in NYC are closed on Mondays thereby forcing restaurants to use older fish. If you accept Mr. Bourdain's word, then I think that confirms the claim. That book was written a decade ago, so I am not sure if that is still universally the case in NYC. The Fulton Fish Market, which is the largest in New York (if not the USA), is currently closed on Saturdays and Sundays. When they are open, however, the fish is very fresh: 

I'm adding this answer to address some of the comments on the other answers that were asking for studies based on small children and/or pregnant women. First of all, Dr. Rauscher's work on the Mozart Effect has received a lot of bad press in the academic literature: 

There has been a lot of work on this subject, most of which has even been peer reviewed! Even 30+ years ago, there were studies confirming confirmatory bias in peer review: 

I can't find a citation supporting this, but I do know from some chef friends that fish from Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market is flown in to Fulton on a regular basis. It is well known that Tsukiji's fish are very fresh, too: 

So, in all 35 countries that ratified that treaty, the employer would have had to give the employees advanced notice of the layoffs. 

Auto-brewery syndrome is a well-known but rare condition in which yeast living in the digestive tract can consume carbohydrates (sugars) producing alcohol, causing the host to become drunk even though he or she never consumed any alcohol. The yeast can overgrow in such conditions, persisting seemingly indefinitely until treated. Treatment comes in the form of antifungal medication along with a reduced sugar diet, which seems to address part of your question. From what I can tell, whether or not high sugar intake causes the yeast overgrowth in the first place seems to be an open question. 

Back in 2002, Payne conducted a study comparing three similar Unix-like operating systems, one of which was closed-source (Solaris) and two of which were open-source (Debian and OpenBSD) across a number of security metrics. He concludes: 

The tests did uncover "profound differences" in the types of salt used, especially in the beef tenderloin test, with large flaked sea salt winning by a large margin. Texture seemed to be important, as table salt (both iodized and non-iodized) won in the baking category due to their small crystals that evenly distribute in batter. None of the tasters could detect the difference between any of the salts when dissolved in liquids. 

As was mentioned in the comments, the employer could always immediately revoke access to the employee(s) and then provide some severance compensation, but unless the employees were being terminated for negligence (which sounds not to be the case in the supposed firedrill scenario), then the employer would likely want to have the employees work for that period anyway. 

In summary, I haven't really answered your question at all, however, in the process I've found this relatively amusing scatological study. The study does conclude that squatting is better at least for defecation. 

A widget is being sold by party X in London for $5. At the exact same point in time, due to market fluctuations, the same type of widget is being bought by party Y in New York for $6. If we can find out about #1 and #2 quicker than Y can find that same information, then we can buy the widget from X and sell it to Y at a $1 profit. 

A famous example of the efficacy (and also problems inherent in) mathematical modeling is the concept of Dynamic Hedging &leftarrow; a transcript of an excellent documentary on the subject. The model was created by Black and Scholes, for which they were awarded the Nobel prize in Economics. Under certain reasonable assumptions, their model is guaranteed to reduce risk in proportion to the amount of investment one has made (which seems a bit counter-intuitive at first). The best analogy up with which I can come is that Dynamic Hedging is a lot like opening a casino. The model ensures that the odds will always be in the house's favor, so in the long run you will, in expectation, make a profit. The problem is that every once in a while someone will likely "win big", and your casino will have to make a payout to them. That's fine, as long as you have enough liquid money to make that payout; you'll eventually recoup the loss in the long run. The problem is that, unlike a casino, the instantaneous risks of the market are unbounded. For example, there is unbounded risk associated with shorting a stock. Therefore, as long as you have an unlimited supply of liquid cash (or credit) to deliver those payouts along the way, you are guaranteed to at least break even. Black and Scholes' model was implemented in the form of a number of hedge funds, most notably Long-Term Capital Management, which enjoyed spectacularly consistent returns in the 40% range throughout the 1980s and most of the 1990s. The problem (I'm greatly simplifying things here) was that eventually the fund got so big that it was no longer able to borrow/acquire enough liquid capital to sustain itself. So what's happening these days? The financial concepts of arbitrage and hedging are theoretically guaranteed to be risk-free. The idea is quite simple: 

The patent goes on to explain that the reason why most traditional, single-speed blowers don't keep the blower on after the condenser has turned off is exactly because of point #3: The airflow will heat up the coil and require the condenser to remain on longer during the next cycle. The patent also claims that some traditional systems try and avoid this by only switching off the compressor when in blower-only mode (i.e., also keeping pumping the refrigerant), however, the patent says that that uses almost as much electricity as running the entire system: 

It depends what you mean by "campaign budget." If by that you mean how much a campaign spent, then no: The candidate who spent the most money (or for whom the most money was spent on their behalf) does not always win the election. The prime counterexample was the 2012 Obama/Romney election, in which Romney out-spent Obama by over $6 million and still lost. However, the Obama campaign had raised over $80 million more than the Romney campaign; they just chose not to spend as much. In the 2014 elections, there were a number of hotly contested congressional races in which the winner both raised and spent less money (e.g., Georgia senate, Colorado senate, California house of representatives, New York house of representatives, &c.). So, these counterexamples prove that the candidate who raises or spends more money does not necessarily win the election. Whether or not the candidate who raises/spends more money is statistically more likely to win is a different question that may in fact be true.
