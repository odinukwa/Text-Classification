As many links as the previous chain. Small-small. The RD should be barely expanded, the chain nearly rubbing against itself roller-cogs. The logic here is to be able to have the longest possible chain, that still allows shifting into any gear combination. Vertical rollers. Shift big front small rear. The rollers on the RD should be in a vertical line, below the cogs. In this position the RD is in a good working point, because it's spring is both tensioned (and thus stiff against vibrations) and not over-elongated (and suffering accelerated wear). This is the medium working point. Big-big without the derailleur. Without threading the chain through the RD, measure big-big and add 2 links. 

I do two things. 1) I have some experience(very limited) in martial arts. Just several sessions of falling with rolling over the shoulder. Also keeping a guard. 2) I always carry a backpack. When shit hits the fan, I try to detach myself from the bike (all of my damaging falls were due to getting stuck with the frame or the handlebars). Then I assume a fetus position, with the hands over my head, forearms protecting the face (I haven't had a helmet, but then - I ride cross-country), navigate my body weight to hit the ground backpack-first and then roll, avoiding hitting the ground with elbows(and breaking them). With this technique, I have ruined several backpacks, but have walked away from flying several meters and then hitting the stones. I never learned how to jump and run off the fall, however :( ADDED: Also, while being aware of your surroundings, in the city it is essential to be aware where the sidewalk is. Falling on the street isn't dangerous, it's the speeding car behind that can be fatal. ADDED2: So if you have the martial arts experience and she does not, just teach her! Forward and backwards roll, over left or right shoulder. Over level grassy field should take no more than several tens of hours! And being able to run, then jump face-down, then stand up unharmed is such a confidence builder. 

I am looking for a MTB, but am unsure how to measure if the frame would fit me. I haven't had a full-suspension bike. Furthermore, I am pretty sure MTBs perform entirely differently in the city and when going down a rocky track. My previous bike was small, short and awkward on pavement, but incredibly stable on the descents. When test-riding, I very much doubt that any shop will let me ride for a whole day. And from doing a couple of circles around the shop, rushing a couple of curbs, feathering or squeezing the brakes and doing a jump or two there is hardly any feel as to what riding will be like, when I get used to the bike. Kind of like with new shoes - at the start, every model is "awkward", as one has not gotten used to it. I will ask the guys at the shop to help me with fitting, of course, but concerning the test ride - how do I do it correctly? What information is most essential to gather during the very short ride and how do I do that? 

I asked at the LBS and was answered. The frame was apparently faced at the factory, pre-painting. There was a depression several mm long along the weld. They told me not to give it a sweat. Short depressions are not problem, at most it could allow moisture inside. But re-facing the frame could remove too much material e.g. if the depression is a couple of mm deep, the 2mm of material have to be removed. On the other hand, when can improper facing BE a problem is when there is an elevated section, or if half or more of the area is depressed. Then, when the cups are inserted, they will tilt, the axis will not be straight, and the bearings, axis and cranks will suffer elevated stresses. 

1) Loosen the two bolts, holding the caliper of the front brake. It should move freely sideways now. 2) Hold tight the front brake lever. The caliper will bite into the disc. 3) Tighten the bolts to the point when moving the caliper is possible, but requires a push by hand. 4) Lift the front wheel and validate that it doesn't rub. If it rubs try squeezing the lever again. Failing that, try adjusting the caliper by hand, to the point that it stops rubbing. 5) Either hold the break lever, or the caliper itself, so that it doesn't move. Tighten the bolts hard, but not to the point of damaging the threads in the fork. This procedure should take about 10 minutes at most. There are videos in youtube, depicting the process and explaining it better than me. Ask a separate question about the derailleur. 

At the shop, they said this was normal (duhhhhh!). In the end of any DH the brakes will smell of burnt plastic, they said. If there is a problem with pad glazing, it will be felt on the levers, making them noticeably stiffer, and the braking force reduced, they said. If the was air on the system, the levers are again the part to look at - a sudden lack of braking, followed by gradual (temporary) recovery, they said. So, bed your pads carefully. Feel your brakes and levers. Learn how to brake properly. And have fun. 

I know that when a fork stops working plushly, it should be serviced in order to escape permanent damage. When a chain is noisy, it should be oiled, and when it is worn - replaced - again to prevent damage.\ But what about the bearing in a full-suspension mountain bike frame? How do I tell if mine should be replaced? What calamity could result in not replacing them? 

@alex was right in advising not to use tools where no tools are needed. Similarly, it is easy to run frame BBs or brankarm threads by forcing the thread with a wrench, instead of by hand. Somehow, I had made the hose hard to unscrew by overtightening 2. I loosened it up, held it with a wrench and rotated the hose by hand. This solved the problem. 

The advantages of this bar ends position, compared to in the end of the handlebars are several. First, a more narrow and aerodynamic position is assumed. Second, standard grips can be used, without the need to cut them. Thirdly, for some reason those were HUGE aid on climbs. Currently they are off, due to too much clutter on the handlebars. 

Trying to replace the headset cups and race faces on a steel frame for 1" fork. Removed the old cups by gently knocking them in a circle with a steel pipe of the correct diameter. However, the new cup are a hair too small - although no wobble, they are freely inserted and removed from the head tube. The slack is much less than a mm. The LBS said that this is normal, and that they can fix it, by inserting something in between the head tube and cups. So is it normal? The headset is this one and the fork is a cheap Zoom 1 inch threaded fork. What should be inserted, so that the cups can be correctly installed? (I was planning on using the hummer and piece of wood technique) 

My rear hub is damaged. I have not yet inspected the source of the damage, but the wheel is moving sideways when rotating (a LOT), plus I rode it like this for about 35km. Therefore, I find it probable to soon need to replace the hub. The rim and spokes are new (couple of months of commuting). I suppose I wouldn't be running in the "old spokes new hub" problem. The old hub has 24 spokes. The disc rotor is attacked via 6 bolts. What else should I know in order to judge if a specific hub will be a compatible swap (beyond that getting the exact same hub should work okay). 

I am trying to learn some very small jumps and bunny-hops. It seems that upon landing from either, there are two options. I am talking here only about the moment of the impact with ground, and not about manoeuvring pre-jump or in the air. 

The Wikipedia article doesn't explicitly list the applications of graphite grease. Would it be suitable for bicycle bearings and threads? Furthermore, I went ahead and purchased a single package (the same price as the lithium grease). It says (translated): 

I need a low clamp 2x10 front derailleur. As it turns out to be a challenge to find locally, I begin to wonder 

I have less than 10 hours on SPD pedals. Unclipping is becoming more and more intuitive (I no longer fall to the side when stopping at a traffic light). While it still intimidates me to jump with clips, cornering needs to be done. When I approach a corner, regardless if on asphalt or on the trail, I look into the exit, rotate my head, chest and hips towards the exit, stay centered on the bike, but tilt the bike. My concern is that by rotating my hips I will accidentally unclip, dropping my foot to the ground in the most dangerous part of the turn. Do I need to worry about this, and if so, how to prevent it? PS: My pedals are mixed SPD/plaform pedals and the shoes are Cube AM. 

During operation, disc brake pads cut grooves into the rotor. When replacing the pads with new ones, would it be a good idea to smoothen the rotor with sandpaper(e.g. grit 200 then grit 800)? What is the role of these grooves on the disc in braking? 

5 degrees celsiusis is chilly and the main enemy is wind. Those are the areas of the body, that generate a excessive heat: 

I am looking to purchase a fork crown race installation tool, ant this one is the only one available online. The IceToolz thing is "to be delivered" someday. I am very skeptical of this tool, as it does not allow the user to hummer it with a hummer. How well would it work? 

I stumbled upon this gem recently. They explain that the most basic skill is the attack position. Here is my understanding of their teaching: 

The general advice about cornering is to lean the bike, not the body, to put pressure on the outside foot, and not to brake or brake only with the rear brake if absolutely needed. Well, does this advice hold for snowy terrain? Today is my second day riding in snow this winter and still have the feeling that if I lean the bike, it will simply slide out under me. The tires are Schwalbe Land Cruiser. So I actually lean my body, keeping the bike as straight as possible through the turns. Exactly opposite to the general advice. I am talking about 10km/h riding, and I already managed to fall a couple of times (luckily at those speeds falls are harmless, when outside traffic). "On snow" for the purpose of this answer means autumn leaves, over which there are several cm of frozen, hard or melting snow. I am fortunate that 1/3 of my commute is through a non-paved park, where I can practice funny things without the danger of being hit by a car. There are even some small (30cm) and other not so small ramps, but I haven't summoned the courage to jump those ... yet. 

I have an external bearing BB, that I need replaced (It is quite badly rusted). I opt to do the repair myself. The bike is a Specialized Hardrock, the crank arms are SR Suntour. Having removed the crank arms, I proceed to unscrew the plastic sealing rings of the BB. I removed the non drive side one. However, with all my strength, and a 30cm arm wrench I fail to produce any progress on the drive side cup. I am trying to turn the cup clockwise. What is going on here? Am I doing something wrong? If I go to my LBS, is it probable that they will have a larger wrench? 

Maybe slightly off-topic, but I would like to share. Past summer my touring/commuter MTB looked like this. 

General question: The rear tire of my mtb runs too close to the chainstays. If the trail is even remotely muddy, the mud buildup on the chainstay clogs the front derailleur and the chain begins to skip/drop. What can I do to remedy the situation, preferrabli without going to skinnier tires. 

about two revolutions, a quarter at a time, and see if you reduce the shifting inaccuracy to 1 gear only. If nothing happens, stop -> I was wrong. 

It was rugged and stable enough to handle 15kg of luggage on mountain dirt roads with rocks, mud, sand and sharp turns. 

Get brown shoes, this way the mud won't stain them. Get the longest possible gaiters - right up to the knee. 

Most mid to high level mountain groupsets (eg SLX and X7) have shifter options without any display as to what gear is currently active. How do riders avoid cross-chaining and other unpleasantnesses, especially when riding in the dark or on rough terrain (i.e. when they can't readily take a look at the rear cogs)? 

Schwalbe produces a wide range of tyres. Their "Basic compound" tyres are twice cheaper than the same model but with "Performance compound". Anyone have user experience with the two product lines? What are the practical differences? Are the Performance line MTB tyres made of "soft" rubber, that provides superior grip? 

Conclusion: Currently, the "derail the chain off the front chainrings" sounds most sane to me, because I can do it with my shoe, without getting oil on my hands. Still, carrying the lock on my waist, under the backpack belt, is the far best solution. Why do I even put it inside the backpack? 

A backpack would provide the best vibration damping and have the least detrimental effect on the laptop's lifespan. I have heard good things about this style of backpack-rider back interface. It is a thin mesh, supporting the backpack a couple of centimetres away from your body. 

For riding on level surface one should strive for high cadence. However, what is the best solution when descending over rough terrain? On one hand, because the legs are better suspension when the muscles are relaxed i.e. not pedaling, one could make a point for difficult gears. That way, with only a short 1/4 rotation of the pedals close to horizontal position, one can generate acceleration, then quickly return to horizontal position for the next obstacle. On the other hand, because easy gears make it possible to rapidly rotate the pedals backwards OR forwards, easy gears could be beneficial, providing move agility to avoiding pedal strike. Are there some guidelines, wisdom or tips of thumb about downhill gearing? 

On road: unpleasant wobble. Off road: no noticeable difference. I came to this conclusion after they fixed (install new asphalt) the street in front of my block. First time I rode on it, I discovered the front cones are pitted and the rear cones are overtightened. Other than that, I would expect to both the spokes and bearings be more severely loaded then when the wheel is true. 

Furthermore, it is beneficial to have two active rags at any time. The rough one is used to remove mud from the frame and drivetrain. The fine one is cleaner and used for cleaning the chain after lubing, the stanchions and any parts, near the discs of the rotors of disc brakes. 

You could compare the geometries of the FX and the Cross Check. Matching the standover, 56cm matches. Comparing the effective top tube lengths, between 58cm and 60cm match. Bottom line the geometries are different. On another note, the FX doesn't seem to be a particularly high-end bike, so purchasing a complete Surly could possibly provide more economical than moving the parts to a new frame. 

I ride hard-tail cross-country for recreation (Specialized Hardrock with disc brakes). Recently, my fork got damaged and now I am looking for a replacement. My current(now previous) fork has 80mm or 100mm travel, I'm not sure. My goal is to make the bike a little bit more "down-hilly". I believe that this can be solved by a long-travel fork, for example 140mm. The goal is to both improve the suspension and change the geometry to compensate for the slope of the trail. However I am completely at loss as to how to select a new fork. 

I think it is just experience. When I ride on a different bike, even with 1cm wider handlebars, I scratch things. IMO if you do more biking in tight spaces, but around cheep things - like walls, street light posts, you will gain experience and feel for the size of your bike. I mean riding deliberately close to obstacles, at low enough speed to have the luxury of actually scratching/hitting them. What's more, it is not just the handlebar - if you have a rear rack, that could scratch someone when turning, your pedals could hit the sidewalk, rear tire could touch bystanders, backpack - also. 

I have owned a dynamometric wrench for two years now, and I got it second-hand in the first place. I fear that relying on its indication could be even less accurate than tightening by intuition. For example, I know that oscilloscopes need to be tuned once per year. How can I measure the accuracy and precision of my wrench? I have a tape measure and a low-end electronic scale (rated 45kg+-10g, but I have noticed deviations as much as 50g between measurements of 2kg parts), plus a wide range of inserts for the wrench. This is a 20Nm-100Nm piece of equipment.
