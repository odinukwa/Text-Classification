Many of us hate to see the people who we view as less than competent getting the promotions, the chance to shine that no one gives us, and the place at a the table that we don't have. We wonder, "How come they listen to him of all people?" Social skills are what get you the things you want and help you avoid the things you don't want in the workplace. People above you don't automatically know that you are smart and capable. They don't automatically know that your ideas are better than the ones they are currently implementing. You have to to show them how you are contributing and what more you could contribute. You have to show them why your ideas are better. You have to talk to them in their terms. 

I doubt that any company that is worth working for would look down on you for looking for a another job if a layoff seems imminent. You have to protect yourself financially after all. However, don't quit the job until you find a new one. You are not going to get irrelevant with a couple of months or so of legacy support. In fact, it will help you understand better how to design new software that is not such a pain to support. 

If your name falls into one of these categories naturally, consider long and hard as to whether to use it or at least how to use it in your personal email. 

It is company specific how they would handle this but you would be working after the Christmas holiday, so likely that would be paid. However, Many companies would ask you to make DEc 30th your last day and not pay for the Jan 2 holiday. As that is a new month and New Year, they might not want to have to deal with benefits for one day which is a holiday. Depending on teh the health insurance situation at your new employer, you may want to give notice after the new year just to make sure you have health insurance in Jan. 

Internships are supposed to help you learn how to navigate the workplace not just teach technical skills. Quitting when things get tough is a bad choice. Show some grit and go talk to your manager about the problem and try to work things out. Find out why people are treating you like this. What can you change about how you deal with them that might improve things? Ask you boss specifically what you can do to do a better job and then listen to what he says and follow his advice. People don't just act rude and not want to give you work for no reason. Find out the reason before you quit so at least you can fix it in the next job. 

I would say that saying you are interested in "various analyst postions" would get you nowhere in well over 90% of the companies. HR wants applications for specific jobs and they won't take the trouble to apply you to those jobs if you didn't take the trouble to apply. Plus the actual qualifications for a financial analyst are considerably different than the qualifications for a database analyst which are different from the qualifications for a Business Analyst or a Security Systems Analyst or a Management Analyst. Analyst jobs are very different depending on the business they support and to say you want to apply for all of them indicates to any actual analyst (or manager of analysts) that you are most likely unqualified for any of them. Some analyst jobs require specific college degrees and others do not. Some require extensive business knowledge and some do not. Some require superficial statistical knowledge and some require a PhD in Statistics. I will point out that I have been both a management analyst and a data analyst and biggest similarity between the two was they had analyst in the name. Now if you have a senior level manager contact who has reason outside of job qualifications to be interested in you (son of a customer or a niece who just graduated type of thing, not I just met you for five minutes at a conference) this approach might work for that specific company. But not really unless the manager is a C-level manager who can tell HR to consider you for all such positions. If you are applying for multiple positions, then list each one specifically. Or write a separate cover letter for each application. What you are doing in saying "various analyst positions" looks as if you are not focused or worse not detail-oriented enough to bother looking at what was available which are bad traits for an analyst. With over 30 years of analytical experience, I am pretty specific in what I expect from an analyst and generalizations (especially those to get you out of doing some extra work) don't show any analytical ability at all. If you truly want an analytical job, you need to show those skills in your application. Different types of analyst jobs would need different discussions of why you are the best candidate in the cover letter and would require resumes that are different to emphasize different skills. A business analyst, for instance, needs business domain knowledge (what is needed for a business analyst in the pharmaceutical industry can be very different than what might be needed in the financial sector) and, most importantly, the ability to collect data from interviews with users and strong technical writing skills. A financial analyst may not have much direct people contact, but needs higher level accounting and mathematics skills and good report programming skills (which may include extensive knowledge of Excel and/or SQL). One cover letter and resume for both jobs would likely be weak for both because it would try to do too much. 

Since you are in the Measurement department (according to a comment on an earlier answer), then I would get with my boss and determine how we were going to deploy the tool you wrote and scheduled each individual who needs the install and then go to their desk and do it according to the schedule. Be sure to remove the old tool at the same time. Users do not want to install new software even when it is an improvement, there is a resistance to change factor. So the only solution is to do the install yourself rather than relying on them to do it. Since you are in the department that can mandate the measurement tool and the standard that are followed, use that organizational power and do the installs without asking them to do them. At the time of install for each person, take the time to walk them through how to use it. Much of resistance to change is that they feel unsure that they will be able to figure out how to use it. At the time of the install, make sure you explain to them exactly what they are getting from this new software that is an improvement over the old one. People resisting change need much more hand-holding at the beginning. They are afraid of your new tool. I know that sounds ridiculous but it is true. They think they will make mistakes using it; they think they won't be able to figure out where necessary functions are; they think it will slow down their work due to the learning curve and they are already behind or under pressure. You have to diffuse those feelings. 

When I was young, I had a similar problem. I really was a mess who couldn't look anyone in eye and spoke way too softly, forgot my points, and took everything as a personal criticism and was afraid that every word would cost me my job - I think you can relate. My boss sent me to a public speaking class because being able to make presentations to a hostile audience was a key part of my profession and that helped, but what really licked the problem for good was a specific practice technique. What I did was go into an empty room and practice and video tape. Over and over and over again until I could watch the tape without cringing. Spend a couple of full days at this (on a weekend if need be). Practice your gestures, exaggerating them at first until you can settle into a comfortable level of gesturing. Try different tones of voice, different volumes. Pretend to be someone who you think does a good job at those meetings. The way people learn best is by experimenting and exaggerating things helps you move from too little to too much to just right. The thing about exaggerating when you practice is that you know you are exaggerating and then you can relax more about it because it is supposed to be over the top. And for people who are not naturally extroverted, what you see as exaggerating in your mind, might just look polished and professional on the video. That is because we often underestimate how much we need to correct. And it is easier to back off of an exaggeration than to move away from what currently feels comfortable. I learned thing when getting coached for dressage - when the coach made me exaggerate, it was much faster to get to the exact position I should have been in than trying to get incrementally better. One key thing is doing this is to consciously try something different on each iteration of your presentation. Do the first one and review it and note what needs to change to be better. Be mentally prepared that it will feel horrible, trust that it will get better much more rapidly than you can guess right now. Then consciously change one and only of those things at a time until it does get better. So if you feel you are speaking too softly, the next time, try yelling, then try to move to a slightly lower tone of voice than that time. Eventually you will hone in on the correct volume. The work on the stiff gestures. Then work on looking people in the eye or whatever problems you have identified. Yes, this is hard work. It feels awkward and embarrassing at first. Do it anyway. It will pay off because you are in a field where you need to be able to do this. Start by fixing your presentation by yourself and then when you have gotten more confident that you can do the basic presentation well, then get someone to help you by throwing ridiculously hard questions at you as if they were the senior manager. Once you have the experience of being able to think on your feet, the real thing won't be nearly as intimidating. 

I wouldn't worry about them at all. How someone else manages his or her career is up to them. If they are doing their jobs well now and have been able to make changes when new technologies came up, then they are fine. Wanting everyone to be like you is a pipe dream. Some of us understand that human beings actually are more productive when they leave thier work at work and do other things at home. Many of us have other responsibilities outside work that do no allow us the time to do things like hackathons and weekend conferences or out of town trips. Some of us have children and some of us have part-time jobs and some of us are caring for sick relatives and some of us have spouses who get upset if we leave town and some of us are shy and hate to be in crowds of people. Some of them might very muich want to do these things and it hurts them greatly when you push and they have to say no because there is no one to watch thier sick wife. These events are not suited to everyone and to expect everyone to attend them is ridiculous. They are not the problem, you are because you have unrealistic expectations of others. If you make them feel excluded becasue they aren't like you and don't want to do the same things you do, then you become even more of a problem, so watch your own behavior and stop worrying about theirs. 

I find it odd that some of the answers/comments and somewhat the implication of this question is that mentoring is done to help people who are deficient in their skills. Mentoring is generally, in my experience, done to help people you think are capable of being promoted to higher level of responsibility and not the people you think are deficient at their current level. When someone is deficient, that is job training. Mentoring is generally best done when it arises naturally. Mentor people who work for you or that you have reason to be in professional contact with anyway and don't exclude minorities or women from that mentoring. But don't exclude all white men either. Don't go up to someone and say I want to mentor you. Pretty much anyone would find that offputting. Just start to provide advice as it is appropriate to the situation. Be someone who readily answers questions and is approachable. Then let people approach you for advice. In casual discussions start to talk about workplace issues of concern at a higher level than the person is to start to give them the senior perspective. I have mentored lots of people through the years, I have never once had to say to them, "Hey, let me mentor you." 

Whether this is legal or not legal depends entirely on the contract. Whether it is ethical, in my mind, depends on why this particular person was given the contract. When you hire a business, there is some expectation that the business will hire or subcontract who it needs to perform the work but will do the due diligence to make sure the work is properly completed according to the contract terms. When you hire an individual, it is more likely based on the skills that particular person brings to the table and thus it seems more like a bait and switch if he contracts out the work especially without letting the client know he is doing so (who is not his boss BTW if he is a contract worker but his customer). Further giving unauthorized people access to even anonymized data is a bad thing. The structure of the database is also generally proprietary information. The business has a need to know who has access to the database and the right to limit it to only people they have approved of. Doing this without letting the company know is almost certainly unethical and depending on the nature of the database could open him to a lawsuit or to losing the business if they found out. Further, he is responsible for the work. If he is too lazy to do the work, what are the odds he is properly checking it? What are the odds that the unofficial subcontractors are going to misinterpret the requirements when they have no access to the people who can answer their questions? What are the odds that the type of devs who can be hired at such little pay that he can make a profit on an individual contract are in fact going to produce work that is good enough? In this case, he may well produce such bad work that he will lose not only this contract but his professional reputation which could result in a much reduced ability to get new contracts. And this is actually what he deserves for losing track of ethical behavior in the first place. I missed earlier that his a a data entry clerk doing piecemeal work. I want to point out that for him to outsource the data entry, he would have to be providing his log in credentials to the workers he has hired and thus is giving them direct access to the company network. This is almost certainly unethical and may cause legal issues if someone uses that access to break into the company network. If there is a data breach and it is traced to his login, then he could be in serious hot water as most people who are given access to a company network are required to protect that access and often sign something stating they will not provide their login to anyone else. And even if they don't catch him for providing his login, he might have to take the fall for committing the data breach even if it was one of his "helpers" who did it. 

It is hardly a surprise that you want to do something for his going-away. So I would ask him what he wants. You could suggest a small meeting to say goodbye followed up with a lunch after Ramadan is over if he will be close enough to attend one.
