I like the calculus answers above such as evaluating integrals and infinite series as values of functions satisfying differential equations. The following are much more specialized but seems also to illustrate the point in the question, of deciding something about an individual case by virtue of its membership in a family. Mumford's proof that a smooth cubic surface has exactly 27 lines is of this type. He proves that cubic surfaces form a family, that the number of lines is finite and constant precisely on the connected family of smooth surfaces. Then he computes the number on one smooth surface. Hershel Farkas conjectured in 2004 that one can decide whether a 4 dimensional principally polarized abelian variety with an isolated "vanishing theta null" (an isolated double point on its theta divisor at a point of order two) is or is not the Jacobian of a genus 4 curve, by noting whether the rank of the double point is three or four. One way to check this is as follows: i) in the universal family of 4 dimensional ppav's, generic Jacobians are characterized by having two ordinary double points on theta. ii) an isolated double point at a point of order two splits into two odp's under deformation in any reasonably general family if and only if its rank is three. Thus a ppav with the stated hypotheses is a limit of Jacobians, hence is a Jacobian. The infinitesimal approach to the Torelli problem is another example. Classically one tried to show the Torelli map t:M(g)-->A(g) (assigning to a curve its Jacobian) is injective by using information in the image point t(C) = J(C) to reconstruct C, either the theta divisor or a birational model. This did not take advantage of the fact that C belongs to a family M(g) and that t is defined on the whole family. The infinitesimal approach uses the fact that the Torelli map is defined also at all curves near C, and thus uses information in the image of the differential, or in the kernel of the codifferential t*, to reconstruct C. This makes the problem of finding equations for C much easier since in general the kernel of t* contains all quadrics containing the canonical model of C, while from J(C) one can only reconstruct such quadrics of rank â‰¤ 4. In some sense all proofs by induction have this form. I.e. one proves a non trivial statement by checking it in a trivial case n=1, then bootstrapping up one case at a time by induction. Indeed the algebraic geometry example above of finding a curve of every genus with no automorphisms is a geometric form of induction from the easy case of genus 2. The inductive step is the upper semicontinuity statement. 

I recommend part III, the case g=2, of Mumford's ":Towards an enumerative geometry of the moduli space of curves", in the Shafarevich 60th birthday volume. 

Technically I recall from the Tata lectures, that it is Ag(4,8) that embeds via theta nulls. Another nice reference is Freitag's book on Siegel modular functions. 

To give the opposite suggestion from Bart, I was going to recommend Matsumura's Commutative ring theory as opposed to his Commutative algebra. I have said why at length on the "unanswered questions" thread asking exactly Pete's question. Briefly, Ring theory is clearer, better organized, argued more fully, with more exercises (and answers), references, with a better index, and easier to read. Probably because Miles Reid rendered it into English, and possibly also because Matsumura got to revise his first book, which was almost a set of (excellent, and advanced) class lecture notes. At least two of us who took Matsumura's class in 1967 (Sevin Recillas and I) seem to like the second book. Sevin owned and recommended it when i complained I had difficulty using the original book. Since I am judging based on what appears on Amazon, I cannot be positive it contains every result I want to reference, but from the table of contents I would guess it does. I also like Zariski and Samuel for clarity, but homological methods were introduced just as that book was finished. 

As always, the source you use may be related to what your goals are. To give some perspective, recall there are several ways to define sheaf cohomology, and Serre and Hartshorne feature different methods. Serre used Cech cohomology, and there the important long exact sequence property does not always hold. He was able to prove however that it does hold for "coherent" sheaves. One big advantage of Cech theory is its easier computability in specific cases, such as on projective space. Hartshorne presents first Grothendieck's theory of derived functor cohomology, but then proves it agrees with Cech cohomology before using that theory to compute the cohomology of coherent sheaves on projective space. But if you want to learn the derived functor theory you must choose Hartshorne over Serre. The distinction made above between schemes and varieties is also relevant. Serre teaches Cech cohomology on varieties,and Hartshorne presents derived functor cohomology on schemes. If you are only interested in varieties, or prefer learning cohomology in the easier setting of varieties, then you may prefer Serre's FAC. Another good source is the book Algebraic Varieties by George Kempf, where the derived functor theory is presented on varieties and used for basic computations, including coherent cohomology of projective space and even the full Riemann Roch theorem, before being linked with Cech theory. So if you want to learn to make computations with the abstract derived functor theory you might prefer George's treatment, although some details are missing there, and some misprints exist. Finally there are slight differences in Serre's and Hartshorne's results which can be relevant in some settings. E.g. in Beauville's book on surfaces, he uses Cech theory to relate rank two vector bundles on curves with ruled surfaces. To prove that all ruled surfaces arise from vector bundles he then uses Serre's result that Cech H^2 vanishes on a curve with coefficients in any sheaf coherent or not. (He also gives a second argument.) But this vanishing theorem for Cech cohomology does not follow from Hartshorne's treatment, since he proves vanishing for derived functor cohomology but does not relate derived functor and Cech cohomology on non coherent sheaves above degree one. There is a sentence in Hartshorne, at the end of chapter III, section 2, page 212 in the 1977 edition, which says that Serre proved vanishing for "coherent sheaves on algebraic curves and projective algebraic varieties", whereas the correct statement would be that he proved it "for curves, and for coherent sheaves on projective algebraic varieties". Since Robin is very careful, one wonders whether some well intentioned copy editor did not change this sentence's meaning unwittingly to make it flow better.
