You are correct. The reason for the rebound control so so you can adjust the fork for your riding. If the rebound is too fast, the fork acts like a pogo stick - you hit a bump, the fork soaks it up then 'pings' back so fast it unweights the front wheel, (with fairly predictable consequences) when it happens while cornering. If the rebound is too slow, you go over a bump, the fork soaks it up, but before it rebounds back you hit the next bump. A few bumps later, the fork is at the bottom of its travel (with predictable consequences). The trick is to adjust the rebound so its fast enough that the fork recovers without bottoming out, but slow enough that it holds the front wheel firmly on the ground. There is a little science behind this, but as every rider, bike and trail is different, there is not way to tell you how you should set your fork up. On top of all this is (if its an air shock) - the amount of air pressure in the shock affects the amount of damping needed. If you have air shocks, there is now some science around setting them up - you can buy/beg/steal/hire a Shockwiz 

Unless the correct fork is chosen , the bikes geometry will change. A rigid fork built for a bike designed for rigid forks has a smaller axle to crown measurement than a suspension fork. If your bike is designed for 100mm travel suspension, and you put "any old" rigid fork on, the front of you bike will be 100mm lower than it is now. Even if you correct this in the Steerer/stem/handlebars, this will be enough to upset the rake and therefore alter the handling of the bike. (refer @Benzo for the answer to this problem) The bike will (should) be significantly lighter with the benefits that go with that. If you are riding smooth pavement, the changes will be you feel more bumps, and need to use you arms to absorb and control the front of the bike if you hit small bumps in corners. Tyre choice and pressure becomes more important, as does attention to the surface ahead of you. The big gain is that you bike is more efficient - no soft squashy absorbing energy in the front end (even locked out suspension moves) - you will go faster. Off road riding is a completely different ball game. If you are used to suspension and riding bumpy ground hard, you will need to change you style. Expect a few prangs along the way. When riding suspension, you weigh it in corners and let the shocks hold the front wheel on the ground over the bumps. Without suspension, the same technique will lead to the front wheel bouncing and loosing traction, with predictable consequences..... You need to learn to let your arms become the suspension, and your arms need to control the front wheel no only in direction, but "height" and "pressure on ground". The term "loose" takes in a new meaning. It requires more skill and concentration, and far more attention to detail than riding a suspension setup give, as well as being physically harder, but also in some ways, more rewarding. 

If the 30 is worn to the point its slipping and jumping, I would my guess the others must be due for replacement, along with the chain. Individual cogs tend to only be available in high quality gear, so a new cluster will probably cost less than a single cog. Replace the cluster and chain if you can afford it. If not, the cheapest way would be to get a beater from the tip, side of road etc, and take the 30/32 off that. Its rare that the largest cogs are worn out more than the others (more teeth per rotation, lower torque) so even a really old bike is likely to have a useable large cog. 

From the drive train, Chain/Cluster/Chain ring(s) would normally be enough and should be done together, or the old components would wear out the new one quickly. Although you can get by not changing the chain ring if you replace the chain often, if the chain is badly worn, a new chain ring is strongly recommended. Check the pulleys on the derailleur for wear, and replace if needed. The derailleur itself may or may not be worn out - Unless obviously sloppy, I would leave buying a new one till the new drive train was in place, I had replaced the cable and checked hanger alignment and still could not get it to shift well. Based on the wear on the drive train, I would presume the bike has been somewhat neglected. Check the BB and pedals while the chain is off. Check the headset and wheel bearings, ideally clean and repack. Unless in obviously new condition, I would replace shifter and brake cables as they are cheap, although if you don't have cable cutters and they are working well its possibly more effort than it worth. 

Uphill - gears and weight. Extending the lowest gear range till its faster and easier to walk and push the bike is cheap and easy and would be the first thing on my list to do. Cutting down weight (of the bike) is an has an exponential cost/gram relationship - you quickly get from $1/gram to $100/gram. Cutting your weight does not require the cash, and in most people cases a very effective way to gain speed uphill. (Shaving 5kg off a bike will cost $1000's, even if possible, many people can afford to loose twice that). Although you said no engine, in your situation (hot, uphill, no shower at end, health concerns) a pedal assist electric bike would be a very effective way to achieve your apparent aim. Would you be prepared to rethink that position and consider an eBike? 

Normally to change the gearing you only need to increase and decrease the size of the cogs. The number of gears determines the difference between gear shifts, ot the end gears. No need to upgrade to 24 speed. I advise caution making too many changes as its a lower end bike and parts are expensive. Overall the bike looks reasonably geared for a road bike. I suspect you are not cycle fit, hence the problems are more about technique and specific fitness than the bike. If you want to increase the top speed, you will need to increase the size of the larges front cog or decrease the size of the smallest rear cog. you current have 50x12 respectively. A 50x11 would give you around 10% more speed. Changing the front to 52 would probably not be worth it. The lowest gear is determined by the small front / large rear cog. In you case you are running 34/28. For road use this is reasonable already, although for hills lower might be better. To lower your lowest gear, either decrease the size of the front cog or increase the rear. Unfortunately the rear derailleur is only rated for 28 tooth max, so you will need to replace this. A 30 front chain ring would help - are you chain rings bolted or riveted to the crankest? If bolted they can be changed individually - but increasing the difference may require a new rear derailleur. I would suggest that if you decide to go ahead and spend money, upgrade the derailleur and look for a cassette (rear cogs) in the range 11/13/15/18/21/24/30 or 32. Likely you will also need a new chain as the larger rear cog will probably mean the existing one will not be long enough. As always, Sheldon Brown has excellent information. 

You will go further and faster on a road bike for the same effort. You go further and faster on a better (i.e. more expensive) bike. Training is not about going further and faster for the same effort, its about putting in more effort. So, will a road bike make a difference - only if you will put in more effort on the road bike than the MTB. If the idea of road riding spins you wheels, get a road bike because if you are enjoying it the training will happen. If the idea behind a road bike is a road bike lets you go the same speed and distance for less effort, a road bike will not help you meet your training objectives, except if you enjoy doing the same speed and distance for less effort, you are more likely to keep doing it rather than stopping altogether. (you could pretty much 'road' in the above and other adjective describing a bicycle here) 'expensive', 'fat', 'single speed', 'Down hill', 'pink' Plenty of people ride in sub freezing temperatures, its entirely possible to do so and enjoy. More people pack their bikes away for winter because its too hard. Only you can decide which group you want to be in. 

First got though this park Tools guide If you are still having problems, I suspect the derailleur cable. Either replace it (best option as they are cheap) but its worth flicking the outers off the bosses, cleaning and lube as much of the cable as possible. If this improves things, a new cable may be needed. If this does not help you probably need to check the derailleur alignment. unfortunately your derailleur has an integrated hanger so its harder to check. Fortunately, as its only 5 speed, accuracy is not so important. If noticeably bent, you can straighten it using an adjustable spanner, but will have trouble getting it accurate. Another possibility is the derailleur is flogged out, although in my experience kids don't change gears enough for this to happen 

Remove the seat and seat post from the bike, install the baby seat, reinsert the seat post, done If the seat post does not have a quick release, go to the local bike shop and buy one for $5. 

Likely a a better rider would have stayed on, and there is work to do on you technique, but your suspension should not miss behaving like that. Your comment about rebound settings strongly suggests to me that will the route cause of the problem. Sag is at the very best a starting point. Once you have the sag correct, you have a 'stake in the ground' to start tuning the suspension. The other settings are perfect for the average rider. The average rider has 2.5 kids, 13 feet a white picket fence and 1.2 dogs, my guess is you are not average :). Have a look at this video. MTB Suspension Setup - How To Get It Dialed In 10-Minutes The sag sets the amount of support the suspension offers - too little and you bottom out, too much and you don't get to use all the travel and don't get the benefit of it. Rebound sets the rate the suspension comes back after being compressed. Too fast rebound and you experience what you have had happen - the bike 'bounces' and you loose control (on the front the wheel lifts and it gets sketchy, on the back, you get flicked up, which with weight back and too straight legs could be turned into forward surge ). Too slow rebound and the shock /fork has not recovered before the next bump. After a few bumps, you have run out of travel. The idea is get the rebound of the front and back balanced so the whole bike lifts evenly. You also need to get it so it rebounds just fast enough to recover, without being so fast it lifts wheels off the ground. If anything, set rebound slower than ideal, and speed it up until you feel its too fast, then wind it back a notch or two. 

Hydraulic Disks should be less maintenance than rims. They are self adjusting, all you need to do is replace pads when worn. They may need the occasional bleed, which is a more involved task than rim brake maintenance. Beyond that, if they have problems, its usually easier to replace the brake than repair it Cable disk brakes have the same adjustment requirements as rim brakes, easier pad replacement than rim brakes and in all probably about the same level of maintenance. Rim brakes are simple, light and reliable. All you need is the occasional adjustment and new pads. They are fiddly to replace and adjust compared to modern disc brakes, but its not a big job. In terms of rim wearing out, its not something I would factor into a decision. Wear is something that happens on a bike, if you want reliable long life, avoid super lightweight racing components and go for quality components designed for reliability. For instance, put on a 32 spoke touring wheel rather than a 16 spoke racing wheel. 

Several things coming to mind when I read this. a) If the wheel is not centred, its not sitting in the drops correctly. If its not sitting in the drop-outs correctly, the axle to derailleur mount distance and the angles of the derailleur to cassette are off. There is little point looking at derailleur adjustments unless the wheel is centred. b) Smallest smallest is cross chained. Performance of derailleur in this state is relatively unimportant c) The derailleur was properly adjusted before the wheel was removed.... The thing that affects the clearance of the jockey wheel is the B screw - was this changed? The first thing to do is put the wheel on straight, remove the cross loading by putting the dérailleur onto the largest rear cog, and if needed, adjust the B Screw. 

To change from 8 to 10 you will need an upgrade to 10 speed shifters and likely a new derailleur. Almost certainly it would be cheaper to sell the bike and buy another, I would recommend against spending that amount of money on that bike. The rear derailleur should be OK, the Altus have a capacity of 43 and max cog size of 34. The front is rated 48MAx, 20 Capacity. A 8 or 9 speed 22/32/42(e.g. Shimano M361) crankset would be ideal, but are not that common in better quality sets. 22/30 is a seriously low gear, you will be riding slow enough maintaining balance will be a problem. You can also get a 11/34 8 speed cluster, giving an even lower 22/34 at the expense of wider gear inch gap. 

You may be interested in this .. The 1992 Bridgestone catalogue (8meg PDF) The bike is the lower end of the range (MB-6 being lowest), meaning its not worth that much and never started out as a great bike. As its steel (one redeeming feature), its possible to cold form the frame to widen the rear drop outs to take a 10speed, so technically its possible...... Practically its not worth it. The bike is old and low end. To upgrade to 10Speed you would need 

Maybe, we need to know more about the new bike. Wheel size - the 27.5" wheel will probably fit, (provided its not a plus or fat), but if its rim brakes, the brake bosses will be in the wrong place. You may or may not be able to find brakes that fit. If Disc brakes it will be fine Axle - traditionally axles were all 9mm QR, now there are though axles so you will need to make sure the axle is the same Headset - standards have changed. Anything earlier than about 2010 will be straight 1 1/8", the tapered steerer became available and more and more popular on MTB's and is moving to others. Is it worth it - probably not. Hybrids don't typically come with great suspension forks, I would not recommend reusing an old fork unless it was a high quality one and the swap was easy (i.e. headset, axle, brakes compatable). Over time the forks degrade, especially if not serviced, and don't perform as well as they used to. A cheap suspension fork that's degraded is probably worse than no suspension. 

Given the frame is designed for 100mm fork, its unlikely its strong enough to handle riding that needs a 160+mm travel fork, and frame failure is possible. Its not the dual crown that is the problem - its riding a frame designed for 100 travel (typically XC) in a way that needs 200mm travel (typically extreme down hill). Changing the fork travel changes the frame geometry and compromises handling. The original fork has 100mm, the bike is not designed for higher travel forks, anything more that about 120mm would starting to affect the handling. Above about 140mm, the bikes geometry would be all out of kilter, and it would be a completely different feel to what it is now. For the same price, modern single crown forks in the 120-140mm travel are as good as any dual crown for enduro riding. The original fork being a XCM100 also means its an entry level frame. I doubt the frame would benefit significantly from a decent dual crown fork over a decent single crown which would be nearly as stiff and lighter weight. Adding all this together, if you really need more than 120mm travel, you would be better to buy a bike built for it. If you only need 120mm travel, a single crown fork will do the job best.
