It appears that there are about a 100 currently unidentified murder victims in the US (that the wikipedia editors bothers to collect). Given that there are ~ 15k homicides in the US annually, I don't think there is much statistical significance here: it is rare for a victim to remain unidentified and it is very rare for such a crime to be solved. 

information distribution system. The only "prior art" I can think of are medieval market-square announcers (heralds?), but they broadcast to a very limited audience. In fact, it took about 20 years between the invention of radio and the start of public broadcasting - because the business model was not clear. TV was used for civilian broadcasts right away - without any period of "military-only technology". In a way, the Radio/TV relationship is similar to the Telegraph/Telephone relationship. The first in each pair was a true revolution. The second was a crucial improvement. Radio started public broadcasting. TV improved on it. Telegraph started instant communications. Phone improved on it and made it a household item. 

As @BigDataLouis mentions in an answer he has deleted, Elvis Presley had an identical twin brother, delivered stillborn. You can find many more in the List of twins and Twins in mythology. Presley case sheds some light on why this is rare: twins (and, in general, multiple fetuses) compete for mother's resources in the womb and, on average, have lower birth weight. After birth they face more competition for parental support. Thus, ceteris paribus, they are less likely to grow up strong or develop their talents as much as single births. Those who are "born into fame" (e.g., royalty) face a different issue: an identical twin of a first born prince would be a threat to the peaceful succession (cf. the legend that The Man in the Iron Mask was Louis XIV's identical twin) and could even be murdered at birth. 

Most people are familiar with the outline of this retreat - essentially, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had establish an un-recognized governance over parts of Jianxi and Fujian. The GMD attacked, and the CCP fled to join with communist forces in north China. They settled in Baoan 

I personally don't like this question because it gives credence to racial theories. Scientifically speaking, there is more variation from individual to individual than there is between peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. Anyway, addressing your question: One theory I've heard is that King Phillip's war was the cause. The idea behind this theory is simple: When the pilgrims arrived at Plymouth Rock in 1620, the Native Americans aided them in establishing themselves, and helped them not to starve, by teaching the pilgrims, people who had lived as refugees in the Urban Netherlands for a generation, to learn farming and survival skills. They even celebrated the first thanksgiving together. In New England, generally speaking, the contact between the Europeans and Natives Americans were more than cordial - there was intermarriage, and conversion to Christianity, and peaceful coexistence. The primary difference between the two populations was more one of lifestyle than one of race. By about 1670, the mixing of the two populations, combined with declining Native American populations and quality of life, set the stage for "King Phillips War" Supporting Source and Wikipedia links. The common narrative goes like this: Metacom, a Native American nicknamed "King Phillip" by the settlers, started attacking and slaughtering the colonial population. The English colonialist responded in kind, slaughtering the Native American population. Both sides killed whichever "enemy" they came across, including women and children. Persons of mixed heritage were victims of both sides. 5% of the settler and 40% of the Native American population died. The general slaughter led to well defined racial identities that didn't exist before the war, and set the stage for future separate ethnic trends in North America. There is, of course, an opposing theory presented in this book that the war was not about race at all, but was instead a civil war intended to increase British control of the region, which used "divide and conquer" strategies, split what was a unified community to increase colonial power. One results of the increase British control was marginalization of the Native population, and a stronger racial identity for the settlers. 

However, antisemitism did not disappear, it is just names its targets differently (Rootless cosmopolitans, Zionists). The roots of antisemitism are simple - xenophobia is a normal (i.e., common) part of human psyche and it manifests itself in all sorts of bigotries. All minorities suffer from its consequences (e.g., Chinese in California 150 years ago as documented by Mark Twain). When the hated minority is "invisible" (almost completely assimilated, like the Jews in Germany 100 years ago), the bigotry can feed conspiracy theories and become much more vicious. The only part of Nazi antisemitism which was unprecedented was the scale, i.e., applying the full power of 20th century industry to the task of exterminating people (Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals &c). The racial laws were not particularly exotic by world standards (cf. Dhimmi). 

The most common answer ("accepted narrative") to this question would be the Soviet Ambassador in Washington Nikolai Novikov's telegram of September 1946. However, given the traditional and consistent Russian/Soviet mistrust of the West, it can hardly be viewed as a "milestone" similar to The Long Telegram. Rather than shape and direct policy, it merely helped reinforce the existing position and alert Moscow to the Washington's awakening to Moscow's attitudes. Suffice it to observe that USSR suppressed democratic opposition to communism in Eastern Europe from the get go, even before the VE day. 

Both sides tried both approaches. However, the Central Powers were better at crushing (because or their central location and Auftragstaktik) - even though submarine warfare brought them some successes; while Entente was better at choking (because they controlled much more resources and could blockade the Central Powers) - even though they scored some coups on the battlefield too. The Central Powers biggest coup was the defeat of Russia, brought by support of Bolsheviks, which might have won them the war, had they not brought the US into the war by the Zimmermann Telegram. The biggest mistake (of both sides, but more disastrous for the Central Powers) was trying to break the stalemate "evolutionally" (by massive use of manpower) rather than "revolutionary" (e.g., using tanks, aircraft, infiltration tactics &c). Of course, it is easy for us to theorize now - Ludendorff and Foch did not know what we know now. See Liddell Hart's works on strategy for more on this. 

It think this is a really cool story - and want more detail. Did the farm where he landed have a phone? Did they let him use it? Did he wait at that farm, or did they give him a ride into town? How long did he wait there? Did they send a taxi from Saratov? What did he do? I visualize that there was a local grandma who make him a big meal and he drank a bit of vodka while waiting a few hours for his ride. Or maybe he took a nap at the farmer's house? I imagine it took a few days for him to return to Moscow. Did he tell the people he met that he just got back from space, and did they believe him? Was he rushed home and treated like a hero, or did they just tell him to buy a bus ticket and save his restaurant receipts? Did anyone hassle him? 

Most phenomenal rise was by Zhu Yuanzhang who went from being an orphaned from a destitute peasant family to the first emperor of the Ming Dynasty. His rise to power took about 11 years. Summarized in list form: 

Background: When I was a US 3rd grader (1983?), my social studies class informed me that "nobody" in the Soviet Union liked their government. This was obviously false information; at the very least, at least one person would like it, right? As a 7th grader, my history class talked about how the party members were rich and liked to be in power, but everyone else hated the government. How could such a small group hold so much power? The incorrect answer that my classmates came up with was that all Russians were cowards who hated freedom. This is obviously wrong; WWII and the Sputnik were great refutations. Later in life(~2010), I had a Russian friend whose old mother had come to live with him in the US. She was a diehard anti-American; she loved the Soviet Union her whole life, and had always been poor. So at least one non-powerful non-party member supported the government. From my reading of how the communist party and government was structured, and how reforms were implemented, it appears that many people - above 60% - supported the revolution and subsequent economic organization. However, I'd love to see some peer-review data. 

Appanage Cadet branches arise under the system of Primogeniture when a younger son receives appanage and manages to establish it as a power base to his own line. Note that the "line" here is not an independent royal line, it is a line of (senior) vassals to the main royal line. If the main line dies out, the cadet line will claim the throne, but otherwise it will merely supply spouses and (usually senior) royal officials. It is possible that a cadet branch will eventually split its fief from the main kingdom (if the central government grows weak), in which case it will no longer be referred to as a cadet line, but an independent "house of so-and-so". However, it is more likely that in such a case it will exploit the main line's weakness and its own lineage to seize the throne. Career When younger sons are instead (of granting them appanage) encouraged to pursue a career (either military or religious), no cadet branch is usually established, as they either have no descendants due to celibacy or death on the battlefield or marry into another royal (or just noble) house. 

Mechanization - attempted in the form of MTS during Collectivization Chemistry - attempted by Khrushchev. 

I would love to see an answer to the "guiding questions" too. Here I will provide a mathematician's (game theorist's, in this case) background on the subject, answering the question "qui prodest" - in case of one state splitting in two. If you think this "side topic" has no place here, I will delete the answer. Tax base: this is a zero-sum game: is those who secede are "rich", then they benefit from keeping their taxes to themselves, while those they secede from suffer. This is not interesting. Presidential Elections: this is interesting because the Shapley value is super-additive! This means that the total power of the two new states will be smaller that that of the original state. This implies that the other states will benefit from the secession. To make it clear, let us consider an example. Suppose we have a huge state which has over 50% of electoral votes. This means that this state determines the outcome of the presidential election completely. So its Shapley value is 1 and everyone else's 0. Now that the state is split in half, the other states have a say in the presidential elections, which benefits them. Congress: the share of representatives is proportional to the population and thus does not change, but the number of senators is fixed per state and this does change. Since this is more visible and simpler to understand than Shapley value, the other states might incorrectly think that the secession is against their interests because it dilutes their representation in the Senate.
