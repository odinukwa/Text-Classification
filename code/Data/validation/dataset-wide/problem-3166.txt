After Independence, the Indian National Congress was confident of winning a General Election because of its superb grass-roots network and system of patronage. Moreover, Nehru understood that it was his enemies on the Right who had most to lose from free and fair elections while his friends on the Left, outside the Congress, stood most to benefit. Convincing election victories- in which the main opposition was visibly Leftist- gave the Indian regime great legitimacy. There could be no question of an Army coup because the Sandhurst trained General Staff had less influence over the NCOs than their 'gram sarpanch' (village headman) who was probably already part of the Congress machine. In Pakistan, the situation was very different. Jinnah and Liaqat's Muslim League had successfully played the 'Islam in danger' card but there was no way they could carry East Bengal- which had the majority of voters and whose politicians were far more like their counterparts across the border. Even within West Pakistan, immigrant politicians like Liaqat were at a disadvantage. The Muslim landed gentry preferred to deal with Aristocratic Premiers, like Tiwana, as opposed to verbose middle class lawyers . On the other hand, the military- because their officers were rewarded with generous land grants (something which didn't happen in India)- had to work with the 'feudal' land-lords and accommodate their interests. In any case, after the assassination of Liaqat, the Muslim League had no West Wing leaders of stature who were not disqualified by reason of Religious affiliation. In the event, a former soldier turned Political Service officer rose to the top but his unpopularity was such that the ambitious Army Chief had no difficulty packing him off to exile. What alternative was there to the Army? The politicians wouldn't hold elections and thus secure legitimacy because they would lose. The Civil Service had no link to the grass-roots. By contrast, the Army had a network which reached down to the villages. Thus General Ayub Khan saw it as sponsoring something called 'Basic Democracy'. However, elections were still represented a source of danger. Fatima Jinnah, the elderly sister of the founder of the country, did surprisingly well by falsely claiming that Ayub had sold out to the Indians on the Indus water issue. Democracy wasn't good for Pakistan. It split the country and then enthroned a paranoid dictator. The Army had to step in to hang him by the neck simply to save their own skins. In contrast to India, the Pakistani political class had not developed esprit de corps by sharing jail cells nor had they established a personal reputation for self-sacrifice. By contrast, the Pakistani soldier- however much he might enrich himself- needed to have shown courage in battle simply so as to be accepted by his peers. Thus, disillusionment with elected politicians, who enrich themselves unconscionably, always leaves a window open, in Pakistan, for military intervention because there literally is no alternative. 

Mounted soldiers date back at least to the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and were a significant part of Persian armies, who emphasized heavily armored horsemen (including armor for the horse); the general term that gets used for these pre-medieval heavy cavalry is cataphract. It's true that the Romans didn't emphasize cavalry much, but they did end up deploying some heavy cavalry units in the east, against the Parthian and (later) Sassanid Persians; the Byzantines continued this practice in their wars against the Sassanids. The idea of stirrups (which showed up long after armored, lance-using cavalry appeared in the Levant) as a critical invention is generally now seen as an exaggeration. (Stirrups are better, certainly, but mounted warriors were able to brace themselves and deliver powerful attacks using well-designed saddles prior to the appearance of stirrups.) See here for a list of references on the stirrups issue. As for mounted archery: it certainly was a significant advance -- groups like the Mongols and Turks used it very effectively, and tended to defeat European knights when they fought against them -- but again it's something pre-dating the Romans, as Luis Henrique noted in his answer. There are clear records of it from the Neo-Assyrian Empire. If you want a nice illustration of when these things were actually in use, there's the Battle of Carrhae (53 BC), where a Roman army was wiped out by the Parthians using a combination of cataphracts and horse archers. (But note that the Romans also won battles against the Parthians and their successors the Sassanids, so the "cavalry always defeats infantry" argument is clearly false.) 

Many Britishers in eighteenth and nineteenth century India purchased land from private sellers, including native sellers, for a variety of purposes including agriculture, construction of factories, go-downs etc. In addition they could bid for leases- sometimes very large ones- from either the East India Company or a Native Raja. Indian law was not fundamentally different from English law. Notionally, the Queen owns all land and a 'freehold' is a thousand year lease. Land ownership can give rise to a tax liability in England. However, it would be ludicrous to suggest that the Queen owns all the land and that one can only acquire land from her by paying a tax. 'Eminent Domain', of course, applies but, in general, the Govt. does not interfere in commercial transactions in realty. Elementary Economic theory states that even if there is a large amount of uncultivated land- as happened in America as the nation expanded Westward- still, some land more conveniently located or boasting a particular amenity will command a premium accruing to the seller. Mention of the purchase of land can be found in the Jatakas and other early literature showing that the same laws of Economics as applied in Europe also applied in India. Divergence between European and Indian practice did not arise because of any legal difference but tracked either localized demonetization consequent upon an external shock or else, a strategic disintermediation of the tax-farmer. The state of historical scholarship on the topic of tenure was quite appalling (deliberately so, in some cases) and the work of people like Moreland or Sir Atul Chatterjee has long been superseded. 

I get the impression that the imposition of strong Germanization after 1870 partly backfired, in that it inspired resistance among the Poles and a strong desire to retain and promote their own culture. This would have included things like home schooling in Polish, private schools for education in Polish, and the like. (The Russians outlawed private Polish schools after 1863, but Poles went ahead and set up illegal private schools in places like Warsaw anyway.) (And I suspect even for those Polish-speaking kids who didn't have home schooling in written Polish, being literate in the Latin alphabet from learning to read and write German in school would get you about 90% of the way there -- sure, you don't initially know all the details of the orthography, but you know all but a couple of the letters and you know what all the words are supposed to be, because you already know the language.) Finally, there's the fact that the relatively liberal Austrian-controlled Polish region (Galicia) was right next door; interested Poles could travel to Cracow or Lwow for a proper Polish-language university education, for example. (We have to remember that international travel in the 19th Century was generally a lot less restricted than it is now.) 

The Viennese were considered decadent and frivolous, not great intellectuals prior to the the Fist War. Economically, the Empire was doing well, especially in new knowledge based industries, and the noveau riche created a market for Modernism, of a somewhat febrile type. After the War, Vienna had a bloated tertiary sector with a tiny economic hinterland.This meant that its artists and thinkers reoriented themselves to export markets- primarily America- thus spreading the myth of a Viennese intellectual culture which never actually existed. One final point, German was an important language for scholars a hundred years ago. Indeed, you couldn't get an Econ PhD from Harvard without knowing German prior to 1960. Vienna presented the Anglo Saxons German scholarship oppositional to that of Berlin. 

Democracy evolved out of the notion that if the people who pay the taxes decide how that money should be spent, then- provided people are rational- tax money will be spent on 'public goods' which enable 'endogenous growth' which involves decentralised innovation and enterprise. Thus the Democracy becomes richer and stronger than its autocratic rivals. Britain became the greatest Imperial power the world has ever seen because, in the Seventeenth Century, it decided to keep the Navy under the control of the tax-payer not the King. Thus the profits from its burgeoning naval might remained in private hands and though there was a lot of corruption, in an emergency, or when an opportunity arose, tax payers would agree- through their elected representatives in Parliament- to pay more in the short run so as to be a lot richer in the long run. India did have 'tribal republics' (janapadas) which had some 'democratic features', however Indian Empires could not be based on a particular tribal identity because of the vastness of the land. It also did have a 'Guild' (Shreni) system whereby merchants and artisans had some countervailing power over monarchs. The same was true of 'caste' brotherhoods (biradaris) more especially those of dominant cultivator castes. Speaking generally, most of India was a segmentary society at the micro-level- i.e. relatively autonomous but highly differentiated- with an overarching, surplus extracting, Imperial administration whose strength fluctuated with economic conditions. India did have some promising 'Prussias'- i.e. tribal/caste based warlike monarchies which might have united the country- but they weren't developing naval power and thus could never really compete with a global naval power. Even China started to succumb because it ignored the navy. Strangely, India continues to neglect its ports and merchant marine which is why, unlike Japan, South Korea and now China, it will remain poor. The Brits could dominate India because the made the profit of exports and imports and also could move troops around by sea. Later they built railways and paid off or crushed internal opposition. Still- like other Empires in India's past- British power was bound to crumble because sooner or later the people wouldn't be able to pay enough tax to finance the Imperial canopy. Thus some far-sighted British administrators wanted to bring representative local government to India so that small towns could gain 'endogenous growth' by taxing themselves for public good provision. In other words, the British saw that some limited democracy at the local level was necessary to prevent the same thing happening to their Empire in India as had happened to the Mughals or to the Portuguese. The Indians did not want to pay taxes in return for having elected representatives who would set a budget. They also did not want to be ruled by anybody. Why? They were suspicious of both 'leaders' and officials. The genius of Mahatma Gandhi was that he promised the Indians an anarchic utopia where there would be no taxes and no officials. Thus, in theory, people could vote for the Congress party without having to pay taxes. However, this also meant that India failed to develop after Independence. In the short run 'begging bowl' diplomacy could give the illusion of progress but longer term it became apparent that the poor can only lift themselves up if they pay a little in tax and elect smart people to decide how to spend it best. 

There's also the march of the Czech (or Czechoslovak) Legion in 1918, after the October Revolution and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The Legion was formed as a unit in the Russian Army composed of Czechs and Slovaks interested in freeing their compatriots from Austro-Hungarian rule. When the Bolsheviks started making peace with the Central Powers, the Czech Legion decided to rejoin the war on the Allied side, which basically meant getting to France. Since getting through the German-controlled Baltic looked dubious, they decided to exit Russia via Vladivostok, in the Siberian Far East. The march started as a retreat in the face of German and Austro-Hungarian forces invading the Ukraine (part of a move to pressure the Bolsheviks into agreeing to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk), and effectively ended 6,000 miles (9,700 kilometers) later in Vladivostok, which makes it a little bit longer than the Long March. All the same, I'm not sure how much of this qualifies as a retreat per se, since for much of the time they were more on the offensive than anything else (seizing control of multiple cities along the railway route, for example). It's probably more an example of a (very extended) march through hostile territory.
