...both sentences describing the distance of the Earth from the Sun are true. Both descriptions are accurate. One description specifies an average distance and the other a range. Note that descriptions of what is empirically verified matching (corresponding to, or, fitting) what actually is (the world) admit of degrees of accuracy, e.g. the statements "the Earth is far away from the Sun" and "the Earth is more than a mile away from the Sun" are both true, i.e. both statements match the case, i.e. both statements fit what is empirically verified, i.e. both statements correspond to the fact(s) of the matter. In short, truth value (either true or false) does not admit of degrees (see non-contradiction and the excluded middle). The manner of describing what is does admit of degrees of precision as well disagreement. The manner of interpreting what is and any attempt at a coherent narrative or explanation of the the case, of course, will admit of even further degrees of imprecision to the point of letting the audience fill in the gaps of the explanation and narrative with their own background for understanding. Much like consciousness contends with "degenerate data" in a cinema and imagines the sequence of flickering still images is representing fluid motion, so to the interpretation of interpretation will admit of greater degrees of imprecision. Considering what the subject matter will allow and tailoring the explanation to such a restrictive boundary is hallmark to distinguishing what is merely a way of looking at the facts (weltanschauung - to be either agreed or disagreed with like so much gossip) from the means to understand the facts in a broader scope (verstehen to be reasoned from for the further advancement of hypotheses) Similar to the distinction of what is true (correspondence of utterance and what is) and what is "true to you" (opinion, sentiment, as well as situational accounting - what was known when, and perspectival accounting - what was observed from which vantage, etc.), it is worth also distinguishing philosophy (i.e. love of wisdom, e.g. respect for obtaining knowledge, e.g. the virtue of not apologizing for confirming empirical verification of falsifiable hypothesis, e.g. rejecting false arguments, e.g. admiration for heuristic aptitude, etc.) from weltanschauung (i.e. "world look", e.g. a world-view, e.g. a way of looking at the world, e.g. an interpretation of events as compared to just the events, e.g. a hermeneutic conclusion, etc.) PRAGMATISM Why bother making these distinctions? Imagine you and some friends were lost in the desert. While walking for days with little water, you might see in the heat what appears to be oasis. The cooler heads among you might prevail and despite your thirst, opt not to investigate each and every mirage as this would quickly leave your carrion jerky. They might even interpret the facts of your situation as better suited to travel at night utilizing celestial navigation to head northward where likely there is civilization. While back at a cafe in a friendly bazaar, you can reflect upon the condition that if coherence of statement and weltanschauung were correspondence and philosophy, then an oasis and a mirage would have epistemic and ontological equivalence, but they do not. Furthermore, it is worth noting as well the rational assessment of the truth value of self-knowledge claims. It may be true to me that "I feel glad" however, there are no means by which this statement can be verified, much less falsified by anyone other than me, therefore, such statements are only a matter of agreement or disagreement. SEMANTICS Also consider semantically irrelevant cases. It is one thing if I am charged with going up a hill to scout an enemy position and am expected to wave my hands furiously if there is an overwhelmingly fortified enemy presence. It is another if I am attacked by a swarm of bees at the top of the hill. Similarly, imagine that you are a student taking an exam in the French language first class of the day. As you shower, you are practicing your language lesson recitals and repeating the phrase, "il pleut". Is this a comment upon microclimate conditions? No. 

You are, of course, merely presenting your view of things. A child can do as much. And as little. Philosophy is not a solicitation to agreement with perspective, world-view, a way of looking at things, points of view or weltanschauung. Philosophy is love of wisdom and so requires knowledge, not opinion, sentiment or belief. 

I recommend you write to Professor John R. Searle of UC Berkeley and request his summary of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. 

For example, if I am taking a shower and reciting French lessons repeating the phrase, "il pleut" this is not necessarily a comment upon micro-climate conditions. Likewise, if I am in despair and say, "Oh, why was I ever born?" offering upon an answer explaining why I was born is entirely beside the point of what was meant by the utterance. Lastly, if I say "I own this car" out of pride of ownership, rather than fact of it, demanding records in support of the claim is, again, irrelevant. Hope that helps. 

For starters: An argument is valid if and only if when all the premises are true, then the conclusion is true. An argument is sound if and only if it is valid and all its premises are true As for the logical form of your example arguments, you could formulate them as syllogisms - where a conclusion is made from two premises, each sharing a term in the conclusion and a term not in the conclusion. Argument #1a) Premise #1) Person X uses a proxy for their web activities. Premise #2) All people who use a proxy for their web activities are hiding something. Conclusion) Person X is hiding something. This is a valid and sound argument, but, only trivially in the sense that proxy servers hide the users ip addy. Note tho that language use (and definition of terms) can be ambiguous. For example, in a trivial sense it does follow that using proxies necessarily entails that you are actually hiding something because the use of a proxy hides your i.p. addy. The implication that you are being deceitful, however, does not necessarily follow from the use of a proxy. Using "hiding something" to conclude deceit as a result of this reasoning would be a deductive fallacy: Argument #1b) Premise #1) Person X uses a proxy for their web activities. Premise #2) All people who use a proxy for their web activities are hiding something. Conclusion) Person X is deceitfully hiding something. And this would be unsound: Argument #1c) Premise #1) Person X uses a proxy for their web activities. Premise #2) All people who use a proxy for their web activities are deceitfully hiding something. Conclusion) Person X is deceitfully hiding something. Argument #2) Premise #1) Person X dyed their hair red. Premise #2) Some people that dye their hair red have trait Y. Conclusion) Person X has trait Y. The argument is not valid as only some and not all people with dyed red hair have trait Y - i.e. it does not follow that "dyeing hair red" entails "trait Y". Note the distinctive uses of "some" and "all" in these two examples. Lastly, I think we can also squeeze your third example argument into a syllogistic form to demonstrate its truth or fallacy: Argument #3a) Premise #1) Person X bought a gun. Premise #2) Some people who buy guns plan crazy violence. Conclusion) Person X is planning crazy violence. Like the second example, it does not follow that Person X necessarily intends crazy violence. If however, premise #2 were true in this reformulation: Argument #3b) Premise #1) Person X bought a gun. Premise #2) All people who buy guns plan crazy violence. Conclusion) Person X is planning crazy violence. ...then the argument would be valid and sound. As for interpreting the combination of Person X's lack of military background, lack of interest in joining the military and interest in researching military tactics... well, I'd recommend studying logistics instead of tactics ;) Hope that helps.
