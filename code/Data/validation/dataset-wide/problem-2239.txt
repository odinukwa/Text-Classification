i.e. it's not necessarily the fourth official who replaces the referee if they become injured. That paragraph pretty much indicates the answer to your question as well: it's covered by the competition rules. You follow whatever procedures are listed in the competition rules, and after that it becomes a "do the best you can, report what happened to the organising body for the competition and let them sort it out" - as happens with any other situation which isn't covered by the rules. 

Therefore both your cases would be a no ball, unless the batsman has played the ball (or it has hit their person). 

When the first batsman reaches the crease, it becomes his ground, and it remains his ground even when the second batsman enters the crease. It doesn't matter if the batsmen crossed or not when running, all that matters is which batsman reached the crease first. If neither batsman had reached the crease when the wicket was put down, then 29.2(c) would apply and it would be the batsman closest to the crease who is out. All the above assumes that the wicket is put down at B's end; if the wicket is put down at A's end, nobody is out as the first batsman to reach the crease is not out as he is in his ground, and the second batsman to reach the crease is not out as his wicket has not been put down (his wicket is at the other end). 

As both teams have won their only game, their strength of victory and strength of schedule are identical. However, the next tiebreaker is now 

It's no different in cricket than in any other sport: it's dangerous for the players, the officials and everyone else involved in the game. 

There's no fundamental difference in the ball or anything else - professional players just have (much) better technique than you or me, so everything just happens much faster, and speed speeds height. 

TL;DR: the good divisional record (at worst 4-2) and excellent conference record for the Chiefs (at worst 9-3) means that they win the tiebreakers over the other relevant teams (Broncos, Jets and Steelers). How the Broncos can miss the playoffs The Broncos lose to both the Bengals and the Chargers, while the Chiefs beat the Raiders. The Chiefs win the AFC West with an 11-5 record, while the Broncos are in the wild card mix with a 10-6 record. At this point, the other important teams are the Jets and the Steelers. The "worst case" scenario for the Broncos is both the Jets and the Steelers winning; in this case, the Jets have an 11-5 record and claim the first wild card spot. The Steelers have the same 10-6 record as the Broncos, but claim the second wild card spot on the basis of their better conference record (7-5 vs 6-6). Why the Chiefs always make the playoffs If the Chiefs win their final match, they are 11-5. At this point, they are either AFC West champions or guaranteed to have one of the two best records of non-champions (the only other non-champion which can possibly get to 11-5 is the Jets), so they are guaranteed a playoff spot. If the Chiefs lose their final match against the Raiders, they have a 10-6 record. If the Broncos have lost their final two matches, the Chiefs are AFC West champions on the basis of their better divisional record (4-2 vs 3-3) as the Broncos and Chiefs split their two matches this year. If the Broncos win one of their final two matches, they are 11-5 and AFC West champions, while the Chiefs are in the wild card mix. The important teams are once again the Jets and the Steelers - if they both win, the Jets again claim the first wild card spot at 11-5, and the Steelers are at 10-6. The Chiefs win the tiebreaker on the basis of their better conference record (9-3 vs 7-5). A similar analysis applies if the Jets lose. 

Preferred lies are a local rule, so you would need to refer to the exact wording of the rule as posted. However, if your committee is using either the R&A's or the USGA's suggested wording (e.g. from pages 128-129 of the R&A's Rules of Golf - the USGA copy is identical apart from branding), then this states: 

As you can see from the full play-by-play of the game, the hit by Albert Almora Jr. was a ground-rule double. This is due to the ground rule at Wrigley Field that any ball which lodges in the ivy is automatically a double, so the play was dead. The umpires were (as is almost always the case) completely correct. 

As such, B is perfectly entitled to play the ball as shown in both your diagrams. In your top diagram, A is also entitled to play the part of the ball which is on their side of the net - this could lead to a simultaneous contact which is covered by Rule 9.1.2 if you want the details. In your second diagram, A is playing the ball outside their own playing area, so will commit a fault if they actually touch the ball (or player B). Quoting Rule 11.4.1, which lists the faults a player may commit at the net: 

In the history of cricket, probably, yes in some club match somewhere. I am not aware of any such incidents in professional cricket history though. 

As noted in the Guardian article you've linked to, UEFA's "control, ethics and disciplinary body" decided that the last 18 seconds must be replayed. As noted in the same article, FIFA ordered that an entire match be replayed in 2005 after a referee made exactly the same error. 

The first thing to note here is that this is almost exclusively an NBA only issue; FIBA rules have always penalised away from the ball fouls as unsportsmanlike fouls giving two free throws and possession; quoting from Article 37, Unsportsmanlike foul: 

The following runner in your scenario is the batter-runner, so the force is removed as soon as the first baseman steps onto the base. 

The viscosity of water decreases with temperature - this means that swimming is quicker in warmer water. As such, FINA regulations require that 

As you can see from the results, there was no "winner of every heat qualifies" rule; it was simply the fastest 16 swimmers which went through to the semi-finals - note how all the semi-final qualifiers came from heats 7, 8, 9 and 10 (which were loaded to have the fastest swimmers). You could view this as being a exhibition heat, as there was no realistic chance that anyone from it was going to get into the semi-finals - however, you could also argue that it was better for the sport to have Moussambani competing against swimmers closer to his skill level, rather than tailing in very, very last against some of the best swimmers in the world. 

As with much of this stuff, this is explicitly covered in the Laws of the Game. In this case, Law 1 The Field of Play, Goalposts (page 9): 

If the movement was a deliberate attempt to distract the striker, it would be covered by Law 41.4 and result in penalty runs. 

Somewhat confusingly under FIBA rules, a jump ball situation does not result in a jump ball, but instead teams alternating possession on a throw-in (12.5.1): 

There is no Law which specifies this, with the possible exception of anything to do with obstructing the field; the Laws of Cricket are in fact remarkably vague on what the striker may and may not do - it's self regulating by the fact that doing anything "strange" (e.g. standing half way down the pitch) will generally result in the batsman getting out very quickly. 

Those quotes from either the FIVB Beach Volleyball Rules 2015-2016 or the FIVB Indoor Rules 2015-2016; the wording and numbering is identical between the two rule books. The difference between the two rule sets comes in how strictly the rules are interpreted with the beach interpretations generally being much stricter. 

but this rule does not exist in the current rules. (Note that "game" in this context means "frame" rather than "match"). Neither of these rule sets (nor the 2009-2014 rules) include the stipulation that a player on the black does not receive two visits, so you're going to have to ask your tournament organiser. 

No, the batsman is not out. Law 29.1.1 defines the situations in which the wicket is considered to be put down: 

If the wicketkeeper cleanly broke the stumps, then the batsman is out - it doesn't matter what happens next add the ball is dead. Aside: it certainly can't be hit wicket as that explicitly can only happen when playing a stroke or setting of for a first run. Aside 2: other than in exceptional circumstances, there's no reason a batsman should be running at the wicket - if a batsman did influence the play by doing so, for example by distracting the wicketkeeper, they would be very much at risk of being given out for obstructing the field. 

The obvious answer here is "ask your coach". If they can't tell you how to be a better athlete, then they're not the right coach for you no matter how good their technical volleyball coaching might be. 

(my emphasis). However, that's not really the question you're asking here, which is "was the action of the middle blocker on team A a block or an attack hit?". For this, refer to Rule 14.1.1: 

In terms of the match, it has been abandoned so there is currently no result. What happens next is a question for the governing body controlling your games - they will gather evidence from the involved parties and make a decision as to what happens in the longer term - they will almost certainly have the right to do almost anything, up to and including expelling offending clubs from the tournament. For specific details, you'll have to read the exact regulations for the tournament you're playing in. 

The duties of the scorers are covered by Law 3 - but note that this does not include any "technical equipment" or "display". At least within the letter of the Laws, it is perfectly permissible for the score to be recorded only on pieces of paper. The reason that the Laws don't go into the details of the match referee or the coach is because neither are required for a match. For example, in the Laws of the Game, the toss is overseen by one or both umpires (Law 13.4): 

I see no reason the accuracy would dip exponentially. That's a phrase with a very specific mathematical meaning, and I don't see a mechanism here that would produce an exponential change in the accuracy. 

I don't believe anyone keeps records for that short a period. To quote from recordholders.org, referring to the number of push-ups in one minute: 

Firstly, note that the IIHF rules (on the left in your image) include "an Automatic Game Misconduct or a Match penalty". Both of those result in the player taking no further part in the match, so fighting isn't allowed under IIHF rules. Therefore I think your question should really be "Why is fighting tolerated in the NHL?" The answer to that one is because sport is entertainment, and there is a long-term belief that fans want to see fights. While some more recent studies show that the effect is perhaps neutral, fighting is a part of hockey traditions. This Guardian article probably captures it correctly: 

is incorrect. The runner may have reached home base before the out was made, but no run is scored. Quoting from Rule 5.08: 

As the Cricbuzz scorecard you've linked to indicates, this was a bit of a strange situation in that the Indian Women continued to bat after reaching their target of 107 runs - basically at this point it had turned into a practice match, so a couple of the Indian women retired to let the rest of the team have a go. 

What would you have? People jumping from one country to another on a whim? The eligibility requirements often mean that players are qualified to play for more than one country (due to grandparents, etc) - would you have (e.g.) Kevin Pietersen playing for England in the first Test Match of a series, then playing for South Africa in the next Test? As the cycle between World Cups and the like, four years is a reasonable amount of time which means that a player has truly moved from one country to another, and isn't just playing for whichever flag of convenience will happen to pay them the most this week. 

Free hits are not part of the Laws of Cricket, but instead part of the playing conditions for various tournaments, so it is not possible to give a generic answer to this question. However, a dismissal does not stop the free hit from occurring under the current ODI or T20 International playing conditions. 

At least under the standard Laws of Cricket (specifically, Law 42.6 and 42.7), it's a No ball as soon as it passes the batsmen, so it doesn't matter that it hit the wicket - it's still a No ball and therefore the batsman cannot be out bowled. 

That's a question for the regulations of any particular tournament / organising body - but in general, the competition committee or equivalent has very wide-ranging powers to ensure that the game is played fairly. 

TL;DR: you're not playing under any even reasonably recent version of the English Pool Association rules, so we can't answer the question. Under current English Pool Association rules (which are the same as the World Eight Ball Pool Association Rules), a foul when the black is "on" still results in the opponent receiving two visits to the table. A foul results in a loss of frame only if the black ball is potted. Under the old EPA rules (pre-2009), 

There's nothing specific to cover this situation. However, it would almost certainly count both as bringing the game into disrepute, thus meaning the player would be subject to a charge from the appropriate governing body, and gross misconduct, thus meaning the player would be subject to summary dismissal. The latter in particular would be an employment matter rather than a sporting one and hence very dependent on the exact legal jurisdiction. 

Better just to have one delay before the third shot, rather than three delays. Note 1: admittedly a small delay in the case of professional teams, but there are a lot of free throws in the game. It's all going to add up. 

Something works You're playing to win (see akadian's answer for the issues here), and You're not interested in moving up to a higher standard of play 

(again, my emphasis). This makes it clear that it doesn't matter if the batsman hits the ball or not - if the ball would have passed above shoulder height, it counts as one of the bouncers for the over. Exactly the same language exists in the Twenty20 regulations, for what it's worth. 

The penalty specified in Art 31.3 then applies, which is basically "the basket counts". NBA rules are effectively the same but with different wording. 

In theory, a truly undrafted player can sign with anyone. However, your scenario is never going to happen - even if a player states that they'd only play for one team, it's still advantageous for another team to draft them (at which point they have exclusive rights to the player) and then trade them. If an acknowledged good player like Lonzo Ball went through the entire draft without being drafted, there's clearly some collusion going on, and the commissioner is going to get involved really quickly. 

This sounds like a decision to prioritise game time and fun over the hard graft of practice. This is a valid decision for you to make, but it's probably not the decision which is going to make you the best player you can be in the long run. 

As you've noted, the most common way for this to occur is a run out while attempting a second (or later) run, but there are a number of other ways: 

No - penalty runs don't cause a change in the on-strike batsman, just as a no ball or wide doesn't. The normal change of bowling end then happens, and the non striker then becomes the on-strike batsman. This is covered (or more precisely, not covered) by Law 41(3) which makes no mention of the batsmen changing ends due to the award of penalty runs. 

Tiebreakers are much, much more common. The only sets which are advantage sets are the final set in singles at the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, the Olympic tennis tournament and the Federation Cup; see the advantage set definition at Wikipedia. 

which was frankly a bit bonkers. For a less extreme example, see Mike McCarthy's attempted challenge against the Vikings in 2012. That was a similar situation, except that McCarthy threw his flag after the official replay had begun, so the replay happened and gave the Packers a touchdown. The Packers still got a a 15 yard penalty on the kickoff though. In the 2013 offseason, the NFL got rid of the rule that hammered the Lions because everybody agreed it was a bit silly.
