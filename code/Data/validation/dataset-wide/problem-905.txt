Hughes' The Crow is regarded partly as an attack on Christianity, where both the Wasteland and Four Quartets can be understood as an attempt to reconcile Western and Eastern religious ideals. (Specifically Christianity and Hinduism.) 

Tiling patterns have a very ancient history, and Borges was no doubt drawing on this. The point of hexagons is that they pack perfectly, with no spaces in between. 

The confusion comes from Whitman's using a (now archaic) word form. I don't know to what degree Whitman's specific choice "atomies" was standard in his time, but Whitman is generally considered a poet of the first rank, and poets are allowed to invent words and engineer novel usage. (Often, those two capabilities are marks of the greatest poets. Shakespeare was the most fertile because he was writing during the first period of what came to be modern English.) 

My personal feeling is that poetry is defined by form more than content, because even doggerel is a low form of poetry. I'd say that Wikipedia extends the definition a bit too far with the requirement that poetry "evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning" because it's quite possible to write perfect verse with no deeper meaning. You might find Robert Graves' definition from the White Goddess to be of some interest: 

It's also worth looking at another famous source on Eros/Cupid, which is Plato, in The Symposium and Phaedrus. There you'll find allegory for Eros and Psyche (body and soul), and reference to wings. Derrida wrote about the φάρμακον (pharmakon) in relation to this subject—pharmakon can be medicine or poison, and shares a common root with the word for a sacrificial victim and poisoner. Death again comes up in relation to this topic: 

My feeling is that all 4 Johns you mention are very positive and admirable characters. Usklass was certainly graced, as a foundling who rose to become a supreme King. Likewise, Strange, Segundus, and Childermass are all fairly graced. John Barleycorn is worth looking at, as he is a very famous figure in English paganism. 

Insofar as there is a main character in the Expanse series, it is Holden. Holden represents a sort of idealized, middle-American stock, where middle-American refers to the heartland. (Very similar to James Tiberias Kirk's Iowan roots.) Miller also occupies a more central role than other characters, and I believe he is also Caucasian. Holden's centrality, I believe, provides the core of the ethnic representation your are musing on. As I recall, it is usually he (and Miller) who are describing other characters. Thus, they may naturally be focusing on differences, and not feel the need for describing the ethnicity of their own stock. 

Don't forget that, towards the end of his life, Checkov declared his plays farces and they are undoubtedly comic, which accounts for their bittersweet quality. Most great tragedy contains comic elements, either wordplay or irony, but Checkov merges the two forms better than most. 

Here we have wings, we have a sacrificial bride, the breeze (Zephyr figures in the story of the sister's death, which involves being carried by the wind), and love at first sight. I don't know if Apuleius is consciously referencing that passage of Ovid's, but Ovid's Metamorphosis is so influential, it's almost impossible not to. Scholars seem to agree: Ovid in Apuleius' Metamorphoses A Book-like self. Ovid and Apuleius A Comparison of Ovid and Apuleius as Story-Tellers Ovid even uses the term "cupidi" in this section: 

I take this from context of this particular verse, Voice of the Rain, and because the idea is established at the outset of Leaves of Grass: 

I feel like there are two questions here. (1) Does English language break down into metrical feet and (2) are metrical feet used in English poetry. The American Poetry Foundation defines a foot as a measurement of accentual-syllabic meter, which is just a way of saying English speech regards stresses and syllables distinctly. The breaking up of large rhythmic structures into feet is natural. In analysis of poems with strongly regularized rhythm, feet are used to determine the normative meter. We can apply them to Blake, which will comment on the Coleridge question, and highlight the potential ambiguity in metrical interpretation. Specifically, the second stanza of Blake's London can be delivered variously in conjunction with the normative Iambic Tetrameter of the poem: 

I think your self-answer is correct. The application of the division of feet can have a degree of subjectivity--ultimately it doesn't matter where you divide the foot because the line will still have the same number of stresses to syllables. That said, in heavily regularized verse, the method is used to determine the normative meter, and it's helpful to have some standardization. 

I suspect Zeffirelli was commenting on the transition between boyhood and adulthood in the context of consequences, and how easily a simple mistake can have severe implications. (Compare to teens drunk driving--it's all fun and games until someone dies.) Zeffirelli's scene is played as teenage boy, full of bluster, having fun in the traditional male pastime busting on their rivals. The fatal blow is sudden and unexpected. Reality and adulthood comes crashing down, just like it will for Romeo and Juliet. Despite the extravagant staging of the Luhrmann, the reality of the teens he presents is much more serious. John Leguizamo's portrayal of Tybalt, as I recall, is much more straightforward, focusing on his rage and viciousness. It's possible Luhrmann was commenting on gang culture of the time, but more likely that his choice for the scene is in service of a very straightforward adaptation focused on the raw passion of youth. 

These horses were supernatural, reputedly the offspring of a harpy and the west wind, thus difficult to manage for mortals, save noble Patrochlus, who used to feed and groom them for Achilles. 

This is a tough question. Eliot, in particular, demonstrated the primacy of meter over rhyme in Four Quartets. (Rhyme is generally considered to be the primary mnemonic device, a critical element in that poems are traditionally meant to be recited, but that particular poem shows that meter alone serves the function quite well.) Rap, the most popular and vital form of modern poetry, heavily utilizes rhyme, but sophisticated meter still seems to be the distinguisher of the best work. After Duchamp and the Beats, a lot of people seemed to decide poetry was anything one called poetry, which led to a lot of very poor "verse", but I'd make the case that even free verse, if it's any good, has impeccable meter. Maxwell Anderson was quite unequivocal on the subject of form: 

It's important to note that the poem is only nominally addressed to the celestial Tyger--more practically, it is addressed to the "child" listening to the poem, who, by device, becomes associated with the fierce Tyger. (Child may be understood in the sense of "children of god", not specifically relating to chronological age, although part of what makes this one of the most famous poems in English is it's universality, and suitability for literal children.) The association with the Tyger is an indication that we all contain these dualities. So what Blake is suggesting, as opposed to merely asking, is that the same creator made both the hunter and the prey, and that both have their place in the grand scheme. I have no doubt there are other valid interpretations, and more complex and nuanced analyses, but here I have attempted to shed light on the most simple interpretations, which do not require deep knowledge of Blake's ideas. The ability to interpret this poem simply is a factor in the genius of Blake's in regard to Innocence & Experience. 

It all falls under the theme of the "mind forged manacles", which is the key line in the poem, thematically and rhythmically. SEE ALSO: The Garden of Love 

The Wasteland is about spiritual emptiness in an industrialized society still reeling from the carnage of World War I. Eliot presents purgatorial imagery--an unreal city devoid of sunlight occupied by the living dead, spiritually exhausted (eyes fixed upon their feet as opposed to the heavens[A]), streaming across a bridge on their way to work. King William Street is key--this is the historical center of the London banking district. The deadening bells of St Mary Woolnoth deepen choice--Eliot is presenting a church enforcing the strictures of an industry that is the opposite of religion[B], focused entirely on worldly gain, absent remorse. Blake's London is partly about self-enslavement, partly about dehumanization in an industrial society, and Garden of Love is about the inversion of love in the context of religion. Baudelaire's Au Lecteur, upon which this section ends, is the most obvious referent:
