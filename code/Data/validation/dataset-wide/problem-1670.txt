Alright, this question stays in the top list, because nobody has "answered" it. So let's see. According to this article: Rs 2000 Currency Note With Nano GPS Chip – Hoax or Not? 

He also gave me a link to a page that shows the house and what the chaplan actually wrote: Slessorium Here's how the house looks like: 

This artifact was found in Mezin, Ukraine. Many details of the excavation site can be found here. There are also illustrations of the bird figurine. The BBC article on the topic can be found here: Reclaiming the Swastika It says at example 5, the bird: 

Just recently, researchers in Japan were able to use existing data of earthquakes and the lunar phases to show a relationship between tidal stress and probability of large earthquakes. From the excerpt, published in Nature Geoscience: Earthquake potential revealed by tidal influence on earthquake size–frequency statistics 

I traced where I see a Swastika. The Swastika we all know is the red one. I kept tracing a bit more of the palaeolithic artist's work in green where I could make out the carving. It is still a Swastika in my book, just a bit more fancy. I stand by my answer: Yes, there is scientific evidence that the swastika is over 11,000 years old. 

Is the claim that the Swastika is over 11,000 years old backed by scientific evidence? Yes, there is archaeological evidence of at least one Swastika being at least 12,000 years old. BBC Article Photo 

So basically, yes, the moon can cause big earthquakes on earth, or make small earthquakes bigger. And the effect is measurable. They are not mentioning "super-moon" phases there, and I don't have access to the paper. Since the pull is strongest in this phase, I think it's safe to say that the probability of large earthquakes is higher than usual at this time. This is how I interpret the excerpt. Also, I'm not a Geoscientist. Why is the moon's pull strongest the closer it comes to earth? Because the gravitational force between two objects is a formula of their masses and the distance between them. F = G * M * m / R ^ 2 R is the distance between the objects. If they get closer to each other, R decreases. When the denominator decreases, the resulting Force increases. I found an online tool that calculates the gravitational force: Newton Law of Gravity Calculation I actually put the numbers in to see what the difference in force really is between the Apogee (furthest distance between moon and earth) and Perigee (closest distance). The gravitational force is 30% stronger at Perigee than at Apogee. Type in the values and test it yourself. The Japanese researchers figured out that large earthquake probability is higher when the moon causes maximum "tidal stress". When is this tidal stress the strongest? When the moon pulls strongest. There will be less tidal stress on the side of earth where the moon doesn't pull and more tidal stress on the side of earth that faces the moon. At least this is the only way that makes sense to me. By the way, today, the 14/11/2016 is the Perigee of this year. 

Quite the contrary. Current neuroscience research aims to build models of cognition, including consciousness (subjective experience, awareness, wakefulness, etc.). To some extent, sensation has been dealt with, but perception is more complex and cognition even more so. 

It is true - the process is called habituation. It depends on how frequent (odor exposure [or sniffs] per minute) a smell is registered. Habituation can last from less than ten minutes up to at least 30 minutes (Chaudhury et al., 2010). As mentioned in the link, different parts of the olfactory system appear to be involved, but it is mainly explained through receptor activation on the cell membrane of neurons. There is a limited number of receptors that wait for signaling molecules or odorants (odor molecules) to attach, much like the game musical chairs. Habituation is thought to be more a product of receptor activity at neurons that transfer the information than sensory neurons that receive the odorants. With time, receptors go back to their original states. Whether this differs by scents depends on several factors. There is great variation in individual scent acuity (see Kandel et al., Principles of Neural Science (5th ed.), ch. 32) from human to human, but frequency of exposure is a likely candidate, as well as salience - how strongly a smell affects us. We are more sensitive to smells that provide an evolutionary benefit by promoting survival, such as the smell of a burning forest. Perhaps habituation is less likely if it does us more harm than good. 

The heart is well-known to affect the brain and vice versa. Heart-rate variability correlates with activity in the prefrontal cortex and with working memory performance. Changing hearts changes minds. To my knowledge there is, however, no neuroscientific evidence for memory processes in the heart. There are obvious indications that the spinal cord has a simple procedural memory. Consider a headless chicken running. Evidence for heart-related amnesia would be more convincing than introduced memories. There is not enough data to exclude that "embodied cognition" is realized in long-term memory formation throughout neurons. However, the best explanation points toward a different physiological responsiveness of the transplanted heart. If viewed from a perspective of an extended memory system that includes both heart and brain, then the quality of the feedback varies with the properties of the heart (However, brains are more different than hearts - the brain form has a high variance.) Experiments have demonstrated that listening to an artificial heart beat at different speeds affect moral reasoning, so a bidirectional relationship is hard to rule out. The general consensus in neuroscience is that the brain is responsible for episodic (events) and declarative (facts etc.) memory. 

You can see the chip here. It's small, but not flat enough to be integrated in paper money. The average banknote has a thickness of 0.11mm No, banknotes cannot be tracked with GPS. In addition to this, the value of GPS trackers that size would exceed the denomination of the note. Even if it was possible at this time, no country would do it. People would get the banknotes, remove the chips and sell them. 

I share the museum staff's judgement that the important part about metres and feet should not be taken literally. The guy was clearly just making fun. This is a rhetoric structure many people use when something didn't turn out to be the way they expected. And most certainly, the doors and windows are not enormous. It is a nice anecdote, for sure. But I think this one is busted. 

I could not find a study specifically about safe owners, but I don't see why human behaviour would be different when it comes to creating and remembering a password/combination of digits, when applied in a similar context, like safes. There is lots of anecdotal evidence about this writing down of passwords of course. I remember Richard Feynman writing about his experience as a hobbyist safe cracker when he discovered this behaviour. He would look for a written down password at the sides of the drawers. At the places I worked, with IT people, unfortunately, writing down passwords was quite common. I saw Post Its on screens with several passwords and user names. If you asked people to not do that, those notes would not vanish but move to another "hidden" place on or under the desk. My bet is that people anywhere at all times wrote down passwords. When a secret message travelled through the Roman Empire and arrived at a secretary, I'm pretty sure that guy had the code to decipher the message carved into the side of his clipboard. So yes, with the research paper at hand showing that people write down passwords, I go ahead and say it is very likely that safe owners do it too, because it's the same concept. I know this doesn't prove that they keep the note in the same room, I haven't found a study on that. 

No control group Small sample size (15 participants) Study period is too short (6 months) and too little measurements are taken (baseline, +3 months, +6 months) Effects are not very distinct, especially since the markers used in the study (i.e. Viral load, CD4, and CD8) naturally varies anyway There are a number of participants who developed AIDS during the study, one who takes coconut oil actually died shortly after the study finished One of the participant doesn't even appear to actually have HIV, at least during the study period The paper is too short, it doesn't describe the controls used in the study or the amount of time the patients have had HIV. 

Sleep follows a certain cycle which repeats throughout the night. Being forced to wake up when in the deep sleep stage (N3) usually leads to you being more tired for the rest of the day (although usually it only last for an hour at most). This is known as sleep inertia. Day time short nap doesn't work the same because you woke up before you reach the deep sleep stage. This kind of short nap is called power napping. Sleep cycle is not considered controversial among people who studied sleep, and is backed by EEG scans which shows that the different stages have different brain wave pattern. Some relevant researches showing sleep inertia: 

Surprisingly though, given how often I've heard this claim, I hadn't been able to find much serious researches regarding this topic. Are there any truth to this claim? Does watering plants with rice water produces better plants than watering plants with plain tap water? How does it compare with regular, commercially produced fertilizers? 

There seems often to be an implicit assumption in the minds of many people that most trolls are children or teenagers or generally in the younger demographics. Such as this unsourced claim on this article: 

Is there any sort of truth to this? Is there any evidence that shows the demographic of trolls to be any different than the demographic of normal internet users (esp. age; race, gender, and economic status are also interesting topics to discuss but please focus this question on age)? Is young internet users more predisposed to trolling than older people? 

Essay on the Relevance for the Australian Census Having answered the question by exposing the facts, I now turn to the essay, since the question has been asked in the context of the Australian census—to which one can have but opinions, whether informed or not. The history of statistics is sadly plagued with eugenicists (e.g. Francis Galton, R. A. Fisher, and Karl Pearson). Today, however, statistics is the hallmark of science, from doctors and psychologist to astronomers and quantum physicists, it is a ubiquitous instrument. Increasingly, data is becoming open. Methods and procedures are becoming open. Some governments have web pages, others shut the internet down. Informed consent is the guiding ethical principle for human research. It is a descendant principle from the Nuremberg Code ($URL$ and the Declaration of Helsinki - in the wake of the war. The crimes of the Nazis lead to increased ethical awareness, but insufficiently so. The Tuskegee syphilis experiment was carried out by the U.S. Public Health Service (involving the minority of African-American heritage) and lasted until 1972, but still resonates this decade. The way forward is to perform a cost benefit analysis for the people. Perhaps stronger encryption laws for personal data are required to protect privacy. Perhaps ethnicity should not be registered. Perhaps the relationship between certain diseases and socioeconomic status can help research and thus society forward. What are the pros and cons of census versus privacy? In the case of the 1933 and 1939 censuses, they were also used in modern times to identify the rightful owners of Jewish companies and properties that were attained under the Nazi rule, as was described by Das Bundesarchiv (2011). Finally, a trained skeptic should recognize when comparisons with Nazism are relevant and when they are nothing but a fallacy: reductio ad Hitlerum. I strongly believe, that the often occurring comparisons with Nazi Germany do not only downplay the uniqueness of the holocaust - the worst genocide of modern times - but also belittle those with a heritage of suffering.
