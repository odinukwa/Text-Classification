where $Bew$(#P) means that the formula $P$ with Gödel number #P is provable. Other than Leon Henkin's application to show that Santa Claus exists (also see here), Michael Detlefsen wrote about limitations of mechanism which I do not have a copy but I did read through a refutation of it here. (Note: The first page of Detlefsen's paper can be accessed here). Additionally, Drucker mentions Kripke's 1967 "new proof" of the theorem here. My question is has there been any other interesting non-trivial applications of the theorem other than the cited ones? 

Full ezine article Here is the arXiv paper. Are there any similar cases? EDIT: Peter Suber has a description of the case on the famous Paradox of Court here. 

I have the following book and deals with all the topics you mentioned in addition to Conformal Field Theory for a layman's perspective. $URL$ 

The following paper will be a good starting point if by modern mathematical point of view you take in consideration topology and group theory, where it discusses how Beethoven's Ninth Symphony makes a torus and "chord progression" is a path on it: Music and Mathematics by Thomas M. Fiore. Edit: Since the term modern is so broad with no specific field specified, you may also be interested in use of stochastic approaches in algorithmic composition as used by Xenakis: 

A new book titled Math on Trial: How Numbers Get Used and Abused in the Courtroom was published on March 12, 2013 that exclusively seems to address this question. It may not involve "rigorous proofs" but the book contains cases where math was (ab)used. Here's the blurb from Amazon: 

Motivation: Loius Pojman mentions in What Can We Know? (2001) of a certain Carneades (ca. 214-129 B.C>) who must have been a "remarkable dialectician"because " in 155BC he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Rome and in his spare time he gave two lectures. On first day he eulogized justice, making a profound impression on his audience. To their amazement on the second day he gave a diatribe against justice, arguing that there were equally good reasons for not adopting it". Research yielded the Carneades argumentation framework. However I am interested in the more recent ones. Here's one: 

Dan Bernstein has developed an algorithm which might be relevant to your situation. Bernstein - Enumerating solutions to p(a)+q(b)=r(c)+s(d). $URL$ The algorithm explained in the paper has been very successful in counting solutions to equations of the given type. Admittedly your equation is not exactly of the form considered in the paper, but you might be able to adapt his algorithm to your setting. I vaguely remember that one essentially creates a list of all possible values on both sides then compares these lists looking for matches. Bernstein however does something clever with heaps which saves on the storage space. 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \geq 0$. Let $X$ be a smooth Fano variety over $k$ and let $\ell \neq p$ be a prime. 

There were quite a few different questions, so forgive me if my answer is somewhat fragmented. The Néron-Severi group $NS(X)$ (divisors modulo algebraic equivalence) is finitely generated over any field for any non-singular projective variety $X$, this is Severi's theorem of the base (at least for the case of characteristic zero). In what follows however I am assume that the variety is defined over $\mathbb{C}$ for simplicity. Some answers to your other questions: 

Since nobody has answered this yet, here is my attempt, however Im not sure if it is exactly what you want. Hopefully it will at least lead you to a solution of your problem if you have not seen this kind of stuff already. If your curve $C$ is defined over a field $k$ in which $f(x)$ splits as $f(x)=f_1(x)f_2(x)$, then we can define $C'$ via: $$C': y_1^2 = f_1(x) , y_2^2 = f(x).$$ Then the natural map $(x,y_1,y_2) \mapsto (x,y_1y_2)$ extends to an étale map on the compactifications. However your question asks for $C'$ to "be written in terms of $x$ and $y$". If by this you mean present an affine patch of $C'$ which is a subset of $\mathbb{A}^2$, then $C'$ is at least birational to such an expression by the primitive element theorem and this shouldn't be too hard to write down - however it might be singular. I hope this helps. 

I hope this is well known, I just could not work it out myself. Say I have a variety X (smooth and projective over C is my usual setup) with a smooth subvariety Z. Let f: BL_Z(X) --> X be the blowup of X with centre Z and let E be the exceptional. 

The question might be a bit vague. Certainly there are excellent references online on stability conditions. The first which comes to mind is the most elementary and is by Arend Bayer. If you are already familiar with all of that, these notes by Daniel Huybrechts go deeper into the subject. These are notes from a lecture series delivered in Cambridge, which was recorded on video. Also, I find the original paper by Bridgeland quite readable. 

Where $H^i_\bullet$ is the cohomology with respect to the t-structure $\bullet$. The point of the spectral sequence is that you can filter E in two ways, according to A or to B and then A. 

I am trying to understand Remark 11.3 in Huybrechts's amazing book on derived categories (FM transforms in AG). He starts with smooth projective varieties $j\colon Y \subset X$ and aims to describe the local ext groups $\underline{Ext}^i(j_*O_Y,j_*O_Y)$ in terms of $\wedge^i N$ where $N$ is the normal bundle of $Y$ in $X$. To describe this, he mentions a morphism $\wedge^k \underline{Ext}^1(j_*O_Y,j_*O_Y) \to \underline{Ext}^k(j_* O_Y, j_* O_Y)$ which he calls cup product (or composition). 

The following is apparently a theorem of Serre (which can be found in his FAC paper, although I haven't spotted it $URL$ Let's say that a graded module is torsion if it's zero for all degrees high enough. Let R be a commutative graded ring generated in dimension one. Denote Gr the category of graded R-modules and Tors the subcategory of torsion modules (which is a Serre subcategory). Then the quotient category Gr/Tors is equivalent (through the ~ construction) to the category of quasi-coherent modules on Proj R. I believe that when R is noetherian then this equivalence restricts to one between finitely generated graded modules and coherent modules. (presumably there is also a relative version of this -- but I am quite allergic to Proj so I'm not going to go any further on this) 

This is quite a brief answer as I am not quite sure your question is appropriately phrased for this site, but one can use the "Brauer-Manin obstruction" to show the non-existence of rational points, even if the variety is everywhere locally soluble. Try searching google - in particular papers by Colliot-Thélène, Sansuc, Harari, Swinnerton-Dyer, Skorobogatov and many others. I'm not quite sure if this classifies as "truely global" according to your definition, as the method works by cutting out a certain subset of the adèles which contains the set of rational points, and the adèles are built out of all the completions of the number field. However in my opinion I would certainly say that it is a global method and the general set-up of how it works relies on results from global class field theory. 

As requested, I'm upgrading my comments to an answer. In fact one can even show something stronger for your surface: there is no finite collection of rational maps $\phi_i:\mathbb{P}^2 \to X$ such that $X(ℚ)$ lies in the image of the union of the $\phi_i(\mathbb{ℙ}^2(ℚ))$. To see this, we note that $X$ satisfies so-called weak weak approximation. This follows from the fact that the Brauer group of $X$ modulo constants is finite, and that the Brauer-Manin obstruction is only obstruction to weak approximation for $X$ (this being a theorem of Skorobogatov and Salberger) The union of the $\phi_i(\mathbb{ℙ}^2(ℚ))$ is a thin set, by definition, but the rational points on X are not thin as X satisfies weak weak approximation by a theorem of Ekedahl, cf. the discussion in $URL$ This property should hold more generally for any (geometrically) rationally connected non-rational smooth projective variety $X$ over a number field (the same argument applies in this case, assuming Colliot-Thélène's conjecture that the Brauer-Manin obstruction is the only one to weak approximation). 

I'm trying to understand the relationship between the different models of del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$. Let $k$ be a field of characteristic not equal to $2$. Usually, del Pezzo surfaces of degree $2$ are considered as hypersurfaces of degree $4$ in $\mathbb{P}(1,1,1,2)$: $$S: \quad w^2 = f(x,y,z)$$ with $\deg f = 4$. There are however other natural models, such as hypersurfaces of bidegree $(2,2)$ in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^2$: $$q(s,t,x,y,z) = 0,$$ where $q$ is bihomogeneous of degree (2,2) in $(s,t)$ and $(x,y,z)$, respectively. Call these models of type $1$ and $2$, respectively. I'm trying to understand how one goes between these different models. 

I don't know of a uniform way to prove it for all curves. For elliptic curves it follows from Hodge theory and for the rest it's a consequence of the Bondal-Orlov theorem. It's all explained in Huybrechts's excellent book on Fourier-Mukai transforms. 

Is there a structure theorem for such varieties? If X is a smooth and proper/projective variety whose canonical bundle $\omega_X$ has finite order in the Picard group, do we know anything about X? EDIT: As was pointed out in the comments, if $\omega_X^n = O_X$ then one can find a cycling covering of order n, $Y \to X$, with $\omega_Y = O_Y$. So the problem reduces to understanding varieties with trivial canonical bundle. I'll leave the question as is for a few days more, in case someone else wants to contribute. If nothing happens I will delete it. 

presumably the reason there is an equality in 3.25 instead of an isomorphism is that you don't want $V_K$ to be abstractly isomorphic to $W$, but you want them to be equivalent subschemes of $X_K$ (ie isomorphic in the category of pairs (scheme, embedding)). At least that's how I would interpret it, but I might be wrong. Also, take $X = P^N$. Saying that $W \subset X_K$ is defined over $k$ means precisely that you can find equations cutting out $X_K$ with coefficients in at most $k$. 

Given a(n $\infty$-)category, there is a process called "stabilitazion" which spits out a stable $\infty$-category (as one can read about in either Higher Algebra or the nlab). The famous example is Spectra, which is the stabilization of Top (and I guess the various enhancements of derived categories, out of categories of modules). If I start instead with the plain old category of pointed sets, what is its stabilization? And if I start with finite pointed sets? 

This is somewhat sad, but I think (part of) what we've learned from the whole triangulated-vs-dg story is the following pseudo-statement: the bare category of functors Fun(D(X),D(Y)) is the wrong thing to take -- it should be replaced the category D(X x Y). There is a nice example, due to the usual Bondal-Orlov-Bridgeland people (Example 6.5 in Caldararu's notes), which illustrates this perfectly. Thus, if you find something weird happening in Fun(D(X),D(Y)) you shouldn't be discouraged -- it's not your fault. Of course, there are big names in the field (Canonaco and Stellari to name two) who might disagree with my initial pseudo-statement. It really depends on what you care about.
