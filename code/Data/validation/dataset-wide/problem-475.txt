Don't over do it. If you over tighted your front or back QR, you can squeeze the bearings too much and cause damage -- unless you left your bearing adjustment slightly loose to compensate. You can experiment by using your QR in the wheel with washers on each end, instead of inside the fork of the bike. On the other hand, you don't want front or rear too loose; I was attacked by dogs one time and when I stood up to pedal, I locked the rear tire against the chain stay. My normal position of the clamp is 90 degrees from the bike when it gets snug - then squeeze all the way in. It should be enough to leave an impression in your hand but not enough to damage your bearings. 

Dogs are territorial. Get out of its territory. I have tried spraying and missed, swinging my pump and missed, and each time almost wrecked. If I'm not fast enough, I just get off my bike and walk out its/their territory while using my bike as a shield. 

Because of a herniated disc in my lower back, I was forced to NOT PULL with my hands on steeps. Surprisingly, I found that by concentrating all of my energy below my belt, I could climb much better and faster. This was definitely a "lemonade from lemons" kind of discovery. Try this and see if it helps. 

Years ago I used SPD pedals and I really liked the increased performance, especially with the "scraping the mud off your soles" movement on the upstroke. However, as I got older and the padding on the bottom of my feet got thinner, my soles began to feel like they were on fire and I could barely walk after getting off my bike. Today, I found MY perfect soluction which is the flat platform pedal like the one above made by MKS (I got mine from Rivendell many years ago) with the addition of Powergrip Straps (see link below). I can wear my thick soled leather sneakers and pedal all day in comfort. The Powergrip Straps are as tight or loose as I want simply by moving the angle of my foot. Or I can just turn the pedal upside down and not use them at all. Please note there are two sizes of metal attachment which comes with the PowerGrip Strap. I have to use the longer one to accomodate my wide foot. $URL$ 

That's probably going to be an issue. Sheldon Brown has this page about BB standards: $URL$ From that I'm guessing yours is probably 71mm x 1 3/8" X 26 tpi which is not going to be compatible with much of anything. I don't know if someone like Phil Wood makes cups to fit that size. 

I would go as wide as your frame and fork will allow. The increased volume will support the weight better than a skinnier tire at higher pressure. 

$URL$ I think it may be this one (Wheels Manufacturing #16). Is there a broken bolt in the hole just above the rear axle? You will need to find a way to get that out to be able to mount the hanger properly. For a derailleur, it would be nice to match it with the front, so look for a 9-speed Shimano XT. Try to avoid low-normal (Shimano calls it rapid-rise) derailleurs. Any Shimano 9-speed mountain bike derailleur will work (Deore, LX, XT, XTR). I wouldn't go below the Deore level to keep similar quality level for all components. 

Park HCW-11 wrench to remove/adjust the BB cups: $URL$ RT-1 to remove the headset cups: $URL$ or just a long flat head screwdriver and hammer to gently tap them out. 

I think it might be Hanger #31 from Wheels Manufacturing: $URL$ It's a little tough to see in your photo, but that's the closest I could find. 

If you use a 10-speed cassette, you'll need to use a 10-speed shifter as the spacing between cogs needs to match the amount of cable pulled by the shifter. If you want to use a 9-speed shifter, then use a 9-speed cassette and take out one cog. Also, You probably don't want to take off the smallest cog since it's the one designed to mesh up with the lockring. Any other cog (including the largest) should be fine. 

Yes, they will work with most STI levers. Cantilevers and road calipers use the same cable pull. If you were ever to convert from cantilever to linear pull (v-brakes) then you would have to be more careful in matching them up. 

According to Shimano, the RD-6800 GS is designed for 28-32T largest cog, where the SS is designed for 23-28. $URL$ $URL$ They may have actually done something different to the body of the derailleur instead of just putting a longer cage on it. I don't know that for sure though. Of course, that doesn't mean the GS can't work with 25. Your chain length shouldn't affect the B position at all. It will only affect the rotation of the cage around the upper pulley. 

it's worth noting that although the first bottom bracket came with the bike, i did replace the crankset a few hundred miles before before it started to show play so feasibly i could have done something wrong then; i could have possibly overtightened the plastic pre-load screw on the crank. the second BB didn't have an ideal installation as i did it at the side of the road on tour and there was a tiny tiny amount of drizzle, but i don't think i overtightened the pre load and if any water got into the shell it was only a minute amount. as it's a touring bike it has also had a fair amount of use in the rain and with heavy rear panniers and the occasional rough road. 

i have a wheel, and i want a spare spoke to take touring. (it's a front wheel with a disc rotor, i have one for the rotor side but have lost the one i had for the non rotor side) is it possible accurately measure the spoke when it's in the wheel? i've attempted to use some strings but i'm not clear on where you'd measure to. i understand that you start at the centre of the j bend, but presumably some of the nipple/spoke is inside the rim. perhaps i should remove the tyre and rim tape, and measure the amount of spoke protruding l. is there a reliable technique i can use for this? edit: i'd like to avoid removing a spoke out if at all possible. the rim was built by a professional wheel builder, it's running true and i have only minimal wheel trying skills 

I have purchased a handbuilt rear wheel that will be used with a disc brake and never with a rim brake (it has a 6 bolt hub). The rim is a mavic a719. The rim is anodized black but the machined part (rim brake surfact) is silver. Ideally I'd like it to be black for aesthetic purposes and was thinking about giving it a light coat of spray paint. Is there any reason that this is a bad idea? Is there any other way of easily making it black? NB: I'm aware that there are non machined rims available. I'm aware that some my see it as ugly or poor etiquette to run a disc hub and machined rim. After a lot of research, I concluded that this was the rim I wanted.
