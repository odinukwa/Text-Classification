Because, like the library, the parasites are sentient. One does not commit genocide on sentient beings that one has caused to be brought into being through one's actions, unless one wishes to fill one's library with evil magic residue. And if one happens to be an evil mage, who WANTs evil magic residue, then doing so regularly would make more evil residue, so killing all of them off would be counterproductive. Also, being sentient, they are also vindictive. Most of the old tales say not to mess in the affairs of the elves, or spriggans, sprites, or other fae. That's basically what these things are. Sentient, spiteful and capricious. Leave milk out for them each night, and a little bread, and you'll be fine. 

Consider the humble butterfly. It has but one genome, which it shares with the even humbler caterpillar. The butterfly has six skinny legs, wings, a loooong rolled proboscis, a diet of nectar... the caterpillar has sixteen stumpy legs (six of them "real", ten "prolegs"), web spinerettes, hairs, mandibles, and a diet of leaves... completely different creature. From the same genes. The two forms are switched between by activating one part of the genome and deactivating another. Thus, genes to create and operate two essentially completely different creatures can work from a single genome. 

This isn't fantasy, except for the fact that there's a single party. This is a fairly well-known system called managed democracy. As you've established, the single-party plan is not really the safest approach, since it means that if you become unpopular, there's only one other game in town, so their votes simply become a measure of your own unpopularity, no matter how bad they are. So the reply to the question is that the only way to maintain power in a 2-party system is to always seem the lesser of two evils, to the majority of voters: better the devil you know, many will say. It may also help to foster a fear that votes are being monitored and those who vote for the rainbow party will be blacklisted, especially if you can keep the majority of your citizenry at just the level of poverty where they are more concerned about their wellbeing and not losing their jobs, than they are about taking a stand: not so harsh as to incite rebellion, nor so soft as to allow the leisure to protest. As a fantasy, such a 2-party system might make sense to a US reader, who will be accustomed to a two-party system, and may feel it to be the natural state of things, and it's also a little simpler to write about, since there are only two parties. But it's just not a secure option to someone wanting to retain power. Vladislav Surkov is one of the masterminds who until recently maintained Russia's managed democracy, calling it "sovereign democracy": having multiple, small and manageable opposition parties in his pocket, to prevent the development of serious contenders. $URL$ - a famous photo-essay of his office, containing multiple telephones, each labelled with the name of an "opposition party" that he managed. Further research around him, and Russia's managed/sovereign democracy in general, might give some good tidbits to help flesh out the verisimilitude of worldbuilding a managed democracy. 

Cooperative games are the ideal, I suppose. There are plenty of examples in the gaming world already. Consider puzzle games like Portal 2. Difficulty can ramp by adding timers. Consider a game such as "scatter N pieces randomly on a grid. Each players turn, they may move M pieces from any square to any other, then one step of Conway's game of life is performed on the board. The goal is for the players to cooperatively clear the board in the minimal number of steps". Difficulty can ramp by increasing M, reducing N, changing board shape or size, and changing the rules about where you can move pieces (must have clear line of sight to destination; must end adjacent to another piece; etc). Cooperative non-combat RPGs would be fun. One possibility that might fit well with the theme would be a cooperative version of a Cross-and-circle game (eg pachisi, ludo) in which the goal is for each piece to not come into conflict with any others. Conflict/collision will remove both pieces from the game, but self-sacrifice will remove only one: given the goal is to retain as many pieces at the end of the game as possible, self-sacrifice is the best move if the game looks like it might put two pieces in conflict on your next dice-roll. The point of all co-op games is that you succeed or fail as a group. Each person's contribution is important. 

While the answer "the nearest edge of the Habitable/Goldilocks zone" is a good one, Youstay Igo's advice about worldbuilding is perhaps the best part of an excellent answer. A planet can be outside the habitable zone for millions of years before its atmosphere freezes or blows away. Tidally locked planets can have a mini-goldilocks zone of liquid water between the frozen and the gaseous, for some time. Cave-dwellers can hold onto atmosphere even after it's left the surface. And so on. Sticking to the boring limits of generic science will give you a generic planet, rather than an interesting "on the edge" planet which would be fertile ground for the best stories. 

One of the technologies being mooted at the moment for the ISS is a great big laser to blast orbital debris sufficiently to deflect it. So a smaller cross-sectional area in the direction you are traveling is an advantage for deflection. For rotational artificial gravity, rotational symmetry matters, at least in terms of mass, as does having bulkheads that are parallel to the rotation so they work as floors. So in a rotationally-symmetric ship, at any point there'll be a circular cross-section, or similar. (You could instead have a large mass on one side, counterbalancing a large arm further out but with higher velocity, orbiting around the center of mass. The center of mass would remain stationary on ship, which is important when you want the thrust to go through that center of mass.) For any kind of static anti-radiation shielding around the ship, smooth lines with no spikey bits make the field easier to calculate and keep constant. 

But this is Worldbuilding.se. So we have Worldbuilding concerns. So this IS a Worldbuilding question. So perhaps instead the question can become: "are there things that would decide one way or the other between those two options? That could either permit or forbid LEDs (diodes are semiconductors), LCDs, and plasma screens?" That depends on the terms of the law, and that falls very firmly into the realm of Worldbuilding. Say the law came about because an Artificial General Intelligence nearly wiped out humanity, causing everyone to have to flee to Mars. So, obviously, the police and public will understand the law as "no computers", since that's the easiest way to explain it to laymen, but what actually is forbidden is some blahblah legalese fine print that prevents AGI from being redeveloped. In that case, the law may be written to prevent use of semiconductors, which would prevent any realistic kind of AGI-capable computer. This would also prevent LEDs and OLEDs, but permit plasma and LCD. Or it could be written about the processes used to create them: no photolithography, perhaps. This would make any of these technologies difficult or just completely impossible, other than the CRT. Or it could be written to prevent digital electronics - again, this would limit things pretty much to the CRT. In these latter two cases, you'd be stuck with CRTs and valves as the standard technology, which means that you get to use nixie tubes, which means that you've won the internet even in a universe with no internet. You win yourself a lovely retrofuturistic technopunk world. People might wear disabled ICs as jewelry in the same way that steampunks wear cogs. 

Statistically speaking, it seems improbable that we are not. Consider that at some point there will be one reality; and N simulations, where N is likely to be large. Consider that in each simulated reality, if reality is correctly simulated, there will be people who want to create simulations. So there will be, in a perfect simulation, N^2 simulations. And each of those will contain simulations, all the way down to the limit of the outermost resolution. So N^M where M is the limit of the number of levels before the resolution is too low for sum-simulations to be viable. So our odds of being in the original simulation are 1 to N^M. Logic suggests that N^M will be really, really big, so our chances of being in the original are approximately zero. Question is: what difference should this make to how you live your life? I can see no apparent reason for it to make any difference whatever, though it does suggest that there may be bugs that could be internally exploited. Biggest argument against all this is the absence of apparent bugs: a system so complex should have a LOT more bugs. Possibly they are shown by some stuff in $URL$ and arguably everything we dismiss as superstitious nonsense, any of which could be true in a simulation. 

It really depends what range you want it invisible from. "From the outside" is quite a large range of values. I'm assuming "orbit around the star" (quite hard) rather than "orbit around a nearby star" (much easier) or "orbit around the planet itself (impossible)". If you want a natural effect, probably the best you can do is to hide it the same way that islands were hidden in tales of yore - in a cloud. A planet is defined as an object which has cleared its orbit, so technically, just by cluttering the orbit, you make the planet literally disappear - there is no longer a planet in that orbit, by definition. But there's still one hell of a big rock. From a large enough distance, it'd be enough to fill the planet's orbit with enough high-albedo "chaff" that the planet would not be comparatively noticeable to instruments either when crossing the sun ("eclipse"), or when reflecting it ("full moon"). The closer you need the non-detection, the more dust you need. A light mist will conceal an island from ten miles out, but you need a pea-souper to conceal it from ten yards! Now, downside is, the dust will make the star look really weird. "A star that age, with so much dust, such thickly-populated rings? How strange." The dust will also affect the planet, reducing incoming sunlight, and falling constantly into the atmosphere in some brilliant and beautiful eternal aurorae, perhaps laced with shooting stars of the larger particles. The planet would be better protected against radiation, and could possibly be heated by the aurorae at least to some extent, but I'm not sure how effective that would be. There'd also need to be something to produce the dust, which might in turn be detectable. [Edit: If you only need to protect from viewing directly in line with the planet's orbital plane, then you don't need dust in the planet's path - you can have a larger ring outside the planet, like our asteroid belt but much thicker, which would obscure it sufficiently, from that one angle.] [Edit2: Note that ring thickness is unstable, but rings can be cabled, and if we're assuming that the rings can be produced, they can be renewed anyway. A solid ring (Dyson ring) resolves the stability problem but becomes a world more complex to create, and creates its own stability issues. And all this is moot in the longer term anyway, since as @2012rcampion commented on another answer, with sufficiently sensitive instrumentation, and long enough study (at least one year, poss many more), merely observing the motion of any visible planets and the sun should be enough to find a planet in the mist even from another star.] 

I disagree that the government would be a significant issue in a world where lobbyists are a thing. Buying the necessary parts of the government becomes trivial: your lobbyists give them free immortality in return for passing whatever laws you want. No other lobbyists can ever outbid you. See: Disney and copyright. "What would stop such company from just making new currency of "hours", "days", "months", "years", "decades" and so on, and making everyone want to work for them?" Well, I'd argue that at least amongst the people I know, close to everyone wants to work for a computer games company. The problem is manifold, but includes: 1) There just aren't that many jobs available for your desired company, whatever that company is. 2) If everyone did work for that company... what would be the point, in anything? You'd have, effectively, a combination of a socialist society and a meritocracy. Everyone works for the Big Company, and gets paid according to their worth to the company. That payment is then exchanged at company stores, for other company products. Suddenly, as well as life extension, the company is having to manufacture and provide hair extensions, hamburgers, USB chargers... and if there are no other companies, then they can't outsource it to anyone. Who wants to rule the world, if you have to then run every childcare, every hair salon, every sewerage plant... So, even the world's most wealthy company, even if it diversified and bought out most other companies, is very unlikely to make everyone work for it, or even to want to. Typically, a company wants fewer employees in order to reduce overheads. "Total costs of a year of youth is significantly less than one man-year. For example, total of ten man hours to produce equipment, maintenance, energy and all for a year of lifespan granted." This paragraph is confusing: I suspect you mean "significantly more" - that is, as you describe, the cost to buy an extra year, is ten years' work for the average man-in-the-street, rather than the other way around. But let's investigate both. 10x more than average US wage. You've then put a price on an extra year of life at about $450k in today's money. Meaning, the average man can't typically get much of an extension and is better off just living well; but anyone rich enough to afford to hire ten flunkies to sit around and do nothing, can also afford immortality. So, the elite become immortal, but this affects everyday life of normal people only through the laws that the company gets pushed through to protect its intellectual property, and through the job opportunities offered for rejuvenating the rich. For each person rejuvenated for a year, ten people get paying jobs. Yay for the economy! 1/10 average US wage. You've then put a price on an extra year of life at about $4.5k in today's money. This is where it gets interesting, because youth drops within the reach of common men. The average man can remain alive indefinitely for what is essentially a 10% tax. The poor are shortlived and a vast class divide opens up between the middle-class and lower-class. For the have-nots, crime can actually pay: even if you get caught, you just need to earn enough to cover your time in jail, plus 10%. Jails become even more crowded. Punishment: there'd be the new punishment of getting banned from the rejuvenation system, or having limits imposed (you can only rejuvenate between this range of physical ages, etc), and the crimes for which you can be punished in this way are whatever the Company decides. Don't make your debt repayment to them? Publish a blog post defaming them? sky's the limit, there's no law saying they have to serve you. Perversion: The pedo contingent moves from online chatrooms into reality, of course, along with the ABDLers and neotenists and others, as cliques of eternal children, and those who prey on them, protect them, and service their needs. Age-discrimination laws might change - would someone ten years old physically be subject to the same laws as someone mentally ten years old? And yet, this stops being a big deal - with so many youthful-seeming people with power, instead, the big deal becomes those who fetishize and prey upon the vulnerable aged, with their lowered faculties, technological inexperience, and so forth. Population: The population... does it explode? Probably not. Nobody actually dies of "old age", even now, so by reversing aging, you have just removed the damage that time has done to their person. Perhaps this treatment also reverses the course of those many common age-related chronic ailments, like cancer, diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, liver disease, Alzheimers, etc that 50% of people over 65 currently have at least two of? This might affect death rates, then. But I doubt population would explode too violently. People would still die, of the same causes, disease, accident, war, murder, suicide and more. Illness: And, knowing that the Treatment would reverse the ailments, people would take greater risks. The Treatment fixes up livers and lungs? Well, let's smoke and drink! It fixes AIDS? Well, then sex is safe again, and we can carry once more down the path of libertinage that the 60s and 70s went down before AIDS reared its ugly head! Children: People might not live forever, but they live a lot longer... but they don't have such a rush to have kids. Maybe they'll wait until after their first rejuve. Or the tenth. When the time is right. When they've got a bit more money, and can afford to get a house for the kids as well as an education. Because, inheritance largely dies out. Each new generation needs to buy its own home, and so forth. Retirement funds and pensions would be a thing of the past, eaten up by the rejuvenation process. Immigration: In the shrinking-population US, immigration is OK, but in the rising-population post-rejuve society, immigration becomes a danger to you and your children. House prices, education, and so much more will become more expensive. So immigration will be discouraged... UNLESS there are laws allowing immigration of the can't-rejuves, to do the "poor people" jobs, and by providing the "poor part" of the population, hence ensure that it is much harder for full citizens to fall down to the can't-rejuve level. Social upward mobility from the can't-rejuves into the rejuvables would be strongly discouraged by the wealthy, though there'll always be rights activists who fight for equality. Debt: Death is no longer the solution to all life's ills: you can't run up all your cards and shrug, saying "well, I'll be dead soon anyway". But just as today's healthcare debt burden is bad, so the rejuvenation debt burden will be crippling for many. Eventually, they will be unable to afford another rejuve, and as their bodies fail, they'll be less and less able to earn, so less and less able to rejuve. There'd be charities for such hopeless cases, and rejuve lotteries, but the vast majority will age and die. ID Cards: Identity will be harder to prove, and so biometrics will matter more: a DNA pinprick to prove that you really are yourself, and not your granddaughter. SOME of these effects would still happen with crazily expensive rejuvenation... but not nearly as much social upheaval as if the common man could attain immortality.
