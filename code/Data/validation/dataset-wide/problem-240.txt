What it requires is starting with some pretty extreme technology--the fabricator of Star Trek or the like. It's impossible for a group that small to have all the required skills, let alone the time to do all the various tasks. 

I think it could exist without too much of a handwave: You need some really major mountains, stuff that towers way above Everest. (Which is either a low-g world or a handwave.) The air pressure above them is so low that it seriously limits winds going over them, the winds are channeled by them instead. You have multiple chains of mountains, they run east-west. (Cause: A major subduction event from plates meeting in a north-south direction.) The layout of the mountains directs warm wind towards the poles, other mountains direct cold winds away from the poles. Your ice/sand desert exists where these two winds are once again moving east/west and parallel to each other. Eventually the temperatures equalize but you'll have a zone where you have substantially different temperatures right next to each other. While you will find no place on Earth where air behaves like this you can find examples of it in water--places where water from a hot spring join an ordinary stream. Earlier this year I even saw a spot where water of two different colors was flowing down the same streambed. (Go farther downstream and it's all mixed.) 

High performance flight is unpleasant in some fashion. Perhaps the acceleration involved, perhaps something related to the FTL drive. You go fast if you need to but it's more comfortable to go slower. 

Expanding upon Tektotherriggen's answer: 1) You don't want just one tree slice. Make many. Bring as many as you can with you, hide the others. Bring one/hide one/bring one etc. While you could have grown a tree in an isotopically filtered environment, how did you make the different slices (that will match up when placed together) have different ages? 2) A good hiding place would be Antarctica, somewhere not too far from the south pole. Unless the whole place has melted by then they'll be buried in the ice--and you can date ice layers like you can date tree rings. Mark all hidden packages "Property of name, traveling through time from 2018 to 21118. Please leave in situ or store until then." Even if a package is found that might get it into a museum somewhere. And a separate idea: 3) Publish an interesting story. Part of the story deals with an encrypted message--and the message is in the book. The characters never manage to actually decrypt it. You have the decryption key, the message says who you are. Put your book out there on the pirate sites, also, so it ends up in the libraries of those who collect lots of books--hopefully it will persist in such collections over the ages. 

As has been said, the Coriolis effect makes this world uninhabitable but lets look further: We have a world where the the equator is moving at it's orbital velocity. What happens? First, you can't walk around on the equator any more than you can walk around inside the ISS. You're in orbit, there's nothing to stick your feet to the ground. Second, look at the atmosphere. We survive because there are about 10,000kg/m^2 of air above us, accelerated downward at 9.8m/s. We are at the equator, though, where the net downward force is 0.0m/s. that 10,000kg becomes irrelevant, you're in vacuum. Oops, you need 16,000 Pascals of oxygen to survive. You're dead. Third, look at the atmosphere. We have 10,000kg/m^2 of air at zero pressure--it's going to go flying outward, the same as if you broke open a cylinder of air in space. You have other air on the planet, it will equalize pressure--and promptly get flung off into space. All your atmosphere very quickly goes into orbit. Fourth, look at the ground. It's in free fall--nothing holds it down. The winds are going to toss about anything short of bedrock. (That is, until the atmosphere is gone, then you'll just get a surface made of a mass of disconnected bits.) Finally, lets look at the planet as a whole. Remember, one of the required characteristics of a planet is that it have gravity strong enough to have pulled it into an oblate sphere--the surface of a planet is at basically equal net potential. (Yes, the Earth is bigger at the equator than around the poles. Stop the Earth's rotation and you'll leave the equator dry and the poles under a very deep ocean.) However, we have already defined the potential at the equator to be zero. Oops--the planet can't have any gravity anywhere. You have a spinning disk of zero thickness that can't be reasonably called a planet at all. 

A possible answer: You have a very thick atmosphere. Missile weapons quickly bleed off their velocity and thus are only useful at short ranges. 

You say the fae are no match for the humans in a fight but that's only an up-and-up fight. The weapon of choice is a fae-sized lance. Two fae pick up lances, turn invisible and charge (flying.) Their objective is the eyes. Against a target that's not constantly moving around this should be very effective. Blind the guards. Blind anyone else in the vicinity. Eventually they will be able to cut the cage bars (any hard grit attached to a string--two groups of fae pulling it back and forth) free of interference by the humans. The only defense the humans have is a face covering that they can see through but the fae can't attack through--a knight's helmet. How likely is it that there will be a knight about?? 

One method that has been considered for disposal of nuclear waste is to put it in containers and drop it into deep ocean mud. The objective is to get the container to sink into the mud, once it's buried it doesn't matter if the container fails. The impact is basically zero. Even if you don't bury the containers the effect is minimal. It's hundreds of years before the water comes up to the surface, during that time most of the radioactivity will have decayed (especially if you remove the useful stuff first.) 

While the it's-not-possible answers are correct for the question you intended to ask lets try another approach: For colder climates it's technically possible (but economic insanity) to build a refrigerator that contains no cooling element at all. Lets make the Green Fridge (tm): No ozone-destroying Freon! No toxic ammonia! No risk of incomplete combustion of the propane causing CO poisoning! Uses far less electricity than a normal refrigerator! You'll be safe against anything less than a direct hit by a nuke! Dig a big, deep hole. In the hole we put a large, very well insulated, very strong walk-in cooled space. Note that this will be at at least the sub-basement level, ideally it would be accessed by stairs or a ramp going down so as to minimize the air spill when the door is opened. There are two holes in the ceiling of the cooled space. Above the cooled space, separated by the insulation layer is a large concrete box. One of the holes from the ceiling connects to a U-shaped pipe (so the opening points down) in one corner of the box, the other to a pipe in the opposite corner that connects to the top, again with a U on the end. There is a large bimetallic thermometer on the first pipe that opens or closes a baffle in the pipe. There also must be a drain for the box. A pipe heading up goes into the third corner of the box, the box is filled with large gravel, a pipe is added in the last corner and it's roofed over and likewise very well insulated. Pipe #3 is insulated and extended to a surface air intake. There is a fan in this pipe (the only powered component in the whole thing!) that turns on when the outside air is colder than the air in the box. The final pipe vents back to the surface, ideally after running a bit through the ground first to dump its cold into the soil. Now the whole thing is covered over except for the vent pipes and however you plan to get to your storage space. You want some feet of dirt and then a moisture barrier layer and more dirt. Assuming you sized it big enough and the winters are cold enough this will work--you get a cold space for no more operating costs than running a fan in the winter. Note that so long as you are dealing with an airburst this should survive anything, although escape might be problematic. You have basically perfect radiation shielding, the only modification you'll need to make to ride out the nuke attack is to add a supply of compressed air to use while the firestorm burns overhead. (Note: In practice you would put the cold space on the bottom and use a fan to bring up the air, I was going for ultimate green. Also, the thermal mass needed is simply too great to be worth it. However, a related idea is in actual use by some people: Bury your house as indicated, run the air feeds through enough ground and you can climate-control your house with nothing but a fan. While the total heating/cooling needed is a lot greater the outside air will be in the right direction far more often and the natural ground temperature isn't too far below what you want for your house anyway.) 

Travel is cheap because you are moving around mostly by means of skyhooks and catapaults (on airless bodies)--mass ratios are low so you don't have to throw away your rocket every trip. Since the boost period is very short you are seriously limited in maximum velocity because of the lack of human tolerance of acceleration. You also have to wait for launch windows and most flights are to the next planetary (or asteroid) orbit even if your final destination is farther away. You can also get situations where the trip is very asymmetric--one end of the trip has a big catapault (wrap a linear motor clear around the moon and you can boost to anything from sun-grazer to an escape orbit) but at the destination you shed your speed in an aerobrake and have no monster catapault for the return voyage. 

Bring down a sufficiently big asteroid. It would be a very slow process but within today's technology--you just need to take along enough bombs (I'm figuring an Orion drive.) Much lower energy requirements but much slower would be to bring down a sufficiently large comet. You would have to find a suitable candidate in the outer solar system. Things move so slowly out there that it doesn't take much of a nudge but you had better have a very good guidance system as it's going to come in on automatic--you won't live long enough to complete the mission. 

Water levels, but a very different answer than above: The area is ringed with mountains sufficient to block normal travel. The only reason there is anyone living there is that there is a river that flows through the area, on both ends it flows through caves. In periods of high flow you run out of ceiling. In periods of low flow your raft runs aground. Note that the safe flow rate for the two caves is different, this gives one window in which you can enter and one in which you can leave and they do not overlap. Note that properly packaged cargo can be shipped during periods of high flow--pack it to take a beating and drop your container in the river, it's fished out by nets on the other side. The water flow over the ages has worn away any spots that would cause them to hang up. 

Since you are prepared for this task it's going to be simple enough: You need a small computer and a decent camera. Point the camera at the night sky (day does not work--while the stars are out they're swamped by the reflected light in the sky) and let the computer find planets. It can easily have been programmed to do this, find what piece of sky the view corresponds to, subtract the known stars and what's left are planets. If the trip is long enough, look for the displacement of the stars instead. 

Realistically you can't have a really large rotating cylinder of air. The problem is not the Coriolis force but the air speed difference between the surface (considerable) and the center (zero.) That is going to cause an awful lot of turbulence. If your habitat is big enough you're going to have to do something to prevent that--say, barriers at various altitudes. They wouldn't need to be anything major. 

HDE gave a very good answer but I'll take up one point he missed: Permanence. The lack of total permanence of structures isn't a reason you couldn't colonize. 1) Ever hear of repairs? 2) Even if you can't repair the domes for some reason that doesn't mean you can't build new ones as the old ones wear out. 

I could imagine it happening. Suppose we have a mutation: It improves the ability to function with low levels of oxygen but the flip side of this is that the system becomes very vulnerable to too much oxygen--for much lower levels of "too much". When you get one copy of the gene you don't function quite as well at any altitude but you can function at a higher altitude than those who don't have it at all. If you get two copies you can function at even higher altitudes but the lowlands become lethal with prolonged exposure. (Think of humans--we can function between about 2 and 10 psi of oxygen, with prolonged exposure to pressure outside this range causing serious problems or death.) Those who get two copies have a niche they can live in that starts out without competition and since everyone up there has two copies it now breeds true. You have your separated population and thus they will in time diverge. 

Do they need to be humans? Lets take a very different approach: The "humans" inhabiting Mars are a group that wanted to cut themselves off from the rest of humanity. To this end they did some genetic modification to tolerate life in a far higher pressure than a mod 0 human can tolerate. The Martian terraforming consisted of building up the Martian atmosphere to a tremendous density. This provides far better impact protection than Martian colonists would currently experience and makes flight impractical (planes work, they just have to go very slowly--high speed transit will be by hyperloops) and rockets impossible (they work, the drag is so bad they can't reach orbit) and thus any trip to the Martian surface is a one way voyage.
