Why don't match up? That's because I did not load the for every . Let me load the relationships and try your second query again. 

Just supply the name of the database in the along with the tables whose rows are to be one by one in the variable. Please note how the dumpfile name has a datetime appended to the table name so you can do some versioning based on the datetime. You can change that to be versioned any way you wish. You did ask that each row be in its own file. I will leave that up to you to script. 

Upon installation of mysql, you will see two rows that give full access to any database named 'test' or whose first 5 characters are 'test_'. Why is this a problem ??? Try running this command: 

ALTERNATE SUGGESTION This may seem unorthodox and probably smells like SQL Anitpattern, but here it goes... 

Your bulk insert buffer is 4G. That's great ... FOR MyISAM !!! InnoDB does not use the bulk insert buffer. You may need to have sqlalchemy throttle the calls into multiple transactions. You may also want to disable innodb_change_buffering, setting it to . Unfortunately, you cannot do . If you dom you may need to set it in my.cnf and restart mysql. UPDATE 2012-07-13 16:53 EDT I just noticed that you have two values in the my.cnf for . First one is 2385M, and the last one is 14G. If MySQL for Windows accepted 14G and you only have 12G of RAM, your server must be having a good old time swapping. You can verify what the buffer pool size is with 

These are the four files read (if they exist). The above displays come from a Linux Box. So, please run 

RECOMMENDATIONS Disable your query cache by setting query_cache_size and query_cache_type to 0. If things improve, all, well and good. If it does not improve, you must do three(3) things 

Nothing in the Documentation states a way to set a size or know its limitations. It only recommends placing the doublewrite file on a fast HDD. CONJECTURE (OK I am guessing at this point) If there is no limit on the doublewrite buffer size, then the number of blocks that make up all the data and index pages would be the maximum size. You would run this query: 

If you want the number of Saturdays and Sundays in a given month, you can do this First, generate a calender using a given date 

How ? The server option local_infile must be disabled. Check your my.cnf for load_infile. If you are using a web hosting service, they may or may not allow it. For example, you cannot do that with Amazon RDS for MySQL. You might be able to get away with using MySQL in Amazon EC2. Check with your administrators in that respect. 

If you close your session, the next session you open will have autocommit back at 1. That means you will have to disable autocommit and set each time. Perhaps would be better 

If you see DB Connections coming in from the Apache Servers, CONGRATULATIONS you have manually performed a failover. UPDATE 2012-09-19 14:28 EDT If you cannot use a DBVIP, you must do more work instead STEP 01) Activate Binary Logging on the Slave Add this to /etc/my.cnf on the Slave 

OVERHEAD What needs to be understood is a partitioned table's physical implementation. For example, in my old post ( : How does subpartitioning actually work and what physical files are created?), I displayed what a partitioned table looks like: 

Many have always wanted mysqldump to ignore databases. Would you believe that option exists now ??? No, not in mysqldump. Oracle (Yuck, toowee, still doesn't roll off the tongue) has DataPump (expdb impdp) to dump Oracle databases. Since MySQL 5.7 in the Oracle family (still hurting), the new backup utility program is called mysqlpump, which comes with --exclude-databases and other neat options. Like its older stepbrother datapump, mysqlpump also features parallelism to help speed up dumps and divide work. At this time, I have not incorporated into at the job, but it looks very promising. When I deep dive into mysqlpump I might find that it brings the same look and feel as Oracle's datapump. If there is anyone in the MySQL Parallel Universe with stories about it, please post it here. 

It would include mysqldump for one simple reason: It uses a DB Connection. That DB Connection, when you do , has a running on a table at any given moment during the mysqldump. 

There is no natural way to do this except to use information_schema.tables to record all columns with auto_increment option. You could collect those columns as follows: 

There are several things you can do THING #1 Expand all to in all Stored Procedures. This will accommodate longer Family Tree Listings. This is vital because can grow longer and longer if you have a lopsided tree structure. It also possible that when queue_children was 1024 in length and did not delimit properly, it probably went into some infinite loop trying to terminate properly and never reached the condition when the would be 0. THING #2 GROUP_CONCAT()'s maximum length is limited by group_concat_max_len (default is 1024). Try expanding group_concat_max_len to something ridiculously large (5000000000). THING #3 Increase your thread_stack, perhaps 512K or 1M. This is needed for Stored Procedures with either recursive operations or, in this case, longer local variables to make room for. 

You may find this surprising, but mysqld actually determines the correct value for you upon startup. The MySQL Documentation says the default value for is 0. Yet, when you run the command , it does not come back with 0. It returns what mysqld would comfortably run with. The MySQL Documentation says the maximum value for is 65535. I have seen some systems with the setting above 100000 upon startup (132332 to be exact). That being the case, there are some instances where you cannot set any higher. Just run the command I mentioned 

Since dividing row operations by the rates do not yield the same time elapsed for InnoDB's lifetime (or possibly just the real-time seconds elapsed per operation), you have to suspect a floating sign issue. What would be a possible culprit in this instance? 

This will rename the table, perform the defragmentation, and rename it back. You could do it in one line as well 

Look in the upper left hand corner where you see the buffer pool. There is a section of it called the "Insert Buffer Part". The purpose of the Insert Buffer is to populate changes to non-unique indexes into the Insert Buffer inside the system tablespace file (a.k.a. ibdata1). From the diagram, up to 50% of the Buffer Pool can be used to manage the Insert Buffer. That being the case, it would be in your best interests to assign a lot more memory to the Buffer Pool. With a data set of 60M, 256M would be a great place to start, 

PHP must be expecting to use the old MySQL authentication plugin algorithms. You do not have to restart mysql. Since old_passwords is a globally dynamic option, all you have to do is run the following: 

When you shifted the IP within your application, any DB Connections that were open at the moment were totally unaware of the move. A quick would reveal that on Master1. You would be better off doing the cutover of the IP as follows: 

to partition the table is out of the question here. What you really need is a set of stored procedures that will migrate the data in a new table with minimal downtime (less than 10 seconds). CREATE NEW PARTITION TABLE 

It is no longer a case of EXPLAIN a query. If you can EXPLAIN the procedure, you can code. Obviously, if you can EXPLAIN a procedure faster, you can produce faster code. 

STEP 01) Setup DRBD on Separate ServerDB2 As I mentioned earlier, you can house mysql on a DRBD mount. STEP 02) Setup MySQL Replication Huh ??? How did MySQL Replication enter the picture 

I think your problem may stem from where you wrote the directive Make sure you place the option under the header in /etc/my.cnf 

This display reveals that John gave two different answers to question 2 and Sally gave two different answers to question 1. To catch which questions were answered differently by all users, just place the above query in a subquery and check for a comma in the list of given answers to get the count of distinct answers as follows: 

You have two caches, one for each Storage Engine. MyISAM Only caches index pages in the key buffer (sized of key_buffer_size). All data pages are read from the of the MyISAM table. InnoDB Three Components 

Create a perl script the opens a DB Connection on the master, and then in an infinite loop performs this on the master: 

Give the presence of that is growing, it must be a temp table used to determine how row data is compressed and then cached to disk. (ARCHIVE does not cache data in memory). At this point, your problem is at the compression layer of the storage engine. WHAT TO DO NEXT Run and copy the , , and to another server that has the same OS server. Do not copy from Linux to Windows. Try running there. If you still cannot read the data, you may have to do some deeper diving. You could try downloading archive_reader.c (from Twitter), compile it and try to read your data. Godspeed, Spiderman !!! (My Disclaimer). ONCE YOU HAVE RECOVERED YOUR DATA SUGGESTION #1 Do not use the REPLACE command against an ARCHIVE table. Why ??? 

In a Galera cluster, any node can play the part of a Master node. Such a node can execute DML (INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs). If DML statements are spread across multiple Master nodes and are targeting the same tables, you must expect log conflicts. Why ? Galera wsrep libraries were designed to commit DML changes if all nodes in a cluster are ready to do so. If one node cannot do so, all nodes must abandon a commit. It's basically all-or-nothing commits. If you look at the bottom of the document you referenced, there are suggestions to minimize log conflicts under the heading :
