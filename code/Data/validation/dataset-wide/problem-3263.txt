A quick google search suggests that the answer might be 1930. I suspect that if you consult google for similar documents you may be able to refine the answer or increase the confidence in the 1930 guess. 

Although you connect them together in a thesis (Is #2 evidence of #1), they are not quite that closely related. For #1 - the US was very explicitly not to be a confederation. The Articles of Confederation had failed, and the failure was accelerating. The new nation was to be "of the people" - there was a direct relationship between the people and the new government. In the Articles, the members of the government were the states in confederation; in the Constitution the members of the government were the people. This is why the Constitution was submitted to ratifying conventions in every state - the states were not given the chance to vote on the new government, and when the notion was suggested, it was rejected. So the new government was of the people, not of the states. Klarman mentions that at one point they realized that if the government were of the states and if one of the states were to ignore an obligation, the only recourse would have been war; if the government were of the people, and one of the people were to ignore an obligation, there were better options. With respect to #2 - one of the signs that the Articles had failed was an increase in populism. Shay's rebellion was the worst, but in pretty much every colony there were movements led by common, ordinary people to obtain relief from inconvenient laws (particularly debts). They wanted paper money and high inflation. (inflation is generally good for the debtor). The political classes were perplexed, and perhaps horrified by the notion of shopkeepers and apprentices using political activity to obtain short term advantage without any consideration of the long term consequences. Therefore the new government was constructed to control and limit the power of populism. Indirect elections were used to remove the prizes of government from strictly popular control. (Klarman is probably a better read on this topic). In both cases, I'm simplifying complex topics. 

I think that it will be impossible to provide the kind of data you want, but we can approximate an answer. A google search on "Decline of Christianity in Britain" will reveal multiple articles by eminent Britons that agree that Christianity is declining. Lord Carey thinks soAmericans think so. The Telegraph thinks so. The same search repeated for the USA indicates that the church may not be declining (*Update: I don't intend this single citation to prove the point. I didn't want to base my answer on the simple assertion of OP. While I think OP's assertion is probably correct, I don't have the data and I don't want to gather the data. I started the answer by comparing two google searches - the google search on Britain suggests that there is consensus that the church is declining, while the google search on the USA suggests that the conclusion is still in doubt. I admit that is a very weak methodology, but I think I've made it clear this is an approximate answer.) How can we explain this? I'm afraid that I cannot list a single, succinct resource, but I think the discussion below relies on Gordon Wood's American Revolution - I have similar information from a bunch of diffuse sources. 

Communism advocated worldwide revolution, and the abolishment of private property. That seems to be sufficient reason to oppose the movement. I can't answer whether that qualifies me as an extremist or not. 

A quick review of Wikpedia will show that Napoleon (1769-1821) was not involved in the War of the Spanish Succession. Questions that can be answered by Wikipedia are likely to be closed on H:SE as trivial or basic facts. 

In my eagerness to write about Hamilton, I missed that the core of the question was the word "competitive". As @T.E.D points out, the use of that word is doubtless influenced by meter and rhyme. I would have to check to see if the playwright's use is supported by contemporary language, but the meaning is that those who have capital and want to lend it are looking for the best deal. Primarily, they want to get their capital back, and with the best mix of risk and reward. One can view this as a competition for the capital. The Articles of Confederation were not competitive credit risks - there was strong evidence that they couldn't even make the interest payments. After Hamilton's reforms, there was enough evidence that the USA was a competitive potential creditor. At the end of the Revolutionary war the United States had a massive war debt (If I recall correctly, it was higher than any time other than the present, or possibly WWII). The new countries primary trade partner was Great Britain, who was reluctant to trade with a country that had a huge war debt to Great Britain and no practical way to pay that debt. The new country was also a Republic - a type of government that was effectively untested (my Dutch ancestors force me to qualify the statement), and there was widespread doubt that the government could be effective - the rest of the world employed some form of Monarchy to maintain order and property rights, and the notion of giving a bunch of debtors the right to vote themselves money from the public purse was perceived as quite insane. Aside: How creditworthy is a republic? 

Even addition and subtraction can be challenging in a pre-decimal pound. If I have a debt of 31L, and I pay 7s2p every year, how long will it take to pay off the debt? I don't have a clear source/citation, but I have always assumed that the checkered pattern served as a form of place value. When there are 13p in a square, remove them all and place 1s in the next square; if that square now hoas 2os, remove and place 1L in the next, etc. The eminent Mr. Geerkens points out: (I'm repeating here only because comments are ephemeral, and the substance is, I think, important enough to be part of the answer.) 

Summary: Scarcity creates an upward pressure on labor compensation. In the absence of a skillfully managed monetary policy, that upward pressure will cause a rise in overall prices (inflation). The question of the economic consequences of the black death is perhaps one of the most fascinating I can imagine. Just as, if not more fascinating, is the interplay of politics and economics, and what we learn about being a human animal. The classical answer This is a classic wage price spiral arising from a supply shock. The death of 1/3 of the laboring class resulted in in a reduction of the supply for labor, and a resulting rise in the demand for labor. According to classical economics the rise in the demand for labor should have caused labor to flow to the affected area. Of course this is also an illustration of where classical economics doesn't apply. Prices (including the price of labor) in the period were set by custom and law. It was illegal for labor to move from one employer to another. Ken Follett described this rather well in Pillars of the Earth (or possibly World Without End; the books blur in my memory). This is an excellent example of public choice economics; those with political power use it to protect their privilege against threats which emerge from economic constraints. See also Rent Seeking 

As Mr. Durden says, any estimate is going to have a very wide range/confidence interval. If you want an answer to the question you asked, you're probably better off asking in a math stack exchange about statistics. Having said that, 10 minutes of research will answer your question. Starting with the page you cite and checking the references, the List of Epidemics, we see that the Plague of Justinian is estimated to have killed 40% of the population. Medieval demography tells us that during late antiquity the population fell from 70 million to 50 million and reached a minimum in response to the Plague of Justinian and the extreme weather events. 70* 0.4 is 28 if you want a low confidence estimate, then you could say that the true number is probably between 28 million and 20 million. (28 million based on the 40% estimate, 20 million based on the population minimum listed in medieval demography). If you want a higher confidence estimate, you'd need to do more research. But as Mr. Durden says, you're never going to reach a high confidence estimate. 

Having said that, google produces multiple entries for the term "twelfth penny" tax - most of them have to do with France, and the few that have to do with the Netherlands are quotes from the works of Thomas Carlyle which are not relevant. If I'm correct, the law was the verpondering. 

The Church of England permitted nonconforming or dissident sects. They were not members of the CoE, but only the Roman Catholics were officially prohibited. @T.E.D. questions whether it was illegal to be Roman Catholic. The situation is not entirely black and white, but 

Is it possible that you're referring to the Frankpledge? That wasn't a group of 12 men, but it was a group of men over the age of 12. Their households were collectively responsible for one another's conduct. For completeness, both @RazieMah & @andy256 point out that the term you're seeking may be tithing, which is a territorial unit (1/10th of a hundred) of people who swear the frankpledge. Credit to them, but I'm updating the answer so that it is a better reference. 

Update: I've edited this answer to expand the material provided and to more precisely address the elements of the question, specifically, what is the factual basis for the accusation? A quick google search for Indian attacks 1605..1776 will reveal multiple attacks. Even if we narrow the range to 1754..1776, there are attacks by Indians on colonists. Trivial Research confirms that the direct reference is to attacks on colonists in Georgia. Did the King provoke these attacks? I think there is legitimate debate. The Colonist's claim arises from Indian attacks on the frontiers. The English crown had guaranteed those lands to the native indian inhabitants; the colonists felt that the lands were theirs. Furthermore, the colonists believed that British officials paid cash for scalps taken from colonist forces: see the following quote from wikipedia 

Let's assume that you are actually asking about a bubble, not a boom. (because if you were asking about a boom, the question would be trivial, since the answer is on Wikipedia). Warning - I'm going to argue that this is a wicked problem - the answer is entirely dependent on which assumptions you treat as credible at the start, and that working with different assumptions, different people can, through rigorous analysis, come to different answers. Unless you clarify the assumptions, the answer is no more useful than "Is Nicole Kidman prettier than Gillian Anderson?" As five different people and you'll get seven different answers, and all of them will be equally right. What is the definition of a bubble? 

As noted by others, he appealed to one of the core Republican demographics (fundamentalists). Wikipedia doesn't note his specific expertise; Senator Quayle had served on the Arms Control and Disarmament committee and from what I understand was perceived as experienced and educated in that field. 

I'm still not sure I understand the question, but I'm going to grope around in the dark in a hopeful manner. Let's look at some examples: 

When I was in college during the last millennium, there was a standard text on this. I believe it was "Why Nations Go to War" by Stoessinger; things may have changed in the new millennium. IO9 provides a traditional top 10 list, which is worth what you pay for it. As the comments have pointed out "power" is a weasely word that can be construed to mean anything- kind of like the ultimate cause of death is heart failure, it is fair to retro-fit "power" to any conflict. You've also used the term "factions" rather than "nations"; I'm not sure why, but let's assume that you want to include civil wars. And finally, why people go to war is often not the reasons they state. The grade school narrative today is that the US Civil War was about slavery, but I think a responsible historical analysis would have to include conflicts that began before the Constitutional convention and that might include differing economic systems (and mutual contempt for one another's economic systems), differing alliances (and mutual contempt thereof), differing agendas (and mutual contempt), etc. Culture, tradition, and isolation all played a part; fundamentally they had divergent, incompatible visions for the future. If I wanted to, I can make the argument that the two factions went to war over the power to determine their own futures, but I don't think that would help me to understand why these two factions went to war. The other weakness with the "power" thesis is that it doesn't help us to predict. What was it that finally forced faction X over the edge from resistance and debate to war? There are endless pages written on the significance of the Archduke Ferdinand to the start of WWI. (I don't know if it is true, but I'm told more people went to the assassin's funeral than the Archduke's.) Matter of fact, WWI might be the counterexample you're looking for. I think the general consensus (with much debate) is that none of the players wanted war, but they all made commitments that wound up making it easier to participate in war than to avoid war. From that standpoint, WWI was not about power. The Revolutionary war would be another good case study; neither side wanted a war. Neither side wanted "power". You could force fit the situation to claim that the Colonials wanted the power of self-determination and Parliament wanted the power of taxation, but I don't think that is a useful framework. OP has edited the question to emphasize power as "energy" - energy was not involved in the start of any of the three wars I've discussed. (the case for backfitting energy into the any of these is even weaker than the case for power). Final comment; there are an infinite number of analytic frameworks one can use to study history. The measure of a good analytical framework is not whether you can or cannot fit examples to the theory, but rather whether the framework improves the understanding. Does it have predictive power? does it help to isolate the critical factors from other factors which are present? I doubt that either "power" or "energy" provide these properties.
