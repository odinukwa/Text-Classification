The same way you cannot make generalizations about the cultures on Earth you will not be able to make generalizations about the cultures of a colonized planet. We have one example of humans occupying a planet. On it there are somewhere on the order of 7,000 languages that have been cataloged. This strongly implies that colonizing a planet isn't sufficient to establish a monoculture. 

There are a few languages on earth that don't have words for relative direction. Instead of they use absolute the directions North, South, East, and West to describe the positioning of things. For example; speakers of these languages when facing East, would refer to their "North foot" and "South foot", and if they turned 90 degrees would refer to their "East foot" and "West foot". The speakers of these languages have been successfully foraging in Australia for at least 40,000 years. If the lack of a concept of relative directions impaired their ability to navigate, the languages would have died out. Other design considerations would dominate the design of their cities, probably building around whatever was built before it became one. 

Yes but not in a way that is useful for your story. Jupiter has permanent storm systems circling the planet, so it's definitely possible. Unfortunately where one storm system ends another begins. The storms on Jupiter are also orders of magnitude stronger than the storms on Earth. Furthermore even modern technology wouldn't be enough to cross a storm of that magnitude. It's a cool idea though. I don't thing your readers would begrudge you handwaving the storm's existence if it makes for a good story. 

There isn't a better remote control system than radio. Unfortunately this leaves any such system vulnerable to all the gremlins in any wireless signal. Long ping times, encryption, and loss of signal are all problems that any remotely controlled system face. There are no ways to overcome this without resorting to autonomous systems in the robot itself. If you want remote controlled robot soldiers in your story you can always handwave it and say something about how advanced quantum mumble mumble effects have revolutionized communication technologies. 

How do the fey deal with hemoglobin in their blood? Whatever your answer to that question is, and I'd strongly suggest handwaving it, will be your answer to how the fey deal with dietary iron. Traditionally it has been the symbolic magical properties of items that have been important, not their chemical ones. Meat isn't metal, neither are leafy vegetables, so for the purposes of symbolic magic the chemical iron won't matter. 

You're talking about hitting someone with an instant cold pack. WebMD recommends keeping a cloth between the ice pack and the skin and limiting exposure to 15-20 minutes. As a weapon it's not going to be very effective. I'm not sure why you'd want to in the first place. Even if you dumped a dewar of liquid nitrogen on someone you'd be looking at some added frostbite. This will be unpleasant to whomever has been stabbed, but the stab wound itself is of much greater and more immediate concern. 

Due to the distances involved any fleet engagement is likely to only occur at or incredibly near to an objective. You mention wormholes as the primary means of travel between 2 star systems. These would be very well defined locations. By extension, the location that a ship could emerge from one would be well known. Because of this those locations can be heavily defended with any type of weapon system you can imagine: large kinetic weapons, space "mines" designed to explode on command, a ring of lasers, etc.. By the same token if an enemy fleet manages to smash through those defenses then it's a matter of stopping them at their destination. Locating and tracking that fleet will be trivial and you'll have plenty of time to muster defenses before they arrive. Are they heading towards that mining space station orbiting a moon? The station will likely have a standing picket fleet to ensure the enemy doesn't get close. Are they heading towards a planet to bombard it? The planet will likely be ringed with defenses designed to kill bombs that are in flight... My point is: these fights will be up close and personal. It will involve not just the ships but relatively static defenses at the target location. There will be no need to chase an enemy fleet around the solar systems - which means the defenders can simply wait them out. All of this means that the likely real world attack profile will be to insert a large landing force that can take and hold the gates around the wormholes thereby establishing a beach head. Once that is done then the attacker would transfer additional personnel and ships in order to launch attacks on other target sites. Each attack would require closing on the target until you can be reasonably assured that you can land regular troops - or that you can launch enough nuclear type weapons to obliterate the target. The defenders goal would be to prevent each location from being taken. The combat would favor the defender because it should be apparent where the enemy would need to be in order to launch their attacks and therefore you could prepare for those attacks well in advance. Again, because the potential locations are known the defender can place weapons at, or very near them ahead of time - easily sidestepping the problem of distance and therefore any of the weapon systems you described are viable. 

Taking a slightly different viewpoint: I could easily envision that multiple companies are producing their own spaceships and 3rd party manufacturers want their devices to be on them. Today it's nearly impossible for a 3rd party to have the exact same GUI experience on multiple devices (iOS/Android/Linux/Windows). However if the app is a CLI then it's trivial for the usage to be near identical. It's also far cheaper to produce and maintain. 

Historically, winning a war isn't always done through stealth or even the usage of actual force. Threat of force, especially in the open, can compel participants to take certain actions. Consider a chess match. Both sides know exactly where each piece is. At the grand master levels, both sides even know a huge range of strategies and usually have researched their opponents prior games before it even starts. Yet, there is a almost always a clear winner. Winning the game comes through maneuvering. Forcing your opponent into a position in which they either cannot stop you from accomplishing your objective or you effectively stop them from completing theirs. In chess all of this is done 100% out in the open, with only the private thoughts of the participants during the match being hidden from view. In war history there have been many battles that were won without a single shot being fired simply due to both commanders recognizing the inevitability of the outcome and reverting back to standard political negotiations. Winning a war would be similar. There would be no surprise attacks, the deployment of forces would be completely out in the open. So, by necessity, both sides would employ generals that acted like chess grand masters. They would keep their thoughts private and wouldn't discuss their strategy with anyone. Rather, they would just issue deployment orders. Sometimes shots would actually be fired because no matter how many simulations you run, there is an element of chance in every endeavor. However, at some point the outcome would be obvious and the war would conclude. 

Not really. In a (horribly reductive) nutshell concrete is essential to modern engineering because it allows us to create an arbitrary shaped rock, on demand, anywhere in the world. Once it's cured it's effectively a weird shaped rock. While rocks are useful for construction there are easier rocks to quarry especially if your post apocalyptic survivors don't have access to the tools necessary to break up concrete. Modern cement will also slowly degrade from exposure to water, making it a poor choice as a structural stone. Like any rock it could be in the way of something, like a field or a foundation. If your survivors are settling an area eventually some of the existing concrete may be in the way of agrarian activities and will need to be moved, probably the minimal distance possible because moving rocks is hard work. 

No a facemask isn't sufficicient to protect a human like being from the vacuume of space. First off such a contraption would only provide breathable gas. That is only one of the functions of a space suit. Such a suit would provide no protection against the vacuum of space, or the extreme temperature differentials experienced during a spacewalk. Since they are exposed to a breathing gas there will be a positive pressure in their lungs. To contain this positive pressure requires a full space suit. When Joseph Kittinger's was glove failed to pressurize during his balloon jump, it swelled up to twice it's normal size and caused him debilitating pain, taking 3 hours to return to normal size. 

I'm unaware of any examples of mammalian inflation. The spines of animals like hedgehogs, porcupines, and echidnas are all made from modified hair follicles. These modified hair follicles allow the orientation of the quills and spines to change from lying flat against the body to erect, pointing in every direction. This will allow the same animal to be perceived as much larger and spikier, similar to why pufferfish inflate. 

Digitize and replicate. Why waste space for storage and preservation on a long journey when you can digitize the occupants and replicate them upon arrival. Any sort of stasis system is going to be complex and require ongoing maintenance power. The advantage of digitizing and replicating the passengers is that all the complex machinery can be left in a powered off state for the journey. 

Spacesuits are designed to keep an individual pressurized in a low pressure environment. What you are looking for is something along the lines of an atmospheric diving suit. They are designed to keep a individual at a much lower pressure than the surrounding environment. It's likely that the suit could be a lot less bulky than a diving hardsuit because the pressure differential is much lower between Earth and Mars than between sea level and 700m below sea level. 

A 4 month time frame is not enough time to analyse, design, produce, and ship the necessary modules to adapt the generation ship to support human life. The existing Mars missions are probably designed with regularly scheduled resupplies, and extensive monitoring from an Earth based mission control in mind. They wouldn't be suited for repurposing for supporting a populations for multiple generations. To put things in perspective it took 8 years to launch the Mars Science Laboratory after the initial request for proposals. 

I think the war is the least of both sides concern. If the only mode of transport has such a drawback then potentially every single ship equipped with an FTL drive is now a huge liability. The moment news of that situation breaks out, commerce and all travel between systems in both empires will grind to a complete and total halt. Mass panic would tear the empires apart from within. No planetary leader would willingly allow an FTL capable ship anywhere near their own planet, and likely not even close to the solar system at all. The companies that make such ships would be torn apart by their own workers in fear. Essentially these empires would break apart into solitary systems. Hopefully the planets within each system are able to be self sufficient. The ones that aren't will die. That one shot and the explosion which followed would be the death knell of both empires and certainly society as either know it. So, the war would end. Not because either side gave up, but because neither would be capable of prosecuting it. 

Yes, war can lead to development of new technologies. However it is by no means the only, or even primary, reason that most technology has been developed. Take a simple thing like the transition from nomadic to agricultural lifestyles. There are many theories about why this occurred, none of which involve war being a motivator. Further, it is arguably one of the greatest changes that early humanity went through and whose technology is still advancing even today. If war was the only driver then we likely would never have made the switch as it's obviously more advantageous to be nomadic in that situation. It is entirely possible that a culture without war never advances beyond a nomadic existence. Generally speaking this means that something is missing from that culture. However, it is entirely possible that a culture without war would be so far advanced that they would appear as gods to us. One thing to consider is that peace is what helped get the renaissance period started. Any period of relaxation for a naturally inquisitive species will lead to testing new concepts and ideas. Examples of drivers include: a population explosion would lead to new ways for collection and distribution of food; while a period of depopulation might lead to innovating ways of keeping entities alive (exa: soap, clean water). Either of those could also lead to inventing written communication - in order to preserve knowledge and transfer knowledge. Eventually this would lead to long distance communication would rise if the need were great enough. So, in the end, war isn't necessary for the advancement of the species. If you look at history, war actually sets all parties back as it causes depopulation of the prime members of the participants, results in upheaval of societies, stops and even destroys most industrial activities, etc. Generally speaking, the cost of large wars far outstrip the benefits received and is a reason why most reasonable leaders use this as a last resort. We can even look at specific inventions credited to war and with a bit of reflection realize that those inventions likely would have come out anyway. If for no other reason than to solve economic hardships.
