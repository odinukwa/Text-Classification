In general, it's best to clear this up as early as possible. An interview situation in which you are on first-name with the interviewer is probably relaxed enough for you to state your preferred name during the introduction, though I wouldn't correct them if they slip up. (I say "probably" because that depends a bit on how you read the interviewer.) In your case, this is slightly more complicated because all the people you talked to in the interview know you by your first name. How to proceed depends a bit on the circumstances. If you talk to different people, you get a new chance for a first introduction: use it. Otherwise correcting an earlier assumption might be awkward. On the other hand, a friendly explanation ("Actually, I prefer to go by Sara but I was so nervous last time I didn't say anything") might also leave a favourable impression. Again, it depends on your interviewers. Either way, when introducing yourself to the team as a group, it's probably best to mention your full name (first and middle name, because some of them know you by your first name) and stress your preference to be called "Sara". When introduced to people one at a time, you can go directly with "Sara" from the start. If you're introduced by someone else, ask them beforehand to introduce you as "Sara". Later on, a few friendly reminders are probably okay, but if your nickname doesn't stick, it's best to just accept that. 

Disclaimer: I don't have prosopagnosia myself, but I do have difficulty remembering both names and faces (to a smaller degree). I feel that the best way to deal with this kind of problem is upfront, i.e. the first time you're introduced to a new person. "I have trouble recognizing faces, so please don't take it personally if I don't recognize you the next time we meet. If you want to talk to me, just say hi." Personally, I wouldn't use the more technical term unless someone asks about it. While people might have heard the term "face blindness", hardly anyone will recognize "prosopagnosia". Since you already have been working with your colleagues for a while, you might want to use a casual chatting situation (going to lunch together, hanging out by the coffee machine) to explain your problem. "By the way, I don't know if you noticed, but I'm unable to recognize faces. When I don't greet (any of) you I don't mean to be rude. I simply don't recognize you." Unfortunately, by now you probably have earned a reputation of being rude and standoffish, but if you explain your handicap often enough, chances are people will be understanding. Also, depending on how many people are in your office, you could just say hi (or nod or whatever) to everyone you meet as a friendly non-committal greeting, at least when you first arrive in the morning. After that, I don't think I ever greet my colleagues when I pass them in the corridor. 

A few members of our current worker's council ("Betriebsrat") are leaving the company, so we'll need to find new candidates. I've discussed this topic with some of my colleagues and it seems like nobody really wants to do the part (including myself) but pretty much everyone agrees that someone should. Because of that I'm at least considering the idea of candidating. I know about the short-term benefits of being in the workers' council (increased job protection etc.), but I'm not going to be in this company forever and I'm worried about the long-term consequences. 

I've never heard of the idea of explicitly answering the "N years of X" question. Usually, that's answered by the CV in which you list your part-time jobs with start and end dates. Finished projects count for a lot! Bonus points if you can link to the websites and/or present testimonials by happy customers. It's not clear how much of your experience consists of private projects, but absolutely list them too. However, if nothing was published or hosted on github etc. that might not count for much. I usually summarize my projects in a single bullet point. Use the cover letter to expound the skills you earned during the projects, both when it comes to coding and soft skills. 

I applied for a position at an institution that's basically the same as the one I currently hold at my job now and they offered me the job today. They low balled me and then when I said I'd need the weekend to consider they called me back and just matched what I was currently making instead of offering me more. At the initial point in time when I applied I was confident that I would take the position anyway for the same amount of money just because it has some slight perks but I was really sure that I would get offered 50k, which is the top of the range for the position. I currently earn 48k and was offered 45k. I was a little surprised to have been offered less than what I currently make because my would-be supervisor was telling me she would need to contact my current boss to get some general information like my current salary so HR could offer something competitive. And now, I think since I was expecting to get offered 50k so confidently (I mean hell it's only 2k more than what I currently make, surely HR departments base their salaries on what someone currently makes?) that it hurt my ego a bit and now im not as sure about taking the job, even though, it has some other incentives. For example they go to a 4 day work week for around 3 months out of the year, during the summer. And i'd have my own office finally. And my boss would actually be someone who values my opinions and inputs instead of brushing me off because I am young. And the last benefit I was considering isn't really a guarantee but there's the possibility of actually getting to work more closely with the IT department at the new employer, and helping them or even doing side projects with them, to get me actual experience for a "real" IT job. But that's just what they said when i interviewed, it could turn out to be quite the opposite. Time is not exactly on either side for the employer or for me. Since they waited until the last minute to do everything I have until 9 AM tomorrow to have a decision because the position needs to be put to the board(it's a community college)so they can approve it and they don't meet but maybe 4 times a year. I was hoping to use this to my advantage. My would-be boss is someone that I very lightly know from a past conference and because she participates in a listserv that I'm a member of. I was thinking of calling her and telling her that HR is pushing a hard bargain and that, while I would really like to work for her, I really need a slightly higher monetary incentive to justify the switch. I'm just not really sure what the best way to approach this whole ordeal is because I am inexperienced with salary negotiations as I have only had 2 professional jobs so far(I am 24). I would like to work at the job I have applied for but it is hard to justify the lateral move in my mind because I expected to be more appropriately compensated for my experience since they really need someone(literally the HR person who called me today said that they called with the "counter" because "Well, we need you. ". The other issue with this is if I ask my would-be boss to "bat for me", and, she is declined, and I decline the position, I end back up in an awkward position with my current supervisor who was in contact with this other employer as aforementioned. The other week my boss told me about how if my job description changed drastically because I took on more responsibilities that she could go ask for more money for me. Well, usually my boss is just blowing smoke out her ass so I place too high of a value on that statement. I mean, it's a nice gesture, but, those aren't the things you plan on in life, you know? You don't make plans around empty promises people make. So I'm afraid that if I don't get the salary I want, and I decline the job, that my boss will be cold towards me. Thank you for any insight you can offer. 

During an internship where you don't expect/intend to stay as a full employee afterwards, there's nothing wrong with interviewing elsewhere to secure a job after the internship ends. If the internship is comparatively short (about 3 months), starting that search even before the internship even starts makes a lot of sense. I agree that cancelling the internship would be akin to reneging on a job you already accepted. (However, if the internship is unpaid, an actual job offer might be a basis to renegotiate to see if it's possible to get at least some pay or shorten the internship.) 

It's absolutely OK to ask this question, same as asking whether it's a technical interview or you're talking to HR. I don't think anyone will hold it against you. I've always asked something along the lines of, "Could you tell me who I will be talking to?" which kills two birds with one stone as not only tells you how many people will take part in the interview but also gives you information about your interview partners (i.e. their position in the company). 

I don't think it makes a difference. The reason people advocate staying for at least 1 year with an employer is that "job hopping" (frequent stints of a couple of months) may raise red flags for prospective employers. Since you've already held your job for 2+ years, there's no reason to stay there "just because". (Unless there's some company-specific reason like getting a bonus or something.) Keep searching for a new job and don't quit until you got accepted (or things get really bad). If your current employment for some reason makes it more likely (same industry etc.) to find your dream job overseas, you may want to stay there until you either find that dream job or a job that's likely to increase these chances. If you've done a lot of job hopping before, take care not to fall back into old habits. 

"Experience with the agile methodology" sounds like something that would be listed among the skills the employer considers "nice to have". But even if it's listed among the "required" skills, if it's the only missing skill, you should apply anyway. The agile workflow is not that difficult and if you're not the one who has to organize it (don't apply for the position of Scrum Coach, for example), it should be easy to pick up. Depending on how strictly you followed the Waterfall model before, it might take some getting used to that development requirements are not set in stone before you start working. That doesn't mean there's no planning at all, but that the initial roadmap is comparatively rough ("we need feature A, feature B and feature C, and each will take roughly 3 months to implement"). A more detailed planning takes place when the time of implementation approaches, and the feature is then "broken down" into smaller portions that can be easily estimated and completed in a much shorter time frame. That means that you'll usually spend several iterations working on the same feature, but again, each iteration is only planned in (even finer) detail shortly before you'll start working on it. The idea behind this is to avoid wasting time planning something that might end up on the cutting table when requirements change in response to already delivered features. That said, as others said, not having experience with the agile methodology does mean that you don't know whether the agile workflow even suits your style of working. Whether that's a problem is up to the employer to decide. And it certainly can't hurt to read up on the theory and the pros and cons of the methodology.
