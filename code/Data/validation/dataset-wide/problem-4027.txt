For the sake of the question, let's ask of a "good" theory of differential topology to have some kind of Morse theory, handle decompositions or surgery theory. I want to know in which fields one can develop such a theory, and how they are related. Common constructions, relations and differences There are quite a few of common constructions, like unit balls and spheres, and projective spaces, which work for different fields and have similar properties. (E.g. as real manifolds, $\mathbb{R}P^n \cong h_0 \cup h_1 \cup \dots \cup h_n$ and $\mathbb{C}P^n \cong h_0 \cup h_2 \cup \dots \cup h_{2n}$.) A lot of the basic questions in complex geometry vs. real differential topology come from looking at $\mathbb{R}$ as a subfield of $\mathbb{C}$, observing the forgetful functor from complex manifolds and real manifolds and asking which constructions and theorems can be lifted the other way. For example, we can ask which real manifolds have an almost complex structure (algebraic topology question), and which have almost complex structures that are integrable. The second question is hard to answer in general, but the questions themselves are straightforward to ask, so I'm wondering whether there is a general theory for asking such questions for arbitrary "differentiable/topological" fields. Complex manifolds have a lot of differences to real manifolds as well, they are much closer to algebraic geometry. (I guess this is similar to the $p$-adic case.) That's interesting, and a big reason why people study them, but not what I'm after. I want to know what they have in common, like in this question. It's not straightforward to study Morse theory on complex manifolds, since a holomorphic function from a complex manifold to $\mathbb{C}$ is constant. But I heard there is an approach to study Morse theory to $\mathbb{C}P^1$, so maybe there's still a common theme here? Questions 

Often, TQFTs are defined in families, parametrised by some algebraic data. For example, the Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury TQFTs are parametrised by spherical fusion categories, the Crane-Yetter TQFTs are parametrised by ribbon fusion categories, and the $n$-dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory is parametrised by a finite group $G$ and an $n$-cocycle $\omega$. Instead of regarding TQFTs with a fixed datum as an invariant of manifolds (and cobordisms), one can also fix a manifold and regard a family of TQFTs as invariant of the parametrising data. For example, the Crane-Yetter invariant of $\mathbb{CP}^2$ is the "Gauss sum" $\sum_X d(X)^2 \theta_X$ of the ribbon fusion category, where $X$ ranges over simple objects and $\theta$ is the twist eigenvalue. (I'm thanking Ehud Meir for making me appreciate this viewpoint.) From this viewpoint, my question is: In the Dijkgraaf-Witten TQFT, which manifolds give invariants that are sensitive to the cocycle? In details, let us define the following invariant: $$ DW_{G,\omega}(M) = \sum_{\phi\colon \pi_1(M) \to G} \int_M \phi^* (\omega)$$ Here, $M$ is an $n$-manifold, $\omega \in H^n(G,U(1))$ is an element of the $n$-th group cohomology, and $\phi^*\colon H^n(G,U(1)) \to H^n(M,U(1))$ is induced by the flat $G$-connection $\phi$. I'm looking for a manifold $M$ such that $DW_{G,\omega}(M) \neq DW_{G,\omega'}(M)$ for some $\omega \neq \omega'$. Ideally, the example would be in 3 or 4 dimensions. 

Dagger categories generalise involutive monoids in the same way groupoids generalise groups. Bottom line: In my opinion, dagger structures are the same kind of structure as "composition structures". The natural definition is pointwise and the equality on objects arises as a typing constraint. It just so happens that one can see them as functors as well, and that definition is then evil. But the natural definition is perfectly fine, and the terminology "evil" does not apply. 

Consider the category where objects are strict spherical fusion categories and morphisms are strict spherical functors (preserving cups and caps). I am wondering whether there is some kind of image factorisation possible in this category, similar to finite groups, where every homomorphism can be written as a composition of an epimorphism and a monomorphism. 

It is a theorem by Spivak that every Poincaré duality space has a Spivak normal fibration, unique up to homotopy equivalence. This is remarkable, since a Poincaré duality space will in general not even have a tangent or normal bundle. 

Generalising Omar's answer, braided monoidal categories are (a special case of) tricategories with one 1-morphism. Symmetric monoidal categories are tetracategories (whatever that is) with one 2-morphism. Writing these correspondences out explicitly, you should be able to work out the $\omega$-nerve of the underlying $\omega$-category (Ross Street's work with orientals). Actually, following Street's approach, an $\omega$-category already is a simplicial set and one would expect that you can expect a tricategory to be just an $\omega$-category where all the $n$-morphisms are identities above 3. I believe the Duskin nerve is just taking a bicategory as an $\omega$-category following Street's approach and then considering its nerve. 

Motivation: Surfaces Closed oriented 2-manifolds (surfaces) are "classified by their homotopy type". By this we mean that two closed oriented surfaces are diffeomorphic iff they're homotopy equivalent. This means that somehow the homotopy type of the surface contains essentially all information about the manifold. Let's turn the question around. Let's choose a homotopy type $M$, and ask whether it specifies a manifold. I have to be more precise by what I mean here. First of all, let's fix a dimension, say 2 for now, although we can increase it later. Of course not every homotopy type will correspond to a surface. There a some restrictions on $M$, such as: 

In the quantum harmonic oscillator, there exists a family of states called coherent states which form an overcomplete set of states. They are regarded as "the states most resembling classical states", in that their parameter satisfies the classical equation of motion of the harmonic oscillator. Multiple generalisations exist to diverse situations and have proven useful. In TQFTs, we have Hilbert spaces and evolution operators as well, so do we also have coherent states of some sort? What are they being used for? Bonus: Are there categorified versions of these in extended TQFTS? 

One can define the category of subobjects of $Z$, where the objects are subobjects of $Z$ and the morphisms have to commute with the monomorphisms of the subobjects. In this category, $S$ is simply the product of $X$ and $Y$. 

I'm surprised nobody has mentioned Jeff Eggers "On involutive monoidal categories", which generalises Peter Selingers work, I guess. It's an excellent article, and it connects to other special cases. The idea is as follows: A strict involutive monoidal category is a monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$ with a covariant (!) involution functor $\overline{(\;)} : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}$. It has to satisfy $\overline{\overline{X}} = X$ and $\overline{X \otimes Y} = \overline{Y} \otimes \overline{X}$. (Actually one may consider the non-strict version, but there is a coherence theorem.) These categories have just the right structure to define what an internal $*$-algebra is. Basically, an involution (such as the $*$-structure) of an object $X$ is a morphism $X \to \overline{X}$. For example, antilinear maps arise in that way. But note that $\overline{X}$ is usually not the dual of $X$, nor does it need to be isomorphic to $X$ or its dual. But Selinger's example is a special case of this framework, it seems, as are Dagger pivotal categories. Now comes the (half-)twist. It is a natural transformation $\zeta: \overline{(\;)} \implies 1_\mathcal{C}$, satisfying some simple conditions. The punchline: Like Noah Snyder's and Peter Tingley's work would make you believe, such a half-twist will give rise to a ribbon category. The twist is given by $\zeta\overline{\zeta}$, the braiding is $(\zeta \otimes \zeta)\zeta^{-1}$. Egger also explains the graphical calculus, it all makes sense. Involutive monoidal categories are, up to notation, the same as Majid's and Begg's Bar categories.
