Technical note: A symbol IN a coat of arms is always within a field of a specific color that has a obvious edge or border. The field may be a shield or a roundel or a cartouche or a flag or a medieval surcoat (thus the phrase "coat of arms"). In this case the shield is divided into four quarters, and the second and third quarters are red, with three gold lions passant. Symbols within one or more of the quarters are the only symbols that can be called "IN" the coat of arms. The shield is being held up by 2 white lions that are called supporters and are part of what is called an "achievement" (complete display) of arms. As an example, the COAT OF ARMS of the United States of America is white with six red vertical bars and a blue horizontal area at the top. The ACHIEVEMENT OF ARMS of the United States of America has the coat of arms on a shield on the breast of a bald eagle displayed in natural colors with an olive branch in one claw and thirteen white arrows in the other claw. The eagle holds a ribbon with a motto in its beak and there is a "glory" with thirteen white stars on a blue field above the eagle's head. Thus the eagle is not "ON" the coat of arms because the coat of arms is on a shield on the eagle's breast. In Edward IV's achievement of arms the white lions are not ON the coat of arms or IN the coat of arms or ON the achievement of arms but are part of and thus more or less IN the achievement of arms. Someone was nice enough to answer the question you intended to say, but the question that you actually wrote (copying an earlier statement) literally has no correct answer since there are no white animals ON that coat of arms. 

$URL$ That translates roughly as: "Most serene Emperor Charles, by God crowned Great Peaceful Emperor, ruling the Roman Empire, and by the Grace of God King of the Franks and the Lombards". So Charlemagne claimed to be the Roman Emperor, and the most important part of the ideology about Roman Emperors is that they Were the rightful rulers of EVERYWHERE and EVERYONE. So how could a tiny little realm like Andorra, right at the edge of a mighty state - or even surrounded by the territories of that state - whose aggressive and expansive ruler claimed to be the rightful ruler of EVERYWHERE and EVERYONE get acknowledged as an independent realm by that mighty state and its ruler? That seems like an impossible event. Recognition of the independence of Andorra would seem to be impossible until such time as nether of its neighbors in Spain and France was the Emperor and thus compelled to claim lordship everywhere he could. In 988, the Count of Urgel, a semi-independent ruler in Catalonia, gave Andorra to the Bishops of Urgel in Catalonia, who later became subjects and vassals of the Crown of Aragon. In 1095 the Bishop of Urgel and the Lord of Caboet in Catalonia signed a treaty making them co-rulers of Andorra. In 1278 a conflict between the Bishop of Urgel (by then a vassal of the King of Aragon) and the Count of Foix (by then a vassal of the King of France), the heir to the Lord of Caboet, was settled and they continued to share the lordship over Andorra. The heirship of the Lord of Caboet descended from the Count of Foix to the Kings of Navarre. Henry of Bourbon became King Henri III of Navarre in 1572 and King Henri IV of France in 1589. In 1607 he issued an edict making the head of the French state co-prince of Navarre along with the Bishop of Urgel, thus transferring the overlordship of Andorra from his Kingdom of Navarre to his Kingdom of France. I suppose that after 1607 all the rulers of France considered Andorra to be another country that they were the (Co) sovereigns of and thus felt they didn't need to make Andorra part of France to have some authority over it. To make an already long story short, I suspect that the exact answer to when Andorra became recognized as an independent state would be found in the diplomatic files of various European states, most importantly its neighbors France and Spain.

I think you are formulating the debate in the wrong terms. There were Japanese who correctly believed that the war was lost, nukes or no nukes. There also were Japanese, who believed that an honorable settlement was still possible, through some far fetched pipe dream scheme like Soviet mediation or Kamikaze pilot wild successes. Nukes gave the former a decisive argument against the latter. It did not really matter how many more bombs the US had. What did matter was that the latter group of Japanese leaders could no longer deny that their near future involved a complete extermination. 

A greenhouse requires glass (or, these days, plastic). This is fairly expensive, especially 90 years ago, especially in Russia. They make sense when land is scarce and any measure to improve its productivity pays. This was not the case in Russia. Much lower hanging fruits are

This was the only natural and generally acceptable solution, similar to the solution taken after the British empire's dissolution. Just like it would have been absurd to make the UK share the UNSC veto power with the British Commonwealth countries (erstwhile colonies), it would have been absurd to make Russia share the UNSC veto power with the Commonwealth of Independent States. Observe that the above inheritance is a "package" called "Assignment", i.e., one can hardly expect Russia to get some but not all of these items. Who would want a different solution? 

I'm thinking of really unusual uses, such as Odysseus' use of Cyclops' sheep to hide under in Odyssey, except in real well documented historical situation. Ideally I'm looking for a good (well referenced) single resource such a book or web page on animal use for military purposes; or a single "yes" answer with strikingly unusual/unexpected example. Extra plus if the use was either a spectacular one-time success, or a stable practice for a specific culture/location/commander. 

It's a bit of a long write-up, but the best reason is fairly easy to trace on a map. The southern border of Russia between Caspian and Black seas is pretty defenseless as far as natural features (same is true for other borders). So historically, Russia worked/fought to extend its borders to defensible ranges, in case of this specific area, the Greater Caucusus Mountains range that extends from around Sochi on Black sea to NorthEast corner of Azerbaijan on Caspian sea. This is not really an academic exercise, since historically, that region was strongly threatened by fairly expansionist Ottoman Empire and modern day Turkey (see larger Wiki map for good visual). Russia fought a whole bunch of wars with Ottomans/Turks, and given modern geopolitics, is still strongly competing with Turkey, which is on the accendant path in the region/world. The of course ties into access to Caspian resources, especially oil (notice that if you lose Chechnya, you will possibly lose Dagestan, meaning the whole western Caspian seaboard). 

What was the first big scale (over 50 tanks used) battle with the use of tanks in WW1? Please note that the typical examples don't constitute good answer: 

There were not many strictly monotheistic faiths in general before 1700 which lasted (3 main Abrahamic ones, Zoroastrians, Sikhism (possibly, not too familiar)). Worship of Aten in Egypt only lasted for ~20 years so doesn't count. Ba'hai are post 1700. Sabians can probably be considered monotheistic, but as far as I know never held any territorial soveregnity to be in a position to engage (ore refrain from) conflict with polytheistic religions. Of the 3 Abrahamic ones, Judaism cannot be counted as fitting the question, by definition, because it is NOT expansionist in religious terms (Judaism prohibits both prozelatyzing and forced conversion). Islam is explicitly hostile to polytheism. So is state-merged, post-Nicean post-Constantine Christianity.

Short answer: "The Present". Shorter answer: "Now". Longer answer: "The date in the dating system used in their time and place. Or so many thousands of years since the biblical creation of the world. For example the Medieval Jewish calendar dated the creation to 3761 BC, and the medieval Byzantine calendar dated the creation to 5509 BC. Thus a Byzantine Christian and Jew could disagree about the age of the universe by 1,748 years. 

At the time, England and France recognized the religious authority of the Church. At the time, the popes claimed to be the rightful secular rulers of all the world. But most medieval kings never recognized such claims to political authority, except when the pope happened to be on their side in a dispute. 

In an article about the Column of Trajan I read that the Romans temporarily adopted arm armor (like that used by some gladiators) during the Dacian War because some of the allies of the Dacians were known for cutting off arms in battle - "disarming" their enemies. 

There is no minimum age for a kid to be officially enlisted in a military unit without performing any duties and with the parent drawing his salary as a form of graft. No doubt babies have been officially enlisted. Judging by several examples from significantly different times and places, it is possible for a child as young as five to be a soldier in some real sense, usually as a trainee. The absolute minimum age to perform different types of combat actions is determined by the different ages at which different boys are large and strong enough to perform those different types actions reasonably well. However, it is certainly possible for a soldier to perform military functions as part of a combat unit without fighting, and thus without needing to be capable of fighting. Drummer boys in western armies up to the late 19th century are a good example of young non combatant soldiers who sometimes performed non combatant military duties during combat and under enemy fire. During the US Civil War drummers included men of all ages and boys of more ages - some of them younger ages - than would seem possible. The very few youngest musicians who enlisted -including some who served for long times and seemed reasonably successful and useful soldiers - enlisted as young as nine and eight. It would certainly be rarer and rarer for samurai to fight in battle at ages younger and younger than the usual age range, since they would be less and less likely to be physically able, and trained well enough, to fight. But participation in battles, campaigns, sieges, and other military operations has never been limited to those who fight in the strictest sense. Therefore it seems certain that some samurai boys (as well as commoner boys) participated in battles, campaigns, sieges, and other military operations before they were old enough or expected to fight. At the very highest level Antoku-tenno never fought but was present at the Battle of Dan-no-ura. 

When a war starts, the diplomats lock down the embassy and leave through a neutral country. They are neither molested nor harassed, and their diplomatic immunity is not disputed. The embassy building and the property therein is taken care of by the neutral country representing the interests of the belligerent (or some other arrangements may be made). The major point is that both belligerent nations recognize that the war is a temporary affair in their long-term relationships and that a decent treatment of diplomats serves both sides. One exception I know of is the treatment of the Polish diplomats in USSR in the fall of 1939 after Poland was divided between Germany and USSR. They were allowed to leave USSR (for England via Romania) unmolested, but as private citizens. I.e., the USSR made an effort to demonstrate that Poland is not a Nation anymore. Still, Romanians were allowed to take care of the Polish embassy building &c. Related: What became of Nazi Germany's embassies in neutral countries?

The US ultimatum threatened war unless Unrestricted submarine warfare was abandoned. A war can be won either by crashing an opponent on the battlefield or by strangling it economically. Submarine warfare is the strangulation approach. I.e., when applying it, one has to calculate long term effects. The pro of unrestricted submarine warfare is a better blockade of Britain (and France). The contra is the addition of the resources of the USA to the already formidable combination of Britain, France and Russia. The German General Staff decided that in 1915 the costs were larger than the benefits. 

Texas was de facto independent for 10 years(!) until the Mexican-American War. Russian troops entered the Ukrainian province of Crimea in the spring of 2014, then rigged a "referendum". Russia guaranteed the Ukrainian borders in 1994, then violated its own guarantees 20 years later. The borders between Mexico and the US in the early 19th century were much more nebulous: they were the outcome of the Seven Years' War and defined borders between France and Spain. Texas was empty of both Mexicans and Americans early in the 19th century (there were Amerindians there, but they "do not count" for the purposes of this question). Americans colonized it faster than the Mexicans did, then seceded. The population of Crimea has been relatively stable for many decades (after the Stalin's deportations), and has been a recognized part of Ukraine for half a century.

I can't quite make out what's being asked, but if my guess about the meaning is correct, the developments in technology brought about by capitalist and/or free market competition models are in no way restricted to those driven by war needs. Some very random examples: 

I wasn't able to find great cites for this, but many popular accounts credit Count of Tilly's dramatic loss to Gustav Adolph of Sweden at Battle of Breitenfeld to the fact that his second in command Graf Pappenheim leading the heavy Black Cuirassiers prematurely - and against orders - attacked Gustav's flank (being routed in the process), which in turn freed Gustav's cavalry to go after and capture Imperial artillery. Tilly was born February 1559; and Pappenheim May 29, 1594, making them ~35 years apart (Making Tilly 72 in 1631, and Pappenheim 37). 

As you have correctly implied, you can NOT equate these terms. Among other reasons, because the first couple are economic systems and the latter are political. There are certain correllations and causations betwene them, however. Just as a note, your question is nearly impossible to answer for 4 reasons: 

Please note that the above statements are un-cited on Wiki; but they fully match with the way history was taught in USSR, where any period in any country preceding Capitalist system was called "feudal" - basically meaning "medieval, pre-capitalist in Marxist interpretation of history". I was able to find the following reference: 

Please note that I'm not merely seeking individual examples not covered by the Wiki, but more interested in how widespread the situation was than in having 1-2 specific examples, and reasons for why not (Salic law?). The time period I'm interested in is 500CE=>1800CE. - this excludes House of Saud, or Tabloid Dynasty. By "sizeable monarchies", I mean dynasties which lasted for at least 3 generations, and controlled a territory larger than 500,000 km2 or a population over 100,000.
