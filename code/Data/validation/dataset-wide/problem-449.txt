CO2 partial-pressure is also a big deal for humans. If it's too high, CO2 won't diffuse out of the bloodstream back into the air in the lungs, leading to changes in blood acidity as more CO2 builds up. CO2 toxicity is a thing. It's nowhere near as bad as carbon monoxide, and I haven't yet found a reliable number on CO2 partial pressure that would be dangerous. What I've found so far suggests that increasing oxygen partial-pressure wouldn't compensate for increased CO2 partial-pressure very much or at all. 

Remember that the shell theorem only holds with $1/r^2$ forces, so a short-range force will tend to pull Air elementals into the sky when they're on the ground. If it's stronger than gravity, they'd have to actively fly downwards or hold onto things to stay at surface level. 

It would cause the price of gold to crash, making your pile of gold essentially worthless. Others would gobble it up and then slowly filter it back into the market as the gold price stabilises, making a killing. Which is what you should have done yourself in the first place of course... This isn't limited to gold, it goes for any commodity. The question is discussed in some detail in discussions about the viability of asteroid mining, where it is sometimes suggested that the haul in precious metals from a single large asteroid would quickly be able to pay for the cost of the entire operation by just dumping it on the market. For all the reasons already mentioned, that's not how it works. You'd rather have to release those tons of rare materials (platinum for example) in small batches, say a few percent of the yearly demand, unless maybe you were to at the same time introduce a new and highly lucrative use for those materials, which would increase demand to the point where a high market price can be sustained despite a greatly increased supply. 

Water density in the air is peanuts compared to a nearby ocean, even during a heavy rainstorm. A $1/r^3$ or $1/r^4$ force would make the effect of a storm more significant. A water elemental leaving the ocean is like a human climbing a mountain. It's "uphill" all the way from the centre of mass of the ocean. Being at the edge of the ocean is like a human having climbed up a vertical shaft from the centre of the Earth. However, the ocean is more like a thin disc than a sphere of water, so getting to the edge takes you farther from more of it. Unlike climbing outward from a sphere (where your weight will peak at the surface), your weight will probably drop off some as you approach the shore (especially since coastal water is shallower). However, with a $1/r^2$ force, the difference between getting to the edge and going another kilometre beyond is less significant than with a sphere. You're already pretty far from most of the water, so the total pull you feel doesn't drop off as much with distance from the shore. (So again, a $1/r^2$ force isn't going to give you much of a "break free of the ocean" effect). If a Water elemental can "climb" more easily through water than by walking on land, it's going to be much easier to leave the ocean by going up-river until they're near an equilibrium between a large lake and the ocean. 

But forget about that. If gravity goes down, the atmosphere becomes less dense. Which would have a big effect on winds, oxygen levels (thus plant growth, animal life, etc. etc.). Temperatures would go down, further hurting plant and animal life, which likely has even greater negative effects as it would mean more desert style areas. 

A more realistic scenario would have said laser be positioned in a high orbit around the earth and project its messages onto the planet through a series of blinds and stencils. If the radiation can be used to excite inert gasses in the upper atmosphere you could even create something that stays visible for some time after turning the lasers off again. Of course aviation authorities, environmental agencies, and owners of other objects in orbit aren't going to like you. It's going to play havoc with all kind of equipment, think what happens when there's a major outbreak of solar flares causing disruption of the atmosphere... 

Another plausible explanation for scaling different than inverse-square: extra spatial dimensions. i.e. direction(s) that Elemental stuff can move in that's perpendicular to x, y, and z. Inverse-square scaling happens because the area of a sphere scales with the square of radius. In 4-dimensional space, the analog of a sphere has a 3-D analog of area (actually a volume) that scales with the cube of radius. So if the force (and force-carrying virtual particles) spread out in a 4th spatial dimension, it would scale as $1/r^3$. And you can still use the word "gravity" if you like. Real theories have been proposed with properties like this, especially String Theory's extra dimensions which are "rolled up" / curved back on themselves, which limits the strength of the effect. One proposed effect is/was gravity being slightly weaker than $1/r^2$ over astronomical scales. For this case, presumably it's a dimension that only Elementals can move in, not ordinary matter. So it can have a strong effect on Elementals without affecting normal physics. Perhaps moving in this dimension takes you between worlds, or between elemental planes and Earth. Of course, it's easy to introduce inconsistencies if you aren't careful. (e.g. if there are lots of Elementals only a couple km away, they would exert some pull on Earth's air / water / fire / earth. (Assuming this force affects the inert element with an equal and opposite force to what the Elemental feels, otherwise you're violating conservation of momentum and conservation of energy.) Anyway, safer to just have the force carrying particles / fields spread out into the extra dimension(s), and not have the Elementals able to move along it. Otherwise they could bypass walls by going around them using this extra dimension, and stuff like that. 

Don't use it in places where the enemy may gain access to the device. This is pretty much standard procedure where feasible. For example the first Meteor jets the Brits built during WW2 (yes, the first units were active before the war ended) were barred from flying over German held territory to prevent the aircraft from falling into enemy hands if it were to crash. Similarly, early radar equipped aircraft owned by both sides were not allowed to overfly enemy held areas. In both cases of course the security was moot as the other side already had similar or identical technology, but that was in both cases not known (though suspected no doubt). Also, you keep the people involved strictly incommunicado (or try to at least). That's how the secrets of Bletchly park and the Manhattan project were kept until well after the war. Not just was the machinery involved (early computers, nuclear weapons technology...) top secret to the point nobody except a few key people knew what they were working on or with, but those people were housed in remote areas with no contact with the outside world that wasn't strictly censored (and despite that, the Soviets were still able to steal the nuclear technology from the Americans by infiltrating...). Having a good story to explain the effects without exposing your secrets is core to the disinformation campaign that's going to be needed. So if you've broken the enemy's ciphers, be prepared to spread rumours about secret agents inside their security agencies. If you've a new weapon, invent stories about something else that'd people could believe can do the same thing. In the ultimate scam, invent and build entire labs and fake experiments and make sure the enemy gets wind of their "successes". The biggest hoax of all that was perpetrated like that was the US Space Defence Initiative (SDI/Star Wars) which never existed as such (or rather, never was more than a paper study, but fake experiments were staged to make the Soviets think that working prototypes existed of weapons entirely different from what was being studied and were ready for deployment). Smoke and mirrors... 

Other answers have addressed the issue of O2 partial-pressure that humans can tolerate. I want to point out other potential issues. Oxygen is very reactive. The higher the oxygen content, the easier it is for a fire to start / spread. And anything that can oxidize will do so more quickly when exposed to the atmosphere. A 100% oxygen atmosphere is not very plausible, AFAIK. I don't think any naturally-evolving life could maintain it, since it would always be reacting with things to produce other gases (e.g. CO2). 

I don't think you should consider less than Earth sea level total pressure, since a dangerously-high O2 partial pressure for humans would make it even more than 60% of the total gas, and then you'd need a mechanism to explain that. 

If by mine you mean a fixed or semi fixed single use automated defense system, they could work. If you mean a big bag of explosives that goes BOOM when something triggers the detonator, not so much. 

So your ecosystem would have to be such that megafauna exists, and has the plant and animal life for it to feed on, in order to sustain the shark population. The few blue whales (and other large whales) in our oceans will probably not do, they're too few and far between to provide reliable sources of sustenance to a viable population of megasharks. 

People will no longer trust banks, money becomes useless as a means of paying for goods and services as it has no value. People fall back to systems of barter for services and goods. Maybe some will accept valuables in trade for services, which they then trade on for other goods and services. In time banking will reappear, but only hard records, written on paper, will be acceptable as proof of ownership of anything. Which brings us to the linked implication, which is that any computerised system will be viewed with extreme suspicion. It is quite likely a large part of the population will demand a complete ban on computers, maybe even a complete ban on any electronic equipment, because they're afraid of them (many people already are, this would give them an excuse). 

This Elemental force (E-gravity? gravitee? Etraction?) doesn't attract plain water to other plain water, for example. This means that buoyancy doesn't happen with respect to this force, because the displaced plain water wasn't affected by that force. (i.e. there's no extra pressure created by it). We know this because Newtonian mechanics + fluid dynamics can accurately model the Earth's oceans (e.g. sea level heights around the world, and the deformation of the oceans due to Earth's spin rate). I think our models are detailed enough that we would have noticed if water attracted other water more than gravitationally, rather than just got the wrong value for some other free parameter. Buoyancy due to gravity can overcome gravity + the extra force, if they're in the same direction, otherwise not. 

The virus used there seemed believable, and the distribution method ingenious. Little spoiler: he went for a genetically hardened version of Ebola, with a very clever way of distributing it (which I won't mention, read the book). He touches on the same issue in Executive Orders, using a completely different distribution system. 

genetics is a good start. A certain mix of genes together determines whether the body has the means to perform magic (and one of those genes is recessive on the X chromosome). Diet may have something to do with it as well. Maybe the planet grows a plant which contains a chemical that when consumed suppresses magical ability (or conversely, enhances it). You can play with that in several scenarios, see what happens. For example a person needs to be genetically inclined towards magic while also having a rare genetic disorder making her allergic to that plant so she can't eat it (while it is staple food, and thus consumed by the vast majority of the population on a near daily basis). But even if the latent power is there, training is also needed to unlock it, and a long standing taboo on performing magic in many rural communities (where the genetic makeup needed is most prevalent) makes practicing magic something most people will never consider. Your recruiters will have to scour the land, visiting villages and looking over the young girls for signs (who knows what those are, maybe the rare allergy leaves them with discoloured eyes). 

If you want more of a "break free" effect, maybe have the force proportional to $1/r^3$ (inverse cube, like the force between two magnets) instead of the usual inverse square (gravity, electrostatic force). Or even $1/r^4$ or whatever you want. It can still scale linearly with mass the way gravity (${G M m}/{r^2}$) does, you just vary the scaling with distance. That would also make it plausible for small nearby things (like fireballs) to have more of an effect than the Sun's pull. (Which only affects fire Elementals, not the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so would tend to pull fire Elementals off the surface during the day, counterbalanced by the pull of magma and stuff underground). It's completely plausible for a force to have very different scaling with distance than gravity. Just don't call it gravity! For example, the Weak nuclear force is very short-range because the force-carrying particles have non-zero rest mass (unlike the photons that carry the electromagnetic force. This is why the electroweak force is unified at high energies: there is enough free energy for pair-production of the force carriers, so they can pop up like photons). I'm not saying you should go into that much detail (better to be vague than obviously wrong to people that know the subject), just that non-gravity-like forces happen without magic. So you could even have a force that's more or less inverse-square over short ranges, but falls off dramatically at a certain distance. There have also been proposed theories of gravity that modify it slightly over astronomical distances to explain things like the Pioneer (space probe) anomaly. (That's now pretty conclusively explained by thermal radiation pressure, ruling out some of the gravitational theories.)
