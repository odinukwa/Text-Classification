Adding graphene will make the bones stronger but it will not make them any lighter. You can't reduce the animal's weight by switching out the bone material because then it needs to store that calcium and phosphorous in some other fashion, you can't eliminate them only move them. living things with muscle need a very narrow range of calcium concentration in the body to function. Having a solid mass of calcium's distributed around the body is the most efficient way to do that. Dinosaurs, birds, and pterosaurs, make bones hollow to make a larger structure for the same weight, the total ratio of bone surface area to body mass remains the same. In fact you really can't change that ratio very much because the bone surface area (exposed to body tissue) cant change much. $URL$ So your dragon bones will be stronger, but you won't drop any weight. 

not significantly, bone density is not a really good measure of strength. tool use will be hindered by a climbing anatomy, you can have a hand optimized for climbing or for tools not both, it may be hindered if you make the muscles stronger as fine motor control may be affected. since the only information we have is "stronger" their weight is kinda up to you. I will say with that height they will not be great climbers, humans are already too heavy for it. intelligence and climbing do not appear to be related so no. Yes endurance will suffer, human endurance is so good becasue we evolved for long distance bipedal travel, these have evolved in the opposite direction. Again with just "stronger" this is up to you. reaction time is not related to any of this so they will reacts as fast as humans which is normal for animals our size, size is the major factor as it controls the length of the nerve signal, smaller animals react quicker becasue the signal has a shorter distance to travel. of course they will be a bit slower in the limb but that is a fairly minor thing unless they a throwing something, and will not impact reaction time. this depends entirely on how much you change them to be better climbers, long legs are not good for chimp style climbers but good for jumpers. Humans are good jumpers, chimps are not, so if they still have human like legs they will be good jumpers. Likely around the same as a humans. 

does it have to be natural evolution? they could have messed with their own genome. the only animals that have no aggressive behavior have little chance to evolve intelligence, either they breed to fast to be able to waste resources on intelligence, , or they are so difficult to kill they never needed to evolve social behavior, ex: turtles. Part of evolving intelligence is having a wide range of behavior, even Niven's famous puppeteers were violent under the right circumstances, they just a massive pervasive cultural bias against violence. Which is actually quite believable, and it is fairly easy to imagine a species that is less violent than humans. Now image such a species with access to genetic engineering they might eliminate violent behavior entirely that way. So start with a low aggression species and then let the mess with their own genome too much. 

Economics Assuming changing is largely free, some bodies will offer more economic opportunity, a large portion of your poorest people will be forced into changing just due to economic circumstances. This may very well be your largest factor. Dwarves and mechanical aptitude, flying races, attractive elves, water breathing, temprature tolerances, night vision in general, each offers new economic opportunities to your person. It is the same reason the poor were often the most likely to go to colonies or move in unsettled areas historically. If they get to pick their race this is several orders of magnitude more powerful, since people will try to match skills or desires with the new race. 

Larry niven came up with an interesting idea for dealing with aliens that live at different timeframe references. They communicate via E-mail and digital media, you can read and answer at your own speed. Your speedster might need to build a custom rig (shes got the time)and type slowly but it should be possible. Electronics can be built for extremely high speed interface. 

Terry Pratchett's dark side of the sun has several, they are called joker artifacts and are the leftover signatures of a precursor races. examples include, a stable ring of mutually orbiting stars, a protostar with inside out planet inside it, a neutron star core that has had tunnels cut through it creating a gravity maze, and the planet Band described thusly. "Band spins on its axis so fast that the equator has a noticeable bulge to it. It looks like a solid gas giant with a twenty-five thousand mile wide band of mountains at the equator, edged by two strips of of grassland which are edged by two strips of sea which end at the circles of ice on the poles." It appears to be a planet sized wildlife preserve. It also contains the First Sirian Bank a 7000 mile tidally locked asteroid composed of a combination metal impurities and fault lines to create a sentient supercomputer powered by the thermal gradient between the light and dark side. The trick is to think of something that is technically possible but just so extremely unlikely it could never happen naturally. Like planet surrounded by moons make of regular geometric solids or a planetary system where each planet is identical. 

I don't see how it is an issue. Just becasue they have forgotten where the term russian came from does not mean they do not have russians who identify as russians. Russian cultural can survive even if Russia is forgotten. How many people in the US don't know anything about their ancestral home but still identify as scottish or french, ect. Cultural practices can stick around long after their origins are long forgotten. 

massive ash clouds from the molten rock, if it hits an icesheet the ash is even worse. Every existing fault line on earth experiences severe earthquakes which also causes tsunami all over the globe. Every volcano with any pressure erupts, this plus the ash blots out the sun for days.this also cause widespread acidic rain. If it hits at the right angle you also might get a new volcano forming on the other side of the planet. honestly the asteroid is not as bad as all the earthquakes and volcanoes the shock wave triggers. 

There already is an animal that can lift that it is called a male gorilla, at least according to the GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORD'S 1975 edition rough calculations based on observed throwing strength. Consider the strongest humans can deadlift 1000lbs, and pound for pound the other apes are about twice as strong as us. Of course realistically they would not be able to balance with such a weight over their heads and would topple over, they just are not built for that kind of lifting, so no throwing. Scale up to something like Gigantopithecus giganteus (4-700lbs) in it should be able to do it with no issue, whether or not it can lift it over its head. Now that assumes 10ft is where it stops not here it impacts. If they are throwing it to hit something then no, it is not realistics, it might be at half the mass of the projectile or twice the mass of the creature. But even then it is pushing it, nor is it going to be very fast at it. Including a study guessing why chimps are so much stronger, they are trading speed and endurance for strength. 

see literally all of europe's colonial period. Just have it be a left over from one of these periods, like Canada before 1982. becasue a smaller country really can't take over a much larger country unless there is a significant technology or infrastructure gap. Or as a different option you could have another third party country do the bulk of the damage but lose and then have the smaller country sweep in afterwards taking advantage of the infrastructure gap in the damaged larger country. You need a pretty significant war though. Basically create an infrastructure gap with a third party. 

here is a study on the current research into producing such things biologically. $URL$ there biggest worry is that they are still going to go blind for a second, especially with the recovery time on the photochrome. but for that level of genetic engineering you should be looking at more than a few decades, it's one thing to engineer a zygote, but an adult soldier will be much harder. 

yes the egg layers would radiate into a wide range of niches and forms. The big thing is no whales or dolphins since they will still have to come out on to land to lay eggs. 

It depends on a lot of things, like climate and how long the building is exposed vs buried. nothing is going to survive a million years of exposure but a cut stone building like the pyramids might survive a million years buried in the right climate, a million years exposed not a chance, the the effects of night and day light fluctuation will destroy it. A billion years can grind several miles off a mountain so a building does not stand a chance especially considering how mich the climate might change in that amount of time, Antarctica was a jungle 60 million years ago. Consider this chart, you want to keep yourself in the "slight weathering" area. 

You could make one, it would need a carbon fiber body with C4 filler,it has to be light to work. It would need some kind of wireless proximity sensor to turn on the timer, and would be expensive in terms of construction and electronics. The better question is why make one when grenades are cheaper and more devastating and don't require weeks-months of training to master. Honestly a C4 frisbee might work better for distance, and a drone is going to work better for distance and angle of attack. 

Purple is not really a color in the way we think of it, it is an artifact of how our eyes are put together, primates are probably the only organisms that see purple. As Renan pointed out it is created by activating red cones and blue cones without activating green cones, which actually requires two separate wavelengths at the same time, thus the best way to produce it consistently is have two strong color sources. Red Rocks and Blue Plants An early oxygen atmosphere (that is to say an atmosphere that has just recently risen in oxygen content) like the permian and triassic makes red rock and soils extremely common, see red beds. So make your plants and soil bacteria blue instead of green and you will end up with a lot pf purples on land but really blue seas. red rocks and blue rocks Alternatively in the same type of atmosphere as above soils that a very rich in both iron and copper would give a variety of purple colors. The hard part is having enough copper, iron is fairly common but copper is not, especially on a galactic sense. 

Strength, hardness, and atomic pattern. A cutting edge is basically just a thin as possible section of material to spread the forces of contact pressure out over as small an area as possible the maximizing the pressure on the material being cut. To withstand this the edge material needs to be strong (in terms of both yield strength and ultimate strength) enough to not crack or bend when made thin. It needs to be hard (in the mohr sense) to maintain an edge otherwise the edge will just wear away. The size and purpose of the blade can change the balance between the two. small scalpel blade favor hard over strong, since it is too small to experience much bending, while a sword would need to be stronger and would have to sacrifice hardness to achieve it. g=Generally you want your edge as hard as possible but making it too hard often costs strength, this can be fine in a single use blade but completely counterproductive in anything that will see a lot of usage. Generally you do not want your blade made of anything crystalline, an amorphous atomic pattern is ideal for making the sharpest edge, basically glasses, even steel knives try to keep the metal crystals as small as possible to get as close to a metallic glass as they can. Silica glass can make a much sharper edge than steel but is brittle so it only works if small and wears out quickly. Diamond for instance is very hard but also very brittle making it useless for anything but the smallest of blades. It also has a regular crystal pattern limiting the geometry of the blade you can make so you cannot make it as sharp as a steel or glass blade. There is a physics stack that explains the physics in more detail, and here is a paper on the subject. 

lethal compressed gas rifles do exist, so you would see more improvement and investment in them. so most hunting would continue. Not good for handguns though and not strong enough for the largest game, so not much bear hunting. for the military you would see a restructuring around melee combat and probably a resurgence of platemail. if bombs still work we would see a lot more use of grenades in combat. 

No becasue the spectrum of light coming into the room is uncontrolled and from multiple sources, and the light is passing through all the material between it and the source. You would just see a muddy mix of all the materials between the various light sources and the visor, Then you add it reflection and refraction. All that overlap washes out and spectral lines.Light is just a bad way to detect smell. batman is just better off using a electronic nose and letting normal diffusion bring the sample to you. Or he can used targeted fluorescent antigen like sprays as Jason was mentioning, police already do this. Here is a link about how smell works $URL$ 

Yes, you can find unique things but most things will be the same Since this is for a game, I am assuming by planet you mean something a human could actually walk around the surface of in a suit, so no gas giants or super cold ice balls. And I am restricting myself to planets and possibly moons, not everything in space, asteroids would be easier to min in many ways. Things every planet will have. metals, glass (made from silica), and rocks. Any planet even close to earth like gravity will have lots of these. It is what they are made of. they might find more of some materials but they will not find much in the way of different materials, the laws of physics are still the same. Something however might be much easier to find on some, some planets might be rich in rare earth elements and they find unique minerals produced with them. There minerals on earth with interesting properties that only exist in a single place on earth, caused by a unique combination of conditions. So it is possible they might find a planet with lots of naturally occuring superconductors or something like that. Yes they could find something humans had never thought of but such thing will occur on planets with very un-earth like conditions and be rare, how useful they will be is more or less random. things unique to earth (or planets with life). everything unique ot earth is a product of life. Plastics, wood, rubber, petroleum, etc are all products of life (or refined from products of life) so a fictional planet with life may have them or may not that is up to you and what you want the life on the planet to produce. A planet without life should not have them with the possible exception of petroleum, there are some very rare circumstances, like some moons, which produce hydrocarbons seas, and that only gives you petroleum. On the other hand planets with different life might well have completely different things produced by their life, wood might be unique to earth, milk and feathers will almost certainly be. Some planets might have life with iron teeth barbon fiber shells, or chitin trees. The vast majority of unique materials you find will be products of local life forms. I remember reading a story as a kid about an organism heavily poached in a galactic civilization becasue it produced a liquid that stayed a liquid even under hard vacuum and was used as spaceship lubricant. so it really comes down to what you want to build your houses out of and what you use to fuel your starships. A wooden house will not be possible on a planet devoid of life, but a house on such a planet does not make a lot of sense either. Plastic is only going to come from a planet with a manufacturing factory to produce it. Water will be your rarest resource, although some planets will be absolutely packed with it either as water or more likely as ice. As L.Dutch said there is a big difference between raw and manufactured materials that needs to be considered. 

biologists and geologists mostly, of a variety of subdisciplines but no one too specialized at the same time, you want people who know how to take samples correctly and how to assess comparative value of samples, and can work with may aspects of the field equally well. Like Nasa missions there will be a lot of cross training, you are never just an expert in one field. The more expertise you can pack in each brain the better. That said overspecialization makes you useless. This is especially true for biologists since right now we only have earth life to study. Your scientists need a broad base. A botanist for instance would be less useful than a general biologist (of equal quality) since whatever is fulfilling the plant like niches is unrelated to earth plants and thus will not mesh well with the assumptions a specialist is used to working with. Likewise a geneticist will be useless if the life there does not use nucleic acids, but would be very helpful if it does, so you should decide if they go in with any information. This is also affected by how much room you have, and if you know anything about the planet before you go, if you already know it has life for instance biologists become a lot more important and you will want many of them. Exo-geologists have to understand a lot about many different aspects of geology since many of the familiar rules of geology change on different planets. So you want at least one geochemist, and one exo-geologist at bare minimum. geology is less troubled by specialization since, for instance, volcanoes are volcanoes no matter which planet they are on, so if you have space for a volcanologist bring one. biochemists, these are the people who will be doing the initial analysis of many samples so you you are going for an extended visit you want some along. for short visit they are less necessary, although would be a helpful bonus if there is space, and a must have for cross-training. Paleontologists,mostly as cross training, that gives them an advantage with dealing with unexpected ecosystems, and you really want someone looking for fossils. A Planetary climatologist although for the most part they can work remotely provided you have decent satellites, but if you have room or are staying for a while definitely bring one, they will end up working with the geologists a lot. Even for a shorter visit you definitely want some cross training for this to take some ice cores if possible. If the planet has oceans, a oceanologist would be a must have, with the same specialization caveat as the biologists. A medical expert will be important not just for normal mission needs but also for understanding how the world affects your explorers, this is especially important for longer missions. Ideally you want to release a lot of satellites and remote drones/propes so you cover a lot of land. Even more ideally you want satellite map before you even plan on landing, so you know where the most interesting looking things are. No expedition would be sent to a planet that had not been heavily observed by remote/satellite means or without a map of at least the majority of the planet's surface. Note I am assuming we are talking about people on the landing mission, there may well be other scientists in a orbital ship, ones who are not concerned with the planets surface, of who can work better remotely.
