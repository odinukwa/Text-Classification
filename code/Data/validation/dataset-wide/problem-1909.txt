I'm not a coder, but I'm a sales person (I've heard "no" more times than you ever will) and I'm also a supervisor (I'm tasked with motivating others), so I will give you my advice on general ways to improve your next review and keeping motivated. First, both you and your boss identified an area that needs improvement. So, do your best to improve and learn. Can you take courses? Make a conscious effort to fix just one of the mistakes or errors you do on a consistent basis and soon you will stop making that mistake. Repeat as needed. Second, while time is of the essence it typically takes less time (in any task) to do it correctly the first time than it does to fo back to correct mistakes. Do it right the first time and you may just find that you have more time to complete future tasks. Motivation can, and should, be internal in addition to external factors. What drove you to this line of work? What inspires you to stick with it? Keep those things in mind. As for your self doubt, remember that this company hired you and keeps you for a reason. If you continue to improve yourself, without being asked, they will have little reason to sever the relationship. 

Why argue with this situation, unless the time punch system is cumbersome or unreliable. I'm salaried and have to fill in a time sheet every week. For HR purposes it is sometimes necessary to have all employees track hours. Also, some types of exempt employees are required to work 40 hours per defined work week but aren't given overtime for days they work +8 hours. Even high level executives are required to submit time sheets or record hours within my organization. Just clock in and out and stop complaining. Honestly, it makes you less desirable as an employee to protest against such a simple request. 

Without sounding too harsh, your use of language is awkward. I can deconstruct your writing style sentence by sentence. 

You might be constructing sentences in your head in your native language (I would guess Chinese?) and then translating that into English. Because sentences are formed differently in English than in Chinese, for example, it is difficult for others to follow. It is only difficult because you are communicating in a way different from what they are used to. The remedy for this is to expose yourself to regular, common use of the English language. Read. Read for long periods, (1-2 hours a day). You can read fiction or non-fiction (Harry Potter, Malcolm Gladwell books, it doesn't matter, as long as they're clearly written works*). By reading, you will learn absorb what good writing is, by observing it and seeing it in practice. Also, try watching English TV shows, and pay attention to how you talk, and how it differs from how people use language on TV. *e.g. Don't go and read Shakespeare! 

If they involve you in the pranks, just tell them you don't like pranks and they annoy you. If they don't stop annoying you, complain. There is no way to have a bunch of pranksters both consider you in the group while you do not participate in the activities of their social group. Deciding to be an "outlier" is something done by how you act. So you can't have it both ways. I completely understand your desire not to be annoyed! Don't be in such need of acceptance that you're willing to endure pain or bullying for it. If they act inappropriately, take the necessary steps to shut it down. 

As a sales person and someone who also interviews prospective sales people, I have an idea of their motivation for this question. They are looking for YOUR motivation to sell their products. Do you have a passion for the product line or services? Or, are you just looking to make some money? First, I would ask a question. What are the commission structures for both positions? This shows you know what sales is about, making money. No matter their response to your question, your answer should be about how you can help them and want to learn from them. You can also ask which product is their 'bread and butter' or 'up and comer' or which they feel is going to lead them into the next phase of company growth. Always respond with positive comments on both products, no matter which position gives you more financial gain or you have more interest in. If you are really green and know diddly squat about sales, the products or the industry, always (and I mean always) express interest in learning about all sides of the industry, the company and what they are selling and how you can help them. If I were interviewing I would also ask if moving between the departments at some point would be an option. I'm a stead fast believer that one must know everything they can about the business they are in to be able to sell it better. 

Should be: "People have told me that I can communicate what I want to say, but it is not simple and clear" 

Here's my opinion. You should not miss the opportunity to have great in-game art. You should try to harness this person's capabilities as best you can. At the same time, what Sean is saying, is toxicity is unacceptable and can kill your team. If he demotivates the other artists and prevents the game from getting finished, that's not too good. So there are a few ways you can handle this. 1) One is, make him aware that his comments are hurtful. Explain to him that he needs to be tactful in commenting on other people's work. You'll never reach your goal if your team is continually sabotaging itself. 2) If you can modularize the work, and act as the middle man, then you can kind of reduce reason for Mr. Direct to put other people down. 

Just ask to meet/see the team you'll be working with. The entire team. Say you're interviewing with 3 people and the time for "questions" comes. At that time say "I'd like to meet the team." What will probably happen is they'll take you over to the area where your to-be-teammates are. If you don't see any other women on the team, then simply don't join. You, as the job hunter, are responsible for investigating the environment you are placing yourself in. Sometimes, it is better to ask a question, or request to see something, which will indirectly get the response to a question in your mind, without asking that question explicitly, or having the recruiters ever even know that (working with a woman) was a concern of yours.
