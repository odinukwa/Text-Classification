It is unlikely anything other than salt would be derived from sea water. The largest deposit of gold is dissolved within the worlds oceans - in terms of tonnes of metal. The problem with extracting the gold from sea water is the concentration is so low it is uneconomic to do so. It's why we keep mining hard rock sources of most metals. This problem exists for other metals dissolved in the worlds oceans. We are only just starting to mine minerals from the sea floor - see Nautilus Minerals operations off the coast of Papua New Guinea. In terms of Moon colonists requiring minerals from Earth, various salts or carbonates might be candidates. IF the colonists will be making steel, as opposed to just making iron, on the Moon they would need carbon, which would have to be sourced from Earth. Allied with the extremely low concentration of metals in sea water, the concentration of minerals/metals in some deposits on the Moon may be very low and it might be cheaper and/or easier to obtain the minerals/metals from Earth. The other problem that might arise is that the mineral assemblages on the Moon may be different to that on Earth and while mining the minerals might be straight forward extracting the required/useful metals via metallurgical processes may be so problematic, or energy intensive, that it is easier & cheaper to obtain some minerals/metals from Earth. Unlike on Earth, water in large quantities will not be able to be used for metallurgical processes, such as froth flotation. Similarly, processes requiring the use of large quantities of oxygen will not be able to be used. New metallurgical processes may need to be developed to exploit lunar minerals. The problem for Moon colonists may not be the lack of minerals, but the lack of other types of resources to assist with metallurgical recovery or they may not be able to have metallurgical processes to exploit minerals on the Moon. 

Have you tried the meteorological service in the US? My experience is most major weather stations record temperature and pressure at half hourly intervals 24/7. From these recordings daily maximum and minimum temperatures are then made available to the news services. 

Dew point gives an indication of the moisture content of air; it is the temperature at which air can no longer hold water vapour. The following graph shows the relations of dew point to air temperature (dry bulb) for various levels of humidity. 

As for carbon dioxide, it is fairly well mixed in the atmosphere, particularly at altitude. Concentrations of carbon dioxide vary laterally near the Earth's surface, with the concentrated regions occurring in areas of major human activity, as can be seen from the NASA produced picture below. 

Regarding linking population density with cases of melanoma, that causal link occurs with all diseases. Cases don't occur where people don't live, they occur where people do live. Consequently, the likelihood of cases occurring increases with population density. UV C radiation is blocked by nitrogen in the upper atmosphere. Upper atmospheric ozone acts as a barrier to UV radiation by absorbing most of the UV B radiation and whereas UV A radiation is not blocked by the atmosphere. Near surface ozone will not do anything to protect against UV radiation. Ozone is very reactive and is a powerful oxidizing agent and can damage skin. Prolonged exposure to lower levels of UV radiation (low UV index) can be more damaging than short exposure to high UV index radiation. UV index is a poor guide to the likelihood of developing melanoma, or any other form of skin cancer. Duration of exposure is very critical. When it's hot people to tend to stay out of the sun, which also reduces their exposure to UV radiation. When it's cooler, people tend to stay out in the sunshine, increasing their exposure to UV radiation. 

Edit: After the question was edited to clarify the tungsten spike would move by gravity alone. Nothing much will happen. Such a spike, regardless of it mass, will sink into soil or sand, but once it contacts denser material, such as rock, and unavoidable lateral earth pressures also squeeze on the spike, movement of the spike will stop and it will still be near the surface of the Earth. Gravity alone will not provide such a spike with the energy it needs to split rock. 

From a list & map of known seamounts and submarine volcanoes it is unlikely the orange region in your picture is a submarine volcano. The average depth of the Pacific Ocean is 4280 m. At such a depth, a submarine volcanic eruption would not produce such a large area of illumination. It is more likely that the orange region in your picture is sunglint, which is, 

Every second, $\small\sf{7000\ L}$ of water flows from River 1 into River 3. Similarly, $\small\sf{11\ m^3}$ of water flows from River 2 into River 3. The combined inflow into River 3 is $\small\sf{18\ m^3}$ every second. Assuming the density of water in both inflowing rivers is the same, volume of water can be used instead of mass; if not then the density of water for each river needs to be used. Assuming the water density of both rivers is the same, convert all to units SI units and the average concentration of Mg in River 3 is, $\sf{\dfrac{7(0.5) + 11(0.34)}{(7 + 11)}}$ = $\sf{0.402\ g/L\ Mg}$ I'll let you do the calculation for Ca. 

Whereas, Enceladus and Triton experience cryovolcanism, where ice and water are ejected under pressure. 

The same problem applies to all shapes that are complex and this includes coastlines, rivers and the perimeters of leaves. Most shapes derived by nature will have this issue. The unit of scale matters. Only shapes that are composed of straight line segments and can be easily measured as such do not have this problem: triangles, rectangles, hexagons, etc. Such shapes are mathematical or created by humans. 

Potentially, a landslide could occur. Whether it would be a minor slip or a major fall depends on the geological conditions at the site, the force of the water and the duration that the site is impacted by the water. In the video in question, the rock face above the road appears competent, but there are not guarantees. The main issue would be is the water undermining the road which could cause a slip and the road to slide. The more loose the geological material is, the easier it is to dislodge it. Once one item moves a chain of events can occur where additional items are dislodged and a slide occurs. In addition to high pressure water dislodging material, water acts as a lubricant, making it easier for rocks and regolith to be dislodged. To minimise the potential for a slide to occur in such a situation, the surface of the road would need to be sealed very well and a very good drainage system installed that would move the water away from the road and the slope below the road 

If you're in the open air you will be exposed to the full concentration of the pollutants in the air. By being inside, there's a reasonable assumption that the rate of interchange of air between inside a house and outside will be low and that inside there will be a lower concentration of pollutants. Houses and buildings are not hermetically sealed. The gaps around windows and doors are small which results in low rate of airflow between the outside and inside of the houses and buildings. The less windy the weather the lower the flow rates. The other way to consider it is when a room has been closed for a lengthy period while someone has been in the room, the air in the room becomes stuffy. This is because the air in the room is not being replaced by fresh air quickly enough to remove stuffy air. To remove to stuffy air the windows and doors need to be left open for a period of time for fresh air to replace the stuffy air. The same thing happens when the air outside is heavily polluted. The air inside is cleaner and remains cleaner for a longer period if the doors and windows remain shut because the rate of transfer between air inside the building and outside is small. 

The presence of water underground has nothing to do with sea level in mountainous country. When rain fails on a mountain, or snow falls on a mountain and the snow eventually melts, the water from the rain or snow melt mostly travels downhill via rivers to the sea. In getting to a river some of the water will fall on the ground. In places where the ground is covered by soil, water can travel through the soil via the pore spaces between the grains of soil. Similarly if porous rock, such as sandstone lies beneath the soil water can travel through the pores in the rock. If a layer of impervious rock lies under the porous rock or soil, the water cannot move downwards, due to gravity, any further. This can lead to water accumulating in the soil or porous rock and saturating the soil or rock. In such situations an aquifer can form. The top of the saturated zone in an aquifer is called a water table. The ground beneath a river is saturated and the surface of the river shows the water table exposed to atmosphere. Thus in mountainous regions the ground beneath rivers will be saturated and capable of supporting a well developed from the bank of a river.
