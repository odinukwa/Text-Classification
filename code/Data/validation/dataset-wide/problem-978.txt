Given that it's a quarry then at a guess the grass is growing over areas that are cut into the bedrock more deeply than the non-grassed areas, this means that there is a trench that holds a little more soil and water than the relatively bare rock outside of the cuts like a cropmark but smaller and more extreme. 

I know in New Zealand we have a number of soils you can't raise dairy herds on because the nitrate in their urine strips too many nutrients too fast, to the point where one can tell where the cow urinated a couple of weeks ago because that patch of grass is dying from several different deficiencies simultaneously. My understanding is that dairy cows are, hands-down, the worst farm animal for this because they stand still when voiding and dump up to 15 litres of moderate-high nitrate liquid waste at a time which all goes effective straight down through the soil column robbing it of nutrients along the way. On the other hand there are also some soils, generally in more arid areas, where nitrate doesn't migrate right through the soil column at all but concentrates in the subsoil as a visible, white, salty, horizon. As a rule the more water retentive the soil the longer water soluble compounds like nitrate will take to work down into the ground at a given water input. There are also some chemical interactions that will bind nitrate and slow it down more than you might expect we need study them in my soil fertility papers but I can't think what they are right now. But to answer your question, usually soluble soil ions (which nitrate is) move on a timescale of days, weeks or maybe months, but not decades. We wouldn't need to apply slow-release nitrate fertilisers annually if it didn't migrate through at least the top-soil relatively rapidly. 

It's reporting bias, and over longer time spans there's a preservation bias as well since a small eruption like Ruapehu 1995-96 will not show up in the fossil record at all after a few hundred years of erosion. These days we watch the world from far more angles with far greater scrutiny than at any stage in the past so we see eruptions that we would never have paid attention to in the past that's all. That's why there are pronounced dips in the graph during the World Wars, volcanoes didn't stop but people were elsewhere with other things on their minds. 

Not one that I can immediately see, in order to derive a per cubic metre figure (m^-3) you need to know how many cubes of soil you have in a given column unit, that requires the depth of the unit in question. 

These are identifiers that can indicate advance or retreat, either current or historic, but at a glance there are no definitive signs of any long-term trend in the glaciers' behaviour. This is chiefly because glaciers advance and retreat on a seasonal basis so a particular feature may be the product of one winter of heavy snow (some years ago) or one very hot summer. 

I can make arguments for half a dozen or more things but the most likely are Agate and Calcite, try a drop of dilute vinegar on the surface, if bubbles form then you have a Calcite, or at least a reactive Carbonate Mineral, if it doesn't react then the most likely answer is Agate or another amorphous Silicate. I say these are the most likely purely on the basis of the commonality of those minerals generally it could be something really odd but I don't enough about the specific mineralogy of South Wales to start on those possibilities. 

There are two "normal" mechanisms for this effect: Clay bonding, the beach sand contains a small fraction of clay particles which bond to the grain surfaces and hold the sand together when dry, this is normally the mechanism where the beach is backed by mudstone cliffs or quite close to river mouths supplying fine sediment to the beach. Evaporite Cementation this is the more widespread and common process then what you are seeing is a small scale, and often abortive/short-lived formation of "Beachrock" this is the most likely explanation and the cause will probably be a rainwater/seawater interaction on the surface of the beach where it is still wet with seawater but no longer wave-washed as the tide recedes. 

As a rule no, while sulfur and nitrogen compounds from industrial and vehicle exhaust have an immediate impact and a relatively fast deposition cycle and thus are extremely location sensitive carbon dioxide is relatively long lived in the atmosphere and too plentiful in discharge to be heavily effected by the environment of discharge, assuming direct atmospheric discharge. If you pumped carbon dioxide discharge into water instead of the air then the atmospheric concentrations would be greatly effected by location, specifically temperature and algal uptake rates. 

Best guess based on texture more than anything else is Chert, we have a lot of honey coloured chert in my neck of the woods but I'm not sure if it's as common in the north hemisphere. 

Given the preponderance of young volcanic rocks in your part of the world I'd be inclined to go with Ignimbrite as my first guess. The picture you have supplied looks almost identical to samples I have at home of welded ignimbrites from the Taupo Volcanic Zone. The black inclusions are likely to be Pyroxene phenocryst in a groundmass of what was at one point white hot volcanic ash. 

1 part per billion is 1x10^-9 kilograms per kilogram so to convert a kilogram per kilogram ratio into a parts per billion figure divide it by 1x10^-9. 

Okay have a look at this article it may be some use, it's the Journal of GeoEngineering, Vol. 8, No. 1 April 2013 Pgs 27-32 so you may be able to get a hard copy if the link fails, it talks about clay core dams and seepage calculations thereof, including phreatic pathway estimation. If I remember correctly rock fill in earth dams is treated as earth for the purposes of working out seepage lines etc... as it is generally small enough (particle size), relative to the dam as a whole, to have little or no effect on total mean permeability. 

Looks like a chunk of quartz. Please re-write the question following A guide for asking "Identify this rock" questions? . 

21.7%, by my calculations (338 / 1556 holocene-active volcanoes). I calculated perennial snow by combining 6 weeks of MOD10A2 data from winter and summer weeks in 2014 to figure out which pixels had snow both in the summer and the winter. My source code for that is available as a gist (an older version accidentally classified cloud as snow; that's been fixed). Then I checked if these pixels fell within 10km of the volcanoes in the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Database. I also plotted the woefully incomplete Global Land Ice Measurements from Space glacier polygons. There are clearly a few false-positives on ocean islands... I think this is due to MOD10A2 marking choppy surf as snow. Looking into that. I intend to publish this and will put a reference here if it is published. Here's what the map looks like for part of Alaska: 

Looks like a shell from a bivalve of some kind, that has been worn presumably by wave action. You may want to update your question with more context. Where did you find it? Also, your photos are all out of focus and some are overexposed, so you may want to re-take the photos. You might also want to try asking on a biology or zoology site. 

On p. 6 of this article: Bliss, A.K., Cuffey, K.M., Kavanaugh, J.L., 2011. Sublimation and surface energy budget of Taylor Glacier, Antarctica. Journal of Glaciology 57, 684â€“696. There is an expression for sublimation rate as a function of latent heat flux $L$ and (specific) latent heat of sublimation (of water ice) $\lambda$. 

Because of the Coriolis Effect, the prevailing winds on the earth between about the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer go from the East to the West (knows as the Trade Winds). To get to the west coast of a continent within those latitudes, an air mass blowing from above an ocean must cross the entire continent. Along the way, the air mass causes precipitation (rain, snow, etc.) and loses water so by the time it reaches the west coast the air tends to be very dry and average annual precipitation will be very low. "Rain shadow" is a related effect in which the lee side of mountain ranges are dry because air masses experience orographic rainfall when they encounter the mountain range. This causes the Atacama desert to the west of the Andes, and the Mojave to the east of the Sierra Nevada. Note that the Mojave is east of the Sierra Nevada rather than west because the prevailing wind direction is westerly (from west to east) because it is north of Capricorn. Bear in mind that this explanation is extremely approximate and oversimplified, and that your assumption of deserts on the western side of a continent should be reversed north of about Capricorn and South of about Cancer, where the Trade Winds are replaced by the Westerlies. 

The previous answers contain important facts, but neglect recent discoveries. As tobias47n9e says, the increase in observed output over time is an observational effect. As kaberett explains, if you're talking about megayear timescales, Large Igneous Provinces will have a large impact on the timeseries. However, LIP and all continental eruptions (~1km^3 / year) are dwarfed by midocean ridge seafloor eruptions (~3km^3 / year). Volcanologists have made major progress towards answering your question (are production rates trending? periodic?) over the last few years. We've learned that: 

Together, these two claims seem to imply that if it's not thicker than 30m, it's not a glacier. Are either of these claims correct, and do they indeed imply my conclusion? N.B. The question arises because I've been working with some literature and databases that refer to things less than 30m thick as glaciers. Update: looking closer at GlaThiDa, I notice that it contains 490 glaciers listed with mean_depth less than 5m. However, all of these are from a single article (Cogley, 2008) and some of them are apparently only centimeters thick. Something must be wrong with this data; I'm looking into it. 

Absolutely. Lithospheric flexure due to volcanic edifice emplacement is well-documented. Not only do you get isostatic depression near the volcano, but further afield you actually can have uplift due to a "hinging" sort of effect. Lithospheric flexure drives the growth of underwater coral atolls through subsidence at a recently emplaced volcano (coral forms at a fixed depth beneath sea level), but later can lift the same coral above sea level due to far-field volcanic emplacement, turning the underwater atoll into an island. See the seminal work on this by McNutt & Menard (1978). 

Neither displacement nor acceleration; most seismometers measure velocity. If you want displacement, you integrate the output over time, and if you want acceleration, you differentiate the output over time. Check the datasheet for the instrument you are interested in. For example, the Guralp 3T datasheet says that it outputs 1500V m/s, so for each meter per second of ground velocity the output increases by 1500V. (It also says it only outputs from +20V to -20V, so this means ground velocities greater than 20/1500 = 0.013 m/s will be "off the chart" i.e. saturate the instrument). Actually, the voltage output from a seismometer is not exactly proportional to displacement, velocity, OR acceleration. The actual output is the input displacement convolved with the impulse response of the seismometer. It's just that the impulse response is designed such that it will have an approximately linear response to ground velocity within the corner frequencies. In the 3T datasheet we were looking at, they say it's within -3 dB of linear as long as it's measuring ground that's not oscillating faster than 50Hz or slower than 0.0083Hz for one version of the instrument. Measuring displacement directly is known as geodesy (as opposed to seismometry) and the tools used for those measurements include GPS, lidar, and radar. To measure acceleration (strong motion), as Jay says, you can use an accelerometer. Or, precariously balanced rocks for the palaeo case!
