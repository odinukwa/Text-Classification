Fall More. If you're not falling a lot, then you're not pushing yourself enough, ergo you won't see much improvement. Grasping a basic understanding of proper climbing technique is what enables most new climbers to quickly advance in their climbing abilities, but once you have that understanding of climbing principles, then your limitations are mostly physical; you need stronger fingers and core. If you're topping out at V2, then chances are you're still not very fond of holding onto anything that you can't fit all four pads on and sink up to your second knuckle, you need to get familiar with hanging onto holds that you think are just terrible, namely: small crimps, pinches, and slippery slopers. Most new climbers hate these types of holds, but that's because it takes training and experience in order to know how to approach them, how to hold them without injuring yourself, and what angle you need to hang onto them without popping off, this is where core strength is key, you need a strong core to keep you balance and hold everything together. Although this is question is rather broad, the general answer would be to spend more time at the climbing gym in the bouldering cave. You can climb a lot harder in the gym than you can outside, because it's a much more controlled environment, and you don't have to worry as much about hurting yourself when you fall. When I went outdoors I was more interested in toping out than I was projecting something hard, and spent more time finishing problems. If I couldn't get it in a few tries, I'd move on, but in the gym I'd project the same problem for months and some I'd only ever top out on once. Some I'd be able to piece together, but never be able to get all the way through them, and they'd eventually get taken down when the holds were cleaned and the cave re-set. If you want to see quick improvement, you need to be constantly challenging yourself, and trying problems that are way above your grade, dedicated boulderers will spend absurd amounts of time trying to master a single move in a problem, they will train like crazy, with that one single move in mind. Case and point: anyone who has ever tried to climb "Lucid Dreaming" out in Bishop California, it only has two or three moves, but it's a V15 (downgraded from a V16, but the topout is "only" a V7). 

That's essentially how 4 season tents work, the tent is full nylon (no mesh) and the fly is full and basically acts as a second tent, creating that air gap. some 4 season tents even have little foamies on them that help keep the gap, preventing snow from squishing the fly against the tent and eliminating that insulating volume: 

One technique I found that worked was to get low and lead with my feet. When a gust came along, instead of pushing into the wind, I'd try to duck under the gust and reach forward with me feet. All the while I was trying to keep my ax plunged into the snow behind me, which wasn't easy for moving because I had my shorter waterfall ice tools and they were plunging up to my wrist. I essentially had to keep one hand on the ground and almost semi-crawl down the mountain feet first. 

As far as tents go, I think it's largely up to them, I know a lot of old school campers who still prefer their beastie canvas A-frame tents because it's what they are familiar with and what they're comfortable setting up. So unless you're the one who is going to set the tent up for them, maybe hold off on getting them a new tent until they decide they want to upgrade (after going out once or twice with you and seeing how nice your tent is for example). 

I would use a dyneema rope as a lightweight hauling rope, rap line, or rescue rope, but I would never use any kind of static rope to catch a fall, this would include a fall into a crevasse, or a slip on a slope. With static ropes there is nearly zero energy absorption, I imagine this is even more true with dyneema. In the event of a fall during glacier travel, the immediate response for the rest of the team is to fall onto their ice axes in self arrest (team arrest). 

I'm literally in the thick of the smoke right now, fires are burning a half hour upwind of me, and ash has been falling from the sky like snow. Just this past couple weeks the government has been shutting down the backcountry to all access. The nearby National Park just issued a voluntary evacuation order, and they're talking about upping it to a mandatory evacuation. I have friends and family who have already been evacuated from their homes in BC because fires are burning out of control. Hiking in the backcountry is simply not advisable at this time. But depending where you are, you may be far enough down wind and safe from the fire. I went on several hikes this summer with a haze of smoke in the air, but not enough to warrant the use of a mask. If you're in smoke thick enough to need a mask, then chances are you're too close to the fire and probably shouldn't be putting yourself at risk of getting trapped out in the backcountry. You're only going to complicate the efforts of emergency response crews if you do. Be sure that you know where the fire danger is before you go out on your hike, and do not put yourself in the path of of anything. If you are far enough removed from the fire that it won't present any danger, then the best thing to take along with you would be a pollution mask, which are purpose built for being worn outdoors in poor air quality while being moderately active (walking around/cycling/commuting etc.). There is a selection of rather stylish masks available on Amazon. Cambridge Mask Co. 

HI-TEC You may or may not have seen the viral video that circulated a few years ago about Hi-Tec's water repellent shoes. If not, then you have to watch it: Liquid Mountaineering. $URL$ 

I actually had to research backyard beehives not long ago because our Peace Officer discovered someone in town who had hive on their property, and our land use bylaw didn't allow it. I found out that a lot of people in cities keep bees, your neighbour could have a hive and you might not even know it. Odds are most bees in your backyard are domesticated if you live in an urban area. Most wild hives discovered near populated areas are typically collected by beekeepers anyway, and they add them to their hive. Whenever we get a call about a bee infestation, we have a wait list of of beekeepers we can call who are more than eager to come and collect them. The only difference between wild honey bees and domesticated honey bees is where their hive is, and whether or not humans are taking a cut of their honey. Bees aren't exactly loyal to their queens, it's common for beekeepers to collect swarms and add them to their hives, or give them a queen and make a new hive. Re-queening is even a thing. If a hive is acting aggressive, the beekeepers will "dethrone" the sitting queen and give the hive a new one. Good luck trying to follow a bee to its hive though. They fly in straight lines above roof tops to and from where they're gathering pollen, and they don't doddle when returning to the hive. Finding a bee hive is not exciting anyway. They're quite boring actually, just a bunch of plain square boxes with bees coming in and out when they're busy. There are a lot of farms around where I live, so you see boxes of bees on the side of the highway all over the place. Farmers will hire bee keepers to put bees on their property so they can help pollenate their crops. A tree full of blossoms and just buzzing with activity is more interesting than a domestic beehive. In the city people paint their beehives the same colour as their fence to make them inconspicuous. This is about as exciting as they get: 

Alcohol is poisonous, it saturates your blood with sugars and will dehydrate you faster as your body sucks your own cells dry in need of water to dilute those sugars. If you're in a survival situation, and all that you have left is the heavy bottle of alcohol that you somehow forgot about and didn't notice weighing down your bag, the best thing to do with it would be to try and separate the water from the alcohol by distillation. This can be accomplished, but unless you're a chemist and have the appropriate instruments or mad MacGyvering skills, you'd be better off pouring the alcohol out onto the ground to avoid the temptation of drinking it. 

AT (Alpine Touring, aka-randonnee) is quickly rising to be the most popular form of downhill skiing. There are still those die-hard telemarkers that will never switch, and they will out distance you on the flats, but hands down AT is best for back country downhill. Buying skis is like buying shoes nowadays, what type you get depends a lot on what type of skiing you're going to do, if you're like me then you've got more than one pair of skis, one for all the different skiing conditions (or as many as your wife will let you get). The main differences in ski types are: Flex, Length, Waist size, Sidecut, Rocker, and Camber –– Mountain Equipment Coop has a good guide for choosing skis based on what type of a skier you are. –– If you're just getting into it, then look for an all-mountain ski, which will preform adequately in all terrain. Once you start specializing in a particular type of snow–deep backcountry pow for example–then you'll want to get a wider ski with a bigger shovel and more rocker. 

The type of knot you are looking for a called a friction hitch, or a slide and grip knot which is a kind of knot used to attach one rope to another in a way that is easily adjusted. There are many different ways to tie a friction hitch: 

I went ice climbing the other day at an exposed climb in gale force winds. This place is notorious for wind, and the gusts we were getting that day felt like they were up to the 80-90km gusts range. It was a full on Chinook. It wasn't bad when you were on the ice hanging on to your tools, but on the descent the wind was so intense I couldn't stay on my feet. It was gusting straight up the mountain, so I was fighting it the whole way down. The gusts would either stop me dead in my tracks or knock me over backwards. I dared not lean into the wind, because as soon as the gust died I would have fallen forward down the mountain. It was a struggle almost every step of the way. Getting blown around all over the place, I kept thinking to myself, how the heck are you supposed to deal with the wind in this kind of situation? 

Simply throwing them in the wash should suffice, but if you want to be extra sure the fungus dies, you could soak your socks in a 1 part bleach to 10 parts water mixture for ten minutes. Keep in mind that it's not your socks you need to worry about so much as your shoes, they're a little more difficult to clean. Try changing your insoles out, they make special ones which help prevent athletes foot. 

I climb barefoot and in vibram five-fingers (KSO's), climbed in them for the first time in 2008 and loved them, where they excel is in roofs and overhanging problems because you can hook holds a lot easier with your toes, but for tougher wall climbing with small features (5.11+) I still use climbing shoes. There are some gyms that allow climbing barefoot, but for the most part it's not allowed because of hygiene reasons-not many people want to touch toe grime on climbing holds, and feet just stink for the most part. Vibram five-fingers don't work very well for edging, so you have to change your footwork when you're climbing in them and think of your feet more as another pair of hands. The technique I use is to basically smear your foot on the front of the hold and use you toes to crimp on the top of it, you'll get some pretty bad cramps in the bottom of your feet while you're training them, so roll out on a tennis ball after. The only way you can really get purchase on small chips is to use the tip of your big toe while you point it, which takes the toe strength of an accomplished ballerino, so practice your en pointe poses. 

So this happened the other day; shouldn't have happened if I had been taking my time and paying attention to what I was doing, but it did: I was cleaning a bunch of ropes from the top of a short crag, there's trail access to the top of this crag, so after everyone was done climbing I climbed up one last time to clean all the anchors. On the last anchor, I cleaned the gear I was using, and quickly brought the one end of the rope up so I could feed it through the ring on the belay station anchor so I could rap down instead of hiking out. I was rushing a bit because everyone else had already walked off except one person, and truth be told I didn't have much on me at the time (long story short, I was climbing barefoot in a variation of one of these, and didn't bring a descender with me). So I feed the rope through the ring and drop the end back down, then quickly tie a munter and jump off the overhanging top. I got about a halfway down when I noticed that one of the ends of my rope wasn't touching the ground... In fact it was probably about 10-15ft above the ground. After rolling my eyes and chastising myself in my mind for being so careless, I had to decide what to do in order to prevent myself from running out of rope and taking a fall (I was free hanging and a good ways away from the wall). Obviously, I should have confirmed my rope was on the ground and knotted the ends, but what I should have done couldn't help me after it was too late. I know this is something that can happen when descending on two different sized ropes that are doubled up, because the smaller diameter rope will go through your device faster that the larger rope, and ergo come up short when you get to the bottom. Despite whatever circumstance may put you in this situation, what is the proper way to get out of it?
