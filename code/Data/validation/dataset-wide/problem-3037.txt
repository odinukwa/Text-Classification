The comparison between the soviet gulag system and US prison system would have to be made on % population confined. Iâ€™ve seen no numbers on that, nor did you provide numbers, other comparisons such as economic would fail to compare. I agree with Danny's answer, except about the economics. Economics had nothing to do with the ending of the Gulag system. Purely from an economic standpoint, the Gulags were pretty solid. Profit isn't the right word because gulags were run by the state, but as for economic benefits of the gulag systems for the state, they were well beyond significant. Right before the war, Gulags provided 46.5% of the nation's nickel, 76% of its tin, 40% of its cobalt, 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber. So Gulag's weren't merely a significant part of the Soviet Economy in the 30's, 40's and early 50's. They were the economy. The Soviet Union was dependent upon them for the materials which made the rest of the economy go. Why did they end? Lenin had started the Gulag system, and Stalin had expanded it. They ended mainly because Stalin died (March 1953) and the new Soviet Leader denounced him and his practices. Stalin was after all a larger mass murder than was Adolf Hitler and the Soviet Leadership which survived him knew it better than anybody else. The Gulag's ended as prisons for criminals in the early 50's. The release of political prisoners started in 1954 and became widespread after Nikita Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalinism in his Secret Speech at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in February 1956. It is true that some US states have a history of for profit prisons. But the prisoner's offenses, death rates, economic benefits of confinement, and overall national reliance on those piece meal institutions can't be compared with the discredited Soviet era death camps for mostly political prisoners. The Russian historian Golfo Alexopoulos said in 2017 that at least 6 million people died in the Soviet gulags which put's just Stalin's gulags on pare with Hitler's final solution.

Looks like Semaphore just beat me to it. I found it by googling who uses kanji characters. Then searching on cropped parts of the images (the portrait and bridge and kanji characters) , with "10" and interchanging country names like Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong and finally Taiwan. Took about 20 minutes. Found the 10 yen note from Taiwan currency circa 1960 with Dr Sun Yat-sen, born 1866 Xiangshan, Guangdong, from China, Portrait from 1925 Beijing. 

Johnson then goes on to champion that 1964 civil rights bill and in July of 1964 as President he signed the landmark legislation. Tying himself and his election to the fallen president and securing one of the largest landslide victories in the nations history. With Barry Goldwater only winning 6 states. His home state of Arizona; and the 5 deep south states of Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and South Carolina. Johnson went on after the 1964 Civil Rights Act, to pass the 1965 Voter's Rights Act. Together these two landmark Acts ushered in dramatic changes the country. 

Murder of London Police Officer Yvonne Fletcher at St. James Square London. April 17, 1984. At demonstration outside of the Libyan Embassy in London with about 75 protesters demonstrating against the government of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. Specifically protesting against Gaddafi's recent execution of two students in Libya. The London police had met the protesters at the embassy and had put up barriers to keep the protesters away from counter protesters. About 10:15 am, machine gun fire erupted from inside the embassy targeting the anti Gaddafi protesters, wounding 11 people including an unarmed London police officer on duty there to help manage the protesters. The officer was mortally wounded in the attack. Yvonne Fletcher who died at the scene. I remember at the time it was reported that a nephew of Gaddafi was in the embassy and was claimed to be the shooter. In 2015 the British picked up Dr Saleh Ibrahim Mabrouk, a former Libyan Education Minister and advisor to Gaddafi and charged him with the crime. The case was eventually dismissed when the British government reportedly declined to allow sensitive intelligence in the prosecution. 

A painting can be as useful or not useful as a photograph, a tapestry or even a written record; depending upon the knowledge, motivation and intent of the source. A painting is just another media used to tell the story, it has to be evaluated, studied and understood like any other piece of the puzzle in understanding the complete picture. As for this particular painting. It shows the battle being a mele. My sources refute that. My sources report the British were organized and showed well against a numerically superior (German had a 2-1 advantage in troops) enemy initially. This painting represents the aftermath of the battle. The battle was early in WWI, the British BEF fought well, but were significantly outnumbered. They ultimately were forced to withdraw when supporting troops guarding their flanks withdrew. British withdrawal started out orderly. The withdrawal however took two weeks and had the British retreating almost to the outskirts of Paris before counter attacking. So this picture represents what happened after the battle, when the retreat became disorganized. Only part of story. Maybe the most important part of the story for the British troops at the Battle of Mons. Sources: 1914 - Battle of Mons - history.com. Battle of Mons - Long Long Trail. Battle of Mons - wikipedia. 

In the late 1950's Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Baines Johnson was forming his first presidential campaign. He was advised his largest liabilities for national office was his vocal and consistent leadership in defense of segregation. This all but made him unelectable in the North and the West. In 1957 Johnson could not afford to alienate any of these regions. Johnson would try to finesse this liability. LBJ would outwardly support the 1957 civil rights bill, meanwhile he used his power as Senate Majority Leader to divert the bill into a committee controlled by a powerful southern committee Chairman. In the committee the 1957 bill would be neutered.
