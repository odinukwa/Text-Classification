You can but if it was ME, I wouldn't do it. The fork would cost more than the bike is worth. You may be able to find a used bike that accepts larger tires at the or near the same cost as a good quality fork. I ride with a bike shop mechanic that has a bike with 4.25 or 4.5 + size tires and it is surprisingly softer on bumps than most full suspension bike. I rode it and was amazed. You also, have the added benefit of not having to replace expensive suspension parts when they wear out 

Statistically speaking you are much more likely to die from skydiving. Or, since someone is going to say, "but we don't parachute", is that more likely to being hit by a skydiver belonging to an unopened parachute? All seriousness aside, there are several things that a person is more likely to die from than cycling no matter the road. But then the question is which roads are more dangerous than others and maybe should be avoided. I like Rider_X's statement that the decision is a personal assessment issue because it really is just that. Generally I can only speak for myself and like me, some cyclist are comfortable on any road, at almost any conditions. If your alert and always aware of what is going on behind you then the risk is minimized. But then I have been riding on roads of every type for for 38 years. We can call this type 'A'. However, other cyclist, especially ones new to cycling, are understandably cautious and nervous around motor vehicle traffic. Especially thicker traffic on busier roads at higher speeds. We can call this type 'B' Comfort does come with experience, confidence and mileage. But that doesn't mean that EVERY cyclist should bide on EVERY road at EVERY time. Since type 'A' feels very comfortable , he is less likely to make a dangerous mistake or do something unpredictable to confuse motorists and he feels perfectly calm and at ease. He is accustomed from almost 300,000 miles of bicycling to know where passing cars are from the sound of their tires hitting the pavement. He doesn't have to even look behind him or have a rear view mirror (Not advocating not having a rear view mirror) to know if motor vehicles are getting too close. Whereas, rider type 'B' does not have the same experience and confidence. Bottom line to this story is that even though I am comfortable on just about any road, there are still some roads and condition I try to avoid at certain times. My experience from tens of thousands of miles I have always found that the majority of motorist are alert enough to see and steer clear of slower moving vehicles. I used to say it was 97% and the other 3 percent had to not be paying attention just as they pass you and they may still miss you. But with today's handheld devices, motorist are more distracted than ever. Its not unheard of to see a motorist driving down a road with a device in from of their face while moving which is illegal in every state in the USA and probably every country I would imagine. All that being said, the motorist that i have the most problem with by far are the one that either don't think bicycles are allowed on the roads or should be on the roads or just upset that they have to deal with a bicyclist and try to come as close as they can to you on purpose as if to try and make a statement. Those are the ones you have to look out for the most. Even though they are paying attention, since they are trying to get close, they could get so close as to cause a critical mistake. Your particular Road That particular road does not look that long in the picture if your in the middle taking the photo. It does not have any shoulder to dive off on though and if there was another road nearby that was better, I would take it. Even if it takes you a half or even 1 mile out of the way. The average traveling time by bicycle to cover a mile id roughly 3 minutes give or take 30 second depending on if your faster or slower than average. My criteria is to assess as many things as possible aside from my own comfort level as: 

Not an all inclusive list by any means. One last notable thing - LIGHTS We have a retired guy in our club that rides with his lady friend on a tandem and they have about eight lights on their bike that they run at all times. With today's LED lighting you can have lights that are so bright they will make you stick out in the day time like a riding lawnmower going 70 mph on an interstate. My friends have been told by several motorist that they were almost blinded by their light in the day time. So you can always make yourself much more visible. 

I would like to think that a front suspension on a police bike is only there to cushion the jelly belly roll of our doughnut eating aficionados on bicycles while going off curbs. But on a less or more serious note, depending on your perspective I see here in our city that it is less functional than it is political. In Our City In our city in the USA (politics may work differently in your country or city) our 'mounted' police that ride police bikes do not do so on a daily basis. They are NOT bike police. They are regular cops that drive cruisers and during downtown special events, a couple of them get out the bikes to facilitate more approach-ability and ease of movement through crowds from one end of downtown to the other. Of course our city had just purchased a couple police Segways. So they normally get the Segways out as they use less energy and burn fewer doughnuts. But I have seen the police bikes at time strapped to a police SUV bike rack and being taken somewhere. Maybe it was to the repair shop who knows as they rarely use them to chase perpetrators through wooded areas and trails as they have dogs for that purpose. In our city we have few stairs and I couldn't imagine our officers taking them down stairs as they are no where near proficient or capable of navigating a bicycle around technical terrain as they only use them sparingly during special events. Our city police force of 130-200 (depending on year and budgetary constraints and layoffs) has a peddle pool of only about 10 units. How it normally works and why they are the bike they are In our city here, the city council approves a budget for every city expenditure. I have sat in many city council meetings and watched these approvals. They may approve $15,000usd for 10 bikes putting them in the $1,500 range. They approve the expenditure amount for purchasing new bikes usually to replace or purchase them all at the same time so that they are all the same type, year and model. They have an open bid time period where they may except open bids from local bike shops to other shops not local and online bike suppliers that may or may not have have specific 'Police bikes' for the purchase contract. They provide a very basic requirement list which usually has less to do with the way they may be used and more to do with equipment that needs to be mounted. The bike suppliers providing bids to this contract and rarely if ever provide any recommendations as to use or bike specifics and features. If a bike in the $1,500 range comes with a suspension fork, removing it and replacing it in terms of adding an additional fork (ie -$300 fork removed, +150 for non suspension fork, labor $50 = net savings $100 per bike) and labor would almost be a wash and not worth the time for them to consider. They accept a bid and contract is fulfilled and closed. Our city officials or police officers that use the bikes are not technically literate or knowledgeable enough to know what they want or need (though some cities in the world may have very capable and knowledgeable cyclist among their ranks) and unless they are directed by the contract bidders to an alternative, they will get a typical run of the mill police bicycle that is good and versatile for ALL terrain, obstacles and functions for all and every city. And that is the way it works. We normal or avid cyclist Now we, more normal, avid, every day cyclist may see a police bike as not specific enough to their needs and thus these bicycles, in many cities and in many terms, are not as specific as they could or maybe should be. Maybe a cross-bike with straight bars and a cross tire tread would be better suited for police work via bicycle. We, the ones that ride hundreds of miles a week on various types of bicycles are more averse at being able to determine bicycle use requirements in terms of bicycle type. But then we are not (in most cases) normally involved in budget approval, contract bidding and fulfillment. 

The Trek Domane SL 6 (50/34 & 11x32) however, suggest this combination of gearing is available on bicycles other than cross bikes but is aimed at a market of bicycle enthusiast that want a good quality bike and a large range of gearing as they may ride only once per weekend and could be 'out of condition' and not competitive and also offers less rigidity and more comfort for an all around versatile bicycle riding styles and roads. It come with a long cage derailleur which is no untypical these day as there are a number of these gearing combination offerings on production bicycles, just not as typical or common and the smaller number as the whole of retail bicycle sold. This gearing is also prevalent on Cross Bikes since they are designed for off and on road competition where they will typically be off road over trails, grass and weds going up steep trail climbs and across gravel and mud. In these competitions they throw in everything including the kitchen sink to bunny hop over and then you may be back on a road segment. This type of bike need to be very versatile with a gearing combination to match. The 'A' Typical gearing is more suited for road competitions like long road rides and criteriums where there are some fast sprints and maybe some rolling hills and climbs but no steep mountains with long fast descents as even a pro rider which can spin a faster cadence than the typical rider will spin the top gear out at around 69 km/h on a long fast decent. Their gear combinations are not always 'off the shelf' typical as some run a 52/36 crank and 11x32 cassette. The 'B' Typical is the average typical gearing for all around training and competition for the average competitive weekend warrior and racer for long stages. Most avid and competitive rider have no problem keeping 9-10 mph average up the steepest road climbs and the the 52 ring gives a good extra 4 km/h for long downhills. 

One thing to keep in mind after yo determine whether you have a cassette or freehub is to determine whether you have a uniglide, hyperglide or hyperglice C. That will dinnertime what compatible cassette you need. 

Thickness of traffic at the time of day I plan to use it. Will I be commuting while near dawn or dusk and how lighted is the road. Are there blind hills and curves Speed of traffic Type of driver predominately traveling this particular road Road condition including pavement style, evenness, age (cracks and pothole), existence of a shoulder, layout, design, Type of vehicles using it. How many larger vehicles like trucks aas compared to the number of cars. 

Rear hubs most of the time will accept anything from 7-9 speeds without modifying. In other words, any hub originally 7,8 or 9 speed should fit 7,8, or 9 speed. Regarding hub to cassette non-compatibility 10, 11 and now 12 speed cassettes are the ones that are not compatible. You will need a new shifter and 9 speed chain. 

Most avid cyclist even at below optimal conditioning can maintain 13 km/h up most road climbs. Any slower than 11 km/h and you out of the saddle quite often if not most of the time. You are not ever going to typically need a 36/32 gearing combination unless you weigh 280 lbs or more and /or extremely out of conditioning. 

Shimano Charts Remember that Shimano compatibility are based their expectation that you may be cross-chaining a drive-train as shown in the illustration below. Their charts ALWAYS allow a drive-chain to cross-chain as they do not know the experience of the rider that the bike is being sold to at the point of manufacture and design. 

On your CoMax, with a typical climbing cadence on a steep climb of about 87 would be going at 11.7 km/h These calculations are with 700x25c tire and wheel. Lets look at the differences: Current CoMax: 50/34 crank and 11x32 cassette, cadence 87 = 11.7 km/h You Custom Combo: 52/36 crank and 11x32 cassette, cadence 87 = 12.4 km/h Difference betwen the top two .7 km/h 'A' Typical: 50/34 crank and 11x28 cassette, cadence 87 = 13.4 km/h Jump between CoMax and the above setup 1.7 km/h 'B' Typical 52/36 crank and 11x28 cassette, cadence 87 = 14.2 km/h jump between CoMax and this setup 2.5 km/h The difference between your CoMax and the jump you suggested to be a prime increase for higher speeds on the road as compared to your speed up steep climbs on trails are only a difference of .6 km/h This is not a very considerable difference as traveling up a steep climb off road which is what a cross bike is deigned to be able to do, is a lot steeper of a climb than any typical climb that you will see on a road that motor vehicles are able to navigate. Reasons why your assumption may not be correct 

Hyperglide 'C' (on left) Non-Compact hub (on right) There are maybe a half dozen other things to consider and keep in mind that I can't recall specifically but I can point you to a great source of info wich is where I would refresh my memory at the links below. You may want to review my friend Sheldon's pages where he has a wealth of info on this and many subjects at: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

This illustration above shows proper shifting on a triple . You can imagine from this that even on a double crank that proper shifting would never be in a cross-chain situation. Derailleur-Cassette Compatibility That being said, I have fond that you can almost always increase 2-3 teeth on a low cassette gear. As Nathan said, you may be able to squeeze and 11-30 on with a b-screw adjustment to maximum. Being a 105 you may be able to get 11-32 as the lower derailleur models like Tiagra and Sora do not have as well designed parallelogram as the upper levels. For instance, the Sora line from 6-8 years ago had a problem doing more than 2 additional teeth comfortably but since models changed last year with the addition to 12 speed, Sora is now a redesigned Tiagra derailleur that in most situations could comfortably increase a cassette by 3 teeth. So not only the model of derailleur but also the years or age of it makes a difference as well. Derailleur hanger position/style to dropout position plays a roll and and sometimes 1-2mm can make all the difference in whether it works or doesn't. Capacity Solution As for capacity, you could solve some of this by eliminating the smallest front chainring or adjusting the front derailleur stops from allowing it to drop down to it. Triples have been deprecated for a reason and even with an older 8 or 9 speed, a double allows enough combination to get up the steepest of hills unless a person is very out of shape and in that case it would only take riding on flatter roads for 2-4 months to build up the strength. Pro racing setup did not have triples even for mountain stages and these triple cranks were primarily for touring setups where one would have panniers and cargo going through mountain passes. All of this information is not only taken from my own experience, but others and many quotes on the web to back up the notion that. You would do well to google Sheldon Brown as this guy has a knack for modifying and customizing bicycle equipment, namely drive-trains apart from the documented, working methods and standard and getting them to work smoothly. He has actually talked about this very subject and has many a plethora of online documentation and guides.
