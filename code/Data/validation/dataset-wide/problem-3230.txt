One hypothesis for their origins is the similarly elusive Homeric Pelasgian. The Philistines are said to have originated in Caphtor, which in turn has been theorised to be Cyprus or Crete. Incidentally, in Homer's epic Odyssey, the Greek protagonist Odysseus says that: 

The Second Council of Clermont met in the Basilica of Notre-Dame du Port, though at the time it wasn't a basilica yet. Most of the Council was spent dealing church matters inside the building, while laypeople congregated outside. Hence, when it was time to make his famous call to arms, Pope Urban II went out and addressed a large audience in an opening before the church. 

This is not new. Even in the 1860s Edward Freeman wrote in his influential (if tedious) magnus opus, the History of the Norman Conquest of England, that:: 

The practice went into sharp decline and went virtually extinct after the mid 1840s or so. The last recorded fatal duel seemed to have happened in 1852, between two Frenchmen. 

Because lances were unwieldy but required significant training to be proficient in. Their usefulness was progressively declining against the increasingly attractive (and cost-effective) firearms. 

The Peleset was one of the Sea Peoples to invade Egypt during the reign of Ramesse III in the fifth and eighth years. They have been identified with the Biblical Philistines ever since the works of Jean-François Champollion in the early 19th century. Like the Sea Peoples in general however, there is no real, firm evidence. 

Government Crackdown Beyond vigilante actions, the national hysteria also inspired government suppression. This was enabled by the passage of the Espionage and Sedition Acts, which gave the government legal grounds to prosecute anti-war dissidents. However, the hardest hit was perhaps organised labour; affected businesses created heavy political pressure on the government to strike against the Industrial Workers of the World, a prominent self-described radical organisation that found itself public enemy number one. On 1 August 1917, an angry mob had even lynched IWW Executive Board member Frank Little. Although the Justice Department could find no financial connection between the IWW and Imperial Germany, a nationwide raid of IWW offices was carried out on 5 September 1917. The national leadership was put on trial for "conspiracy to overthrow the government", and rapidly convicted and sentenced to harsh terms by extremist judge Kenesaw Landis (33 to ten years and 15 to 20 years). This was followed by prosecutions of local officials, effectively killing the IWW as a relevant force. 

In terms of actual writing on silk found, you already have your answer. The Chu Silk Manuscript you linked dates to 300 B.C., and is the earliest known silk manuscript. There are some other documents found together with it but AFAIK those were never published in their entirety. Most excavated documents from this era (Warring States, 475-221 B.C.) comes in the form of bamboo and wooden slips. Silk in general were not well preserved. That manuscript is actually series of drawings surrounding some annotating text. Two other silk paintings are known to exist from the Warring States period, and may slightly pre-date the Chu Silk Manuscript: 

Prior to 209, the oldest living former censor was by tradition appointed the princeps senatus. As a matter of custom, this patrician would be re-nominated to the position until his death, at which point the next most senior former censor succeeds him. In this year, the first recorded instance of the censors disagreeing on who to nominate as the princeps occurred. M. Cornelius Cethegus argued in support of the tradition of appointing the senior ex-censor, whereas his colleague P. Sempronius Tuditanus supported Q. Fabius Maximus, who was censor in 230. T. Manlius Torquatus, the traditionalist candidate, was senior to Fabius by one year. After an apparently fierce debate, Sempronius prevailed and Fabius became princeps senatus. The episode is reported by Livy in his Ab Urbe Condita Libri: 

Calvinism represented opposition to the absolutism. It therefore naturally appealed to the political sensibilities of the French nobility vis-à-vis the monarchy. This led to many of them eagerly adopting Calvinist doctrines. 

The few surviving instances of lèse-majesté laws still in force today could be considered an example. While they were widely accepted historically, for obvious reasons they are now commonly considered hopelessly antiquated. Nonetheless, it's still on the books of several countries, including even liberal democracies like the Netherlands or Denmark. However, their continuing prosecution of offenders does not appear to have resulted in any notable levels of violence. Another example might be the suppression of the Hundred Schools of Thought in China. This was first attempted under the Qin dynasty, and then rather more successfully in the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty. Although the generally brutal Qin regime enforced the policy with characteristic violence, Emperor Wu was much more restrained - his ban primarily concerned only the public sector, and did not appear to have resorted to overt violence. In both cases, no violent resistance occurred specifically in association with the policies. In Qin's case, this was likely because the people had much more pressing things to worry about, i.e. the brutal regime's heavy taxation - within a few years a series of peasant revolts brought the empire down. In Han's case, Emperor Wu made knowledge in Confucianism the key criteria for job advancement in his empire, and in this way let the opposing schools literally die out in obscurity. Lastly, a possible example is the Great Schism of Christianity, which was rooted in disputes over some finer points of theology, such as the idea of papal primary. In 1054, (representatives of) the Papacy and the Ecumenical Patriarch excommunicated each other over these and other differences (and politics). Given the weight of excommunication in this highly religious era, one could say Western Christendom banned the Byzantine version of theology, while Eastern Christendom banned the Roman interpretation thereof. The underlying ideas are apparently controversial enough, that almost 1,000 years later, the two sides have yet to fully resolve their differences. No significant violence resulted - in fact most contemporary Christians probably didn't notice the split at all. More importantly, support for each side of the controversy was split among geographic terms. That is, the finer points of theology in dispute was controversial in Christianity as a whole, but each half of Christendom largely supported the same interpretation, so the "bans", so to speak, didn't incite internal violence. Catholic Crusaders did sack Constantinople in 1204, though this was not directly due to theology. 

Romania was the ancient Roman province of Dacia. Under Roman rule, the province was systematically colonised and developed. It has been theorised that these Roman settlers, intermingling with Romanised native Dacians, become the ancestors of the modern Romanian people. Under this theory, the Romanians inherited a Romance language derived from Vulgar Latin. Some doubts that Latin could have survived in ancient Dacia as an language island surrounded by Slavs. An alternative theory is therefore that the Romanians came from south of the Danube. It is proposed that after the fall of the Roman Empire, the various Romanised peoples of the Balkans migrated northward into modern Romania. This theory, too, has been criticised by writers for evidence: 

Both were surgeons on whaling ships, and wrote of the anatomy of whales. They, and Melville as well, further relied upon the writings of the great naturalist John Hunter, especially his Observations on the Structure and Oeconomy of Whales. Wikipedia has an image of Melville's copy of Beale's book: 

Short Answer: You're both correct. Which date to pick for ending the French Revolution is a matter of opinion. 

Japan's situation was manifestly incomparable to British case. Britain was fed by the whole of her empire and the United States. Japan's overseas conquests were either lost or rapidly being overrun. Britain was supplied by a huge merchant marine and the shipbuilding capabilities of the Free World. Japan's merchant marine was in the bottom of the Pacific. The Royal Navy was supreme in the open seas and could keep Britain's lifelines open. The Imperial Japanese Navy had virtually ceased to exist. Take the differences in British and Japanese merchant marine for example. By the war's end, Japan's merchant marine had been reduced to less than 1.5 million gross tonnes, barely a quarter of its prewar strength. In contrast, Britain commanded a Merchant Navy of 15 million gross tonnes while a staggering 40 million sailed under the American flag. 

Of course, it is obvious to us now that the republic had fallen and a monarchy had taken its place. Yet we should not project modern perspectives onto the ancient Romans. 

(The previous election for Canterbury, in 1796, was voided for bribery on 2 March 1797, and a by-election was held. MP Samuel Elias Sawbridge won again on 10 March only to be removed later in May). Such deployments were a typical experience for all British Militia during the Napoleonic Wars. In this turbulent era, the regular Militia was mobilised and transformed into a reserve force for the Army. Most regiments rotated through deployments outside of their home counties, while volunteer and local militia units were formed to replace their traditional role in home defence. 

[1]: Wikipedia, citing Harold Raugh's The Victorians at War, 1815-1914: An Encyclopedia of British Military History, lists their combined strength as 196,000 in 1876, but this is a small discrepancy. 

Because China was actually pretty far from India. For most of the past millennia, China and India were not "neighbouring countries" in any meaningful sense of the word. Most Chinese empires did not actually stretch all the way to the Indian subcontinent. It seems you're considering China and India based on their modern borders, but that is misleading: modern China possesses vast territories beyond its historic core. Although the Chinese established wide ranging empires at different points of history, they did so from a home country that's roughly located like the red shaded region below: 

Note 2: Regardless of factual accuracy, such numbers are almost completely meaningless, because they do not account for any other difference in demographics besides religion. For example, poorer people were less likely to own slaves than wealthier families. How did the population of southern Jews compare to whites in this regard? It could well be the case that if we normalise for all other factors, we will find no statistically significant difference between Jews and the overall population in terms of slave ownership. Without accounting for all factors, this becomes a case of (as @TomAu pointed out) comparing apples and oranges. 

The date was moved by ten days because that's how many days the Julian calendar was off by. You may have thought the time skip was meant to compensate for the drift of nine days between 325 and 1582. Actually, it appears they were correcting the whole Julian calendar around having the equinox fall on the calendar date decided on by the Council of Nicaea. That is to say, when Wikipedia says the reform was to the vernal equinox to the date set in 325, it meant the literal date, i.e. 21 March. Not the date of 325's equinox corrected for 1582. From inter gravissimas, the papal bull ordering the changes: 

This is how William Camden described the ancient ceremony in his Britannia. There are variations, such as substituting for . I'd be a bit surprised if the site you originally found actually used Latin, though. 

Tofu's origins are not conclusively known. The leading theory, however, is that it was invented during the Western Han Dynasty by Liu An, the king of Huai Nan. The earliest known reference to this is made in the Shiyi (a type of history book that is sort of an unofficial addendum to the official histories) written by a Liang Dynasty official, Xie Chuo (502-557). 

Thus, the primary means of keeping an army fed were supply trains. Every war involved numerous wagons responsible for replenishing an army in the field with supplies from the state's central stockpiles. 

Actual first contact is arguably much older than the earliest records, because the Japanese people partially originates in Korea. This theory argues that the Yayoi people, who brought with them rice cultivation, migrated into Japan from the Korean peninsula and intermingled with the preexisting Jomon population (who are closer to the modern Ryukyuans and Ainu) to form the modern Japanese. 

The Killing a Thief Act of 1532 (24 Hen. 8, c. 5) legalised using lethal force against highway robbers or home burglars as justifiable homicide. 

This is because Americans were used to dealing in quarters at the time the denomination was chosen. During the colonial period, a common unit of currency was one eighths of a Spanish real de a ocho. Since each of these Spanish dollars were worth eight Spanish reales it was habitual to divide the eight-real coin into 12.5% wedges known as bits. Two of these were therefore equivalent to 25% of the Spanish dollar, i.e. 25 cents. When the nascent United States adopted its own currency standard, the original one dollar was based on the aforementioned Spanish dollar. The customary unit of two bits of the Spanish dollar thus became 25 cents of the equivalent United States dollar. 

Trotskyism, and by extension Trotsky himself (and vice versa) was definitely denounced in early Communist Chinese propaganda. Whether or not he was a "hate figure" depends on what criteria you use for that nebulous phrase. Since the question declined to define it, I'll focus on the government's general attitude instead - though personally, I would say it was protrayed as a minor hate figure. Until the early 1980s, Communist China officially denounced Trotskyism as an "anti-Leninism and anti-revolutionary" movement. This party line is largely instigated by Stalin as an extension of his domestic factional politics in the 1930s. Thus, the Stalinist Communists have been denouncing Chinese Trotskyists over political reasons, with little attention given to Trotsky's actual ideology. 

Nelson Mandela and Justice Mtirara ran away to Johannesburg, where a former member of Chief Jongintaba's court worked as an overseer at Crown Mines. He found them both jobs: Mtirara as a clerk, and Mandela a security guard. Their brief careers ended however when Jongintaba tracked them down and ordered them back. Justice returned home and succeeded his father. He passed away in 1974. Mandela meanwhile stayed in Johannesburg and got into politics. 

Moreover, it would be impossible to hide the scale of such an expulsion, and that would have destroyed Israeli reputation worldwide. As has been pointed out, expelling civilian populations from occupied regions is an egregious, black-and-white violation of international law, including treaties Israel is party to. Specifically, the Fourth Geneva Convention Article 49: 

Of course. It wasn't much of a secret. Some 85% of the Soviet military's top positions were removed; the scale alone makes it rather impossible to hide. In fact, knowledge that Stalin had decapitated his own army's backbone was one of the factors motivating Nazi Germany to invade. 

You are referring to the medieval Japanese legal doctrine of , literally, in quarrels, punish both sides. The prescribed punishment varied, but use of the death penalty indeed predates the Tokugawa rise to power after 1600. The earliest example is a law promulgated in April 1445 that mandated beheading. 

1959, by a Belgian missionary named Ji Junghwan, who helped started domestic Korean cheese production at Imsil County. 

Part of the fiction of republicanism was the theoretical authority of the senate to elect emperors. Again, we recognise this to be rubberstamping a late emperor's choices and/or the army's decision. However, again, appearances were nonetheless kept up.
