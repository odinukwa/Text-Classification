Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a toric variety, with $T$ a torus embedded as an open set in $\mathcal{X}$ (and where the algebraic action of $T$ extends to $\mathcal{X}$). As I am not a toric specialist at all, I was wondering if there is a simple description of the "boundary," that is, the closed subvariety $C_T := \mathcal{X} \setminus T$. Example: if $\mathcal{X} = \mathrm{Spec}(k[x,y])$ and $T \cong (k^\times)^2$, then $C_T$ consists of two intersecting (affine) lines. 

Every finite abelian group is the direct product of its cyclic groups of prime order, and every commutative monoid divides a product of its cyclic submonoids. Could these results generalized to locally commutative semigroups? Here a semigroup is called locally commutative if for every idempotent $e \in S$ the semigroup $eSe$ is commutative. 

I want to consider the following problem, which generalises the decision problem to decide if a given finite permutation group is a Frobenius group: 

Let $A \mapsto S$ and $B \mapsto S$ be two schemes over the scheme $S$. Is there a connection between the automorphism group of the scheme $A \otimes_{S} B$ and the automorphism groups of $A$ and $B$ ? What about special cases such as: 

Suppose $A$ is a $k$-algebra, with $k$ a field, and let $\ell$ be a field extension of $k$. Is there an easy way to see/recover $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ in/from $\mathrm{Spec}(A \otimes_k \ell)$, using the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$ ? Important special case: $\ell$ is an algebraic closure of $k$. To illustrate my question, let $\ell$ be an algebraic closure of $k$. Then a maximal ideal $\frak{m}$ of $A$ corresponds to an $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$-orbit of maximal ideals in $A \otimes_k \ell$ (the maximal ideals in $A \otimes_k \ell$ ''over $\frak{m}$''). Is such a thing true for the other prime ideals (and for any field extension $\ell$, not ''just'' algebraic closures) ? Is there a similar way (so using the $\mathrm{Aut}(\ell/k)$-action as above) to describe the closed sets of $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ ? 

What do you know about the complexity of this decision problem, is it in $P$ or in $NP$? Is it in $P$ if we fix $k$? 

So my question, how this seeminly simple argument in the footnote works? When I have $n$ equations, dependent on $m \le n$ parameters, where these parameters underlie $k \le m$ degrees of freedom, why does it follows that $n - k$ equations are independent? Or more abstractly, if I have $n$ equations \begin{align*} y_1 & = \mbox{ equation on } x_1, \ldots, x_m \\ y_2 & = \mbox{ equation on } x_1, \ldots, x_m \\ \vdots \\ y_n & = \mbox{ equation on } x_1, \ldots, x_m \end{align*} Then if I know that the $x_i$ have $k \le m$ degrees of freedom, why does I know instantly that just $n - k$ equations are indepdent, i.e. the other ones follow from the independent ones? For the statement in Kolmogorov's book I have another explanations. If I have $n$ experiments $\mathcal U^{(1)}, \mathcal U^{(2)}, \mathcal U^{(n)}$ then by additivity I have for each single event $A_q^{(i)}$ the linear equation $$ P(A_q^{(i)}) = \sum_{ \begin{subarray}{l} 1 \le q_1 \le r_1, \\ \vdots \\ 1 \le q_{i-1} \le r_{i-1}, \\ 1 \le q_{i+1} \le r_{i+1}, \\ \vdots \\ 1 \le q_n \le r_n \end{subarray}} P(A_{q_1}^{(1)} \ldots A_{q_{i-1}}^{(i-1)} A_q^{(i)} A_{q_{i+1}}^{(i+1)} \ldots A_{q_n}^{(n)}) $$ i.e. summing over all other sets except the one I am looking at. This gives me $r_1 + r_2 + \ldots r_n$ linear equations. Fix some event $A_{q_i}^{(i)}$ from each experiment $\mathcal U^{(i)}$, $i = 1,\ldots, n$, then by using that the events in each individual experiment have to sum to one, and that the sum of all $r$ combinations have to sum to one I can replace the equation $$ P(A_q^{(i)}) = \sum_{ \begin{subarray}{l} 1 \le q_1 \le r_1, \\ \vdots \\ 1 \le q_{i-1} \le r_{i-1}, \\ 1 \le q_{i+1} \le r_{i+1}, \\ \vdots \\ 1 \le q_n \le r_n \end{subarray}} P(A_{q_1}^{(1)} \ldots A_{q_{i-1}}^{(i-1)} A_q^{(i)} A_{q_{i+1}}^{(i+1)} \ldots A_{q_n}^{(n)}) $$ by $$ 1 - \sum_{s \ne q} P(A_s^{(i)}) = 1 - \sum_{\substack{q_1,\ldots, q_n \\ q_i \ne q}} P(A_{q_1}^{(1)} A_{q_2}^{(2)} \ldots A_{q_n}^{(n)}) $$ and substracting one I see that this equation is linear dependent on the other, i.e. by adding all the other for the experiment $\mathcal U^{(i)}$ it could be eliminated. Therefore in the end I have $r_1 + r_2 + \ldots r_n$ linear equations, from which $n$ could be eliminated (one of each $r_i$'s equations). The linear equations have $r$ variables (the compound probabilities), which have to fulfill the additional requiremtn that they sum to one, so $r-1$ of them are independent. So I am left with $$ (r-1) - (r_1 + r_2 + \ldots + r_n - n) $$ parameters, i.e. variables that could be choosen freely, and where the others depend on. Cause I have used everything these no more could be choosen freely. A little example, if I denote the probability space by $(\Sigma, \mathcal F, P)$ and have two experiment (i.e. disjoint decompositions) $$ \Sigma = A + B + C = D + E + F. $$ I get the equations \begin{align*} P(A) & = P(AD) + P(AE) + P(AF) \\ P(B) & = P(BD) + P(BE) + P(BF) \\ P(C) & = P(CD) + P(CE) + P(CF) \\ P(D) & = P(AD) + P(BD) + P(CD) \\ P(E) & = P(AE) + P(BE) + P(CE) \\ P(F) & = P(AF) + P(BF) + P(CF) \end{align*} from which I get \begin{align*} P(A) & = P(AD) + P(AE) + P(AF) \\ P(B) & = P(BD) + P(BE) + P(BF) \\ 1 - P(A) - P(B) & = 1 - ( P(AD) + P(AE) + P(AF) + P(BD) + P(BE) + P(BF) ) \\ P(D) & = P(AD) + P(BD) + P(CD) \\ P(E) & = P(AE) + P(BE) + P(CE) \\ 1 - P(D) - P(E) & = 1 - ( P(AD) + P(BD) + P(CD) + P(AE) + P(BE) + P(CE) ) \end{align*} together with $$ 1 = P(AD) + P(AE) + P(AF) + P(BD) + P(BE) + P(BF) + P(CD) + P(CE) + P(CF) $$ the following $5$ independent equations are left: \begin{align*} P(A) & = P(AD) + P(AE) + P(AF) \\ P(B) & = P(BD) + P(BE) + P(BF) \\ P(D) & = P(AD) + P(BD) + P(CD) \\ P(E) & = P(AE) + P(BE) + P(CE) \\ 1 & = P(AD) + P(AE) + P(AF) \\ & = P(BD) + P(BE) + P(BF) \\ & = P(AD) + P(BD) + P(CD) \end{align*} Therefore from the $9$ "variables" $P(AD), P(AE), \ldots$ I could choose $9 - 5 = 4$ freely, i.e. are independent. 

Let $ z_{1},z_{2},z_{3}$ be three complex numbers of moduli less than or equal to $ 1$. $ w_{1},w_{2}$ are two roots of the equation $$ (z-z_{1})(z-z_{2})+(z-z_{2})(z-z_{3})+(z-z_{3})(z-z_{1})=0$$ Prove that :for $ j =1,2,3$, $$\min\{|z_{j} - w_{1}|,|z_{j} - w_{2}|\}\leq 1$$ holds. Following is geometry method Proof: Let's denote $P(z)=(z-z_1)(z-z_2)(z-z_3)$. Obviously $w_1,w_2$ are the zeroes of $P'(z)$. It is well known (Gauss-Lucas) that for any polynomial $P$, the roots of $P'$ lie in the convex hull of the roots of $P$. Particularly, for a cubic polynomial we can go further; the Marden's theorem states that the roots of $P'$ lie in the foci of the [url=$URL$ inellipse[/url] of the triangle formed by the roots of $P$, i.e. $z_1,z_2,z_3$. Thus, the problem becomes pure geometric. Given a triangle $ABC$, which lies inside of a circle with radius $1$, let $F_1,F_2$ be the foci of the Steiner ellipse. We must prove $\min (AF_1, AF_2)\le 1$. Let $G$ be the centroid of $ABC$, which is the midpoint of $F_1F_2$. It's enough to prove: $$3\min (AF_1, AF_2)^2 \le GA^2+GB^2+GC^2 \tag{1}$$ Indeed, since $GA^2+GB^2+GC^2 \le OA^2+OB^2+OC^2$ for any $O$, assuming $\min (AF_1, AF_2)> 1$ will lead us to a contradiction. Proving $\text{(1)}$ involves some calculations. One approach is to consider an equilateral triangle $A'B'C'$ with its incircle and to project it into $ABC$. My Question:this problem have algebra methos? Thanks 

And the open balls are the sets of the form $v \cdot X^{\mathbb N_0}$ for some finite sequence $v$. Now this metric could be extended, for this define $I_n(u,v)$ to be true iff every infix up to a length $n$ of $u$ is contained as infix in $v$ and vice verse, namely $$ \begin{array}{lcl} I_n(u,v) & \Leftrightarrow & \forall i \exists j : u_{i+k} = v_{j+k}, k = 0,\ldots,n-1\\ & & \forall i \exists j : v_{i+k} = u_{j+k}, k = 0,\ldots,n-1 . \end{array} $$ and define $$ d'(u,v) := \max\left\{ d(u,v), \frac{1}{2^r} \right\} \mbox{ with } r := \max\{ n : I_n(u,v) \}. $$ Here $d'(u,v) < \frac{1}{2^n}$ iff $u,v$ coincide in all their infixes (including the first $n$ symbols) up to a length of $n$. Now $d(u,v) \le d'(u,v)$, so that convergence in $d'$ implies convergence in $d$, and every set that is open with regard to $d'$ is open with regard to $d$ (and also for closed sets), so that the topology induced by $d'$ is a refinement of the topology induced by $d$. Now I want to get results about the open sets and the topology induced by $d'$, and their relations. I already know that $d'$ is not complete. In particular what closed sets with regard to $d$ are open with regard to $d'$ (I already know that not all $d$-closed sets are $d'$-open)? Any suggestions or hints how to attack this problem? 

Let $K_0(Var_k)$ be the Grothendieck ring of $k$-varieties for a field $k$. Let $\mathbb{L}$ denote the class of the affine line over $k$. Let $S$ be a $k$-variety and $[S] \in \mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{L}]$, say $[S] = P(\mathbb{L})$ with $P(\mathbb{L})$ a polynomial in $\mathbb{L}$. Then if $k = \mathbb{F}_q$ is a finite field, one has that $\vert S \vert_q = P(q)$. Call elements of $\mathbb{Z}[\mathbb{L}]$ ''virtual Tate motives." I have read many times that ''after the Tate conjectures,'' if $\Delta$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-variety such that there exists a polynomial $P_{\Delta}(X) \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ for which $\vert \Delta \otimes_{\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})} \mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{F}_q) \vert_q = P_{\Delta}(q)$ for every finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, then for each finite field $k$, the class $[\Delta_k]$ is given by $P_{\Delta}(\mathbb{L})$. (Here, $\Delta_k := \Delta \otimes_{\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})} \mathrm{Spec}(k)$.) I have two questions on this subject. 

A $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal F$ over $\Omega$ is generated by an countable partition if there exits a countable partition $\mathcal B = \{ B_i \}$ of $\Omega$ such that $\mathcal F = \sigma(\mathcal B)$. Now let $\mathcal G$ be an arbitrary $\sigma$-algebra over $\Omega$. Is it possible to find $\sigma$-algebras $\mathcal G_n$ generated by countable partitions approximating $\mathcal G$, i.e. such that $G_1 \subseteq G_2 \subseteq G_3 \subseteq \ldots$ and $\mathcal G = \bigcup_n \mathcal G_n$? One naive idea of me is to take some arbitrary $A_1 \in \mathcal G$, and then set $\mathcal B_1 = \{ A_1, A_1^C \}$ and $\mathcal G_1 = \sigma(\mathcal B_1)$, then take some $A_2 \in \mathcal G$ with $A_2 \cap A_1 = \emptyset$ and set $\mathcal B_2 = \{ A_1, A_2, (A_1\cup A_2)^C \}$ and $\mathcal G_2 := \sigma(\mathcal B_2)$ and so on. But this will not work, for example if $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) \subseteq \mathcal G$ and I choose $A_i := \{ i \}$, then as the "limit" $\sigma$-algebra I will get $\sigma(\{ A_i \}) = \{ M : M \subseteq \mathbb N \mbox{ or } X\setminus M \subseteq \mathbb N \}$, which has not to be the the original $\sigma$-algebra with which I started, for example if $\mathbb G = \mathcal B(\mathbb R)$ if fullfills $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) \subseteq \mathcal G$. 

Proof: Note that $|z_i| = |(x-x_i)(y-y_i) - xy| \leq |x-x_i| |y-y_i| + |x| |y|$. Hence by Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, \begin{align*} \sum |z_i| &\leq \sum |x-x_i| |y-y_i| + n|x| |y| \\ &\leq \sqrt{\sum |x-x_i|^2}\sqrt{\sum |y-y_i|^2} + n|x| |y|.\end{align*}Now we have \begin{align*}\sum |x-x_i|^2 &= \sum \left(|x|^2 + |x_i|^2 + 2{\rm Re}(x\overline{x_i})\right)\\ &= n|x|^2 + n - 2{\rm Re}(x\sum\overline{x_i})\\ &= n|x|^2 + n - 2n{\rm Re}(x\overline{x})\\ &= n(1-|x|^2), \end{align*}the last equality following from ${\rm Re} (x\overline{x}) = x\overline{x} = |x|^2$. Thus $$\sqrt{\sum |x-x_i|^2}\sqrt{\sum |y-y_i|^2} + n|x| |y| = n\left(\sqrt{1-|x|^2}\sqrt{1-|y|^2} + |x| |y|\right) \leq n,$$ where the last inequality is also proven by Cauchy-Schwarz, and we are done. Now I conjecture and try prove(Now I can't prove it) 

Here we are concerned with the space $X^{\omega}$ of infinite sequences. Denote by $F_n(\xi)$ the set of factors (consecutive finite subsequences) of length $n$ and consider the set $$ K_n(\xi) = \xi[1\ldots n] \cdot X^{\omega} \cap \{ \eta \in X^{\omega} : F_n(\eta) = F_n(\xi) \} $$ of all words which share with $\xi$ the first $n$ symbols and all factors of length $n$. Then I want to show that there does not exists a finite number of sets $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_m$ which represent these sets in the sense that for every $\xi$ and $n$ every set $K_n(\xi)$ could be written in the form $w \cdot X_i$ for some $i$ and some $w\in X^*$, i.e. for each $K_n(\xi)$ there is some $i$ and a finite sequence $w$ with $$ K_n(\xi) = w \cdot X_i. $$ I tried to prove that a finite number is not enough, but run out of ideas. Any ideas or suggestions? (A note which might be helpful, the $K_n(\xi)$ are $\omega$-regular sets, meaning there exists a finite automaton accepting them, and so contain an ultimately periodic infinite sequence, and two such sets are equal if they coincide in all there ultimately periodic sequences) 

Following problem though not a research problem if $x,y,z,w$ are postive integers,and such $$xyzw=504(x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2)$$ such example $(x,y,z,w)=(21,63,84,84)$ hold, Now My problem there exist distinct postive integer solution? or find this equation all solution? 

Follwing problem have post MSE,For seven days there was still no answer.so maybe it hard to solve it,so I post here, Let $n,p,q$ be postive integers,slove this diophantine equation $$(n+2)^p-n^q=2$$ I known this is Catalan's Conjecture and special case $n=3$, $URL$ have simple methods. But I ask this question have simple methods(such $n=3$)?
