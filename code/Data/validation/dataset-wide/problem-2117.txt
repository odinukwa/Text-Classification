I am recently new at my job and have yet to be set up for remote access to the company intranet at home. The project communication is not urgent but the project is due near the end of next week. If I were to use my personal email account to communicate with my colleague whom I am working in tandem with, how would this most likely be perceived as? I live in the United States. Given the distinction of work vs personal life balance, how can I communicate the information and minimize disruption to my colleague's personal life balance? Thank you! 

Date of communication Who sent it Exact wording of the request from your manager (If feasible) Context such as where and when it was said Any 3rd party witnesses that can corroborate your story 

What concerns do you have that impedes my progress in the hiring process? How do I compare from what I have said to the ideal candidate you are looking to hire for this position? 

As an IT auditor who is very familiar with SOC 1 / SOC 2 audits, I will answer from experience. As you are undergoing an SOC 1 audit, your company as a service organization must be providing serivices for which your clients rely on for their accurate financial reporting. Your senior management should have prepared an statement of assertions about what services your organization is providing and how such services are provided. Ultimately, senior management signs off on the assertions for the external auditors, not yourself, so this fact alone may somewhat calm your nervousness. If there are any deficiencies noted by the auditors, again it is senior management who will have to provide a management's response. Before I explain how to best work with an auditor, I will tell you what Not to do. 

I recommend your second method. Accept you don't know the answer, but refer the auditor to whoever you feel would be best able to help, such as a senior team lead, or your manager. I would strongly caution against your third method. You can delegate the responsibilities to a vendor, but you cannot delegate accountability for performance. It is your management who is ultimately responsible for third party vendor / risk management. If I were to hear such a statement, it would be a strong red flag for me, as it indicates poor senior management accountability at the entity level (tone at the top). As to how to answer questions from an auditor, the suggestions below should be helpful: 

Closing yourself off to others is not a good idea as it could only alienate you more from others. Keep a positive attitude and do not let frustration interfere with doing quality work. Getting emotional at work is unprofessional and immature and does not solve the underlying problem you are facing. You mention more senior developers as not providing enough guidance, but your reaction of putting up a wall will only impede your goal of obtaining support. People usually do not want to work with someone who is uncooperative / negative. 

Having said the above, my current manager who interviewed me did say at the time of the interview that company finances are tight and he might be restricted from FT hiring for the foreseeable future. No specific timeframe was mentioned. How can I initiate a discussion with my manager, showing my strong interest to transition to a FT employee without appearing arrogant or presumptuous and also bearing in mind the company's budget constraints? 

Your manager's behavior toward you is entirely unprofessional and unacceptable in a professional work place. There are many instances in which one might encounter frustration, the failure of a code compilation which is one among many, along with distasteful / rude emails. A manager is supposed to be a model of self restraint and leadership for his / her team, and your manager allowing emotion to overwhelm reason / rationality runs counter to his purpose in the team. I work better when management is more hands off and sticks to the higher level picture. My suggestion to you is to have a private discussion with your manager, saying how his behavior (swearing etc) is disrupting your work and making it very difficult to continuing working with him. Your manager should be reasonable enough to recognize that his current behavior is detrimental to both his status in the team and your development in your team role. Ultimately, trying to leave is a short term situation, and you are better confronting the source of your unhappiness - your manager rather than merely treating the symptoms. 

I made a possible mistake on a live project at work, how to handle this mess? Written warning from employer for following manager's instruction to deploy bugfix directly to production 

Management should appreciate the extra time for them to prepare the best defense possible, or if the finding is legitimate, to remediate the issue found before the audit report is issued by the auditor. 

I have always been a fan of the situational interview style, as I believe one's past behavior is a strong predictor of one's future behavior in similar circumstances.Today I received some feedback that this question came across as "Aggressive" and a bit strong. Was this question indeed too aggressive? How could I have worded it better for interviewing future candidates? 

Access to the log is kept to the minimum number of users who have the need to know its contents. - Confidentiality Logs entries are locked upon being committed so subsequent changes cannot modify previously written log entries. - Integrity A unique user ID is associated for each user who makes a change. - Nonrepudiation 

Without monitoring, how will you know that your server has not been compromised? There are multiple ways compromise can happen... How do you plan for future growth of your customer base when server capacity and performance monitoring is not done? The list of malware and the methods used to compromise computers are growing. Without timely patching, how do you plan on protecting the data of your customers? 

Yesterday at work, I was finishing my morning espresso when my phone rang and in reaching for it, accidentally spilled some of the drink on the computer keyboard. I immediately unplugged the equipment and used paper towels to absorb as much of the liquid as possible, especially between the keys. So far, no damage has manifested itself, but I know damage to computers due to spilled liquids may not be immediate. I am well liked at my company and have a good relationship with my peers and manager alike. My performance according to my most recent evaluation is excellent. My manager is very personable. I feel terrible for my actions. I accept responsibility for any damage that might appear. My sloppiness in this case might have caused loss to the company and in hindsight, trying to do both actions was definitely not a good idea. I tried to salvage the situation to the best of my ability, but am uncertain about how my boss will respond / repercussions that may follow. Should I inform my manager of this incident and if so, how can I do so most constructively? 

I also highly suggest you follow up with an email to your manager to document this instance in order to protect yourself if your manager were to use this point against you, for example, in your periodic evaluations. I work in audit, a job that calls for precise communication, and one in which feedback is not always welcome. Documenting one's communication in writing minimizes misunderstanding from both sides, and helps with objectivity when giving feedback. 

The answers to these questions matter. If your company is publicly traded in the US, then it is subject to the Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) law, and specific sections, namely section 404 mandates personal responsibility for senior management in establishing internal controls over financial reporting. While no specific internal controls are listed in the SOX law, business processes that impact the integrity of financial reporting of a company are becoming more and more integrated with IT. Hence inadequate IT security / controls in your company is no longer just an IT security problem, but a business problem, which costs the firm money. Senior management in the past have had gone to jail for false attestation under SOX. Even if the the SOX law does not apply in the case your company is privately held, such practices are still extremely ill-advised from both a business and IT security perspective. Consider implications of what your company's current practice mean in questions below. 

You can say that you did not feel the culture of the company was a good fit for you. Reasonable people should be able to understand this. Mention that you prefer a more open / collaborative culture where teamwork is stressed. 

with a grain of salt - doubtful , skeptical par for the course - as expected or the normal result nitty gritty - fine details 

As you are still a junior developer, your senior may not have had enough trust in you given the risks of mistakes in live production environment. This should not be taken personally, as your experience will grow with the time spent at your company. It should also be somewhat comforting for you to know that without access, if something were to go wrong, you would not be suspect, given you never could have accessed production, even if you wanted to.
