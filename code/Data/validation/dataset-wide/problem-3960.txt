A positive answer to a related question which may very well been behind your question is that if $L$ is an algebraic extension of the field $K$ and every nonconstant polynomial over $K$ has a root in $L$, then $L$ is algebraically closed. The proof of this result is an exercise in Galois theory. 

From my reading of the cited paper, FLT is not really needed. The authors require a recursive sequence of curves $\langle C_i : i \in I \rangle$ for which the following holds: (1) The function $i \mapsto |C_i({\mathbb Q})|$ is computable. (2) There is a function (possibly required to be recursive) $B: \{ g \in \omega : g \geq 2 \} \to \omega$ so that for any $g \geq 2$ and any curve $X$ of genus $g$ over ${\mathbb Q}$ there are no nonconstant maps $C_i \to X$ or $X \to C_i$ for $i \geq B(g)$. The Fermat curves conveniently satisfy these properties, but it is not so hard to build a sequence of curves over the rational numbers of growing genus for which local conditions preclude the existence of rational points and whose Jacobians are simple as abelian varieties (Edit: comment about prime genus removed; instead, one needs to argue that the generic curve does have a simple Jacobian ). 

Induction and strong induction, or what I would prefer to call the least number principle, are not equivalent formula by formula relative to, say, the standard algebraic axioms $\text{PA}^-$ underlying PA expressing that the structure is a discretely ordered semiring whose least element is $0$. However, induction for the class of all $\Sigma_n$ formulas is equivalent to the least number principle for the class of all $\Sigma_n$ formulas for each $n$. Let me give a few details. For a formula $\phi(x)$ define $$I(\phi) := (\phi(0) \& (\forall x)(\phi(x) \to \phi(x+1))) \to (\forall x)\phi(x)$$ while $$L(\phi) := (\exists x) \neg \phi(x) \to (\exists y)(\neg \phi(y) \& (\forall z < y) \phi(z))$$ It is easy to see that $\text{PA}^- \vdash L(\phi) \to I(\phi)$ while $\text{PA}^- \vdash I(\tilde{\phi}) \to B(\phi)$ where $\tilde{\phi}(x) := (\forall y \leq x) \phi(y)$. If $\phi$ is of class $\Sigma_n$ (expressible as a formula with $n$ alternations of unbounded quantifiers starting with $\exists$ and then a string of bounded quantifiers followed by a quantifier free formula) then while $\tilde{\phi}$ not explicitly $\Sigma_n$, it is equivalent to a $\Sigma_n$ formula. Thus, relative to $\text{PA}^-$, we have a level by level equivalence of these principles. It is fairly easy to see by considering structures that are not well-ordered that no formula by formula equivalence can be expected. 

I am little worried by Gowers' comment as this seems fairly straightforward to me. Let $L:{\mathbb C} \to {\mathbb R}$ be a nonconstant affine map vanishing on your ray. I assume that by "line segment" you really mean that $\gamma$ is linear (or affine). In any case, as long as $\gamma$ is real analytic (by which I mean that it extends to a real analytic function on some open neighborhood of $[0,1]$), so is $h := L \circ f \circ \gamma$. A real analytic function on a compact interval is either always zero or has only finitely many zeros. If $h$ is identically zero, then your curve will stay on the line containing your ray and can enter or leave the ray only finitely many times. If $h$ is not identically zero, then your curve meets the ray only finitely many times. 

The theory of arithmetic motivic integration (see, for example, the paper by Denef and Loeser in the proceedings of the 2002 ICM) takes into account the numbers you wish to encode in your two variable zeta function. As Kevin Buzzard rightly points out, if the scheme is smooth, then the counts along powers of primes do not give much additional information. This motivic theory is useful only in so far as it allows for possible singularities. 

Yes. This result usually goes under the name of Weil's theorem on group chunks. The original reference is: A. Weil, On algebraic groups of transformations, Am. J. Math, 77, 1955, 355 - 381. In model theory this theorem has taken on a life of its own and is the basis of Hrushovski's theorem on generically presented groups. A model theoretic treatment of Weil's theorem, including a weakening where one is allowed to use negative powers of the Frobenius, may be found in E. Bouscaren, Model theoretic versions of Weil's theorem on pregroups, in The Model Theory of Groups, Notre Dame Mathematical Lectures, Number 11 The analogous results are known at least for compactifiable complex analytic groups and real algebraic groups. The following paper gives a good general treatment of these problems. L. van den Dries, Weil's group chunk theorem: a topological setting, Ill. J. Math, 34 no. 1, 1990, 127 - 139. 

The standard definition of $(A_\alpha)_{\alpha \in B}$ a family of sets indexed by a set $B$ is that one is given a function $A$ with domain $B$ so that for $\alpha \in B$ we understand $A_\alpha$ as $A(\alpha)$. Then, yes, the product is a set. The function $A$ itself is an element of the powerset of $B \times \text{ran}(A)$ (where $\text{ran}(A)$ is the range of $A$) and the product $\prod_{\alpha \in B} A_\alpha$ is by definition the set of functions $f$ with domain $B$ having the property that $(\forall \alpha \in B) f(\alpha) \in A(\alpha)$. As such, one proves that the product exists by applying the comprehension axiom to the above defining formula observing that any such $f$ will be an element of the powerset of $B \times \bigcup \text{ran} A$. [And yes, the Axiom of Choice merely says that the product is nonempty if all of the $A_\alpha$ are nonempty.] 

It is not necessary to assume the existence of a cross-section to conclude the relative completeness part of the Ax-Kochen-Ershov theorem, but for the more refined relative quantifier elimination is not true in general without the cross section. Let me explain. First of all, we should make a slight correction to your statement of the Ax-Kochen theorem. The existence of an isomorphism between V and V' requires the continuum hypothesis. [See Shelah, Saharon, Vive la diffÃ©rence. II. The Ax-Kochen isomorphism theorem, Israel J. Math. 85 (1994), no. 1-3, 351--390, in which Shelah shows that there models of ZFC in which there are nonprincipal ultrafilters ${\mathcal U}$ on the primes for which $\prod_{\mathcal U} {\mathbb F}_p((t))$ and $\prod_{\mathcal U} {\mathbb Q}_p$ are not isomorphic.] What Matthew Morrow says about completeness relative to $RV(F)$ is correct (mathematically, though not historically --- these structures have been studied under different names, by for example, Franz-Viktor Kuhlmann and Serban Basarab, in connection with quantifier elimination and relative completeness and by the founders of the theory of valued fields already in the 1930s. I discuss these structures in detail in my paper published in the proceedings of the 1999 workshop on valuation theory in Saskatoon). There are many suitable languages for understanding RV, but the following might be the most straight forward. We give ourselves four sorts: VF for the valued field, RV for the residue-valuation sort, $\Gamma$ for the value group, and $k$ for the residue field. On VF and k we have the language of rings, on RV the language of multiplicative groups and on $\Gamma$ the language of ordered abelian groups. These sorts are connected by the natural quotient map $r:K^\times \to RV(K) = K^\times/(1 + {\mathfrak m})$, the valuation map $v:K^\times \to \Gamma$, the induced valuation map (still denoted by $v$) $v:RV \to \Gamma$, the reduction map $\pi:{\mathcal O} \to k$, and the natural inclusion $\iota:k^\times \to RV$. It should be clear that $k$ and $\Gamma$ are interpretable in RV with its full induced structure. That is, if we would prefer to work with a two-sorted language, then we should treat RV as a structure with multiplication, a predicate for the image of $\iota$, a three place predicate for addition on the image of $\iota$ and a two-place relation $V(x,y)$ to be interpreted as $v(x) \leq v(y)$. In this language it is now the case that if $K$ and $L$ are unramified henselian fields (so either $k(K)$ and $k(L)$ have residue characteristic zero or the residue characteristic is $p > 0$ and $v(p)$ is the least positive element of the value group), then $K$ and $L$ are elementarily equivalent (in the two-sorted language described above) if and only if $RV(K)$ and $RV(L)$ are elementarily equivalent. Moreover, the theory of unramified henselian fields eliminates quantifiers relative to RV in the sense that for any formula $\phi$ there is another formula $\psi$ for which the quantifiers only range over RV for which the theory of unramified henselian fields proves that $\phi$ is equivalent to $\psi$. Now, one may deduce the relative completeness theorem for the residue field and value group from the corresponding relative completeness theorem for RV. The point is that $RV(K)$ and $RV(L)$ are elementarily equivalent if and only if $k(K)$ and $k(L)$ are elementarily equivalent as fields and $\Gamma(K)$ and $\Gamma(L)$ are elementarily equivalent as ordered groups. Why? The question is absolute, so we may prove the result under the assumption of the continuum hypothesis. We can replace $K$ and $L$ with elementarily equivalent saturated models of size $\aleph_1$, $K^\ast$ and $L^\ast$, respectively. From the saturation hypothesis, cross-sections $\chi_K:\Gamma(K^\ast) \to RV(K^\ast)$ and $\chi_L:\Gamma(L^\ast) \to RV(L^\ast)$ exist as do isomorphisms $k(K^\ast) \cong k(L^\ast)$ and $\Gamma(K^\ast) \cong \Gamma(L^\ast)$. Since with $\chi$, RV splits as a product, we conclude that $RV(K^\ast) \cong RV(L^\ast)$. In particular, $RV(K) \equiv RV(K^\ast) \equiv RV(L^\ast) \equiv RV(L)$ so that $K$ and $L$ are elementarily equivalent by the weak form AKE for RV. Quantifier elimination simply relative to the residue field and value group is not true. For example, in ${\mathbb Q}((t))$ the elements $t^2$ and $5 t^2$ have the same [relative to the residue field and value group] quantifier-free type (ie they agree on all formulas in which only quantification over $k$ and $\Gamma$ are allowed) but they do not have the same type as the first is a square and the second is not. Generalizing the RV construction to include sorts $RV_n$ to be interpreted as $RV_n(K) = K^\times/(1 + n {\mathfrak m})$ one may obtain a relative quantifier elimination and completeness theorem for all henselian fields of characteristic zero. That is, without any restriction on ramification.
