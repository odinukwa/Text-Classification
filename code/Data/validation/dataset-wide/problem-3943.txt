Your understanding of the definition is incorrect, but that is probably because the cited nLab page is misleading. Let me spell it out a little bit more accurately: 

The point is that the reflection rule makes $p = \mathsf{refl}_x$ a well-formed expression. This turns out to be incredibly dangerous: now we can prove it by induction on equality. More precisely: 

Perhaps these slides will be helpful. I'll try to explain what happens in your special case. Let $M$ be a monoid and let $\mathcal{B} M$ be the topos of right $M$-sets. The points of $\mathcal{B} M$ are the left $M$-sets $P$ that satisfy the following conditions: 

Does this construction generalise when binary coproducts don't exist? What about when the required free object doesn't exist? Is there a (even) more general way to describe this operation of "adjoining an indeterminate", e.g. when there's no notion of pointed objects? 

The answer is yes. It is clear that the extremal monomorphisms $(V_0, E_0) \to (V_1, E_1)$ are precisely the full graph embeddings, i.e. maps $f : V_0 \to V_1$ such that $f$ is injective and $(a, b) \in E_0$ if and only if $(f (a), f (b)) \in E_1$. It is also clear that regular monomorphisms are graph embeddings, so it remains to be shown that every full graph embedding is a regular monomorphism. But this is straightforward: given a graph $(V_1, E_1)$ and a full subgraph $(V_0, E_0)$, we can easily construct a graph $(V_2, E_2)$ containing two isomorphic copies of $(V_1, E_1)$ as full subgraphs whose intersection is isomorphic to $(V_0, E_0)$; then $(V_0, E_0)$ is the equaliser of the two embeddings $(V_1, E_1) \to (V_2, E_2)$. 

The effective topos is an example of a (locally!) cartesian closed category with NNO where infinite coproducts do not exist. Indeed, the main feature of the NNO $N$ in the effective topos is that the endomorphisms of $N$ are precisely the computable functions. As such, $N$ cannot be (isomorphic to) $\coprod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} 1$: if that were the case, then there would be uncountably many endomorphisms of $N$. (Of course, $\coprod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} 1$ does not even exist in the effective topos; as you say, if it existed, it would have to be the NNO.) Here is a closely related construction. Suppose we have a countable model $M$ of Zermelo set theory, or even just Mac Lane set theory. (For instance, by Skolem, we may take $M$ to be a countable elementary substructure of $V_{\omega + \omega}$.) Then the category of sets in $M$ is an elementary topos (so locally cartesian closed) with NNO, but its NNO cannot be $\coprod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} 1$, for the same reason. 

No, it is not always true. For instance, suppose $G$ is the forgetful functor from monoids to sets. Then $F$ is the free monoid functor, and the two maps in question are $$((x_{1,1}, \ldots, x_{1,n_1}), \ldots, (x_{m,1}, \ldots, x_{m,n_m})) \mapsto (x_{1,1} \cdots x_{1,n_1}, \ldots, x_{m_1} \cdots x_{m,n_m})$$ $$((x_{1,1}, \ldots, x_{1,n_1}), \ldots, (x_{m,1}, \ldots, x_{m,n_m})) \mapsto (x_{1,1}, \ldots, x_{1,n_1}) \cdots (x_{m_1}, \ldots, x_{m,n_m})$$ More concretely, if we identify $F G 1$ with $\mathbb{N}$ and $F G F G 1$ with finite lists of natural numbers, then the two maps are (respectively) $$(x_1, \ldots, x_m) \mapsto m$$ $$(x_1, \ldots, x_m) \mapsto x_1 + \cdots + x_m$$ which are obviously not the same. It's worth pointing out that the equation holds if and only if $F$ and $G$ form an idempotent adjunction. In particular, it is true when $G$ is fully faithful. 

Here is a tentative definition based on finitary unbiased monoidal categories – I make no claims of usefulness! An infinitary unbiased monoidal category consists of the following data: 

In fact, the coherence conditions above degree 2 are automatic if all the triangles commute. Thus we see that an object in $\operatorname{holim} A$ is the same thing as a pseudocone over $A$ (where we regard $A$ as a pseudofunctor with the canonical coherence data). Unsurprisingly, the morphisms are the same, so $\operatorname{holim} A$ (as constructed above) is the pseudolimit of $A$. 

Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a finitary algebraic theory. For each $\mathbb{T}$-algebra $A$, let $Q (A)$ be the join semilattice of finitely generated congruences on $A$. There is an evident pushforward operation, yielding a functor $Q$ from the category of $\mathbb{T}$-algebras to the category of join semilattices. Let $f : A \to B$ be a homomorphism of finitely presented $\mathbb{T}$-algebras. Say $f : A \to B$ is a weak $Q$-equivalence if $Q (f) : Q (A) \to Q (B)$ is an isomorphism of join semilattices. It is easy to find examples of weak $Q$-equivalences that are not isomorphisms. (For example, this happens when $\mathbb{T}$ is the theory of commutative rings: take $A$ and $B$ to be finite fields.) Say $f : A \to B$ is a strong $Q$-equivalence if it satisfies the following condition: 

By definition, a $\mathbf{U}$-pretopos is a category $\mathcal{C}$ that satisfies Giraud's axioms except for the existence of topological generators, i.e. 

It is easy to generalise the proof that the algebraic theory of rings has the strict terminal object property: indeed, for any algebraic theory with two constants $0$ and $1$ and a binary operation for which $0$ is a (left) absorbing element and $1$ is a (left) unit, the trivial model is strictly terminal. Another easy observation is that any algebraic theory that "interprets" an algebraic theory with the strict terminal object property must itself have the strict terminal object property. (Here, $T$ interprets $T'$ if there is a map from the operations of $T'$ to the operations of $T$ that preserves the multi-composition and projections.) So a natural follow-up question is, 

Allow me to make some comments as someone who converted to the universeful approach recently; but take it with a pinch of salt, as I have only been studying category theory for 2½ years. I should briefly mention the trigger that led me to the pro-universe camp: about 6 months ago, I started learning about quasicategories and became convinced that the theory relied on far too much machinery to admit a workable elementary approach that would allow us to consider entities like the quasicategory of all Kan complexes within an NBG-like framework – which is the the raison d'être for quasicategories in the first place! So I decided that I would have to start taking universes seriously – and for this purpose the universes would not merely be for bookkeeping but for doing actual mathematics in. If all we wanted to do was to ensure that sets of large cardinality and high complexity exist, it would probably be enough to just have a chain $M_0 \in M_1 \in M_2 \in \cdots$ of (transitive) models of set theory (say, ZFC), but I find this very unsatisfactory. For instance, consider theorems that assert that some object with some universal property exist: there is no guarantee that a universal object in $M_0$ remains universal in $M_1$. Indeed, one such theorem says that, for every set $X$, there exists a set $\mathscr{P}(X)$ and a binary relation $[\in]_X \subseteq X \times \mathscr{P}(X)$ such that, for every binary relation $R \subseteq X \times Y$, there is a unique map $r : Y \to \mathscr{P}(X)$ such that $\langle x, y \rangle \in R$ if and only if $\langle x, r(x) \rangle \in [\in]_X$. Of course, it is well-known that powersets need not be preserved when passing from one model of set theory to another. But if something as trivial as powersets is not preserved, what hope is there of preserving more complicated universal objects like the free ind-completion of a category, or even the free monoid on one generator (i.e. $\mathbb{N}$!)? For a category theorist, to work in a setting where universal objects have to be qualified by a universe parameter is simply untenable. So, we have to find some kind of compromise: we need a chain of universes such that each universe is embedded in the next in as pleasant a way as possible, so that the mathematics in one universe agrees with the next as much as is feasible. The most ideal situation one could hope for goes something like this: 

There are several possible definitions of initial object in a 2-category $\mathfrak{K}$; which one is appropriate depends on your applications. 

Classical propositional logic is basically a boolean algebra, which may be viewed as a poset, which may be viewed as a category. We at the very least need to fix the primitive predicates; then the objects of the category are the well-formed formulae, and we have a morphism $P \to Q$ if and only if $\{ P \} \vdash Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are well-formed formulae. Under this scheme, the product is logical conjunction, the coproduct is logical disjunction, and the exponential is material implication. (Write out the universal properties in logical form and you'll see they correspond to the natural deduction rules for the respective logical operators.) We may also talk about the category of boolean algebras, where the morphisms are boolean algebra homomorphisms, but I think that's not what you're looking for. As for first-order logic — a similar thing can be done, but now we have to introduce several (indeed, infinitely many) categories. Firstly, recall that a formula in first-order logic can have free variables. Formulae that have the same free variables live in the same categories; as before we have a morphism $\phi(x, y, \ldots, z) \to \psi(x, y, \ldots, z)$ iff $\{ \phi(x, y, \ldots, z) \} \vdash \psi(x, y, \ldots, z)$, and we have categorical products, coproducts, and exponentials corresponding to $\land$, $\lor$, and $\implies$ as before. What do $\forall$ and $\exists$ correspond to? Well, remember that the formulae inside a given category have the at most a particular set of free variables, so these operations necessarily take objects from one category to another, i.e. they must be functors of some kind, and indeed they are. Let $\mathrm{Form}(x, y, \ldots, z)$ denote the category of formulae with free variables contained in $\{ x, y, \ldots, z \}$. Trivially, we have inclusion functors $* : \mathrm{Form}(x, y, \ldots, z) \to \mathrm{Form}(x, y, \ldots, z, t)$. Conversely, $\forall t$ is a functor $\mathrm{Form}(x, y, \ldots, z, t) \to \mathrm{Form}(x, y, \ldots, z)$. It turns out $\forall t$ is a right adjoint for $*$ — writing out the definition of adjunction gives the natural deduction rules for $\forall$ introduction and elimination. Similarly, $\exists t$ is a functor of the same type, and is a left adjoint of $*$. This categorical viewpoint of logic is discussed at various points in Awodey's Category Theory, but is not the main aim of the book.
