1.) I would be hesitant to advise you to put them in the dryer. I've never tried or experienced it myself, and my evidence is completely anecdotal, but I've heard that the neoprene has the potential to turn brittle if exposed to forced heating. 2.) The two main things to consider when drying out gloves like this (as well as other things like boots, socks, etc) is this: 

I have the Garmin Etrex 20 and I use it for everything from geocaching, to wilderness and kayaking navigation. Obviously this answer is just based on my personal experience with the device, I can't speak for anybody else. Loading, displaying, and entering in new caches or locations doesn't take very long at all. After I learned where all the menus and sub-menus were located, it only took me a matter of seconds to enter information. In fact, in some ways, I find it easier than using a touchscreen because you don't have to take off and gloves or remove it from its protective case. I have never had the GPS "crash" or freeze up or anything and have been using it fairly regularly for about a year. I've updated the GPS a couple of times and haven't had any problems at all. The Basecamp software that Garmin uses on the computer is rather badly thought-out and the user-experience isn't great, but once you learn how to use it, it's not bad. Also, the Basecamp software isn't 100% necessary to use with the GPS. I've found the ergonomics to be good. Using the "thumbstick" has never been tiring for me, even after manually entering many geocache coordinates. It fits well in my hand and the rubberized coating keeps it from slipping. I would recommend getting a protective case for it, one that you can clip to your backpack or belt. 

I have a 24' diameter Tipi that I use for this type of thing and it works great. I have a small coal fire going the entire time and with 6 people it is plenty warm and spacious. I have had as many as 10 people staying it and it fit gear and cots no problem but it started to get crowded. I have gone with just a blanket down to about 30 degrees Fahrenheit comfortably. I made mine for about $400, and it takes about 20-30 minutes for me to setup by myself. For tents, a buddy of mine has a 14' x 17' x 5' Outfitter tent and it is amazing. Those of us over 6ft can stand up no problem in it and the stove is much more intensive than what I can do in my Tipi. This last summer he picked up the Cook Shack extension which should give it a separate room for cooking and dining, but I have not been out with him with the extension yet. Just setting up the main tent though is difficult. It takes 4+ people more than an hour. But it is very sturdy. He does not have the one with the floor sewn in, he has some kind a soft tarp and recently strips of carpet form another friend that recently renovated his house. With the Tipi or the Outfitter tent, they are pretty comfortable in the desert in the summer as well, as long as the coal fire and stove are not going. Both of the tents you listed look to make great group tents. Both are more than large enough to accommodate a table as well as sleeping space. Neither tent, however, is designed to be cooked in and I would NOT recommend cooking in either. 

When setting up a rappel anchor, using things like webbing, rings, that kind of stuff, what happens to the anchor when you get to the bottom? Assuming you can't hike to the top and grab it, do you most people leave it behind? I've seen some instances where people don't use artificial anchors, but just wrap the rope around a tree and then pull the rope down when they're done. It seems awfully wasteful, and against LNT to just leave a bunch of webbing on a rock. Thanks! 

Obviously safety is usually a relative concept, what seems safe for you might not be for others, so answers here may vary. I don't have experience with geocaching, but I do have a lot of experience with reptiles. I'm a hobbyist wildlife photographer specializing in reptiles, amphibians and insects. When reaching into an unknown area, the safest thing that I do is first use a long stick to sweep the area. In your case, if you thought a cache was in a tree hole, you could use a long stick to sweep around inside. This is usually good enough to scare away snakes, any mammals and lizards. Most reptiles are not territorial in the way that mammals are so it's fairly easy to scare them off. As far as spiders or other dangerous insects, usually the stick is enough, but I would still recommend wearing thick gloves if you're worried. There are even kevlar reinforced gloves that make venomous snake handling safer, but they are fairly expensive. Other visually observing the hole, or using another tool (such as a stick) to clear the hole, I don't know of any foolproof methods of making sure a cache area would be 100% safe. 

Looking for something with a shade is not as important. I rub some sunscreen on them and reapply after a few hours. This works well enough in the Sonoran desert. For infants we have used and liked the Beco butterfly but it offers no storage, it's just great with infants. It has the added benefit of, when we need/want to cover ground quickly, allowing my wife to carry the infant front and breastfeed while hiking. When they are crawling on their own and starting to pull themselves up we switch to our larger pack. Which is a Kelty, but an older model that I can't find online right now. 

No. It's a good thought, but I have had one that I have inflated by mouth for over 10 years. I usually store it valve open partially inflated. I live in Arizona and the temp in the shed can get to over 150 degrees F some days so valve closed would cause the bubble to pop. It has never given me trouble. I have heard that this is an issue from people who have never owned one before, and usually as a selling point for solid mattresses. But I have never heard it as an issue from someone who owned one. 

I've been reading this book about mountain scrambling in Washington State, U.S., and at some points it mentions the idea of using a hand line on some more exposed routes to give something to hold on to, as well as mental reassurance to less experienced climbers. This whole book is supposed to be about "non-technical climbs" so I was wondering how one would go about setting up a hand line like this. Presumably, the most able climber in the group would go forward and anchor a rope along the route for other climbers in the party to use? How would you do this safely (is this even possible to do safely)? My personal (relatively inexperienced) opinion is that if you're at the point where you're considering using a rope for safety, the route is either beyond your skill level, or you should be doing proper technical climbing. Thanks! 

Not sure if they carry the diameter you are looking for but when a spigot breaks on one of my canisters I usually go to Ace Hardware and pickup a replacement. I have had good luck with Rubbermaid ones. I would expect stores like Home Depot or Lowes to have them as well. The Reliance ones work if the mouth is the same size, I like them because you can turn the spigot inside when transporting or not in use. 

So every winter working in the dry cold, my skin, on my hands and feet, cracks. Particularly between my fingers and toes. What can I do to prevent this? 

So I built my survival shelter and I decide a nice fire would really warm things up. Is there a way I can build a fire that would heat the shelter without too much smoke? I know I could make the shelter better and warmer, and I would need to sit and stare at the fire making sure it didn't burn the shelter down. Is there a way to build a fire to do this? Side note, I am assuming a typical low crawl in shelter, would there be a better one to use with fire? 

Another tip (although this wasn't asked in the question) is to keep the smell from neoprene things like this (they often start to smell pretty bad if sweat is allowed to sit in them for too long) is to dry them out thoroughly every time. If you've sweated pretty heavily in them, gently rinse them with cool water and possibly mild soap depending on the material and then let them dry. This will prolong the life of your gear and make them not stink like a sock. EDIT: To answer the addition to your question: I think silica gel could certainly help, and I've got a friend who has used it successfully on hiking boots, but it definitely took a lot longer than the absorption/air drying method. 

Well does it? Or does it only grow on one side? Or does it grow only on the side further from the equator? Is there any truth to this old adage? 

Do not leave part of the rope hanging from above the stick across the bag as shown in the pic. This defeats the purpose of the stick. If you are in a low enough area that there aren't any trees, then the wildlife is less of a concern. In those areas, I have often left packs on the ground or on a table and had no issues. The main concern in these areas is squirrels and depending on the side of the mountains you are on, skunks. If you have a way you can suspend it off the ground using sticks and/or bushes, this would be best. If not, plan ahead and have a bear bag of some variety. Since the main concern, at this elevation, is rodent, a frame-less bag would work just fine. The Squirrels in the pine covered areas will barter. If you lose something and a pine cone is sitting where you are sure you set it down, a squirrel took it and left you a pine cone in trade. This is most common with food, but if you regularly use scented hand lotion it will rub off on other things, like digital cameras. Look up and around and you can usually find the culprit. Powered Gatorade is a great idea. We usually put 1 teaspoon of salt per 10oz of water in our containers. This doesn't gum up any bladders and is barely taste-able. It, along with some regular snacking, usually does more than enough for the group I go with, but we also live in that climate. Flipping over rocks with a hand is a bad idea, but kicking them if you have good boots usually isn't a bad idea. Also avoid bushes near large rocks or short rock cliffs, these are prime places for snakes. Spring time depending on how early or late with determine how many snakes are out. Right now, early April, there are very few if any out. In May they will start to show up in force. You asked about Pumas. We call them Mountain Lions. Same thing. They actually have more nicknames than any other animal on earth. Usually they leave you alone, unless it is an extremely dry year. In which case, prevention, avoidance, and defense is the same here as everywhere else. 

I've always either used 3-in-1 oil or the gun oil, the kind used for cleaning and caring for firearms. These both have always worked fine for me for years and years of use. Usually I just wipe a small coating of the oil on with a shop rag before leaving it for a while. Make sure it's clean and dry before applying the oil. EDIT: AFAIK the type of oil or ingredients shouldn't make too much of a difference. As mentioned in another answer, the oil is there to repel water (which causes rust and ruins the blade) and protect against dirt. So any type of basic household oil should work fine. 

Both my fiancee and myself bought some climbing gear recently and we're planning our first trip to an indoor rock gym this weekend. We decided to practice our knots and belay technique before we went so we rigged some rope to a chin-up bar to practice letting one person hang while the other person held the "brake" position to get used to how it would feel. The problem is, while I could hold my fiancee just fine, she weighs about 70 lbs less than me and had a really hard time holding my weight, in fact she could barely hold it at all. I'm worried that she won't be able to hold me if I were to fall while climbing. Surely, we can't be the first climbing pair to have different weights...is there a way to fix this? Is there any mechanical advantage of having the "lever" of the top rope much higher than the practice chin-up bar is? EDIT: From some research, it seems like there may be a difference when top-roping vs. lead climbing? For reference, we will only be doing top-roping for the foreseeable future. FOLLOW-UP: We just got back from climbing for the first time today at an indoor gym and we didn't have any trouble at all. My partner anchored herself to the ground as mentioned in the answers and the weight wasn't even an issue. Thanks for any insights! 

I think what you are looking for is Century Camping gear. It is mostly made in USA and they have all the accessories that you are looking for. If something they sell is made elsewhere, they note the country of origin in the product specs. Coleman still makes some stuff here but most of it is in China now. You have to check the individual box for them. You might also want to try REI.com. They are a great camping site and their online store has a button to show only made in USA items. I tested this and found it odd that they flagged all Century Camping gear as imported when only 1 of their stoves is actually imported. 

Aggressive Climbing shoes are often also referred to as Cambered. The Arch of the foot and/or the toe point downward. Non-aggressive shoes have a flat bottom. Images compliments of rei.com. Some people will use the term aggressive to mean tighter as well, but I have seen that to be less common. You want your shoes to be crazy tight, regardless of their shape. Also, the more aggressive the shoe, usually the longer break in period and the more painful. This shoe is tilted but you can see the bottom is pretty flat. It is "non-aggressive"
