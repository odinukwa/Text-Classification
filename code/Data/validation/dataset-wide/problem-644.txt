The frame is almost certainly a 68mm English-threaded shell. Beyond that, the cranks you're using and the desired chainline determine the bottom bracket spindle length. If the rest of the bike is stock, BikePedia claims that the crankset is a TruVativ Touro Track. The Truvativ Crankset docs specify a 108mm bottom bracket with that crankset giving you a 43.5mm chainline. Reducing that by a half millimeter or so by switching to a 107mm bottom bracket should be just fine. 

I'd take a close look at your dropout and your QR skewer. The rotating disc exerts an upward force on the disc caliper, which tends to want to push the dropout up and away from the axle (or as normally stated, pushes the axle down and out of the dropout). Some calculations at Jules & James' comprehensive site computes the force generated to be as much as 3800N. To achieve a 6mm offset at the top of the tire you'd need the axle to move about 1mm within the dropout. Try spinning the wheel in a bike stand with the skewer loose enough to allow free sliding but not wheel ejection, and see if you can replicate the same effect you're seeing out in the real world. 

Basically, given the bike you've shown, if you look for an '26-inch fork, 80mm suspension corrected, 1 1/8" uncut steerer, v-brake posts' you will probably find something suitable. 

You could order your own replacement hub, for example Universal currently lists the 36h Dual Drive (Disc) for $187. These hubs are a relative rarity, and I don't doubt that your LBS price would be above $300. Bianchi presumably got them in bulk for a bargain when they specified this frame. If you're carrying heavy loads upgrading to 36h is certainly a reasonable solution and will definitely help. You can also select a beefier rim - I personally like the Salsa Delgado, but rims such as the Velocity Dyad and Sun Rhyno Lite are perfectly fine as well. Lastly, get a professional wheel build. All told you're probably looking at at least $320, most of which is dominated by the price of your hub. Depending on your riding conditions and preferences, another solution might be to replace your Dual Drive hub with a normal 9-speed derailleur hub. This will cost a bit more than usual in the near term (you'll need to replace the shifter and the derailleur), but you'll have more wheels at your disposal. Craigslist and eBay can be a treasure trove of relatively inexpensive handbuilt wheelsets, if you're patient. 

Aided by the characteristics of self-stability, as noted above, the basic reason a bike stays upright while you are riding it is that you are actively balancing by keeping the contact points of the bike under your center of mass. As you are riding, you are making subtle turning motions to keep the bike underneath you - when the bike falls to the left, you turn left, which moves the front wheel and puts the bike back underneath you. On rollers you can see this as the bike moving back and forth across the roller - and when it can't do that, you fall over. You are able to do this so unconsciously after learning to ride that it's quite a challenge to ride a bike with the steering reversed. 

Get a thin, tropical-weight wool cycling cap. It'll keep the sun off your head but still breathe and wick sweat. I have one from Walz that's been just wonderful. 

I will say that in my experience with an accident like yours, an attorney (like John Duggan, so he's a little biased) will not get directly involved since the stakes are quite low, but it can be handy to have one on hand if the insurance company decides to be difficult. They can answer legal questions applicable in your jurisdiction that the internet can't. And remember, just because the driver admitted fault to you at the scene does not mean they will admit fault to their insurance agency. I'd also advise going to the doctor and getting looked over just in case you do have some more serious injuries. This should ultimately be paid for by their insurance (your insurance will likely ask you if any other insurance is billable for this), including any lost wages if you need to miss work and a pain and suffering payout (typically 3x medical bills). If your collision was anything like mine, be prepared to wake up stiff and sore for a couple of days. John also points out that the claim will cover damage to not only your bike but to any of your accessories or clothing - bag, gloves, pants, lights. Make sure all of these things are undamaged. Take your time here - you do not want to accept a settlement from their insurance and then subsequently discover belatedly that your frame is cracked and you've got a torn ligament that will require surgery. 

Unfortunately, your 1974 Campagnolo 5-speed hubs are likely to be 120mm spaced - you can see them in the 1974 Campagnolo catalog. You're going to have a difficult time finding even old road hubs to fit that spacing. I'm extremely doubtful that you have a 1974 Raleigh International in aluminum, since they were originally built with Reynolds 531 steel and Raleigh didn't list any aluminum frames in their 1974 catalog. A quick test with a magnet should confirm for you. Fundamentally, you're left with a limited number of options for the rear wheel, most of which have been hashed out above: 

The lack of popularity is partially because it's a solution in need of a problem. The effect of rotating mass in general is generally overstated when considering the total energy that goes into cycling, and mass near the axle has even less of an effect. You can work out the math here. The main advantage comes when considering unsprung mass on full-suspension bikes, where having weight on the rider's side of the suspension can improve the handling and response of the bike. This is why inroads have been made in downhill circles. 

For a carbon-fiber disc fork the difference is almost certainly purely aesthetic. Both curved and straight forks will be designed around equivalent rake values, so the direct handling and performance will be identical. The only other difference between curved and straight blades - mostly discussed in terms of standard steel forks - is a minimal amount of shock absorption, and much of the distinction there will be excised by the additional reinforcement required to handle the stresses of a disc brake. 

Does it solidly engage in the cogs on either end of that mis-shift? It sounds plainly to be like a mis-indexed cable. You should be able to shift into that 'barely-not-shifting' position and then loosen the barrel adjuster to cause it to index into place. If that's not happening, your barrel adjuster may have stripped threads. 

With two carriers that are well-spaced I've always put them both forward, with three I put the middle one facing backwards to reduce the amount of interference between adjacent handlebars and porteur racks. For most bike-and-rack combinations it shouldn't matter. 

Given that strategy you should not tension the wheel based on any additional compression from the tire and tube, since getting a flat could result in rim deformation or damage. "The Bicycle Wheel" provides the equation for the decrease in spoke tension under tire constriction, if you're curious. His measurements on a 36-spoke wheel with spokes at roughly 100kgf and a 25mm tire with 45-degree cord at 115psi give a reduction of total wheel compression from about 5700N to about 5300N. In practice you should verify that your spokes decreased in tension evenly; if they didn't you should ensure that you properly stress relieve the spokes and retension them. 

Headset type. Not truly a measurement, but there are two types of headsets - threaded and threadless. The photo you show is of a bike with a threadless headset; the fork's steerer tube will be a smooth, unthreaded tube and the headset is tensioned with a bolt from the top and the clamping action of the stem. Steerer tube diameter. Also two main options, 1" (25.4mm) and 1 1/8" (28.6mm, also known as 1.125" or 9/8"). Nearly all threadless headsets use 1 1/8" steerers. You can verify that the frame you have is for that size by measuring the inside of the head tube, it should be 34mm. If you already have a headset installed, you can verify that the inner diameter of that is 28.6mm. Steerer tube length. If you are purchasing a new (or "uncut") fork this is extremely unlikely to be an issue, but on a used fork you'll need to check. The steerer tube needs to be long enough to extend above the top of the headset with room for the stem to clamp fully. Too short and it can't be used with that frame. Too long isn't an issue, since you can easily use spacers and/or cut it to length. If you measure your stem clamp, your headset, and the length of your head tube and add a few mm for a safe margin you've got a bare minimum steerer length you'll need. Wheel size and brake type. The bike in the picture has 26" (559) wheels and is designed for cantilever or v-brakes. The position of those brake mounts is specific to the wheel diameter, so you'll want to make sure it's for the right size wheels. If you switch to disc brakes, you can omit this concern, but not entirely, because of... Axle-to-crown length. This is the distance from the center of the axle to the top of the fork crown, just below where the steerer tube starts. The frame's geometry was designed around a certain distance here, and changing it dramatically will alter the handling by increasing or decreasing the angles relative to the ground. For mountain bike forks this information is more difficult to come by than for road bike forks, but if your bicycle originally had a suspension fork the rule of thumb for rigid is to find a fork that is "suspension corrected" for the amount of travel your bike originally sold with. In the case of the Scott Tocana it looks like most models shipped with an 80mm suspension fork, so an 80mm suspension-corrected rigid fork should keep things normal.
