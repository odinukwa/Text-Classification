The point is that by working in $V[G]$, we can treat $H_\lambda[G]$ as an ordinary set model and carry out the argument that $N[G] \prec H_\lambda[G]$ within the language of set theory in $V[G]$, rather than as a meta-mathematical scheme. 

Adrian Mathias has been working on forcing over models of a weak fragment of set theory, of which he says: 

Are the following mutually consistent (relative to large cardinals)? (1) There are no $\omega_2$-Aronszajn trees. (2) There is an $\omega_1$-Kurepa tree. In the models I know of the tree property at $\omega_2$, it also holds that there are no weak Kurepa trees on $\omega_1$ (also called Canadian trees). 

Most likely the author is referring to the following fact: The Reflection Scheme proves each instance of the following scheme: Let $\Delta$ be a finite subset of the axioms of ZF. ZF proves that there is a transitive set which is a model of $\Delta$. Let $\tau$ be a constant symbol, and assume ZF is consistent. By the compactness theorem, there is a model of the following set of sentences: ZF $\cup$ $\bigcup$ { $\tau$ is a transitive model of $\Delta$ : $\Delta$ is a finite subset of ZF }. Note that $\tau$ is asserted to be a transitive model of ZF via a scheme. The single statement that there exists a transitive model of ZF has (much) greater consistency strength than CON(ZF), by considerations having to do with Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, plus absoluteness of arithmetical statements for transitive models. 

First, your notation is nonstandard; when we write $\mathrm{Col}(\kappa,\lambda)$, this typically means the set of partial functions $p : \kappa \to \lambda$ of size $<\kappa$, i.e. reverse of yours. First note the following fact: 

This is not meant to be a fully convincing answer, but to argue for one possible way that pure mathematics research is important. I believe that mathematics has some special features that make it good for promoting international cooperation and friendship, building bonds between diverse peoples. First, as is clear to us who do it, pure mathematics is interesting all on its own. One manifestation of this is that it doesn't seem to depend on cultural background or political ideology whether the ideas in mathematics are found to be interesting by a sufficiently curious mind. The same ideas can be appreciated regardless of one's overall perspective. Second, mathematics is (pretty much) objective. One can recognize the value of a mathematician's contribution, and if one has the bare minimum of honesty, it will trump all other prejudgements about the other party. In this way, it has the ability to break through prejudice or adversarial political commitments, without first requiring subjective emotional change to get started. Third, mathematics only requires time and thought. In modern times, once mathematicians with close interests are introduced, collaboration can begin easily and will not necessarily require costly investments by governments or others to get going, in contrast to experimental science. Of course, all the pure intellectual pursuits of mankind are valuable in themselves. But mathematics, though practiced by a small number of us, seems to have a special ability to transcend cultural barriers and perhaps thus contribute in some small way to peace. 

Jech, Thomas J. Some combinatorial problems concerning uncountable cardinals. Ann. Math. Logic 5 (1972/73), 165–198. Section 5 contains the forcing for arbitrarily big Suslin algebras. See also: Scharfenberger-Fabian, Gido Chain homogeneous Souslin algebras. (English summary) MLQ Math. Log. Q. 57 (2011), no. 6, 591–610. According to Gido, his paper, Jech's, and Jensen's result mentioned by Dorais are the only known contsructions of "big" Suslin algebras. Jech's forcing is thus the only thing that makes one bigger than $\aleph_2$. Note that Jech does not explicitly prove distributivity in his paper, but it is not hard to show given what is there. 

Is it consistent to have (at the same time) a real-valued measurable cardinal and precipitous ideals on small cardinals such as $\omega_1$? What about saturated ideals on small cardinals? 

Update: I think I have a partial answer to Question 2. Supercompactness is indeed overkill, and weak compactness is enough after all. Let $\kappa$ be weakly compact, and $P$ be $\kappa$-c.c. Let $\theta > \kappa$ be regular such that $P \in H_\theta$. Let $\tau$ be any $P$-name for a $<\kappa$ sized set of ordinals. Let $M \prec H_\theta$ be such that $P,\tau \in M$, $|M| \leq \kappa$, and $M^{<\kappa} \subseteq M$. This is possible just because $\kappa$ is inaccessible. Then $P \cap M$ is a regular suborder of $P$, since all antichains contained in $P \cap M$ are members of $M$, and $M$ knows which ones are maximal. By the Fact, there is $Q \lhd P \cap M \lhd P$ and a $Q$-name $\sigma$ such that $|Q| < \kappa$ and $\Vdash_{P \cap M} \tau = \sigma$. 

Suppose $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal. Does there necessarily exist a poset $\mathbb P$ that collapses $\kappa^+$ while preserving all other cardinals? 

I have a history question for which I've had trouble finding a good answer. The common story about nonmeasurable sets is that Vitali showed that one existed using the Axiom of Choice, and Lebesgue et al. put the blame squarely on this axiom and its non-constructive character. It was noticed however that some amount of choice was required to get measure theory off the ground, namely Dependent Choice seemed to be the principle typically employed. But the full axiom of choice which allows uncountably many arbitrary choices to be made is of a different character, and is the culprit behind the pathological sets. This viewpoint was not really justified until Solovay showed in the 1960s that ZF+DC could not prove the existence of a nonmeasurable set, assuming the consistency of an inaccessible cardinal. My question is, in the many years before Solovay's theorem, was there any effort aimed at showing the existence of a nonmeasurable set without the use of the full AC? Was something like the following question ever posed or worked on: "Can constructions similar to those of Vitali, Hausdorff, and Banach-Tarski be done without appeal to the Axiom of Choice?" 

Suppose $\kappa$ is $\kappa^{+\omega}$-supercompact. If $U$ is a normal measure on $\mathcal P_\kappa(\kappa^{+\omega})$, and $j : V \to M$ is the derived embedding, then it is easy to see that $j[\mathcal P_\kappa(\kappa^{+\omega})] \in M$, and thus $M$ is closed under $\kappa^{+\omega+1}$-sequences by the cardinal arithmetic. We can then derive a normal measure $U'$ on $\mathcal P_\kappa(\kappa^{+\omega+1})$ by putting $X \in U'$ iff $j[\kappa^{+\omega+1}] \in j(X)$. Let $i : V \to N$ be the ultrapower embedding by $U'$. There is an embedding $k : N \to M$ such that $j = k \circ i$. Define $k([f]) = j(f)(j[\kappa^{+\omega+1}])$. Question 1: Is $k$ the identity? Now let $\pi : \mathcal P_\kappa(\kappa^{+\omega+1}) \to \mathcal P_\kappa(\kappa^{+\omega})$ be $\pi(z) = z \cap \kappa^{+\omega}$. Let $U'' = \{ X \subseteq \mathcal P_\kappa(\kappa^{+\omega}) : \pi^{-1}[X] \in U' \}$. Question 2: Does $U'' = U$? 

I'm going to assume that when you write $\subseteq$, you really mean $\subseteq_{NS}$. We say $A \subseteq_{NS} B$ when $A$ is contained in $B$ except for a nonstationary set, i.e. $A \setminus B \in NS$. If we don't do this, then as Joel said, $\lambda = \kappa$, since the collection of "coatoms" is cofinal. If we take the set of equivalence classes of stationary sets modulo $NS$, (i.e. $A \sim B$ when $A \triangle B \in NS$) we get an atomless boolean algebra under the set operations modulo $NS$, and this is what is commonly meant by $\mathcal{P}(\kappa)/NS$. Now in general an "upwardly dense" subset $A$ of a boolean algebra $B$ ("cofinal" as you call it) generates a (downwardly) dense set by just taking the complement of every element of $A$. Now, it is known to be equiconsistent with infinitely many Woodin cardinals that $NS_{\omega_1}$ is $\omega_1$-dense. But by results of Gitik and Shelah, $\mathcal{P}(\kappa)/NS$ never has the $\kappa^+$-chain condition for regular $\kappa > \omega_1$. Hence the density of this algebra is always greater than $\kappa$. Under GCH, it must be equal to $\kappa^+$. Woodin showed relative to an almost-huge cardinal that it is consistent for a successor cardinal $\kappa > \omega_1$ to have a stationary subset $S$ such that $\mathcal{P}(S)/NS$ has the $\kappa^+$-c.c. (See Foreman's article in Handbook of Set Theory.) I'm pretty sure that the stronger property of being $\kappa$-dense is not known to be consistent from any large cardinal assumption. Under a fragment of GCH, if $\kappa$ is the successor of singular cardinal (for example $\aleph_{\omega+1}$) $NS_\kappa$ is provably not $\kappa$-dense below any stationary set. (This is my result, to appear in my thesis soon.)
