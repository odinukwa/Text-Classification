Mindfulness (read: paying attention) is a vehicle to True Reality (seeing without the influence of kleshas). After this permanent consciousness transformation has occured, the struggle at mindfulness is no longer required as it was during mindfulness training. Someone: Who are you? Are you a god? Buddha: I am Awake. 

Osamu Tezuka's Buddha is really fun manga and fictional account of Buddha's life. Also check out Ikkyu... awesome manga about Zen and sudden realization! Gave me chills when I really put myself into his journey... A good movie that fictionally demonstrates some Buddhist concepts is Cloud Atlas. Samsara is another good one. There are plenty of lists (I've only seen the top three) online. 

Yes, through proper (read Theravadin) Buddhist practice, an intellectual person, curious of many things will unwittingly, effortlessly gain understanding of many things about himself and the universe. He can intentionally direct his prajna wisdom to any subject and understand it completely. This is all I will share/write because there is so much information available. You can research the rest about the different types of prajna wisdom on Bill's meditationexpert.com site and most importantly cultivate mindfulness meditation (samatha) and vipassana. (When you have a question in your mind after stabilizing your mind through meditation, the answer will come--unless you crave the answer too strongly.) 

What helped me tremendously distance myself is this: Contemplate the various advantages and disadvantages of having a girlfriend--particularly the one that you think you would get--not the dream-woman-that-you-have-to-be-on-a-certain-level-you-are-not-at-to-get. For example, here is a personal list of benefits of celibacy: 

The Buddha who knew there were 31 realm but didn't mention anything about a round earth The Buddha always talked about spherical shapes throughout the suttas. Spherical shapes when referring to other worlds and also realms. You may also be confused when it is talked about the eight cardinal directions, confusing it for a flat plane. Instead the saying "anything in the eight cardinal directions" refers to the entire unvierse outside of yourself. Also, according to this blog entry he describes the earth very perfectly including its radius. Also, in the Surangama sutra or some other sutra Buddha describes the roundness of planets and "sun-systems." I can look for the exact source but try googling it and comment back first. 

I agree with dean's harsh but canonical answer. Animal's do not possess the intelligence necessary to create enough understanding of Dharma to Awaken. They also have other obstacles such as being uncomfortable, emotionally bonded to tribe, etc. If an animal does manage to reach a high level of cultivation in its life (very rare) then it tends to die on the spot (source: an old story about a monk who's cow Awakened and fell dead and he went looking for the human incarnation of the cow). is there a way to benefit animals by helping them come into contact with the Dhamma? Definitely! 

... I think of how long-lived such mountain monks tended to be on such a minimal diet (and of course whatever spiritual cultivation they gained) and focused they were on their own cultivation. Are there any records of diets of these mountain monks? I know many of them practiced Taoist teachings in addition to core Buddhist teachings, like the many monks that wrote the poems on Cold Mountain. 

If you're talking about a God which is not a being but the cause of all causes then yes that God is the same as our True Nature or Buddha Nature as Buddha called it. If you're talking about a God which created worlds, galaxies, etc. then that is simply just a God in the form realm or the higher Desire realm heaven. (See Thirty-One Planes of Existence.) If you're talking about one specific being created this entire universe (and all multiverses) including its countless solar systems within countless galaxies... then (1) you need to look at some astronomy videos and (2) the The Buddha specifically says that specific Gods (from the Form and Desire realm heavens) that delight in creation created particular galaxies/places and no one God created every single thing. He also says that excessive speculation will only waste your time and distract from the actual issue: unhappiness and being trapped in birth-and-death. Is it more important to be find True Happiness (free of conditions like having physical pleasure, the right relationship, enough money, etc.) and be able to decide where you go in the universe or is it more important to spend your life intellectually understand the origin of the universe? The Buddha emphasized the former and said that the latter would take too long to explain (although he did a good job with the 31 Planes of Existence). 

First, if I may, I will correct one misunderstanding: Enlightenment = free from rebirth =/= not no MORE rebirth... Enlightenment means one will not be bounded on the wheel of destiny--rather one will be able to help others freely. Thus, do not equate Enlightenment with totally never being born. It's beyond born and unborn. To answer your question: The latter is correct: all beings are destined to attain Enlightenment eventually. The Mahayana sutras state how people will all be saved at some time or another, specifically Maitreya Buddha who, when he returns, will deliver "billions" of beings at a time through the universe. (Surangama Sutra) Here is more info on this Buddha: 

The above answer is partly right. Going into someone else's limited perspective and feeling compassion for them is good but how often can you do this? There are negative people abound. A shortcut: Don't try to understand the other person's perspective too much. The more you try to understand their perspective the more you will believe it! Stay away from such people or at least when they become like that. Stay in your mind. Find reasons for why you WILL succeed. ACT. See yourself succeeding (in your mind and especially in reality). IMAGINE IT. ACTUALLY DO IT. ACTUALLY SUCCEED, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. Don't care what others think. Doubt your doubts. You do not know what they are truly thinking. You never can! Even if you ask them, they may say one thing but in their hearts believe another thing. For example, the person who is jealous of you will tell you that you will fail but is in fact strongly believes in you but cannot ever admit it verbally. Another example: teenage life these days where a person will make fun of you to try to "make you stronger" or "get you to prove them wrong". They actually love you and want to help but have too much ego. They want to save face so they give you negative attention instead. The silliness is endless! STAY IN YOUR OWN HEAD. Empathize and move on. You are your first friend so own up to your thinking. Give yourself metta, mudita, karuna, upekkha. Give the same to others. But DO NOT LET OTHERS STEP ON YOU psychicly or emotionally otherwise you will never be able to help many people but will be trapped in a cycle of hate and resentment! Basic tips? (I face the same thing you are facing x3) 

It is actually the cycle of dukkha/afflictions that is stopped (initially). The interesting thing that should motivate everyone to work towards enlightenment is this: it is due to these afflictions/dukkha that we are forced to take on certain rebirths--as punishment/reward for our action... even the smallest action. Also, nothing is actually "stopped"... There is no end to the Buddhist quest, not even Buddahood! As a Buddha one still takes on rebirths but now these are intentional rebirths! One intends to be reborn in such and such place and such and such place in order to accomplish Compassionate Action 924,322,322... That is a Buddha's existence. Being perfectly at ease with the universe, free from dukkha and forced rebirth, emanating only to complete their vow to help all beings and solve the universe's karma -- one of the many reasons that they have such power in the first place! Buddhism places no strict timeline and potentially one can become a Buddha anytime (because one is fundamentally so). (Although this is like saying one can definitely win the lottery any time.) 

Buddha is a title for any being who after much compassionate work as a bodhisattva, achieves Buddahood. (This begs the important, approachable question what is a bodhisattva? Not meant to be asked, but researched.) A Buddha does not enter Nirvana until all beings are saved. The original Buddha of our little planet Earth was Shakyamuni Buddha, male inheritor of the Shakya kingdom. He was also known as Gautama, especially by the Hindus. 

Excellent line of inquiry. Just as you have proved, it takes a long time, sometimes thousands and millions of rebirths as a lower life forms to accumulate said merit. On the other hand, demigods can ruin or greatly increase their stores of merit (because their power is that much higher). A demigod can sink direectly into the deepest states of hell. Some demigods die even if they miss one meal. Human incarnation is in the middle and has all the advantages the lower and higher incarnations do not have. Everything I have said here is in the suttas and all Buddhist texts agree. 

Vipassana itself is True Awareness, clear-seeing presence in the moment absent of wandering thoughts. There is no Awakening without some success in Vipassana practice. Continued Vipassana practice aka True Awareness, results in Complete Enlightenment. Buddhism is really that simple and that's why the Buddha said "Mindfulness is liberation"! Satipatthana is merely a pathway (or meditation method) for Vipassana training. Another pathway would be Anapanasati (breathing meditation). These are the two best paths and have sutras and many commentaries worth reading explaining how to construct that pathway. In reality though all paths are the same and you will understand this after developing fluency over how to practice various meditation methods. 

notice your level of anxiety (and other hindrances) and use mindfulness to bring yourself back to present moment especially by breaking down automatic actions (break down the noticing to building blocks e.g. typing W-O-R-D, moving mouse left quickly, left-up slow, up slow) notice when switching from one thing to another but don't get in the way of that switching by interpreting this meditation itself... just observe yourself accomplishing such things effortlessly! practice self-awareness meditation for this (also called cessation-contemplation). This can decrease your overall panic-level while working on projects and also help you stay off sites like 9gag and other distractions. One should use a similar method as when one does mindfulness while eating and walking when it is noticed. Forcing oneself to notice everything is a type of anxiety and can be noted as well, vipassana style. 

Buddha (and other masters) tend to depart from this life--or into the other boundless jhanas from the 4th jhana. This is because the 1st three jhanas are "tainted" with certain attachments to bliss, joy, and pleasure. 

Mindfulness isn't about self-diagnosis but it can easily lead to self-criticism if one isn't careful. It is about being present and objectively being aware of what it is without judgment. This is rarely a bad thing. Even if you are out partying, you can be mindful of your wacky dance moves and so long as you do this correctly (without judgment) it will not necessarily interfere with your ability to have a good time. Even with the most worldly examples, everything is in its right place when mindfulness is practiced correctly: making love, playing video games, eating, etc. It can be nice to stop even in the midst of enjoyment to be detachedly mindful... it often produces great insights. Moresoover, the non-worldly activities are helped through mindfulness as well. The problem is when people use mindfulness to stack thoughts on top of thoughts due to self-judgment. Mindfulness is not about that. If one enters a state where one cannot stop one's thoughts and one cannot calm oneself, one should practice samatha not vipassana (mindfulness)... or just try to force oneself to go to sleep. Proper mindfulness always leads to an effective course of action but one should always hold more important an attitude of self-acceptance and non-attachment as the heart of mindfulness. 

THe most successful cultivators and Buddhists cultivated in the forest or mountains where there are few people. In our day and age, this is less easy due to polluted rivers, overharvesting of resources, financial necessity, etc. and we all live in noisy metropolises. 

No but the concept of dharmakaya in Theravada is known as dhammakaya. The ideas of sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya (rupakaya) on the other hand were not developed fully until Mahayana entered the picture. According to the same Wikipedia entry, it is possible the idea of some form of rupa-kaya was taking shape though as this passage (section 9) from the Aggañña Sutta may indicate: 

Above all, Buddhists teach not to obstruct one's own emotion... rather to accept and observe it. So don't let the idea of what an Arhat (a real Buddhist) would do to obstruct your own heart because if one does so... it will create even more karma. The behavior of a Buddha is not merely emulated but is the product of moral discipline, meditation, contemplation, and concentration. Merely copying a Buddha's results will only result in frustration--not being more Buddhist or closer to the goal. Now, to answer your question: a real Buddhist aka an Arhat on his way to Buddahood, does not fall in love. They simply cannot generate such a tremendous amount of ignorance and greed. They may still develop an appreciation for someone, a preference for someone but they do not develop the romantic obsession known commonly as love. As for a practicing Buddhist... depending on what their goal is, be it Enlightenment in this very lifetime or just enough merit to improve their current life and be reborn in a better place, the answer is different. Obviously, romantic life is frequently a waste of time and a cause of suffering and bad karma. A marriage of purpose and unity is far superior compared to "falling in love." Anyway, if "falling in love", an unfortunate phenomenon, does happen to oneself, it is best not to repress it or exaggerate it but rather one should go along with it and use it as a metta meditation and eventually integrating upekkha meditation into it, all the while creating as few of The Three Poisons as one can (via naturally avoiding craving), maintaining one's practice. 

You don't have to believe in rebirth. Rebirth concept in Buddhism is not as simple as simple as reincarnation anyway. It's actually better if you don't hold any blind beliefs in Buddhism since it is a find-out-for-yourself kind of religion, i.e. when you reach the proper stage you will have the insights. It all starts from working on the trainings for morality, concentration and insight. 

Because you have not dissolved the Hindrances, Afflictions, and not attained Awakening. These fires are active in all people. Instead of taking the restrictive and simpler path: the Theravadin path of becoming a monastic.... most of us have to choose to take the Mahayana path--the path of attaining Awakening within the world of Samsara which has become more complex in nature. This is the path of Bodhisattva and produces a superior class of Enlightened beings as compared to the Theravadin path whereby such people cannot keep their peace within the world. But unfortunately, in some ways this path is harder than ever (more desires).... In other ways this path is easier now than ever (technology, facilities, conveniences, GTD). Keep practicing and learn to not add attention/energy to fires. 

Basically: whenever you're ready for it. Solitude is a human right. Technical Buddhist answer: when you have achieved >= "access concentration", preferably 1st jhana, optimally 4th jhana. Also you should know what what you're going to be doing (vipassana/jhana, how long, etc. read schedule). If you don't have at least access concentration, you'll just flounder in emotions and what-not until you get access concentration. It's a catch-22. 

Sometimes being mindful can get in the way of learning--sometimes it can support it (for example, catching yourself when you are just drolling through the read not understanding anything). You will have to learn things the "ordinary" non-mindful way until you understand what mindfulness feels like. So don't worry, just keep reading and learning about it, absorbing the right Buddhist material on your way to Right Mindfulness. Eventually, when you have become used to mindfulness and you try to read, you will naturally be one-pointed and focused, as you go through a reading. Your target will be: your purpose for reading. Your distractions that you will learn to be aware of and transcend (be mindful of): distraction, self-doubt, expectation, etc. You will be aware of the things in the distraction category and make the one-pointed target (ekagatta) the sun around which your actions revolve. Until you reach this foundation of mindfulness, don't try to do two things at one time. You will only be creating more anxiety and false expectation--at least until you are familiar with mindfulness and have an overall more clear state of mind. Thus, the answer to your question is: meditate more and get stronger in mindfulness before trying to carry your power in the midst of activity. Doing the latter is always more difficult and needs a good foundation in the former. If you cannot do the latter, you need more foundation in the former. Use this as a rule of thumb for all activities you want to include into meditation. I hope this helps, writing this helped me to answer a question I had before, haha.
