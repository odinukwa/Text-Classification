In both cases we tend to use concrete objects and drawings. But these are only practical aids, not the real mathematical objects. The multiple imperfect triangles on the blackboard stand for multiple perfect, exact, pure triangles. The source is Plato's Analogy of the Divided Line in the Republic through which he presented four different kinds of objects, corresponding to four different kinds of knowledge. Here is an excerpt where Plato relates to the mathematical objects: 

Zeno is known not only for Achilles and the Tortoise. He is said to have written a book, but the book hasn't survived (or hasn't been discovered). We know about nine of his paradoxes from Aristotle's Physics. Among them the Dichotomy, the Arrow, the Stadium. The Arrow argues that when an arrow is shot, at each moment it occupies some place. Therefore, at each moment the arrow is at rest in that place. Therefore, the arrow does not move. For nothing can move and rest at the same time. The Arrow is, then, an argument against the reality of movement. It pictures every moment as independent of the others. The Achilles paradox, on the other hand, is not merely against the actuality of movement. Even if we accept that each moment is independent of the others, we still face the Achilles problem: Achilles cannot pass the tortoise, but we see that he does. Therefore what we see is an illusion. And what do we, in general, see? The Achilles seems to be an argument against the reality of time, not merely in the sense of change and movement, but more generally as a static manifold, as a plurality. We are supposed to conclude that time, as we know it, does not exist, not only in the sense of movement and change, but in the sense of a genuine manifold, of a genuine plurality. 

"Speculative Realism" seems to be a kind of late reaction against Kant. It uses "speculative" in Kant's sense (overstepping the limits of possible experience) but with an opposite, positive evaluation. It is a kind of return to pre Kantian metaphysics. 

Plato discusses mathematical objects in the analogy of the divided line, at book 6 of the Republic. What the analogy indicates, I will argue, is that mathematical objects are not genuine entities in Plato's ontology. Only the Forms (Ideas) are genuine entities in Plato's ontology. Mathematical thinking is indeed said to require much purer reflection on the Forms, compared to thinking about material objects (*). Still, mathematical thinking is not a reflection on abstract mathematical entities, according to Plato (**). The divided line expresses of the following classification of objects: 

Do we have evidence that Aristotle had certain correct insights to believe that gravity is different from the other "forces"? Well, what else could he think? That is, what other enduring, permanent physical forces are there, anyway? In modern terms, there are just four fundamental physical forces: gravity, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, weak nuclear. Of these, Aristotle could have been familiar only with gravity. The other three fundamental forces were unfamiliar to Aristotle (I don't know whether he was familiar with phenomena of magnetism and / or static electricity). Aristotle also rejected the contemporary atomic theory, which was probably closer to modern physics than Aristotle's. Those three other fundamental physical forces were not discovered for another 2000 years. Additionally, beside the downward movement, which today we identity as gravity, Aristotle also believed that the upward movement of fire and hot air was also a fundamental natural movement. Today we view the upward movement as more complex, less fundamental than the downward movement. The upward movement involves air density and air pressure, in addition to an indirect influence of gravity (colder air sinking downwards). 

This may be a delicate question. On the one hand, Plato's Socrates asserts, in the Phaedo, concerning the misanthropist (hater of people), that only few people are genuinely good or evil. 

Russell's idea in "on the nature of truth" (1906) seems to be, to escape the Liar paradox through the rather colorful suggestion, that there is no such thing as a false belief. In ordinary language we do recognize, of course, false beliefs. Russell's suggestion is that on reality, "behind" ordinary language, there are no false beliefs. What we ordinarily call false belief is, in reality, a belief in nothing. 

In Ethics 1098, which you mention in the question, although Aristotle does not use the phrase "rational animal", in effect he does define Man (i.e. human being) there, as rational animal. What Aristotle is asking there is what is Man's characteristic "work" (action, activity) as Man. It is not nutrition or growth, because these are common to all plants. It is not perception or movement, because these are common to all animals. What remains, according to Aristotle, is the rational life, life according to "the rational nature". So Man's genus is animal, and its characteristic difference is rationality, therefore it follows that Man's definition is rational animal. 

I would suggest to use the expression research program, and to just drop the word metaphysical. Popper himself used the expression in this way sometimes, as can be seen in two passages that are quoted in the Wikipedia article on him: 

The thing is, that for the early Wittgenstein the Cogito Ergo Sum was just not true. So the Cogito could not be true a priori for him. Like David Hume, Wittgenstein believed that the Cartesian Ego, the thinking subject, was nowhere to be found. 

Conserving motion is part of God's preserving the world (which may indicate that the world would not exist if motion were not conserved). 

Therefore, materialism and determinism go hand in hand, not because they inherently imply each other, but because one of them (determinism) is implied by the motivation and by the justification of the other (materialism). The deviation of QM from strict determinism is a source of embarrassment to the determinist. Yet, several factors lessen this embarrassment. First, those deviations from determinism are limited and circumscribed. Second, the deviations not seem related to anything resembling free will. Third, computationally speaking, QM is the most "deterministic" material theory to date, in the sense that it provides the most precise predictions. 

concrete objects 1.1 material objects 1.2 visual shadows and reflections abstract objects 2.1 the Forms = Ideas 2.2 mathematical objects 

No, this does not seem to be implied. Consider the following analogy. I try to open my flat door, not by using a key, but by chanting "Open Sesame". Surprisingly, the door does not open! Does this imply that there is a force, or an external being, preventing the door from opening? Well, hardly. Rather, it implies that chanting is powerless, and therefore no force or external being is needed to prevent its effect. Similarly, the fact that X does not come into being by being defined to exist, does not imply that there is a force or being external to logic preventing it from existing. What it does imply is that defining something to exist is powerless to actually cause it to exist, to come into being. And therefore no force or external being is required, to prevent it from happening. 

In other words, we'd better not reify states, if we don't have to. Syntactically, we can still treat states as pseudo-entities using transformation rules, such as: alive(x) <-> (Es)alive(s,x) We seem to need reified events, more than we need reified states. Davidson's main reason for that, if I recall correctly, is that events are needed as the terms of causal relations. There seems to be no similar motive for reified states, because states are not ingredients of causal relations (at least in Davidson's account of causality ).
