Misha's answer provides examples (for certain $n$), of pairs of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (both with the standard smooth structure), that are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to each other, thus giving a partial answer to the more general question 2). One of the open sets is built from an exotic $(n−2)$-dimensional sphere which can be realized as Brieskorn variety. Smoothly embedding in $\mathbb{R}^n$, it can be viewed as a "small exotic $\mathbb{S}^{n-2}\times\mathbb{R}^2$" Meanwhile, I got the following partial answer from an expert (private communication; as above, dimension $4$ is excluded). It goes in the other sense, providing examples of large exotic structures on open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ (again, not for all $n>4$): "Strictly speaking, $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus 0$ answers your question for most values of $n$, since it is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\times\mathbb{R}$, and the first factor typically has exotic structures that remain nondiffeomorphic to the original after product with $\mathbb{R}$. However, the resulting exotic structures do not embed in $\mathbb{R}^n$. I am guessing that you want pairs of open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that are homeomorphic to each other but not diffeomorphic. I don't know if such pairs exist. Clearly, they would have to have trivial tangent bundles, but that does not preclude exoticness: there are exotic spheres $S$ that bound parallelizable manifolds, so $S\times\mathbb{R}$ has a trivial tangent bundle and is not diffeomorphic to a standard sphere $\times\mathbb{R}$. However, such an example cannot embed as an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$. (Otherwise, $S$ would bound a ball and hence be standard.)" Two short comments: 1) this construction provides examples of manifolds homeomorphic to simple open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$, but which do not smoothly embed in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (summing up, an exotic structure in the $(n-1)$-sphere gives rise to an exotic structure on the punctured $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is "large" in the sense that it does not embed smoothly in $\mathbb{R}^n$). 2) It would be also interesting to know analogue (topologically) simple examples in every dimension $n>4$ for which the $(n-1)$-sphere exhibits no exotic structure (in the case $n=5$, for which no exotic structure is known). 

Kummer, in the 1850s, proved the p-th power reciprocity laws for regular primes. He conjectured that his formulation was valid for arbitrary primes, but the only one who mentioned this conjecture and hinted at a way of solving it was his student and friend Kronecker. Only when Hilbert, at the end of the 1890s, proved a quadratic reciprocity law in number fields with even class number did it become clear what to do, and within the next 15 years Furtwängler followed Hilbert's path and proved the full p-th power reciprocity law. These results didn't appeal to many mathematicians, and only when Artin found a way of formulating the reciprocity law in a conceptual way did it become a widely known and widely used result. Certainly one reason why Kummer's conjecture was largely neglected was that the techniques for solving the problem were lacking. In addition, a lot of people probably did not think it was interesting because the problem could not be put into some conceptual framework since Frobenius published his results on the Frobenius automorphism at about the same time Hilbert was working on these problems. 

In general, the first digit of a number $A$ can be determined from the fractional part of $\log_{10} A$. Specifically, if $\log_{10} A = n + \gamma$ where $n = \lfloor \log_{10} A \rfloor$ and $\gamma = \{ \log_{10} A \}$ then $A = 10^\gamma 10^n$ and $1 \leq 10^\gamma < 10$. Therefore the first decimal digit of $A$ is $k$ iff $k \leq 10^\gamma < k+1$, or, equivalently, iff $\log_{10} k \leq \gamma < \log_{10} (k+1)$. Taking the special case where $A = G$ is Graham's number, we have $G = 3^{3^x}$ for some natural number $x$. Then $\log_{10} G = 3^x \log_{10} 3$. Observe that multiplication by $3^x$ is the same as shifting the base 3 digits of a number $x$ places to the left. Setting $\alpha = \log_{10} 3$ the problem reduces to finding the base 3 digits of $\alpha$ starting $x$ places after the decimal point. Then the following conjecture would imply that it is impossible to prove anything about the first digit of $G$ in time $o (x)$: Conjecture: Given a natural number $x$ and a sequence of base 3 digits $z_0, \dots, z_{k-1}$, any proof in ZFC of the statement "The first $k$ base 3 digits of $\alpha$ starting $x$ places after the decimal point are not $z_0 \dots z_{k-1}$" must have length $\Omega\:(n)$. Analogous conjectures can be asked for any other $b \geq 2$ and replacing $\alpha = \log_{10} 3$ with any other well-known irrational numbers. The reason to expect such a conjecture to hold is that I don't think there is any way to prove anything about $x$th digit of $\alpha$ that is essentially different from calculating the $x$th digit with a general-purpose algorithm, and I don't think there are any such sublinear general-purpose algorithms. Given that there does exist a quasilinear time algorithm for computing the digits of $\alpha$ (see Modern Computer Arithmetic for details), this conjecture would give a fairly sharp estimates $\tilde {\Theta}\:(\log \log G)$ steps for the shortest proof determining the first digit of $G$. Showing that there are no sublinear-time algorithms for computing the $x$th digits of any natural irrational number seems more difficult than the P vs. NP problem, which is already far beyond what current theoretic computer science can achieve, and the conjecture I stated above is probably more difficult still. However, if we ever get to the point where it is possible to give sharp lower bounds on the most efficient possible algorithms for most problems, then this problem would be potentially solvable. 

defined the "Führer" of an order in a number field. [BTW: in German, Führer does not actually mean a strong leader but rather someone who guides you (as in tourist guide). But of course . . . ] Class groups of orders in quadratic number fields are ring class groups, which generalize immediately to ray class groups (Weber); from there the word spread to complex multiplication and class field theory. 

If $L/K$ is abelian and $K/k$ cyclic, then $L/k$ is going to be normal if the Galois group at the gottom acts on the class group attached to $L/K$ via class field theory, and it will be abelian if action fixes the classes. This is due to Hasse and follows easily from the standard results in class field theory. This is Prop. 1.2.8 in my survey on class field towers (I apologize for the outdated content. All of this needs to be rewritten). There are similar constructions in Kummer theory going back to Kummer; this can be used in several proofs of the Kronecker-Weber theorem and should be e.g. in Washington's book; see also Prop. 2.2.1 in the survey If the base extension is abelian and not cyclic, stuff happens. There are many articles investigating this problem, but nothing as simple as in the cyclic case. 

Are there any filmed lectures by outstanding German mathematician Jürgen Moser (July 4, 1928 – December 17, 1999)? 

Are there any filmed lectures by outstanding American mathematician Hassler Whitney, besides the two Einstein Chair lectures below? Old lectures, from the 1940s onwards, would be particularly interesting. $URL$ $URL$ 

Question: What are the currently known best provable and unconditional lower and upper bounds for Brun's constant $B$, corresponding to the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes? Remark. According to Dominic Klyve's thesis "Explicit bounds on twin primes and Brun's Constant" (2007, p.23) the best provable unconditional bounds known at the time were given by $1,830484424658 < B < 2,347$ the lower bound being obtained by computation of the sum up to $10^{16}$. Hence, apparently, not even the first digit was known at the time i.e. the question $B<2$ was open. Was there any significant progress since then? Note that the finner estimates that one usually sees, as that of Nicely $B=1.90216 05823 +/- 0.00000 00008$ are in fact conjectured but not rigorously proved (95% "confidence interval" according to its author). 

One out of the almost endless supply of identities discovered by Ramanujan is the following: $$ \sqrt[3]{\sqrt[3]{2}-1} = \sqrt[3]{\frac19} - \sqrt[3]{\frac29} + \sqrt[3]{\frac49}, $$ which has the following interpretation in algebraic number theory: the fundamental unit $\sqrt[3]{2}-1$ of the pure cubic number field $K = {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})$ becomes a cube in the extension $L = K(\sqrt[3]{3})$. Are there more examples of this kind in Ramanujan's work? 

If $N \varepsilon = -1$, then the ideals $(2b_i + \sqrt{m},a_i)$ represent the different ideal classes of order dividing $2$ (I am using equivalence in the usual (wide) sense), and each such ideal class is represented exactly once in this way. Moreover, each ideal is equivalent to exactly one ramified ideal (i.e. a product of distinct ramified prime ideals). If $N \varepsilon = +1$, then the ideals $(2b_i + \sqrt{m},a_i)$ represent exactly those ideal classes of order $2$ that are not represented by a ramified ideal, and each ideal has two such representations. 

(Note: I'm not actually familiar with $S^1_2$ and the related formalism, but I'm going by your description of the theory, and I have been already thinking about related questions in an informal way.) Here are two true number-theoretical statements of the form $\forall n. \varphi (n)$ that don't have any obvious proofs in $S_2^1$: 

We've reduced the problem of checking proof validity to the following reference-checking problem: Given an array $x_0, \dots, x_{n-1}$ of $\ell$-bit values and a list $(k_0, y_0), (k_1, y_1), \dots, (k_{m-1}, y_{m-1})$ where each $k_j$ has $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ bits and each $y_j$ has $\ell$ bits, check that $x_{k_j} = y_j$ for all $j < m$. I claim that this can be done with $\tilde {O} ((n + m) \ell)$ additional variables and constraints. First of all, we may append $(0, x_0), (1, x_1), \dots, (n-1, x_{n-1})$ to the list $((k_j, y_j))$. Therefore we may assume without loss of generality that $m \geq n$ and $(k_i, y_i) = (i, x_i)$ for $i < n$. Moreover, it is sufficient to check that $((k_i, y_i))$ is self-consistent: That if $k_i = k_j$ then $y_i = y_j$. This is checked by sorting $((k_i, y_i))$: Let $(\tilde {k}_0, \tilde {y}_0), \dots, (\tilde {k}_{m-1}, \tilde {y}_{m-1})$ be a permutation of $(k_0, y_0), \dots, (k_{m-1}, y_{m-1})$ with $\tilde {k}_0 \leq \tilde {k}_1 \leq \dots \leq \tilde {k}_{m-1}$ (this is checkable in $\tilde {O} (m \ell)$ variables and constraints). Then it suffices to check the that if $\tilde {k}_{i+1} = \tilde {k}_i$ then $\tilde {y}_{i+1} = \tilde {y}_i$. This requires $O (m (\ell + \log n))$ bits and constraints. 

In a handwritten note on the reprint he sent to Gauss he remarked that $\sum 1/\log n$ (this is Gauss's version of the PNT, at least if you replace the sum by an integral) is a better estimate than Legendre's. I am a little bit puzzled as to why Dirichlet's claim to have proved the prime number theorem is not discussed anywhere in the literature. Or is it? 

Assume that $O_K$ is Euclidean. The Motzkin Sets $_j$ are defined by $E_0 = \{0\}$, $E_1 = E_0 \cup O_K^\times$, $E_2$ is the set of elements of $O_K$ such that each residue class is represented by an element in $E_1$ etc. $O_K$ is Euclidean if every element of $O_K$ is in some $E_i$ (see Sect. 2.3 here). Since $E_1$ has $3$ elements, $O_K$ must have an element of norm $\le 3$, which implies that the discriminant of $K$ is $\ge -11$. All these rings are norm-Euclidean, and the converse is trivial. This is classical and has nothing to do with the solution of the class number $1$ problem. 

Baker's theorem implies that $$ |\log (A/B)| = |\sum e_i \log p_i - \sum f_j \log q_j| > \max (e_i, f_j)^{-C} $$ where $C$ depends only on $\{p_i\}, \{q_j\}$. Since $A \leq \left( \prod p_i \right) ^{\max (e_i)}$ and $B \leq \left( \prod q_j \right) ^{\max (f_j)}$ it follows that $\max (e_i, f_j) \sim \log (\max (A, B))$. Assume for convenience that $A > B$. Then $$ A/B - 1 \geq \log (A/B) \gtrsim \log (A)^{-C} $$ It follows that $|A - B| \gtrsim \log (A)^{-C} A \gtrsim A^{1-\epsilon}$ for all $\epsilon > 0$. Picking $\epsilon < 1 - d$ we get $|A - B| > A^d$ for sufficiently large $A$. 

In type theory, the notation $(x : A) \to B (x)$ instead of $\Pi_{x : A} B (x)$ for the dependent product and $(x : A) \times B (x)$ instead of $\Sigma _{x : A} B (x)$ for the dependent sum. For non-type-theorists, a dependent product is a set-indexed product of a collection of sets, and a dependent sum is a set-indexed disjoint union of a collection of sets[1]. The former notation is used in the Agda, the latter is less widely spread but both are used for example in cubicaltt. Some advantages of this notation are: 

p. 324: This investigation on the real and ideal complex numbers is completly identical to the classification of certain related forms of degree $\lambda-1$ in $\lambda-1$ variables, of which Dirichlet has found but not yet published the main results. p. 325: I have so far not yet studied this area of the theory of complex numbers in depth; in particular I have not yet worked out the determination of the true number of classes since I have heard by word of mouth that Dirichlet, using principles similar to those in his famous memoirs on quadratic forms, has already found this number. 

Numbers with this property belong to the set of normal numbers. All known normal numbers are "constructed"; it is not known whether a single "natural" number (square roots of nonsquares, pi, e, logarithms of integers $> 1$) is normal or not. It is believed, however, that these numbers are in fact normal (even independently from the chosen base), and thus have the desired property.
