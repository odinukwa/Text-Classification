The bayonet was introduced in the late 17th century as a knife (later a short sword) attached to a musket, to enable the musketeer to protect himself when reloading their single-shot weapons. As such, it was something of an "adjunct" weapon to the gun itself. $URL$ Anti-cavalry tactics in the late 18th, early 19th century often consisted of musketeers with bayonets "forming square" to resist cavalry charges. These resistances often succeeded, whereas during earlier periods, such as the Middle Ages, soldiers armed with "pole" weapons such as spears were usually at a disadvantage versus cavalry (unless there were compensating features such as rough ground or bad weather), even though these were their "primary" weapons. What gave soldiers with bayonets (and muskets) their effectiveness? Did the one volley of musket fire sufficiently disorganize the cavalry to give the bayoneters their advantage? Did the presence of muskets force a change in cavalry tactics (e.g. the removal of armor) that favored the musketeer? Were they just better-drilled soldiers than the spear carriers? 

In the 1920s, Turkey was led, militarily and politically by Mustapha Kemal, who was later designated as "Ataturk" or "Father of the Turks." In terms of his importance to the country, think of George Washington in the United States. During World War I, Kemal was "working his way up," at battles like Gallipoli, which the Turks won, even while they were losing other battles. Basically, the Turks won where Kemal was in charge, and lost elsewhere. But when Kemal was made Supreme Commander, at the beginning of the War of Independence, they won just about everywhere, because he was in charge everywhere. 

One reason was that the Nazis originally considered the possibility of making a "last stand" at a "national redoubt" in Southern Germany. The idea was that these mountainous areas might be more defendable than Berlin, located on the northern European plain. Prague, and possibly Vienna might have been eastern "anchors" of such a holding. In the last days of the war, Goering went south as part of the plan, and Hitler "toyed" with the idea, but ultimately decided to stay in Berlin, where he committed suicide. His appointed successor, Admiral Karl Doenitz, elected to retreat to German naval bases in the northwest, from which he felt most comfortable surrendering. So nothing ever came of the "national redoubt" plan. Put another way, the issue was not one of moving the Prague troops to Berlin, but rather moving "Berlin" to the Prague troops. 

The Holy Roman Empire was never a real "country," but rather a motley confederation of mostly independent (mostly German-speaking) states. During the Middle Ages, it did, however, prove itself capable of rallying behind an elected Emperor for crusading or other religious purposes. In contrast to other answerers above, I date the (de facto, not de jure) collapse of the Holy Roman Empire to the Thirty Years War, 1618-1648, between the Swedish-led (Protestant) north German states, and the Austrian-led (Catholic) south German states. By splitting the "empire" into Protestant and Catholic camps, the long war destroyed the common ethos that had hitherto bound the different states, and made the "confederation" a shell of disunited, often warring entities. 

In 1937, the Indian Independence Movement conducted provincial elections that clearly demonstrated the will of the people. It also "wound down" an earlier campaign of armed resistance. Finally, Indians gave "qualified" support to Britain in World War II. The Indian Independence Movement showed the world that the Indians were capable of self-government. In so doing,it created a situation that would have led to independence "eventually," although World War II probably speeded up the process. 

Judea has always been a key part of the "land bridge" that connects what we now know as the Arab world, specifically north Africa and the Middle East. In biblical times, Judea was the gateway by which Egypt attacked Middle Eastern countries, and vice-versa. In 146 BC For instance, Ptolemy VI, aided by Jonathan Macabee, had invaded Syria and captured Selucia. That's why Antiochius VII Sidetes found it necessary to bring Macabee's nephew, John Hyrcanis to heel. Earlier on, Nebuchadnezzar of Assyria had dissolved the Judea of its last king, Zedekiah, when the latter had allied with Egypt in order to start a rebellion. Your earlier recollection about mountain fortresses is correct. Judea is located on a plateau, through which north-south trade routes pass through (and can therefore be blocked by) strongly fortified cities. Perhaps the strongest, and certainly the most famous of these cities is Jerusalem. According to Wikipedia: 

I can think of a number of reasons, but they fall under two categories: 1) Logistics and 2) Morale Logistics. With the Japanese islands cut off from the outside world, the Japanese islands could not produce enough food to feed its population and the soldiers already on the islands. Pulling another 2-3 million troops from China would have only aggravated that problem. Whereas the soldiers in China could feed themselves and "smuggle" some food to the home islands past the naval blockade. Finally, as Pieter pointed out, holding China (and its food-producing areas) prevented the Allies from easily capturing them, and using the food and other supplies for the invasion (instead of bringing them thousands of miles from the United States). Morale. With the Allied blockade, not all of the Japanese forces would have been successfully repatriated. Perhaps half of them might have been sunk by Allied ships. Having half the China army at the bottom of the sea would have probably done more damage to morale than the (shell-shocked) survivors would have contributed to the defense. And oddly enough, when a country is threatened with invasion, having an overseas "colony" may be a consolation; at least someone else is worse off than you are. 

Here are some observations: They do NOT substitute for a history of origins. The American system seems to have three ranks for every two unit levels. For instance, a second lieutenant is a platoon commander, and a captain is a company commander, meaning that a first lieutenant is a "floater" who can be either a "senior" second lieutenant, or an adjutant company commander. Likewise, a major commands a battalion, a colonel a regiment, and a lieutenant colonel can be a senior "major" (battalion commander) or junior to a colonel in the regimental command. Actually, a platoon can be commanded by either a senior sergeant or a second lieutenant, and the latter should be the floater position, with a company commander called a captain just above a second lieutenant, at the level of first lieutenant. Then a "captain" should be lieutenant major, while the rank above a major is a lieutenant colonel. Originally, this "lieutenant" structure did not apply to generals so a one star general was a brigade commander, a two star "major" general a division commander, a three star "lieutenant" general a corps commander, and a four star general a "full" general of an "army" of over 100,000 men. A five star general would be the general of the "Army" (as opposed to the navy or marines. But when divisions went from four regiments to three, thereby abolishing brigades, brigadier generals (in effect) became "floaters between regiments commanded by colonels and divisions commanded by major generals. 

Ironically, people in Taiwan speak Mandarin. So "dialect" is not the cause of the PRC-ROC split. Instead, it goes back to the Chinese civil war of the early 1930s and late 1940s (interrupted by the Japanese invasion of 1937-45). Historically, the split has been between the more traditional, orderly Mandarin-speaking north, and the looser, more entrepreneurial Cantonese-speaking south. That's where dialect may come into play (or at least serve as a proxy for more fundamental differences). 

Britain tended to ally with the second strongest country on the Continent against the FIRST. This was often for balance of power reasons. For many of those "close to 1000 years," France (with the best climate and largest population in western Europe) was the strongest country, and the greatest threat to Britain, and Britain would ally with others (e.g. small German states) against her. But after the Franco-Prussian War, the defeat of France, and the unification of Germany, Germany became the strongest Continental power (and a very aggressive one), France second, and Britain allied with the second (France) against the first (Germany). Under the circumstances, the change of alliances was not surprising. As Lord Palmerston would say, "We have no eternal alliances and no perpetual enemies. Only our interests are eternal and perpetual." 

Lafayette was a noble who had helped start the French Revolution, and had also participated in the American Revolution. Those facts made him a "revolutionary," (and a repeat offender) which counted for more than the fact that he was a moderate one. ("Degrees of badness" wasn't operative to Austrian royalists.) He was imprisoned or detained, the Austrians believed, until a rightful French king could be restored to the throne, at which time he would be handed back to said king. The Austrians didn't believe or realize that it would be years until there was another French king (even one of non-royal birth like Napoleon Bonaparte), which is why Lafayette was detained for so long. 

The Swabian princes were "overthrown" in the Revolution of 1848 and forced by democratic forces to accept constitutional monarchies. When they couldn't get along with the democrats, they turned to the Prussians for military help to restore "order." Prussia was by far the most militaristic power in Germany and it had interests in protecting their Rhine territories from "revolution" even though the center of its power (Berlin) was at the opposite end of modern Germany from Swabia. And the fact that they were related to the Prussian rulers was a factor in the speed and power of the Prussian response. At this point, the princes chose the "lesser of two evils" which was to hand over their principalities to Prussia (and keep it in the Hohenzollern family), or lose control altogether. The princes also made cash sales of their principalities that enabled them to maintain their lifestyles and a semblance of their former dignity. 

"Officially," the first known harvesting of redwood trees was after the start of the 1849 gold rush, when white men arrived in large numbers. It may have been "possible" to do this earlier, but we may never know because this was when implement was first put to tree. (There may have been some harvesting by Spanish or Russian settlers that was not recorded.) Unofficially, the redwood may have been "harvested" by Native American tribes who had been in the region for about 1000 years. These people however, used fire to "fell" large trees, not the advanced methods you mentioned. 

One reason is that leaders didn't know about particular diseases in relatively remote areas or how to fight/treat them. In the examples you cited, European soldiers died of yellow fever in Haiti, and plague in Egypt. Those were tropical diseases that European commanders knew little about. In such cases, locals or "natives" had the advantage over them. By the late 18th century, European commanders knew something about "nothern" diseases such as infections or scurvy, that could be controlled by sanitation in one instance, or citrus fruits in the other case. But Europeans would have problems in places like Latin America and Africa, where they did not know about, or at least fully understand, diseases peculiar to those climates. 

South America was initially divided into the Spanish and Portuguese speaking parts by the Treaty of Tordesillas. The Portuguese part is Brazil, the Spanish part consists of most of the rest of South America. The Spanish part was subdivided into New Granada (north), Peru (center), and La Plata (south). The Andes Mountains subdivided each of these parts; e.g. Venezuela and Colombia in New Granada, Peru and Bolivia in the center, and Chile from the rest of La Plata in the South. The La Plata river itself spawned three countries around major cities: Asuncion (Paraguay), Montevideo (Uruguay), and Buenos Aires (Argentina. The independence of New Granada was won by Simon Bolivar of modern Venezuela, of the south by Jose San Martin of modern Argentina, and of Peru, jointly between the two. Not even the "common" liberators was enough to keep the geographically separated pieces from going their separate ways. 

There was a quote attributed to Mao tse-tung "What if they killed 300 million of us? We would still have many people left." It's possible that he never said that in public. But it has become part of the Chinese "lore." Statements of the sort were released during the period leading up to the 1964 announcement of the Chinese atomic bomb, and reflected the Chinese view that "when we have a bomb, we can play the "MAD" (mutually assured destruction) game as well as anyone." More to the point, the quote reflects the ultimate Chinese defense strategy: In the event of an all out war, nuclear or not, against say, a coalition of the US, Russia, and Japan, China would "cede," if necessary, the eastern one-third of the country and hold out by "holing up" in the western two-thirds, just like in World War II. 

I'm also basing my answers on the links provided in the question. The interpretations are mine. Erik V's reign was "snakebit" from the beginning. His father died when he was two years old. Any number of nobles tried to take advantage of his mother, and one of them, Duke Valdemar, succeeded in capturing the mother and Erik himself. He spent part of his childhood as a prisoner of the Duke. When Erik grew older, many of his mother's enemies became his enemies. To his credit, he managed to make peace with the Church (the Pope, actually), as a young man. But others were hard to placate. The nobles who had spent over twenty years "running wild" wasn't about to take orders from a young man. Nothing he did, or would do, with the possible exception of abdicating, could please them. Because he was basically the "first among equals," the nobles forced him to grant them a "handfaesting" that preserved noble powers while limiting his. The nobles were not content to stop there. They bribed his "best friend," Rane Jonson, to spy on him. Then the "friend" set him up for a bloody murder. The handfaestning of Erik V was not like the Magna Charta. The former was unique to King Erik V, and each subsequent Danish king or queen signed a different document with his or her nobles until absolute monarchy was established in 1660. The latter was a permanent document that bound all kings of England, including Queen Elizabeth II, for all time. 

Fortresses took a value out of military importance (in modern times) because sentimental value. The classic example was Stalingrad in World War II. In the case of Santa Anna and the Alamo, it was pique as much as anything else. It had earlier been a fortress and base for the Mexican army. It had been captured, with 1500 defenders under Santa Anna's brother in law by 300 Texans under a crusty former junior officer named Ben Milam, who recruited these Texas rebels by beating the drum, and yelling 'who will go with old Ben Milam into San Antonio?" The dreaded "no prisoners' posture was a revenge for the humiliation. In the case of Verdun, Germany's General von Falkenhayn noted correctly that the Allies had a large preponderance of resources and manpower vs. Germany. Instead of drawing the logical conclusion that Germany should fight a war of decision, the German general proposed to "attrite" the Allies and force them into a negotiated peace. So he attacked the fortress of Verdun because it had sentimental value to France from past wars. His strategy at first succceeded, u then he kept expanding the effort, so what originally started as a two to one rate of French to German casualties fell to five to four.
