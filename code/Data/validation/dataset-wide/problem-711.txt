The main benefit is corrosion resistance at a slightly higher cost. Plus the near chrome like finish looks better. 

Many upgrade components will perform better than their lower cost counterpart, many are just lighter. Sometimes the weight savings comes at the cost of reliability. I would try to test ride some more bikes with higher end components even if you have to beg borrow or plead. While on the ride try to notice if the shifts seem smoother, the saddle fit better, the brakes seem steadier, the handling crisper less twitchy. If you don't feel the difference between your 105 and Ultegra don't spend the money on that upgrade. If your butt feels like you went to heaven then upgrade the saddle. The best way to get the most for your money is to upgrade as items need replacement. If it is broken or worn out the extra cost of better components 25 to 50 percent more than the original. 

The Merida website list the crankset as FSA Gossamer Pro 52-36 386. FSA's web site show this to be a pressfit bottom bracket. Why it is spec'd as attached rather than pressfit I don't know. It is possible that this is how it was translated into English. 

If the material seems unwashable try filling a thin sock or pantyhose with baking soda/sodium bicarbonate and dust the inside with it.Open the flap and tap the sock against the interior just hard enough to leave some of the powder over the entire interior.Let it sit overnight and vacum out any residue.You can leave the sock in the pannier so it will continue to absorb odors or try some charcoal in a small cloth pouch.Charcoal can be the kind used for grilling but make sure it is lump charcoal without any self ignitor added. 

The shine is likely the residue from the sticker adhesive. I would apply some rubbing alcohol on a soft cloth and see if it comes off. As you haven't damaged the actual finish, it will be fine. I had a similar finish on a Diamondback Response. After its' first wash I waxed it. I thought I had ruined the matte finish. When the wax wore off the original finish returned. 

This to be done with caution and patience. I recently did it using a long 3/8" carriage bolt that I purchased from the hardware store. I placed a washer on the bolt screwed on two nuts then another washer. Install the bolt in the axle notch of the forks. slowly move the nuts outward gradually spreading the fork. I did it slowly over several hours although I don't know if it is really necessary. You will want to go 3mm-4mm wider than needed as the fork will spring back a little when the bolt is removed. You must also be aware that the old style forks do not have the recessed seat ( known by some as lawyer lips) to retain the skewer if it comes loose. 

Shimano Hydraulic brakes are often sold as a kit, with the hose already connected to the caliper and lever and the system already bled. These kits are listed according to which hand the lever is for (the front brake's lever can be on the right or left according to country and preference) , whether the caliper is intended for the front or rear (the caliper body is usually the same but the fittings can vary) and hose length (to allow for different frame sizes and suspension designs/travel). The lever clamp is almost always about 22.2mm (7/8th inch). The caliper mount on the frame or fork will be IS-mount (bolts from the side) or post-mount (bolts parallel with the rotor). M640 brakes are natively post-mount. Adapters are available to fit PM calipers to IS mounts. Adapters are also used if a larger rotor is used. The normal rotor sizes for calipers without an adapter, or using a "+0mm" adapter for mismatched mounts, are 160mm at the front, 140mm at the rear.

Many tyres can be made to work without a tube, but tubeless tyres tend to work fine with tubes. The bead of a tubeless tyre is smooth and moulded more accurately than non-tubeless tyres, to form a tighter seal with tubeless-compatible rims. You may be able to achieve tubeless running with a non-tubeless tyre, but it's likely you will need to use more sealant compound. Some tubeless systems use a standalone valve, others use a valve integrated into the rim strip. For "ghetto tubeless", you can take an innertube from a smaller size and cut it to resemble the tubeless rim strips that have valves. (I've never done this, YMMV). If you don't mind getting messy with sealant, try it. If you fail, fit a tube! 

This principle, "Knee Over Pedal Spindle" or KOPS is archaic and wrong. It assumes ideal morphology. I am about 6ft/185cm tall. For my height, I have comparatively short legs. I have large feet, size EU48/UK13/US14. KOPS gives me inappropriate knee and ankle angles. 

If your BB uses a threaded interface, there will be a tool interface. For Shimano Hollowtech II style cranksets, threaded BBs sit outboard of the frame with notches needed by the tool clearly visible. 

I usually use an old spoke nipple. Slide it over the end and crimp with an electrical (stake-on/solderless connector) crimper. 

Don't forget to rule out a spoke or spoke nipple as the cause.Check the liner for any spots that look like they may have worn thin. With mass produced wheels a tool mark on the nipple may be the cause. 

You might want to talk to a motorcycle shop that does paint. They are most likely setup to do smaller parts with lots of details. They would be more familiar with masking threaded holes and bearing surfaces. 

Nashbar has sram 7 speed cassettes under $20 their part#is SR-PG730.They aren't the best they ever made but at the price you could buy two.I would splurge and get a new chain so you won't ruin your new cassette.Take all the money you were going to spend on up grades and save it towards a new bike or a later model used bike when this cassette wears out in 2000 miles. 

There are replacement hangers to adapt a modern deraileur to horizontal drops. I have never used one and can't say how well they work. BikeParts.com lists this Shimano compatable piece ID#: BPC109497 that may do the trick. Talk to someone at the LBS (local bike shop) first,if you get it locally you will be able to try it for fit before buy it. 

It will work but as JackM. states make sure you limits are adjusted precisely.You also have to decide if you want to risk over shifting on the low gear or high side. 

The problem I had was getting the ammonia to the corrosion. I hung the bike upside down by both tires so the seat post was vertical. You can either remove the bottom bracket or as I did the bottle cage screw and fill the seat post with straight ammonia. If possible plug the hole so the ammonia doesn't evaporate. I let it hang for 2 days. I then laid the bike on its' side and put a 36" pipe wrench on the seat post and cranked. It broke loose luckily before the seat tube bent. The key is time. The ammonia has to seep down the entire length of the seatpost. Let the ammonia soak for at least 2 days so the chemical reaction has a chance to happen. 

To add a rear disc brake you must have a frame with a disc mount. You will also need a rear wheel that has a disc compatible hub. Unless you find a really good deal on something used you will spend more than the bike is worth. If you feel the rear V brakes were insufficient, your money would be better spent getting quality shoes for the rear. Some riders claim good quality V shoes work as well as low end discs. 

BB92 is also known as PF41. The shell width should be 91.5mm and the inner diameter should be 41mm. 30mm: According to SRAM's 1x11 frame fit specifications, the inner part of the XX1 "spider" sits 45.5mm from the centreline (Dimension W1). The equivalent dimension is 43.5mm for X1 cranksets. MTB BBs compatible with Hollowtech 2 should have a fully-assembled width of 96.5mm. Road HT2 BBs should have a fully-assembled width of 91mm. It won't be possible to fit SRAM 30mm cranks to a BB92-spec frame without permanently modifying the frame. There are various systems which use a 30mm diameter axle and greater lengths, including Rotor, Hope, and eThirteen. GXP: Many brands produce BB92/PF41 bottom brackets for GXP cranksets, but this combination is not common so many retailers won't have them in stock. Hope offer converters to allow GXP axles to be used with their 24mm bottom brackets. These should not be used with Shimano BBs as they already have a plastic "top-hat" spacer between the bearings' inner casings and the axle, whereas Hope use bearings with a 24mm. 

This depends on: Rider's centre of mass relative to the front axle (x and y). Fork spring rate or air pressure. Fork damping settings. Braking force over time. Fork offset and frame head angle. Could be calculated with something like Matlab but you're looking at university-level vehicle dynamics modeling. Far easier just to test it. 

Giant may vary the spec in other markets, but I found this listing: $URL$ The rim width isn't listed, but with 32mm tyres, Sheldon suggests 15-19mm. The gearing on the stock wheel is a 7-speed screw-on freewheel, but getting a wheel with a freehub and a 7-speed cassette should not cause problems. Without disc brakes, the dropout width could be 130mm or 135mm; as this hybrid looks to be designed more like a mountainbike than a roadbike, 135mm is more likely. 

In bicycle hydraulic brakes, there are systems designed for DOT (3/4/5.1) brake fluid, and systems designed for mineral oil. Using the wrong fluid can damage seals and cause terminal failure (and death). As far as I know, all oil used in MTB suspension is essentially the same basic fluid, plus additives. CitroÃ«n did use mineral-based "LHM" fluid for decades but eventually gave in and fell in-line with the rest of the auto industry. Bicycle suspension forks tend to use light oils. Gear oil will be too thick. Motor oil may have additives to help it perform in an engine which might interfere with the operation of your fork. The first three in your list are usualy synonyms. The owner's manual for your fork should specify the oil grade and either a volume to measure or a method to judge the right level. If your fork also uses grease, I'd be more concerned about using the original manufacturer's fluids and grease, but otherwise any suspension oil of the correct grade should be fine. 

I have no experience with this drum set up but with similar industrial applications centering the brake band is critical.I would measure from the inner brake surface to the inside of the housing.Do this at several points.If it is off center one side makes contact and the otherside vibrates causeing the noise.Cleaning of the drum surface is important,try alcohol.If the brake material is leather Idont know what to clean it with.If it an organic material sand lightly with medium sand paper. 

For a short commute in street clothes I opted for flat bars with bar end extentions. This allows some different hand positions and for me a more comfortable upright position. If you are riding for the first time is several years, bike fit is more critical than bar type. A bike that is the wrong size will never be comfortable no matter what type bar it has. 

Position the clamp so that the open section of the clamp is oriented to the slot in the frame. If the frame slot faces the rear the opening in the clamp should also face the rear. 

On your particular shock, it is as you guessed just a cover to keep out dirt. Replacement parts for these shocks are generally not available. I would suggest a visit to a local hardware store and find a generic rubber /plastic plug that will fit in the hole. 

I use sleeves made of old inner tubes. It is soft enough to prevent scratches but still durable. Slide it over the "U" portion and put another piece over the lock body leaving holes in the tube for the U to slide into the catch. 

There is no simple rule that says here is ok but here is not.You don't want to use it on any bearings as the lube.I have used on bearing races at the mating surface,where the race presses into the frame.You can use it on the seat tube,crank arms are ok but not the crank arm bolts. Use it pretty much any place metal parts are pressed together.You want to avoid the threads of critical fasteners as it can allow them to loosen over time.On quick release skewers antisieze on the shaft is ok,but avoid the threaded portion.Also avoid the clamp sections of the stem,you want a tight grip between the stem and the bars and the stem and the steerer tube.I guess the easiest way to think about where to use is any place that has a close tolerence fit that is subject to corrosion but in everyday use doesn't move.
