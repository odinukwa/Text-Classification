"World War" I was largely a war between France and Germany. The problem was, that France couldn't really afford the war with Germany (remember, they lost the war in 1870), so they heavily borrowed from the US, as did Britain. Meanwhile, Germany had a highly industrialized economy and could afford to pay most of the war's cost out of their own pockets. Germany was fighting a war on 2 fronts. By 1917, a large numbers of war casualties and persistent food shortages in the major urban centers of Russia brought the February Revolution in Russia, which forced Tsar Nicholas II to abdicate. The position of the Provisional Government led the Germans to offer support to the Russian opposition, the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in particular, who were proponents of Russia's withdrawal from the war. In April 1917, Germany allowed Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin to return to Russia, and financially supported him. In return, Lenin pretty much immediate announced the withdrawal of Russia from the war. Now, think about it: Meanwhile, the war in the west was more or less at a stalemate, with France & Britain combined barely holding the lines. 4.5 million allied soldiers vs. 5 million German soldiers at the western front. Then comes the peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (actually signed later), which ends Russia's participation in World War I. Soon after, more than 2 million German soldiers moving from the eastern front to the western front. What do you think would have happened ? Barely stalemate in the west, and now here there come 2 million German soldiers in reinforcements... Quite frankly that meant France & Britain were screwed, the war was lost for the allies, and the USA could write-off all the money they lended (at least to France). To give you an idea of the epic proportions, during World War 1, the US debt level rose from virtually nothing to about 33% of GDP. Previously, in 1915, the US had decided to send the Lusitania (at that time an armed Merchant Cruiser, not a passenger ship) to Europe, on board ~173 metric tons of weapons for Britain (and troops?). Newspapers advertisements by the German embassy in the US in the New York Times warned everybody not to board the ship, as it was liable to destruction. When the ship reached Ireland, destroyers escorting the ship were are ordered to leave (with the express intent of leaving it vulnerable), which made the ship an easy and very inviting target for German U-Boats. As the ship came under attack (inside the declared "zone of war"), and called for help, the destroyers were ordered to stand-by and do nothing. This had turned public opinion in the US against Germany, since the presence of the weapons were conveniently omitted at the time. Due to the "political" pressure this created (a possible US entry into the war), Germany stopped the unrestricted U-Boat war against Britain. So, with the German government seeing the end of the war in the east coming, on January 31st 1917, Germany resumed the unrestricted U-Boat war (in the war-zone). Three days later, the United States broke diplomatic relations with Germany, and just hours after that, the American ship Housatonic was sunk by a German U-Boat. Consequently, on the 22nd of February, the US congressed pushed a USD 250 million arms bill, with the intent to ready the United States for war. 4 more US "merchant" ships were subsequently sunk by German U-Boats in March. Then, on April 2nd, US President Woodrow Wilson appeared before Congress and called for a declaration of war against Germany. On the 4th of April the war-declaration passed through the senate, and two days later, it was endorsed by the House of Representatives. With that, America entered World War I. A year later, Germany was "defeated" (acknowledged the futility of continuing) by the "allies", and the "peace treaty" of Versailles, which actually was an armistice for about 20-25 years, was signed. The fact that it wasn't a peace treaty also explains why the blockade and torpedoing of German commercial vessels continued well after the armistice was signed. In the treaty of Versailles, Germany was declared the "sole culprit" of the war, and had to pay the equivalent of 960'000'000 kg gold in "reparations", which at today's gold price means about 33.6 trillon US dollars. Later, as the US couldn't pay its debts, because France and Britain couldn't pay them back because Germany couldn't pay the insane reparation payments, the US loaned money to Germany (at 7% interest), to pay back France and Britain, which payed back the US; loans on Hitler later defaulted on the payments. Post-1945, the Federal republic of Germany had to agree to pay those loans back. 

I think the real answer basically boils down to attrition. Over the years, the US has minted many denominations of coins, ranging from the half cent piece up to the $50 Half-Union coin: $URL$ Most of them have fallen out of use for various reasons, mostly because having many denominations proved inconvenient and/or confusing. The US did mint a 20 cent piece for a few years, but it was unpopular because it was easily confused with a quarter: $URL$ The same was true of the short-lived Susan B. Anthony dollar coin $URL$ which I suspect (along with the inconvenience of having two $1 coins of very different sizes) contributed to the current unpopularity of the dollar coin. (Gold coins are obviously a special case, thanks to FDR &c.) I'd guess that the use of cash registers also played a part, as they can easily fit only so many pockets for coins. Perhaps that also caused the virtual abandonment of the $2 bill, and is contributing to the decline I've seen in the use of the $10 bill. (My grocery store only gives out $5 bills in change, and any $10s you give them are tucked underneath the tray.) 

While Washington was generally reticent about his personal religious beliefs (or lack thereof), many think that he was a Deist (like many of the other Founding Fathers), paying only lip service to organized Christianity. and mostly for its societal effects - that is, that it helped establish public order & morality. What led to his Presidency was his generalship in the Revolution, and the almost universal admiration that Americans had for him. It had nothing whatsoever to do with the Church of England/Episcopalians, Catholics, or any other religion. Nor did the American Revolution arise out of religious differences. Most if not all of your question seems to bear no relation at all to actual history. You can find out a lot more by simply typing "george washington religious beliefs" into a search engine. Google gives about 640K hits. 

This question made me scratch my head for a minute. I think there may be some false premises in the OP's question that have been overlooked. I will paraphrase the Q: "Why didn't they aim nuclear weapons at each other at the places where their landmasses were the closest?" If that's a correct read of the question then it seems to assume a few things: 1. armies need to be in close proximity for a nuclear war 2. a nuclear war will mainly be against massed armies 3. the land itself is of the most value to fight about So 1: Nuclear weapons are mostly intended to be sent far, far away. Their immediate devastation and long-term effects make them something you don't want any good guys to be near, with the exception of last-resort weapons like the nuclear artillery and nuclear backpacks. Also there is no point having nukes facing off against nukes in an isolated theater. No one thinks they can kill the others' before launch, so if either one fired, the other would fire before the first guy's landed, meaning both sides' nukes would land on empty launchers and the skeleton crews manning them. Mostly though, point 1 hinges on point 2: While military equipment is indeed hardened against the effects of a nuclear blast and after-effect, nuclear strategy is not centered around destroying the bad guy's army, per se. Nuclear weapons are fielded with the intention of destroying the offending civilization in its entirety. Granted, the bad guy's army will hopefully be destroyed too, but if that were the real goal there would be far fewer nuclear weapons deployed -- only enough to kill military installations. A rough guess is it would only take 5 shots per opposing military installation to have a good chance of eliminating that installation. Meanwhile, when Reagan and the Soviets were negotiating arms reductions, the Soviets were looking at nuking the continental USA itself a few times over. 3: The reason we massed armies in West Germany was because that's where the people were. In some conflicts you just want land. So you go after the land. When you want to subdue a country, land is not the goal, so you go after its population centers and seats of gov't. Then, in the Civil War to subdue the south we changed things up to where you didn't just capture the capital city and declare victory-- you needed to kill the bad guy's army. And so it is to this day with conventional (non-nuclear war). However, as Semaphore pointed out, the cold war was a war of ideas and ideas aren't land and they aren't armies-- they're people who live in population centers. And with a war of ideologies you want to subdue the people. So that's where the armies are going to go. Now it apparently wasn't a GIVEN that the 3rd world war would be nuclear, or else why the massed military buildup in Europe? So what we can ultimately see is that the reason there weren't a bunch of nukes in the arctic is because there was no one there to kill. The non-nuclear armies wouldn't mass there either because there was nothing to defend other than land and since land isn't what either one was really going after it would be a waste to attack or defend en masse there. Finally, again there is no point having nukes facing off against nukes in an isolated theater where they won't knock out other nukes or kill lots of people. The reason that they fought everywhere but by each other's northern border is that they fought where people are, where people (governments) could be influenced. AND, I might add, these proxy wars were not nuclear standoffs, with the exclusion of Turkish and Cuban missiles which were emplaced to improve the ability to wipe out the other's center of civilization. 

Our dating system (assuming "ours" refers to the one used in mainstream western culture) is not based on astronomical events at all, It's based on the belief/records/mythology (pick your term according to your personal tastes) of the Christian religion - and even then, the creators of the system apparently got it wrong, as others have computed the date of Christ's birth as 4 BCE :-) For the astronomical events in various records, I think you've got the logic reversed. We can use celestial mechanics and other astrophysical stuff (see the astronomy site for details) to figure just how long ago comets, eclipses, supernovae &c happened, and then translate that to our dating system. But we could as easily translate to the Chinese, Islamic, Japanese, Roman, or whatever system. 

"I was under the impression that the European population was predominantly serfs during 15 and 16th century." Perhaps that impression is wrong? From the literature of the time, we see fairly ordinary people having some access to spices and other exotic foodstuffs. For instance, here's the son of a prosperous farmer going to market to buy supplies for a feast: "Let me see; what am I to buy for our sheepshearing feast? Three pound of sugar, five pound of currants, rice – what will this sister of mine do with rice? But my father hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it on […] I must have saffron to color the warden pies; mace; dates? – none, that’s out of my note; nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many raisins o’ th’ sun." (Shakespeare, The Winter’s Tale 4.3.36-48) 

There are a number of Biblical (Old Testament, so over 2000 years ago) mentions of such things, for instance Hosea 13:16, 2 Kings 15:16, Joshua 6:20-21, 1 Samuel 15:3, Psalms 137:8-9... The difference is that it's not accounts of one's enemies doing it to your people, but instructions for what your people should do to their enemies.
