So, while there is strong evidence for bows, daggers, axes and clubs being widespread among the warrior classes during the neolithic, defensive weapons like shields are notable by their absence. So, weapons probably preceded the shield in warfare. 

Napoleon loved forward momentum - and he got it with the heavy column. The formation forced his infantry forward, the front ranks constantly pushed to the fore by the ranks behind them, and made opponents break formation to get the hell out of the way. This worked, because Napoleon was an artilleryman - he would disrupt opposing line formations with artillery barrage and cavalry, and once an infantry column broke through, it was all but over for the opposing forces. Napoleon's genius was knowing the soft spot to send his columns towards, and how to best support the attack. Bear in mind that the "attack column" wasn't like a marching column or even an infantry square. The peleton, which translates as "platoon" or "rank", was either 80 men wide and 9 deep, or 40 men wide and 18 deep, and was the base unit of maneuver. So look at it more as successive waves of dense line formations. Once they're through the opposing line, peletons can wheel right or left to deliver flanking fire. Wellington went with a much thinner line, and relied on carefully chosen terrain, cavalry and counter-artillery to disrupt French artillery support. Retreat and redeploy was a common British tactic, changing the shape of the line, bending but never breaking. The British are never shown as retreating in historical fiction because they're supposed to be the "Good Guys" in most english-language media - nevertheless C.S. Forrester had a fantastic depiction of a typical British retreat, organized and in good order while under heavy fire, in his Hornblower series. (Marines rather than infantry, but you get a good idea how this was drilled and practiced.) The other trick was to break French discipline with a two-volleys-and-bayonet-charge drill which caused the front of the attack column to break ranks, to rush to engage the enemy, which left them helpless to respond to flanking fire and too disorganized to take advantage of their break-through or allow the rest of the column to engage. 

Apart from the half-tone process, the other component was the process that allowed the photographer to scan their photo on location, and then send it back to the home office by way of telegraph or telephone. The first of these technologies was the Telediagraph that demanded special telegraph connections. By WWII, the process was refined enough to use ordinary telephone connections, even over intercontinental lines, and inexpensive enough where even remote branch offices of major news services and large daily papers had one on-site. Some offices had equipment could scan and send photos by short-wave radio. 

The Khwarezmian Empire was a dynamic and expanding empire in Central Asia, and they were completely destroyed by the Mongols. 

Because with Sardinia-Piedmont comes the House of Savoy, a powerful political and trade dynasty with far-reaching influence throughout Europe. 

Ah. The issue is Marija Gambutas, a well-respected anthropologist, archaeologist and scholar of linguistics. She did some groundbreaking work on the dissemination of Indo-European languages and the history of the baltic and slavic peoples, and was pretty near the top of her profession. Then she went a little nuts. She became involved in Second Wave Feminism and Environmentalism, which is in and of itself no bad thing (most of her colleagues were as well - it was the '60s), but then she started making some ahistorical claims in support of her politics not validated by archaeological or linguistic evidence, which is kind of a bad thing. Her "Goddess" books became real popular with New Age movements of all descriptions, and real unpopular with other experts in the field. Here is a good article in the New York Times that explains the controversy. 

This paper in Nature is fascinating - unfortunately, the chemical studies described were not performed on ancient East Asians, but it lines up with archaeological and anthropological evidence worldwide. 

The Sans-Culottes were laborers and peasants and those aligned with them who were in opposition to the aristocracy. Their appellation comes from their distinctive outfit - long cotton pants commonly worn by laborers, as opposed to the knee-breeches (culottes) favored by the wealthy and hangers-on (to show off their expensive hosiery and shoes). In addition to their eponymous pants, they wore the short-skirted coat and wooden clogs also favored by commoners, and a "red cap of liberty." 

That particular helmet is of 20th century design - 19th century pith helmets were initially modelled on the Pickelhaube. No hellenic connection as far as I can see. 

The Stele of the Vultures shows Sumerian spearmen employing shields - it's from the middle of the third millennium BCE. While long bronze daggers are found in parts of Anatolia about this time, true bronze swords longer than 60cm and strong enough to be used for weapon-to-weapon combat, would take another thousand years to become prevalent as metalworking improved. On the other hand (pdf): 

Jared Diamond refers to "Hittite-like names in Assyrian," and there's a (possibly mythical) Hittite king from 23rd century bce, Pamba. 

The Live Science article in question appears to reflect a minority viewpoint not well supported by archaeological or historical evidence - if the Egyptians or Hittites tangled with a major thalassocracy like the Minoans, they didn't document it, and they documented pretty much everything else going on. This supports the idea that the Minoan defenses were impressive enough to make the other regional powers keep their distance, but they were not aggressive or "warlike". 

It is sometimes argued, albeit farcically in the manner of "For the want of a horseshoe nail", that WWII was started over Germany's inability to deliver telegraph poles it owed to France and Belgium. For the want of a telegraph pole, the Ruhr was occupied. For the want of a free Ruhr, a shaky economy was sent into a death spiral. For the want of a prosperous economy, the Weimar Republic was destabilized politically. For the want of a stable government, the Nazis were able to take over and start re-arming. For the want of a regime that wasn't evil, the world erupted into war. All for the want of a telegraph pole. But this is less of a national debt issue than the Allies screwing themselves by burdening Germany with outrageous reparations demands, and then following through on collecting them by force. It convinced Germany of the need to re-arm, and gave the German people a smoldering hatred of the Allied Powers that allowed Hitler's broader war schemes to blossom. 

Actually, no... the first submarines used in warfare appeared in the Revolutionary War, and two more were deployed (unsuccessfully) by the US in the War of 1812. 1) No, because they weren't very practical or successful until John Phillip Holland and Electric Boat perfected the battle submarine at the turn of the century. 2) The first modern military submarine was the Toro Submarino launched in 1880 - it had a torpedo tube and a gas/electric drive system. 3) The first submarine kill in actual combat was by the German U-21 in 1914. 4) The very first operable submarine was built to amuse King James I by Cornelius Drebble. The first successful powered submarine was the Ictineo II, whose inventor fitted it with pneumatic cannon in an attempt to secure funding from the Spanish navy... so it was designed as a development platform for a weapon of war. 

A collection of 26 Babylonian recipe tablets written in Akkadian from 1700BC have been deciphered. Here is an interesting newspaper article on the translations by a chef-turned-antiquarian: 

The confusion is due to the difference between the Links - the sandy, grassy areas unsuitable for crops or buildings near the coast - and the course - the actual arrangement of tees, holes and traps. While the Links at St. Andrews has been home to golf for longer, the actual course is newer - in the early 19th Century, the links had to accomodate rabbit farmers as well as golfers! The course at Musselburgh Links has been in continuous operation for longer, and they have documented evidence of it. 

The other component was the Great Depression, which coincided with the expiry of the self-service business model patent held by Piggly-Wiggly - customers could now select and package their own purchases, in freely provided shopping bags (who's patent was also up.) Cash-strapped customers shopped at self-service establishments, as the prices were lower than full service shops. Before shopping bags and self-service, salesclerks would bring merchandise to the counter from shelves or a stockroom for customer inspection, and package the purchase in paper and twine to make it easier to carry and to protect the item on the journey home. It took a while for the self-service model to completely take over retail and obsolete paper-and-twine... and some retailers and shops kept up the custom as a way to differentiate the level of service they provided, until shoppers simply didn't care, and preferred the convenience of a shopping bag. 

Yes - the most famous of these is the Stonewall Riots, in NYC in 1969. But there is actually a long history of direct action in support of gay rights predating Stonewall, some of them violent. 

Hypatia was killed by order of the Church for being a scientist who dared to believe things that were contrary to Holy Scripture... and so was Giordano Bruno. In between, there were a lot of people killed and documents declared heretic. Then there is the Index Liborum Prohibitorum - an Index of Prohibited Books - that made scientific texts like Kepeler's unavailable in Catholic countries from the creation of the printing press until well into the 18th century. Let's look at some of the scientists banned by the Index: 

With the invention of the printing press came not only books, but artwork intended for mass production. The first major artist to use printmaking as his medium was the otherwise anonymous Master of the Playing Cards, who, true to his name, made his living creating beautifully elaborate engravings for playing cards. Playing cards of the time featured religious and secular art, as well as, you know, nekkid ladies. The Master of the Playing Cards depicted St. Sebastian as an attractive male figure study in what could be interpreted by some as a seductive pose, inadvertently creating the first mass-market male pin-up in Renaissance Europe. Since then, a handsome St. Sebastian in coquettish poses has been done and done again by the later masters. The linked wiki page has a copy of the scandalously salacious engraving, if you're into that sort of thing (Renaissance art and the history of mass media, I mean.) 

Since that didn't do the trick, her conspirators strangled him, dumped him in the woods, and framed Blackadder for it. No, really. 

This is probably the Ichihara pump, from late 19th century Japan - their first four-wheeled horse drawn engine was built in 1899. There is very little english language information on the company online. Japan has a long and fascinating tradition of firefighting, the hikeshi, going back centuries. They used hollow bamboo ladders and portable hand-pumps to put water onto the fire, but really, their job was to rescue people and valuables, organize bucket brigades and tear down neighboring structures to keep the fire from spreading. The concept of wheeled fire-engines probably came with the Meiji Restoration. 

This seemed to be something of a pass-time among antiquarians in the 19th century. As for the coin, if it is indeed a map, I see no reason to interpret the landmass as anything other than Britain, and the little bits labeled "British Isles" as the Channel Islands or, if you want to get really wild, the southern edge of Scandinavia, which is just a tad closer than North America. ("Asia" is likely the Arabian Peninsula) When you see hoofprints, think horses, not zebras. 

Without access to the deliberations in the Russian Presidential cabinet, I doubt we'll ever know for sure, but it looks like it was built as a propaganda project. It's a showpiece, and not meant to fill a practical role. Despite the enormous cost, there are three reasons why it may have seemed a good idea at the time. 1) China is rapidly modernizing, and Chinese public works and architectural projects seen as the most advanced in the world. By building the bridge, Russia can prove to other regional players in the Asian Pacific that it is still relevant as an industrial power. Russia has spent the equivalent of $21bln USD on infrastructure upgrades to Vladivostok in the hopes of luring more international business - Mazda has just opened up a plant, and others will be opening soon. The bridge is just a landmark, a billion dollar sandwich-board announcing that the Russian East is a part of the industrialized and modern Asian Pacific. 2) It was built in competition with the Gravina Island "Bridge to Nowhere" - it was a pure pork-barrel boondoggle, but a resurgent Russia influenced by Putin's leadership may have misread the politics and seen it as US vanity project to demonstrate its wealth and power in the Pacific Rim. Putin is a seasoned "cold warrior", and the urge to one-up a traditional rival with an even more extravagant folly may have proven overwhelming to his party's policy in the far east. 3) The United Russia party can get political support from allies in Vladivostok to advance their agenda with a pork barrel payoff to businesses and workers, and this will keep the region loyal to the Administration in Moscow despite the distance. 

Here's an interesting article on the topic, from the Santa Barbara Independent newspaper. It's titled, "What Did the Early Spanish Settlers Eat?" and should answer your questions: 

Prof. Dr. Christian Laes and Dr. Dorien Meulenijzer have put together a web resource for scholarship on this very topic: Disability History in the Ancient World. They have a nice bibliography (albeit in .PDF) that can give you an overview on how various ancient cultures defined and dealt with disability, from both primary sources and from archaeology. While many of the articles listed are not online, your friendly neighborhood librarian will be able to help you run down any that catch your eye. 

They also had a large base of slaves and serfs - agricultural specialists. Members of the nobility had specialized hereditary roles: military leaders, farm administrators, tax collectors, etc. There is some difference of opinion on the military - warfare was either carried out by and for the elite; or it was the duty of all social strata and distinguished military service resulted in social promotion. 

In medieval India, or, at least the portions ruled by Hindu empires (considered "Classical India" until the late 18th century), the functions of society were arranged differently than in modern nations or contemporaneous societies in Europe or Asia. Most notably, the caste system played a very important part - different castes were responsible for different parts of jurisprudence. Brahmins were involved in creating and adjudicating law at a high level, where the Kṣatriya were responsible for promulgation of that law, punishing the wicked, protecting the people and adjudicating minor legal disputes - so the "warrior caste" was explicitly responsible for both war and law enforcement. In short, there was no difference between the police or army. Members of the Kṣatriya caste filled both roles. Here's a wiki article on Classical Indian Law in Practice. 

1.) Germany, before WWI, was a very successful capitalist autocracy - they only became democratic at (literal) gunpoint. The rulers were hereditary - it was an imperial monarchy. Ditto Austria-Hungary. 2.) Spain spent most of the 20th Century as a capitalist power-house under Franco's dictatorship, something like the 8th largest economy. Portugal lasted just as long as a Fascist (in the political science sense of the word) dictatorship. From what I can see, pure free-market capitalism results in a corrupt oligarchy, and pure Marxist-Lenninist socialism (Communism) results in the same. 

The Celts were using "ring money" as early as 800bc, up until 300bc, when they picked up the idea of using coins from the Greeks. 

Do Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands count? Land-starved Japan ceding territory to the Soviet Union, a nation that ruled a landmass larger than some continents with only twice Japan's population, had to hurt, and bad... and still hurts to this day.
