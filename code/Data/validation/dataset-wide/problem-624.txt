The easy answer is a wide-brim hat or long visor on your helmet. This does work, at least at low speeds. You will have to experiment with options, as nothing like this is sold for this purpose as far as I can tell. Over about 20kph the length of brim you need gets silly, and by 30kph you need half a metre or so (there are some velomobile owners that do this). But if you're willing to slow down, the brim will work. I wear glasses, and haven't found a water-shedding coating that works well enough to be worth the hassle. In practice I use a clip-on visor on my bike helmet, extended a little so it's about 10cm in front of my forehead. That keeps the worst of the rain off. Then I ride fast enough that my glasses get wet anyway. But not as wet as without it. The visor/brim also reduces the amount of water running down my head and into my eyes, especially as that always seems to wash stale sweat out of the helmet pads and that stuff stings. A sweatband or headsock helps there. 

Look at the thread on the exposed cup. That tells you which way you need to turn the cup to get it out (there are multiple standards here, and one of the key differences is that some use left hand threads instead of the usual right hand). It looks to me as though the top of that cop should rotate to the right to remove it, in which case it is a left hand thread. You should be able to fit a spanner onto the raised part on the cup nearest the camera in that photo. Preferably a large spanner with nice sharp edges on the jaws, since the flats are not very deep. The other side possibly has a couple of holes rather than more flats like this side. In which case you can use a pin spanner or a hammer and chisel to tap it out. Or, as Sheldon suggests, just put a big bolt through and use that to turn the cup. 

Your second question, about having no handlebars, is much easier to do. Most front wheel drive, moving bottom bracket bikes can be ridden hands-off, and it's relatively easy to learn to ride without the handlebars at all. The problem is that most countries require bikes to have handlebars (it's an offence to ride without holding them). One problem I see with the design you link to is that it's partially rear wheel steered. That will affect stability (making the design somewhat harder, but if you're buying one they've already solved that problem). But it will also affect turning. To turn away from something, the rear wheel must move towards it. All rear wheel steer vehicles suffer from this problem. One partial solution is to use a tadpole tricycle configuration, so that the rear wheel is between the front wheels and thus can move sideways as far as one front wheel when turning away from a kerb or other barrier. For a bicycle, the solution is to stop and lift the bike away from the barrier. The problem is that if you run up next to a barrier at speed it may be difficult to stop without hitting the barrier. That's annoying if it's a kerb and you end up sliding along the footpath, but can be dangerous if it's a wall or hedge. With unusual bikes that someone is selling, I find it's helpful to ask how much someone other than the inventor has ridden one. If they've sold a few and someone has ridden a couple of thousand kilometres on one, then great, it's probably usable. But if it's a great project by one person and you're going to be the first real customer... be very careful. 

Which means that it's no longer a bicycle, it is a moped, scooter, or motorbike. Note that the bike can go faster, you just can't have a motor that operates while the bike is going faster. It's an interesting thing to police. The exact penalties that will be applied depend on the discretion of the law enforcement process you experience. A Police Officer might just ticket you for, say, "1. Drive motor vehicle, no permit" which is $85. Or they might be persuaded that you should attend court and explain your behaviour to a magistrate, in which case 

For most of the people who I've seen ride them it's because they're harder to push. The 4" fat tyres also have thicker walls, so flexing them takes more effort, on top of the greatly increased angular momentum. That means that commuting to work takes more effort. If you're trying to get fit, that's what you need. It's worth noting that many of these people also ride their fat bikes off road, sometimes quite ridiculously so. Australia is well supplied with "ridiculously off road" and a lot of that can't be ridden with skinny little 2" tyres. IME the comfort of 4" tyres is not much greater than 2" tyres, but the 4" ones are much harder to push. 4" also lose traction more easily on hard surfaces because of their (generally) harder compound and lower ground pressure. 

Going straight from the right turn lane is a bad idea, and very few legal systems allow it. Partly because it's suicidal, and partly because it's stupid. Either way, the legal authorities have to clean up the mess. So you should, and almost certainly are legally required to, enter the "straight ahead" lane in that situation. I typed a rough description into the google and got some examples of reflectors on poles like the light you're thinking about. 

Which is "no set fine" offence and you could face quite a lot of excitement, starting with "we will give your bike only to an approved mechanic who has agreed to modify it so that it is in conformance with the standard, and who will release it to you only once it does". If you are exceptionally lucky they will agree that turning it back into an e-bike is acceptable, but they could easily say "must be a conformant motorbike", and good luck with that. If the legal system wants to make your life unpleasant, they can. The trick is not to make any of them want to do that. This "getting away with riding an illegal e-bike" is only partly humorous, there is good advice. 

Stopping is relatively easy - the rearmost foot is pressing back/down on the pedal to operate the brake, the other goes on the ground. If you're used to two feet on the ground when stopped you'll need to practice stopping with one foot first. You probably need to swap anyway, so the foot on the pedals is ready to push down when you move off. It's vaguely annoying but you'll get used to it. To shuffle the pedals around while stationary you need to be pushing gently as if you're trying to pedal forwards, while rolling the bike backwards. Again, it's annoying. When I ride a bike like this I quickly get a little system organised so that I stop, rotate the pedals forward to disengage the brake and get ready to move off, then roll back a little until the foot that's on the pedal ready to start is in the right position. I do think you should fit a front brake of some sort just for safety. Braking with the rear wheel is less effective, especially in an emergency stop situation. Even a cheap caliper brake is better than nothing (and often that's all those bikes are set up for). 

Most of the Busch & MÃ¼ller IQ Dynamo lights seem to have this feature. Their lights have a well designed beam pattern, si it's hard to tell whether they're on or off during the daytime. So they have a pair of indicator LEDs on the back of the light, one for the front light, and one for the rear light. On my light they're orange and green, so it's easy to tell the difference. B&M have changed their product range since I bought my light, and they all look different now (this is a common "problem" when products last a long time). What I have is (I think) an IQ Fly from about 2010, and it looks more like the current "Avy" light than any of the others. If you look closely there's a transluscent bulge on the back of the light, where the LEDs are: 

You could easily modify one of those, or build your own. I believe they're legal, at least in Australia (where I live) but I suspect that no-one would pull you over if it's not (except in NSW, where I live, for reasons to stupid to go in to). Note that the problem you're trying to overcome is not drivers who are actually blind, but inattentional blindness. The photons are reaching their eyes, but their brain is filtering out all the distracting irrelevancies so they can actually operate their vehicle.At best cyclists fall into the "why would I look for a cyclist, there are no cyclists here" subconscious category of "things not to bother looking for". The way round that is to have so many cyclists on all the roads that motorists know they're always there and consequently look out for them. Overall, though, it sounds as though you either lack confidence or experience, or you're riding on very busy roads. It might help to browse the safety tag here for other answers.
