That definition was given in the 2004 rules for Combatant Status Review Tribunals and the definition used by some US courts (more info) More traditionally a combatant is someone taking part directly in an armed conflict. It seems very unlikely that any male over 15 would automatically be considered a combatant purely based on their sex and age. The claim seems to suggest that to be the case even when civilian targets were hit. This would violate a number of US and international laws and there are no evidence to that effect. 

Yes those numbers appear to be correct. The Cato instituted published "Terrorism and Immigration A Risk Analysis" in September 2016. From that report: 

So the reported did not create the precedent, the court did in Pembina Consolidated Silver Mining Co. v. Pennsylvania 

A lot of reputable news media outlets base those estimate on this site: $URL$ So it appears that the cost of the program was around $314 million, 20 bombs were delivered to the military thus the unit cost was ~ $16 million. It's not unusual for the first unit to have very high cost because of large capital investment (research, design, machines, etc) but the variable cost (how much it costs for materials & labor to build a bomb once you have all the facilities) to be fairly low. So the first bomb might be $200 million, the next 19 another 120 million, thus the average unit cost is $16 million and total program expenditure $320 million. If they build a 1000 more, the unit cost will probably go down. 

NASA has been asked this question before, and they cannot confirm that the Voyager was launched with Scapa Flow sourced steel; but, the story behind why it might have been included is interesting (although it seems like a chain of possibilities rather than proof that any such thing happened). The process of making steel involves superheating metal with forced-air blown furnaces. The air post-1945 is contaminated with trace radioactive elements. For some very sensitive types of equipment, like Geiger counters, the contamination from the furnace air sufficiently taints the steel, giving the steel a slight radioactive quality. The Scapa Flow scuttled fleet is a large amount of pre-1945 steel, and it is cheaper to rework it than to create steel in a scrubbed environment. However, the air of today is not as contaminated as the air of 1946. Today, there are many batches of steel produced which is of suffienctly low radiation that they can be used without the need to salvage ancient battleships. In addition, the Scapa Flow have mostly already been scrapped. The source of cheap Low Radiation steel by salvage operation has some sources indicating that Scapa Flow was mostly salvaged back in the 1930's although some steel was still being salvaged as late as the early 1970's. Finally, many of the space craft and space craft components are not sensitive to low levels of background radiation. There are many examples of space craft made with modern steel. The Voyager space craft did not launch with Geiger counters. One page details the sensors: television cameras, infrared and ultraviolet sensors, magnetometers, plasma detectors, and cosmic-ray and charged-particle sensors. In addition, the fuel for the craft is a radioisotope, which would complicate shielding should a Geiger counter be required. While it is still possible that the craft was made with low background steel, it seems highly unlikely: 

In US popular culture, it's often asserted that white people are more prone to commit certain types of crime that are "crazy", such as serial murder, child abduction, mass shooting, etc. This is often portrayed in movies, the most recent example being "Get Out" (which I saw last night): Here is a quote from the movie: 

The link to the source of their data is dead, but it seems likely that 1 in 3.6 billion odds are lower than a whole lot of very unlikely causes of death (struck by lightning while drowning: 1 in 183 million). 

Updated aluminum pharmacokinetics following infant exposures through diet and vaccination. The CDC gives 1.0 mg/kg/day as the Minimal Risk Levels for aluminum. Aluminum in vaccines in particular has been found to pose extremely low risk to infants. 

You can search the bill yourself for those amounts (that add up to well over 1/3 of the total $50 billion the bill allocated by the way) and read the details for yourself, but it appears that the funding is mostly disaster relief related. 

Yes, this is true. The 2014 budget allocates $145.8 billion to social security and welfare and $24.2 billion to defense. In the 2013 budget this was $138 billion versus 22$ billion. Of course this is only the budget and not the real expenditures, but considering that there's one order of magnitude of difference between the two budget posts, even massive miscalculations won't make the defense spending go higher than the welfare spending. 

There's another problem. One year doesn't have 12 months. The Islamic Calendar Year has 355 days. Considering a month of 27.21 days as mentioned above, 1000 years are equal to 13'019 months. With this we can calculate the distance the moon travels in 1000 years, which is roughly 28'000'000'000 km. 

Also note that most comparisons neglect taxes, which are lower in Singapore (maximum 20%) than for instance in Norway (up to almost 50%). Overall, it is safe to conclude that Singapore is indeed an expensive place to live but by most standards not the most expensive one. 

It was posted as a flyer, initially reported as seen on 18 Mar, 2016 on social media. It has a long distance phone number to Ohio, when the sting was operational in California. The San Diego press releases have indicated twice they found their victims online, by posting online ads. This is incompatible with the idea that the sting operation was a follow up to posted flyers. The posted flyer in question was reported nearly a year before the sting operation. Such a delay in investigation is possible, but highly unlikely. 

That said, the paper also contains a number of hints that it might not be a groundbreaking, or even fully meaningful finding 

Finally, this is a trope that continues to be raised. In 2015 large numbers of "firms recruiting teens for sex trafficking claims were raised", yet not one of the claims were substantiated or resulted in statement stronger than a few schools stating "some flyers for student work might be fronts for trafficking" These claims have failed to raise a single confirm-able case, but they did leave a trail which indicated that BuzzFeed may have paraphrased a Twitter parody account which was being believed as a real complaint as early as 2 June 2014. One of the claims puts text to an image of a letter from Vector the door-to-door sales organization that distributes CutCo Cutlery. Note that while the letter makes no claims about what sex you should be to apply, indicating you must be 17+, the caption distributed indicated it was "being sent to young women" from a group that was "drugging girls that show up to the interview". In short, it seems extremely unlikely that one would post a flyer to recruit; but, the story is good enough to keep coming back. For sex trafficking, there is already a large number of people who can be recruited that will not be missed (or at least won't be reported as readily as the average US school student would be reported if gone missing). 

So the report concludes on a reduction of 3% to 11% in consumption in 2100 or more clearly on a annual consumption growth that it is slightly reduced (0.04 to 0.14 (median:0.06) percentage points). Now, of course comparing a reduction of the consumption rate to a loss of income is comparing apples and oranges. The conclusion that the costs of climate policies are five time highers than the benefits cannot be drawn from those numbers. Other than that there are other aspects why the reasoning is false. For instance it does not take into account the costs of not taking action now will have on the time after 2080, where if no action is taken, the temperature will continue to grow (see the IPCC report). Further information can be found on this article on the Skeptical Science blog with additional sources. 

If their claim is that accidents increased, then it would be a supportable argument that the time to the next accident decreased, over the periods they wished to compare. I do believe they found a difference, but without proper attention to the domain of the sample space, with so few data points being covered, and with the large number of caveats and structured reasonings about data to be included and excluded, I'm not sure that their differences can be attributed to the control variable (which this being a natural experiment, binding it to a control variable is the hard part). The paper probably will be cited by laymen, and rejected as "possibly true, but we can't tell" by the scientific community. 

Low Background Steel is used in applications where background radiation interferes with the mission. Low Background Steel is not exclusively used in space craft. The majority of Scapa Flow was salvaged 30 years before Voyager construction. At least 15 years had passed, with a corresponding reduction in background radiation prior to the construction of Voyager. Voyager shipped with radiation sources on board, to power the craft. Voyager did not carry Geiger counters, or devices primarily designed to test for radioactive radiation. It seems highly unlikely that one would source Low Background radiation steel from a reduced salvage area for a space craft that doesn't detect radiation and carries an onboard radioactive electrical generation plant. 

The answer is probably not. Let's look at where he has his numbers from first. The 2% come from the IPCC report which states: 

As they say, the reason is mostly that smaller amounts are washed when handwashing. The average water consumption for 12 place settings is on average 83-121 litres (depending on whether all the plates are washed together or in 2 portions) when washed by hand and 20 litres when machine washed. They do however say that there's a huge spread on how much water is used when washed manually: 

No, this is nonsense. I found an article from The New Yorker, which explored that claim. They asked some lift specialists about it: 

TL;DR : No, even if one chooses to interpret the excerpt of the Qur'an as such, the maths don't hold up I am going to base this answer on your second source, as the calculation there is reduced to the minimum which makes it a lot easier to show its flaws. This is an answer on the mathematical aspect of the problem, not covering the interpretation of the quote. 

Fruit flies were one of the key organisms to cracking the sleep cycle. They have a fond spot in my heart, because I started real lab work (as opposed to student lab work) in 1989 with D. Melanogaster. Doubletime (fruit fly mutations have a history of colorful naming) flies tended to have abnormal circadian rhythms associated with the loss of normal DBT protein kinase activity. This interacts with the Period protein PER such that the balance between the two shift regularly in conjunction with circadian rhythms. The research was generally know back in 2006, (pg 56), and some of the work was done as early as 1998. The state of the art has probably progressed since then; but, the biochemistry of the circadian rhythm is known in fruit flies, and is known to have nearly identical analogues in humans. An loss of DBT in conjunction with the light induced buildup of caspase DRONC can lead to higher concentrations of DRONC in the cytoplasam. DRONC promotes cellular death, and can cause reactions in the cell that are similar to those found in Alzheimers (TAU buildup). A likely regulator of DBT is known (one has been discovered called "spaghetti" or SPAG). SPAG has a role in the aggregation of HTT (Huntingtin) a protien associated with Huntington's disease. Also a starvation of PER or TIM in fly larvae lead to 100% death for DBT-P (allele P of the DBT gene), where the proteins were destroyed by light exposure in larvae carrying these mutations. So two major neural degenerative diseases located in close proximity biochemically, a promoter of cellular death is related to light exposure and sleep, and a misstep in the gene can induce light triggered death. I would say that it would be possible to die biochemically from lack of sleep. However, there are many failure modes that might create "lack of sleep" and it is highly unlikely all "lack of sleep" scenarios would be lethal. DBT activity is related to far more than just sleep. It impacts 13 unique biological processes, including psycho-stimulant pathways. This may mean that lack of sleep may trigger other causes of death indirectly, even at a biochemical level. As for whether the "stress" is a factor outside of the lack of sleep, in science, there are many who feel that "stress" is used as a blanket statement to cover non-specific scenarios; much in the same way that nobody really dies of "old age" but the number of contributing factors to death in the old are great enough that a comprehensive examination of "root cause" is often not possible or practical. 

tl;dr No, this is only true when restricted to expatriates I think it is important to look at what exactly the report looks at. In the summary to the report, they state: 

And there's some more about it in the article. Of course you could try it out yourself with different lifts, and chances are that some of them will bring you directly up to the floor you want, not because it works but because nobody else wanted to get on. This might then lead you to believe that it works on some lifts, even though it's really just chance. 

This indeed says that the estimated global economic loss of income is between 0.2 and 2.0% for an increase in temperature of 2°C. Which is (from the same report) in the high-emission scenario going to be around 2050. It also says however that this is difficult to estimate and that for higher temperature increases, there are few estimates. Now where do the 11% that policies will cost come from? It's from another IPCC report: 

I'm decent at reading research papers, and the real proof won't come until it is properly peer reviewed; but, really it won't even come then. Many papers which are peer reviewed should never have been passed, and sometimes even junk gets published. To me, this seems to be an interesting observation, but one that doesn't survive the slant of self-bias. It might be true, but the paper doesn't seem to prove it. To prove it, I would prefer: 

The verifiable facts: On Feb 1st, 2017, the "Costa Rica Star" reported that a school district in San Diego performed a sweep which arrested 400 in connection to sex trafficking, featuring a cropped picture of this photo. San Diego released a press statement on Feb 1st 2017, indicating that "Operation Reclaim and Rebuild" resulted in 474 arrests state wide (California) with 28 children rescued and 27 adults rescued. The breakdown was
