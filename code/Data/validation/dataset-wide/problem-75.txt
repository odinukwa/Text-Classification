Get these three things, and more followers will follow. If only because you feed them, they will follow. Size really does matter: Scaling up! Once you have the basics (every step before this one), then you need to start getting strategic. However, this is the step that is most world/plot dependent. So a few plausible routes: 

The reason why I say these are your only two options, is becuase you do not only face the E=MC^2 problem (mass and energy within this sphere), but you need to remember this isn't happening in a vacuum. Meaning that air (pressure/currents) will still try to balance itself out, and if you are converting the air in a sphere into energy, it will suck in more air for you to convert as well. The same with water, the same with light raining down on you. It's an ever increasing problem that the laws of nature will try to correct and therefore frustrate your machinations. Seeing as you cannot destroy the energy or lose it, you need to find an equilibrium with your surroundings, otherwise you have a ticking timebomb with you are the centre of it. 

It depends on what your government is willing to do to maintain population. For instance, if you don't care what the people think / government has absolute power, you could simply kill off people when you're above your cap. However, I get the feeling that this approach isn't what you're going for, so I'll provide a couple other options. Sex ed Educating people about the dangers of unprotected sex and providing contraceptives is a very good way of reducing unwanted pregnancies, allowing all children born to have been planned for. While not significantly reducing the danger of overpopulation, this policy makes population growth/decline/stagnation more predictable and manageable by your government. Advance society Shalvenay touched on this, but advanced societies tend to have lower birthrates, mainly as children have stopped being necessities (for subsistence farming) and have become something more of a burden on parents. After all, it used to be that children helped produce food and clothes, but now parents have to provide that for them. Children are also an enormous time commitment, so for the most part only people who want children, knowing fully their responsibilities, have children. To increase this effect in your society, your government could sponsor efforts to develop underdeveloped parts of the world, if any exist. Once your planet is sufficiently developed, you could maximize the time commitment of children by making daycares illegal, possibly under the premise of helping children by having their parents be the ones who raise them. However Even with both of these options in place, your population will still grow. Just look at the US, one of the most developed countries in the world, where the birthrate is still significantly higher than the death rate. Unless every person in society is willing to limit the number of children they have, you're going to need to take extra steps. If you want to truly and reliably stagnate populations, your government is probably going to have to become morally questionable. Forced infertility You could develop medicine that babies are given at birth to render them infertile, and only with a government permit could they be provided with a drug to stimulate their reproductive systems again. The downside of this approach would be the immense resources required to manage these permits and the possibility of wealth becoming a factor in securing one. Brave New World-esque factories If you've ever read Brave New World, you'll be familiar with this suggestion. If your society is advanced enough, you could produce children in artificial wombs, making entire factories for children. This would give the government complete control on population growth with comparatively fewer resources. Overall If you use any of these options, your government is going to need to do a couple things to ensure their success. Firstly, census taking will have to change. Reliable death counts and birth rates will need to be calculated more than every ten years, probably at least yearly. Computerized birth and death certificates that automatically add to a counter is one option that comes to mind. Secondly, the government will have to take complete control of the world, if they haven't already. People cannot be allowed to have the freedom to have children if you seek to manually curb population growth. However, there is one final option your wise government can take if it does not wish to pursue the above methods. Nothing If your government remains in power forever, it is safe to say that if they wait long enough, the population will grow faster and faster, until food cannot be produced fast enough. This will cause mass starvation and the population will drop significantly and then grow to a sustainable level. Unfortunately, on Earth a "sustainable level" will mean that nearly every aspect of the environment becomes artificially controlled to produce just barely enough food for the now stagnant population. Foods that are efficient to farm/grow like corn, potatoes, and fish will begin to dominate markets, and many species useless to humans will die out. 

First is the surface goal. This is what you tell the masses, what you allow everyone to hear and talk about. It needs to speak to the masses. So if they are oppressed? Freedom therefrom. If they are hungry? Food for them and their families. If they are poor? Equality and fairness, so that everyone can reap the rewards of their labours. 

A house divided unto itself cannot stand. So create that divide in the enemy. Find out every possible division point amongst them, and drive a wedge in there. Stir up old rivalries, play on racial divides (but make it look like they are the ones doing all the dividing, you're the good guy after all!). 

While the media starts covering your ground zero, you go and start the same process in another town far, far away. Repeat the abovementioned steps a few times, let this become an utter frenzy. More and more people that are susceptible will believe they have it, and more and more people who aren't will fear they might be the next victim. 

You absorb the energy and use that to power something else. Think of it like a fridge. The chemicals are absorbing the heat and transporting it outside. So you transport that energy to power up something you don't need or want anyone else to know about (your own personal McGuffin (tm)) You bend light around the area you want darkened. This is going to cost energy, but it gets the effect you want. 

There are really only 3 social roles a society needs to be successful 1 - Farm/gatherer class these will be your society's food producers. For example, they could grow food and develop long sharp claws for harvesting, they could be gatherers with strong skeletal structures for supporting heavy loads, or even be photosynthetic and generate fruit-like things over time. 2 - Builder class this class will be responsible for constructing your society's buildings, maintaining existing structures, etc. They should have dexterous appendages to manipulate building materials such as wood planks or stone blocks, and should also be able to lift heavy loads and collect these materials (strong skeleton, maybe one or more arms solely designed to chop down trees or cut stone). 3 - Warrior class: these would be the members of society responsible for protecting your society from outside invaders. They should be resilient to damage, with maybe a tough exoskeleton or a thick hide, preferably resistant to temperature changes both hot and cold. Now, depending on how advanced you want your society to be you could develop sub-classes for each grouping. For example, a sub-builder class that can mine for iron ore or rare materials, or a sub-warrior class that can take on aerial enemies with wings and honeycombed bones. And if you want to get really advanced, you could have certain organisms with larger than usual brain capacity and a degree of autonomy from the hive mind, allowing them to learn and design new ways for the hive to operate (think engineers to design new buildings or scientists to design new weapons). 

In conclusion. It doesn't matter what is common or popular. Someone needs to be the first to take the plunge. So, I say, take the plunge. So long as the technology makes sense in context with your background world and technology, most won't mind. After all, there are those that lap up every detail from fiction where the technology is certainly nothing we know from today, like: Star Wars, Star Trek, Stargate, Quantum Leap, Halo series, even the 007 franchise (Each movie likes dreaming up tech & gear that doesn't exist at the time the movie is released). 

Question? Any and all questions should be posed to the nearest homocidal maniac with a fully loaded, fully automatic assault rifle (and I really don't care if that's really a thing, it will still shoot you in the head!). Sincerely, The head of E-Conglomo's R&D Division. So you'd better make me look good! NOW GET BACK TO WORK! 

Is it plausible as a mount? Yes. It's already been pointed out that ostriches are viable mounts, and there are even ostrich races. However, it's irresponsible to assume or assert that the elephant bird would be faster than a horse. I have seen no indication we know how fast they were, so I can only point out what is comparatively true. The more mass, the more energy it takes to move. This would mean that, like the elephant, it could be faster than humans, but won't win a race with a horse. It takes more 'horse power' to make a larger beast move, and more energy to sustain it. Not to mention we know little about these creatures. Would they take to (semi-)domestication? Would they be worth the effort to encourage us to continue trying? Would they need more care and sustenance than horses and/or elephants and/or ostriches? In other words, is it worth the investment? Would their top sprinting speed be worth it? Would they be trainable enough to selectively breed them for endurance, a would be needed in a war mount? Arguably, any creature large enough to support the weight of a ride (in armour) is a viable war-time mount. All it takes is time to selectively breed them for the most describable traits, and training them to be able to handle the strain and stress of it battle. So the question, really, is what animal is worth the investment to you? 

There are a couple ways you could do this: Option 1: Go far away Hyfnae's answer touched on this, but if you hide yourself well enough, and do so on a planet far enough away from this society (you said they only found most of the universe, after all), you can avoid detection for a long time. However, once the society's surveillance stations come your way, your activities will need to be downsized immediately. Even if you've hidden your labs well enough to avoid detection, if life on your planet starts evolving too fast or changing too rapidly you will draw more attention than you want. As a result, another option (my favorite) would be to . . . Option 2: Bring in more people What if your conspiracy included not only biologists, but some builders and surveyors as well? You could arrange to construct a surveillance station near the planet(s) you want to work with, and make sure that its leaders are fellow conspirators. Then, you would have nearly unlimited creative control on the planets around the station, as your planets can't be discovered by a society that thinks it already discovered them! Option 3: Change society The final option I can see would be to convince this society that "messing in god-like affairs" is not something to be banned, but embraced. After all, you aid that these immortals get bored of their immortal lifespans, so they build structures spanning entire solar systems. Your conspirators could simply pitch their activities as another way to ease the boredom. To make their case better, they could propose to use a lifeless planet and artificially terraform it. Where's the harm in messing with life that would never have existed in the first place? While this option, if successful, would be the best way to play God without fear of getting caught (society already knows about and agrees to your work) I can see how it would make for such an interesting story. However, I can see an interesting dynamic whereby most conspirators try to hide their activities and a few try to make it socially acceptable. These few would risk exposing the conspiracy, and might become the target of a space-age hitman. Hope this helps! 

Now that you have your first spread going, it will start to attract more and more attention. People will start ranting and raving in the streets. Trustworthy people, people that can affect a wider audience for you. They will tell their stories, they will say what you did and what they believe you are capable of. In their panicstricken state, they will not realise they are doing your work for you. If you set it up right, others will start to believe it's true. That will do one of two things: either they will believe they have it too, or they will start to try to preemptively cull those they believe that are infected to 'stem the spread'. Now that the one town is in utter anarchy, you need to: 

In case this hasn't been apparent yet, I'm a dark fantasy writer. So expect the 'bad guy' point of view in this answer. Your starting point: a leader. No rebellion, no revolution, no nothing ever starts without a 'visionary'. Someone with a silver tongue, that knows how to sway people -- the masses, preferably. This person will know the hardships of the people they want fighting alongside them. They'd need a compelling story to really stoke the fires of the people -- though not necessarily a verifiable one. Example. Amon, from Legend of Korra. Or frankly, Trump. Bad examples, with arguably dark intentions, but people that speak to the paranoia of the people all the same. Your rallying point: a common goal. This part comes in two parts, true to history.
