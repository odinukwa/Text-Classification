That sounds to me very like the encoding of a relation between two sets. By old work of Dowker there are two ASCs that correspond to such and their realisations are homotopically equivalent. There is extensive use of this and variants in which not just 0 and 1 are used but values between 0 and 1. I do not know of any special name. It is related to Chu spaces in computer science and category theory. One particular use is in a paper by Abels and Holz, in which starting from a group and a family of subgroups they build an ASC and can interpret the homotopy groups of this ASC in terms of syzygies of group presentations. (I give a summary of this in a chapter in my menagerie notes that can be accessed via the nLab. The paper is: H. Abels and S. Holz, Higher generation by subgroups, J. Alg, 160, (1993), 311– 341.) I know of other applications in a variety of mathematical and non-mathematical areas, but will limit the list to having one entry! (Some of the non-mathematical ones are a bit suspect methodologically! Edit: Steve asked for the reference to Dowker's work, which I forgot to give, so here it is : C. H. Dowker, Homology Groups of Relations, Annals of Maths, 56, (1952), 84 – 95. 

I learnt of much of their properties when looking at the stuff on microbundles. A very clear source for lots of that is J. Lurie, Spring 2009, Topics in Geometric Topology (18.937) , notes for course 18.937. Look on Jacob's website and you will find the course notes. After that look back at the Haupvermutung book. $URL$ For the open problems I have not that long ago seen a list from the topology atlas: $URL$ I hope this helps. 

You asked: 'can we avoid Kan condition by considering ALL simplicial sets and define homotopy to be an equivalence condition by ARTIFICIALLY adjoining all transitivity?' Why not do things as follows? To turn homotopy into an equivalence relation you have to not only generate under transitivity but also to add inverses, so to do that you have to form the free groupoid ... doh! This has been done systematically by Dwyer and Kan (and also by Joyal and Tierney at about the same time) by forming the loop groupoid on the simplicial set, cf. $URL$ Of course this ends up with a simplicially enriched groupoid (aka simplicial groupoid) and yes, of course, you can use this to calculate homotopy groups, etc. via the Moore complex construction. ... and yes of course, you can go back to simplicial sets via the loop-groupoid functors left adjoint $\overline{W}$... and low and behold that yields a Kan complex (and the fillers have the sort of properties you would like in answer to your question ... (although this is rarely shown in texts). This has an advantage in as much as it comes with a lot of fibre bundle / fibration intuitions analogous to those for the loop group in topology. These are classical, very neat and very useful! 

Here are some perhaps silly ideas. (i) Think of simplicial sets as presheaves on $\Delta$, now look up when a subpresheaf can be subtracted. (E.g. is there a universal property involved?) What os the subobject classified in the presheaf topos here? I am sure that these things are known, but possibly do not have a simple answer. (ii) One related point from Peter May's answer is that $X\setminus A$ should be the maximal subsimplicial set of $X$ with trivial intersection with $A$. The condition on the realisations is then a possible red herring. (iii) A final point is that if you are handling a simplicial complex (say a PL manifold, with a given triangulation) there would be questions of subdivision, and if I remember rightly some sort of regular neighbourhoods, and I think that this is geometrically more significant that merely looking at the complement of $|A|$ in $|X|$. 

Have a look at: Functorial Factorizations in Pro Categories by Ilan Barnea Tomer M. Schlank (ArXiv: $URL$ This will in part answer your question. It is worth stating that Pro - M only fails to be fibrantly generated because there are too many generating fibrations, and Chorny has worked with another form of fibrant generation see his paper with Rosicky: Source: Homology Homotopy Appl. Volume 14, Number 1 (2012), 263-280. 

This answer is perhaps a gloss on David's one. It is often useful to replace taking a quotient by forming the equivalence relation as a groupoid. Thus the initial situation you describe has the classical equivalence-relation-from-a-function form. This will work in any category with pullbacks as it is the pullback of f along itself. In a homotopy situation, such as you need, the analogue will be the homotopy pullback of $f$ along itself. This does not form the quotient as such, but is, I maintain, better (especially in the presence of differential structures for instance).It corresponds to the idea that was sketched in the question, but is natural functorial and so less hassle(<- technical categorical term meaning 'less hassle'!). It is also going to give results that do not depend on the homotopy class of $f$ and that is often important especially if you are thinking of the simplicial sets as being weak infinity groupoids or similar. I believe there are extensions to quasicomplexes but do not have sources with me to check at the moment or to give chapter and verse. This construction not only says two simplices in $Y$ are to be thought of as being the same but records WHY, and that is important. (Edit: Thanks Tom. I should have said 'It is also going to give results that only depend on the homotopy class of $f$ ..') 

For information: As 2-groups are equivalent to crossed modules, you could do a google search for representation theory of those. There is a thesis from Bangor by Forrester-Barker which looked at the linear representation theory of such and other people have explored that as well. One such is an AMS memoir: Infinite-Dimensional Representations of 2-Groups by John Baez, Aristide Baratin, Laurent Freidel, Derek K. Wise, which should be useful. You could look at 2-actions of a 2-groupoid on any 2-category, and in particular on 2-groupoids. There are links with 2-stacks of 2-groupoids, and that is a very interesting area. 

Category theory can be useful for certain aspects of (infinite) field theory, but really requires that you do not restrict just to fields. I am meaning modern approaches to Galois theory. That is not really field theory as such but intersects very nicely with that area. To see how category theory interacts with field theory look at the book by Borceux and Janelidze: Galois theories , volume 72 of Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics , Cambridge University Press. That goes from a fairly classical viewpoint to a categorical one, but the classical one is, of course, looked at from a categorical viewpoint. 

Rainer Vogt worked on this sort of problem originally back in the 1970s so check out his papers from that time. The theory involves homotopy coherence so you may need to check that out in his early paper (R. Vogt, Homotopy limits and colimits , Math. Z., 134, (1973), 11–52.) 

Depending a bit on your context, try $n$-gerbes. That should handle all the usual cases. Look at papers by Larry Breen and more recently Aldrovandi and Noohi in Advances (Butterflies is the keyword to look for!). 

I just noticed this from last year, and it may not be relevant now, but related to the comments above, on simplicial complexes with a certain type of action (no inversion of edges if I remember rightly) then the structure is related to Haefliger's complex of groups. (This is like the Serre theory of groups acting on trees, but here they are acting on simplicial complexes!) It is well explained in the book by Bridson and Haefliger as well as in certain papers by him. 

Any morphism, $f:A\to B$, in a nice enough category (e.g. with finite limits) will define a pullback whose two projections to $A$ give many of the features of an equivalence relation. This is of central importance to many parts of category theory. Look at ideas such as effective epimorphism, and its variants in the n-Lab, or a standard (> medium depth) source for category theory. 

There are several points worth making here. (i) One solution is to use Benabou's theory of 'distributeurs' also called profunctors. A functor F from C to D defines two profunctors basically $D(F-,-):C^{op}\times D\to Sets$ and $D(-,F-): D^{op}\times C\to Sets$. The profunctors from C to D form a bicategory. Any functor considered as a profunctor has an adjoint profunctor (I leave it up to the reader to work this out.) The n-Lab page on profunctors gives several suitable references, and a basic introduction. The Kan extensions question is then solvable as the 'existence' is a question of representability. i.e., you get a profunctor as the Kan extension but do not know if it has a representing object / functor etc. (Some of that is described in my book (with Jean-Marc Cordier) on Shape Theory: Categorical Methods of Approximation, (Published by Dover). PS. I do not get any royalties from the sales of that book so this is not really self promotion!) This theory also works in an enriched category setting, and in a derived form (suitably adapted). (ii) It is worth pointing out that in many contexts you can study the properties of a Kan extension object even if the object does not exist in the category you would like it to be in. This just extends the use by Grothendieck etc. of functors that encode something useful but may not be representable. (You may have some setting in which, say, a moduli space does not exist but there is a functor that behaves as if it was maps from that non-existent object to whatever. You may be able to determine the cohomology of the non-existent moduli space! Alternatively you can enlarge the category of `spaces' so as to think of the functor as being representable but in that larger category. This led to Artin's algebraic spaces and further on to the study of stacks, etc.) (iii) Another instance of the same sort of thing is with the use pro-objects. I will illustrate this with adjoints rather than with more general Kan extensions. The inclusion of, for instance, the category of finite groups into that of all groups does not have a left adjoint, but it does have a pro-adjoint which send a group to its filtering system of finite quotients. Using this sort of idea one can quite often get a pro-version of Kan extensions. (There are several instances of this in quite classical algebraic topology and algebra; again my book with Cordier looks at some of that. I only mention it because I know its contents, and not because those examples are the only important ones. There are many other uses for these ideas.) For the Kan extensions the idea is that you go via the comma category approach, giving a functor to one of the categories concerned, and of which you would normally take a limit or colimit. However the limit might not exist. If the comma category is `filtering' then the resulting functor gives a pro-object that replaces the hoped for Kan extension by an inverse system of objects that give approximations to the Kan extension. (Above I have used adjoints as examples rather than Kan extensions in the above, as they provide easier instances of the main ideas.) 

There is a whole theory of localisation within the context of ring theory that uses Gabriel's notion of quotient category. A starting point might be Popescu's book: Abelian categories with applications to rings and modules, if you can get hold of a copy. The theory has an immense literature so I will not attempt to give a list (do a Maths Review search with a long search time frame!!!!) A related area is that of Torsion Theory, so search on that as well. You do not make precise what areas of application might be of interest to you? Perhaps looking at the book by Gabriel and Zisman would indicate another (non-Abelian) perspective. That leads on to localisations in Quillen model category theory and beyond to triangulated categories, and .... Serre's classes also have applications in profinite group theory (pro-$\mathcal{C}$-groups), but that uses the localisation less directly. 

First a slight quibble: the Whitehead group is the origin of algebraic K-theory, and predates the general stuff by quite a time, so your wording is not quite fair to Whitehead! On your first question, one direction to look is at Waldhausen's K-theory. (The original paper is worth studying, but you should also look at the more recent stuff relating to the connections between that and model categories.) Waldhausen has a section on the links between his groups and the Whitehead simple homotopy theory. (I can provide some references if you need them. There are some useful comments in the nLab if you search on 'Waldhausen'.) For the second question, it is probably a good idea to look at some books on Simple Homotopy Theory and to take a slightly historical perspective, (also to glance at the original articles not just surveys). Whitehead's and then Milnor's papers released a set of tools for studying finite CW-complexes. The role of the chains on the universal cover can be viewed in various ways, but both constructions are part of the general idea at the time of making homotopy theory more 'constructive' and the taming of the fundamental group action in non-Abelian cases was a first step. The origins of simple homotopy theory are pre-world war II with Riedemeister and note that Whitehead's two part paper in 1949 was called 'Combinatorial Homotopy Theory' and was intended to mirror 'Combinatorial Group Theory'. This does not give the enlightenment on the 'reasons' for the similarity but may help you to gain some knowledge of the origins of that stuff and sometimes that helps to see what side alleys have been left unexplored and to provide an overview of the area. I have a sneaky idea that there is a K-theory for homotopy 2-types (and beyond) and that the Waldhausen construction is a way into that, but I may be wrong on that. On a completely different tack, have a look at Kapranov and Saito's article: Hidden Stasheff polytopes in algebraic K-theory and in the space of Morse functions , in Higher homotopy structure in topology and mathematical physics (Poughkeepsie, N.Y. 1996) , volume 227 of Contemporary Mathematics , 191–225 This links up the Steinberg group (which has a neat motivation from linear algebra) with a lot of homotopical and homological algebra. I will not say more on this as this is already getting a bit long, but do ask if you find these references useful but need further pointers. 

There are applications of homology theory both to Topological Data Analysis and other parts of Applied Topology (work of Gunnar Carlson and his coworkers in Stanford), via the CHOMP project to the structure of materials, dynamics of Evolution of Pattern Complexity during Phase Separation, etc. (The Stanford webpage mentions many more applications and they really merit a mention but I leave the 'reader' the joy of browsing around the links there.) There is also work by Robert Ghrist again on Applied Topology. 

The notions of weak equivalence are not 'the same' in your examples, rather they coincide on a certain class of objects, namely those that are 'cofibrant-fibrant' as mentioned in Arun's comment. Perhaps there is a more general question hidden in yours, however, as in both examples you have one notion of homotopy equivalence based on a cylinder or cocylinder functor and therefore feeling somewhat geometric, and one notion of 'quasi-isomorphism' relative to some functor, that I will write as $F$, to another context / category, $f:A\to B$ being a 'quasi-isomorphism' if $F(f)$ is an isomorphism. This is then a slightly more general question than yours in the context of model categories and is explored in Baues' work on algebraic homotopy. 

My answer would be that his insight was firstly that it pays to take what Grothendieck said in his various long manuscripts, extremely seriously and then to devote a very large amount of thought, time and effort. Many of the methods in HTT have been available from the 1980s and the importance of quasi-categories as a way to boost higher dimensional category theory was obvious to Boardman and Vogt even earlier. Lurie then put in an immense amount of work writing down in detail what the insights from that period looked like from a modern viewpoint.It worked as the progress since that time had provided tools ripe for making rapid progress on several linked problems. His work since HTT continues the momentum that he has built up. As far as `abstracter than thou' goes, I believe that Grothendieck's ideas in Pursuing Stacks were not particularly abstract and Lurie's continuation of that trend is not either. Once you see that there are some good CONCRETE models for $\infty$-categories the geometry involved gets quite concrete as well. Simplicial sets are not particularly abstract things, although they can be a bit scary when you meet them first. Quasi-categories are then a simple-ish generalisation of categories, but where you can use both categorical insights and homotopy insights. That builds a good intuition about infinity categories... now bring in modern algebraic topology with spectra, etc becoming available.
