Allow me to shed some light on this subject (turns on lightbulb). Brief Overview of Magic These powers manifest themselves any time from birth to the end of puberty. These magical powers fall under seven broad categories. Air, water, earth, plasma (fire/lightning), plants, light, and animals. Animal magic is tricky, because living things resist magic. But, many animal mages can influence animals, and some can control dead animals (this is called necromancy and is a big societal no-no.) The strength and scope of magic varies from individual to individual. But, these are the most common in order. Earth, water, air, plants, animals, plasma, and light. These magical capabilities are like the show Avatar, the Last Airbender, in how controlling magic works. However, in my book magic is much less powerful. For instance, an earth Mage may only be able to influence as much dirt as they could lift, and lifting this dirt would take about as much energy as doing it by hand, except you don't have to touch it, and it could be a perfect brick shape. No force is exerted in separating the dirt or material from other similar material attached to it. So if you were to pull this rock in two, that would take little effort, other than the force of pushing the pieces apart. Magic is like a muscle that is really hard to develop. 

The main character is reborn into a new world, right? Well then, whats not to say this has happened before? Maybe Europeans brought the names into this new world when they were reborn there. That would explain why some people would have European names. Other than that, you can just make new names up. People on earth do it all the time. 

Destroy Atlantis To keep with your comparison to Atlantis, you could merely destroy them with natural disasters. During th great festival of magic, when "all" magic users gather to the magical city and eat cake, their island is destroyed, whether it sank into the sea, burned, or was buried in the nearby mountains, there will be few survivors. Those who were are cursed, and no one will want to have children with them. They will eventually die out. 

As long as the atmosphere was the same as on earth, the sky would be blue. The light would still refract the same way as on earth, with no color change. 

In my world, there are many smaller worlds. There is an elite group of people who can create/change/wreak havoc upon these said worlds. (They can only make one.) But their word is binding, any official agreement they come to with their status invoked then becomes impossible for them to break. So a tyrannical King managed to capture one of these people, and made the world builder agree to create him a world. Note - This is in medieval times, but the new kingdom will by no means be locked in some kind of medieval stasis. This world is about the size of North America, with a sizable ocean surrounding it. In every other aspect it is like earth. (If the geography is really that important, you can imagine a mirror image of North America without Alaska and with the Rockies and the Appalachians switched. Because I don't have a picture right now.) The king can bring along a large army, and as many people as he wants. This King has all of the resources that a very powerful medieval King would have. He gets to begin populating this area with whomever he chooses, and has no trouble with travel between his previous domain and his new one. This King will also age very slowly, going from mid twenties to mid forties over the space of one thousand years. He is also a shapeshifter, and able to change his physical form to anything, but with no changes in mass. With these advantages come some impediments to his reign. Five sixths (83.33%) of all people born will have Magical elemental powers, which make them about twice as powerful/capable as a normal person. The rest are powerless. 

Assassination This hasn't really been covered by the other answers, but it seems self evident to me. If one king's son cannot take the throne until they both die, then have one King kill the other. Then the living King always gets his way. Issues The main issue would be the one house accusing the other house of murder. This could potentially cause another civil war. And we don't want that. So you have to use positions or somethi, and make it look like natural causes or a freak accident. That way, the one King is not held accountable for the other's death. 

Perhaps they built a giant, resilient complex into the surface of their planet chunk. They then create a machine that would harness the core of the earth, and use it to propel them away from he planet. It slowly accelerates, gaining speed. The energy shot back at the planet builds up in the center, until it all releases and boom! The planet explodes! Perhaps the aliens made the planet explode to release it's gravitational hold on your planet chunk. 

Before we begin, this system is created by aliens, and all orbits are on the same plane. These orbits are similar to earth's in shape. So, none of this has to occur naturally it just has to be stable for a period of about as long as our solar system will last. (And I know the sun won't live that long.) First, the sun is the size of ours, and identical in every way. There is a Mars sized planet just within the habitable zone of this star. On the outer edge of the habitable zone is a binary pair of what you can think of as earth clones orbiting each other at a distance of 3 million miles. Directly between the binary planet pair and the Mars-like planet there is a second binary pair of planets, identical to the ones on the edge of the habitable zone. Would this system be stable? Would the planets in the binary pairs be too far apart? Would the different bodies in the solar system wreak havoc on each other's orbits? Would life as we know if cease to exist? 

I have decided to change the numbers to make it easy on Hohmannfan. These two planets, for all intents and purposes, are identical to Earth, with he moon replaced by another Earth. So now the question is, how close can these two earth's be without being tidal locked? Since it seems necessary to say it, the planets must be stable for about a trillion years. 

This is perfectly plausible. Greenland is cold, and it is relatively mountainous due to the volcanic activity that used to occur there. As long as your area is a cold desert like Antarctica, your geographical structures will not suffer from very much erosion. Your valley could be the result of a colder age when a gigantic glacier covered the area. 

For my fantasy story, I want a society that knows the ins and outs of mycology. They grow food from mushrooms, make their medicines, from the them, and know which ones not to eat. I have said many times, if a society or civilization had the ability to do something that would benefit them, they would do it. So the question here is, how to make mushrooms a better and more reliable food source than wheat or other common crops used in Europe during this time? I'm open to making up a new kind of mushroom, but within reason. I'm mainly focusing on how to have mushroom growers common in in one area, or small kingdom. That means I can't have some super awesome mushroom outcompeting traditional crops everywhere. I understand that livestock mainly eat plants, so how do I make this a minimal factor? What setting would make it reasonable to have a medieval society whose main crop is mushrooms? How can I make it more effective than other crops? 

I would say that most people would not approve of this and switch to another system. They would buy things of real worth, for example, gold. Then maybe they'd make their own currency (which is legal in the US) and base it off this. Other people might just go back to bartering for things. I don't think this is a realistic scenario, though. What about the millions of people who save up for retirement? 

I have decided on my preferred method of zombie apocalypse. I have chosen super leeches. But I have run into some problems, I'm not entirely sure if such a thing would be possible. I have a few ideas. 

Maybe It depends on your creatures. If they have a hive mind, like bees or ants, then yes. Otherwise, no. The will likely try their best to survive, and while it may not be competition by your standards, there will still be some doing Bette than others, and others trying to do better. They may not be able to harm each other directly, but they can still do so indirectly. The strongest will go to the best places, and nudge the weaker ones out. Things like that. 

Today I woke up, knowing I would be saved from the destruction of the planet. Instead I learned the exact date and time of my death. My name is Joe Average. The planet I live on is part of a binary pair, orbiting a reddish star. In one year and fifty-seven days a giant asteroid will pass by my planet, disrupting its gravity and smashing it into the other. However, Mr. Benevolence promised there were enough ships to carry a quarter of the planets' population, only 1% has left! And my (nonexistent) ship was supposed to leave tomorrow! But, as fate has it, Mr. Benevolence is a liar (and a fat one, too). The last ships left the day before, but someone who actually had a conscience revealed the lies. They gave the exact date of the disaster, and told everyone that there are no more ships that can sustain life for the trip. 1% of pretty much any group you can think of has left the planet. Also, major religious leaders are gone. 1% of everyone else is going, and the richest .5% of people were able to afford their own ships. Note - Of the people left, there are about 7,880,000,000 people evenly spread across the two planets. Only a quarter of these have access to spaceships able to fly and go 300 miles an hour. Only a quarter of those have access to ships that can travel between the two planets, which travel at about the same speed. How would people react to this? As mentioned above, everyone will burn in about a year. Assume their society is similar to modern North America. Will there be massive riots? I'm assuming suicide rates will skyrocket, is this true? How else might people react? 

My Magic System All of this stuff about my magic system is actually necessary, because I know no-one reads links provided to them and because there is magic in my world. Brief Overview of Magic Magical powers fall under seven broad categories. Air, water, earth, plasma (fire/lightning), plants, light, and animals. Animal magic is tricky, because living things resist magic. But, many animal mages can influence animals, and some can control dead animals (this is called necromancy and is a big societal no-no.) The strength and scope of magic varies from individual to individual. But, these are the most common in order. Earth, water, air, plants, animals, plasma, and light. These magical capabilities are like the show Avatar, the Last Airbender, in how controlling magic works. However, in my book magic is much less powerful. For instance, an earth Mage may only be able to influence as much dirt as they could lift, and lifting this dirt would take about as much energy as doing it by hand, except you don't have to touch it, and it could be a perfect brick shape. No force is exerted in separating the dirt or material from other similar material attached to it. So if you were to pull this rock in two, that would take little effort, other than the force of pushing the pieces apart. Magic is like a muscle that is really hard to develop. Magic on a larger scale The level of magic described above is only about 75% of magic users. Everyone else is more powerful.The strongest people can do things like shoot lasers, uproot trees, be human flame throwers, make zombie hordes, create small tornadoes, cause rovers to overflow or to break dams, or cause small earthquakes. This is about 7% of the population. Everyone else is in between. Magic on a smaller scale I'll just make a list of some possible fighting applications of magic. Ice daggers, water whips, wind influenced arrows, starting fires, shooting small fireballs, throwing stones, moving stones, strangling people with vines, tripping up enemies with plants, scaring/exciting horses, and flashing people. (With lights!) These are of course by no means the only applications of magic. Magic Resistance Living things are resistant to magic, proportional to their intelligence/self awareness. So it would be easiest to make a swarm of spiders, then harder to make boars attack (your enemies, and not yourself), and nearly impossible to make someone slap themself. There is a type of stone resistant to magical tampering, which is found deep underground, near bedrock. Also, bones are immune to magic. Note - These things are resistant to magic being influenced directly upon it, not magically influenced material. A rock thrown by magic at someone is just as effective as a rock thrown without magic at the same speed. Some background Thunderbirds fly ahead of approaching storms, preying on pretty much any animal larger than a goat. However, they don't generally attack anything the size of or larger than a buffalo. So your buffalo herds are generally safe, with an occasional calf stolen. People often own pigs, goats, sheep, cattle, horses, and a tamed livestock version of terror birds. These birds are used as pack animals. These birds are just that, large birds of prey. They have no magic. As for their size, they can carry up to 1200 pounds, so plan for their size accordingly. Comparatively, a bald eagle can carry 5-6 pounds. (I'm not really sure how much they'd have to eat, so that can be an optional part of the question.) 

The best thing to do would be both. Snakes, lizards, and other creatures live in the ground during the day, when it's hot, then come out at night. You species could be nocturnal, resistant to heat, and be able to come out during the day if necessary. Being underground also helps insulate against all kinds of things. 

Have Dark Plants Have it be completely black. Black plants absorb more light, meaning less,is reflected to your eyes and it looks dark. Make Them More Efficient Make your plants have a more efficient chemical in them, other than the normal clorophyll. Store Energy Make the plant have certain growths, coverings, or just parts of the plant which store energy for later use in times of need. In animals, fat would store a lot of energy. You could have something similar in your plants, or draw sustenance from your fruits in time of need. Don't Kill The Whole Plant There are some trees, such as a juniper/cedar tree, which, when water is scarce, cuts off nutrients to parts of itself. That way, instead of the entire tree withering, a single limb dries out and dies, allowing the rest of it to go about its business. 

Where did this money come from? The only way I could think of this happening was if the US printed that much money for everyone. If that happened, it would devalue the dollar so much it would probably cause an economic collapse. I mean, look at Germany's situation post WWI. The country was printing to pay off its debts, causing the money to be nearly worthless. 

It depends on the kind of silk If your silk is larger, it will have more industrious uses. Especially if it is large. Things like rope, tents, and other situations in which animal hides or leather would be used. Maybe they'd make saddles or boats out of it. If it is smaller, and smoother, it might have uses such as clothing, or bedding. It would be like thread, although probably thick thread. Other uses The eggs could be eaten, and that would work as well. These creatures might also be eaten, or something similar. They could be grown for their hard hides, which ae like stone and can be used to make tools. Don't be afraid to implant other uses in your mites, to make them more beneficial. 

I don't think it is likely to not have developed gunpowder, but it can be uncommon. If this species has a very peaceful society, and little danger to itself, it might not find it that necessary to develop their war-making capabilities. However, while they may not possess weapons, the level of technology they have related to medical sciences would not make it likely to have only horses and sailing ships. You could make it post-apocalyptic, which would make this more likely, or maybe they were given the medical science by aliens. Or, their world could have very rugged terrain, and they use animals to travel on land. However, they would probably still have something more advanced than ships with sails. However, if this planet also had high winds above the rugged terrain, then sailing ships would be more reasonable, and flying machines would be extremely difficult to develop.
