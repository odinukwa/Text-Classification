Suppose the cycle class of an algebraic cycle has co-ordinates $(a_1,…,a_n)$ on the de Rham side and $(b_1,…,b_n)$ on the Betti side. Since the comparison isomorphism has to preserve cycle classes, we get the relation $\sum_j\omega_{ij}a_j=b_i$. One can also think about it as follows: If there were no constraints on $\omega$, it's just a random isomorphism between two complex vector spaces. The space of such isomorphisms is a torsor under $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$, and so the co-ordinates of a generic point of the space will generate an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$ of transcendence degree $n^2$. But the fact that cycle classes have to be preserved means that the isomorphism is actually a trivialization of a torsor under a much smaller group (the 'motivic galois group' for $V$), which means that you should have non-trivial relations between the co-ordinates. Grothendieck conjectured that these are in fact all the relations. Combined with the Hodge conjecture this would imply that the transcendence degree of the extension generated by the co-ordinates is the dimension of the Mumford-Tate group for $V$. 

The answer is no, in general. The problem is to find an embedding so that the minuscule character corresponding to the Shimura datum for $S$ induces the minuscule character of $GSp_{2n}$ corresponding to a decomposition into Lagrangians. In the affirmative direction, for most classical, simply connected groups (and only for classical groups, i.e. of types $A$,$B$,$C$ and $D$), the answer is yes; some subtleties crop up for $Spin^*(2n)$ (this is the so called $D^{\mathbb{H}}$ case), for which only the quotient by an order 2 central sub-group admits a symplectic embedding (of Shimura data). This is all beautifully laid out in Deligne's article 'Varietes de Shimura...' here, following Satake here. See also Proposition 1.21 in Milne's article here 

This proof was inspired by an idea of Francois Brunault and appears piecemeal in the comments to the question; it's probably not materially different from David's proof. Choose some $F$-basis $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ for $K$ with $a_1=1$, and let $p:\mathbf{A}^n_K\to\mathbf{A}^1_K$ be the map $(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n)\mapsto \sum_ia_iX_i$. Lemma Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are varieties over a field $F$ such that $X(F)$ is dense in $X$, that $K/F$ is a separable extension and that $f:X_K\to Y_K$ is a morphism such that $f(X(F))\subset Y(F)$. Then $f$ is defined over $F$. Proof: Indeed, we can replace $K$ by its Galois closure and assume that $K/F$ is Galois. For every automorphism $g$ of $K/F$, $gfg^{-1}\vert_{X(F)}=f\vert_{X(F)}$; since $X(F)$ is dense in $X$, this implies that $gfg^{-1}=f$, and we conclude by Galois descent. Corollary 1 $t$ is defined over $F$. Corollary 2 $t\circ p$ is defined over $F$. Let $L/F$ be the Galois closure of $K/F$. Claim The base changed map $p:\mathbf{A}^n_L\to\mathbf{A}^1_L$ is Galois-equivariant. End of proof assuming claim: For any automorphism $g$ of $L/F$ and any $1\leq i\leq n$, $$ga_i=g(p(e_i))=p(g(e_i)=p(e_i)=a_i,$$ where $e_i$ is the $i^{\text{th}}$ standard basis vector for $\mathbf{A}^n_L$. So all the $a_i$ lie in $F$ (and, in particular, $n=1$). Proof of claim: For any automorphism $g$ of $L/F$, we have $$t\circ p=g(t\circ p)g^{-1}=gtg^{-1}\circ gpg^{-1}=t\circ gpg^{-1}.$$ So the pair $(p,gpg^{-1})$ defines a map $f:\mathbf{A}^n_L\to Z_L$, where $Z$ is the self fiber-product of $\mathbf{P}^1_F$ over $\mathbf{P}^1_F$ via $t$. $Z$ is a curve (not necessarily reduced or irreducible), and $f$ maps onto an irreducible component of $Z$. One of the irreducible components of $Z$ is the diagonal $\Delta$. Showing that $p=gpg^{-1}$ amounts to showing that $f$ maps onto $\Delta$. But $f$ maps the $F$-points of the first co-ordinate axis of $\mathbf{A}^n$ into the diagonal: $$f(x,0,\ldots,0)=(x,gx)=(x,x),$$ for all $x\in\mathbf{A}^1(F)$. So it must map all of $\mathbf{A}^n_K$ into the diagonal, and we are done. EDIT: Here is one way to view this proof in a more general framework. Let $f:X\to Y$ be a map of $F$-varieties, with $X$ non-empty. Suppose that: 

I recall having read, some time ago, a beautiful and poetic opening of an article (or was it a book?). From memory, it was by Shigefumi Mori, and talked about the (mathematical) universe consisting of two hemispheres, a real and a p-adic; somehow meeting at the equator. We mere humans should strive to contemplate both sides and their connections. I have tried to locate the precise reference of this text, including some of Mori's papers, but failed. In fact, I'm not anymore sure it was Mori. Does some kind soul know which reference I'm trying to recall? 

Let $g$ be a Lie ring (Lie algebra over $\mathbb Z$), and let $U(g)$ and $S(g)$ denote the universal enveloping and symmetric algebra of $g$. The Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem (in the form proved by Lazard, see "Sur les algebres enveloppantes universelles de certaines algebres de Lie, M Lazard - Publ. Sci. Univ. Alger. Ser. A, 1954) yields a ring isomorphism between $S(g)$ and an associated graded of $U(g)$. I can prove that $S(g)$ and $U(g)$ are isomorphic as $\mathbb Z$-modules; this essentially follows from the proof by Lazard. Is this already known? 

Consider a subgroup $L\le(\mathbb Z/2)^n$, or equivalently a family of subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ closed under symmetric difference. I would like an algorithm that gives me a basis of $L$ whose vectors have as small overlaps as possible in their support; equivalently, a generating family of subsets with as small intersections as possible. Presumably, the sets corresponding to the basis will themselves again be as small as possible. The same question can be asked for a subgroup $L\le\mathbb Z^n$. I suspect the problem "Can one find a generating family of $L$ with intersections of size at most $k$?" is NP-complete, so relaxations are welcome. I tried $LLL$-reducing the integer basis, but the result is far from optimal. I get better results by $LLL$-reducing, randomly permuting the vectors, and repeating; but this is again doesn't seem to give very good results. I also tried to start with a basis, and applying elementary transformations "$v_i\leftarrow v_i\pm v_j$" to it so as to reduce intersection sizes. This seems to lead to local minima which are not very good. The parameters I am interested in are $n$ in the thousands, and $L$ of dimension about $n/2$. 

Irreducible representations of the symmetric group Sym$(n)$, and degree-$n$ algebraic representations of SL$_d(\mathbb C)$ for $d\ge n$, can both be classified by Young diagrams with $n$ boxes. Consider now a degree-$n$ irreducible representation of SL$_d(\mathbb C)$ with $d\ge n$, and restrict it to the subgroup of permutation matrices Sym$(d)$. What is its decomposition in irreducibles? Is there a nice way of listing those Young diagrams (with $d$ boxes) which occur, constructed out of the Young diagram with $n$ boxes of the original representation? 

Consider an augmented commutative ring $R$, with augmentation ideal $\varpi$. Let $\delta$ be a derivation of $R$. The example I have in mind is $R=\mathbb F_p[x]/(x^{p^i})$ and $\delta=d/dx$, though I would like statements as general as possible. I would like to know whether $\varpi^m f=0$ implies $\varpi^{m+1}\delta(f)=0$. My intuition is that $\delta$ maps $\varpi^m$ to $\varpi^{m-1}$, so somehow "divides by $\varpi$". I have found neither proof of the above statement nor counter-example. Bonus questions: is the property true for local rings ($\varpi$ is the unique maximal ideal)? graded local rings? Many thanks in advance! 

Consider a Wang tiling (given a subset of $C^4$ for a finite set $C$ of colours, e.g.). It's well-known to be undecidable whether there exists a tiling, and also whether there exists a periodic tiling. It's also well-known that there exists a periodic tiling iff there exists a doubly periodic tiling. On the other hand, for any given n, then it's decidable whether there exists a periodic tiling with period $(n,0)$: construct a directed graph with vertex set $C^n$ and an edge from $v$ to $w$ if there exists a tiling of the $n\times1$ rectangle with identical left and right labels and $v,w$ at the bottom and top respectively. Then there exists such a periodic tiling iff this graph has a loop. Here is a question I can't answer: for any given $n$, is it decidable whether there exists a periodic tiling with period $(n,m)$ for some $m$? 

(2) is basically a rephrasing of Krull's intersection theorem, which for us will be the following statement: Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, let $I\subset A$ be an ideal, and let $M$ be an $A$-module. Consider the intersection $N=\bigcap_{n\geq 1}I^nM$: for every $n\in N$, there exists $a\in I$ such that $(1-a)n=0$. (This might not be true. See Sandor's comment below) Let us apply this when $M=B$ is a Noetherian $A$-algebra. Then $N\subset B$ is an ideal and is finitely generated over $B$. Therefore, we can find $a\in I$ such that $(1-a)N=0$. In particular, if there is an ideal $J\subset B$ such that $J\subset N$, then $(1-a)J=0$. Moreover, $1-a$ is a unit in $B/IB$ (in fact it maps to $1$). Now set $X=Spec B$, $Y=Spec A$, $t=Spec A/I$ and $Z=Spec B/J$. Take $U\subset X$ to be the basic open $Spec B_{1-a}$. This is an open contained in $Z$ and containing $p^{-1}(t)$. For the sake of completeness, let me say something about (1). It is a general statement in algebraic geometry that, if you have a proper flat map $p:X\to S$ with geometrically integral fibers (this condition is equivalent to the condition you stated about the cohomology of the fibers) over a connected base $S$, then the natural map $\mathcal{O}_S\rightarrow p_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is an isomorphism. Indeed, $p_*\mathcal{O}_X$ is a finite quasi-coherent algebra over $\mathcal{O}_S$, and so there is a finite $S$-scheme $g:S'\to S$ such that $g_*\mathcal{O}_{S'}=p_*\mathcal{O}_X$. Moreover, $p$ factors as $p'\circ g$, for some map $p':X\to S'$. By construction $\mathcal{O}_{S'}=p'_*\mathcal{O}_X$. You can now use the condition that $p$ has geometrically integral fibers to check that $g$ must actually be an isomorphism, and so we have what we wanted. See EGA III.4.3 for all this. 

Serge Lang started out as a graduate student of philosophy at Princeton, but he switched to math, because he had "finished it", it being philosophy. Here's the relevant part from his biography here "After returning to the United States, Lang went to Princeton University with the intention of studying for a doctorate in philosophy. After a year in the philosophy department, he changed to mathematics and Emil Artin became his thesis advisor." 

I'm looking for a reference for the following standard result: Let $U$ be a unipotent algebraic group over an algebraically closed field $k$ (of any characteristic); then any algebraic representation of $U$ has a fixed point. Statements of Engel's theorem for the analogous statement about Lie algebras seem to be ubiquitous. I can also find the statement that connected solvable groups always preserve a line in many places (for example, Borel, Theorem III.10.4). Combining this with the fact that unipotent groups have no non-trivial characters gives me the result I need. But it would be nice to have a place to which I could refer for the precise statement about unipotent groups. 

Suppose that we have a closed embedding $G_1\hookrightarrow G_2$ of reductive groups (say over $\mathbb{Q}$), and suppose that we have a maximal parabolic sub-group $P_2\subset G_2$, and a minimal parabolic $P_1\subset G_1$. Is it possible to have two different maximal parabolic sub-groups of $G_1$ contained in $P_2$ and containing $P_1$? Actually, is it even possible that there are two different maximal parabolics of $G_1$ contained in $P_2$? Even more optimistically, if there is a maximal parabolic sub-group of $G_1$ contained in $G_1\cap P_2$, does that make $G_1\cap P_2$ a parabolic sub-group and thus equal to the maximal parabolic it contains? EDIT: As Jim Humphreys points out below, there is one pathological case, where $G_1\cap P_2$ might be all of $G_1$. In which case, all parabolic sub-groups of $G_1$ will be contained in $P_2$! This is the case, for example, when $G_1$ is a Levi sub-group of $G_2$. But Angelo's answer below shows that, excluding this possibility, the answer to my third question is 'yes'.
