This is more a remark than an answer since it gives an answer to the question that Greg didn't ask but I find it a very interesting and less popular property of Calogero-Moser system! Wojciechowski showed in 1983 that the (rational) Calogero-Moser system (the one Greg presents first) is actually even more integrable than completely. The integrability = the existence of $N$ lobal, univalent, functionally independent integrals of motion in involution is already a very rare property for a system with $N$ degrees of freedom. But what happens here is that there exist $2N-1$ global, functionally independent integrals of motion (not all in involution of course, that wouldn't be possible). This set determines the trajectories uniquely as the intersection of the level surfaces of these integrals. In the case of compact energy surface we will have the trajectories closed. This means that any bounded trajectory of Calogero-Moser system is actually closed. Isn't it amazing? 

Has somebody proven an existence of Zoll metric not close to the canonical one? (not by the "perturbation" argument?) For the Zoll metrics in higher dimensions, even on the sphere $S^d$, do we have any examples except for the analogues of "revolution metrics"? That is, do we have any examples of metrics without symmetries? What is known for Zoll metrics on the manifolds which are not $C^{\infty}$ smooth? Is there a book on Zoll surfaces that is more digestible that A.Besse's Manifolds all of whose geodesics are closed?

I am aiming for a "big list" of theorems using probability techniques to prove existence of some objects. And in each case, there is an interesting question -- can we find an explicit example? Was the probabilistic method the first one to come by or it was following the explicit construction? Are there any examples where it is proven that the example exists but its explicit construction is impossible? In wikipedia, on Probabilistic method, they do propose two examples due to Erdős: FIRST ONE. For a complete graph on n vertices it is possible to color the edges of the graph in two colors so that there is no complete subgraph on r vertices which is monochromatic (every edge colored the same color). Question: is there any explicit algorithm for such a coloring? SECOND ONE. The second problem also comes from graph theory and deals with a chromatic number of a graph: the minimal number of colors in which we can color the graph so that two adjacent vertices are colored differently. Given two positive integers $g$ and $k$, does there exist a graph containing only cycles of length at least $g$ such that its chromatic number of is at least $k$? It can be shown by the means of probabilistic method that such a graph exists for any values of $g$ and $k$. Question: is there some algorithm to provide such a coloring? I am not at all a specialist in graph theory, so I would like to hear the answers to thse questions as well as to see other examples which come from other branches of math. 

I feel there is some implicit idea here but nobody formulated it, so let me try: a smooth closed surface has no filling geodesic if and only if its geodesic flow is integrable What do you think about this conjecture ? For me it seems probable since integrable flow have their Arnold tori that don't fill up all the space: for example, for the ellipsoid, the picture of the space that a geodesic fills in is a projection of an Arnold tori (an annulus). All the examples stated above are integrable, and Burns guess is nice because surfaces of big genus can't have an integrable flow (Kozlov theorem, if I am not wrong...) I am really excited about this conjecture. 

If you read French, you should certainly look at this site : $URL$ This was first aimed at teachers and large audience interested in maths but on practice this is read by mathematicians themselves and graduate/undergraduate students. Lots of beautiful math in there! 

I feel that this is important that I answer you that one third of my thesis was devoted to this equation. :) I have two published articles on this equation (one in Russian though) and I am not alone. Please, contact me and I will send you my thesis with its introduction mentioning all research I know of studying this equation! You can look at my article with A. Klimenko here ($URL$ there is some bibliography. More precisely, we study the following family of differential equations on the circle : $$ \dot{x}= \frac{\cos x + a + b \cos t}{\mu}. $$ We call this family "Josephson equation"(not the best term since there is another Josephson equation in superconductivity by Brian D. Josephson...) since it models the behaviour of Josephson junctions. I suppose your interests comes from there ?... Here $a,b, \mu$ are parameters and we study the so-called Arnold tongues (open domains in the space of parameters where the rotation number is constant). As you say, it is indeed true and a remarkable property of this equation that Arnold tongues exist only for integer values of the rotation number. This "miracle" is indeed related to the fact the first-return map is Moebius. In our article we replace $\cos t$ by any periodic function $g(t)$, and some claims still hold true. Moscow School did a lot on that in late decade: see the works of Buchstaber, Karpov, Tertychnyj as well as the seminar of Ilyashenko, works by Glutsyuk, Klimenko, myself, Schurov, Kleptsyn, Ryzhov, Fililomov and others... The thing that was interesting to us, was to study the Arnold tongues of this equation, their precise geometric structure, I find the pictures quite beautiful ! The tongues, as opposed to the classical Arnold's picture for the perturbations of rotations, form some sort of braids... Please tell me if you need more information. 

I realize the abundance of the literature on this theme which is a disservice in this case, because there are too many formulas in all the books I've found and no explicit answers. Maybe someone could give me a good reference, the question is quiet classical. Let us consider a Bessel equation $$ r^2 R'' + r R' + (r-k^2) R = 0 $$ with the conditions on the boundaries $R(\sqrt{\lambda})=R(2\sqrt{\lambda})=0$. This comes from the equation of oscillation of an annulus with fixed boundaries. The question is to find the frequencies of oscillation in an increasing order, that is just find such $\sqrt{\lambda}$ that the system above holds. We know that the general solution of the equation is the linear combination between Bessel and Neyman functions $J_k$ and $Y_k$, $k \in \mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}$ so the question is reduced to ordering the zeroes of $J_k$ and $Y_k$. Is there an answer in a form of explicit sequence or, at least, how many first terms do we know? 

The answer to your question is YES, and you can look up the proof in our article with A. Klimenko $URL$ for example. The key idea is to mix monotonicity with Moebius property, this will suffice. First this was proven by Foote in a completely different setting (for Prytz planimeter!!) and then re-proven by Buchstaber, Karpov and Tertychnyj when they came up with the study of this equation because they were motivated by the understanding of the physics of supraconductivity. 

In general, the math I do use -- I do not forget [here I think I repeat everybody who commented above], the only kind of math I do really forget is the math I do not use at all. This is not as sad, because you see I don't use it. But sometimes I have this anxiety feeling that maybe that mathematics that I'm now forgetting could help me at some point of my career. Then I tell it to somebody, I make a course, I share with a friend. The good way to learn something is to make a course on it. I think, it is also a good way not to forget. 

Maybe this question is too trivial for a research site but there are so many notions of equivalence of knots that I am lost in literature. The question that interests me is the following. A knot is a continuous embedding $\gamma: S^1 \rightarrow S^3$. Two knots $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ in $S^3$ are homotopically equivalent if there is a homotopy $\gamma_t: S^1 \times [0,1] \rightarrow S^3$. If I understand correctly, if the knots are homotopically equivalent then their complements are homeomorphic (we can use isotopy extension theorem). Is the converse true or not? 

I take into account that lots of questions on Zoll surfaces have already been asked on the forum. But I will stubbornly continue asking. Are there any chances to draw explicitely at least one Zoll surface which is not of revolution? Is there some addition to the not at all explicit argument of V.Guillemin who proves that there are many Zoll metrics on the sphere (functional parameter family)? Guillemin uses inverse function theorem to prove this fact so no hope for explicit calculations... This is so strange, people do work a lot in the domain of Zoll surfaces although I do not find almost any pictures for this on Internet. Additional questions that perturb me: 

I'm repeating what was said above and adding some details for completeness. A little chunk of historiography: Zoll found all the surfaces with periodic geodesic flow in the case of the isometry group isomorphic to $S^1$, i.e. the surfaces of revolution. It was done in his doctoral thesis in $1901$. First non-symmetrical results were found by Blaschke. The reference is W.Blaschke, Vorlesungen uber Differential geometrie, 1, Springer, Berlin, 1924. By Korn-Licthenstein theorem (or simply by uniformization theorem) all the metrics on $S^2$ are conformal to a canonical one $g_0$. So any Riemanian metric $g$ on the sphere can be written in a form $g=\exp (\rho) g_0$. The space of Zoll metrics got people interested after the works of Zoll. After Blaschke found the metrics which are not symmetrical by perturbation of Zoll's results, Hilbert asked the following question: what is a tangent space to the space of Zoll metrics at $g_0$? In other words, for what smooth functions on the sphere $\dot {\rho}$ do there exist Zoll deformations $g_t=\exp (\rho_t) g_0$ of the standart metric such that $\rho_0=-$ and $\frac{d \rho_t}{dt}=\dot{\rho}$ ar $t=0$? His doctoral student Funk gave a necessary condition: $\dot{\rho}$ should be odd with respect to antipodal map. Victor Guillemin shows that this is actually sufficient using Radon transform. The methods are powerful, the work is hard to read but great. The reference is The Radon Transofrm on Zoll surfaces, Advances in Mathematics, 22, 1976. 

Thinking about my own question, I had another question that came to my mind. Take any real number and write its binary representation. With probability $1$ the proportion of zeroes and ones is the same and is equal to $1/2$. We can say that for its 3-representation and the representation in any system the proportion of numbers used is equal with probability $1$. So almost any number has this property. But can we find any concrete number and prove this property for it?... 

For this topic in general, I really recommend a book of Anna Cannas da Silva Lectures on Symplectic Geometry. It's wonderfully written and very clear. You can read a proof of the theorem in the book of Michel Audin: Topology of torus actions on symplectic manifolds. There are some more things here $URL$ 

Consider a big finite rescaled piece of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, i.e. consider a unit square with a thick grid. Famous Wilson's method allows to generate a colored spanning tree of such a graph in a uniform way by popping out the cycles: if the mesh-size tends to 0, then the interesting fractal structure occurs: one can read about this in R.Lyons, Y. Peres Probability on Trees and Networks. It is said there, that this fractal structure is not yet explained. Could someone point to me some works connected to this question, if there are any? 

I think, some less known shops need an advertisement. Independent University of Moscow (here is a link $URL$ to an English web-site) is a wonderful place itself and also runs its own bookshop. Most of the books are in Russian, but the choice is wonderful and the place is worth visiting for at least one hour even if you don't speak Russian!
