Cycling, roller-blading - fun, similar to skiing experience. Also perfect exercises for improving joint mobility and stamina. If you do some uphill cycling, you could also work on your muscle strength. Squats, deadlifts - I'm personally following Starting Strength program. Very good exercises for developing your legs and your body overall. Abs - any abs exercise will do. Pull-ups, bench presses - for developing your arms. Jogging - just to stay fit and develop your stamina. 

From get-rich-quick perspective, I picked up skiing very quickly thanks to two exercises: roller-blading and squats. Few more useful links: Building up your skiing muscles and The Best Stretches And Exercices For Skiing And Snowboarding. 

If you would like to develop flexibility while continuing to burn body fat, I can highly recommend Hot (Bikram) yoga. I have tried gymnastics for adults and capoeira to develop flexibility, but the fastest results I have achieved were while doing Bikram yoga. (I've heard that due to the heat you can push your body to the limits, but it can be dangerous). I have also burnt a lot of fat while doing Bikram because you sweat continuously. 

It really depends on the individual. There is some research into these topic. You are right about the "competition factor". There were some studies proving that Another reason is how our brain reacts to the environment. Just like each room has a purpose (i.e. bedroom, kitchen, etc.) and our brain reacts differently (i.e. prepare for sleep, food). We show some certain physiological, psychological and sociological responses. You can read more here. Similarly in the fitness environment, our mind prepares us for the physical exercise. Also gyms are usually (always?) designed by interior designers, where light, colours and even round curves contribute to your workout/rest. 

Given that the deadlift is such a complex movement, I often have trouble keeping track of all the things to do. One issue in particular that bothers me is the following: 

From watching this video here it could be that my forearms are taking too much of a load. He suggests to use neutral grip pullups, but this is what I am already doing! What can I do about my technique in future to reduce this problem? Any recommended stretches? At the moment, that region of my arm is a little sensitive to touch. I'll be seeing my physio tomorrow. 

It seems to me that my quads only really kick into action a little bit off the floor. Perhaps the start position of my butt (at the beginning of the video) is too low? I am tall and have rather long limbs. Finally, any comments on my deadlift form from the video would be appreciated. 

How do I implement this calisthenics stuff in such a way that I can track my progress? The great thing about 5/3/1 is that I can track progress, and I would like to be able to do the same with the calisthenics stuff. Edit: I don't do 5x10 on the deadlift because many people have advised me not to. In theory I should be substituting this with a more back friendly variation, such as RDLs or GHRs. 

I have been deadlifting for about a month or so. Just today, I did 6 sets of deadlifts, with the last set at 60kg (132.27lbs) at 5 reps. There is a video recording of me on this last set here. Upon viewing the video, I noticed that there is a slight rounding in my upper back. In particular, I was told that this rounding was caused by my shoulders being slightly internally rotated during the movement, and not keeping my chest up. 

Cardio: swimming - don't try to swim laps right away - work up to it. Any type of swimming is going to help your heart. Legs: leg presses, hamstring curls, and calf raises - squats are more effective than leg presses and hamstring curls, but they can be tough on people who have bad joints. Do these exercises instead until you are comfortable enough to start squatting. Having strong legs should help your knees and ankles considerably. Chest: bench press - start with just the bar. Have a friend show you how to do these properly. If your shoulders start hurting, this is probably because you are using bad form. If your elbows or wrists hurt, take a break. Core: hyper extensions, crunches, and leg raises - these exercises are super easy on all your joints but they are also very important - especially the hyper extensions, which work your lower back. A strong core means you are less likely to be injured when doing... anything really. Back: dumbbell rows, shrugs, lat pull downs - again these are really easy on your joints (when you start lifting heavy they can be hard on your fingers though). Having a strong back should help improve posture. Eat lean. Barring any metabolic problems like diabetes, your diet should be high in protein and carbs but low in sugar. Don't stress too much about eating fat - I would stay away from potato chips but steak and milk are totally fine. Take a break if your joints hurt: you can't make them stronger by hurting them and you will lose a lot of time if you injure them. 

I have never tried yoga, but some people swear by it. It won't get you big and strong but they do a lot of core work and stretching which are plenty beneficial on their own. A lot of people swear by it, but you will need to find a cardio workout outside of yoga.
