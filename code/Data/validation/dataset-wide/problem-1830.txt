Is there anyone aware of someone seriously working on thunderdbird to get write support on ldap shared addressbook? 

In the bios interface of Serveraid controller is possible to set the PHY speed. Beside this there is a parameter called CRC check which can be set to true or false. Knowing this, some questions: 

Unfortunately this is shown inside the terminal and I couldn't find any way to hit "ok" and then, of course, I get this message. 

We are working on a project which involves different hardware all hosted in a single rack. The machines are mainly IBM servers: 2 x206 (scsi), 1 x226(scsi), 2 x3400(sata) and another assembled machine with sata controllers. We are using several raid controller. Some machines have only one Serveraid controller, others have one or more controllers not always Adaptec ones. All the firmwares and bios are updated. All the servers and connected devices are under ups. Over the last 4 months we experienced several strange behaviours in our hardware. Suddenly and randomly we loose 2 or 3 drives and the raid volumes stop to work. It can happen once a week but never at the same time of the day or week. Most of the times a rebuild process fixes the problem, sometimes we loose the data. Very often we just need to unplug the raid controllers, restart the server and the problem is fixed. At the beginning we thought it was due to firmware bugs but we performed an accurate update for every machine and raid controller and there is nothing else we can do on the hardware. We have really no hint on what's causing all these troubles. We are starting to think that it's an environmental problem but we don't know if there could be something interfering with our hardware. Have you ever heard of something like that? Do you have any idea on how to investigate the problem? 

the process gets stuck on the installation of libssl because it requires the user input to restart some services (ssh ntp exim4) 

I would check the language setting on the ADR and make sure only the required lanugages are selected. 

Can you correlate any change in the MST file to any specific registry setting? I believe the adobe customization wizard will show you where the changes you make will be shown in the registry. If not, you should be able to find this pretty easily in the administrative guide. I would add this registry key to the deployment detection methods and force the clients to re-evaulate. Otherwise, 

Regarding your question of how can I force users not to install any monthly updates - You can use the following group policy to disallow the removal of updates for both admin / non-admin users. You can hide the "View Installed Updates" page with group policy as well. Regrading your second question of how can I force updates to re-apply if they are removed by users. You need to configure or be aware of the following moving pieces. 

It sounds like you chose to download / deploy all of the updates in the history of defender. I would verify the ADR definition only is releasing updates released or revised in the last day. There is no reason to download them all. 

2) Are the integration services up to date on the guest VMs? Try to install the integration services, if it is out of date you will be prompted to upgrade. 3) Have you reviewed the Windows backup logs to determine why this is occuring? The default log location is %windir%\logs\windowsserverbackup - additonal logs are outlined in this Technet post. 

Currently we have set up a test VDI environment that hosts several Windows 7 client computers. We are using the "Personal" desktop option and everything seems to be running fine except... The only way to access the virtual desktops seems to be from either logging into the Remote Desktop Web server that is hosting the file and then opening that .RDP file or Alternatively saving that .RDP file and opening it from another PC. We have several Linux based HP t5145 thin clients running "Thin Pro" that we were looking to utilize to connect to these VDIs, but I cannot seem to find a way to open the .rdp file or to connect to the VDI through the pool. The only DIRECT message from Microsoft I could find was here: 

I use rsync v. 3.0.4 and when I need to move something I use it with the --remove-source-files. I prefer rsync than mv. Unfortunately, when I use --remove-source-files, the directories are left on the source side (as said in the man). Is there a way to remove directories too once moved all the files? 

The title should be self explanatory but more in detail I'm looking for a way to protect the ldap from LAN brute force attacks. It would be fine to prevent password guessing by locking a password for a specified period of time after repeated authentication failures. It doesn't matter if this can be turned into a DOS. Unfortunately I can't find a way to do this and the documents I've found are really confused. 

I just purchased a license of safelyremove. It works with sata controllers too not only with usb. It's very nice. There is a full trial on the website $URL$ 

I never had experience on that precise model but generally the answer to all your questions is YES for every nas like that. Even the last question should be yes because the nas should be capable to rebuilt the array from the meta information stored in the disk and also because a mirror raid is not that hard to be rebuild. If you extract a running disk you can mount it on another host (the filesystem used by Iomega should be XFS, so every linux can mount it). Bonus question: If I understand well what you mean, the action is SWAP. Hot swap is when you can exctract a disk without turning off the device. This Iomega is not hot swap. Apart this in the recent past (last 3 years) we sold 12 Iomega Storcentre nas. We had 100% warranty emergencies on them: broken disks, bugs in the GUI, broken power units. We stopped to sell Iomega for this reason. I don't mean that this model is affected too but I would suggest you Buffalo $URL$ 

Bluescreen view only gives you a high level overview. In order to get in depth you will need to analyze the crash dump using Windows Debugging tools. Analyzing a crash dump seems difficult, however it's pretty simple. This Technet article goes in depth, but it's really a 4 step process. 

I am trying to collect azure diagnostics data from some resources in Azure on one separate subscription and directory, and ship them to an OMS / log analytics workspace on another subscription / directory. The account i'm using has access to both organizations, however when I am running the commands to "To enable sending of Diagnostic Logs to a Log Analytics workspace" (as described here) 

Your computer is most likely set to use a DNS server of your router / modem and that most likely points to a public ISP such as Comcast, 75.75.75.75 or Google, 8.8.8.8, when you try to resolve $URL$ with your web browser your DNS client is performing a lookup because it does not know about that hostname. (although you can probably resolve the IP using ARP) You can manually edit your host file as specified, or setup a DNS server to resolve that primary zone. 

Download the Windows Debugging tools from the wizard only instal the WinDbg tool. Launch the tool and configure the symbol path to use 

Open the crash dump / minidump. Click on the blue link that says "!analyze -v" to get more information about the events leading up to the crash. 

Assuming that you are trying to use the "child VM mechanism", have you made sure you meet the critera outlined? 

If all of those critera are met, I would review the the following: 1) Are the VSS providers / writers in a healthy state on both the host and the guest VMs? This article from Veritas will show you how to check. It's essentially these two commands. 

There is an azure-quickstart-template named 201-vmss-windows-customimage that will give you a template to accomplish this. From the readme.md 

I'm looking for a 4 ports pci or pci-express (not pci-x) sata controller with these features: - real hot swap support - no RAID support, or with RAID support that can be disabled through the controller bios interface or reflashing the bios My need is to hot plug/unplug one or more different sata1 and/or sata2 disks from different brands size and speed (even at the same time), coming from my customers computers to perform lab activities on them, like backup. I tried several Silicon Image controllers (3112,3114,3124) and Promise TX4. Everyone has issues: some disks are not seen or are dropped during the backup process while the Promise even hangs the host pc with some hard-drives. Adaptec raid (Serveraid 8s) controllers aren't transparent to the operating system and it seems there is noway to disable the raid. What would you suggest? Thank you! 

The orange led doesn't mean that the drive is broken: it means that it's marked as failed. Recently I had the same issue on a ServeRaid 6i: two drives disappeared. The raid was level 5. I put one of the two online and I rebuilt the second. At the end of the process I got my array rebuild. Of course it was not a broken disk but a weird bug into the controller or into the disks. Some disks seem to have broken firmware that cause the disk to deattach from the array randomly. 

I just purchased a license of safelyremove. It has command line support. It's very nice. There is a full trial on the website $URL$ 

I have a X3400 with 8 x (43w7598 250GB SATA 3GB/S HDD) set in the frontal bay and connected to ServeRaid 8K controller. The raid array works well but, even if I set the controller PHY to 3.0 (rather then Auto or 1.5), all the disks negotiate 1.5Gb/s with the controller. This sounds really weird to me because the disk are WD Caviar Black Sata2 disks (bought from IBM). The firmware is the latest available from IBM (accordingly to the IBM ServeRaid matrix). Any tip? 

You think it's originating from your PC? Have you tried unplugging your Ethernet cord and seeing if it fixes the network wide issue? I think you may be taking a too narrow view on a network wide issue by only looking at individual Wireshark logs, have you tried reviewing your switch and router logs and seeing if there are any errors? To find the source of SMB traffic that is suspected to cause the issue I would run a and look for what program is using TCP port 445 (Wikipedia also says UDP ports 137, 138 & TCP ports 137, 139) I would do this on both your workstation and on the file server. I would also set up some network related performance monitors on the file server to see if that is spiking during this time as well. I don't think it would be safe to settle on SMB just yet without seeing the same sort of traffic on multiple workstations. The fact that it is happening at a specific time makes it seem like there is a scheduled task , program, or backup running at that time. WSUS settings and Windows Update GPOs have caused this issue for me in the past, I would double-check those. It really sounds like the best solution would be to set up some sort of SNMP monitoring / NMS on all of the workstations / servers and their NICs. Quest Foglight and Solarwinds NPM, can do this. After monitoring SNMP traffic you would be able to see what interfaces are having high utilization during those trouble times. Buyer beware, this can be expensive. Quest Foglight will let you monitor up to 200 interfaces, so that may be enough for a good sample. 

So is connecting to client VDI only supported from that darn RDP file? Is there anyway to open that file with rdesktop or another linux alternative? Is there any documentation from Microsoft or HP on the matter? (I couldn't find anything but this sales document that assured me that it was "Fully Tested, Ready to Run") Thanks.
