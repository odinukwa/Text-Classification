According to La Tour Eiffel "Every evening, the Eiffel Tower is adorned with its golden covering and sparkles for 5 minutes every hour on the hour, while its beacon shines over Paris." 

No, assuming you mean Central Bank rather than specifically Federal Reserve. Lincoln and JFK actually had very little in the way of removing or even reducing the power of a Central Banking System. Let's examine Presidents (and one Founding Father) that had something to do with a Central/Federal Reserve Bank. 

An excellent article, by Peter Dykstra, in the Summer 2008 edition of Society of Environmental Journalists starts documenting all of the unfounded claims: 

Context During a Q&A Session at a Case Western Reserve University event, Judge John E Jones III gave an anecdote about Justice David H Souter giving a tour of the Supreme Court to a Russian Judge. In this particular story he was recollecting, Justice Souter said he believed the most important Supreme Court case was Brown vs. Board of Education. The Russian Judge disagreed and said it was United States vs. Nixon. Dilemma I can't find, with internet searches, that this exchange really happened. I am not, at all, questioning Judge John E Jones III, as he is simply re-telling a story that was told to him. Question Are there any reliable sources that can corroborate this account? 

Since blood plasma is the catalyst for saliva creation, our other cells do not have much use for nitrate - which is why dietary nitrate floats unused in our blood until we excrete it via urine. So yes, our saliva contains a component of urine - but one component of urine doesn't make it urine. 

No, those weren't mere farmers - they were militants made up of farmers. According to the International Rice Research Institute: 

Urea vs. Urine Urea is a nitrogenous waste - but it isn't urine... yet. Urea's molecular formula is CH4N2O. It doesn't have the sulfates and phosphates that urine does. Urine is nitrogenous waste - but it has much other stuff. Human urine consists primarily of water, with organic solutes including1: 

"A well regulated Militia" being the first part of the Amendment appears to steer the legislation towards militia/national guard - especially with "being necessary to the security of a free state" being right after it. However, "the right of the people to keep and bear Arms" steers the legislation towards individual rights of citizens to own/operate Arms. But since there is a ',' (comma) rather than a ';' (semi-colon) it is a little confusing to me that it should be in conjunction with the aforementioned statement rather than a separate statement in and of itself. So, does the 2nd Amendment actually give the individual people of the United States, the right to bear Arms, or does it merely give the States within the Union the right for Armed people to make up a militia? 

In some simpler terms, increased sugar (glucose) increased T Cell (immune cells) response. That may put a whole new outlook on honey being used as a medical supplement. 

The article first extrapolates origins of the 5,000 number. Bjorn Lomborg's 2007 book, Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming." The book said, there were about 5,000. What was the footnote? "Krauss, 2006." Clifford Krauss, a reporter for The New York Times, who wrote on May 27, 2006, about the conflict between polar bear protectors and trophy hunters: "Other experts see a healthier population. They note that there are more than 20,000 polar bears roaming the Arctic, compared to as few as 5,000 40 years ago." But he couldn't recall his source. He just said that number is widley accepted. As we all know, Argumentum Ad Populum is a logical fallacy. 

Most telling of all, is this "Qi Gong Master" bending 3 spears at one time (notice how he pushes the tips with his chin into his breast bone. 

One could ask the question, if local farmers vandalized rice research, why would they be regarded as the fastest adopters of said research? 

Pliable Wood + Elongated Shaft = Easily Bendable/Breakable Spear This video demonstrates step by step on how a Shaolin Monk breaks a spear. Look at how easily the shaft bends as he applies his weight to it. This is misleading as a deadly weapon, because if a spear did this during combat, it would be rendered useless very quickly. Listen closely to the 'hollow' sound of the wood hitting the ground in the video upon breakage. Dense wood, such as that of a real spear, does not sound this way. It doesn't stop with mere bendable spears. This video demonstrates a Shaolin Monk bending rebar with his neck as well. One key thing to realize isn't his many years of perfecting his mind and body in a temple - rather his hopping up and down to create a bending point for the rebar. Penn & Teller: Bullsh!t (Episode 109 / Self-Helpless) actually show quite well the breaking of an arrow, the bending of rebar, and even walking on hot coals - and how the average person can achieve this without needing to practice within a Shaolin Temple. The word of the day is Buckling. 

A healthy person, with no metabolic disorders (like obesity) could actually benefit from having sugar in their diet, because it would increase the reaction of their body's immune system. An unhealthy person, with a metabolic disorder (like obesity) would not benefit from having sugar in their diet, because it would decrease the reaction of their body's immune system. 

There is inconclusive evidence. The Cochrane Review found there is inconclusive evidence to support whether or not electric fans may cause an adverse effect on one’s health1. Citation 1Electric fans for reducing adverse health impacts in heatwaves 

In other words, only the sparkling lights will turn off, at random, and the beacon lights turn off at a certain temperature, or when the sun is up. All the lights were dimmed, as a sign of mourning, for the victims of the terror attack 

There is one serial killer that did murder policemen - but there is no account of her playing 'cat and mouse': 

In the long run, the US either finds a way to generate jobs for these people, or it will lose importance as an economic superpower. However, in the short run, the effect on low-income workers are not that great, and the gains for the overall economy, which may or may not trickle down to the low-income workers, aren't quite as amazing, either. 

TL;DR: The claim is true within reasonable rounding margin. According to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, the US House of Representatives has the 69th-most women among all lower houses. In terms of ranking among nations, the US is ranked 89th in terms of female members of (lower) houses out of 188 countries. The US is also ranked behind Cuba (5th), China (51th), Iraq (35th) and Afghanistan (30th). Thus, the claim appears to be true. Shouldn't we compare members in both houses, rather than just compare lower houses? Well, if both houses were counted together, where applicable, the US would actually lose 8 ranks: Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, St. Lucia, Bahamas, Grenada, Swaziland, Ireland, and Zimbabwe all would get more than 17% representation. Shouldn't we compare the US to something more relevant than, say, Bhutan, or to places were parliaments have any relevance, unlike e.g. Belarus? 

Here's the link to ref#5, which doesn't unfortunately, calculate the maximum theoretical height of a mountain. I guess geologists may mention these things in talks, but not in high-end journal publications. In summary: The 15km limit may be plausible, but it's unlikely to ever be attained by real-earth mountains, even the 10km ones that hide from most of erosion in the sea. 

There have been deaths following chickenpox vaccination, though the rate of death is 10-fold smaller than for chickenpox itself (0.15 in 100,000 vaccinations), and whenever an autopsy has been performed, it was found that the cause of death was from wild-type chickenpox virus, rather than from the vaccine, and that the patient had undiagnosed cancer or other complications (source: Wise RP, Salive ME, Braun MM, et al. (2000). "Postlicensure safety surveillance for varicella vaccine". JAMA 284 (10): 1271–9.; make sure to read the reports in Box 1) 

As an aside, this report compiled for the parliament of Canada mentions how election procedures can help or hurt women (and other underrepresented groups): 

Which means that on average 17.0% of accidents occur on Mondays or Fridays, respectively. There is a very similar trend in construction, using data from the Occupational Health and Safety Agency (OHSA), as shown in the Master thesis by Ashwini Bhide from Ohio State University (p. 33). Note that there is no normalization regarding hours worked, and the author states that "It could be due to the obvious reason that the rate of construction activity decreases on the weekends. The high rates (20%) on Tuesdays and Thursdays could not be explained." 

How exactly the different intrinsic and extrinsic factors interplay to shape real mountains is an active field of research. Thus, it's not possible to say exactly how high a mountain could become on earth. However, there are several limits to that. First, there is the issue of rock stability itself. Rock has a limited compressive strength, but quite a bit of weight (relative rock density is on the order of 2.5), so if a mountain becomes too high, the rock at the base will simply crumble or melt from the pressure. Terzagi (1962); Géotechnique, Volume 12, Issue 4, pages 251 –270 calculated the theoretical height of the tallest vertical cliff as , which comes out to about 7.5 km for granite. Of course, a mountain is not a vertical cliff, and when you double the Granite value, you get the about 15km in the OP (full disclaimer: I'm not 100% sure how exactly adding slopes on the side gets you a factor of 2, but I'm running out of time here). Note that the above formula takes into account the weight of the rock, which means that smaller planets can have higher mountains. In reality, these numbers are not readily achievable on earth. There are numerous intrinsic factors that limit rock stability - cracks, folds, etc., as detailed in e.g. Cruden (2003). The shapes of cold, high mountains in sedimentary rocks. Geomorphology 55:249, or in Schmidt and Montgomery (1997). Limits to relief. Science, 270:617. Furthermore, it has been argued in Brozovitch et al. (1997). Climatic Limits on Landscape Development in the Northwestern Himalaya. Science 276:571 that it is really erosion through glaciation that ends up limiting mountain height. 

In summary, if we can use workplace accidents as indicators of overall concentration levels of workers and consequently manufacturing quality, the data suggest that there is overall little difference between weekdays, with Mondays and Fridays generally being best. How come? It may just turn out that most workers don't get totally wasted on the week-end, but actually relax, and that on Friday, the prospect of relaxing on the week-end makes people happier and thus more motivated to do a good job. 

Or said a bit differently: don't use anything smaller than your finger in your ears. And if you're really one of the people that build up so much ear wax that you get blockage even without abusing Q-tips: 

As stated in the OP, English-language food guides do not mention mushrooms as foods to avoid (example from the UK's NHS). This doesn't necessarily mean that mushrooms are good, since mushrooms may not constitute an important enough food source in the UK, though if they were very dangerous, I would expect to find them listed. It's not quite clear to me what "Difficult to digest" really means - if the fear is that the mushrooms pass mostly undigested, then mushrooms are not a big problem. Quite a few foods seem to pass through the system hardly digested, for example peas, when the kids cannot chew very well yet, and when their digestive system is still maturing. The only possible concern is that if mushrooms make up an important fraction of the diet, children do not get enough calories (in fact, mushrooms are supposed to help you lose weight, something you're usually trying to avoid in small children). However, if you understand "difficult to digest" as leading to "feelings of being unwell", the difficult-to-digest mushrooms may actually be slightly toxic. Toxicity is measured in terms of amount per body mass, so the same amount of mushrooms that leads to a slight indigestion (or not even) in an adult could have more severe consequences in a small child. Thus, if you know that specific kinds of mushrooms make you unwell, you shouldn't be giving them to a kid. In sum, as long as you get properly sourced properly cooked (and reasonably radiation-free) mushrooms that don't make you feel unwell, and as long as these mushrooms aren't making up a large portion of the kids diet, all should be fine.
