A lot depends on how far an orbit you accept. This is especially significant because its an asymmetric situation - a satellite very far from earth becomes harder to detect, but might only be little affected by the extra distance, or the physical size needed to allow good angular resolution. Example - imagine a spy satellite used to video some specific part of earths surface (a military zone for example). Space-based optics are routinely able to be extremely high quality because there is neither distortion from gravity nor from atmosphere. Think Hubble telescope in an orbit some millions of miles from earth, photographing periodically when the orbit is favourable. Harder to detect. 

As other answers say, flight emerges due to evolutionary pressure and advantage. Since you can't mechanically prevent flight being workable, you would need to remove its advantage or have a recent and somewhat selective mass extinction that affected fliers. For example, suppose that the terrain was such that a flier wouldn't benefit at all from flying, for some reason, then we can expect flight not to arise. Or suppose all fliers became ground dwellers due to giantism, or only ground dwelling fliers survived due to volcanism in the very recent past that specifically affected fliers above non fliers (due to toxins in the air that due to climate didn't reach ground level)? The problem is, it feels contrived right now. I can't think what would make ground travel so strongly preferred as to completely remove the odds of at least some flier benefiting, or radiative evolution explosively reoccupying the niche. And global atmospheric disruption would have much greater impact than it sounds like you want. 

Assuming they have a means of technology, then yes they could. In their world nothing would directly suggest they cannot learn about physics, maths, and develop knowledge on these to the levels we have - gravity may be hard to discover (gravity inside a sphere etc) but chemistry, technology, thermodynamics, optics, quantum theory (and eventually quantum field theory), are accessible. So they should discover the other 3 fundamental forces we know of - namely the 3 gauge forces of the standard model - and other phenomenas such as subatomic particles, neutrinos, and fairly quickly, high energy cosmic rays. They may discover gravity by means of delicate work with masses in the lab (as we can) which would still work inside a spherical hollow world. What this means is, although they don't have sight of the outside, they do have what they need to make equivalent discoveries . One thing they would discover would be that there are a range of waves and particles that they can detect and prove (from repeated parallax tests) must come from millions of miles or more outside their known world. Multiple detectors far apart showing that particles arrive simultaneously at all of them but not detectably converging, would show a non-close point source whose minimum distance could be estimated ("magical thinking" answers would probably be ruled out if they had a decent level of science.) Equally other particles from their sun will show parallax, although millions of miles away. So they will see multiple sources, some too far for parallax and some not, a provocative finding. We used light to estimate how far the stars were, but they could do the same with any convenient gamma ray or other high energy source, or even their own star if their orbit was eccentric or their instruments sensitive, to tell how far the sources of these objects must be at minimum. They would discover their world has subtle changes in heating and magnetic/electric fields, and perhaps incoming particles/electromagnetic waves, which may also prime the ground for speculating that something(s) beyond it might be responsible, and would allow them to notice regular patterns and correlations. They would also notice shielding effects of these, much as we can notice lensing around massive stars and changes in earths magnetic field. They would be able to tell that these regular changes arose outside their world. They would also know from subatomic physics that it seems many particles have no electric charge (neutrons, neutrinos etc) and/or no mass or very small mass (photons), therefore near-infinite (or much larger than known world) range, and that they don't "fade" in travelling across their world, so they would be able to wonder where these come from and go to, beyond their known world. They might even be able to create in some isolated area, a magnetic field strong enough to focus particles in a circle miles deep, and notice they change behaviour around 12 km deep, much as we detect the inner core by changed physical properties of signals passing through it. They also have the ability to detect and create seismic shock waves much as we do - the reflections might be strong proof of the shape of their world and that it has a finite crust, with waves reflected continually by a curved boundary with vacuum. They would also be able to drill better than we could - if their world is ice covered, then ice is an easier subject to affect (laser/high temperature "drill"/microwave emitter) than many other materials and they may decide to probe it. 12 km ice is a lot easier than the same depth of rock. Core samples (well, exterior ice drilling samples) would add evidence. A core sample a few km deep isn't unreasonable and these people would find that as they get deeper, they start to find evidence of impact shock in the ice structure, dust clearly "seeded" by and associated with these will have unusual elements/isotopes, and other evidence of a violent external environment very different to the internal one. The natural step of taking further/multiple samples will show the shock surfaces are concave (seen from "beyond") hence they represented an external event or impact of some kind. They will be able to study impact structures in ice easily (as we can) and therefore realise these imply from their features and sheer size, numerous events of very high energies not existing within and therefore the impression of high velocity external impact and the presence of some kind of outer shell. Geometry will also play a part. Timing of electromagnetic waves will also show they live on the interior surface of a spherical shaped shell, even if they can't see it directly due to haze/distance/conditions. This will make sense in light of other discoveries. Once they realise "something in nature other than ice" is "down" there (as opposed to mythological places or endless ice forever), and that's it is complex and intriguing, the question how to determine what it is will arise. So if technology reaches ours, they could well be able to prove it from all these kinds of evidence all painting a consistent picture. After that - well, even without space faring, a curious species is likely to work towards getting probes through the ice, and even a small probe will be enough to show the wider universe. So overall, it wouldn't be hard. The main barrier isn't the ice, or the living on the interior. Its the difficulty of conceiving there could be an outside some distance below the "ground", and it might be a bigger/different/real place. Once that's challenged and evidence starts to pile up then its all but game over. I wouldn't like to be their Galileo though..... 

I'd add, gods don't have to be human-like. Perhaps their plane of being is simply such that its inconceivable for them to actually seek to destroy one another. They know where that would end up so they just don't, and won't ever. The question "yes but ifffff......?" can be left open as a teaser for the reader, perhaps put into the speech of some character. 

Elements with even lowish atomic numbers are quite rare in universal terms (hydrogen (74%) helium (24%), then the ratios drop off very quickly, and moreso for the many elements that don't occur in the common stellar fusion cycles: Source. Notice the next common elements are O, C, Ne , Fe, N, Si, Mg, S, all fusion products and none are "usefully" dense, you might as well store the actual supplies you need); Dense elements also aren't normally readily available. You generally need to find workable ores, then large scale mining and extraction processes to get relatively small amounts. If everything's transmuted the supply need to be plentiful and easily obtained; AFAIK they simply can't be compressed/stored to anything like a sufficient density to be practical for these purposes, compared to basic options like hydrogen and compact matter; They are comparatively complex raw materials compared to hydrogen and compact matter, you have to break them down before you can use them. 

I wouldn't/you can't. Unless you know something specific that will happen (or be heard about) in that exact part of the world in a fairly short amount of time ahead, all you can prove is that you have strange knowledge. You can't prove that this is from the future though (as opposed to say, from magical powers). 

In modern society the main punishment for a crime is either imprisonment or financial penalty. Even if you're a billionaire, a 20 year prison sentence isn't something to brush off, and a large fine may be a big disincentive. Suppose people could live arbitrarily long lives. Now a fixed term prison sentence (of any duration) can be shrugged off by many people since there's always another 200 years where that came from, if the person wants it. A monetary penalty can also be shrugged off, they can build up a new fortune some way or another in the next 150 years. A variable length sentence ("until no longer a risk" or "X strikes and out") is trickier but most crimes don't get that nowadays, and its tricky to assess rehabilitation. And of course most crimes don't merit death. In this question I'm sticking very close to current society, so the kinds of crime and punishment seen are quite close to today's. As arbitrary lifespan is now almost universal, criminals are becoming noticeably more relaxed about 5-15 year prison terms for assault, or 8 years for hacking and spam emailing, or yet another sentence for shoplifting, which lack the deterrent and protection ability they used to have. The Law Society or some other body puts out a consultation paper seeking public input how criminal sentencing should respond to this. Human rights mean that, as happens today, a persons health isn't a valid target for punishment, so limiting their 'natural' arbitrary lifespan or otherwise targeting their health isn't going to be allowed, and of course too-cruel punishments probably won't be allowed by legislators either. The expression "life sentence" is a particular issue as life duration is arbitrary and at the criminal's choice; they may not be viable any more, or not in the same form (also its too close to "imprisonment until person commits suicide": imprisonment until death may be technically viable but the courts may see it as unreasonable in most cases as it's too arbitrary and raises the question of death by what means). Overall they're probably looking for evolution not revolution in their response, if possible, but are also looking for whether prison and financial penalties can actually work as they have in the past. What kinds of plausible responses might be received, and what plausible ways could formal criminal punishment adapt to arbitrary lifespan, especially for less dramatic and "everyday" crimes? Update - the arbitrary length lifespan itself is "just how it is", so there are no drugs or medical procedures maintaining it to target, and targeting health wouldn't be seen as acceptable anyhow (as said above). (If it helps, I think an acid test for any answer might be the thought experiment "Suppose this was an actual formal consultation by the Law Society, in current society.....", which should help to separate relevant and even revolutionary answers from answers that don't really fit the criteria. But maybe not)
