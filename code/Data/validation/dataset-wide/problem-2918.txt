Maybe we want meaning, but Nature doesn't give us meaning - it is arbitrary, uncontrollable... That would be very unsettling and anxiety provoking, and would compel us to create a meaning for ourselves in this world that doesn't offer any. So, through the experience of being in a meaningless world, we experience the need for meaning. 

Here is a basic working definition of a law of physics from the point of view of a physicist. It does lead to several interesting philosophical questions, which I completely ignore (but am very well aware of). A law of physics is a provisional statement of an observed regularity in Nature. We formulate laws of physics to understand the world around us, and also to control it or act in it (not always: a good deal of astronomy for example deals with things that we will never control). A law of physics summarizes many instances of a given phenomenon in a convenient manner. For example, the law of gravitation summarizes in one formula how objects fall towards the ground as well as how planets go around the Sun. An observed regularity is something that holds in many, most or all observed instances of a phenomenon. A law is always provisional in the sense that a more encompassing or more precise statement of a regularity may have to be made later, given more observations. The laws of physics are usually numerical, holding between observable quantities that can be measured, so that the laws take a precise, mathematical form. However, there can be individual instances of measurements that do not exactly conform to the mathematical law at hand: there can be errors due to the measurement equipment or procedure, or fundamental uncertainty as in the case of quantum mechanics. This gives a statistical character to the laws of physics, and it is usually required to estimate the uncertainty in the measurements. A very basic example, but one that is IMHO worthwhile keeping in mind as a good image of a law of physics, would be the following picture, where we have observed a number of data points, and plotted the line (model/law) that bests fits these observations. It shows what the law/model is: the line, i.e. 2 coefficients a and b in a formula y = ax + b. This line summarizes the data points, it is the regularity/invariant underlying the phenomenon. It also allows interpolation and prediction to calculate unmeasured values of y for values of x. Finally, it shows the notion of error in measurement, as many actual points lie close to the line, but not exactly on it. 

We need to first get up-to-date on the topic of sadness, therefore I would suggest this book: "The Anatomy of Melancholy, What it is: With all the Kinds, Causes, Symptomes, Prognostickes, and Several Cures of it. In Three Maine Partitions with their several Sections, Members, and Subsections. Philosophically, Medicinally, Historically, Opened and Cut Up)" by Robert Burton (1621). With later updates, revisions and reprints. (Usually just referred to as "The Anatomy of Melancholy", any good library will have it) After you read Burton's book, you will certainly know what it means to be sad. Then we would read a selection on existentialism. Maybe we could read Gyorgy Lukacs on Existentialism. Lukacs himself didn't think much of existentialism. You can find his essay on the internet. I don't think existentialism will help us much with our sadness, it may even make it worse!! However, there are some people who can truly commit to something so much that they rarely get sad. Then again, we may just be expecting too much from life. Everyone smiles in the advertisements on TV and on the net so we think everyone is happy all the time. But remember, the people smiling are actors, and a director is yelling at them to smile for the camera! This pretty much leaves us with the Buddha who said that this world is suffering, it is all about suffering, and then he laid out the eightfold path as the way to deal with the problem. But enlightenment requires us to let go of attachments. It is very, very hard for all people, much less for Westerners, to let go of attachments. Especially the attachment we have to our own ego. Nevertheless, the Buddha did some very profound thinking on this topic, and it is probably worth studying him. I don't mean to slight the other religions or belief systems. I mention Buddhism because it puts the issue front and center it seems to me. NB: The Wikipedia for The Anatomy of Melancholy quotes a literary critic as saying that the Anatomy "survives among the cognoscenti." And that is certainly true. Those in the know will have read this book. 

You have to ask, given your understanding of sociology and given how well you've otherwise arranged society, what the likelihood is that the mass surveillance will be abused at the expense of those worst off. Then, you have to consider what the benefit will be to those worst off. Imagine this from such a perspective, and make the "selfish" choice. Personally, I feel that some version of effective encryption will, from this point forward, always be necessary, even in the most ideal society one can realistically imagine. Until we reach such an ideal society, I think the US Constitution provides pretty good approximations of the boundary line, and that the current extent of US surveillance is unconstitutional. I particularly feel that metadata is more sensitive than judges have yet understood. But, that's all me answering the question as a realist, and I think of Rawlsian philosophy as an idealistic one... I'm not sure how much more surveillance I would abide in a more ideal world, but I think it would be more. 

I'm not sure if this will satisfy you, but it's another (rather obvious) way to think about it -- a line is some function the derivative of which is a constant, or the second derivative of which is zero. When you look at the collection of infinitessimal line segments you described earlier, does each one have the same slope -- the same tangent -- as the ones before and after it? I guess the concepts of slope and tangent are also based in the concept of the line, but this still appeals to my intuitions. It's not altogether absurd to call a circle a "line" that is biased towards a center. In this case, every infinitessimal segment follows a pattern set by the one before it, where its "path" changes according to that pattern, that bias towards the center. A "straight" line is one with no such bias -- where every line segment is just a transposition of the last, with no transformation. My ideas are starting to bleed into one another, but I guess that's fine, because it doesn't seem like you're looking for an answer, so much as scratching of an itch. Hope I helped. 

Satcitananda. Roughly: truth, consciousness, bliss. That's it. Not surprisingly however, Satcitananda has a Wikipedia! And I would particularly draw your attention to the Discussion section of the Wikipedia article. $URL$ I was trying to get across that it is something realized rather than learned through definitions (as we tend to do in the west). Brahman "is" indescribable, unitary, ultimate (wiki, under the Vedanta section). I realize that what I have written here does not answer the original question as asked, and again I would point to the discussion section I mentioned above. 

What you say reminds me of Fichte. Not exactly Fichte, but in the "neighborhood" of Fichte. $URL$ Note as you read the article when you come to "second order images...." Fichte: Gentlemen, think the wall, now, gentlemen, think the one who thinks the wall.... This seems to run to an infinite regress. However, and now we move past Fichte I think, there is this intuitive feeling that this "you" is always available to us, this extra "you", if you will. Frederick Copleston, a well known Anglo historian of philosophy, took note of this extra "you" (like an always available extra) and he had something interesting to say about it but I can't remember exactly what it was! If I can find it I will update this post. I don't know if any of this will help you, but my intuition ! tells me you might benefit from the Andy Bluden article above. I think somehow something in Fichte might further stimulate your thinking. 

I am aware of two major modes of reasoning used for justification of belief: deductive and inductive. Whereas physics relies on induction, mathematics seems to rely exclusively on deductive inference, which ensures the soundness of its conclusions. Is that correct? Are there other modes of inference used in mathematics? Also, to be precise, what I am after here are the admissible modes of inference used for justification in the final product of mathematics, not the types of inferences mathematicians use in their daily work to generate mathematics. For inductive reasoning, what I have in mind here is what is explaining in this entry of the SEP. (if there is nothing in mathematics but deduction, mathematics is an extension of logic, and there is no other way to see the situation) 

Sometimes in physics, the mathematics leads to "un-physical solutions or terms", that are readily tossed by the physicist. For example, when deriving absorption and emission rates for via quantized light-atom interactions in quantum optics class, we toss out 2 terms from the Hamiltonian, on the grounds that they don't correspond to any observed physical process: 

Austria (Vienna) to me is the classic case study here. One of the characters of great interest, Karl Lueger. This man knew how to get elected. He knew how to appeal to the petit bourgeoisie. There is very little new under the sun. It's just amazing how this one city in the late 19th Century, early 20th century continues to have its influence on the world. The number of imporant figures who passed through Vienna before , and in the early years after, WWI is astounding. Lenin was there. Hitler. They all got an education of sorts in Vienna. But this is just the tip of the iceberg of the figures who passed through. Even today I watch Austria for trends, because it is small, and it can change quickly. What I think we have here is a limitation of consciousness. A circle is drawn, permissible news is inside the circle, and many times a busy public has no idea what is outside the circle, unless they put in an effort. When we speak of the press and propaganda, usually I think of a central authority which can control the content. Of key importance is what is left out. On the other hand, the major players in the commercial press are also centralized today. The fake news talk came from Trump I think. I am sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong. Trump got his education from a man named Roy Cohn, and to know the great and highly unusual character and lawyer Cohn is to know Trump. Cohn was capable of creating a storm of contradictions, one simply could not penetrate it. And it worked, until it didn't work, but for a long time it worked for Cohn. Is the American press good? Is it doing it's job for the American public? No, of course not. But it is not as bad as Trump says it is. The normal operation of the American press is to titillate the public but not to really rock the boat. We don't want people to stop shopping. So fake news seems to be a charge, like an indictment of the press, but it sticks at least a little bit because there is some truth to it. Who is the philosopher here? Probably Baudrillard. The news is written, for the most part, before it happens. The story is ready before the event even happens. We also have Marcuse, the totally administered society and individual. After saying all this, however, it must be pointed out that many people who care to find the truth (or something close to it) can find it. They may not want to find it. It may not all come out at one time, but they can find it. And finally, regarding America, we are a big country. It is just hard to fool everybody all the time. 

The value of what is to be understood, whether it is a lesson, emotion, or bare fact. Its effectiveness in being understood by its intended audience. This is a tough one, in that I certainly appreciate a lot of music that I can't say I fully understand -- but perhaps the intent was for me to understand an emotion, or the effect of a certain sound or technique... Perhaps there were many intentions, and I have appreciated some but not others. I also know that much great art is written so that it will be misunderstood -- see "The Road Not Taken," or the passage with the "must haves" in "The Great Gatsby." I don't want to say that the quality of the art is a function of its impact, or how much its audience appreciates it. But I'm relatively satisfied with the way I've phrased this -- "its effectiveness in being understood by its intended audience." The uniqueness of that effort -- if I can have an audience understand a message that it could not otherwise easily understand, I may have accomplished something greater than if I had reiterated a thought that my audience already understood. Other factors. I really don't know. I think it's subjective at the end of the day, but if it's a function, it certainly isn't this simple. 

Loosely certain types of idealism, but with your last sentence you move into Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, even the pagan occult (West European variety); and Neoplatonism. In the so-called postmodern world, you are likely to get a jumble of the latter two, or even all of the above. "The Will" is the key to the two named philosophers and the pagan occult, whereas with Neoplatonism it is a communication, a calling down, and a back and forth. (I don't consider the West Euro. pagan occult, itself, to be philosophy, but others may disagree). Now, strictly speaking, Neoplatonism should not be lumped together with matters of The Will and West European occult, but I include it because you will find Neoplatonist ideas mixed in with them in later books. What is Neoplatonism? Neoplatonism, Biggs, Internet Archive: $URL$ [e.g. In the Roman Catholic Church, the saying is that a sacrament brings about what it signifies. E.g. The holy Eucharist is not merely a sign of grace, but it brings about more grace for those who receive it, and it does this each time they receive it. This has a very Augustinian-Neoplatonist feeling to me, rather than the usual Aristotle-Thomism.]. The key thing for you to keep in mind is that when you get into your last paragraph you will be in a world of jumble and frustration, especially with modern books. I will also put down E.R. Dodds: $URL$ Dodds was a master classicist, but I can't speak for his paranormal ideas, I just don't know. Finally, back in the day, Duke Univ. did some scientific research on the paranormal. I hope I have understood your question; it has been difficult for me to find an exact fit for you. I will also leave you this on A.N. Whitehead, because I can see the possibility that it may interest you. $URL$ P.S. Think of West European occult as being "from below", and Neoplatonism "from above". But with Neoplatonism there can be a kind of communication back and forth. 

It is greater than God and more evil than the devil. The poor have it, the rich need it and if you eat it you’ll die. What is it? ... I hate riddles like that. Because the whole point of a riddle is "fit something into this odd set of rules," and there isn't anything that fits into this odd set of rules, and the only answer is to give up. And that's supposed to be clever. So... yes, it's easy for people to think that "nothing" is an affirmative type of thing... But if you're worried about that, just be conscious of what you're saying when you say it, and what others are saying when you say it. I think that actual problems with the word "nothing" will be rare, but hey, you might catch some weird issues. 

I personally define art as any attempt to be understood. The value of art -- I suppose, the quality -- may be some function of 

First of all: anything with properties necessarily "exists." The question is a specific type of existence -- in actuality, as opposed to as an idea only. The idea behind the ontological was that, if you could conceive of God, then he existed as an idea, and one of the properties that idea would have is that it also existed in actuality. It's a cute argument, but you really should be able to tell why it doesn't make sense; "existing" is not one of the parts of an idea, it's an idea, that's just what it is. It's as though you're talking about people; and you say that this person has the property of having blonde hair, and this person has the property of having dark skin, and this person has the property of being a television. No, people can't have that property. The same way ideas can't have the property of "existing" in actuality -- although they might refer to something that does. "Existing," isn't a property. If you want to talk about it as though it's a property, it isn't a regular property, like the ones that can be added and taken away from things -- you can't take an idea and turn it into a real thing, or a real thing and turn it into an idea (although you can make physical embodiments of ideas, and break them). It could not be added to or removed from a bundle of other properties. It would describe that bundle, and whether that bundle refers to a thing in reality, or to an idea. But it wouldn't be a part of that thing. Existence is not proper to me. I exist, and then everything else about me follows that in some inferior way. Maybe you want to call that a property, but it's clearly different from all the others. It seems to me different enough, at least, that it's not something that can be ascribed to an idea, such that God, if he can be conceived, can magically transubstantiate from an idea to a real thing. Alternatively, you can say that, when you're conceiving of that greater than which nothing can be conceived, and one of the properties you think of it having is that it exists, then great, you're thinking of it existing. But it's still just a thought -- it's just, you think of it as something that has the property of existing. You can't actually give it that property by conceiving of it as having that property. I could conceive of a Maserati that had the property of being in my driveway, if you want to call that a property, but I can't actually give the Maserati that property; I can only think of it as having that property. An idea can't have "existence" just given to it the way it can have "red" given to it. (Woah, this went a lot longer than I intended, sorry).
