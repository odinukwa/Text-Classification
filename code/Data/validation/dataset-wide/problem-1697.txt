I am having a very hard time getting clear about receive connectors in Exchange 2010, which I have unhappily inherited. I have read a lot of articles and books, but nothing presents the information I need in a clear way, and some of the articles are conflicting, which is expected but doesn't make this any easier. The reason for asking these questions together is that some of them impact others, and if asked separately they would probably not make clear what I need to accomplish. My Exchange server is Hub role internet-facing. There is no edge or filter between it and the outside. I recently implemented split DNS, and I want to know if the "Server" and "Fqdn" attributes should be changed to the public DNS name for my mail server, as in "mail.domain.com". The "Name" attribute is only a label for the connector which shows in the Exchange Management Console. The "Identity" attribute is related to the GUID. Again, it currently shows as \<"Name" attribute>. The question is whether I can change that to the public DNS name for my mail server, "mail.domain.com". I need to know if the DistinguishedName attribute can or should also be changed. Some of my existing connectors have a value for the "DistinguishedName" attribute which reads "CN=,CN=SMTP Receive Connectors,CN=Protocols,CN=,CN=Servers,CN=Exchange Administrative Group,(...),CN=Administrative Groups,CN=First Organization,CN=Microsoft Exchange,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=,DC=". I know that at one point a migration was done from Exchange 2003, and that it was not cleaned up, so to speak. I need to know if I can simply remove connectors with that value, or whether they need to be replaced with other ones. The "Default" connector, as I understand it, receives email from the internet on port 25 from any IP (0.0.0.0-255.255.255.255). I need to understand how AuthMechanism, RequireTLS and PermissionGroups relate to each other, and where RequireTLS is appropriate, as in I don't want to lose email by forcing TLS. I want to configure TLS. I need to understand where "opportunistic" vs "mutual" applies, as in do I use it for both internet and internal, or only internet. I want to understand which values should be set for the "AuthMechanism" attribute, and why, given that I want to configure TLS. I have internal applications which I think need separate connectors, from what I have read. I need to know if that is true, and how to configure that. I have multifunction printers which send scans via email, which I think also need separate connectors, and I need to know how to configure that. I have a third party who needs to send email using my DNS name and IP, which I think is called "relay". I need to know if that is correct, and how to configure it. Links to articles which don't present specific instructions on how to accomplish what I listed above are not helpful. Explanations of how these connectors are used for my specific needs are very helpful, and I appreciate the help. 

Other than the bad performance is completly possible to Install a Virtual Box virtual machine inside another virtual machine. Due VirtualBox doesnt virtualize Intel VT-X or AMD-V in its virtual machines and the VirtualBox requires those technolgies for run 64 virtual machines, the second Virtual Machine should be of 32 bits. 

We have a latpop that when it is connected to the wireless network, all other laptops of the network start to have intermittent connection. Why could be this happening? The computer is not getting IP Address when is connected to the wireless network. 

AS Jscott says you can configure it and i will operate perfectly without System Center Configuration Manager but you will lose the reports and alerts components. 

For dont have this kind of issues the better choice is not to download the Symbols. Instead you can use a Symbols Server. This is a Microsoft place where they have saved the most recent symbols and if you configure it in your WinDbg will download the exact symbols that it needs on demand.` You define your symbols insted of a local hard drive path, something like: srvf:\symbols\websymbols$URL$ Check at this link how to configue Web Symbols on WinDbg. Regards. 

Is there any recommened array for placing the disks of a virtual infraestrcture. As example, I heard that for the OS disk is recommened a mirror array. For placing virtual hard dkis which is recommended? 

There is a lot, depends of the thing to manage, some software have web consoles, you even can install ssh on a Windows PC to connect to it. But by default windows comes with two tools: Remote Desktop and MMC. 

This is not exactly what you need but if are in Windows 7 a really good alternative is to change the location of the Libraries. By this method you save Documents, Pictures, etc but not all the profile in the D drive. Last night i created a tool that may be useful for you: Set Libraries. 

You have this issue because you are running an unssoported for Hyper-v version of Windows Server 2003 R2. You are running Windows Server 2003 R2 SP1. You should install the Service Pack 2. Then install the Hyper-V integration services and restart the virtual machine. You will have the virtual NIC working. Alternative if you really cannot install the Service Pack 2, you can manually install the driver from the integration services ISO using the device manager (), but this is not recommended. 

By default VPN would use UDP port 1194 for its traffic, you can check this by running and you'll see if VPN is using TCP or UDP for its traffic (depending on your VPN configuration). On a basic server installation these iptables rules would be sufficient to make the VPN work: 

Absolutely not, removing the root password would be a great security risk, if you want to modify the root password I would suggest that you set a strong random password for the root user. Even tho Now you have root user locked down for SSH access only to your SSH key, your next step would be to check which other users have shell access and remove it if not needed, and do the same for any additional user accounts you may create and keep SSH access only to the root user. If you do choose to remove the password for any user, it should have also shell access removed in by setting the shell to . A different approach would be to disable password login for SSH for all users and allow public key authentication only. 

That is the problem with Wordpress where the installation to Domain A would take over before you ever come to the DomainA,B Wordpress installation because of the Wordpress mod_rewrite rules inside the .htaccess file. Can you answer why would you use such setup, to have a Wordpress installation inside a Wordpress installation ? It would be far more logical to have separate installations, for example: public_html/domaina.com/ public_html/domainb.com/ Are you using cPanel for this installation? 

Also another suggestion, if you would be using this server just to serve files, I would suggest a switch to nginx that would prove itself beneficial in resource usage and the performance you would get out of it compared to Apache server which is good to a certain level. But this depends on your systems setup. 

I'm trying to build a customized version of a nginx package for Debian/Ubuntu which had a different set of modules opposed to the default version. What would be the fastest way to modify the debian/ structure (and which files) if I'd want to rename the package from 'nginx' to 'my-nginx' for example? I've got the source deb package unpacked and which files I'd need to modify in nginx-1.4.5/debian/ directory (holding the control, rules.. files) have buildpackage generate my-nginx-1.4.5.deb package instead of nginx-1.4.6.deb package. I appreciate your help! 

You are right. A lot of companies doesn't have a a public DMZ so they cannot have two public IPs in the server witouht NAT. Without this Teredo doesnt work. In Windows Server 2008 for enable Direct Access from the GUI you have to enable Teredo, so if you don't have this requierement it won't work. You have two alternatives: 

For now you can see the activation status of your machines using the graphical Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT) 2.0 and from the tool you can force the inmediate activation towards the KMS Server. 

Not. You are doing it ok. In an Hyper-V team you can bing a real network adapter with the same name to a virtual network in all the nodes. You should do this and this is the recommended by Microsoft. Altough you are using the NICs for doing a lot of things and that could be genereating your problems. Keep in mind that only use two network adapters for this scenario is not the best option and could have unexpected behavior. Based on the Microsoft recommendations you should have in all the Hyper-V nodes the following: 

Update: I created an automated solution for fix this issue. Troubleshooting pack available at $URL$ With the help of Microsoft premier support I found the fix. The issue was caused by a software damaging the Teredo interface. In my case it was Checkpoint Secure Client. To solve it, this is the procedure: 

That you aproved an update does not mean it will be automatically available for the clients PCs. It will need to be downloaded first. So maybe this is your problem. You approve the update and you want to have it and your clients instantally and it does not work this way. You need to wait to the update is completed downloaded in your WSUS server. 

If you cannot do it using System Center Configuration Manager you have to edit the Windows Image, the file, of that sequence task. You can add the File using the command avaibale in the free download Microsoft AIK. The procedure to add the language pack with is here, in this Microsoft Technet article: Add and Remove Language Packs Offline 

Rules in the Windows Firewall can be bundle together and activated or deactivated as a group. With command you can add rules to the Firewall. Use the switch for manage the AdvFirewall groups. Use something like this:
