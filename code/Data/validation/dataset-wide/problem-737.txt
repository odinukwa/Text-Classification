The wheel itself is not asymmetric, but the rim is. The reason for this is that the cassette hub itself is asymmetric, and shifting the spoke attachment at rim allows more even spoke tension. The clear benefit of even tension is durability. On one hand, peak tension and associated stresses are reduced, on the other hand loose spokes cause problems and increased minimum tension reduces those. Efficiency and reactivity are marketing speak, but surely appeal to buyers. Dish is another term for asymmetric spoke angle and tension. The asymmetric rim allows less dish for same hub and rim dimensions. 

You should mount the tire first and inflate second. Tubes are not supposed to be inflated outside tires, they will behave like balloons but the material they are made of is not as stretchy. 

Wider tires are the first thing to try. The BadBoys are basically rigid mountain bikes with 622mm wheels and narrow tires, so you could also put on mountain bike sized wheels and very wide tires. With a second set of wheels, it's easy to change between road and off-road riding. About suspension forks, with current geometry there isn't much room for the suspension to work. You could install a 29" suspension fork, but that would change the bike's geometry. 

Taking into account the strava ladder, with kom in 20 minutes, and experience on similar length and average gradient climbs, my girlfriend, who is an occasional rider, (less than 1.000 km a year) does approximately double time than the kom, and stops around 3 times in the side of the road. New roads in Spain do not usually have veeeery steep sections (10 +) but older roads do. 

Just estimating from the picture it could be late seventies early eighties I see similar bikes for sale at around 150 € With a bit of effort it coud be turned into a robust, efficient commuter, but it is not worth too much as antique. The frame is the best part, but equipping everything else new might get expensive. But the front wheel doesn't look that ruined, you could put new spokes. A thorough cleansing and lubing and new cables and that and the bike could go as it is. I'd put wider tires but that could be a problem with the fenders. Also old brakes like those can be weak, so that could prove a necessary change. 

BB30 is Cannondale's (now open) standard for how the crankset fits into the frame. Cannondale invented the BB30 bottom bracket in 2000 and debuted it at the Tour De France (I couldn't find any information about how they faired) in 2006 the BB30 became an free international standard allowing any cycle manufacturer to use it. 

I think this is the tip of a major crime wave. We will look back on this as the very first instance of The Great Tube thief. With her cunning and guile she will continue to evade detection as she travels the world stealing inner tubes, willy, and quite literally, nilly. Whether they are beautifully crafted, lightweight sleek handcrafted latex tubes, with long, elegant, smooth presta valves. Or fat, dumpy and heavy butyl ones with dented capless, Schrader valve. She won't care, she'll have the lot. We'll never know what she does with them all, it will be the eternal unsolved mystery of cycling. Just be careful the next time you pull up at the lights, watch out for her ninja like skills. Or before you have chance to pull off before that rogue BMW, your tubes will gone forever... P.S. I do apologise! it seems the urge to write something stupid in this place just overcame me ;) 

Because it would be just a waste of the money invested in weight reduction / aerodynamics to use it in plain clothes and with a beastly saddle. Now if you refer to something like this: 

There are organizations that offer riding in traffic classes, they even plan with you your best commute route, I would look into that as a way to gain confidence. Keep in mind that if you are afraid or you doubt at some intersection or maneouvre it can be dangerous if someone decides they don't want to wait for you to make your move. Confidence and paying attention to your environment is best for safety, which includes, as mentioned above, claiming all the lane for you. Practice and get proper confidence on your skills, get a good helmet,(I wouldn't go for the full closed hwlmet because in the tradeoff between visibility and increased face security I think it is better to have more visibility), see that your bike is in excellent riding condition, gears brakes, etc, make yourself seen without blinding other road users, that's it. And then, rememeber you can't be 100% safe on the bike, but just walking on the city is also dangerous, we have to go outside the womb 

Yes, chain falling off the pulley is expected. When you backpedal, the chain is moving from rear cog to pulley and you are moving the pulley away from the incoming chain. Don't do that. The pulley is by the way really worn, replacing it might improve things. It should work, but you need to be very precise with the shifter. 

In short, yes. A single web search for "Ultegra 6870 derailleur spare parts" will find an exploded view diagram with spare part codes. It is fairly clear that the only differing parts are cage plates. The parts go by codes Y5YC98080 and Y5YC25000. 

The derailleur in the picture has been scratched and the cable is connected wrong, but it should work if you install the cable correctly. Searching for "RD-M53P SGS" does not find anything except this question. However, all Shimano rear derailleurs specified for 9 speeds and below have the same actuation ratio, so any of these should work. The derailleur in the photo looks like 9-speed model and it is installed in 7-speed bike. 

Because I have had my feet sliding from the pedals indeed, and foud that the shape of this sole (possibly just one of the slots/carves on the sole, not two) does make my feet grip better to the pedal and does well to avoid sliding. I'm a student so I'm not wealthy, and I rather not buy some pedals and shoes just to check and see no real improvement. But what is more, I use the same bike to commute and to go on longer routes, and I don't see myself going to class or part time job with cycling shoes, or get the platform/cleat pedal combo. But I also wanted a jersey after those rides, to keep the cereal chocolate bars in the handy pockets, and the pants with cushion, and what is more, I wanted a better, lighter, shifters in brake levers, bike. I was / am, seriusly considering spending some of my savings in this, that is, in the full equip for a road cyclist, expecting to be able to ride at the other riders pace in an easier way. But I'm afraid that the main reason that I lagged and struggled was that I am just not as fit as them in regards to longer cycling. I live way uphill and daily climb some 6 km in 5-10 % steep, in town, and I usually go on longer routes (30-50 km) some evenings and weekends, but I reckon they are simply more fit. Now, thinking of buying a new road bike, I would be afraid of leaving it on the city street, so that implies keeping two bikes. For the new bike, I feel weird to get a 1500€ bike and equip it with platform pedals, so I should get clipless, and get shoes, and then, I feel like I have to buy also jersey and pants, and then I started thinking that this is a bit like internet explorer in windows, it goes bundled, you must go with cleats and spandex, because everyone else is doing so, so it must be better, but if it was not that significantly better it is a bit weird, at least to me to just wear this, maybe with a couple pockets on the side: 

It's probably a Phillips brand English roadster. The lugs on this example do not match the picture, but the strange looking rear fork and BSA bottom bracket are typical on English 3 speeds. 

They fit, in the sense that you can install them in the frame (if the axles are correct, hub width is correct, etc). The problems are: 

The thicknesses of 8 and 9 speed Shimano cogs differ by 0.02mm ($URL$ I would say that the same chainwheel is compatible with 8 and 9 speed chains. 

The cracks will expose the internal structure to elements. So yes, they are not going to last as long as non-cracked ones but very probably not going to explode right away either. The Nokia tires that used to be popular in my country developed cracks between tread and sidewall after a few months' use and could still be ridden for years afterwards. Your mileage may vary. 

First, because in your position it takes effort to pedal standing up instead of sitting, and that effort is better spent in moving the bike forward. Maintaining one's weight at back takes more effort than the usual standing pedaling position. Second, because there is no need to reach the ground with both feet while riding. When stopped, it is easy to get out of saddle, tilt the bike enough to reach the ground or just reach the ground with one's toes. Most people have moving joints in their necks and can turn their heads so that they can see. 

Those are called gumwalls. With this keyword you can easily search for them. Brands I see mounted on my friend's bikes are the likes of bontrager, panaracer, schwalbe, but Id say that most tyre manufacturers have a gumwall offer. 

This is the kind of bike I would look for, that I think can give you more for your money: something from early 90's with an old shimano 105 group or similar, which provides reliable shifting and braking, steel frame that will still last a lot and not very heavy... these bikes are awesome... not too old to be overpriced as vintage, not so new that will still cost a lot, and really close to modern bike performance once you master downtube shifting. I bought a similar one for 140€ that I was very lucky to get, but I see them in the 200 - 300 € range, which is still a really great bike for the price. Now, for mountain bikes, it is another story, those have improved more with time, (suspension, disc brakes, smooth shifting under tension, whatnot ..)and I would go for a new one if I was interested in getting out to the trails. The bikes I mentioned are also easy to resell at the price you bought, so if you get into more serious riding you can always sell and get new one without losing much (which will not happen if you upgrade a lot) 

No, it is not possible. You need to replace the entire hub, and the easiest way to do that is to replace the entire wheel. 

The part is called simply brake adjuster or brake adjusting barrel or "bremszugeinsteller" in the promised land of affordable mail order. It is indeed held in place only by pressure from cable and is easily lost when the cable is removed. In the picture the nut is put on wrong side to hold the adjuster in place without cable, I have never seen a second nut like on the right before. 

The source of the whooshing sound is contact between tires and road. The sound is present with all road bikes, but much quieter with aluminum rims and tires with thick sidewalls. What makes carbon wheels loud is that they resonate like acoustic instrument's sound box at the tire noise frequency range and the larger surface is more efficient at transmitting the sound. You can hear the resonant frequencies if you just tap the wheel with your finger nail, a carbon wheel will have a lower pitched and much louder sound. 

Almost all stems (aside from a few very expensive carbon ones!) are designed to be mounted either way around. The pressures are in the same direction regardless of which way up it is. (they're just reversed) They are designed to be used either way up, otherwise manufacturers would need to produce double the number of stems to create positive and negatively angled setups. Out of curiosity I've just looked through a range of carbon stems online, and the vast majority of them are of an identical construction to their less exotic counterparts (complete with writing on both sides) There were a couple of stems that integral mounts for computers that didn't seem to be reversible. But by and large, they all appear to be designed to be used either way around. 

The claimed advantage of BB30 is an increase in stiffness and a 4% increase in drivetrain efficiency, achieved through an increase in size allowing larger diameter frame tubes. (according to Cannondale - I don't have the rep to comment!) The Caad10 uses 110 BCD 5 arm chainring, if you put that into your favourite search engine there are a large selection of chainrings that will be compatible. You don't specifically need to replace them with the same size chainring, you can change them depending on your requirements. The Shimano 105 chainrings should be a direct replacement, and are relatively inexpensive. Personally I wouldn't try to straighten an old chainring, as the metal would have stretched and you are unlikely to get it back to being entirely flat. 

Having such a limited amount of time for a group ride that in order to finish it on time you would need to push group speed up to a point where the ride is not enjoyable or even feasible 

It is not allowed by UCI rules, but comissars usually allow it if it is due to mechanical reasons and used to get back to the peloton, since they have discretional ability to decide. Time penalties or disqualification if used to gain advantage over the peloton. So, rule enforcement may vary depending on many circumstances, and I guess they don't want to lose stars like Froome, that could also be important when turning a blind eye on some minor issue 

Starting from a dead stop, am afraid it is a matter of leg and core strength and handling skills, which seems that you do not quite have yet. They will come with enough riding time. In the meantime you can try to get the bike in motion by pushing the road with your leg as when you push a skateboard or a kid's scooter, then turning the cranks will be easier. I do this a lot to start when I am in hard gears, not only uphill. If the slope is too steep it may not work, but if slope is too steep you might not be able to resume climbing unless you go down and then turn 180 degrees ti face the hill again.
