I feel like you’re inching towards the paradox of learning, a very important problem for especially ancient Philosophy. —You could think of it from a teacher’s perspective: 

Consider the fact that humankind has, for the most part, entered secular modernity -- and that humanistic benevolent democracies are the norm in most wealthy countries; this would seem prima facie evidence there are indeed effective "non-divine" standards of good and evil. The problem is of course determining what exactly "good and evil" mean in the context of secular ethics. Note that this isn't exactly a trivial subject even when you've got a theological framework to help sort out conceptual problems. At any rate, many secular ethical frameworks have evolved since the waning of religious institutions' influence over the state. Wikipedia's entry on the subject may not be the worst place to start. From there: 

This made me think of Spinoza, who might suggest that emotional states are “fluctuations”, a mobile dynamism capturing the relations of movement and rest between the parts of the body. In other words you can always do something to become a little more cheerful, to augment your Potential by improving the “harmony” of your internal composition (relations of movement and rest within and between the “elements” of your organism.) On the other hand, melancholy and other sad passions are a kind of breakdown or dis-accord in these internal movements or modes of infra-relations. Sort of like how there is a minimal temperature, where a body is at total rest, melancholy has a limit; whereas cheerfulness, as a measure of harmony or accord within your dynamic composition, can always be increased through integrating your “speeds” ever more harmoniously. There’s always one more thing you can do which will improve the way you compose with the world, which will enhance the tone of your fluctuations. 

I think a simple gist might be that you are not responsible for the concatenation of circumstances which led to the trolley dilemma. Even though people may come to harm owing to your inaction, this is also "equally" owing to the inaction of any other observer... Whereas you will be directly responsible for any harm you cause through your actions. Passively permitting people to die through inaction is certainly callous, and may in fact amount to criminal negligence. But actively causing death is plainly murderous, regardless of good intentions or consequences. 

I'm not sure that being in a simulated universe really poses a significant question for scientists. On my reading this is still essentially a metaphysical question. The realism-idealism debate hasn't stopped any scientists from getting to work that I know of -- meta is ultimately a distraction, at least in the last instance, and engineers and scientists have things to build and problems to solve (not years to worry about whether we're in a simulated universe or not and how you'd even know the difference.) In fact, you'll probably find that most philosophers generally don't spend a lot of time in their formal expositions worrying over these sorts of things either -- they too have more interesting fish to fry. That said, I am currently working through De Landa's Philosophy and Simulation, which I highly recommended for a thoughtful (and non-Bostrom-oriented approach) to some of the larger questions of emergence and simulation and their implications for philosophy and science. Now, if we are granting that we are in someone's ancestor simulation, it is certainly possible that we may run into certain limits "hardcoded" by various parameters of the simulation -- an example might be that there could be clauses in the simulation programming designed to identify civilizations that begin to develop the ability to simulate, and take some in-simulation action based on those events (which could include just about anything up to and including triggering the termination of the simulation, etc.) The simulation hypothesis is in a way very similar to the claim the universe has a creator, and unless these sorts of "external context" claims end up incorporated into a societal effort to repress innovation, these sorts of ideas certainly don't stop scientists and engineers from solving problems and building useful new things. UPDATE: I have realized your question is somewhat more nuanced than my initial reading suggested. I might suggest that Ockham's razor cuts both ways on these sorts of questions. Remember that Bostrom's own presentation of the question is a trilemma: either 

What is a "straw man" argument? Assuming an interlocutor is utilizing such an argument against you, what are some techniques for countering it? What motivations might lie behind a disputant using a straw man argument rather than engage in a more straightforward debate? 

A rational explanation appeals to our critical faculties -- it does not attempt to appeal to our passions or weaknesses. Rationality involves the justification of beliefs; a rational explanation precisely gives reasons for a conviction, and these reasons are validly correlated with the inferences the argument wishes us to draw. An irrational or unreasonable argument is marked by various misalignments between the premises and the conclusions; some of these are so commonly exploited that they are classified as traditional logical fallacies. While I am definitely a believer in clear formulations of concepts, it is undoubtedly the case that "reason" is often a likely mask for other interests. What is said to be "rational" may turn out upon critical analysis merely to be a precept of common sense without justification, or indeed someting more sinister -- a rationalization for social or psychic repression. And underneath this sort of "rationality" there is only drift; and as at the very least it is difficult to conceptually define what "pure reason" might mean (though cf. Kant) there is a certain sense in which the ultimate meaning of our "reason" may merely be a series of long errors. 

I'm not sure if there's a named fallacy involved here. But it seems to me that the ring of Gyges might have some relevance or at least be interesting in this context. The ring grants the wearer invisibility. This is the original "What would you do if you did not have to answer to society?" thought experiment. In the Republic, Glaucon uses the myth to show that no one with the ring would be immune to corruption, claiming that not even gods could resist it. It might also be interesting to read Deleuze's short essay on desert (and deserted) islands. He gives a reading of Robinson Crusoe there, and is trying to show how the psychological movement towards the desert island is related to the geological movements that condition the island in the first place -- the continuous struggle between the land and the sea, the twin necessities of separation and creation (to really create, you had better be separate...) 

Affects are transindividual, if that helps — they may pass through subjects, but they’re situated fundamentally in a pre-individual “milieu” or context/environment. Consider the specificity involved in a certain degree of heat — heat transfers between bodies, at rates related to the bodies interface to each other. The radiation of intensive degrees passes through the entire field; it doesn’t belong to subjects, though they may participate in the dissipation or intensification. But even speeds are also this way: pure celerities which activate bodies. Thought is an extensive fluid medium of which each individual has a tiny “flux” which seems to belong to them, but which pre-exists and extends beyond them. Simondon is the key reference here on the problem of the pre-individual and trans-individual (as opposed to the “merely” inter-individual...) Another quick thought here might be about the molecularity of affects: the way they participate only in an indirect and statistical way in the construction of molar properties (like the emotive flux of sentient bodies.) Their primordial reality, where they have full existence, is the pre-individual field of intensities, from which individuals emerge and fall back. (A glorious body without organs...) There are links here to Spinozism and substance-monism that might be interesting to pursue: the perfect innocence of becoming and affects as movements rather than subjects, operating pre-individual intensities on a differential plane. Affects transdifferentiate bodies; are “learning” or “healing” emotions, exactly? Do they really belong to you the way your joy or sadness do? Deleuze is the key reference in my mind, though again it is effectively a Spinozist-Nietzschean concept “maximized” by Simondonian analyses of the pre-individual, inter-individual, trans-individual, etc. —Klossowski might be another jumping off point, who shows how some feelings participate in movements which tend to dissolve or “forget” the individual identity. 

If you tie existence to perception or measurement, you’ve also de-materialized it — this position is sometimes called “immaterialism”, wherein only percepts and perceivers really “exist”. But what becomes of objects when no one is perceiving them? This aspect is usually resolved by having a universal field of perception (an omniscient observer.) On the other hand, given there are degrees or levels or perception — not to mention the “singularity” of different perspectives — one problem is: how do we handle degrees of “existence” (e.g., objects on the “threshold” of perceptibility)? 

A few psychoanalytic remarks on paranoia seem perhaps appropriate here. The paranoiac process has some important relationships to jealousy and even to perversion. Zizek always talks about this, the way the jealous person is always paranoid; even and especially if they are correct in their suspicions. Despite the ostensible logic of 'uncovering secrets', the underlying dynamisms of jealousy exhibit a clearly perverse relationship to knowledge, the truth, the authenticity of the other's discourse and so on, that mean that regardless of the "objective" state of reality, their image suffers inevitably, structurally, even 'ontologically' as it were, from massive (symptomatic) distortions, exaggerations, etc. Black humor, or the obscure logic of the dream or the joke -- except now applied variously to large-scale social, political and economic arrangements. At any rate, this would be the key thing for me: not to elide the sociopolitical dimension of the psychoanalytic problem. There is in short a palpably reactionary dimension of conspiratorial logic. In other words the paranoiac structurally avoids the encounter with "real" (libidinal) political economy -- the actual collective investments of desire that in the last instance actually program political and economic behavior, but which may be reprogrammed; and so on. Another way of approaching this problem is perhaps to emphasize the absurd gaps, plots holes and so forth, characteristic of the ontological structure of paranoiac epistemology. To dramatize this we could consider the conspiracy projected onto infinity -- in other words, scaled up to universal heights: a cosmic or biological conspiracy, conspiracies against the whole human race and so on. It is perhaps more or less clear that at this point we have flipped from the paranoiac to the schizophrenic pole: much closer to living and consuming the raw intensive substrate of existence, although the distinctness-immediacy of this new vision perhaps comes at the cost of obscurity or confusion. A new kind of darkness and depth, in which there is no real secret or truth but only a sort of blindness. 

Pierce reformulated this several years later (Peirce, 1905, from "Issues of Pragmaticism" in The Monist v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481-499, see p. 481 via Google Books and via Internet Archive): 

I might suggest looking at Postulates of Linguistics, the fourth plateau I think, which deals with this in a little more depth. I wanted to draw together a few lines and thoughts here to maybe help bootstrap some further analysis. Quickly: D+G's strategy involves deployment of mutually-exclusive dualisms or binarisms; in order to shatter or crystallize the hierarchical model-copy general system (of knowledge, power, etc.) Rhizome asks a question about the speeds and movements that compose a book: what is the body without organs of a book? For a long time, they explain, we had an image of the book as nature, arborescent, vegetal. --But might there be other kinds of books...? :) It strikes me as perhaps also interesting here that they characterize language as spreading like a patch of oil: a smooth space, expansive or even "superfluid"; like society, like desire, flowing and escaping... 

Francois Laruelle's General Theory of Victims answers pretty directly to the terms of your research. From the notes on the text: 

A dispute generally centers around a “differend” — a point of contention owing to incompatible viewpoints or perspectives. Consider a legal trial where a defendant is accused of wrong-doing. What grounds the difference in perspective, the parallax between the social position of Victim and Perpetrator? The idea of the “wrong” provides an opportunity for two different cases or points to be articulated, which both map onto the “conditional” question of whether there was a wrong at all. (If the victim wasn’t wronged, they have no standing to sue; and indeed the alleged perpetrator would be “wronged” by the false charge!) The two perspectives on the wrong — a different wrong from each point of view — are like two incompossible worlds; their universes can’t coincide. The trial forms a truth procedure deciding on the universe of “reference”, identifying which “side” of the differend is upheld (which wrongs, if any, are to be “righted” by the court.) 

Keith Ansell Pearson also has an excellent entry on Nietzsche in the "How to Read" series that is well worth a look. 

Maybe it's inherently interesting and important to create universes, if you have the power to do it? That it would be intellectually interesting is probably understating the case a bit; but having the power, would it not also come to seem important, to create regions where infinite power/transmissibility were to be held back, if only to understand this 'part' of your power too? For an infinite power, creating universes is the same thing as what it is (and does.) My thinking on this would be influenced more by Spinoza, but my sense is that the logic of omnitude sort of inherently suggests that everything will be done, since it is capable of being done, and so this (world/universe) too "must" exist. 

For some context, I want to note that Aristotle's assertions in the poetics about catharsis "releasing" the dangerous pities and fears aroused by tragedy are in the larger context of the value of drama and verse, the problem of empathy with 'dangerous' impulses that may be dramatized by playwrights or versified by poets. Nietzsche is noting that in making such a claim about catharsis, Aristotle is conceding his basic point that pity is as viral and dangerous an emotion as fear -- perhaps especially for crowds. Nietzsche goes on to say, as it were asserting Aristotle against Schopenhauer, that the instinct of life would precisely prompt us to "puncture" dense concentrations of pity and discharge them, releasing the tension and danger that have accumulated. But the problem, of course, is identifying and isolating such pathological distortions in the first place -- seeing beyond the surface to what Nietzsche calls 'our sort' of humanity. He says this seeing-beyond (or perhaps we can say "looking-down") is the sign by which philosophers recognize one another in the last instance.
