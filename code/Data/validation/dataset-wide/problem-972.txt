The text of the introduction to the BBC Podcast Sea Levels Rise; The Compass, Living on the Edge Episode 1 of 4 says: 

My primary question: is this a remarkable event, or something that over time happens regularly? Isn't this just a natural part of "those slow-flowing glaciers... journey toward the sea." ? I'm also wondering 1) Is an iceberg the size of Delaware actually remarkable, or something that just happens from time-to-time? And 2) how they (actually) know the crack goes all the way to the ocean - can they actually see the water in images, or is this a hypothesis based on understanding of cracks of this length and width? I can ask as a separate questions if it's too much to ask here. 

I snapped this photo with my cell phone at a fishing harbor in northern Taiwan. I recognize a weather vane + anemometer, and I suspect the two large, dark things at the tops of poles might be omnidirectional antennas, but the item near the right shaped like an upside-down funnel at the end of a u-shaped tube appeared to be transparent, as if glass or plastic. I've never seen anything like it. Any thoughts? 

Question: Is this collective horizontal alignment a known effect at even 1 degree, much less 0.1 degrees? Has this ever been measured to be true over such large areas, or even calculated? Although the result is preliminary and the discussion short, the authors suggest that this uniform horizontal alignment would not be an unusual occurrence at all. For example, later in the discussion: 

News of Hawaii has got me thinking... I've lived in Taiwan for many years and hiked many kinds geologically interesting mountain and seashore rock formations, seen steaming, sulfury fumaroles, even ate my lunch in a (presumably long extinct) volcano crater. From what I've learned from others, volcanism has a significant contribution to Taiwan's geology and geography. But is this very old and no longer a factor? Question: Is there any historical reference to volcanic activity in Taiwan? Is there much chance of it again in the near future? 

I'd like to look into the possibility of using a Raspberry Pi and the PiCam module to detect rain, and to try to make some measurements of droplet size and rate. This could be done using an LED flash or a (modified/pulsed) laser pointer equipped with a fan-out element, synchronizing the flash/pulse with the Pi camera's electronic shutter for a "freeze frame" effect, followed by some Python image analysis (e.g. ). This is for fun, and not meant to be a quantitative rain gauge necessarily. In order to better estimate the challenge, I'd like to get some feel for the distribution of sizes, speeds, and either areal rates (drops per sec per square meter) or number densities (drops per cubic meter). I can convert between various units and histograms, but I don't know where to find a good survey to understand over what ranges these can vary. See also Will long-term viewing of a sunny sky hurt the Pi Camera? for pics of a cool Pi sky camera by @ThomasJacquin as described here. Edit: per this comment I should point out my Raspberry Pi will be within a few meters of the Earth's surface, where I can keep an eye on it.

These are a series of areal flights over antarctic regionss to collect images and data. The image above of the crack in the Larsen-C ice shelf was a featured photo and more can be read about it here. In the image gallery the caption states: 

The Nature Communications paper Prompt gravity signal induced by the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake presents a "...report on the search for a prompt gravity signal during the rupture of the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake in data recorded by a superconducting gravimeter in the underground Kamioka Observatory and five nearby broadband seismometers from the Japanese network F-net." They conclude that with a certainty of about 99% that a prompt gravity signal was detected. The change in position of large masses of crust resulted in a tiny change in gravity even 500 km away and this was within detectable limits of this extremely sensitive instrument. Since gravity's influence "travels" at the speed of light it is suggested this might be an avenue to be explored for a potential early warning system. Considering that electrical and optical signals (e.g. the internet or radio or a more dedicated communications system) travel about 2/3 the speed of light in wires and fiber, and even conventional internet pings are of the order of 100 milliseconds or better, is there any suggestion or discussion anywhere else besides this paper that super-sensitive gravimeters would be in any way better and/or cheaper than a network of cheap sensors? In either case the idea is an early warning for something "big" rather than accurate measurements. Although the paper and analysis is interesting and elegant - is there any serious discussion or speculation that something like this - a prompt gravity signal - could somehow be actually useful as an early warning system?

I understand that coal is a complex material, it's more than a lump of carbon. But what are the types of chemical reactions within coal that will cause a pile of it to self-ignite? Is moisture always required? Is there moisture in freshly mined coal naturally, or is it absorbed hygroscopically from the atmosphere or is a liquid source necessary (getting wet)? 

Also see Editor Highlight I can not access the article yet, but the BBC interview with Costard leaves me puzzled about the speed of tsunamis: 

The magnitude and location of the event are strongly suggestive of the cause, but if the location were very different, it sounds like the nature of the seismic waves would already indicate that the source was artificial rather than a natural geological seismic event. Question: What is it about a seismic wave measurements that would allow one to distinguish between natural geological and artificial causes? 

There seems to be multiple, distinct specimens, and yet I don't see "Imilac meteorites" (plural) written here or anywhere. For example, in this British Natural History Museum article The Imilac meteorite: a gem as old as the solar system: 

So are all of these Imilac specimens believed to be fragments of one single object that exploded before reaching the surface? If so, why not call them Imilac meteorites (plural) instead of talking about "Imilac meteorite" as a name for a material that is uncountable?

For a uniform mixture of ideal gases, I think that the concentration of a gas reported in parts per million by volume (ppmV) and micro-moles per mole (μmol/mol) would be the same. When I see atmospheric CO2 discussed, I have seen both units used, depending on the source. See for example, the comments under this answer. Since multi-atomic gases like N2, O2, H2O and CO2 are not ideal gases (even monatomic gases are not absolutely ideal) I would guess that for realistic atmospheric samples at different altitudes and times, the CO2 concentrations expressed in ppmV and μmol/mol would not be numerically identical. Further, due to the variations in concentrations of the other constituents they wouldn't even be strictly proportional. Is there a handy, approximate conversion constant, or function, that is more accurate than unity? Is there a nearly-exact one? 

I've just learned in this answer that tiltmeters (which I assume measure changes in tilt) are used near active volcanos. (Saw a mention in item 4. here also.) What kind of geological (volcanological?) information can be learned from tilt data? Can it also offer predictive benefits, trigger evacuation warnings? 

I finally broke down and read the Wikipedia article on spontaneous combustion and I was surprised to see how serious of a problem this can be. Wet hay, oily rags, there really are exothermic reactions in these combinations that speed up as the temperature increases. Then I saw the following: 

One way to estimate the turbidity of water while in the field is to use a turbidity tube. So far I've found two sources where I can get an idea of the locations of NTU markings along the tube. The PDF file The Turbidity Tube: Simple and Accurate Measurement of Turbidity in the Field - originally by Elizabeth Myre & Ryan Shaw at Michigan Tech is a nice introduction to the concept, outlines how to build a turbidity tube from simple materials and use it, and offers a table of numbers that comes with the following description:
