For $f\in L^{1}(\mathbb R), $ we define $f^{\vee}(x):=\hat{f}(-x)=\int_{\mathbb R} f(\xi) e^{2\pi i \xi\cdot x} d\xi, (x\in \mathbb R).$ Let $f, g\in L^{2}(\mathbb R).$ Then $\hat{f}\hat{g}\in L^{1},$ by Plancherel's theorem and H\"olders inequality, so $(\hat{f}\hat{g})^{\vee}$ make sense. Given $x\in \mathbb R,$ let $h(y)=\overline{g(x-y)}.$ It is easy to see that, $\hat{h}(\xi)=\overline{\hat{g}(\xi)}e^{-2\pi i\xi \cdot x},$ so since $\mathcal{F}$ is unitary on $L^{2},$ $$f\ast g (x)= \int f\bar{h}= \int \hat{f}\bar{\hat{h}}=\int \hat{f}(\xi)\hat{g}(\xi)e^{2\pi i \xi \cdot x} d\xi =(\hat{f}\hat{g})^{\vee}(x).$$ Thanks, 

My attempt: Suppose $\{f_{n}\}_{n\in \mathbb N}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\mathcal{F}L^{1},$ that is, there is $N\in \mathbb N$, such that, $\|\hat{f_{n}}-\hat{f_{m}}\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}\to 0$, for every $n, m \geq N$; and since $(L^{1}(\mathbb R), \|\cdot\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)})$ is complete, there is a $g\in L^{1}(\mathbb R)$, such that, $\|\hat{f_{n}}-g\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}\to 0$ as $n\to \infty.$ We must find, $h\in \mathcal{F}L^{1}$ such that $\|f_{n}-h\|_{\mathcal{F}L^{1}}\to 0$ as $n\to \infty.$ Now my guess work is that, we should take, $h:=\check{g}$; but then the problem is: can we expect, $\hat{h}=g$ (I know this one can expect, if both $f$ and $\hat{f}$ both are in $L^{1}(\mathbb R)$, by inversion formula); or am I missing some thing ? Thanks, 

I have been learning Wiener amalgam spaces. In Wiener amalgam spaces $W(X, L^2)$, I am taking $X=\mathcal{F}L^{1}=\{f\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb R):\hat{f}\in L^{1}\},$ and $m(x)=1.$ Take $f(x)= \chi_{\mathbb Q}(x), x\in \mathbb R.$ clearly, $f\in L^{2}(\mathbb R).$ 

Vague Attempt : To show $F\in B(\mathbb R)$, that is , by definition of $B(\mathbb R)$, I must show, there exists complex Borel $\mu$ on $\mathbb R$ such that, $$F(y)=\hat{\mu} (y)= \int_{\mathbb R} e^{-iyx} d\mu(x);$$ keeping this goal in mind, inversion formula suggests me that, I should take, $\mu $, such that, $ \int_{\mathbb R} e^{-iyx} d\mu(x) = \int_{\mathbb R} e^{-ixy} \hat{F}(y) dy $ ( the inversion formula valid provided $F, \hat{F} \in L^{1} (\mathbb R)$, and but here in our case this may not be the case and this may be the real difficulties); If this is the case, then I guess, we can define, $\mu (E)=\mu_{F} (E)= \int_{E} \hat{F} (y) dy $, for Borel set $E$ and also I guess, $||\mu||= ||\hat{F}||_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}$; but I really don't see be any connection between $||F||$ and $\sum_{n\in \mathbb Z}|\hat{f}(n)|$; Thanks, 

I have basic training in Fourier and Harmonic analysis. And wanting to enter and work in area of number theory(and which is of some interest for current researcher) which is close to analysis. 

I wants to understand the integrals of the form $$\lambda (x) = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\sin^{2} \alpha x}{\alpha^{2}} d\mu(\alpha), (\mu(0)=0)$$ where $\mu(\alpha)$ is a non decreasing function such that the integral converges for all real $x.$ Trivial Example: If we take, $\mu(\alpha)= \alpha,$ then $\lambda (x)= |x|\frac{\pi}{2}.$ My Questions are: 

(May be this is very basic question for MO) (For details or this question you may see the paper page no. 9, MR2506839, Local well-posedness of nonlinear dispersive equations on modulation spaces; Bull. Lond. Math. Soc. 41 (2009), no. 3, 549-558) Let $u_{0}$ be in the modulation space $M^{p,1}(\mathbb R^{d})= M^{p,1}, \ (1\leq p < \infty).$ Theorem 1. If $u_{0}\in M^{p,1}$ then $||e^{it\bigtriangleup}u_{0}||_{M^{p,1}}\leq C (t^{2}+4\pi^{2})^{\frac{d}{4}} ||u_{0}||_{M^{p,1}},$ where $C$ is universal constant depending only on $d$. Therefore, $||e^{it\bigtriangleup}||_{M^{p,1}(\mathbb R^{d})}\leq C_{T} ||u_{0}||_{M^{p,1}(\mathbb R^{d})},$ where $C_{T}= \sup_{t\in [0, T)} C(t^{2}+ 4\pi^{2})^{d/4}.$ Consider the mapping, $$\mathcal{T}(u)=e^{it\bigtriangleup}(u_{0})-i \int_{0}^{t}e^{i(t-s)\bigtriangleup}( |u|^{2}u) (s) ds.$$ Let $B_{M}$ denote the closed ball of radius $M=2C_{T}\left\|u_{0}\right\|_{M^{p,1}}$ , centred at the origin in the space $C([0, T]; M^{p,1}).$ Theorem 2. If $u\in M^{p,1}$, then $\left\||u|^{2k}u \right\|_{M^{p,1}}\lesssim\left\|u\right \|_{M^{p,1}}^{2k+1}.$ By using, theorem 1 and theorem 2, we notice, \begin{eqnarray*} \left \|\int_{0}^{t}e^{i(t-s)\bigtriangleup}(\lambda |u|^{2k}u)(s)ds \right \|_{M^{p,1}} &\leq & \int_{0}^{t}||e^{i(t-s)\bigtriangleup}(\lambda |u|^{2k}u)(s) ||_{M^{p,1}} ds\\ &\leq & T C_{T} \sup_{t\in [0, T]} \left \|\lambda |u|^{2k}u \right\|_{M^{p,1} (\mathbb R^{d})}\\ & \lesssim & C_{T} T \left \| u(t)\right \|_{M^{p,1}}^{2k+1}. \end{eqnarray*} So,$\left\|\mathcal{T}(u) \right \|_{C([0, T]; M^{p,1})}\leq C_{T}(||u_{0}||_{M^{p,1}}+cT ||u||^{2k+1}_{M^{p,1}}),$ for some universal positive constant $c$. Let $u\in B_{M}$, we obtain,$\left\|T(u)\right \|_{C([0, T]; M^{p,1})} \leq \frac{M}{2}+cC_{T}T M^{2k+1}.$ Now, let $T$ be such that $cC_{T}M^{2k} \leq \frac{1}{2},$ that is, $T\leq \tilde{T}(||u_{0}||_{M^{p,1}}).$ We obtain, $\mathcal{T}(u) \in B_{M},$ and so $\mathcal{T}:B_{M}\to B_{M}.$ : How to prove $$\left\|\mathcal {T}(u)-\mathcal {T} (v) \right \|_{C([0, T]; M^{p,1})}\leq \frac{1}{2}\left\|u-v\right \|_{C([0, T]; M^{p,1})} ? $$ 

Let $f\in L^{1}(\mathbb R)$ and it Fourier transform, $\hat{f} (y) : = \int _ {\mathbb R} f(x) e^{-2\pi i x\cdot y} dx ; y \in \mathbb R ;$ and consider Fourier algebra $$A(\mathbb R):= \{f\in L^{1}(\mathbb R): \hat{f}\in L^{1}(\mathbb R) \}$$ $A(\mathbb R)$ is normed by: $$\left\|f\right\|:= \left\|\hat{f}\right\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}=\int_{\mathbb R}|\hat{f}(\xi)| d\xi; \ (f\in A(\mathbb R)).$$ We note that $A(\mathbb R)$ is a Banach algebra under point wise addition and multiplication. Let $M>0$ and fix it; and consider $B_{M}= \{f\in A(\mathbb R): f|f|\in A(\mathbb R) \ \text{and} \ ||f||\leq M \}.$ 

(This may be very simple question for MO; I had post it to math stack exchange few days back but I could not get any answer(or comment) to it) It is well-known that, for $f,g \in L^{1}(\mathbb R).$ Then, by Fubini's theorem, one can derive, $\widehat{f\ast g} = \hat{f} \cdot \hat{g},$ (that is, Fourier transform takes, convolution to point wise multiplication). Also, we note that the fact, that, for $f, g\in L^{2}(\mathbb R)$ one has, $\widehat{f\ast g} =\hat{f} \cdot \hat{g}.$ Suppose $f, \hat{f} \in L^{p}(\mathbb R)\cap C(\mathbb R) (1<p<\infty, p\neq 2),$ and $g\in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb R),$ (Schwartz space) 

I am a beginner in research and have draft ready for my first article. I have a little confusion about the pure and applied journal in Mathematics. My work belongs to pure mathematics(I think). And wanting to send to the following journal: Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis. But my confusion is whether the above journal is pure or applied ? Or both ? Whether it has good prestige in pure mathematics ? Any of your suggestions would be appreciated, Thanks, 

We consider the nonlinar Schr\"odinger equation(NLS): $$i\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+\Delta_{x}u +\lambda |u|^{2k}u =0, \ u(x, 0)= u_{0}(x);$$ where $\lambda \in \mathbb R, \ k \in \mathbb N,$ and $u(x, t)$ is a complex valued function on $\mathbb R^{n} \times \mathbb R.$ By Duhamel's principle the integral version of NLS has the form $$u(\cdot, t)=e^{it \bigtriangleup}u_{0}(\cdot) -i\int_{0}^{t}e^{i(t-s)\Delta}(\lambda |u|^{2k}u)(s) ds.$$ Let $X$ be a Banach space (consists of functions/distributions on $\mathbb R^n$), and for $T>0,$ we put $C([0, T], X)= \{f:[0, T]\to X: f \ \text{is continuous} \}.$ Assume that the above NLS has a unique local solution $u \in C([0, T], X),$ for small $T>0.$ I am willing to understand the general philosophy for the global existence. 

Let $f, g \in L^{1}(\mathbb T)= L^{1} ([-\pi, \pi))$. We define, the Fourier transform of $f$ as follows: $$\hat{f}(n)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t) e^{-int} dt, \ (n\in \mathbb Z).$$ It is well known that Fourier transform takes convolution to point wise product:indeed,by Fubini-Tonelli theorem and change of variable, we can derive, $$\widehat{(f\ast g)} (n) = \hat{f}(n) \cdot \hat{g} (n) , (n\in \mathbb Z).$$ Suppose $fg \in L^{1} (\mathbb T)$ also. My questions: 

My attempt: Fix $n\in \mathbb Z$. By definition we have, $\widehat{(fg)}((n)= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} ( f(t)\cdot g(t) ) e^{-int} dt $ and $\hat{f}(n) \ast \hat{g} (n)= \sum_{k\in \mathbb Z} \hat{f} (n-k) \hat{g} (k) = \sum_{k\in \mathbb Z} \{\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(t) e^{-i(n-k)t} dt \} \{\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} f(y) e^{-ikt} dy\} $ Thanks, 

Let $\mathbb T$ be a circle group. In 1939, Salem, has shown that, every member of $L^{1}(\mathbb T)$ can written as a product(convolution) some other two members of $L^{1}(\mathbb T),$ that is, $L^{1}(\mathbb T)\subset L^{1}(\mathbb T)\ast L^{1}(\mathbb T);$ other way one can get by Fubini's theorem, so we have, $L^{1}(\mathbb T)=L^{1}(\mathbb T)\ast L^{1}(\mathbb T).$ I have learn from the book(R. E. Edwards, Fourier Series A Modern Introduction Volume 1, p.124), $L^{p}(\mathbb T)=L^{1}(\mathbb T)\ast L^{p}(\mathbb T), (1\leq p < \infty).$ In 1959, Walter Rudin has shown for the real line that, $L^{1}(\mathbb R)=L^{1}(\mathbb R)\ast L^{1}(\mathbb R).$ By Young's inequality, we have, $L^{1}(\mathbb R)\ast L^{p}(\mathbb R) \subset L^{p}(\mathbb R), (1\leq p < \infty).$ My Question is: Is it well-known in a literature that, $L^{p}(\mathbb R)\subset L^{1}(\mathbb R) \ast L^{p}(\mathbb R), (1< p< \infty)$ ? If answer is yes, please let me know some references; If not, what one can expect ? Thanks, 

I am trying to understand Besov spaces; and I am eager to see why the various norms are equivalent on it. Let $\phi$ be a $C^{\infty}$ function on $\mathbb R^{n}$ with $ \operatorname{supp} \phi \subset \{\xi \in \mathbb R^{n}: |\xi|\leq 2, \phi(\xi)=1$ if $|\xi|\leq 1.$ Let $j\in \mathbb N$ and $$\phi_{j}(\xi)= \phi(2^{-j}\xi)- \phi(2^{-j+1}\xi), (\xi \in \mathbb R^{n})$$ Then we have $$\operatorname{supp} \phi_{j} \subset \{\xi\in \mathbb R^{n}: 2^{j-1}\leq |\xi| \leq 2^{j+1} \}, j\in \mathbb N $$ and, with $\phi_{0}=\phi,$ $$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \phi_{k}(\xi)=1, \text{if} \ \xi\in \mathbb R^{n}.$$ In other words, $\{\phi_{k}\}_{k\in\mathbb N_{0}}$ is a resolution of unity. Let $f\in \mathcal{S'}$ then $\phi_{k}(D)f(x)= (\phi_{k}\hat{f})^{\vee}(x), k\in \mathbb N_{0}, x \in \mathbb R^{n}$ is an entire analytic function, (by Paley-Wiener-Schwartz theorem) and we have $$f= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \phi_{k}(D)f;$$ convergence in $\mathcal{S'}.$ In other words, we decompose $f$ in entire analytic functions, and we introduce spaces by checking the behaviour of these analytic functions with respect to $x\in \mathbb R^{n}$ and $k\in \mathbb N_{0}.$ Let $0<p\leq \infty, 0 < q\leq \infty$ and $s\in \mathbb R$ then $$B^{s}_{p,q}(\mathbb R^{n})=\{f\in \mathcal{S'}(\mathbb R^{n}):\|f\|_{B^{s}_{p,q}}:=\left(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} 2^{ksq} \|(\phi_{k}\hat{f})^{\vee}\|_{L^{p}}^{q}\right)^{1/q}<\infty \}.$$ To begin with we deal with integral means of differences. Let $\triangle_{h}f(x):= f(x+h)-f(x), \forall h, x \in \mathbb R, \omega_{p}(f,h) := \left(\int_{\mathbb R} |\triangle_{h}f(x)|^{p} dx \right)^{1/p}$ Assume that $m<s<m+1$ for some $m\in \mathbb N.$ My Question is: 

Young's inequlity tells us that $L^{1}(\mathbb R)\ast L^{p}(\mathbb R) \subset L^{p}(\mathbb R)$ with norm inequality $$\|f\ast g\|_{L^{p}} \leq \|f\|_{L^1}\|g\|_{L^p};$$ and of course this inequality has lot of importance in Analysis and PDEs. (every body know this, and perhaps all the time we are using these kind of inequality) On the other hand, Cohen- Hewitt factorization theorem states that, $L^{p}\subset L^{1}\ast L^{p}, (1\leq p <\infty.)$ 

I have been reading the paper on wave equations, and I have some confusion in notations. Consider the initial value problem(IVP)(Wave equation): $\frac{\partial ^2 u } {\partial t^2}(x,t) = \Delta u (x,t), (x,t) \in \mathbb R^{d} \times \mathbb R,$ $u(x,0) =f(x), \frac{\partial }{ \partial t} u(x, 0) =g(x).$ The solution to the above Cauchy Problem is $$u(x,t)=\cos (t \sqrt{- \Delta}f) (x) + \left( \frac{\sin (t \sqrt{- \Delta})}{\sqrt{- \Delta}}g \right) (x)$$ 

The paper (p.9) I have been reading gives hint that one can use this identity, $(|u|^{2}u - |v|^{2}v)(s)= (u-v)|u|^{2}(s)+ v(|u|^{2}-|v|^{2}) (s)$; to prove the contraction, but I am unable to see, and I am wondering how such identity will be useful ? or may be some different method is available ?) Any suggestions or comments or any reference will be helpful to me; thanks a lot; 

Put, $C_{0} (\mathbb R)=\{f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb C: f \text { is continuous on} \ \mathbb R \ \text {and } \lim_{|x|\to \pm \infty}f(x)=0 \}$(= Continuous functions on $\mathbb R$ vanishing at $\infty$) and $A:= L^{1}(\mathbb R) \cap L^{2}(\mathbb R) \cap C_{0}(\mathbb R).$ 

[The paper I have been trying to understand claims that to show solution exists global in time it suffices to prove that Banch space norm $\|u\|_{X}$ cannot become unbounded in finite time. But I do not understand how dose it follows from this. Would you please explain a bit?] [ I am trying to understand Theorem 1.1 (page no.2 and then the proof in page no. 5) in of this paper]. 

I have been reading the paper on nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation(NLKG) for initial data in modulation space: For detail please see the paper "Klein-Gordon Equations on Modulation Spaces (2014)" (side remark: modulation spaces are closely related to Besov spaces and very useful for PDE view point.) And I have been trying to figure out the proof of the following theorem. Theorem 6.(persistence of regularity). Let $1\leq p_{1}<p_{2}\leq \infty$ and $k\in \mathbb N$, $0\leq s_{1} \leq s_{2} < \infty $ and let $u$ be a strong $M^{s_{2}}_{p_{2},1}$ solution to NLKG with its maximal existence interval $I.$ If $u(t_{0})\in M^{s_{1}}_{p_{1},1}$, and $u_{t}(t_{0})\in M^{s_{1}-1}_{p_{1},1}$ for some $t_{0}\in I$ then $u$ is also a strong $M^{s_{1}}_{p_{1},1}$ solution to NLKG with the same maximal interval. 

Let $a, b \in \mathbb R$ such that $ab> 1$ ; put $$L^{1}_{a}(\mathbb R)= \{ f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb C \ \text {measurable} : ||(1+|x|)^{a}f||_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}< \infty \},$$ and $$FL^{1}_{b}(\mathbb R)= \{ f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb C \ \text {measurable} : ||(1+|w|)^{b} \hat {f}||_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}< \infty \}.$$ We consider a Foureier-Lebsgue space, $$FL:=L^{1}_{a}(\mathbb R) \cap FL^{1}_{b}(\mathbb R).$$ My question is: Let $f\in FL$. Can we expect $|f|\in FL$ ; Or we get a counter example ?
