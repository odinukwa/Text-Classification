First off, have you seen your doctor about this? This could be something innocuous like low blood sugar or not being in the best shape to start with. It could also be something considerably more serious. And is it specifically the crunches that cause the dizziness? Do you get the same dizziness if you do a standing crunch (standing upright, hands behind your head, and curling down as if you were doing a crunch on the floor)? Are you breathing throughout the crunch or are you holding your breath perhaps? If you haven't done a lot of abdominal exercise, honestly, it might simply be that you're not in very good shape. Crunches are harder than people give them credit for. If you can't see a doctor, I recommend cutting your number of crunches a little lower for a week or so, say only do 5, or do them from a standing position (assuming those don't make you dizzy). It may feel like you're not getting much exercise, but you're teaching your body to accept it. And make sure that you're breathing as you do it. Don't hold your breath. Lastly, it's possible that you're dealing with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, a disorder that happens from excessive deposits in the eardrum, although that commonly manifests itself with any positioning where your head is not upright, so you probably would be running into it in other situations. If it is BPPV, one option is to switch to other exercises. Planks are recommended in the link above. Getting up to holding it for 60 seconds (and again, don't stop breathing during it) takes most people a bit. Another is treatment by a doctor, and we're back to my initial point. It's better to be safe than sorry. 

The best way to learn is by doing. Of course, the risk with flips is that a) if you don't do them right, it's possible to severely injure yourself and b) doing them repeatedly is risky, because eventually, you will get tired and it makes the odds of doing the flip wrong more risky. You can reduce the incidence of the first case by practicing the flips in a safer place such as on a trampoline, in a gymnastics facility, into a pool, with a spotter, etc. This is not a guarantee of safety but it does reduce risk. As for the latter, the key is to practice up until you start to feel exhausted and then stopping until you feel better. There are techniques that you can do before actually trying the flip, whether to strengthen yourself or to overcome fear. For the former, recommendations include practicing leaping as high as possible and noting the apex of your jump and practicing jump tucks (jumping and tucking without flipping). For the latter, the video I linked has some suggestions involving things like practicing neckbridges to overcome the fear that landing on your upper back will kill you and practicing jumping and landing on all fours (on soft ground) to assure yourself that you can catch yourself midfall. As always, your best bet involves experienced people helping you learn. There are similar exercises for handsprings. I know that, on the back handspring, the tumbling class I attended used a large foam cylinder over which we did a back-bend fairly slowly and evenly, also propping our legs up to make the kickover easier. 

Is he experiencing more muscle there? More fat? Is it just not going away as fast as he'd like? My gut reaction, no pun intended, is that he's taking in more calories than he's burning, which is resulting in weight gain. As to why it's the abdomen, well, you can't target fat-loss or gain. He should probably start charting out his calories consumed to make sure that his bulking powder isn't providing too many calories in addition what he's already eating. If it's muscle, he may want to cut back on exercises that focus on his stomach and abdomen in favor of exercising the rest of the body in hopes of at least hiding what he has in favor of other muscle. 

A general rule of thumb regarding sweating is that, if it's visible and accumulating, it's not doing its job. The purpose of sweating is to cool you by evaporation. Ideally, the sweat is evaporating as quickly as it is produced and you'll barely even notice it. When you have a lot of sweat, when it's streaming down your face and soaking your clothing, you're basically exceeding the ability of the perspiration to cool you. At that point, by manually wiping away the sweat, you're removing the heat-carrying water on your skin, essentially doing the job that evaporation should have been doing for you. So, in short, it's not counter-productive so long as the action of wiping away the sweat isn't impairing your ability to do your workout. 

Cooling of the body largely happens via evaporation of water, whether it's the water in your sweat or an external source. There's an additional cooling that happens when doused with water in that some of the heat is likely to be transferred to the water, which then drips away. On the other hand, you're increasing the amount of weight you're carrying, particularly if you've got absorbent clothing on, and you're increasing the risk of chafing from the wet clothes. On a side note, and partially addressing your edit to include commentary of where you start getting negative effects, sweating works via evaporation. Contrary to the belief of many, being soaked in sweat is not a good thing, because it means that your body can't keep up with the cooling. Ideally, the sweat is evaporating as fast as it comes off of your skin, so you wind up with a faint sheen at worst. Wearing clothing complicates the process because the cloth can trap the moisture and, when you have enough water in the clothing, it acts as insulation, trapping heat in the water on the inner layers. Your body will react to this perceived extra heat by sweating more. If your clothes are already saturated, the water will just drip away, providing some small benefit, but preventing the natural cooling through evaporation. In colder weather, as per your second link, it will also mean loss of proper thermoregulation, and thus an increase of risk of hypothermia, because your body will stop sweating, but the cooling process will continue to occur water is evaporated off of the surface. Ultimately, soaking yourself in water when clothed is a bad idea. Soaking yourself in water where you don't have clothes (c.f. topless runners) might have some minor benefit, but will largely be wasted water. If you're training to run completely soaked (say, someone training for a Tough Mudder-type event, or a soldier training for operations in bad weather), then you get the minor effect of learning to live with the side effects, but that's like discussing the benefits of running with bruised feet. As a postscript, there's a voice in the back of my head saying that pouring water over yourself might also mess with protective oil in your skin, increasing the risk of sunburn and chapping in much the same way that swimming or licking your lips can increase the risk. I don't think that would apply here, since it's a relatively small amount of water that's going down the surface (versus prolonged immersion as in swimming or the pressure of licking one's lips), but it's something to consider. 

Unfortunately, there really isn't a formula, so it's basically a matter of determining your cadence, and then trying to change it and seeing if it works for you. 

Extensive bodyweight exercises and repetition of their art for hours at a time is basically the answer. As noted by Dave above, Christopher Somner's writings are generally considered to be the fundamental word on it. His website can be found here. It's prohibitively expensive to get an actual copy of his seminal work, Building the Gymnastic Body, although you'll find a lot of bootleg copies out there. Ignore the references he makes to future books in there. He scrapped his plans to write them and is now releasing his Foundation Series and associated works for particulars. On a side note, one of the reasons he stated for scrapping the earlier books was that he realized that he was used to training people who were already strong enough to hold their own body weight at arm's length, and had underestimated how huge of a gap existed between the average person and where his book started. 

Actually, Aspartame has a pretty clear bill of health. There were some early studies which suggested that megadoses, the equivalent of slamming 40-50 diet sodas every day, might lead to a slight increase in cancer rates, but better studies have eliminated confounding factors and found that the risk is less than that of using natural sugars in food due to the lower amounts. Looking at the list of ingredients, the only item which might be of potential risk is their source of calcium, which is not listed. Routine calcium supplementation has been associated with increased risk of heart attacks, something not observed in normal dietary consumption. I have not seen any further study of the issue, although my suspicion is that it may have more to do with many of the supplement companies using cheaper sources of calcium such as ground cuttlefish or limestone. Another possibility is the Sodium Bicarbonate pointed out by rrirower above. Based on Wikipedia, it is occasionally called out as an athletic enhancer, but there are potential issues of toxicity at higher dosages. All in all, you should be fine consuming this powder unless you're trying to turn it into your only foodstuff. All things in moderation, after all. 

At least within the context of canned vegetables, draining the liquid and rinsing the vegetables yields a 9-40% reduction in sodium. Although, note that the US Department of Agriculture has also pointed out that draining the can, or rinsing, can reduce the nutrient content, because you're dumping water-soluble vitamins that have migrated into the water. 

Short answer, there are a lot of ways to do a lat pulldown incorrectly. With some supervision, or awareness of one's form, it's not a bad exercise, but it's an exercise where it's easy to fall into bad habits that can hurt you (putting too much pressure on the spine or rotator cuffs) or simply not do you much good (using your stronger muscles to compensate for the weak ones you're really trying to exercise). 

Based on their video, it looks like the entire shoulder is raised, all at once and it goes all the way up. 

Here's an exercise that combines the regular plank position with extending the hips up and down in sort of a combination of Cobra and Downward Dog poses from yoga.
