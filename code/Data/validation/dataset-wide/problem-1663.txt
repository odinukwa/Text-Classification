Strictly speaking, no. The monies appropriated by Congress are an act of law and are thus legal, by definition. However, these appropriations are supposed to be backed by authorizations, and a growing portion of the US federal government's discretionary spending is not backed by authorizations. From the Harvard Law School Federal Budget Policy Seminar paper "Authorizations and Appropriations: A Distinction Without Difference?" (emphasis mine), 

In other words, just because both tobacco cigarettes are and eating processed meat are known to cause cancer does not mean they are equally bad for you. So how bad is eating processed meat? Once again going to the source of that pronouncement, 

The rationale for creating this distinction between authorizations and appropriations was to separate politics (authorizations) from paying the bills (appropriations). The problem is that authorization bills often get bogged down by politics and languish. For example, authorization for the State Department got bogged down by arguments big and small for 15 years. The State Department had no authorization (but most certainly had budget) from 2002 to the end of 2016. The State Department is once again authorized to do its business, at least for a short while, with Senate Bill 1635. This was passed by both branches of Congress and signed into law in December, 2016. Whether the State Department will be reauthorized to exist next year is dubious. Appropriations will still be granted, even if it is not reauthorized. The State Department is but one part of the US federal government. This repeats many times over throughout the US federal government. 

Problem solved? If so, send $1 to Monkey Tuesday.... Binaural beats are appropriately being studied for a variety of reasons, mostly due to the potential effects it may have for patients with cochlear implants, and in an attempt to better understand the relationship between neural activity and sensory perception. They have also been used to understand complex neurological phenomena, such as how the brain communicates with itself. While binaural beats are being studied with regard to sensory perception, there has been no indication that they can significantly alter it (in a manner comparable to DMT or LSD, or even to marijuana) beyond the range in which individual perception is altered (or perceived to be altered) by either meditation or relaxation for an equal amount of time. A study of EEG data regarding binaural beats showed that there is a change in brain wave patterns while being exposed to them. However, the only conclusion the study reaches is that brain wave patterns are different for those listening to binaural beats than those who are not, and that they can be detected by placing electrodes on the scalp. In fact, a study here may indicate that there is little difference between a brain interpreting binaural beats and a brain interpreting acoustic beats. And again, tests like these are done to understand how the brain works, not to illustrate any purported effect. Binaural beats have been tested for efficacy in treating: 

Even if the claim is true, so what? Climate change is about what happens over the course of multiple decades, not over the course of a year or even a single decade. 2006 to 2007 was a weak El Niño event. Except in El Niño years, it's almost always possible to cherry-pick the peak of some previous El Niño event (e.g., February of 2007) as the basis for the false claim that the Earth isn't warming. This has long been a standard ploy amongst climate change deniers. The claim isn't true. The graph used in the question uses the NCEP CFSR / CFSv2 reanalysis tools. Like the date, this represents a bit of cherry-picking. (I'll address that later.) A better source for global temperature anomalies is to use a dataset that targets estimating the global temperature anomaly. Below is a graph for the same time period as the plot in the question, but using the NOAA Global Temperature Anomaly dataset. 

You didn't ask, but the placeholder zero is not a true zero. Even though the Babylonians, Chinese, and Greeks used a placeholder zero, none of those cultures managed to extend the concept of a placeholder zero to something that represents nothing. While we take this use of zero for granted nowadays (even six year olds know what five minus five is), this is a very difficult and very abstract concept. This "true zero" originated in India, but well after Aryabhata's time. Most attribute the development of a true zero to Brahmagutpa. The Mayans came very close to having a true zero, and may have well had that concept. It's hard to tell because of the destruction of all but four four Maya codices during the Spanish conquest of Mexico and central America. What is known is that the Mayans and their predecessors had a base 20 place value notation with a turtle shell representing zero dating to about 2000 years ago.

This quote from journals/cambridge.org shows that when it comes to hard and fast data on language acquisition, we're really still just mining correlations and seeing what pans out. Science is if nothing else a gradual process, though. The folks over at National Science Foundation voice the dilemma well... 

Some common occurrences in head injuries: Concussions The word "concussion" has many different meanings to patients, families, and physicians. One definition:a condition in which there is a traumatically induced alteration in mental status, with or without an associated loss of consciousness (LOC). A broader definition for concussion: A traumatically induced physiologic disruption in brain function that is manifest by LOC, memory loss, alteration of mental state or personality, or focal neurologic deficits. While there are many individual variations, concussions usually result in relatively temporary impairment of neurologic function Again, things are not so clear cut when dealing with concussions, and post-concussion syndromes: 

Black arrows point to subdural bleeding White arrow points to the midline shift of the brain. The build-up of blood in the skull is putting extensive pressure on the brain. Enough bleeding will essentially "crush" the brain, causing the brainstem to herniate. Diffuse Axonal Injury Basically this is extensive damage to the white matter.
