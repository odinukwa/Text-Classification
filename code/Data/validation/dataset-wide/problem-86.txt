Little brainettes However, underlying all of this is a fundamental question that I have avoided so far: is the human race procreating? And if so, how? If not, then are the AIs we create our offspring? Where do little brains come from, and what happens to rest of the body if they are cultivated in the usual way? If brains come from humans that are grown the usual way, then you are left with the remains of that persons body as hazardous waste once the brain and spine has been removed. Taking care of that may be an extremely unpleasant job, and may thus a thankless, mentally scarring job (at the opposite end of an elite job). If brains are grown without the rest of the body, then that raises a whole lot of questions of it's own. However we can then safely say that the field of human medicin that is worth studying would be greatly diminished, thus the workload of medical students would be greatly changed. In this world, much of the mdical field concerned with the body has been supplemented or replaced with technical knowledge from other fields. (Sorry about the lack of references, unfortunately I'm not allowed more than two since I'm new. The question leaves a lot of free variables, which is why I've included a bunch of questions to consider while world-building.) 

Fundamentals of the self Given that artificial bodies and full immersion simulation is the norm, you seem to have a society like Ghost in the Shell wherein the difference between virtual and actual experiences blur together. Specifically I would direct you to the Stand Alone Complex anime (if you haven't already watched it), as it touches a wide range of the same social issues. If the brain is a normal human brain, and it receives the same set of inputs when experiencing the real world through an entirely artificial shell as when it experiences the virtual world, then it stands to reason that many people may ask what the difference is. Many may even choose to forgo the use of an artificial body completely, as the maintainance costs may be prohibitive. Compare this with the cost of owning a car: 

Well... We are kinda seeing it already, are not we? Apart from the robots and real-life necessities taken care of, there are already a multitude of virtual worlds that people flee from real life to. Those worlds are normally created by someone, of course, but all of them are made to give the only thing that your reality really needs for your inhabitants: entertainment. So, what it would be like? The central hub would be a giant second-life environment, where people would interact more-or-less in free form, using avatars of their design. There is no need for your avatar to reflect your real body. Some people, probably the most studied ones - let's call then the Engineers - would be tasked with the creation of new, special worlds. Those worlds have only one purpose, and that would be to make the people that choose to live in them entertained. Think of a civilization that has a multitude of MMO's to choose from, with thousands of possible genres, varying degrees of complexity, and always full of fresh content. People would be able to literally live in Azeroth, Elysea, Asmodae, Rune-Midgard, Faer√ªn, Eberron... you name it. The activities we do today to escape real life would be the bread and butter of your people, and they would live their lives playing what they want to play. People would keep studying and doing whatever they like, but inside the world they love the most. And, if they are tired of the Medieval fantasy of Greyhawk, they can simply move on and become something else in another world, created by another engineer. What you would have is basically the biggest RPG community ever created! 

Everybody would die and the human race would be extinct before getting to the bronze age. Really. If this starts somehow in the middle of the Stone Age, people won't be able to make sex on the speed needed to survive. Your rules regarding pregnancy would kill everyone in a few generations. Women aren't really comfortable to engage in those types of act soon after a pregnancy, and even with modern medicine the recovery time for comfortable intercourse can take up a few months. But, that's not your only problem. Those rules are really hard for someone on the stone age to understand. Most males would simply die out during puberty - for young males, getting a mate is really hard when you have to compete against stronger, older, and more experienced males. Since successful males don't die out, they will keep reproducing with available females - including their own offspring, since females are a really limited resource. That would make inbreeding defects skyrocket, and soon everybody would have serious genetic defects to cope. But, that's not all. Unless you somehow had 9-to-1 female-to-male ratio, your people won't survive two generations. Let's suppose you have about half of your population of each sex, at the start of our experiment. That's the normal ratio for humans, so let's use that. Let's consider only people at reproductive age, at first. Consider that there are around 15 people on a settlement. That's a good number for a stone-age family. From those 15 people, let's suppose that you have 10 adults, 5 of each sex. Once the females get pregnant, and they WILL get pregnant, their death-delaying abilities would be useless and all the males would die in a month. The females would last a few more months, but would die soon after, followed by the children. That's it. 

Water consumption is not directly relatable variable to tree size Tree size, adaptations, and environmental conditions govern a trees water consumption. Environmental conditions and adaptations in particular, one reason trees lose water is to cool themselves down in order to photosynthesize efficiently however this is dependent on its adaptations. This is what makes the difference between a cactus and a mangrove. Quora claims a mature Oak can go through 200 gallons a day I bothered to do the math: your tree needs to consume roughly 648,000 gallons of water in a day. Im all for the stretching the limits of biology but that doesn't sound possible for your select biome. That tree would be making clouds like a rainforest. matter of fact to put this in perspective: 

Sure, there are no guarantees in crust composition of planets. However, one way to certainly reduce composition is to just say it was mined out by another race millennia's ago depriving it of various useful minerals. 

No this isn't possible Here is the contradiction in your scenario. You want the alternate universes to have a big bang and conditions similar to our own. But you want to change the underlying physical laws that resulted in those conditions. If you play with gravity obviously the big bang would not behave the same, as in no stars or all black holes. Instead I suggest skipping playing with physical laws and just jumping into alternate universes composed of exotic matter. Or alternate universes with different time events. Or scrape the notion of having universes that resemble ours in any way and then play with physical laws. As for a human, they are going to need a space suit as oxygen and even pressure are going to be concerns. There is no telling what happens when an object of one universes laws enters a separate universe governed by different laws. Basically, any change in the laws of physics results in likely inhospitable conditions for humans. The laws are so fundamental that they affect just about everything we need. 

Faceless men have to carry faces If you know you are looking for a faceless man (which general knowledge of was expressed in GOT). Authorities would establish a perimeter (like they always do) and search the possessions of anyone trying to leave the perimeter. Obviously the one who tries to fight is the faceless man or the one with a bunch of human faces is the faceless man. Though he would certainly rack up a body count, the flaw of any serial killer is they always give the authorities another chance. IR Cameras A face a faceless man uses is dead flesh that has been put over his own. It is theoretically possible that an IR camera could reveal this discrepancy in real time allowing for quick identification. Dogs As referenced in GOT, in order to make a faceless man's face they must apply certain chemicals to the flesh. You would need to apply some kind of unusual chemical to achieve the life like qualities of their face. These chemicals would most likely be noticeable to a dog's nose. This would not occur in GOT as everyone has bigger concerns than the faceless men to bother with such a method. However, in modern society expenses in training and research would not be spared to apprehend such prolific assassins. 

So overall it's potentially a hassle to even have a body, so if someone could offer you hosting for your brain and spine with a good connection to a general purpose informational exchange network (read Internet) where people can share a virual environment, then that may be preferable to a large group of people. For a real-world example of this, look at how many people and companies are choosing to forgo in-house hosting of web-sites and the like, instead choosing to hand hosting over to dedicated providers. Society: You, me and everybody Of course this also requires that the potential clients trusts the hosting company absolutely, since they have no way protecting or defending themselves in the real world and no way to walk away from the company if they were dissatisfied (if the company won't let them). This leads to a potentially abusive relationship: any company or organization dealing in artificial bodies or conciousness hosting (shells) would hold a lot of power over the individual. This leads to a divergence in the way you might want to handle the society: 

This affects what jobs might be available and what they entail, but since "what would elite jobs be like" is part of the question, I will assume that society operates in an hierarchical fashion and that social advancement along with accumulation of monetary wealth are core goals for the individual. Enjoying yourself is also a goal, and a part of that is meaningful occupation (at work and in your free time). Jobs in Utopia Physical labor can often be left to non-sentient, necessarily intelligent AIs manning specialized (see industrial robots) or generalized bodies. A human touch may be required if the situation is unpredictable, or if there is the need to have someone take on the responsibility in case of failure. This is assuming that there is enough robotic bodies to go around, But since "androids are running the streets" I feel that it is not unfair. More cerebral jobs would be the go-to for humans and human-level AI under this society. It brings up the further question of how to define the abilities and inadequacies of AI with human-level intelligence. This is a part where you might want to take a few liberties, since the best example of a high-profile AI with something approaching human-like intuition would be IBM's Watson. To continue talking about jobs, this also means that a huge segment of the job-market as we know it today disappears. With no "menial" or repetitive work, that only leaves creative and administrative work (e.g. I'd classify being a CEO as a comibination of creativity and administration), along with any other position that requires someone to hold responsibility. This is usually what we consider elite jobs today, so assuming that the majority of people have work like this we'd probably push the difinition to cover the upper echelons of such work: jobs with the most freedom, the most power and (possibly) the most responsibility. Some jobs that might exist: 

With the advent of Legion on World of Warcraft, a iconic weapon from the series came back to the mind of gamers all around the world - the fabled Warglaives. 

Tulips can be used to effectively paint the landscape. If your races are dedicated enough and have some big, wide open areas visible to each other, with suitable flowers, they can paint the surface of their planets to make drawings to each other. This will consume time and space, of course, but hey - if you draw something on your super garden, and the other planet nearby does a similar super garden, you wouldn't be amazed by it and invest more time to it? They will probably need some sort of telescopes to check the gardens of each other, but the sheer cuteness of space aliens talking to each other by gardening already makes me want to write this story! 

Well... you got some stuff not quite right there. Centaurs by no means need to graze. They may be half-horse, but they are also half-humans. More than anything, they would be hunters - excellent hunters, that hunt with the extra speed from a horse and with powerful spears. Digitigrade feet are, to some extent, not that far away from high heels. If you look what some Korean dancers can do on heels, It's totally plausible to see a creature naturally evolved to walk like that. Maybe they need some extra reinforcement on their feet, but it's nothing that humans can't already do with training. It just becomes easier with evolution. Swimmers that use mermaid tails are becoming more and more common. While they are not as efficient swimmers as, let say, sharks, they are far better than regular, "legged" swimmers. Still, that's not quite right you're looking for, it seems. What I did on one my RPG settings: 

New Zealand is exactly like this. Granted, it is a bit bigger than a "small island", but it has a really wide array of environments for one to choose and is a incredibly beautiful place. 

Everybody would die really fast. Those rules will create a impossible setting for life in a modern society. As soon as those rules enter in action, most puberty-aged children will die. That will happens because people won't be able to adapt that fast to a change like this. After this happens, misery will hit every country in the world. Most moms would be devastated by this loss, as will be every father, and people will not really be able to focus on something like sex for a while. I imagine that most parents would just give up and die instead of living in a world like this one. Having your children die for some random event in the universe is pretty hardcore, and it would kill most of the hope on the future in the hearts of everyone. I know that I would be really nervous if I was forced to put my daughters to "mate" with someone because of this. I know that my wife would be really sad if I had to search for other people to avoid dying. Even if we did this, the stress would eventually kill anyone out. I don't think I would be able to ejaculate, even if my life was on the line, if my mind was stressed out about all of this going on with my family. I would be worried to no end in this scenario. I think that my family and I would keep up for a few months, but we eventually would give up. So many dreams shattered and so many pain inflicted to the world would kill all the hope in a nice future. Seeing children die if they don't make sex is not nice. Not nice at all. In the end, I think that my family would just decide to move on and give up. The world is not nice anymore.
