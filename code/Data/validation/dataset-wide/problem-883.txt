Is there any reason why the Earth side of the Moon has enormous plains and mountains, while the far side contains just few small ones inside largest craters? 

As an amateur with limited budget, I'd be interested in taking photos of the night sky, trying to capture more detail than human eye armed with a lens of comparable parameters to what I have in my camera normally could see. I doubt I'd ever get down to details as fine as Jupiter's moons, but I'd hope to see detail of some nebulae I have a hard time seeing through my inexpensive telescope, stars too dim to notice in less-than-perfect conditions etc. I'm interested in taking full-sky images just as well as zooms on specific objects too. Currently, I have a lower-end SLC camera, with two lenses - good sharpness though lower aperture with 50-120mm focal length, and a wide-angle, high-brightness one (about 12-50mm) currently. Firmware hacks allow me to take photos of arbitrarily long time, and I have the remote to start and stop it without touching the camera, and generally software-wise the camera is quite powerful. One of the lenses (the longer focal length) is of "standard professional" quality level too. Is this sufficient to get started? If so, what kind of settings should I use? If not, what other kind of entry-level equipment would I need to obtain/build on budget to get started with night sky photography? 

We know the spectacular explosions of supernovae, that when heavy enough, form black holes. The explosive emission of both electromagnetic radiation and massive amounts of matter is clearly observable and studied quite thoroughly. If the star was massive enough, the remnant will be a black hole. If it wasn't massive enough, it will be a neutron star. Now there's another mode of creation of black holes: the neutron star captures enough matter, or two neutron stars collide, and their combined mass creates enough gravity force to cause another collapse - into a black hole. What effects are associated with this? Is there an explosive release of some kind of radiation or particles? Is it observable? What physical processes occur in the neutrons as they are subjected to the critical increase of pressure? What is the mass of the new black hole, comparing to its neutron star of origin? 

We're fairly aware clusters of galaxies drift apart due to space expansion, which will drive them out of each other's cosmic event horizon eventually, leaving them separate, alone, each a single "body" within its local observable universe with no means to communicate or influence other clusters. The clusters themselves are held together by gravitational binding that keeps them from being internally torn apart by space expansion, at least assuming density of dark energy doesn't increase drastically eventually. What will happen to the cluster though? At first I assumed its black holes will swallow all its available matter, and connect into one single, lonely black hole. But then, neither are black holes ultimately eternal, due to Hawking Radiation, nor do they swallow all the stars, supposedly most stars escaping their gravity well. Well then, what current theories say a local cluster of galaxies will transform into as t→∞ ? 

About 13.1 billion light years. The z8 GND 5296 Galaxy mentioned in the article linked by TildalWave, mere 700 millions years old (after Big Bang) would be the mentioned distance from us for the light to reach us at indicated speed, considering the 13.798 bln years old universe. As we push technological barriers, we keep finding more distant objects. The age of the universe is the hard limit in light years of distance of any observable object - there was nothing to emit light more than 13.798 bln years ago, or respectively, visible from more than 13.798 bln light years away. visible from distance that what was 13.798 bln light years 13.798 bln years ago - or, after adjusting for universe expansion over that time, currently 46.6 billion light years away. Of course, as RhysW mentions, this limit changes over time as the universe ages and grows. The exact rate of growth is 74.2km/sec per megaparsec, or about 0.000000007% per year. I'd say, comparing to our life and current technological progress, an insignificant factor. 

I'm not sure where to attach the moons - some of them are larger than some dwarf planets, some are definitely more asteroid-sized. I guess - whoever decides to answer this, is free to pick where they'd like to include the moons (or maybe to split them between the two classes, say, attaching the ones with hydrostatic equilibrium to dwarf planets, and bundling the rest with the rubble)? 

...or how small can a solar system be, to sustain an Earth-like planet? Sun is not really small, and 1AU is pretty far when you look at orbital radii of exoplanets and size of their stars. How small a star can be, to still provide Earth's equivalent of 1.36 kW/m2 above its own Roche Limit (of Earth-sized planet)? What would the star's diameter and the orbit providing such irradiance be in such a case? I guess a Brown Dwarf wouldn't be enough to give that much within its Roche Limit, meaning any planet receiving enough light would be torn apart by tidal forces, and likely stepping up to smallest Main Sequence stars would step up the energy output enough that a planet at the Roche Limit would be scorched like Mercury, so its orbit would need to be considerably larger... but I don't quite know how to perform the needed calculations. 

(of course I'm also getting temperature graphs up to Pluto distance...) Does anyone have a single complete graph that shows temperature of the Sun from the very middle, to somewhere far out in the corona? One that would show where the peaks appear relative to each other, what size are the regions of temperature to each other - not a tiny slice but a more general image? 

The Moon is tidally locked to Earth - a long time ago it was spinning, but after a time, the spin stopped - two factors stabilizing it: unequal mass distribution creating an equilibrium position where there's one "preferred" axis by which it faces Earth - an attractor, and the dynamic tidal forces acting as stress upon its structure, dissipating the energy - a friction, reducing the rotation speed. So, at one point in time, it would no longer complete a full spin, but instead reverse its turn direction, start spinning in opposite direction, with maximum spin speed around the time where the "preferred" axis faces Earth, then slowing down again, until its spin stops, and reverses direction again - each time the angle smaller as the dynamic forces act against the direction of rotation - but also, with the rotation angle and angular velocity dropping, the value of the dynamic forces dropping. There is a significant apparent wobble caused by the orbit's eccentricity, and possibly some actual continuous wobble, as the result - with the attractor axis missing Earth as result. But is there any long-term oscillation left over from the times when the Moon was spinning - a harmonic motion around its original spin axis, that would likely not be in tune with the orbital period? (I imagine the period of these oscillations would be very long; after all it's about reversing Moon's spin back and forth, by a force that isn't all that strong.) 

Moon can be fully eclipsed by the virtue of being fairly close to Earth. Any body distant enough will not be eclipsed fully, Earth's disc not fully covering Sun's disc. How's that for anything at the L2 point? Will it be lit by Sun's corona or will it bask in deep shadow of Earth? Bonus question: if Umbra does reach there, how large a body could remain fully shaded at L2? What's the Umbra's radius there? 

Moon always faces Earth with one side, its spin period equal its orbital period - this is what we learn at school. But I know Nature rarely operates in absolutes. I'd find it hard to believe Moon wouldn't spin relative to Earth at least very slowly. I searched but found no data other than "doesn't", so I'd like to ask - does the Moon stay turned the same side precisely - or do, over many years, new features show at one edge? If it does, how long would it take to make a full turn? 

original link ...and I can't shake the impression that someone just messed up the placement of the center point of the planet, shifting it about 8km north from where it should be. If the center point was ~8km further south, the north and south altitudes would be roughly the same. Moreover, it's even hard to argue about placement of equator, as the northern pole is about 16km closer to the equatorial plane than the southern - due to the altitude difference. Move the equator and it all evens out. It's fairly hard to believe such a mistake to have persisted so long, so... is there any deeper reason behind this strong asymmetry of the planet, other than just a topographical snafu? 

Since the direction of Vernal Equinox lies in the Pisces constellation, why is its symbol Aries? Shouldn't it be ♓ ? Is this a historical anachronism, only invalidated by axial precession of Earth? 

Could someone give the rough estimates of speeds of our travel through space? I can easily find the two nearby ones: 

Some meteorites just blaze away, streaking through the sky. This is clearly explained, as they either slow down enough for the flame to cease, or ablate in their entirety, turning to vapor. But some, like the Chelyabinsk meteorite, explode violently. What effect is responsible for this? Can it be that with their irregular surface acting as a turbine they enter a spin of increasing speed, and once the centrifugal force reaches a certain level, it causes the meteorite to break apart rapidly, hurling parts of it in all directions at speeds far exceeding its speed so far? 

Not exactly. During either of the equinoxes there is a moment when the line between center of earth and the sun aligns with the equator. This doesn't coincide with prime meridian in any way though; it may happen at any meridian whatsoever that happens to coincide with the line. Of course if it happens the sun is in zenith above prime meridian at that moment, your conditions will be satisfied. But depending on precision you allow, that may be a very short time window. It's all about how precisely you want that to be. Near Equinox Earth tilts by about 0.25 degree of latitude per day, meaning that is the maximum angle by which the line will be off from equator while crossing the prime meridian on the same day as when Equinox happens. 0.25 degree of latitude is about 27 kilometers, so this is the maximum error. Of course on some years, that will be much less, it's just that Earth tilt is correlated with length of year, zenith line crossing of prime meridian is correlated with time of day, and time of day is not really correlated with length of year. 

Earth comes closest to the Sun every year around January 3. Winter solstice is at 21-22 December, merely some 12-13 days away. That means projection of Earth rotation axis onto the plane of its orbital movement almost overlaps with its orbit's semi-major axis; the axial tilt direction coincides with the direction Earth orbit is elongated. I couldn't find corresponding data regarding other bodies in the Solar System. Is this merely a coincidence, or is there a regularity, with direction of the axial tilt coinciding with eccentricity of the orbit? How does that look like in case of other bodies than Earth? 

The mentioned 100 million years is the period of the star being in its stable (well, as stable as the turbulent T Tauri type stars get) state without nuclear fusion. Then, once the fusion starts, we get between 3 million and hundreds of billions years of main sequence, depending on mass of the resulting star. What I'm interested is how long is the period of transition between the two - ignition of the nuclear reaction - time between "all energy produced by gravitational contraction" and "most of energy produced by nuclear fusion". I imagine this period could be quite short, and the effect quite rapid and turbulent as the initial fusion increases local temperature (and as result pressure) drastically, leading to conditions conductive for fusion spreading rapidly over the volume which is already on brink of entering the fusion everywhere within the protostar, essentially a nuclear wildfire encompassing the gathered gas, a chain reaction starting. Am I right in my guess this process is rather rapid? Was it ever observed? Or contrary, does the intensity of the fusion reaction rise gradually and slowly from zero over many millions years of star formation? 

No. Space expansion doesn't slow down, unlike the expansion of cosmic horizon. That means the cosmic horizon actually swallows galaxies as they travel away from us due to space expansion, reducing their number instead of increasing it. Nevertheless, we still haven't gathered all cosmic radiation from Big Bang that occurred within our current event horizon, so it's still a good while before it begins restricting distance of observable universe for us - currently the speed of light (+space expansion rate) vs age of the universe limits it to a considerably smaller radius. Yes, we discovered more stars and galaxies, but that is due to improvement of technology, which is still quite far (roughly a third of the way) from observing stars near the Hubble Sphere as the universe formed (ones whose light would be observable today; as opposed to these at the space horizon, whose light will reach us eventually, in infinitely distant future.) 

The radius of the black hole would be (3x10^5 cm) x ( 5.2 ) = 15.6km The 3.2Msun Neutron Star of this density would have volume of 1.08 x 10^13 m^3 which gives radius of 13.7 kilometers According to Shell Theorem, spherical objects' gravity field strength at given distance is the same for spheres as for point masses so at the same distance from center of same mass (point - black hole, sphere - neutron star) the gravity will be the same. That would put the surface of the neutron star below the surface of event horizon of equivalent black hole. Yet I never heard about even horizon of neutron stars. Either I made a mistake in my calculations (and if I did, could you point it out?) or... well, why?
