Concentrate on keeping a rigid back as you lift the bar up. Pull all the slack out of your body before initiating the pull. And add more weight. 

It's important to gain muscle for weightlifting. Fat doesn't lift things, but higher overall mass can provide a more stable foundation for lifts. In case you are wondering, you can get too fat to perform the lifts properly. In an ideal world, you will start lean (in the 10-12%), and dial things down when you edge up towards 15% body fat as a man. Add at least 5% body fat if you are a woman. That said, different rep ranges target a higher proportion of different types of muscular adaptation. All are necessary to getting stronger, and over time you'll probably alternate your focus. 

An alternate form of curl that is easier on your elbows is the hammer curl. It's worth doing while you are rehabing the elbow. If you were only using the empty bar for curls before, you can load with dumbbells that below that weight. You will need to increase the pressing work. Particularly because you have both chin-ups and curls in your routine. You should be able to press more than you curl, but keep the reps in the 15-20 range. This has the benefit of moving more blood through the joint and flushing out the inflammation. If you alternate flat bench, incline bench, and overhead press you will hit everything from different angles. 5 sets of 15-20 reps of any pressing movement a day for 5 days in a week with relatively light weight will be a good place to start with the rehab. If you are weighting your chinups this is a time to do strict body weight. Additionally, if you can I would switch to pull ups (palms away) while you are rehabbing, and then alternate chin-ups and pull ups afterwards. If you can't do strict pull ups yet, do 4 sets of 8 pull up negatives (just a slow controlled descent). The different orientation will help the weaker muscles in your forearm to catch up and work your grip differently than the barbell curl and chin ups do. 

These might give you enough variation that you can build size. It might be worth using the leg press to determine if you can increase the usable range of motion over time. As with any time you are dealing with an injury or post-surgery take your time getting back in the gym. Start much lighter than you normally would, and build up weight even more slowly than you would normally. Reiteration: Please seek the advice of someone who really knows their stuff with hip related problems. A good physical therapist can help you regain as much use of your hip as is possible. 

With either type of bar, once you get into the training and competition bars, the bar strength is measured in PSI. The higher the PSI rating, the more weight the bar can handle as it moves through the air. A minimum rating for a quality barbell will be about 155K. Best for Olympic lifts would be 195K or higher. These bars will be able to hold more than 1000lbs while being used. The bars that don't publish PSI ratings and claim over 1000lbs load only measure that load with the bar in the rack. Bottom line, if you are just starting out, you can get a decent starter kit of an Olympic style bar with 300lb of weights for roughly $300 USD (check Amazon). If you scour Craig's List, you might be able to find a really good deal. If you really get into barbell weight lifting, you can invest in a good bar when you are ready for it. Until then, you just need to by a pair of weight plates if you max out your 300lb starter kit. 

I think you'll find that if you find a way to be active every day, your energy levels will rise to meet those demands. Also, getting your blood pumping does wonders for helping you stay alert and think more clearly. 

The only thing that changes when you add a belt is that you are trying to fill the belt with your breath--you still have a responsibility to brace your back. Anything you can do to strengthen your core will also help. 

Without knowing your gender, starting weight and goal weight, it's hard to know if this is reasonable or not. However, there are a couple warning flags that I see here. You want to preserve muscle, and possibly build more if that's OK. Diet Looking at the proposed diet, you have roughly: 

Folks who train for mass emphasize the sarcoplasmic hypertrophy range because it takes up more room. Whether you want to be bigger or you want to be stronger, you will need to emphasize both over time. Keys to getting more mass: 

With a difference of only 1 kg of body weight, that's a rather impressive transformation. Congratulations! Problem is the BMI didn't reflect the hard work you put in. BMI was designed as a statistical device to determine the average obesity of a population. It was never intended to be applied specifically to a population of one. The problem is that body fat is very difficult to measure or even estimate (accurately), and BMI requires only junior high school math skills to calculate. Unfortunately insurance companies and doctors tend to use this simple measure because it really doesn't require any thought. They are just trying to determine risk, and for most people BMI is good enough. 

Testosterone and growth hormone are both known to cause muscle growth and make good use of the amino acids and proteins you have in your body at the time. Note that these are normal hormones produced and managed by your body, not steroids added to cause you to artificially take in more protein. (along with their side effects) The studies I have read have conflicting things to say about timing the protein, and the best I can surmise is that the usefulness of the protein depends on your level of training/adaptation and the population that the studies used. There are many variables that can affect protein absorption and unfortunately, no-one has a clear understanding of how they all interrelate which compromises the usefulness of the studies. By splitting your protein intake throughout the day, you are spreading the odds that you will be at a peak protein consuming time. Not to mention that some of the protein absorption depends on your natural circadian rhythms. In short you will have some times of the year where you make better use of it than others. If you overthink this, you'll drive yourself nuts. And yes, hydration assists the body in processing protein. 2 L a day is an absolute minimum, better 3+ L a day. In the interest of full disclosure, all water content hydrates. 

I'd be hesitant to believe that your Achilles tendons are to blame. The only kid I know to truly have that problem was constantly on his tip-toes before his surgery. Even now he has a hard time changing how he walks and runs because he's been like that so long. However, flexibility can be an issue. This article explains roughly what I did to perform some squat rehab myself. In preparation to fix your squats, I recommend getting a couple pieces of training equipment: 

Once you've rehabbed the knee, you can resume a nice balanced program that incorporates both anterior and posterior work for your legs like squats. Just make sure that your form isn't going to reintroduce the problem. Post rehab you'll want to make sure of the following things: 

These are all the restorative functions that are necessary to allow your body to repair itself in a stronger state, clear out built up waste products, etc. Your body is designed to have a bit more time in the parasympathetic state particularly during sleep. Sleep is probably one of the most restorative things your body can do. What does all this mean? Basically, when you are in a stressed state, your sympathetic nervous system is in control. Practically this means: 

The three test subjects were a beginner, intermediate, and advanced bodybuilder. The advanced bodybuilder did not receive much affect. Androsolve is a non-steroidal "testosterone booster". Products in this class fail to increase your testosterone much above normal. If you have low testosterone levels (T levels), a blood test at your doctor can tell you that, then the product may work. Although, if you typically eat a very low fat diet, simply increasing saturated fat intake can bring your T levels to normal. Other than that, most studies I could find indicate that testosterone boosters as a class of supplement provide at best inconclusive results. The only proven way to increase T levels above normal is to use steroids, which has its own risks. 

Your spine and shoulders should be fine, the biggest risk is to the knees. In particular, running with any kind of weights (vest, ruck sack, etc.) puts much more stress on your knees. If you have bad running form, it's even more of a problem. Some quick points to think about: 

As to preventing it in the first place, it's going to require some coordination with a physio to discern what specifically is going on. I will say that the most common cause of hamstring strains are due to weak hamstrings because they are not regularly exercised. However, the most common cause of pectoral strains is due to technique. That may or may not apply in your specific case. When exercising or performing sports: 

To answer that question requires some basic understanding on how muscles grow. Strengtheory has a good article that provides the basics. The short answer is that it depends. Whether 5x5 will build strength and muscle for you depends on: 

How to Decide Programming is the discipline of looking at your goals and developing a plan to meet them. There is as much art as there is science when making these choices. The best bet is to make a plan, test it out for a month or so, and make adjustments as you learn how your body responds to that type of training. It's also important to realize what works today may need adjustments later on due to your body's adaptation to the training. While there are several program templates out there to help meet your goals, you still need to understand the pros and cons to decide if that is what you want to do. The choice to superset, or when to superset is entirely up to you. It's important to keep in mind that you don't have to always do one method or another. 

Keep an eye on the wrist only HRM options over the next couple of years. Right now, they are good tools for runners, and the manufacturers are aware of the challenges with using them for other activities. The technology will catch up, it's just a question of how soon. 

In terms of stretching the biggest risk isn't the muscle, but the connective tissue (ligaments and tendons). Overstretching that hurts the tendons will produce tendinitis, same as lifting heavy weights with improper form. However, you are correct in that some forms of stretching will affect muscle size and adaptation. Certain forms of dynamic stretching, such as the Sumo wrestler's stomp movement while help strengthen and improve your adductor muscles among others in your legs. I wouldn't expect large improvements in size though. The goal of stretching is to improve your range of motion. The most bang for your buck is when you work your muscles hard, and they get bigger during recovery. The process of warming up your muscles also warms up the connective tissue so that it is less prone to injury. When connective tissue is overstretched, you have an appreciable amount of pain. Additionally, the joints become loose, and easily injured or hyper-extended. The net result is absolutely not what you want because it will force you to stop lifting until you fully recover. 

Eventually Arnold used the weight room to win the world titles for bodybuilding. But the bottom line is both help you achieve your goal. Use Both To Good Effect There is nothing wrong with focusing on 3-4 main lifts a week, and using body weight exercises for all the assistance work. It's a very potent combination to help you use the inherent advantages of each to achieve your end goal. Wendler's 5/3/1 program even has a variation where all the assistance work is calisthenics. 

I remember reading a long time ago that it's less about a potassium/magnesium deficiency and more about an imbalance between those minerals and sodium. What the article you linked to fails to recognize is the involvement of those minerals in the muscle itself. It's not sweated out because it is used as your muscles work. 

I'm going to preface this with the fact that I am not a physical therapist, nor am I a personal trainer. Before embarking on any type of exercise regimen, I do recommend you talk to your doctor and quite possibly get a physical therapist if you (or your family) can afford it. The good news is that it seems like your condition is not degenerative. My daughter's friend has a rare form of MS that inhibits the body's ability to rebuild muscle after exercise. He also needs help getting up if he falls. Based on the general description of what you have, and a quick reading of what Amyoplasia is, working the lower body is going to be a challenge. This is why I recommend a physical therapist. They may be able to help you compensate better for the limitations in your range of motion. Aerobic Training It sounds like several forms of aerobic training just aren't going to work for you. That means you'll have to be a lot more creative. Here's the good news: the heart doesn't know whether you are using your legs or your arms to move. It just knows it has to pump more blood. You just need to get your heart rate up, but still be able to talk while exercising. A couple possibilities would be: 

You may not be lifting heavy weights just yet, but by the time you exhaust the gains from Starting Strength, you will be. The biggest thing you have to realize about dedicated lifting shoes is that what makes a good lifting shoe is terrible for the other things you want to do. They have opposing goals. Lifting Shoe Requirements: 

There are conflicting reports from scared moms associations to killer sergeant coaches that add a lot of misinformation to the mix. I ran across an article by Dr. Lon Kilgore that has some sane guidelines, and while it was written from the perspective of weight training I think it has good implications elsewhere: "Weightlifting for Special Populations: Youth". There's a companion article to this from the same author: "Misconception About Training Youth". Some of the points raised are: 

It's called Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS), and is a natural consequence of changing either intensity or volume on anything you are doing. It's temporary, and once you get used to the new regular workload you won't get it anymore. It has no effect on your ability to train or carry any risk of injury. It's simply uncomfortable. 

These are two sides of the same coin, and it can show how two radically different training styles using the same measurements can be equally valid depending on how you define the reward. At it's simplest view in this context: 

Carbs and fats mixed together can cause you to put on weight--so limit it once per day and avoid mixing them when you can Carbs take up to 12 hours to process, so eat them later in the day so you don't have a rush of energy when you should be sleeping Carbs in the morning and evening meals give you the rush of energy when you are awake and can use it. The fun day is there to throw your metabolism off to keep it from adapting to your normal diet (and having the pounds creep back up). The no-carb day is there to compensate for the fun day.
