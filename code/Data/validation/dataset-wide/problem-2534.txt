"Careful, not for a means of material gain, I will explain the Dhamma." This is my translation of "Na āmisantaro kathaṁ kathessāmîti paresaṃ dhammo desetabbo" found in the Udayi Sutta (AN 5.159), which states five prerequisite qualities of one who teaches/explains the Dhamma. Other translations: "The Dhamma should be taught with the thought, 'I will speak not for the purpose of material reward. ($URL$ “I WILL TEACH THE DHARMA NOT FOR THE SAKE OF MATERIAL GAIN" - Piya Tan ($URL$ A Buddhist monk is required to reject offerings received as a 'payment' for teaching the Dhamma, as the Buddha did in the Kasi Bharadvaja Sutta SN 1.4. 

Summer, I am sorry to read about your hostile encounters with Buddhists. There are about 400 million people who claim to be Buddhists, give or take a few million. For some it's a conscious choice yet for many it's the environment that they were born into, much like a person would have a greater chance of being a Muslim if born in Saudi Arabi or a Catholic if born in Brazil. To learn more about the Buddha's teaching you might be better served online, unless you have access to a learned compassionate teacher. There are many site like accessto insight.org and dharmafarer.org. Personally i have found challenging Buddhist doctrine not an issue, but challenging Buddhist culture does provoke a different response. Buddhists would do well to remember these words of the Buddha found in the Brahmajala Sutta DN1 "If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Sangha, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart. For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If you were to become angry or upset when others speak in dispraise of us, would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?" May you be happy. 

What texts would you recommend for sutta discussion sessions, where a majority of the participants will be new to discussing suttas? with metta 

Friend Suminda, The bodily fabrication, i.e. the in & out breath, is said to calm considerably as one progresses through the first 3 steps mentioned in the Anapanasati Sutta, and it does. The first 2 steps, requires an evaluation of the breath (not control it), to help the mind be mindful of the breath, and take it as it meditation object. 

Can you please elaborate as to what you meant by "Sometimes I feel that my consciousness is separate from my body." In the Dhamma 6 types of consciousness are mentioned, the eye consciousness, ear, taste, smell, body, and mind. Thus, substituting 'eye consciousness' to your statement above, would mean that you are able to see your body from the outside, i.e. you were able to look at your body as if looking at someone else's body. Therefore if you can help elaborate your state, then your following questions of 'How can this be explained in Buddhism? What is this state ?' could be better addressed. May you be well and happy. 

This is not a direct answer per se, but I hope that you can find an answer within it. Acknowledging the absence of a dear one and remembering their good qualities are different things from dukka. It would be a good meditation to see at which point this acknowledgment & remembrance turns to dukka, and investigate the causes - you may find that this dukka is due to remorse, broken expectations, etc. Yet for one who has nothing to feel remorseful, has no expectations, the absence is felt, but there arises no dukka. 

Anxiety/worry taken together are one of the five "nīvarana" in the Buddha Dhamma. "Nīvarana" are states of mind that conceals, hinders, covers, prevents the understanding of the true nature things. Restlessness (uddhacca) and worry (kukkucca) 

You may find the Apannaka Sutta MN 60 (A Safe Bet) helpful to answer your question. Here the Buddha talks about the benefits of not rejecting the possibility of rebirth. "As you have not found an agreeable teacher, you should adopt and practice this safe-bet teaching, for this safe-bet teaching — when accepted and adopted — will be to your long-term welfare & happiness. "And what is the safe-bet teaching? $URL$ 

Perhaps not in London but not too far away are two monasteries well worth the trip. Amaravati ($URL$ Cittaviveka ($URL$ There is also London Buddhist Vihara (www.londonbuddhistvihara.org/) closer to home. 

Why do you assume getting REM during meditation is a good thing? Buddhist meditation is about stilling/calming the mind and body, about contemplating the truths to break free from the ten fetters. Getting REM and the eyes hurting is more distraction and suffering. When humans get REM in sleep, they are unaware of such REMs. Instead they usually are external signs that the person asleep is dreaming. For a person to be consciously be aware of his/her REMs during Buddhist meditation session is not a desired goal or experience. Therefore I would have to say no, its not a good thing. 

Masturbation does not transgress the 3rd precept. Yet, pursuing thoughts of sexuality is considered unskillful as they contribute to further becoming (bhava), which in turn leads to further dukkha. However, long term forced sexual repression only for the sake of keeping a precept is also counterproductive. I have met a few people who have decided to be brahmachari while living a household life and developed very negative and hostile views towards women. Sexual desire should be uprooted from the root with wisdom and compassion, not suppressed because of a rule. Monastics have to abstain from all sexual activity. This is extremely difficult for the average man. This requires a proper environment, internal (mind) and external, proper preparation, developing proper views and thoughts, and proper support. For lay people, the Buddha recommended abstaining from all sexual activity including masturbation, any sort of entertainment, at least once a week by under taking the Uposatha precepts. 

A kills B, B kills A (in the next life), now we are all square is not how kamma works. Kamma is a complex subject, guesstimating its effects in detail is said to lead to futile mental fatigue. One's thoughts and intentions matter. 

The Sankha Sutta is one of the best sutta's I know of that provides instructions on how to transcend and overcome the effects of past unskillful kamma. $URL$ 

Suttas in relation to Nakula Matha and Nakula Pita will be helpful. They wanted to be husband and wife in the next life as well and the Buddha instructed them how to do so :) $URL$ Hope this helps even a little. May you be happy 

Now beings born on earth mostly see beings coming to existence due to a mother and father. Most will never see a "spontaneously reborn being". So how does one form the view that there ARE spontaneously reborn beings when one has never seen such beings? Or is it adequate to simply not reject the possibility of the existence of such beings, but not form the view that there are such beings? Also, if one has the view that there is a mother and father, how does one reconcile these 2 views with the view that there are spontaneously reborn beings, which we are also told are born without a mother and father? Further, say if all the beings we encounter were born spontaneously, how can we form the view that there is a mother and father? Or do the words mother and father mean something other than the biological parents or the first pair of primary carers, e.g. DP verse 294? Why is this view included in the 10 wrong views? The other 9 views does provide a framework for beings to avoid evil and do good. Rejecting this wrong view and accepting its opposing view that there indeed ARE spontaneously reborn beings requires a stretch of the imagination for many. What is the moral purpose? 

My question is mainly to monks and nuns in this group, but I welcome answers from others as well. If one were to give up eating solid food after the midday, as instructed by the Buddha to his Bhikkhu and Bhikkhuni, what practical advice would you give such a person in order to avoid getting gastritis and stomach ulcers? 

Now the 'who' is a concept which the dhamma explains is formed by viewing the aggregates either collectively or individually as mine, I, myself. Yet in the absence of these 5, conceptualizing a 'who' is impossible. Thus the concept of the 'who' dependent on 5 changing, inconstant, processes, that arise and pass away. Thus the 'who' too is changing, inconstant, arises and passes away, and a process. Therefore the view, the belief, that there is a permanent, unchanging 'who', an 'I', a 'mine', a 'self' is a false view, a false belief. 

According to the Buddha, confessing one's misdeed, seeing the fault and blameworthiness in that misdeed, and resolving not to transgress again is considered a maturing, a growth in a person. So too is the ability to accept that confession, forgive the person and harbour no malice. I hope your husband understands the hurt he has caused you after making a solemn vow of fidelity, and that he has resolved to never do that again. Now that you have decided to continue stay married, the Dhamma would tell us to let go of thoughts such as 'he cheated on me, he lied to me, he betrayed me'. For holding on to such thoughts will not allow you to find peace and move forward. Re Dhammapada verses 3 and 4. I did a search on Google a little while ago and according to the results the estimate is that 30% of married men will. Ofcourse the results will vary based on location. I am currently in Sydney. Also some studies have shown that 1 in 4 or even 1 in 3 marriages end in divorce. So relationships are risky business, but they can be rewarding too. People make mistakes. However having the maturity to, admit the mistake, have the insight to see the error in it, and forgive and continue to move forward together lovingly is the Buddhist way, but it takes two. If one party is continually failing to hold up their part, the Buddha says it's better to live alone, our find suitable companions. Also even in relationships we are adviced to practice being an island unto ourselves. For all meetings end in parting. I recall watching a talk by Ajhan Brahm on this topic some time ago. Perhaps you might find that useful. No matter what you do, don't live in regret and with thoughts of anger. In addition you will find it useful developing the practice of the 5 daily recollections recommended by the Buddha. $URL$ I wish you well. 

Aware that the in-breath is long one breathes in / aware that the out-breath is long one breathes out Aware that the in-breath is short one breathes in / aware that the out-breath is short one breathes out 

Yes, and could also be caused by the other 2 unwholesome roots as well. Anxiety can be due to a state of conflict. The mind in a fight or flight situation. Or caused by a state of desire, an expectation, or a state of ignorance. Restlessness and worry are painful states of existence. You can find more about the 5 Hindrances here and recommendations on how to overcome them. May you be happy. 

We read about young children in certain countries being kidnapped, then trained as soldiers to kill and harm others with guns and knives. Despite their young age, and been brain washed to destroy life, these young children nonetheless commit grave unwholesome kamma. Then some of these children go on to be leaders within such armies, forcibly recruiting other children. While Buddhist doctrine attribute being born into such environments as a result of past kamma, it stresses the importance of cultivating compassion towards all, and that everyone has been born in similar situations in the past. Also, if not vigilant we could once again end up in those situations again. To me, the hell guards in the nirayas are similar to such children. They seem to have no/little choice in the matter, than to inflict suffering upon others. Perhaps, like the occasional child soldiers that we read about, that are fortunate to escape such hells on earth, become rehabilitated and go on to help others, there could be some hell guards who do escape. In Mahayana Buddhism there are stories of Bodhisatvas who travel to hells to save those in hell, both guards and prisoners. Much like some people we see on earth. In Buddhism a person's fate is rarely sealed. A spark of dhamma, be it a wise word, a kind deed, could be enough to set a being on the path of liberation. So have compassion towards all, the punished and the punisher. Samsara is full of dangerous environments. 

Downloading someone else's hard work and using it for your benefit without compensating them to me is a form of stealing in my opinion. Some other Buddhists think its only 'copying' and hence not stealing. That's a discussion which is continuing on another thread. For arguments sake, lets consider it stealing for now. We then realize that people are sometimes compelled to steal. Does a war prisoner who is starving commit negative kamma by 'stealing' an apple from his well fed prison guard? Sometimes in samsara people end up in dangerous places and situations, where people have to break the precepts just to survive. In such instances someone who has come into contact with the dhamma has to accept that they are doing is unskillful, reflect on the dangers of that unskillful act, as well as the dangers of coming into existence which led one to such a situation. If we justify the wrong doing and say that it is right, we then fall into even graver negative situation of perpetuating wrong view. For the Buddha says that all that who have attained to the path leading to Nibbana do so with right view. So understand why you are doing it, what compels you to do it. Are there alternatives? Can you prevent doing it in the future? Can you 'cover up' the wrong deed by doing good deeds? Say once you learn English and improve yourself, use that knowledge to help others. Perhaps later once you are able make a donation to the company or person from whose material you benefited from. I also highly recommend the Sankha Sutta which explains how positive skillful kamma can negate past negative unskillful kamma. Hope this helps.
