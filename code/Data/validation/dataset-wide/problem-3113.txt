One key-point to note is that, during this period, the nobility was not a monolihic block. In fact many did participate openly in support of curtailing the King's powers (Robespierre), which is not the same as abolishing the monarchy (which only happened later). Others chose to try to moderate the demands of the bourgeoisie (especially the Jacobins), who were the leaders of the Third Estate. In any case, the Revolution was not directed at anyone in particular, neither the monarch nor the nobility (during the initial phase anyway). This was during the Enligthenment (equality, rationality, etc), hence it was very much a worker's revolt (as opposed to anti-monarch/anti-noble).

Question: How, if at all, is published revisionist history publicly addressed by scholars and academia? The truth is nearly all history is revisionist -- because every historian has learnt their history from someone else and added his/her own view, with the exception of first-hand (direct) experience. On 'publicly addressed', historians look at book reviews like everyone else (usually in journals, not popular press, if it's for specialist books). One has to be careful walking into the debate about whether any scholarly work is Politically Correct revisionism because it is often abused. It often speaks more of the accuser than the historian whose work is being subjected to criticism. Book reviews from fellow historians are particularly useful in such cases. I don't think most everyone in History SE would qualify as a historian, but witness how often such claims are made (in comments).

Berke's fights with Hulagu had nothing to do with the Mamluks. That's another totally different issue re Chinggisid dynastic issues. The Mamluks just took advantage of the situation/confusion when the giants collided. p.s. Most of the Wikipedia entries on Mongol history are generally out-dated (or wilfully misleading in some cases) 

This answer focuses on the casus belli, the cause for Swedish participation in the Barbary Wars. Quoting James L. Cathcart, Monticello.org states: 

Historical Explanation Instead, I will adopt a historical approach and try to answer your stated question, "What point was Rousseau trying to make in "The Social Contract (1762)"? in your original post. The simplest approach is to view The Social Contract (1762) chronologically because Rousseau wrote two earlier essays (also known as First Discourse in 1750 and Second Discourse in 1754, see below). His first and second Discourse was somewhat anthropological because he argued, in the First Discourse, individuals were living blissful lives in isolation and they 'progressed' to a community/society that was corrupted by jealousy (especially by the introduction of private property), in the Second Discourse. Chronology of Rousseau's philosophical work (not exhaustive): 

Again, naturally, the next question that follows is -- how do we know they lived there (West Asia) and (in my mind, more important) where did they come from?. We know where the Scythians lived because of elite burials, especially in the Kuban region. This is archaeology, not linguistics, and we now have physical evidence of the Scythians. Where did they come from? My answer is Central or East Asia and this seems to be key difference between TED and my answer. Instead of relying on Wikipedia, I will show 2 different works from 2 respected scholars -- a historian and an archaeologist -- and both placing early Scythians and Oğuric-speaking Turks in Central or Eastern Asia (along the Eurasian steppe corridor): 

Given your role as an educator, can I assume you are sufficiently aware of the endless debates on social contract and this useful package on Rousseau? Obviously, we are not here to discuss Enlightenment philosophies but it provides a framework to view this answer (a certain perspective). The short answer is: Yes, there were. The steppe nomads (semi-nomads, to be more precise). The caveat is you must agree with the work of Dr David Sneath because he made this argument in his book, The Headless State - Aristocratic Orders, Kinship Society, and Misrepresentations of Nomadic Inner Asia (Columbia University Press, 2007). From the site introduction (same link above) of the book - emphasis mine: 

This question is very close to a previous question, Who were the Huns and/or Xiongnu?, but I hope it is clear that I'm not asking the same point. In fact, I'm asking about the common assumption such as the one held by that earlier question, by asking explicitly: Why do we believe (or on what basis make the assertion) that the Huns were the Xiongnu? 

What I believe OP is looking for, is not really definitions of fiat currency/money, but understanding how societies functioned before the invention of fiat money. Hence, the alternate system of barter in the question title. 

Not directly relevant to this question of whether they occupied Hainan but Kublai Khan was in the South China Sea during his second invasion of Dai Viet (1287). I'm going to try to provide a bit more context here because the Mongol Navy is largely unknown (less popular), compared with their armies on the steppes. After conquering the Song dynasty, Kublai Khan named his Yuan. But during this 15-year war in southern China, they faced many obstacles. Not least of which is the geography, including novel weather, mountains and waterways. It wasn't easy as they fought two more armies -- Pagan (Upper Burma) and Dai Vet (northern Vietnam), in addition to the Song. Since Mongols were originally land-locked people, they had no real ability with the large rivers of Yunnan, and certainly could not navigate Yangtze & Han rivers. But they learnt to, and with help from Song defections (pirates actually), they finally found their footing. Kublai's invasion of Japan in 1274 & 1281 were both failures (blame it on the weather!). There are many reasons why the Navy failed (historians doing what they do, will always find new, more pertinent info) but it's obvious they failed to conquer Japan. And everyone here know this. What is less known however, is their campaigns against Dai Viet and Champa. For Kublai's second invasion of Dai Viet in 1287, they sent a huge armada* -- the Yuan Navy --- via the South China Sea (Bien Dong) route. It did not go well, they basically lost control of their logistics (support ships) and starved themselves including the land contingent (Prince Togan attacked south via the land route). As for the Mongol Admiral, General Omar Batur -- he was caught, imprisoned and eventually drowned (long story on this one). *Huge armada (500 warships) -- here's the full quote (source provided below): 

Farfanes - Christian Knights as Mercenaries (for Muslim Rulers) Mainly in the Maghreb but it was not ad-hoc. In other words, it was institutionalised - emphasis mine: 

That quote (in the question) is a reference to spoils of war, of non-fighting units. If it did include booty of fighting units, it should have had horses because the Ottoman military had horse-cavalry, i.e the sipahis (cavalrymen):

In other words, Scythians may have settled in the Pontic-Caspian steppe, but they migrated there, from the paragraph above, from the Altai-Sayan region. 

As Mark said earlier: " a consequence of shifting internal factions in a society that is at the limit of the ability of the political institutions to create and manage a group", this is about leadership and rewarding the team (i.e. statehood and governance). Social Anthropology+:This topic is normally beyond me, so I have to go find details and source. If you are looking for a book about socio-economic systems of nomadic pastoralism culture, I'd recommend Professor Anatoly Khazanov's book,"Nomads and the Outside World" (University of Wisconsin Press; 2 edition, 1994). Prof Khazanov formalised the extended definition of nomadic pastorlism (still in use). So, to recap and end, there is a Mongol custom and classification that is highly nuanced when it comes to raiding - i.e. cattle raids & war-band raids. Because of this, they do not have to kill-off (exterminate) everyone of the losing side -- much depends on the context. The immediate example I can think of is, even during the dynastic fights between Jochid and Toulid ulus, Berke and Hulegu were not at full-massacre mode (i.e. not killing-off each other, it was a minor-raid), as these passages show: 

Subsequent paragraphs are focused on the evolution of roads and pathway in each region, such as Africa, Egypt, Greece, Rome, etc. FURTHER READING (from book) 

I cannot find any information on estimates of Muslim population circa 1800 to 1850, but hopefully the range of total population might come in useful. Your estimated Muslim population of 13% is extremely close to Government of India's (2001 Census Data) estimate: 13.4%. 

I believe most answers above are pretty good, so I don't have much more to add. On the missing part (in above answers) to cave art, from the question: "... paleolithic cave paintings?" and OP's comments asking for images. This is from Aurignacian period (considered Upper Paleolithic), the specific site is Cave of Pont d’Arc (UNESCO). Wikipedia's entry on this site. 

Additional Info on Japanese Plans during Pacific War (WW2) The official Japanese plan for the Indian operation was Operation C. I have heard mention of Japanese IGHQ -- in Victory fever mode after the easy wins over Hong Kong (X'mas Day 1941), Singapore (Feb 1942), and Manila -- decided to expand the newly acquired empire and include taking over Ceylon (see also OP's comments below asking for this info) but I have never actually read an official history per se. In my mind, instead of Ceylon, I think the most likely explanation was changes by Imperial Japan (IGHQ) for other major targets, namely:
