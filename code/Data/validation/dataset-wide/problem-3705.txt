While machines can provide the advantage of not requiring a “spotter”, don't make the mistake of assuming that they are injury free. Any exercise, if done incorrectly, can injure you. 

What you describe is a variation of a training technique known as strip sets. Again, strips sets are another mechanism that can be used for training variation. One common way to perform them is to perform each set to “failure”, then, strip some of the weight and immediately perform another set. That way, you are able to increase training volume while trying to move beyond the point of failure. This is not to be confused with super setting because the same exercise is still being performed. I can’t stress enough the importance of training variation to avoid plateaus. Strip sets are just one of the methods you can use to avoid them. 

In the short term, no you should not feel any adverse effects from a bout of illness. However, if it becomes a chronic condition, that may lead to muscle deterioration as your body is constantly In recovery and you are not able to get to the gym. In general, depending on your current fitness level, it takes a while to lose appreciable muscle mass. You can read more about it in my response to How long does it take for my muscles to grow weaker if i skip the gym? 

I don’t know that you’ll find any studies that address your question. Your question delves more into exercise psychology and the “mind/body” link. In that respect, I think focus is often related to (confused with?) effort. Some may say that if you’re not focused during your training, you’re not providing enough effort to achieve your goals. In order for that to be true, one would need to quantify how “focus” affects training. You’re likely to find more anecdotal evidence than real studies. With that in mind, there’s an old saying attributed to Napoleon Hill: 

I don’t know of any scientific studies to prove out a specific range of sets or reps that induce hypertrophy. Although your background info stated a generally accepted consensus for training, we are all individuals, and, we all react to training stress differently. Changing the sets and reps is definitely a good idea, if for nothing else, to avoid a training plateau and stagnant progress. But, weight training is just one aspect for increasing muscle mass (hypertrophy). That’s why it’s so difficult for some, and, easy for others to gain mass. 

So, to answer your question, if you are a beginner on the rower, I would set the damper to the recommended low setting of 3-5. If after a while, you need a challenge, experiment with a higher setting. But, I would not recommend going too high with the setting as this typically leads to bad form and a potential for injury. 

Regardless of the exercises you mentioned, the targeting muscles are typically the hip flexors, rectus abdominus, and the external obliques. The position of your arms should have no effect on the work your abs receive in the exercises you mentioned if your goal is to train abs. However, the position you choose may dictate how long you can perform the movement. For example, most people that perform hanging leg raises tend to tire in the arms and/or shoulders before the abs. Hanging leg raises tend to be one of the tougher movements in terms of effort for the reason I gave. Performing the same movement on parallel bars would be akin to hanging in that, once again, the arms and/or shoulders tend to tire first. And, doing leg raises on a captain's chair would engage the arms and shoulders with even less effort. As for potential for injury, assuming you have no prior arm/shoulder injuries, any of the movements mentioned should be ok to perform. Deciding what exercise to use should be predicated on the movement of your legs/knees and your goals. You should aim to perform a complete range of motion without any swinging of the legs. Swinging of the legs will lessen the work the abdominals must perform as part of the exercise. As with any other body part, you should consider variety when choosing ab exercises. That would mean using all available equipment and movements to achieve your goals. 

No. What the trainer told you is one of the many common misconceptions surrounding the use of the ergometer. That adjustment, known as a damper, does not set the resistance for the machine. If you take a close look at the damper while you move it, you'll see that when you set it to a low number, the opening on the damper gets smaller. And, when you set it to a higher number, the opening increases. The damper actually controls the flow of air into the flywheel cage. The higher the number, the faster the flywheel will slow down after each stroke. That means it will take more work to spin the flywheel on the next stroke. The opposite is true for lower numbers.

The above is a small subset that should get you started. I would recommend you go back to your doctor and get his advice on the above exercises before trying them. I'd also suggest you suspend erg work (if you're doing it) until you feel no discomfort. The last thing you want to do is have a setback if you’re trying to get back into a boat. 

These types of questions inevitably generate lots of opinion based responses. And that's because there's really no right or wrong answer (from current research). The way each of us responds to training stimulus and our recovery ability is going to vary from individual to individual. Removing recovery days will tax the ability to recover for the next session. That's not to say it can't be done. It surely requires an understanding of the training response. The “Holy Grail” of fitness training and making gains is to determine and understand what it is that works for each of us. Individually. A frequent stumbling block to many exercisers is the dreaded “plateau”. Varying sets, reps, volume, rest days, etc. can be effective response since it forces your body to adapt to a newer training regimen. The type of adjustment is typically determined by your personal fitness goals. Additionally, on an individual basis, some muscles may respond differently to increased volume. For example, I may be able to handle an additional leg day while you may not. A valid approach would be to try less volume in favor of less rest days and see what gains, if any, occur. Keeping accurate sets/reps/weight records should provide the answer to your question. 

My first impression of viewing that video was how could you not get a sore neck from that movement? The movement shown appeared to put a lot of stress on the neck and trap muscles. Maybe you should try supporting your neck with your hands. 

I'm often amazed at the misinformation that's out there. If you're talking about definition in the sense of being able to see well defined muscle groups, then, that is a by-product of a proper diet and genetics. And, if it were true, why would you want to risk "undernourishment and dehydration"? 

I would hesitate comparing yourself to a professional bodybuilder unless you are planning to take anabolic steroids (which I don't recommend). I trained as a drug free bodybuilder for 20 years and was able to compete at a national level. I consider myself a mesomorph and had to work at adding competition mass. Keep in mind there's more to bodybuilding than just pure mass. 

It sounds like you're referring to doing reverse pull-ups to work the biceps. If so, purchasing a dumbbell set would provide you with more opportunity to expand your workouts. Additionally, exercise bands can work for you. If your budget is a concern, then, find a heavy can of food that you can grip with your hand. That's a free substitute for a dumbbell. 

You should definitely consider seeing your doctor as numbness is usually indicative of some other problem. As others have suggested, it may be as simple as changing your running shoes. Or, as even others have noted, lace-tying may be the cause. But, there’s another cause you may want to consider. Nerve compression. The compression may be caused externally (shoes, laces, etc.), or, structurally (scar tissue, impingement). It could be caused by your gait and how you land on your foot. It really depends on where you actually feel the numbness. Either way, numbness is something that should be addressed sooner than later, because if nerve impingement is the cause, you run the risk of permanent damage if the problem is not addressed. 

Pain in the back of the knee (‘popliteal’ region) does have some common causes. The most common being a popliteal cyst caused by the buildup of synovial fluid in the knee that migrates to the back of the knee. The underlying cause is usually related to arthritis, or, acute cartilage injury to the knee. 

Pain in the shoulder blade can be indicative of many types of problems ranging from a simple muscle strain to a torn rotator cuff. From your description, the pain is not yet problematic, so, I would continue to monitor it and avoid movements (eg. behind the neck press) that can exacerbate the problem. Try doing other movements for shoulders
