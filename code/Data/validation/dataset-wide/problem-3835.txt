Let $K$ be a finite field, and $\overline{K}$ its algebraic closure. It is well known that two curves are isomorphic over $\overline{K}$ if and only if they have the same $j$-invariant. If two such curves are also $K$-isogenous, I believe we can conclude that they are $K$-isomorphic, but I cannot find any reference or elementary proof of this fact; is it easy to see, or does anyone have a reference? (it seems that this result is implicitly used in the algorithms for isogeny graphs of elliptic curves, like Kohel's, where the isogenous curves are encoded by there $j$-invariant). As a side question, given a $j \in K$, how many curves over $K$ have this $j$-invariant, up to $K$-isomorphisms? For example, a (non-supersingular) curve and its quadratic twist both have the same $j$-invariant, but are not $K$-isogenous, so not $K$-isomorphic, so we have at least two $K$-isomorphism classes; is this it? 

This is not an answer. Scott, I am trying to understand the difference between the two. Could you please explain the reason for BB being OK? It seems to me that the usual argument for existence of the values for BB should be provable in a very weak set theory. We form the set of halting TM with n states, prove that it is finite, and take the maximum of steps before halting for each of them. The reason we can not compute the values is the logical complexity of the formula defining BB, we could compute it if it was $\Sigma_1$, but it is not. Am I correct? I guess that the distinction is about the complexity of the formula defining the function. It seems that you are OK with arbitrary quantifiers over natural numbers but not over sets of them. For example, what would you say if we use GC in place of CH? So you are asking about arithmetical functions. What about BB for Turing machines with oracles in the arithmetical hierarchy? Is using higher order quantifiers over natural numbers OK? What if I define it to be the BB for functions defined by such formulas? I think the relation with truth predicate is that since you are OK with arithmetical formulas, you think they have definite truth values, but it seems that you don't think that formulas outside this hierarchy, e.g. those with set quantifiers over natural number necessary have definite truth values. 

In Cox's book "Primes of the form $x^2 + ny^2$", he proves that in a quadratic imaginary field $K$, if $\mathcal O$ is an order of conductor $f \in \mathbb Z$, we have that the class group $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O)$ of $\mathcal O$ is isomorphic to the quotient $I_K(f) / P_{K,\mathbb Z}(f)$, where $I_K(f)$ is the free abelian group generated by the prime ideals of $\mathcal O_K$ coprime to $f\mathcal O_K$, and $P_{K,\mathbb Z}(f)$ is the subgroup of principal ideals $\alpha \mathcal O_K$ where $\alpha$ is congruent mod $f\mathcal O_K$ to an integer coprime to $f$ (proposition 7.22). So $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O)$ is a quotient of the ray class group relative to $f\mathcal O_K$. I suspect a more general result, but I cannot find any reference. Let $K$ be a number field, and $\mathcal O$ an order of conductor $\mathfrak f \subset \mathcal O_K$, 

It is an open problem if there is an optimal propositional proof system. Therefore we don't know if ZFC as a propositional proof system is optimal either. ZFC as propositional proof system can p-simulate any propositional proof system whose soundness (if there is proof for a formula then the formula is true) as a propositional proof system is provable in ZFC. The trick (which I think is due to Steve Cook) is based on the fact that proofs are concrete finite objects, if there is a proof for a formula in a proof system, then ZFC can prove its existence (i.e. ZFC is $\Sigma_1$-complete), combining this with the provability of the soundness we derive the truth of the encoded formula in ZFC. The rest of the argument is translating this first order proof in ZFC to a propositional proof in ZFC as propositional proof system and proving the equivalence of a propositional formula with the formula itself in the proof system. This can be done in $\mathsf{TC^0}$-Frege and any system that contains it. See Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity, 2010 by Cook and Nguyen for the details. 

I'm looking for an explicit bound for $f(x) = \sum_{N\mathfrak p \leq x}\chi(\mathfrak p)\ln(N\mathfrak p)$, where $\chi$ is a Hecke character for a number field $K$ of degree $n$, on the ideals $I_\mathfrak m$, trivial on $P_\mathfrak m^+$, the sum is over prime ideals $\mathfrak p$ of bounded norm. All I could find is $$\sum_{N\mathfrak p \leq x}\chi(\mathfrak p)\ln(N\mathfrak p) = O(nx^{1/2}\ln(x)\ln(xd_KN\mathfrak m)),$$ for non-principal characters, and $$\sum_{N\mathfrak p \leq x}\chi(\mathfrak p)\ln(N\mathfrak p) = x + O(nx^{1/2}\ln(x)\ln(xd_KN\mathfrak m)),$$ for the principal character, assuming GRH, from Henryk Iwaniec and Emmanuel Kowalski, Analytic number theory, p. 114. I would need to know more about the implied constant factor. Conditional bounds (GRH, ERH) are welcome. I actually plan to use such a result to derive a bound on $\sum_{N\mathfrak p \leq x}\chi(\mathfrak p)$, so any explicit bound on the later sum is also welcome. 

To have a set $A\subseteq \{2\Uparrow n \mid n\in \mathbb N \}$ s.t. $A\in \mathsf{NP} -\mathsf{P}$, it suffices to have a set $A' \in \mathsf{NTime}(2\Uparrow n) - \mathsf{DTime}(2\Uparrow n)$ and let $A = \{ 2\Uparrow k \mid k \in A'\}$, which is consistent with current state of knowledge (AFAIK). So conjecture 1 cannot be ruled out unless this possibility is ruled out. Assuming that $\mathsf{P} \neq \mathsf{NP}$, the statement is true if $A$ is not just polynomial time decidable but also polynomial time enumerable. (Take a set in $\mathsf{NP}-\mathsf{P}$ and consider its image under the enumeration inside $A$. The image is in $\mathsf{NP}-\mathsf{P}$ and is a subset of $A$ as required.) Note that any r.e. set is in fact polynomial time enumerable (the enumeration doesn't need to be injective). Therefore if $\mathsf{NP}\neq \mathsf{P}$ then conjecture 2 will be true and cannot be ruled out. 

The problem actually boils down to proving that the map $$\varphi : I_K(\mathfrak f) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O) : \mathfrak a \longmapsto \mathfrak [\mathfrak a \cap \mathcal O]$$ is a surjection. Indeed, if it is the case, then $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O) \cong I_K(\mathfrak f) / \ker(\varphi)$, but it is easy to see that $P_K(\mathfrak f) \subset \ker(\varphi)$ (where $P_K(\mathfrak f)$ is from the definition of the ray class group, i.e. $\mathrm{Cl}_\mathfrak f(K) \cong I_K(\mathfrak f) / P_K(\mathfrak f)$), so $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O)$ would be a quotient of $\mathrm{Cl}_\mathfrak f(K)$. 

I am having a look at the paper Explicit CM-theory for level 2-structures on abelian surfaces by Br√∂ker, Gruenewald and Lauter, and there is an argument which I don't understand. The main reason being that the argument is not explicitly written down, but justified by the wild card "it is not hard to check". Here is the situation (lemma 6.5 in the paper). We are given a cyclic, CM-field $K$ of degree 4 (i.e., a cyclic extension $K/\mathbb Q$ of degree 4, such that $K$ is a totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real quadratic number field $K_0$). Let $\sigma$ be a generator of $\mathrm{Gal}(K/\mathbb Q)$, and define the map $$m : \mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O_K) \longrightarrow \mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O_K) : [\mathfrak p] \longmapsto [\mathfrak p \mathfrak p^\sigma],$$ for degree 1 prime ideals $\mathfrak p$ (any ideal class can be represented by such a $[\mathfrak p]$). They claim that the image of $m$ contains all the squares of $\mathrm{Cl}(\mathcal O_K)$. This is described as "not hard to check", but I have to admit that I cannot find any simple argument. 

This is not an answer to the question intended by OP, but rather a philosophical meta-answer and might be interesting to some readers. The use of sign $\vdash$ is completely different from $\rightarrow$. You can not prove "$\varphi \vdash \psi$", since it is not a proposition. It is a speech-act, it is invented by Frege and has been discussed extensively in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of language. This speech-act is called assertion and is composed of two separate parts "|" and "-". It is an act of judgment. For more details see this SEP article. This distinction between a proposition and a judgment is very important and essential for Martin-Lof's type theory and philosophy. In fact, from this viewpoint, $\varphi \vdash \psi$ is a common formal misuse because the assumptions cannot be before the speech-act. For this reason Martin-Lof prefers to write the assumptions of the assertion after the proposition in his type theories. For difference between $\vdash$ and $\rightarrow$ see this article. 

The Schoof-Elkies-Atkin (SEA) algorithm (for counting points on elliptic curves over a finite field) performs computations over polynomials modulo some modular polynomials. Originally the "classical" modular polynomials (the minimum polynomial of the modular function $\tau \mapsto j(\ell \tau)$ for a given prime $\ell$). It turns out that the coefficients of this polynomial increase very fast with the prime $\ell$, so in practice other polynomials should be used. In the Handbook of Elliptic and Hyperelliptic Curve Cryptography (Cohen and Frey), they present the "canonical" modular polynomials, and apparently people also use the Weber modular polynomials (Genus 1 point counting records over prime fields), which have even smaller coefficients, but I cannot find any reference on how to use them. And people also talk about other polynomials (Atkin polynomials ?). In all the descriptions of SEA I could find, they just use the classical version and add a side note "in practice we would use other polynomials". So here is the question: is there any literature dealing with those alternatives of the classical modular polynomials? (comparing them, which one is the best in the context of SEA, and how to use them even though they don't give as much information as the classical one). Which ones are used in the state-of-the-art implementations of SEA and why? (e.g. in Magma). 

The intuition I have is that relations definable by polynomials is complicated enough that projections can give rise to very complicated sets. The essential point here is not exponential growth, that comes from the unboundedness of the quantifiers, the essential point is that the graph of a very fast growing function can be represented by a polynomial. On the other hand, if the question is about how polynomial equations can represent graphs of complicated function, then I guess the best explanation is by the people who came up with the idea of how to use these equations to represent the graph of a fast growing function, which can find in My Collaboration with JULIA ROBINSON by Yuri MATIYASEVICH (skip to the line numbered (6) in the text) or in his book. 

The reflection is similar to the property above with truth replaced with provability: let $\square$ denote the provability in theory $T'$. Then reflection property is: 

I am interested in the following situation: given a braid $B$, it induces a link $L$ in a pretty straightforward way ("glue" the endpoints, like here). For a braid $B$, we know how to represent it in a normal form, which provides in particular a complete invariant of the braid (two braids have the same normal form if and only if they are equivalent). The computation of a normal form can be done efficiently. But once the link is formed... what can be done? I don't think we know any computable normal form for links... But do we know any good invariant? By "good invariant" I mean: 0) If two links are equivalent, their invariant is the same (definition of an invariant, nothing new here), 1) It can be computed in polynomial time, 2) If two links are not equivalent, they have same invariant with negligible probability (for some notion of "negligible probability"...)
