I would consider this question from a mathematical stand point, angling in from two directions on your scenario. First, the average adult "test taker" has a vocabulary of 20,000 - 35,000 words [1] Second, mathematics, takes basic concepts and composes them into more complex mathematical objects - all of which are represented by symbols rather than words - which in a sense could be thought of as vocabulary words, but with their own semantics and context, i.e. mathematics is it's own language. In mathematics we have short and elegant equations, no longer ( and often times much shorter ) than an English sentence, which taken as a whole, can describe several highly intricate steps of computation taken on perhaps millions of pieces of information. This is especially true in machine learning contexts. Language works in a similar way; by selecting words, assigning definitions or meanings to those words, defining valid variations which systematically alter the meanings of the words (e.g. past tense, plurality, etc.) So if your language users have a larger vocabulary, and perhaps a broader range of alterations that can be applied to the words of their language, with rules that determine their use, then it is conceivably possible for very large amounts of information to be transferred in very short utterances. Taking into account other ways of multiplexing increasing signal bandwidth in terms of language, such as intonation and a larger alphabet, then the size of words can be shortened without changing their meaning. So the encoding aspect of the language hinges on the availability of variations in sound which represent bits or small chunks of data - letter grouping combinations and their associated phonemes. An important aspect of encoding is being able to distinguish between phonemes. This is done with statistical analysis in natural language processing by including the surrounding words in a phrase in order to raise the probability that the sound "see" is referring to the concept "to see", "the sea" or "the letter C". But again, by formulating a larger vocabulary it is possible to simply replace the sounds associated with each concept so there is less ambiguity. As well, by increasing the bandwidth of the signal, by adding intonation, having a larger alphabet and making sure that each letter in the alphabet has a distinct phoneme that can easily be distinguished from the others, makes processing the language less intensive by reducing or eliminating ambiguity. The high level concepts again rely on the vocabulary size. Similar to the way equations represent high level mathematical concepts in the way an equation brings multiple concepts together by grouping with parenthesis, stringing symbols together with operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, and feeding concepts into other concepts by functional composition, a high-level, spoken language, using commas, fragments, and recondite terms, can pull together complex information into a short description. What this means for a spoken language that is designed to be fast and compact is that it should take up the full range of the audible spectrum, which depends on the qualities of the ear of the species. To an un-trained listener, the sound of spoken communications would sound very noisy, like white noise, somewhat like the loud sound that you get on an old TV set when the screen is displaying static from no signal. But perhaps with some hints of clicks, whistles and other sonic patterns that would be trackable by the human listener as something complementing, or perhaps segmenting the over-all noise. Think of the sound you get when you listen to a fax machine over the phone. 

In reality, we don't automate weapon systems to the point where we have autonomous soldiers, because there are ethics issues: How should the machine decide who it should kill, and who not? Generally, people feel that people should stay in control of such things. Ethics is a valid reason for technology ban. 

Don't confuse the goods with currency. Goods are the things the people want to trade. The currency is only the mediator. It doesn't have to be a valuable thing. In fact, it shouldn't be a valuable thing, especially in intergalactic trade. Why that? Consider our situation now. For some time, there was the gold standard, which was the promise by the US bank system to trade in gold for money. This keeps currencies rather stable, i'd say. However, there is a problem: Once the money that's around surpasses the available gold, you can't hold to the promise. That's why we the gold standard was dropped (as far as I understand, and without the historical context). So, the value of the generated goods far outpass the gold value available to back up the money. If we kept to the gold standard, there would be shortage of money. You can't trade, although you have valuable stuff to sell and want to buy other valuable stuff. This problem becomes even bigger the more you scale your system up. What do you think how much value is produced in an intergalactic society? I can't imagine, but it is certainly too much to make one specific valuable thing the currency. Not even the spice is THAT valuable. 

Fire, for example is suggested by @Muz. A bucket of tar would work, but it would have to be carried on a chain to keep from burning the soldier carrying it. Otherwise lighting any such a projectile in the air would not be practical as I assume that nobody would have a Bic lighter or would want to fumble with flint or hot coals and tinder while being shot at with arrows and rain and wind would render on site ignition impossible. Reconnaissance was suggested by @BowlTurner. That might be a good strategy, but I think it would be better applied at night when flyers could not be seen overhead, but could track the retreating force and come back with details of their camp whence the opposing force could send a covert unit into the night, avoiding lookouts and try to assassinate the leadership of the enemy camp. Otherwise if one of the flying soldiers is in a good position to directly assassinate the opponents command then he perhaps could be sacrificed for that purpose, if that turns out to be the case. This is assuming that victory is more about killing effectively than anything chivalrous. @Will makes a good point about giving the opponents something to fear. Assuming that the first battle was a stalemate and the opponent already knows about the flying warriors, any surprises are basically out. The advantage in that sense is already lost... but if it weren't I would reserve the flying capability for the ground battle. Wait until the troops on both sides move in to clash. Have a number of soldiers who are capable of flying spread out over the entire force and instruct them to embellish their own abilities with the added edge of flight, but not to fly at length. Following from #3 above, @BM asks an important question. Assuming the wizard can cast the spell from a distance, have the wizard pick soldiers at random and cast the spell on them. Inform all the troops of what will happen on the battle field and what they are to do ( same as above ) if they are spelled. Rather it would be more stunning and frightening to an opponent if the solders were to shout down their opponents while making great leaps and coming down on the enemy with axes chopping, spears thrusting them into the ground, swords used at the moment the realization sets in that the one attacking just did something supernatural. If a few of the solders at the head of the charge where to leap off of their feet and charge forward in flight, and as opposed to running the last 100 feet, that would be most unexpected and shocking. But more importantly it would not go unnoticed by the entire front line. Meet the opponent with fury, but do not boast with overhead flight, making yourself a target, so to speak. As long as the fear tactics are successful, then when the enemy looks like they don't want to fight, before they run away, proceed to hack as many of them to pieces as you can. The ones that do get away will likely not come back. It might make sense to have the ones who do fly forward at the charge to simply carry shields and knock down as many of the enemy as possible, plow through the enemy line and make holes for others to enter. Then get up and start hacking, hopefully those behind who rush the holes will be there momentarily to help. The ones just behind the enemy line will not expect a single soldier to plow through like that, he can take advantage of that surprise, but if gets swamped he can always leap dozens of feet back to the support of his own troops. Of course the strategy will evolve in the moment and must rely to some degree on the autonomy of the soldiers because it is new and has not been tested nor has anyone been trained to implement it before. Several other answers are generally in agreement about general reconnaissance. @Erik makes a good point about giving the commanding officer the ability to fly so he can have more direct information about the unfolding battle, but he also mentions signalling. In the case of daytime, in-battle flight, for the purpose of signalling, and in combination with @Wingman4l7's calculation of 3.3 miles distance as the implied "safe distance" for the enemy's command, it would be necessary to have a signaling mechanism that would be practical from such a distance - this of course is assuming that there are no spy glasses/binoculars available. I would suggest small pouches of brightly dyed chalk or powder that would disperse in the air and create a large signalling plume so that information could be transmitted on site and the signal could thus serve as a location marker to reduce ambiguity in any relayed descriptions, however the person giving the signal would have to know what he was looking for and what the appropriate signal should be. However, the best application of such a signal would be merely as a decoy, to make the enemy command believe that their position had been compromised. But rather than simply receiving such a signal then pursuing the command as they retreat, it would be more effective to have stealth units flanking the area, positioning them via more cautious flight-based scouting and reporting. Keep in mind that flying high is visible, but low and fast is pretty standard when stealth is required, and 20mp is much faster than walking or running, about equivalent to galloping on horseback, but quieter. 

Suddenly computer networks and computers in general can be made a lot faster (or at least networks can have less latency). 

Since it seems that these grasstatos are EVERYWHERE, this means that food is incredibly cheap - even more so if harvesting can be brought to industrial scale. This means the kingdom will export cheap grasstato products, especially food. This will lead other countries to focus on other goods, maybe even becoming dependant on grasstatos themselves, or even suffering economic collapse. An easy remedy is charging customs for import from the grasstato kingdom, which means trade with other kingdoms is expensive and limited. 

evasion is hard because missiles are way faster than ships (or there are laser weapons), so guiding/aiming is actually easy reaction time of a simple AI is quicker than of a complicated one. A simple control circuit may do the job better than a complete brain simulation if evasion is possible, then it may be simple: a little random, unpredictable jitter, and the missile doesn't hit. 

Check out the purported alien autopsy video filmed in 1947. Hoax or not, this is probably the source for most artistic representations of aliens since that time. $URL$ 

Other possibilities include steep embankment after a rain. So slick, muddy slide to a stop. Water is a no go. The human body hitting water at 120mph is roughly equivalent to hitting concrete. However I remember a report of a suicide jumper hitting the water feet first like a pencil dive and surviving. From what I remember hearing, the jumper's shoes basically exploded off his feet. I do not believe this is the same account, but is one of them. The article states the impact velocity was about 75mph, so little more than half of terminal velocity. 

source However, the post eruption scenario is quite different. I would speculate that something like this would be worse than the Great Depression. My guess is that large scale conflict like what we saw in the two world wars WWII would be less likely since the world would be so devasted, trade, and as a result production, would be so depressed that coordination on the scale of a world war would simply be impossible and for the remaining powers to sit at home, bicker at a distance and lob inter continental missles at each other would be pointless. However there may likely be a global devolvement into internal conflicts and power struggles for the better part of a century. Global economics would have to recover considerably before any kind of global conflict or outright war would help anyone to accomplish their goals. So to answer the question of the global balance of power. The global economy would probably quickly collapse and render most governments largely ineffectual. Much of the world would devolve into something along the lines of tribal or clan based government and most conflicts for some time would be small and over local resources and control of local groups or clans. 

But this is fiction, you could just say: We found these things, they don't allow for time travel, so all this Relativity stuff wasn't 100% right after all. What's the problem with that? 

Electronics are very available already, and will be even more available in future. I just got rid of two old laptops and one desktop PC, which were all still functioning. In my little 2-person family we are still left with 3 laptops, 1 desktop, a smartphone, a "non-smart" cell phone, and an additional cell phone that still works, but is not used. Oh, and two game consoles and a gameboy. All this builds up over time, we are not exactly prone to regularly buy such things. This is very different from my childhood. While I had a gameboy and a PC by the time I turned ten, electronics was still rather sparse at my family. I think I didn't have a cell phone at all until I was something like 15. My nephew is 2 now, and just starts speaking. However, he has been playing with phones basically since he was able to hold one. That means playing to talk to someone on the phone. He wants to watch lullabies and cars on Youtube (Yes his parents show him lullabies from Youtube, you read right. He wants it, and it works in putting him to sleep). He knows how to operate a tablet, and plays simple puzzle games (put the car into the right hole) on it. He likes to play with remote controls of the tv. While things like Lego and chalk don't grow old, I would expect the shear amount of old smart phones, tablets and other electronics by the time our great-grandchildren live means that kids will have a personal electronic device as soon as they can make use of one. You will, like today, have children that play more with such things, and others who are more interested in other things. But electronics will be widely available, powerful, and it will be used. And sometimes kids will just hold the phone to their ear and pretend to talk with Batman. 

source And the politics are complicated. Up until the decision to enter. Roosevelt's public position was one of non-entry: 

The significant difference between a shock or vibration and a pressure differential, in this case, is that vibranium will absorb the shock. Nothing is said about the effect of the pressure differential. Presumably this means that there is nothing interesting to note about it. In other words the effect of a pressure differential on vibranium is static, the same as it is on other naturally occuring elements - meaning a standard weapon should work as expected and the projectile will be ejected, even if it is made of vibranium. However, one benefit (potentially also a caveat) of the bullet being made of vibranium is that the shot will likely be silent - without a silencing device: 

A Celestial body can have a complex rotation, in other words Earth rotates on its axis but there's a phenomenon called the precession of the equinoxes. The direction that the North Pole points actually rotates over time but very slowly. I'm not a physicist but my guess is that in order for this to work on something like a yearly scale with one pole always pointing toward the solar body firstly the procession would have to exactly match the length of the year which is almost completely unlikely unless it was engineered somehow and the mass of the planet would need to be much different then a normal planet. Perhaps it would work with something like a black hole which spins very quickly and Could Have A procession short enough to be equal to the length of its year. Note that Earth's precessional cycle take several thousand years. 

Disclaimer: I'm not a physicist. That begin said: Short Version: From what I understand from the various expeditions in the world of Physics.SE FTL-questions, I'd say any kind of FTL travel or communication will allow causality violation. Longer version: There are a few potential problems I see with your description: First of all, how can points belonging to the same network share the same inertial reference frame, and still move relative to their respective stars? Check with your trusted physicist, but as far as I understand, inertial reference frame means no relative motion between each other. Also, I don't know what being in the same inertial reference frame, but far apart, would do, and if it matches your expectations of having a well-defined "now"/"simultaneous"/"instantaneous". Typically, violating causality goes like this(crude explanation, look at the many answers on Physics.SE for a better one): Move from point A to point B at superluminar speed. Now move back. You end up in a reference frame at position A but before you left. Remember that "simultaneous" is something very unintuitive in Relativity (not sure whether that's General or Special Relativity), and depends on the observer (=is relative). 

Even though this is tagged "magic", I'm just going to assume "extra-sensory" is not magic for this purpose because I do not really see a need for it is this case. As far as I can see magic only really complicates things and makes more to explain into/out of in this case. I can expand on that in answer to a different question if you like. :) Assuming that there is the possibility of telepathic ability, then you must have another telepathic/other-sensory person first sense, locate and track the behaviors and thought processes of the "suspect". The closest example I know of for a scenario like this is in the movie Suspect Zero. In that case an ex-government-research-projects subject was involved in military "psy-ops" (psychic operations, presumably for remote spying) to produce and control states of mind in which the subject could project into space and view events/scenes from other locations. As far as I recall this did not involve directly sensing the mind or thoughts of other individuals, i.e. the suspect, but rather identifying and following a pattern (or lack thereof) based on various disappearances. Basically, using astral projection to review/search/cover an area in a region central to the disappearances, searching possible routes and eventually, meticulously tracking possibilities back to some kind of hot spot/region before discovering the location and evidence of the activities of the suspect, referred to as in the title as suspect zero due to the overall lack of a pattern for the crimes. Here you have a similar concept, but a rather different situation. However, this would seem to involve more drama, revelation of inner agony, torment and certainly as much thrill as you want. Why do the people then want to die? What does the suspect "do" to them? Focus on that, it will take plenty of explaining to get that to work well. And not only do you have to deal with a single event/victim at a time (meaning active threats, things to consider, deaths), you have, at first, a string of suicides and evidence, then as you get closer, a collection, perhaps only a small collection, of terribly disturbed people who are being protected from themselves. Identify who the suspect likes to target and filter the mental spaces to focus on those people first. Get into their heads and help to draw them away from the suspect. Close his mental doors and put pressure on him. Find a team of ex-government hires who do psy-ops or similar and a monk or some other odd figures and have them work together to corner the suspect. When he has no way out of the body, then you can have foot soldiers chase him down when all of his mental exits are blocked. 

If Eragon taught us one thing about magic, it is that killing by magic is laughably easy. No fireballs, no big effects. Just a rupture of a blood vessel in the brain, or cutting a few nerves -> instant death. Combine this with the magic power that is normally portrayed by the big spellcasters in such scenarios, and you get a dead army, and your mage hasn't even broken a sweat. If you don't like this answer because the area of effect of such magic is too big (although the required energy is kinda low), then some kind of magic-induced disease that is highly contageous, deadly, and takes a few days for incubation would at least seriously diminuish the army. Take out the rest while they bury their fellow soldiers. 

Peoples skills are already not the most important part of a modern weapon system. Humans, for ethical reasons, still are in control and decide when and who to shoot, but where are human skills in guided missiles / other guided weapons? Mind you, those are likely also the ones that will be used in space combat. You probably don't even need very complicated AI for a reasonably good weapons system. However, what about maneuvering? AIs would be really good at predicting the opponents moves, thus there would be an arms race between guiding AIs and evasion AIs (supposing that evasion is actually possible, which is not so clear, even less with energy weapons / laser). Maybe humans are less predictable? (Note that I wouldn't bet on this IRL...)
