Over a noetherian ring: 1) the answer is no in general, even for local artinian rings: Let $R$ be the ring given as a $K$-linear space with basis $(1,t_1,t_2)$ and $t_1t_2=0$, it is local artinian if $K$ is a field. Let $M$ be the free $K$-module with basis $(e_1,e_2,f)$; make it an $R$-module by setting $t_ie_i=f$, $t_ie_j=0$ for $i\neq j$, $t_if=0$. It is faithful because if $\alpha+\alpha_1t_1+\alpha_2t_2$ is in the annihilator, evaluation on $f$ yields $\alpha=0$, then on $e_i$ yields $\alpha_i=0$. But every element has a nontrivial annihilator: an element $a_1e_1+a_2e_2+bf$ is killed by $a_2t_1-a_1t_2$ which is nonzero if $(a_1,a_2)\neq (0,0)$, and $bf$ is killed by $t_1$. There are many more examples using large abelian subspaces of nilpotent matrices, for instance, using matrices in the upper right block (say over a field) of $2n\times 2n$-matrices, we obtain a $K$-algebra of dimension $n^2+1$ and a faithful $2n$-dimensional module (with dimension in the sense of linear algebra), hence it's to small to contain free submodules of rank 1 as soon as $n\ge 2$. 2)(edit!) the answer is yes if $R$ is an arbitrary domain. Indeed, let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-module such that each element has a nonzero annihilator. Using generators, we can write $M$ as a quotient of $\bigoplus_{j=1}^d R/I_j$ for some nonzero ideals $I_j$ (the annihilators of the $d$ generators). Since $R$ is a domain, $I=I_1\dots I_d\neq 0$; since $I$ annihilates $M$ we deduce that $M$ has a nonzero annihilator. 

Here are two examples. I describe it as Lie algebras (over any field $K$). (1) The 7-dimensional, 3-step nilpotent Lie algebra with basis $(X_1,\dots,X_7)$ and nonzero brackets $$ [X_1,X_2]=X_4,[X_1,X_3]=X_5,[X_2,X_3]=X_6,[X_1,X_4]=[X_1,X_5]=[X_2,X_4]=[X_3,X_6]=X_7$$ (2) The 6-dimensional, 4-step nilpotent Lie algebra with basis $(X_1,\dots,X_6)$ and nonzero brackets $$[X_1,X_2]=X_3, [X_1,X_3]=X_4, [X_2,X_3]=X_5, [X_1,X_5]=[X_2,X_4]=X_6.$$ Here's a common proof. In (1), let $V$ be the subspace generated by $X_1,X_2,X_3$, $W$ the subspace generated by $X_4,X_5,X_6$, and $Z$ the subspace generated by $X_7$. In (2), let $V$ be the subspace generated by $X_1,X_2$, $W$ the subspace generated by $X_4,X_5$, and $Z$ the subspace generated by $X_6$. Then in each $\mathfrak{g}$ of these two: $Z$ is the 1-dimensional center, and the bracket $V\times W\to Z$ defines a non-degenerate pairing. Thus for each hyperplane $X$ in $V$, its centralizer in $W$ is equal to its orthogonal $X^\bot$ with respect to this pairing. Each codimension 1 ideal of $\mathfrak{g}$ has the form $I_X=X\oplus \mathfrak{g}$ where $X$ is some hyperplane, and the center of $I_X$ is equal to the 2-dimensional ideal $X^\bot\oplus Z$. Both Lie algebra being defined over $\mathbf{Q}$, we can consider the corresponding lattice, which therefore answers your question. 

No, there's no uniform (=cocompact) lattice in $\mathbf{R}^n\rtimes\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{R})$ for any $n\ge 2$. Up to the action by automorphisms of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})$, all lattices are contained in $\mathbf{R}^n\rtimes\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$, which is not cocompact. Indeed, let $\Gamma$ be a lattice. In a connected Lie group, the intersection of a lattice with the amenable radical is a lattice in the amenable radical. So $\Gamma\cap\mathbf{R}^n$ is a lattice in $\mathbf{R}^n$; hence modulo a global automorphism induced by some element of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{R})$, we can assume that $\Gamma\cap\mathbf{R}^n=\mathbf{Z}^n$. The subgroup $\Gamma$ is then contained in the normalizer of $\Gamma\cap\mathbf{R}^n=\mathbf{Z}^n$, and this normalizer is equal to $\mathbf{R}^n\rtimes\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$. 

Suppose we have a counterexample. Passing to either a smaller invariant subspace or to a quotient allows to assume that the action of $A$ on $\mathbf{Q}^m$ is irreducible. Then $V_-\cap\mathbf{Q}^m$ is clearly a invariant subspace and is nonzero. So it is all of $\mathbf{Q}^m$. Hence $A$ has all its eigenvalues of modulus $\le 1$. Since the product of its eigenvalues, given by the determinant, is $\pm 1$, all its eigenvalues have modulus 1 (and are not roots of unity). This cannot hold, by standard "geometry of numbers" argument Ã  la Minkowski. 

Start from a group $G$ and embed it into a perfect group $P$ (e.g., a symmetric group). Consider the group $H$ obtained by amalgamating countably many copies $P_n$ of $P$ over $G$. Then $H$ is perfect. Let $H_n$ be the subgroup generated by $\bigcup_{k\ge n}P_k$; it is isomorphic to $H$ and also perfect. The decreasing intersection of the $H_n$ is reduced to $G$. Hence $G$ is an filtering projective limit of perfect groups. (This can sound a bit surprising, since one mostly works with projective limits of surjections, in which case many groups cannot be obtained.) 

To your edited question, here is an example, which is an extension of $\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$ by the lamplighter $(\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z})^2\wr\mathbf{Z}$. Fix a prime $p$ congruent to -1 modulo 4 (so that -1 has no square root mod $p$). Consider a group $H_p$ made up of formal sums $\sum a_ne_n\oplus\sum b_nf_n\oplus c$, where $a_n,b_n,c\in\mathbf{F}_p$ (all but finitely being 0), and $e_n,f_n$ is a fixed "basis". Define the "Heisenberg-like product" $(\sum a_ne_n\oplus\sum b_nf_n\oplus c)(\sum a'_ne_n\oplus\sum b'_nf_n\oplus c')=\sum a''_ne_n\oplus\sum b''_nf_n\oplus c''$, where $a''_n=a_n+a'_n$, $b''_n=b_n+b'_n$, $c''=c+c'+\sum a_nb'_n-a'_nb_n$. This is a group (it is the quotient of an infinite direct sum of copies of the Heisenberg by a central subgroup, at least if $p\neq 2$). We denote by $z$ the element $0\oplus 0\oplus 1$ of $H_p$. There is an obvious automorphism $\alpha$ of $H_p$ shifting the indices, namely mapping $e_n\mapsto e_{n+1}$, $f_n\mapsto f_{n+1}$, $z\mapsto z$. Let us also consider the involution $s: e_n\mapsto f_n\mapsto e_n$, $z\mapsto -z$, which commutes with $\alpha$. Consider the semidirect product $G_p=H_p\rtimes(\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}/2)$, where $\mathbf{Z}\times\mathbf{Z}/2$ is identified to $\langle\alpha,s\rangle$. Then $G$ is 3-step solvable, and finitely generated (by 3 generators, say $\alpha$, $s$, and $e_0$). I claim that $G_p$ has no infinite abelian normal subgroup, and more precisely that every abelian normal subgroup $N$ of $G_p$ is contained in the normal cyclic subgroup $\langle z\rangle$ of order $p$. Otherwise, the projection $N'$ of $N$ on $G_p$ is a nontrivial abelian normal subgroup. Since $H'_p=H_p/Z$ is its own centralizer in $G'_p=G_p/Z$, we have $N'\cap H'_p$ nontrivial. So we can suppose that $N\subset H_p$. Thus $N'$ is an $\langle\alpha,s\rangle$-invariant subgroup of $H'_p$, i.e. a $\mathbf{F}_{p^2}[\alpha^{\pm 1}]$-submodule of $H'_p$. Here we defined this module structure by letting a given square root of -1 (which is in $\mathbf{F}_{p^2}\smallsetminus\mathbf{F}_{p}$) act as $s$. Since $N'$ is nonzero, it contains some element of the form $w=\lambda_0e_0+\lambda_1e_1+\dots \lambda_ke_k$, where $k\ge 0$, $\lambda_i\in\mathbf{F}_{p^2}$, and $\lambda_0\lambda_k\neq 0$. So it also contains the element $w'=\lambda_0e_{-k}+\dots \lambda_ke_0$. But any two lifts in $N$ of $w$ and $w'$ do not commute and we get a contradiction. 

The subgroup of $n$-root of unity in $K^*$ has a direct summand in $K^*$. $x\mapsto x^n$ is surjective on $K$ 

An extended comment: this is not true for actions on more general locally compact (Hausdorff metrizable) spaces. For instance, let $\Gamma$ be any countable group admitting infinitely many distinct subgroups of prime order $H_n$; write $H_\infty=\{1\}$. Denote $F=\{x_m:m\le\infty\}$ (the 1-point compactification of a countable discrete set). Let $X$ be the set of pairs $(f,y)$ with $f=x_m\in F$ and $y\in \Gamma/H_m$. It is naturally a $\Gamma$-set, where $g(f,y)=(f,gy)$. Make it a topological space so that $(x_m,y)$ is isolated for $m<\infty$ and a basis of neighborhoods for $(x_\infty,g)$ with $g\in \Gamma$ is given by $(V_n(g))$, where $V_n=\{(x_m,g'H_m):m\ge n, g\in g'H_m\}$. This makes the action of $\Gamma$ continuous. It is easily seen to be compact, it's slightly more subtle that it is Hausdorff: this uses the fact that for every $g\neq 1$ in $\Gamma$, there exists $n_0$ such that $g\notin H_n$ for $n\ge n_0$. The quotient of $X$ by the $\Gamma$-action can naturally be identified to $F$ and hence is Hausdorff compact. Clearly the stabilizers are finite. But the action is not proper: write $y_n=H_n$ consider the compact (open) subset $K$ consisting of those $(x_n,y_n)$, $n\le\infty$. Then if $s_n$ is a nontrivial element in $H_n$, $s_n$ fixes $(x_n,y_n)$, and in particular $s_nK\cap K$ is not empty, and hence the action is not compact. At this time I'm not sure how to change this into a manifold example but I'm skeptical about the claimed result. We can start from a connected Lie group $G$, consider $G\times\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$ with the left and right $G$-actions on each leaf, mod out the leaf $G\times\{t\}$ by the action on the right of some finite subgroup $F_t$ depending smoothly on $t$ for $t\neq 0$ and tending to the trivial subgroup $F_0=\{1\}$ when $t\to 0$ (in the sense that for every compact subset $K$ of $G$ there exists $\epsilon$ such that $|t|\le\epsilon$ implies $F_t\cap K=\{1\}$; we can find such guys in $\mathbf{SL}_2(\mathbf{R})$). The issue is to arrange the resulting space (on which $G$ still acts on the left, with finite stabilizers and quotient space $\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$ to be non-singular on the slice $G\times\{0\}$ (possibly $\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$ could be replaced with another closed manifold if it helps). The next issue is to find a discrete subgroup of $G$ whose action on the resulting space remains non-proper and with Hausdorff compact quotient...
