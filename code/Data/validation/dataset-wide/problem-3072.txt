If we want to make a military summary, it is fair to say that throughout the Cold War, USSR could muster more troops than USA/NATO, but Americans had better equipment. When considering planes, for instance, the MiG-25 was much faster in raw top speed than the contemporary F-14, and both USA and USSR were sure to point that out; but the F-14 was superior in actual fighting (much more agile, much better visibility...). (As an exception, USSR almost always kept the lead for the number of nuclear warheads, and they had the biggest of them all.) 

Apparently, gunpowder and firecrackers were described in 1267 by Roger Bacon (Marco Polo was 13 at that time, and had not yet departed to, let alone returned from, China). Firecrackers and fireworks are not exactly the same thing, although they are both used for festive and ritual reasons. Fireworks properly said (i.e. the ones which go up and are meant visual rather than auditive usages) were common in Song's China, especially during imperial celebrations. Since the Mongols (Yuan) adopted the pomp of the Chinese court, it is highly probable that Marco Polo, during his 18 years presence at Khubilai's court (1274 to 1292), saw quite a lot of it. It is hard to prove a negative, but chances are that Marco Polo bringing back gunpowder or any derivative (e.g. fireworks) to Europe is a myth. As all popular myths, it also includes variants; e.g. that page depicts Marco Polo bringing gunpowder to the Chinese, not the other way round. 

Thus, Baldwin IV could become King of Jerusalem because, indeed, it was in Jerusalem, not in France or Italy. However, the case of Baldwin IV was instrumental in the generalized shunning of "lepers" which went in full swing in the West at the end of the 12th century. 

With all the caveats explained above, Fort Assiniboine was founded in 1823 (under the name "Athabaska River House" -- the renaming occurred at some unspecified date around mid-19th century). At that time, the area was on the edge of the influence zone of a loose group of tribes who, by the European classifications used at that time, were designated as "Assiniboine". Their vast "territory", stretching from modern Alberta to North Dakota, was considered to be under their control because they were the groups that traders dealt with; but at their demographic height they were only 10000 or so, which illustrates the limits of the concepts of control and territory. 

The article does not actually claim pre-Viking contact. We already know, from both the Icelandic Sagas and archaeology finds, that around 1000 AD, Vikings settled in Greenland, then tried it again in Newfoundland ("Vinland")(*). This latter expedition first cruised past two other pieces of land, called Helluland and Markland. These two most probably correspond to Baffin Island and Labrador, respectively. An important point is that both Iceland and, even more, Greenland, lacked a good source of wood. Wood was a scarce resource, yet crucial for building houses, ships and tools in Viking society. The coast of Labrador is ripe with trees, and the name "Markland" reflects it (it means "Forest Land"). Therefore it is quite plausible that Vikings from Greenland and possibly Iceland would regularly make the trip to Markland, not to settle but to fell trees. Indeed an Icelandic document from 1347 reports a ship going off course and landing in Iceland while in the process of returning from Markland (the probable intended destination being Greenland). We know that sagas tend to report only heroic feats, and lumberjacking was probably not heroic enough to warrant its own verse. If we accept the idea of at least semi-regular trips between Greenland and Labrador, following the navigational course that goes near Baffin Island, then it is highly probable that some parties actually made landfall on Baffin Island at least occasionally, if only in case of bad weather or emergency repairs. The artefacts reported by Sutherland then make a lot of sense. They don't actually imply either a permanent settlement or trade relationships with Inuit people, but they show presence. A settlement would be problematic because Vikings tended to rely on cattle for food, and maintaining cattle on the definitely non-grassy coast of Baffin Island would be very challenging. The Greenland settlements were abandoned in the 15th century, which hints at Vikings unable or unwilling to alter their lifestyle into more "Inuitic" practices. If Vikings stopped on Baffin Island for anything else than immediate survival, then a trading post would be much more plausible than a true settlement. Yarn and sticks don't unambiguously point to Vikings, as opposed to other European societies of that time; that's what is meant by the expression "or other Europeans". But Vikings were in the vicinity (Greenland, and briefly in Newfoundland), had the seafaring abilities, and the navigational knowledge (the road had been reconnoitred), and the economical motive (wood from Markland). Invoking other people is a bit far-fetched. To sum up, the archaeological evidence more indicates Viking exploration (or possibly settlement or trade) on Baffin Island than non-Viking or pre-Viking contact. However, it does show that these things were happening relatively early, around 1000 AD, that is right after the first settlement in Greenland, which makes sense since they needed wood from the very beginning. (*) We are not really sure that Vinland is Newfoundland, though the Anse-aux-Meadows site certainly matches the sagas. 

How leprosy was considered in the Middle-Ages is an interesting story, because it evolved quite rapidly at the end of the 12th century, but differently depending on the place, and Baldwin IV was used as example. If you read French, read this article from Mark Gregory Pegg (it is a translation; I could not find the English original online). As a rough summary: 

So no ditch, tower, stone or any other similar construction. Note, though, the way the palisade walls "overlap" on the entrances, making them narrow and preventing a marksman from shooting into the village from the outside. Constructions meant to provide elevated places for sharpshooters were apparently not used before being introduced by Europeans (along with firearms), the archetypal example being the one built by Samuel de Champlain to help in the attack of an Iroquois village. 

"Western Civilization" is a very loosely defined expression. It can be more or less whatever you want it to mean. Usually, however, when we talk of "Western", we implicitly place ourselves in a modern context, where Western civilization really means "industrialized countries with a large middle-class and partaking to a common set of values which includes consumption of hamburgers". Roughly speaking, this encompasses USA, Canada, the richer half of Europe, and Japan. Depending on who is speaking, considerable variation may occur in this list, but the important point is that it is always anchored in recent times. Sumer is 4000 years old. There is no clear-cut separation of "civilizations" with well-defined boundaries, except in the extreme cases of 100% geographical separation; e.g. pre-columbian societies in Americas had been separate from eurasian societies since before the invention of cities, hence before the notion of "civilization" can actually be defined. On the other hand, societies in India have incorporated elements from Greece (Greco-Buddhist art is a blatant symptom of this), so if you want to follow your "continuum" then "Western Civilization" would have to include India as well; and then China, if Buddhism is promoted to "Western" status. The notion of "Western" vs "Oriental" then becomes meaningless. At best, we can try to talk about "ethnies" and trace them through languages; languages spoken by most people (but not all) in Europe and North America come from the Indo-European family. That family also includes the majority languages spoken in "oriental" countries nowadays (Iran, Pakistan, India...); but Sumerian is not indo-european. In that (very loose) sense, Sumer should be considered as "less western" than modern Iran. But really, the notion of "Western Civilization" is not well-defined. 

That is what I call scientific dedication. And a clue that in 1921 some people were still quite crazy about spiritualism. 

Religion is a great cultural differentiator. People have been killing each other for many millenia, with a preference for targeting other people who belong to a distinct "culture", a rather loose term. From the outside, the god(s) people worship are quite easy to work out; if they are not the same as yours, then these people are "foreigners". Historically, religion began to be a concept distinct from its host culture around 400 BC, at the time when true monotheism was invented. Before that period, there was no real difference, in the minds of people, between "your god is weaker than mine" and "your god does not exist"; early "monotheisms" such as Zoroastrianism and Mosaic Judaism were more properly defined as monolatrisms. The invention of the concept of monotheism came with the equally novel notion of your religion being something else than your ethnicity or culture; at that point, it became possible to die and kill for strictly religious reasons. However, for persecutions to begin in earnest, it still required another ingredient: proselytism. In the Roman Empire, Jews were a troublesome component: conquest of Judea by Rome was not easy, and plagued by regular rebellions; but they were a people and their unrest was more political than religious. They did not try to expand their religion to other inhabitants of the Empire (especially after the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD: Judaism then restructured itself around the concept of orthodoxy, which de facto excluded the previously active non-mainstream branches which did try a bit of proselytism). When Christianism appeared, it added the new component of proselytism, not only among Jews but also for all other humans (seemingly impulsed by the newly converted Paul of Tarse, against the advice of James the Just). Due to the exclusive nature of Christian worship, this lead to tensions with the Roman power, then persecution; and since the Christians were not defined by anything else than their religion (they were otherwise indistinguishable Roman citizens or slaves), the persecution was, necessarily, of a religious nature. Compounding the effect was the promise of an afterlife, with bonus granted in case of death when bearing witness of the new religion: that's what is called martyrdom. There is no martyr for Apollo or Jupiter, because when you die in the name of such deities, well, you still die, and you get no specific after-death benefit for it. With Jesus, martyrdom scores a VIP seat. To sum up, you may get religious persecutions when all of the following hold: 

The observation that apples fall to the ground is not significant in itself. What matters is the conceptual jump that Newton performed, while (as he reports) sitting in his garden. Before Newton, the conundrum was expressed as: "if apples fall, why does the Moon stay in the sky ?". The breakthrough was Newton suddenly realizing that it was the wrong question: the Moon is also falling toward the Earth ! But it has enough lateral movement to "keep missing" (that which we now call "being in orbit"). Newton could think that because he had already come up with the realization that when an object moves, it has, by itself, no reason not to keep moving: you have to push a trolley to set it in motion, but you also have to do something to stop it. Prior to Galileo, everybody was convinced that a moving object could not keep moving indefinitely; every object, by itself, had to stop. Galileo was first to demonstrate that it was not true -- actually, the first to come up with the idea that trying things out was a better way to demonstrate things in physics than just thinking about them abstractly. Newton, with new mathematical tools ("infinitesimal calculus" -- an idea that Leibniz also got independently at around the same time), could formalize it as his first law. With that knowledge, he could imagine, finally, that if the Moon had some lateral movement, then it would keep on having lateral movement and thus keep on missing the Earth while it falls towards it. It all crystallized in his head at some point where he was, mostly, at rest in a quiet environment. As Nietzsche is believed to have once said: "all truly great thoughts are conceived by walking." It is thus kind of fitting that Newton made one of the biggest advances of physics of all time while observing something as mundane as an apple falling. Such is the way the human brain works. (Incidentally, the apple story has been used to pinpoint the exact date of the scientific breakthrough, since apples fall only at a specific period in autumn. However, the story is a nice story that was reported only by Newton, who knew how to sell his ideas, so the story might be a myth after all.) 

It really depends on what you mean by "supposed to be practically in charge". Supposed by whom ? If the war rages on and the leader does not even know, then one can confidently say that the leader does not hold the actual power, which is instead in the hands of people who perfectly know that the leader is not actually leading. One situation which is similar to what you are looking for is what happened at the siege of Szigetvár in 1566. On September 6th, the attacking party's leader (none other than Suleiman the Magnificent) died in his tent. We don't really know the actual cause (he was more than 70 at that time, so it may very well have been a "natural cause"). The inner circle of councillors kept that death secret, and the siege kept on; the day after, the Ottomans actually broke through the defences and stormed the city. For a few weeks, the war continued, and the nominal leader was unaware of it because he was already dead at that time. If you want a situation where the nominal sovereign is kept in his closed palace, pampered by some prime minister or general, and kept aloof of the external world to the point of not knowing what happens at all, then plausible candidates are the late Merovingian kings in what would later on become France. As Wikipedia describes for the last one, Childeric III:
