I ride a lot of trails where it is almost impossible to ride up and sometimes not even practical to push the bike up, and it is easier to carry. I've got a full suspension mountain bike with no space inside of the triangle, so it is not possible to shoulder it. And carry a bike on my back, rather than on a shoulder. Bottom tube is resting on my shoulders with rear wheel on right from my head and front wheel on left from my head. Like that: 

As already said, Shimano used to manufacture Silient Clutch rear hub. But that has been stopped a few years ago, so if you manage to source one - you are lucky man. 

I used to have one of them and it was truly silent. It was heavier than standard shimano LX hub, but it was silent and with instant engagement. Also I used Chris King hubs. If you put a lot of grease in their mechanism - they also become silent. Pretty much with most of the freewheels, if you put a lot of thick grease in them, you'll silent them for some time. Unless you ride Hope hubs -) I've heard about Stealth hubs - they are claimed to be silent, but I never had a chance to try them out. You might as well read this thread about silent hubs for further information. 

I used to have single-speed commute bike. Then switched to 9-speed setup for commuting. I find no significant difference in lifespan of chains and chainrings. The obvious advantage of single-speeder is constant nearly perfect chainline. This means your chain is never bent. But most of the times chains die by getting stretched. And equally good chains will get stretched the same way on a single-speed or multi-gear setup. As already been noted, I would not take into account chain-wear when choosing between single or multi-speeded bikes. 

Unless by "hybrid" you mean something different. I understand that you are asking if brakes exist where both fluid and cable are used in propelling pads to rim or rotor. UPD: If such thing exist, please let me know, I'll be very interested! UPD 2: I stand corrected. Turns out these exist. See Kibbee's answer. 

In my 14 years cycling career only once I had to replace rotor due to wear. And that rotor was 6 years old and used for heavy downhill riding in all conditions. I've gone through a lot of pads on that rotor (like 20-30 pairs). And only when I could actually feel with my fingers the groove on the surface, I replaced it. Also it started eating pads like mad - uneven breaking surface wore pads much quicker. I'd say rotors is something you would not replace quite often. And rotors would not fail on you like a worn-out rims - rotors won't split easily. So for a sake of measurements, 30% thickness reduction would be a good indication to replace the poor thing. 

Tyre lifespan very much depends on a tyre, use and rubber quality. Some high end tyres for MTB racing have very soft compound and they do not last long. A season of riding, if lucky. On the other side you can get hard-rubber commuting tyres that can last you more than 10K miles. Tubes are good as long as they hold air. In my student days I used to have tubes with about 30 patches and they worked OK. Tubes are not like tyres, they don't wear out with mileage. So don't worry about it. 

The pros you see on the videos set their saddle depending on the DH course. If the course has a lot of possibilities for pedalling and not many drops - set it high, so on flat sections they can rest their bum on the seat and give it a full pedalling power. If the course is rough and steep - no racer will have the seat high. So you should do. You know what you are riding, you know that you are going to do drops - set the seat low. And leaning back is not always wrong. As long as you don't overdo it and don't send yourself flipping backwards. It all takes practice and time. If on the drop you let your suspension handle it all and keep your legs straight - at some point suspension will bottom out and shock through your straight legs will go into your spine. And that is a direct ticket to spinal injury. So the best is to learn to to do a bit of both - work your legs and let the suspension do work as well. If you feel that the landing is going to be rough - move yourself to the side a bit, protect your groin, take the hit with your thigh. You might crash in that case, but your kids will be happier -) And one more thing, in DH drops to flat higher than 5 feet are very rare and are considered dangerous. It's not trails for you, where guys carefully absorb 10ft flat-drop with their whole body. On the other hand, drops to transition do require different technique (comparing to drop to flat) and give less stress on a bike and a rider. 

Back in my student days, I could not afford full-suspension bike, so I rode hardtail with fat tyres and clipless pedals (to keep feet in position). The ride was rough, but I was not much slower than my mates on full-suspension bikes on the same trails. And sometimes when the trail was toooo technical (downhill trials), I was ahead of them. No hospital bills, no injuries related to type of bike. If you are choosing what bike to get, but can't afford full suspension, go for the hardtail. Later on you'll figure out what exactly you need from the bike and how much suspension to get. 

By looking on the shape of the tooth on the biggest cog, it looks worn out and a time for a replacement. Grinding feeling on a clean chain is always a sign of wear. Also worn-out cassette will will wear out chains much quicker. And you already feel that - second chain got only 50% of usage from the first chain. I would just replace the cassette, before the new chain is also stretched out. p.s. you are far too precise with your mileage! 

On MTB you don't get such thing as 2-chainring cranksets. Cranksets come in parts: cranks, bottom bracket and chainrings. If you are buying crankset separately, chainrings are not included. This is to provide a better flexibility in chainring selection: different materials, shapes and tooth numbers. On cheap cranksets you can not separate chainrings, and in this case you'll need to replace the whole assembly. So one of your options would be to check if your crankset allows to remove the granny ring. If you have chainring bolts there, you are in luck: take the granny ring off and adjust the front mech. If your chainrings are moulded into the crankset, you'll have to replace the crankset, and that might be not a simple business. In this case it's quite likely that you have square taper bottom bracket and these days it is not easy to find a descent crankset for square taper. So you'll have to replace the bottom bracket as well... and this can be a world of cash spent just for removing a granny ring. Not really worth it, unless you want a better quality/lighter cranks. 

If you are not worried about cosmetics, these dents won't affect the frame at all. I had a massive dent on top tube of my Ti trials bike from bad crash. And rode the bike for years after that. And nothing happened to the frame. Titanium is very good in for this. Dents won't affect the overall lifespan. 

I've recently upgraded my wife's bike from 7 to 9. I replaced rear hub (old hub had threaded freewheel, not cassette), chain, cassette, rear mech and shifter. Also replaced gear cables (as inner and outer) but that might not be required. It is likely that you'll need to do all of that. Even if your hub has 7sp cassette mount, it is unlikely to accommodate 9sp cassette, as they have different width. Quite a radical upgrade, but well worth it! 

For the last 5 years I've been too lazy to change spd shoes to normal shoes. So I picked my SPD shoes to be a bit more comfortable for walking. Usual scenario for me - commute to destination. Walk there most of the day. Commute back. When I was in Uni, I have done a lot of waking on campus in SPD shoes. Here are my observations: 

It all very much depend on your conditions. If you have a lot of dirt and grime on the road, expect pads to wear out quicker. I'd say adjust pads position after 600km is normal, nothing to worry about. 

Bottoming out of a fork CAN cause a failure of a fork. I'm speaking from my experience where I ruined 2 DH forks in a space of a week. Both by bottoming out on harsh landings. However, this might be a fault of the fork construction (both of them were the same brand/model). While you are talking about XC and tame trail, I can't see the same things happening to you. I've bottomed out forks many times without failures. Bottoming out is not nice, but the forks survived in most cases (apart from the 2 above). So go and play with the air pressure. You'll feel that air is lacking before you bottom out. Just pump some air in. Also, air forks are working as a progressive springs, so you'll need to try hard to bottom out 30% sag on 120mm travel. 

I think that cleaning with water is the problem. You wash them overnight, leave the bike outside. Water freezes inside of the breaks. You splash hot water again in the morning and get more water on your breaks and behind the pads that will freeze later on. I would try avoid using water in your daily clean. Just try it for couple times. Clean the pads with dry cloth and make sure there is no water in the system. And see how it works next day. To be honest, I have never experienced this kind of problem. And I've used disk brakes for the last 10 years in very different conditions, including thin wet mud all over the bike, brakes and pads. And I never got mud between pistons and break pads. So I think the problem with "magnetically held" pads. My pads always been held in place by a spring. So if you have this option, try changing the breaks, but make sure that new breaks hold the pads with a spring, not magnets. 

Unless you really care how the bike looks and about extra 50 grams on the bike... Find a piece of old chain. Wash and clean it. Find a piece of old tube, best would be road bike tube. Measure the distance between saddle rails and top chains - double it and you'll need that much of tube and chain. Cut the tube and chain to the measures. Pull the chain through the tube, lock the chain around your chainstay and seat rail. Tube is required so chain does not rattle too much and does not damage the paintwork. Works against opportunistic thief who doesn't have chain tool. 

It helps if you have a backpack, as the bottom tube rests on it. After some practice you can have both of your hands free, while bike comfortably sits on pack. This way bike does not get in your way and you can hike quite a big distances. UPD: This position is not the quickest to put the bike up, but I find it the most comfortable when climbing. To get the bike up, stand on non-chain side of a bike, place left pedal (closes to you) in the lowest position, grab with one hand the left crank and fork stantion with the other hand. Lift the bike over your head and on your shoulder/backpack. 

The cranks are always spun in the same direction and the threads are located so the cups don't get loose. The headset does not have a direction where the spinning is happening and it is not possible to have self-tighning cups. Also fork gives vertical load, directed into the threads. Also there is a big frontal load on the fork which will be transferred into single directional side-load on a thread. A thread can cope with each of these factors separately, but both of these, combined with constant vibrating, will eventually cause the thread to fail, especially in aluminium frame. 

0.05mm is nothing. Stop worrying about it. As long as rotor does not make noise or drags extensively on the pads, you'll be fine. Rotors change shape every time you ride: you apply breaks a little longer than couple seconds, rotor heats up and expands, then cools down and shrinks. On extended periods of braking rotors can heat up enough to burn your fingers when you touch it (done it myself unfortunately). And when this level of temperature change is applied all sorts of transformation happens to the level of warping/runout. So you can spend all the time in the world to make rotor as true as possible, then you go for a ride and it all changed and rotor is nothing like you've left is last time when you fiddled with it.
