(I'd like to add that this question has zero political motivation. I'm an American reading about British, and west European, imperialism in the 19th century, and the question just struck me.) 

BACKGROUND In 1187 Saladin embarked on a campaign to retake Palestine from the Crusader Kingdoms. Thomas Asbridge describes his army as including "12,000 professional cavalrymen ... 30,000 volunteers" from "Egypt, Syria, the Jazira and Diyar Bakr". Ethnically, the army was composed first of Turks, and then Kurds, with the largest contingent being Turcomen nomadic tribes. But it also included remnants of the old Fatimid army, such as Arabs (Egyptian, Syrian, Bedouin), Nubians or sudani, and Berbers from the Western Sahara. It seems like these ethnic identities played a key role in determining one's role and status within the army. Turks were prized as cavalry, including mamluks and Turcomen horse-archers, who were said to be impatient and war-like. Kurds fought "as distinct units" and their cavalry rode "shaven horses", favoring swords over lances. Nubians were "famous infantry archers" who used large powerful bows instead of composites, and no shields of any kind. Arabs were "proud of their reputation as hard-riding light cavalry", and said to be excellent lancers and raiders. Bedouin Arabs often fought as longbow infantry archers alongside horsemen. 

Background: I've started a bit of side reading on Mesoamerica immediately prior to the Spanish conquest. The Maya, the Aztecs, and (to the south) the Inca all seem very straightforward to me, but (as I'm new to the region and period) once I start getting into Zapotecs, Mixtecs, Mixe, etc, I admit that I start having trouble keeping things straight. I'd like to get a firmer idea of who the other peoples surrounding the Aztec and Mayan states were so I can start to get a more complete political and cultural picture of the region. Question: Could someone please give a breakdown of the major cultural and political differences between the lesser known peoples / politcal groups that were active in Mesoamerica, c. 1520? 

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that Bayle was considered to be a skeptic in many ways. He was engaged in theological debate his whole life, but at a time when atheists were extraordinarily rare. As a son of a priest I think it's hard to believe he was an outright atheist, but he was certainly not a devout believer. He seems to be a person that was a little ahead of his time. 

Actually, I'm reading a book, "Turing's Cathedral" that discusses the development of computers. From my reading of the book it appears that the principal developments in computing, with respect to actually engineering a device that could implement computing principles, and bringing a product to market, occurred in the United States. The research in the United States was devoted to making a machine which could handle the computations necessary for the development of nuclear weapons. I would check out a brief history of the computing developments at the Institute for Advanced Studies. 

I do not think that there exists evidence to show that the founding fathers anticipated a civil war would break out over the issue of slavery. The founding fathers were largely against the institution of slavery, but the southern delegates (where the economy was completely dependent upon slavery) were for the institution. There were some steps taken to mitigate the effects of slavery. There is no mention of the word "slave," or "slavery" in the Constitution. The importation of slaves was to become illegal by 1808, so the founders had in place a system to limit the increase via importation. Southern states wanted slaves to be counted as full people for appropriation purposes, but that was eventually narrowed down to 3/5ths. The reality was that the founders didn't think they could make the US work without the support of the Southern states and as such they punted on the slavery issue, but managed to sneak in the power to regulate slavery with the importation ban. The discussions of the Constitutional Convention show a desire to do away with the institution, but nothing about potential war resulting from allowing the institution to persist.

A emphasis on the dangers of religious pollution is a recognizable part of many ancient and medieval cultures, but it would appear some much more than others. The first three societies that come to my own mind are ancient Greece, classical and medieval Japan, and the medieval Islamic world. All of these cultures, deservedly or not, also have a strong reputation for controlling the movement, social interactions, and sexuality of at least upper class women. Religious and sexual purity are not the same thing, but the two are often closely linked in our own time. It seems fairly intuitive to me that societies which put greater emphasis on avoiding spiritual pollution might also be more likely to exercise tight control over women. (But I am of course not implying the former is required for the latter.) I was wondering if speaking in terms of social history or anthropology, there's anything meaningful to be said about a relationship between these two values? Alternatively, feel free to offer counterexamples or evidence that I'm seeing something that's not really there. 

Bounty Edit: The bounty is already reserved, when the 24 hour requirement is up I'm giving it to J Asia for providing such an extensive answer. All of the answers were great however, so thanks to all three of you. 

Background: I'm reading Shogun, and enjoying it enormously, but the portrayal of the samurai, their families, and their subordinates as authoritarian and death-obsessed has been setting off warning bells. It seems likely to me that Clavell has an interest in playing up the exotic and "oriental" aspects of Japanese culture to keep with his theme of cultural clash. I'm also skeptical about the sustainability of putting whole villages to the sword over trivial offenses, the likelihood that so many of the Japanese characters would be eager to commit seppuku, and the suggestion that the samurai would have been totally baffled by the Christian commitment to love and value all human life. To be clear, I'm not looking to smear Clavell-- he intersperses the above elements with more positive depictions of the samurai, harsh criticisms of the Europeans, and a good dose of universal realpolitik to boot. I'm also interested in the theme of cultural conflict, and think it's both real and valid. But I'm also aware that so called east-west divisions are often simplified or overstated. Question: How accurate is the portrayal of fatalistic samurai culture in Shogun? 

I can't seem to find information about economists, or others, warning about the overheated stock market of the 1920s in the US that would culminate in the stock market crashing on Black Thursday, October 24th, 1929, and Black Tuesday, October 29th, 1929. I keep seeing general statements that "prudent experts" warned about the overheated stock market, but that is it. If you could provide paper names, or books, published prior to those dates that would be great. If it has to be a post-event book, or paper, it needs to be one that provides the names who warned against the possibility of a crash. 

Short Answer: No, the colonists were not referring to a specific document. The colonists were referring to the fact that they believed it was beyond the powers of Parliament to tax them because the colonists did not have representation in Parliament. Long Answer: The American colonists were not referring to a specific document like the Magna Carta, or any other document for that matter. It is important to remember that at this time the colonists still thought of themselves as part of the British empire. As such, the colonists were referring to the British concept of a constitution, unwritten as pointed out by Semaphore, where the Parliament had specific powers, and the people had certain rights. There are, however, historical documents like the Magna Carta that make up the British constitution. The colonists would have been quite familiar with the British "constitution." As Bernard Bailyn put it, what was within the constitution was an "arrangement of governmental institutions, laws, and customs together with the principles and goals that animated them." (66-71). Bailyn quotes John Adams, who wrote a constitution of government is "a frame, a scheme, a system, a combination of powers for a certain end, namely, the good of the whole community." (68). Pauline Meir states in American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence that "Americans took particular pride in being governed under Britain's unwritten constitution, which they considered the most perfect form of government ever invented." (29). The issue in the case of the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, was one of taxation without representation. The colonies did not have representatives in the Parliament. Up to the time of the Stamp Act the American colonies had been largely left alone by Parliament, meaning they had not been subject to internal taxes and left to govern their affairs largely on their own. This period was known as salutary neglect. When the Stamp Act was passed it was the first major internal tax on the colonies, and as Walter Issacson points out Benjamin Franklin believed it "unwise, perhaps even unconstitutional, for Parliament to levy an internal tax on people who had no representation in that assembly." (222). Whether or not this was a correct interpretation is besides the point. The point is that the consensus in the colonies eventually became that the Parliament lacked the power to levy such taxes, because of the representation issue. As a commenter on the question noted in referring to a Constitutional History of the American Revolution: The Authority to Tax, the colonists believed that such powers could only be executed by their local officials, not by Parliament itself. (Reid 9-11). In a way, the colonists concept of what was or wasn't constitutional is not that different from our present day idea of what is or isn't constitutional. Namely, is what the government doing within the powers possessed by the government, ie constitutional? References 

Bonus Question: I'm guessing the answer to this question begins with China being reopened in the 70s, but was there ever any significant toy trade prior to the revolution of 1949? Bonus Bonus Question: Based on comments made below, if anyone wants to expand their answer to also include more general information on the history of toy imports from east to west, that would also be great, and possibly worth a bounty. But as per site rules the original question stands as is. 

I'm researching dress in 18th century Britain. This article claims the following: "Brits stopped wearing wigs after William Pitt levied a tax on hair powder in 1795." The date seems odd to me, because I could have sworn I once read a social history that claimed a Briton "wouldn't be caught dead in a wig" by the 1780s, or even the 70s, and backed it up with a quote from a contemporary letter. But I can't be sure I'm remembering correctly. The book Daily Life in 18th Century Britain says that that "wigs went out of fashion for good (except in the law courts) at the end of the century, when powder taxes and sympathies for the French revolutionaries made short, natural hair the rage." If this is right, it implies multiple causes (and also taxes plural) and a slower phase out than just 1795. The political and fashionable aspects also make me wonder if it may have been first ditched by the young or politically left. Odd as it may seem, I'd like to know the status of the wig down to the year, because my project focuses on 1793-94. So, when did the British gentry do away with the wig? Secondarily, did it go very suddenly, or did any particular group stop wearing them first? Was it ever politically controversial? And on a final note, did Britain uniformly adopt short hair, or was there greater variation? 

"The world must be made safe for democracy." - Woodrow Wilson The irony of Wilson's quote is that WWI did not directly make the world safe for democracy. In fact WWI directly led to the rise of state socialism in the former Russian Empire with its evolution into the USSR, and the rise of fascism in Italy and Germany. From a European standpoint WWI bankrupted the continent and the subsequent reparations imposed on Germany led to, among other things, WWII. The worldwide Great Depression was a huge contributing factor to the rise of these ideologies. In Russia, WWI was the straw that broke the Tsarist empire's back. The Russian people were dissatisfied with the prosecution of the war and the strain it put on the country contributed to the successful rise of the Bolsheviks. So WWI helped secure the communist victory in Russia. In Italy, WWI had been a huge economic burden on the country and when the treaties were signed Italy was not given its "fair share" and they felt slighted which led to a fertile environment of nationalism for Il Duce ("Benito Mussolini") to eventually take office. Il Duce of course ushered in the Fascist government in Italy. Likewise, in Germany, the German people felt they were too severely punished by post-WWI treaties. This like Italy led to an environment where German nationalism was high, but also in Germany there was severe hyper-inflation destroying the German economy. Hitler exploited these conditions to unify the people behind his idea of a "Third Reich" and lead the continent to war. As far as democracy, after WWI not many nations around the world were democratic. The idea of democracy that we have today (with full suffrage, and robust elections) was not completely mature. It would not be until after WWII that democracy would begin to spread around the world. Really, democracy did not spread to the developing worlds until the decolonization period post-WWII when many colonizer nations simply could not afford their far flung empires. So in answer to your question WWI did not do a great deal to shape the particular ideological beliefs of each particular system. However, the events of WWI set in motion the sequence that lead to a great deal of democratization. I'm not sure if that exactly answers your question, because it appears that you maybe are looking for more of a political theory type answer than a spread of democracy type answer.
