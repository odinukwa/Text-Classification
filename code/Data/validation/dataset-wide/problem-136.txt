Consider the equivalent case today: heredity. When you are born, your parents pass on their skills to you. They also pass on other things; their network of contacts, their money, and so on. If you inherited the mind of someone powerful, you would inherit the location of the money that they cached for themselves towards the end of their previous life, in the assumption that they would be coming back for it - a mnemonic for a swiss bank account or whatever. You would inherit the contacts, the other powerful people - friendships in your previous life would continue. So would enmities. You are essentially immortal; almost any power you might have gained from living forever, can be a power you gain from being reincarnated with perfect recall. It will become a commonplace in wills that one's inheritance would pass not to one's descendants, but to one's reincarnated self. That business empire would be placed into the hands of a pro-tem manager, but when you come back and key in the code to identify yourself, you take over the reins again. Legally, it would take very little time before ownership and identity were redefined to account for these temporary lapses of existence. Some debts would last past death; you couldn't get an education, then kill yourself to avoid the student loans but keep the knowledge. The death penalty would not be given. War would be very different. The purpose of genocide would be to skew the demographics of one's foe, to scatter them over the earth, and to separate them from their property long enough for it to be seized. Murder would be considered less serious, though probably still seen as the most serious assault you could perform on someone. Suicide would go down in some groups (no longer an "easy way out" for the depressed), but up in others (it becomes a way of rebelling with only relatively minor consequences; there would be groups of people who enjoyed childhood enough to want to remain children indefinitely, killing themselves when they get too old). Birth rates would go down, WAY down, to the point that population growth may reverse. Having a child that's the creation of the two partners, and helping them form their personality, and make their start in the world is one thing; but the risk of playing mommy and daddy to a cuckoo who was created and mentally formed by an earlier set of parents hundreds or thousands of years ago... not appealing to most. We're selfish about kids. There's a reason adoption and fostering levels are always lower than they need to be. As birth rates fall, the probability of getting a reincarnated person becomes a certainty. Passing on our body's genes is as close as we get to immortality, but in a system of guaranteed reincarnation, bodies become irrelevant. We don't need to pass on genes. Instead, we pass on our selves. Another point of kids is care into our old age; that would no longer be an issue. If you become too old to look after yourself, then kill yourself, and you'll immediately get loving parents who will look after you. The only people who'd have kids would be those who actively enjoyed child-rearing; or those who were paid to have them by some social schemes paid into by the dying (a "birth tax" charged on the dying?) So... drifted off-topic a little, but yeah - the social connections you made, and the financial and business inheritances you had, would give an enormous first-mover advantage over those who weren't reincarnated; but there would be fewer and fewer births, so reincarnations wouldn't be guaranteed. 

Here's another approach often used: embrace the fact that magic is OP and can break the world. In fact, magic DID break the world. What's left of the world is rebuilding. Magic is viewed with suspicion. There are a few fragments of magical knowledge left, but not enough to form an overarching theory. You find a glowing sword here which seems to kill people who touch it within a week, but no explanation why, or how to protect yourself; a bag of runes that has a different effect depending which two runes you pull out; whole libraries with scrolls of recipes for common spells, but no understanding of the language they were written in other than understanding how to read it phonetically to get the right effect. Scrolls are easy enough to copy, and experimentation has allowed people to label most of the scrolls, at least where the effect was immediate. Those who can memorize the incantations rather than read them are at an advantage. Even these dregs of power are enough to make mages more powerful, but not indescribably so; only like someone having access to modern technology in medieval days. Eventually, with research, the historical levels of magic might be reached again. Many are trying to, but many more are trying to stamp it out entirely to prevent history from repeating itself. Entire great libraries have been destroyed in this pursuit. Researchers regularly get burned at the stake. 

Edit: the above answer focused on the core assumption that our form was inevitable. But I guess I might as well address the other assumptions, though others have already done this well. 

I agree - it's also important to have the sensors near the central nervous system, because nerve length relates to reaction time. 

The technologies used to defend the population at large - and the army camps, etc - against insects, would be the same as we defend against mosquitoes in the real world. So bug screens in windows and doors; mosquito nets around beds; fogging of populated areas; innoculations; and as others have said, bug spray. The technologies used during combat would be the same as mosquitoes and bees; so gloves, and beekeepers' hats; and again the bug spray. 

The $URL$ a short-period version of which is championed by astronaut Buzz Aldrin is a proposal that accomplishes exactly this for you. 

Darn, the ones I was going to suggest have already been suggested. Lett's try to think of some more. Using up all of a resource. Perhaps they rely on some very complex chemical compound that they cannot reproduce (or for cultural reasons, are not willing to begin research into). The planet where the Spice is formed has a sun that'll go nova. They can't/wont transplant it. They could all rely for their longevity on a single invention or device, controlled by a single person, company or organisation or religion, which loses the ability or desire to maintain those longevity devices. Like Josiah's "genetic factors", they have a degenerative disease or population imbalance, which again they cannot or will not solve: perhaps they only noticed too late that their birth rate has become insufficient to restore their death rate. Like the grey goo suggestion, and the voluntary suicide idea, they could hit the Singularity: their computers and robots could ultimately make their way of life completely pointless. They could be working on a problem that would culturally destroy them: such as "is there a God", and finding definitive evidence that they were wrong would cause mass death. Perhaps they discovered a method of immortality, so they just stopped reproducing as it was pointless: they didn't need to and it was wasteful of resources. Birthing in their hives, once done by queens, was no longer needed, and the queens, now being equal but having far higher needs for resources, were often rebelled against. And it was only some time after the last queen died, wen each planet asked around and discovered there were none to import, that they realized the immortality was ultimately their death warrant. Or perhaps, as with vampires of lore, their immortality brought infertility. Economic considerations would mean that it's in a planet's best interests to grant immortality to all citizens, so's best to compete against other planets which have to spend the extra investment in nurturing the young and senescence of the elderly. And it was only once everyone was immortal that they realized they were all doomed. 

If we look at the imaginations of futurologists of yesteryear, and their expectations of what we'd have today, two things stand out, at least to me: 

Assume the top of a hill covered by 10k people is, say, 100m square. You'd be hard-pressed to have 100k people in a smaller area and still have them ready to repel attackers. That's a rabbit every square meter. That's not a lot of rabbit. And a winebottle spilled over a square meter is just a little puddle. Just based on bunny-corpse-density, which is not something I expected to be using as a measurement this early in the evening, I'm thinking there'll be negligible effect. Your odds of standing on a bunny are small, and for war-chargers, trained in galloping over the fields of the dead, are negligible. So you have 100m square, covered in dead bunnies and wine. BUT. What if it's not wine? What if it's whiskey? So you have 100m square, covered in dead bunnies and good Scotch! That's an entirely different proposition. See, in the latter case, you drop a torch, and the whole hill is covered in an eerie blue flame that the commander is standing in apparently unhurt, while the stench of blood and burning hair rises from the bunnies. Would that be enough to break a cavalry charge by people who believe in magic? I think maybe. 

One component of visual detection could be fish oil. Or olive oil. While glass-bottomed boats/buoys have been suggested, the problem with glass is that it requires a lot of glass. When I was a child in Corfu, the Greek fishermen wanting to see into the water would pour a tiny splash - no more than a teaspoon - of olive oil onto the ocean surface (Olive oil being the universal panacea for everything in Corfu, used for everything from treating skin ailments to lighting fires, treating wood, a lubricating machinery, preserving food, rustproofing, frying, you name it). This would quickly spread out, to form a molecule-thick layer atop the water, completely changing the optical behavior of the water surface nearby, so that rather than just the reflective, sparkling ripples, you could suddenly see clear to the bottom. Having it contained by a hoop would improve the efficiency, but it holds itself together pretty well anyway, remaining for minutes at a time, at least in the relatively calm waters of the Ionian sea. Basically it just reduces the reflectivity and fractal choppiness of the water surface. I think the layer of surface-tension on the water is very refractive, and the oil prevents this, even in the tiniest of doses. It works surprisingly well, like a magic spell that gives you an instant window into the water to see the glittering diced-rainbow of the fish swirling below. [To be absolutely clear: this is a tiny localized film around the spotter, who would need no more than a couple of flasks per DAY, not an environmental disaster where the sea-life will need cleaning and oil will need containing within booms and so on.]
