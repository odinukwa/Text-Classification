Many companies have policies relating to how employee behavior represents the company even on personal time. For instance, say your employee is a binge drinker and posts photos of himself getting black out drunk on social media. Obviously, this will reflect poorly on your organization if people saw these posts. It could affect their desire to do business with you. And it could cost you money. Therefore, the company can most likely terminate the employee (consult a lawyer) for violating company policy (namely harming the company's reputation). Furthermore, people get canned for their personal beliefs often, just look at the recent Google debacle. In your case, I think it's even simpler than that. Said employee has cost you business. Now it is up to you to determine if the value of the employee outweighs the cost of lost business. If current clients were disgusted enough to discontinue doing business with you, then how many clients have you lost before they even walked through the door? As an aside, and in support of your clients, I too decide to do or not do business with companies based upon the values a particular business purports to uphold. I vote with my wallet. Politics is unfortunately serious business these days. I don't think your clients are an exceptional case. I think you should consult a lawyer and I think you should establish a written policy that addresses how employee behavior affects the company reputation as a baseline and then go from there. I think you can try to salvage the situation if you can get the employee to agree to stop posting the controversial posts. However, if they are passionate about their beliefs they may not be willing to do so and at that point you have a decision to make: your employee or your bottom line. 

I'd recommend you contact the manager again via email and address your concerns squarely (with a little more detail/finesse of course): 

+1 for your realization that you're not the expert as this is the first failure point for countless teams/debates/projects. This is one thing you should play into an advantage. Every professional has an ego, however small. Someone who reckons he's a subject matter expert will like to have another person defer to him in matters concerning. From this position, you can quietly slip in your ideas and questions to your "mentor".

I wouldn't worry, if I were you. And I wouldn't make excuses for my results to an employer either. I'd pride myself in my body of work, years of experience and anything else I'd gotten right along the line. Any employer who's more interested in the number of assignments I turned in on time in university is probably not going to value my blood and sweat 

A vast majority of "cold calls" made by recruiters are just bots / scrapers. They scan your profile or resume for keywords and then email you with a generic canned message. That is why they cannot / do not differentiate between "a little experience" and "a lot," it's almost always just a positive hit on the keyword match. So the appropriate response is to just delete the message if you are not interested. If you are interested, then reach out to them and they will discuss your experience and capabilities at that point and tell you if they think you are a good fit or not. Most jobs have flexibility (within reason) with regard to the requirements. You won't know unless you ask. Even if the recruiter did read your profile and write you a message, he either made a mistake or misread. I think the rules still apply for a cold call... if you're interested you reply, if not ignore. 

I want to add a different perspective to answer the general case. In an ideal world, employers would prioritize human beings over business. However, many times this is unfortunately not the case. Often, people feel pressured to go to work even when they are ill and this results in the spread of sickness. So where does this pressure to not take sick time come from? Subconsciously, they know they may be judged or penalized for taking unscheduled time off. That being said, I think the effects of calling out sick early in your employment is highly dependent on the organization. There are some/many jobs that would probably not hesitate to fire you for calling out sick in the first 90 days. In your case it worked out nicely (as it should). But I write this answer so that others contemplating the same situation have additional context to make a decision on. In my opinion, if you have something minor that can be managed with medications then it's probably best to show up and just explain to others that you are feeling a little under the weather. If they are a good organization they will probably tell you to take off and come back when you feel better. Obviously, you had the flu and fever, and in that case you have no choice but to bite the bullet and take the time off regardless of the outcome. Just call in and speak to your manager and explain the situation. If they are smart, they will realize getting the rest of the team sick is worse than having you work when you are ill. Some supporting anecdotes Anecdote #1: I was once "written up" for going to the ER. And that was after years of service. Utterly, disgraceful. But this should illustrate how low some organizations are willing to stoop. Anecdote #2: A very similar situation occurred on the first day of an important job for me. I caught a cold and I got zero sleep (literally) the day of my start day. I calculated the risk of calling out on my first day was too great and so I rolled up my sleeves, loaded up on meds, told everyone to not shake my hand, and started the job. That was a rough week, but things worked out well. 

Next, write a short email. (Short, because no one will read a long one.) Focus on what's in it for everyone. If you frequently have customers, write about projecting a professional image. If you only have internal meetings, draw attention to how the next meeting's participants don't need to clean up everyone's trash. For instance: 

This will depend on the country, the business and other factors. A 40% turnover translates into an average tenure of two and a half years. Is that long or short for your conditions? People in Europe will stay longer at their jobs than in the US. Average tenure in the retail business at the associate level in the US can be as low as 6 months, so 40% turnover will be very low for US retailers at this hierarchy level. If I were in a business with a critical need for experienced people with a certain tenure, I would be concerned at such a figure, but it really depends. 

Future employers will rarely care about whether you did an interesting project. They care about results achieved and problems solved. Don't give the impression of someone who likes to work on interesting projects that fail and don't deliver real results. Instead, explain how you can learn even from failures and improve your methods. You could cast this as follows: 

Most answers have covered working in a free market system, where your expenses do not dictate what the job will pay. Two entities are free to set their prices and when they agree, there is a deal. I want to add additional perspective. Compensation is measured in more than dollars Job rates generally should factor in COL requirements, and generally you'll see higher rates in more expensive areas. However, compensation should to be measured in more than dollars. In your friend's case and many college student's cases their first jobs, internships, and coops will have sub-standard wages. But the wages are not the complete compensation. These companies are taking higher risk by taking on employees with little to no experience. There is going to be higher administrative costs per unit work of these entry level employees (more review, checking, grooming, mentoring, etc...) They offer you access to real-world on-the-job experience. That real-world experience is what is going to set you on a growth path for the rest of your career. Your friend's compensation package (and other interns / coops) is something more like this: 

All of these are certainly valid in a job with a global scope. Then again, most non-native speakers of English will likely have a better command of English than you do of their native language, so you will likely communicate in English most of the time. So I would say that the key point why you should mention your language skill is that they show a certain openness to foreign cultures on your part, which can be a very valuable "soft skill", indeed. Of course, you should make sure to convey that your skills are pretty basic. The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages is pretty much Europe-focused, but using some such classification scheme would be helpful in parsing your CV. 

Don't sweat this overly. As an intern, you likely make a lot less than the others, and they know that. In addition, it's only for two weeks. Not really a big deal. Of course, a little present would be appreciated. Perhaps a medium-priced bottle of wine for each of them (assuming they all take turns driving), which might set you back more-or-less exactly the price of one tank full of gas. Or chocolate. 

The only exceptions I would make to the above, is for someone that has some sort of disability, or English as a second language. If someone cannot be bothered with pleasantries, then I cannot be bothered to forward their information and I definitely would not recommend them for employment. A google search of 5 minutes would have resulted with the appropriate way to reply, regardless of age. (Even better attach a current copy of your CV or resume in the response.) Utterly lazy. 

You simply state something along the lines of "My current salary is not relevant to this discussion (and hold firm). I expect compensation commensurate with my experience and expected job responsibilities." If they push, just say since we are sharing personal details ask them what they are currently making, or ask what the budget is for the role (don't actually do this unless they just are not getting it). Watch as they deflect. That should be your clue as to their intention. The key here is to research what salaries are commensurate for your level of experience and job title. This will give you the confidence to hold firm on your salary expectations and to make sure that your expectation is realistic with market conditions. This is especially true in the case you are underpaid. Story time: I have been underpaid in the past, and it was uncomfortable holding my ground and refusing to answer the current salary question. Even the job application listed "current salary." I simply put "$0". Naturally, if they wanted to press the issue they could've said I lied on the application, but I made it clear that my current salary was not relevant--so I was not going to answer the question even on the application. Furthermore, HR even made statements "he must be underpaid, that's why he won't reveal his current salary." I simply let these statements roll off my back. I do not care if they assume I am underpaid, overpaid, or not paid. As I said, holding the mindset that "current compensation is not relevant to this discussion" is critical. Also you have to be comfortable with the fact that you may lose job opportunities because of this. I was comfortable with that fact and things worked out in the end. The way I view it as, why should I be doing HR's job? Their job is to evaluate what compensation is fair for the services I will offer. It's not my job to give them a shortcut so they can shortchange me with the veneer of "well we gave him $x raise over his current salary so we did him a solid!" Yeah, no. (As an aside, the other trick they will use is "what is your salary range" basically, do you think they will offer you the top of the range or the bottom?) 

You're not aware of whatever approvals, preparations have already gone towards carving out your price from the budget. You can't be sure that there is room for amendment after the necessary approvals have been granted for a previous figure. I'm not sure any hiring manager will want to jump through his corporation's red tape for such an increase. What is your bargaining chip? Certainly not your experience. On what grounds are you going to ask them to up the ante? You've in essence indicated how much you think you're worth by dropping a figure. What has changed between then and now to improve your market value to the prospective employer? It's your first gig. Unless you have a couple of other offers lined up, you're taking a risk by calling their bluff on this. Unless you have a niche set of skills (a mainframe programmer perhaps), they might not have any motivation to acquiesce your request. 

Generally, you're poorly positioned to increase your asking price if you don't have a cogent reason to. Look on the bright side: in a year or two, with a good performance on the job, you can negotiate a raise or at least change jobs. The salary you've negotiated now should just be a starting bar in your career, not the final destination. 

Finally, if you see someone cleaning up later on, remember to thank him or her. Show that you notice and that you appreciate the effort. Conversely, if someone doesn't do this, ask him gently and politely to do one of the three things (not all three things, this will come across as nagging). There will likely be a couple of people who will never change. Don't focus on those. Focus on the (hopefully) 80% of your colleagues who actually will make an effort. (I may be a bit optimistic there.) Smile frequently. It does help in changing people. 

You should really have discussed a potential counter-offer from your current employer before accepting the new offer. Give them a deadline if necessary. "I need to accept or reject the offer from the potential new employer by Friday. Please think about whether you can and want to give me an attractive counter-offer in writing by that time." Accepting an offer from a new employer and then deciding to go with the counter-offer is unprofessional, there is no way around it, and you won't be able to sugarcoat it very much. If you did immediately request a counter-offer from your current employer, but they were late about making it, the unprofessionalism lies with them. In this case, you can tell the alternative employer that the counter-offer was late in coming. (Without badmouthing your current employer.) 

Has your boss been known to put himself on the line for people or he's doing this just for you? I ask this so you're not unnecessarily guilted into a long term favour-repaying mission. The most solid way to repay confidence and faith placed in you is to vindicate and justify that input with solid output. And you're aware that there is a need for more hands on deck. It's safe to offer your time and effort to your boss (above and beyond the call of normal working hours) seeing as he's done the same in your favour. Try not to think of it as a favour while you're at it, more like justifying his input in your career. At the barest minimum, he'd appreciate the gesture (even if he declines) and know you're not just a taker and you also own a conscience. Should you choose to accept more responsibility however, be sure to not carry too much or more weight that you're sure you can safely handle. All your goodwill reserves will go down the tank if you end up botching your assignments because you've bitten more than you can chew. Few good deeds go unpunished! 

If you are adjacent to not one, but four meeting rooms, all used by different people, there will be a lot of meeting traffic. I doubt you will be able to reeducate all of them on elementary politeness. (My personal impression is that most people who are considerate enough to actually keep a request such as yours in mind are already considerate enough to close meeting room doors in the first place.) Getting people to change their behavior in the long run is very hard. Our office assistants keep asking people to erase whiteboards and tidy up meeting rooms - every time they send an email, things improve for a week, then go back to the way they were before. It looks to me like you will need to close the doors yourselves on meetings, and ask people that continue their meeting right behind your chair to move away... for the foreseeable future. Yes, that is certainly a possible course of action, as others have written, but my guess is you will get tired of it, plus it's a lot of distraction. (Good exercise, though.) My recommendation: try educating people and closing doors. If you find yourself closing doors on meetings more than doing actual work, talk to your manager and ask whether you could be assigned a different desk. Nobody should need to sit right next to four meeting rooms, anyway; there will always be far too much noise there. Much better to convert this space to a lounge-type area, or set up the office supply cabinet, or something, and move people's desks somewhere farther away.
