You may have issues with toe overlap, especially with a fixed gear. The smaller frame will mean your cranks are closer to the front wheel, so your toes could touch the tyre when you turn tightly. And with a fixed gear, the pedals are turning all of the time, so more chance of this happening. Its debatable as to whether toe overlap is a problem or not - some people find it annoying or dangerous, others soon get used to it. It will depend on the frame geometry as to how much difference a smaller frame makes to toe overlap. You can reduce toe overlap by changing to shorter cranks, which may suit you better if you are not very tall. Also narrower tyres would give more clearance. 

Also some websites will let you draw a route, then save it as a file, without an account. eg GPSies For updating the firmware, you can use Garmin WebUpdater software. 

It seems most of it is mapped on OpenStreetMap. You can use the Waymarked Trails website to view it on a map. 

They look like the same bike to me. Its just different shops listing them in different ways. As far as I can tell, the specifications are exactly the same, but those shops have listed the parts in different ways. eg one has listed both hubs together, the other has them separately. And one specifies what saddle it is, the other doesn't. Both shops are showing the same photo. Checking the 2013 Cannondale website, it just lists the F29 CARBON 3, no mention of "Flash". It looks like Flash was a brand used for the 2012 range, but for 2013 it is has been abbreviated to just "F". 

I would like to take my quadcopter to interesting places. So I can do some flying and aerial photography etc. Assuming a reasonably large quadcopter or drone - eg DJI Phantom, Cheerson CX-20, Syma X8C, or similar style. So about 350mm x 350mm square, and about 150 mm deep with the legs. It is possible to reduce this size a bit, by removing the propellers, legs, and camera, but I would rather not do that before each flight. Plus the accessories required, eg the controller, spare batteries and camera. So how to carry it comfortably and safely on a bike? Some sort of large messenger bag, or a rucksack? Or some way of attaching it to a rack? It would need something to protect it from getting bashed, ie some sort of padding. And preferably some sort of cover to keep the rain off. 

I'm not sure how the Edge 1000 works, and whether or not it allows showing multiple tracks. Some other Garmin models can do this (ie Etrex), but they work differently in a number of ways. Yes, joining tracks in a GPX file is possible, there is a wide variety of software to do this. One option is Garmin BaseCamp, which is available as a free download for Windows or Mac OS. Or you could try EasyGPS or QLandKarte GT. Or GPX files are just XML, so you can edit them in a text editor. If you remove the and tags from the end of one track, and the and from the start of the next, this will combine them into a single track. 

Depends on just what bicycle it is, but its probably possible to add gears in some way. But it may be expensive or complicated. First thing to check is the frame spacing, ie the width between the rear dropouts. Many singlespeeds use 120mm wide hubs, whereas modern geared hubs are 130mm (road) or 135mm (mountain bike). If it is a steel frame, then it is usually possible to spring it out a bit, up to about 5mm or so, to fit a wider hub. If the frame is only 120mm, then your options are limited. There are some internal hub gears for 120mm frames, eg from Sram or Sturmey-Archer. But they are fairly expensive, or have a limited range of gears. If your frame is wide enough for a 130mm or 135mm hub, then you can use a standard road or mountain bike hub with a cassette. Then you will need to attach the derailleur. If the frame is designed for singlespeed, it won't have a derailleur hanger. But you can bolt one on, depending on what type of droputs you have. eg if you have horizontal dropouts, you could use this DMR Chain Tugs & Mech Hanger. Also the frame probably won't have guides for the gear cable. You can buy clamp on cable guides, or you could just use zip-ties to hold the cable in place. Whether all this is worth it is another question. As you will have to buy quite a few parts (wheel, cassette, derailleur, gear levers etc), which could get expensive. Plus quite a bit of work fitting it all. It may be easier just to buy a bike with gears instead. 

The Edge Touring comes with a preloaded "Garmin Cycle Map". This is based on OpenStreetMap, so you can check the OSM website to see how good coverage is for the areas you are interested in. In general, OSM is rather good for roads in most of Western Europe, and much of the USA. Many areas also have lots of cycle paths and trails mapped. It is often more accurate and up to date than other maps. Plus if something is wrong or missing, you can edit the map to fix it. The Garmin Cycle Map is designed specifically for cycling, so highlights relevant features, eg cycle paths. If using the navigation, it is designed to route you along paths or minor roads where possible. And it contains height data, so it can show elevation profiles or route to avoid hills. Note you can download other OSM based maps in Garmin format for free, then put these on the Edge instead. These are available in a variety of different styles, which you may prefer. Also they may be more up to date, which is useful if you are adding of editing things on OpenStreetMap. Or you can buy other maps from Garmin, eg City Navigator, then use these on the Edge. These can be expensive, depending on how large an area you want. And City Navigator only contains roads, not paths etc. 

Designed for trekking or commuting bikes, they have a larger plastic platform. So they look a bit bulkier, but are not actually much heavier. They have reflectors built in, which is useful if that is a legal requirement where you are. Weight: 392g (pair) PD-M324 

One option is RaceSplitter. This is an iOS app, costs $35. You will need a suitable iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch to run it on. You can enter a start list in advance. Then during the race, you just have to enter the rider number as they cross the finish line, and it will record their time. You can then publish the results on the website, and export to Excel etc. I've not tried this myself, but I have seen it in use at a few local races. It seems to work fine for timing, and they have got the results online shortly after the race. 

It would be possible to produce some custom maps based on OpenStreetMap data. And you can change the definitions of road types, which will affect the routing on the Garmin device. eg if something is tagged as a motorway in OpenStreetMap, you could make it into a cyclepath on the Garmin maps. So they Edge Touring would route along it in cycling mode. You would have to experiment to figure out what type of roads the Edge Touring prefers for routing. You could also create some Garmin maps without any routing data. Then the Edge won't be able to route along roads, so it should just give you a straight line to the destination. Creating Garmin maps can be a bit complicated. The usual software is Mkgmap. Look at creating custom styles, which define how OpenStreetMap tags are converted to features on the Garmin map. A useful guide at cferro.net - Custom Garmin maps For most modern Garmins, you can load multiple maps onto an SD card, and then select which one to use. So you could load maps for different routing modes, and choose which one to enable. I'm not sure whether the Edge Touring supports this. Otherwise, you can put the maps on separate MicroSD cards, and swap between them as required.
