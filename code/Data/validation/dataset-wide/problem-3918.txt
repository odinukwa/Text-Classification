This happens in differentially closed fields. The model theoretic algebraic closure of a $A$ is just the field theoretic algebraic closure of the differential field generated by $A$. This will rarely be a differentially closed field. For example, if $A$ is contained in the constants, then its algebraic closure will be as well. 

Yes. If $F$ is another such field, then $F$ would embed over ${\mathbb R}$ into $K$ so $F$ would also be a transcendence degree 1 extension of $\mathbb R$. We can find $s\in K$ and $t\in F$ with ${\mathbb R} < r,s$. The ordered fields ${\mathbb R}(s)$ and ${\mathbb R} (t)$ are isomorphic. Thus their real closures $K$ and $F$ are isomorphic. 

I think the main idea goes back to the following paper. Erdös, P.; Gillman, L.; Henriksen, M. An isomorphism theorem for real-closed fields. Ann. of Math. (2) 61, (1955). 542–554. 

The standard use in model theory is something like this. A partial type $p$ is internal to a type $q$ if there is a definable function $f$ such that any realization of $p$ is equal to $f(c_1,\dots,c_m)$ where $c_1,\dots,c_m$ are realizations of $q$. A typical example from differential fields: Let $X$ be the set of solutions of a linear differential equation of order $n$. Then $X$ is internal to the constants. Let $a_1,\dots,a_n$ be a fundamental system of solutions. Let $f(c_1,\dots,c_n)=\sum c_ia_i$. Then every element of $X$ is the image of an $n$-tuple of constants. 

Jan Denef once pointed out to me that this is a simple consequence of the Manin-Mumford Conjecture, i.e., Raynaud's Theorem that if $A$ is an Abelian variety defined over a number field and $C$ is a curve on $A$ that is not a coset of an abelian subvariety then $C$ contains only finitely many torsion points. In this problem we may assume that $A$ has no proper abelian subvarieties. If $A$ has dimension at least 2, take $C$ any curve on $A$ defined over $\bar k$, then $C(\bar k)$ is infinite, but contains only finitely many torsion points. If $A$ is an elliptic curve, let $C$ be any curve of genus at least 2 on $A\times A$. Again, $C(\bar k)$ contains only finitely many torsion points. 

To me one of the more fascinating aspects of the surreals is that application by Kruskal and others to construct higher order asymptotic expansions. For example, if you want to understand the asymptotics of the function $$f(x)= {1\over 1-x}+e^{-1/x}$$ on $(0,\epsilon)$ and differentiate it from $g(x)={1\over 1-x}$ you look at the ``series" $$1+x+x^2+x^3+\dots+e^{-1/x}.$$ Kruskal and his co-authors have used surreal numbers to give an approach to these expansions and applications. This type of expansion can also be be dealt with using the transseries of Ecalle or the logarithmic-exponential series developed in model theory. 

For the second example, let $M$ be the natural numbers and let $N$ be the integers greater than or equal to -1. Then $M$ is a substructure of $N$ but $M\models$ ``0 is the least element", while this is false in $N$. Thus the theory is not model complete. The first example is similar, let $M$ be $[0,1]$ and let $N$ be $[-1,1]$. Again $M\models$ ``0 is the least element" but the extension $N$ does not. One equivalent of model completeness is that every formula is equivalent to an existential formula. So theories like true arithmetic, the theory of the natural numbers in the language {$+,\cdot,0,1$}, are far from model complete. 

It is known that neither of these number theoretic results can be proved if the base theory is weakened to allow induction only for quantifier free formulas. 

I have two, somewhat conflicting, views on this. From the point of view of modern model theory, the Compactness Theorem is central to almost everything in the model theory of first order logic, while the Completeness Theorem is almost irrelevant. Completeness comes into play when proving the decidability of complete recursively axiomatized theories or in dealing with recursively saturated models for example, but these are not very central. Even when we want to apply Completeness, what's important is that the set of logical consequences of $T$ is recursively enumerable in $T$--the details of the proof system are of no importance whatsoever. This explains why in my model theory book, while I do explain that Compactness is an almost trivial consequence of Completeness, I give a direct Henkin-style proof. Nevertheless, I view the Completeness Theorem as one of the great intellectual achievements of our subject. The fact that the semantic notion of "logical consequence" can be captured by the syntactic notion of "proof" is really surprising. The first is, a priori, $\Pi_1$ over the universe of sets, while the second is recursively enumerable. I find this amazing. 

Just like with algebraically closed fields, for completeness you need to specify the characteristic of the field and the characteristic of the residue field. There is a general trick if you have a theory $T$ with quantifier elimination and a structure $A$ that is embedded in every model of $T$, then $T$ is complete. Let $M$ and $N$ be models of $T$ and let $\phi$ be any sentence. There is a quantifier free sentence $\psi$ that is equivalent to $\phi$ in models of $T$. But, since $\psi$ is quantifier free, $$M\models \psi\Leftrightarrow A\models\psi\Leftrightarrow N \models\psi.$$ Thus $M\models\phi\Leftrightarrow N\models \phi$. Now, suppose you are looking at characteristic 0 fields with characteristic p residue field. The rationals with the p-adic valuation are a substructure of any model of ACVF of characteristic $0$ with characteristic $p$ residue field. 

One "classical" application of nonstandard methods to number theory is the approach of Robinson and Roquette to the Siegel-Mahler-Thue Theorem. Robinson, A.; Roquette, P. On the finiteness theorem of Siegel and Mahler concerning Diophantine equations. J. Number Theory 7 (1975), 121–176. 

One of my favorite applications is Leo Harrington's proof that a computable differential field has a computable differential closure. This is the only proof I know that the differential closure of the constant field of rationals is computable. 

My recollection is that Macintyre proved there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ complete theories of pairs $(K,L)$ where $L\subset K$ are real closed fields. This is in his thesis but I don't think he published it anywhere else. There are later papers of Francoise Delon and Walter Bauer that develop this further. On the other hand there is an earlier theorem of Robinson's that if $L\subset K$ are real closed and $L$ is dense in $K$ then the theory of $(K,L)$ is decidable. 

Sheperdson showed that if there are recursive nonstandard models of open induction--the theory where the induction axioms are restricted to quantifier free formulas. The construction is algebraic. Let $R$ be the real algebraic numbers. Let $K$ be the field of Puiseux series over R, that is series in $t^{1/n}$ with coefficients from $R$ for each natural number $n$. Then let $M$ be the elements of $K$ of the form $f+n$ where $n$ is an integer, $f=0$ or all exponents in $f$ are negative, and the leading coefficient of $f+n$ is positive. Then $M$ is a model of open induction. To show how weak this theory is $\sqrt 2$ is rational in $M$. In the other hand, George Wilmers showed that if you consider IE$_1$ the theory where you allow induction over formulas with only bounded existential quantifier, then there are no computable models improving a theorem of McAloon's for I$\Delta_0$--though I'm not sure it's known if IE$_1$ is actually weaker than I$\Delta_0$.
