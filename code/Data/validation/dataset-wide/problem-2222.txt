Both of the racquets you referenced are made of lower quality materials. They're not necessarily "bad" racquets (especially for a beginner such as yourself) but they differ from higher quality racquets in specific ways such as: 

Hopefully this answers your question about the WTA Finals - it's right on their website: $URL$ As for the men's changes over the years, it seems like you've pretty much answered your own question with the link you posted. 

Ah, the old debate about the 5th set tiebreaker. Some love it, some hate it. If you were to ask the players themselves, I think most would prefer the 5th set to end in a tiebreak so that you don't potentially end up with a 5th set score of something like 20-18 and play an extra 2 or 3 sets worth of games to decide the winner. Personally, I think it's better for fans and people watching matches to not have really prolonged matches that can become boring and lose interest from the fans. When it really comes down to it though - the real answer involves stuff like television and media scheduling. The US Open has had their "Super Saturday" thing for a long time - where the 2 men's semifinals are played along with the women's final on the second Saturday of the event. In order to make sure the matches conclude in a "timely" manner - the 5th set tiebreak is used to help make sure the men's semifinal matches don't go on for too long and mess up the schedule for the day. Seems like kind of a silly reason but, it is what it is. If you ask those involved in running the tournament (USTA) you usually get an answer like "it's what makes the US Open unique" or some other PR-scrubbed answer but in actuality it really just boils down to keeping the schedule running smoothly. Interestingly enough, the US Open introduced the 5th set tiebreak in 1970 - a few years before the other 3 majors switched to playing out the 5th set. Wimbledon's current 5th set rules were changed in 1979, The Australian Open's in 1971, and the French Open in 1973 - to what you see in use today by those events. 

I haven't heard much of anything about the balls being faster - but there are definitely other factors that have contributed to serve and volley (S&V) becoming a much less common playing style in tennis these days. The balls used across ATP tournaments are generally the same (Head ATP is the official ball brand of the mens tour currently), with the exception of the brand used at Wimbledon - I think Wimbledon uses a Slazenger grass-specific ball that has a little bit more bounce to it since the grass at Wimbledon provides the least amount of bounce compared to clay and hard court surfaces. As far as what has contributed to the decline of S&V style tennis - there are several factors but there is one that stands out above the rest and is sort of the cause of the other factors. It's the strings. Advances in string technology (mainly polyester strings) have made it so that players can take a bigger, harder swing at the ball and at the same time generate more topspin so that the ball stays in the court. Also, tennis players - physically speaking - have followed the trend seen in other sports and are now generally taller, stronger and faster on average than the players seen in prior decades (70's/80's/90's). Grass court tennis (what little of it is played each year) actually used to be considered the fastest surface of all and saw a lot of "boring" matches played where the number of aces and service winners hit was much higher than on other surfaces. To try and make grass court tennis a little more interesting, over the past decade or so (at Wimbledon) they have added a little bit of sand to the ground beneath the grass in order to slow the grass game down just a little bit. So taking all of these factors into consideration together (the strings, player physicality and surface changes) - it means that a tennis player in today's game trying to execute a serve & volley style game has to face faster returns with more topspin on the ball, and an opponent that can run down more of your volleys than in prior decades and a surface that is giving S&V tennis less of an advantage than it used to. In the end, serve & volley tennis just isn't seen as being as effective as baseline tennis from a numbers & percentages standpoint - and tennis is all about the percentages. The margin between winners and losers at the top of the game is very thin and plenty of matches are won by just a couple of points here and there going one player's way. Since serve & volley isn't seen as being as effective, this also means that fewer players want to develop a game around it and fewer coaches try to teach it to junior players. This effect just kind of implodes inward on itself and now you have a style of game that very rarely includes serve & volley tennis. 

The speed of overhead smashes that are hit during tennis points are not recorded (or at least if they are recorded, those metrics are not kept or stored anywhere permanent). The speed of the serve is mostly a gimmick for the fans to observe and - to my knowledge - it's only matches on the show courts at the 4 majors where any kind of statistics around serve speed is recorded and the data is kept as part of match statistics. If I had to guess, however, it would probably be Roddick against Federer at Wimbledon ;). See this clip: $URL$ 

There is definitely some element of energy conservation that some players think about and so they don't put forth much effort in trying to stay in a losing set. They would rather just move on to the next set and mentally "reset" and focus on trying to improve their game in the next set instead of spending that energy (both physical and mental) on a somewhat lost cause of a set. As you stated, it is advantageous to start serving the next set so it is the most ideal situation for a player to make his opponent hold serve to end a set, so they can serve first in the next set and play from the lead, so to speak. However, sometimes they don't even care to force their opponent to serve out the set. It depends on the match and the players involved. Competitiveness and attitudes vary widely even among the pro ranks. 

A heavy chop serve is entirely different. You have to get under the ball enough so that you don't drive it into the table (or net), but not so much that you pop it up (for an easy smash by your opponent) as well as not putting too much forward motion into your shot that you hit it long/deep off the end of the table. Depending on how hard of a chop your opponent hits on the serve (and how much back or side spin the server imparts on the ball) this can be pretty tricky and it will take a fair bit of practice before you can consistently hit a good neutral return - especially if your opponent is good enough to alter the direction of the spin each time. Edit: If you watch some video clips of professional table tennis - you'll notice that they generally hit a "chop" style serve, trying to put their serve as short and low over the net as possible - this gives them the biggest advantage because:
