Yes, it was a deliberate parallel. There are few purely coincidental or insignificant details in Atlas Shrugged. One of the text's major goals is to show the "interconnectedness" of various events and causes. This was due to Ayn Rand's belief that everything had a cause, and that in order to solve today's problems you must look at their causes. (Compare this to characters like Jim that insist that it's not important to examine causes and that the important thing is the situation you actually find yourself in now). As the book states about Wesley Mouch, 

That's most likely what C. S. Lewis was thinking of, but he wouldn't necessarily expect his readers to be aware of that fact. Uncle Andrew does, in fact, appear to hold to a variant of this idea. First, who is he referring to here? "Men like me, who possess hidden wisdom" and "profound students and great thinkers and sages." The first sentence could be seen as referring especially to magicians, or it could be referring more generally to anyone who had "secret knowledge" of some kind. (I think that the former is more likely). He seems to be including magicians (like himself) in the category of "profound students and great thinkers and sages", who have special moral rules that don't apply to "ordinary" people. The question, then, is "who are the 'profound students and great thinkers and sages'?" Does being one of them make you an Übermensch? I think that we have to assume, for starters, that Uncle Andrew thinks that it makes you something like an Übermensch. At a minimum, he seems to think that being one exempts you from "ordinary" moral rules, which are just for "common people" (kids, servants, etc.). Google's dictionary defines an ubermensch as "the ideal superior man of the future who could rise above conventional Christian morality to create and impose his own values, originally described by Nietzsche in Thus Spake Zarathustra (1883–85)." So, in a word, yes - C. S. Lewis (who presumably would've been familiar with with this concept) was most likely thinking of this concept when he wrote this. TL;DR Yes, he did consider himself an Übermensch (or, at least, something very much like one). 

Is C. S. Lewis endorsing annihilationism (i.e. "conditional immortality", where some people become immortal and others either cease to exist or cease to be conscious) here? His statement that "You could see that they had suddenly ceased to be Talking Beasts" and that they "disappeared into his huge black shadow" seems to suggest "yes," but his statement that "I don't know what became of them" seems to suggest that Lewis is deliberately trying to avoid taking a position on exactly what happened to them. 

It had apparently never occurred to him that "Who is John Galt?" was referring to the John Galt he knew. Once he did think of it, though, he was absolutely terrified by the possibility that the John Galt he knew was the one that they were talking about. Before that, he was also evidently rather disgusted and disappointed that no one had heard of John Galt yet, because he was expecting that he would become famous. When John was captured and asked to see Robert Stadler, Dr. Stadler begged not to be forced to see him. As soon as he went in to see John, he immediately started protesting that "he couldn't help it" and started trying to rationalize his behavior (in fact, before John even said anything if I remember correctly - I couldn't locate the quote for that, though). Ironically, Stadler's office at the State Science Institute was described as "a small room that looked like the office of the bookkeeper of an unsuccessful firm." 

According to Rand, giving your child milk isn't sacrifice because you value your child. Keeping your child alive is, in fact, benefiting you. It's only a sacrifice if you value the milk (or what you could've purchased with the equivalent cash) more than you value your child. By giving the child the milk, you're trading a lesser value (the milk) in exchange for a greater value (the survival of your child). Speaking of the altruistic concept of "virtue": 

"back, Jack..." sounds so much like "blackjack" that evidently a fair number of people think that that's what they're singing. (I'll admit that I did until I looked up the lyrics). Is this purely coincidental, or was it intentional? 

This makes it sound like the song is addressed to an "ordinary" friend that he just hasn't seen in awhile. The next verse seems to reinforce that: 

One of the big jokes in Catch-22 is Major Major's striking resemblance to Henry Fonda. Why did Joseph Heller choose Henry Fonda in particular? Is there any significance to the choice, or was it a somewhat arbitrary choice of someone that the audience was likely to have seen (or at least heard of) before? 

Given that all but the most important parts of the manual were intact, presumably one of them did remove it. (Most likely, it was William Hastings who removed it, given that John Galt simply walked out of the factory and William Hastings didn't quit until the next day). In addition to the selectively-removed page, we also have the fact that John evidently regarded the knowledge about the motor as his intellectual property. Later in the book, he's seen collecting royalties on the power plant from Midas Mulligan, and at the end of the book he agrees to do a job for Taggart Transcontinental designing new engines based on his motor. Fundamentally, the book treats it as his motor, not just the 20th Century Motor Company's motor. 

I've heard a variety of interpretations of Hotel California by The Eagles: the "high life" in Los Angeles, a journey from innocence to experience, greed in the music industry, drug addiction. (Confusingly enough, the band seems to have confirmed several of these interpretations). Regardless of which of these interpretations is "correct," though, I'm particularly interested in the final verse: 

Related question on Sci Fi SE: Did Calvin ever realise that Hobbes was not real? I do realize that this is a somewhat old question, but I'm first going to challenge the premise of the question a little bit: what do you mean by "real"? Real in what sense? If by "real" you mean "what would a video camera show?", that's ambiguous by design (as some of the other answers have pointed out). Watterson deliberately didn't resolve that in the strip; he consciously tried to make it not be provable either way from the strip. In fact, even in a strip where Calvin takes photographs of Hobbes, Calvin and his dad just see different things, so it doesn't really resolve which view was "true." I think that the important thing is the characters' point of view, not who's "correct." In fact, I'm not even convinced that the question is even meaningful in terms of the strip. From the perspective of Calvin's parents, Hobbes is a toy; from Calvin's point of view, he's real. You could argue that there's a real sense in which the different points of view are equally "correct" in terms of the universe of the comic strip. Either way, it's not important, "provable," or even necessarily meaningful to ask about which is correct. 

We can't definitively answer from the books whether Susan ever did that, but the books do at least hint at the possibility that Susan would grow out of the "phase" she was in. TL;DR The fact that Susan wasn't there in The Last Battle doesn't necessarily mean that she wouldn't be in the future. She had plenty of opportunities to change. With that said, we simply don't know whether she did or not. 

He was likely referring primarily to Hank Rearden (and likely secondarily to Eddie Willers as well). Francisco was already well aware that Dagny was having an affair with Hank Rearden due to his earlier confrontation with Hank in Dagny's apartment. (It's also possible that he would've heard about it from John Galt, who also knew about the affair, but this seems less likely). Given the fact that both him and Hank Rearden were heavily involved in the search (and the fact that Hank Rearden had publicly offered $100,000 - the equivalent of almost $900,000 in 2018 dollars - for anyone who could help locate the site of the wreckage of her plane), he was presumably well aware of how much Dagny meant to Hank and would've known that Hank felt like he did. On the other hand, Eddie Willers had recently revealed that he had feelings for Dagny too, and he was a longtime friend to both Dagny and Francisco, so it seems likely that he was referring to both. Presumably, Hank would've been at the forefront of his mind, though, given his involvement in the search. 

When Dagney Taggert went to see Dr. Robert Stadler at the State Science Institute, in explanation for his mistrust of humans and human reason, he told the story of his three students: 

No, it's not just a proper name. Christiana is, according to several sites I've looked at (e.g. here), simply the Latin form of "Christian." Even in English (ignoring the Latin meaning), as you noted this can simply be a "feminized" version of the word "Christian." Also note: if you drop the letter "a" from the end, this is simply "Christian." In order to argue that this was "just" a proper name in the same sense that "John" or "Joe" was, you'd have to argue that this linguistic relationship was purely a coincidence (which strikes me as wildly implausible, both from a linguistic perspective and from the perspective of the text). The "best" way to translate this would, I think, be if you could simply "feminize" the word "Christian" somehow. (Many languages have at least some way of doing that). Also, I wouldn't necessarily go so far as to say that Matthew, Joseph, Samuel, and James aren't allegorical (or, at least, symbolic). I can't defend a specific allegorical "meaning" for these names offhand, but I think it's very significant that all of these are Biblical names - for example, Samuel was a priest, prophet, judge in Israel. Joseph was the name of both a Biblical patriarch and the father of Jesus. Matthew wrote one of the Gospels, and James was also a prominent leader of the early church and Biblical author. 

If there was only one catch, why is it "Catch-22"? I had always thought that "Catch-22" was "the catch after Catch 21 and the catch before Catch 23". Or was it that that particular policy (the one on when you could be grounded) only had one catch and that the other catches applied to other policies? Or that Catch-22 was the "summation" of all the other catches in some sense (because Catch-22 means that they have the right to do anything you don't have the power to stop them from doing)? 

In The Last Battle, several of Susan's close relatives (including all of her siblings) were killed on the same day in a train crash. The book merely mentions that she was no longer a friend of Narnia, and that she was in a particularly silly phase of life where she only cared about parties. The fact that the book refers to that in the present tense implies that Susan still felt that way (even after the train crash). Why did she apparently persist in that even after the death of all of her siblings on the same day? Why didn't that make her reconsider, and why doesn't the book note her reaction to the event? This seems like a highly abnormal reaction to that kind of a personal tragedy at a minimum. Or was Peter merely unaware of Susan's current mental state when he stated that she's no longer a friend of Narnia (given that he couldn't exactly visit earth to see how she was handling the whole thing)? But, if that's the case, how do we account for C. S. Lewis's comments on her being in a particularly silly phase of life? 

However, he offered him a position as a Crouching Shadow. Was that the main reason he was permitted to take the exam in the first place? The Overseer didn't seem aware of his uncle's (supposed) death until shortly before telling Sunan about their decision, and Sunan had been studying for the exam under his uncle for years. Given those facts, how could they possibly have known that Sunan would be expected to replace his uncle? And if that wasn't their plan, why was Sunan permitted to take the exam in the first place if they never intended to accept him as a scholar even if he passed the exam? 

Later, when Dagney saw Stadler on a different occasion, it becomes clear that Dr. Stadler didn't want to believe that "who is John Galt?" referred to the John Galt he knew. 

That being said, there were a few possible ways that the Thought Police could've discovered what they were reading, most of which would've been problematic even without a title page. For example: 

On the other hand, when Cheryl Taggart finally realized how evil her husband Jim was, she visited Dagny to discuss the matter. They emphasized their connection to each other and discussed philosophy, with Dagny calling her her "sister... by choice" (not through Jim, as emphasized by Cheryl). Upon returning home, she discovered the fact that Jim had just had an affair with Hank Reardon's wife. She confronted him on that as well as his "overall" evil, demanding to know why he had married her in the first place. At the end of their confrontation, she concluded that 

I realize that Ayn Rand couldn't reveal that his third student was John Galt at that point, but why did he say that? Dr. Stadler had shown considerable degree of obliviousness (both feigned and real - he appeared to be only dimly aware of the statement issued by Dr. Floyd Farris, he had to be reminded that Taggart Transcontinental was building a new branch line from Rearden Metal, and he pretended not to know about the properties of Rearden Metal); he appeared to have lost much of his will for personally investigating things at that point (such as Floyd Farris's activity). Was he simply too oblivious to know the phrase "Who is John Galt?" Alternatively, is he kidding himself about it being a different John Galt? (I have a vague recollection that that's the case from later in the book, but I can't remember exactly where). Or is he lying? And why didn't he actually state John Galt's name? 

The comments give several examples of its use prior to the publication of Catch-22. It's difficult to know the extent to which Heller was aware of these, but at a minimum, he technically wasn't the inventor of the term. @PeterShor mentioned the OED citation "1949 Amer. Speech ... The magician may speak of disappearing or vanishing a card." @user14111 also mentioned "1897 Chem. News 19 Mar. 143 We progressively disappear the faces of the dodecahedron." It's quite possible that Heller thought that he invented the term. On the one hand, he had degrees in English and taught English in college, so presumably would've been aware of the existence of the OED; that being said, it's possible that he had read the entry. The fact that Yossarian was baffled by the use and insisted that the word made no sense in its context would suggest that the characters didn't know about the usage, and possibly that the author didn't, either. While that technically doesn't prove the point, I think that the most likely explanation is that Heller simply didn't know about other usages and thought that he was inventing the phrase (which he technically didn't). It wouldn't be the first time he invented (or tried to invent) terms, either. TL;DR Heller didn't technically invent the usage, but it's quite possible (even perhaps likely) that he thought that he did. Either way, the book was instrumental in popularizing the usage.
