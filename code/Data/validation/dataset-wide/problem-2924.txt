This is a question whose answers likely number in the thousands. In fact, ontology is a major branch of philosophy dedicated entirely to answering your question. Ontology can be contrasted with epistemology, which concerns what we can know. The boundary between the two is full of contrasting theories which try to link the two, as you do with your question "So how can we call our reality real?" Perhaps of specific interest to you would be the exploration of physicalism, dualism, and idealism, along with the myriad of pluralist approach. 

What you describe is the general structure of a mathematical paper. Words regarding the mathematical discovery are paired with precise mathematical notations to demonstrate correctness. However, a general version of this is tricky. If a philosopher says "Here's natural argument A and here's formal argument B. As the author of both, I say they are intended to be the same" that's one thing. However, if we try to say "here's a process that lets you turn the crank on A to produce B," we have to question whether the process works right. Indeed, proofs by folk like Tarski showed very particular limits on processes like you describe. It's very hard for a language to prove it's own semantics, and most of the languages we are interested in when talking about proofs are simply not capable of it. Of course, there is a way to do this. What defines a "correct logical reasoning in natural language?" If the definition is "there exists a corresponding formal logical proof," then the answer to your question becomes yes! You might be interested in looking at Attempo Controlled English (ACE). ACE does the dual of what you seek. It is a way to write precise formal logic in a format which native speakers of English can read as though it were natural English. If you read it naturally, you get the right intuition. If you read if formally, you get the right formal meaning. 

A digital mind is not lossless. A digital mind may lose information. Indeed, if it has any sort of storage limits, like a harddrive or a tape, it must lose information or simply run out space with which to store the result of perceptions! The way a digital mind loses content is different. Analog signals degrade continuously over time. Digital information is lost when you destroy information. It's what happens when you take a bit which contains information because it can be a 1 or a 0, and set it to be 0 (which contains no information, because it can only be in one state). Just like deleting files on your hard drive, the information is lost. Now what may help for understanding the gap between the models known as the digital mind and the analog mind is to throw away your assumptions about time. Phrasings in your question like "... loss of information over a period of time..." and "... would have a latency in each clink of the mechanism relative to continuous time" imply that you are thinking about digial minds using an analog concept of time. To use an analog concept of time and have the digital mind be aware of it (or able to measure it) requires a mixed analog/digital mind, which is a more complicated set of topics to explore. 

Your side of the argument has some interesting side effects which lead me to consider the requirement that an argument have premises be faulty. I would agree with WillO that the most accepted form of argument would be a Formal Proof. This form of argument is the most accepted because its language is the most precise, leading to a surprising resilience against vacuous arguments. Each Formal Proof starts with a finite set of axioms, which I believe can safely be compared to your word "premises" without loss of generality. WillO's claim is that it is valid for that finite set of axioms to be the empty set, and nothing immediately comes to mind to countermand that. Forbidding the empty set also has an interesting implication: A proof with zero axioms may be deemed "invalid," but a proof with one axiom: "P or not P" magically becomes valid, even if P never appears in the proof. Forbidding this rather absurd looking tactic is difficult. How do you claim "an axiom is assumed true," but forbid axioms that are provably true? What about proofs which depend on an unproven theory (such as the Riemann Zeta theorem)? Do all such proofs become invalid if the Riemann Zeta theorem is proven, simply because one axiom is now provably true? I think it would be difficult if not impossible to meaningfully reject a Formal Proof with an empty set of axioms without causing a large number of undesirable artifacts. Given the popularity of that form of argument, I would say that should be case closed for the debate unless someone can find quotes otherwise. 

Consider it as a linguist exercise. We live in a world that is dominated by science, so science gets to define a surprisingly large portion of our vocabulary. Accordingly, things that are "scientific" are "real," and "magic" is "fake." Part of the issue is that we often approach magic in the form of very far-fetched scenarios. Much of what we know of as "magic" is illusion. In fact, if you talk to magicians, many of them would prefer to be called illusionists, reserving "magic" for something greater than their art. They recognize their illusions are easily marked as "fake," though the smiles they bring to people's faces are certainly real. There are other definitions of magic which cling to "real" better than movie magic or illusionist magic does. There is the magic of a supreme artist. I live in the cold hard world of science most of my life, but I still get a slight uncanny feeling watching a real artist pick up their instruments. Watching a Japanese caligrapher pick up their pen, a martial artist pick up their staff, or a surgeon pick up their tools, I get a feeling deep down that there is a part of the world that I do not understand, but recognize as beautiful. I have no words for it besides "magic." Perhaps the great author Arthur C. Clarke put it best. Wedding both science and magic into one phrase, he famously declared "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." If Clarke could wed science and magic in his life, maybe we can too. Then perhaps it doesn't have to be fake for us either. We call love "magic" too... 

If I may borrow from a non-Western culture, consider the concept of the Dao(ÈÅì). It is a fascinating concept which is almost certainly outside of the realm of logical possibility because, as Laozi put it, "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao". Surely one would need to be able to enumerate it (via speech or writing) in order to determine if it is logical or not. And yet, it is. It is the is-ing, if I may try to turn "is" into a present transitive verb. It is perfectly physically possible, for it is. So it would be an example from another culture of an idea which can be imagined, is physically possible, but I would argue is logically impossible in the sense that it defies logic. 

Quantum indeterminacy is inextricable from observation because that which we consider to be "quantum indeterminacy" is related to the interpretations of QM rather than the mathematical model behind QM. (I expect this question to get migrated to Physics.SE, because it is really more of a physics question than a philosophy question. When it gets there, I know it will be seen by those who want technical accuracy. This answer is written from a very high level perspective to tie into the more philosophical aspects of QM. Please forgive any technical errors which arise from this process) When you really get down to it, QM is a model. Its a set of mathematical equations which someone argues describes the behavior of something in the real world. These mathematical equations are very well specified in the unyielding language of mathematics. If you can set up an experiment in the language of this mathematical model, everyone will reach a consensus as to what the result of the experiment will be (also in the language of this mathematical model). The tricky part is in attaching real life meanings to these mathematical devices. Consider a classical example first. Take the model , which we will call a "kinematic model." Everyone will agree that if you take , , , and , the model will predict that . That's easy. But what does it mean to say . That's the interpretation part of the problem. Once I say that "a is the acceleration of an object," "t is how long the object moves," "v_0 is the initial velocity of the object," and "x_0 is the initial position of the object", I can claim "x is the final position of the object." Until I add that interpretation, it's simply math. Once the interpretation is added, it becomes a model of the physical world around us which can be tested. So what's an "initial velocity of an object?" That's a lot of words. To describe what I mean, I'll need other words. We'll have to come to agree on a meaning of velocity, for instance. For most of physics, it is assumed that we have a consensus on the meanings of these words, so we use them casually. If I'm studying the reentry of a NASA spacecraft, I'll throw around terms like "freespace energy flux" with the assumption that everyone will agree on what that term means. With QM, it gets harder. The connection between the world we can observe empirically and the mathematics of QM is more strained than it is in other aspects of physics. We talk of things like "measurements," which are very natural concepts on the scale of human empirical interaction, but they don't quite behave intuitively when you get really small. Thus, the scientists have to take more time explaining their interpretations of how we should think of the model's reflection of reality. In fact, the entire concept of indeterminacy arises in the interpretation layer of QM. The underlying wavefunction equations are straight forward deterministic mathematical equations. Its in the application of these mathematical equations that we find the need for indeterminacy. The famous Heisenburg uncertainty principle only applies to a very particular set of states. It just so happens that, when you attempt to apply QM to reality, those states occur over and over and become very important. One of the challenges QM faced in the early days was captured in four attributes of an interpretation which were desirable. Using Einstein's terms for them, they were: 

This is a tricky one to answer because the association of youth with life and old with death is not an absolute truth in our own society, much less across multiple societies. Accordingly, there will be no answer which definitively pins youth to life and old age with death. However, there is a strong tendency to make this correlation. We can discuss why this pattern shows up again and again in cultures, we just won't arrive at the conclusion that it is a universal. I think one of the most pronounced reasons for associating life with younger age is that one of the defining characteristics of life is its potential. Things that are living have the potential to to great vibrant things. A seed has a potential to become a great tree, while the tree is already what it is going to be. We can see parallels to this idea in the Chinese concept of xue-qi. If I may grossly simplify the translations, xue is the Chinese word for blood, and Qi is their word for one's life energy: 

I have been working on a philosophical approach modeling the mind (in dualist terms, the non-physical portion of the Self) as a network of smaller minds structured to operate together. This seems to be most related to "gestalt psychology." However, I seek to apply this to concepts of Self and free will, which requires a transition from psychology to philosophy. "Gestalt philosophy" appears in remarkably few Google hits, suggesting this is either an underrepresented field or it bears another name in the realm of philosophy. Is there a name for a branch of philosophy which models topics such as the self, free will, and the mind using organizations of individual mind components? Edit: I had been terse in hopes of avoiding polluting the request for terminology with too much content which could narrow others' word choices too greatly. I also did not want to put too much in and risk the question becoming a discussion of personal philosophy (which is off topic on this SE) but to add a little more to quote Wikiepedia's "Gestalt psychology page:
