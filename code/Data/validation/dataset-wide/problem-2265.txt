I didn't take any of these photos but here are some I found online to give you an idea: Granite Lake 

Here is a pic of my old pack for reference. While I currently want an answer for this specific pack I'd prefer a more general solution. Also while I'm sure it would be the most accurate I don't know if I'd be able to handle the math needed to calculate the volume based on the complex curves and angles that make up most packs. 

I don't think you can find them anymore, but ~10 years ago Scarpa was selling a light and pretty soft plastic AT boot with toe bellows (like modern telemark boots). They were great for my Dad to transition to AT gear from 3-pin telemarking on leather boots. On wildsnow.com they have a pretty good write up about them. 

Assuming you're outdoors you could always use a drone to monitor the hunter by video. To capture the audio you could have the hunter carry a walkie-talkie with a constantly keyed microphone, or start a cellphone call and mute your end. Alternatively you could have the hunter carry a mounted GoPro, or similar camera, like a police body camera. Then you can watch the film afterward with your friend to talk about the hunt. I would think that the mounted camera would be intimidating for some people, so they might not want to interact with the chaser. Of course the camera could be a good hook for the hunter to explain the game and possibly draw people in so your mileage may vary. The drone would offer a unique vantage point and wouldn't be as likely to scare away people but it would limit the search area and require piloting skills. Either way if the videos are well done then you could upload them to YouTube, or even try to submit them to TV networks as a new type of game show. This is the reason why I think using some form of video is really the best option. Not only does it give you a way to experience the hunt, it also gives you the potential to turn your game into a bigger opportunity. At the very least this game has helped you gain and demonstrate some marketable skills. Another option is to follow the hunter surreptitiously for the first part of the hunt. Basically you will be copying/practicing the techniques demonstrated in innumerable spy/action/etc movies where one character sneaks in the shadows behind the other. This works because you don't really need to be in your spot until the hunter is close to discovering you. Of course you'll miss out on the final puzzle(s) but you will add an extra layer to the game so being the hunted is more involved and exciting. 

I am thinking about changing the backing on my reel for something thinner and stronger like gel spun line (I'm currently using 20lb Dacron). The goal is to fit enough backing into the reel for Atlantic salmon fishing. The reason is that I bought a new fly line that is both longer and thicker than the previous one, which was a sinking tip one. Now I can't fit the previous 200 yd of backing that I had. I know that the answer is to buy a larger reel, but before that I would like to try some alternatives. I have heard that there is gel spun and that some people use fireline as well, but will these work well? Will the attach well to the reel spool? Won't they damage the fly line where it is attached to them? Will I risk cutting my fingers? 

Every time I use something like a partridge feather for a hackle, I have to remove part of the feather fibres (the fluffy soft part) and that usually goes to waste. I wonder if that can be used for something like dubbing, for example. I know that most materials are not that expensive, but I hate to waste stuff. Are there uses for those soft fibres? In general, what by-products of tying a fly can be reused on other flies? 

When reading or watching videos on about reading water for fishing in English, I often come across terms like riffle, run, pool, seam, among others. However, when I get o the river ready to float that dry dropper over the riffle, I'm not so sure if I'm targeting the right area. I'm not even sure I perfectly understand what these terms mean. Can someone help me to make sense of these terms and of which cues should I look for when reading the water. Specifically: 1) I often read that seams are where two currents meet each other, but what should I look for? Pictures from the internet don't always look like what I see at the river. I can see that there are different currents when I have my line across more than one, but is that the only way to find seams? What are the general visual cues? 2) Pool and run (also beat) are somewhat confusing for me. They seem to refer to the same thing: a stretch of fishable river water. Yet, how do I know where the pool/run/beat starts or ends? I know that this should be at the head/tail of the pool, but what should I look for to find these? 3) I learn that riffles are faster shallow parts of the river, and I usually look for white foamy water. What is the difference between that and a rapid? Is it just a matter of semantics? It all looks like white foamy water for me. 

Go late in the day, when you've been walking around, and your feet are already sweaty and swollen. Your feet will naturally go up a size when active, and this represents your default when hiking. Boots tested in the morning with fresh feet will suddenly seem too small when you've been hiking for a few hours. Wear the socks you intend to hike with. The proper fit of your boot should take this into account. I prefer one thin sock and one thick sock (two socks will rub each other, instead of your skin, reducing the likelihood of blisters). Bring your socks to the shop with you and wear them while testing. If you forget, a good shop will usually have a few test pairs. Try out different terrain and force. The salesperson already did some of this, but many good shops will have a little artificial hill with cobbles for you to walk up and down (often like this or this). You'll get an idea for how your feet slide around inside the boots, and if you need more toe space or a different shape of boot. Try to wear a heavy load too, to get a feel for how the boots perform under a real-life scenario. If it's an outdoors shop, their rucksack section will have weights for testing the bags - borrow some, or bring your own from home (I know my local shop keeps stacks of old telephone books taped together, for exactly this purpose). Remember that the rucksack with weight will change your center of gravity, which will affect how your feet touch the ground. 

I think the best bet for a person without arms (assuming we aren't talking rough water/offshore use) is a type 2 life jacket. Specifically the type that look like an oversized bib. 

It seems to me that a canoe would be the most pleasant way to navigate/explore a swampy/boggy area. Canoes typically have a shallow draft allowing you to explore areas with minimal water depth. They will also help you avoid inadvertently falling into a hole and getting a foot/ankle/leg trapped. You will have extra space to carry more supplies, and in a pinch you could sleep in the canoe. You also have a little wall to keep swamp critters from getting too up close and personal. Of course if the area is open enough, and you have the means, you can ride in style with a fan boat.... 

Depending on how handy you are you can build your own simple jig for very little money. There are several YouTube videos that explain the basic process/jig. One I found that seems cheap, and efficient is here link. The guy demoing the rig even appears to have carbon shafts like you. The basic concepts that the videos tend to share is a fixed cutting wheel, some sort of aligning/mounting surface, and a way to measure the arrow. In the video this is accomplished by screwing a Dremel tool onto the jig's base plate. Two L-brackets are screwed onto the base plate at whatever distance is comfortable. In back of the L-brackets a cut-off yard/meter stick is glued to the base plate. Finally a block is screwed onto the base plate at the length you want to cut your arrows. To use this jig you first trim the shaft down until it is close to the size you want. Then you place the nock against the block, and slide the arrow back against the L-brackets rotating the arrow as needed to complete the cut. 

In addition to the great answer by user737012: How strong should the tippet and leader lines be? Tippet size also affects how natural your fly looks in the water. Bigger tippets are stiffer and make the movement of small flies seem unnatural. On the other hand, it is very hard to cast big flies on thin tippet because a smaller tippet will not be able to turn the fly at the end of the cast. There is a rule of thumb for deciding tippet size that stipulates that tippet size should be close to hook size divided by three. So, if you fish a fly tied on a hook size 12, the most appropriate tippet size would be 4X. Then you can go one size larger (3X) if you expect to fight bigger fish or if the water is turbulent/murky. You can also go one size smaller (5X) if the water is clear and still, or if the fish are wary. Bear in mind that this rule will not work for very big hook sizes (1/0 or above). 

The other two answers are correct. You can use plain old nylon or fluorocarbon monofilament lines and save cash (with the pitfalls mentioned by the others). Keep in mind, however, that specialised tippet brands sometimes use better materials or do fancy things to their lines like coating them with UV or abrasion resistant materials, so you may want to go for them if you want good quality. It is possible to buy large bulky spools of specialised fly fishing tippet (like Stroft, incidentally one of the best in the market) from some brands, so you still get to save money. 

In short, you're trying to emulate the real-world hiking experience as closely as possible without leaving the shop. After all, you don't want to realise you made a terrible choice when you're twenty miles from the nearest help. 

Honestly, there isn't much you can't do with a decent mid-sized fixed blade (your basic 3-4" Mora type) with a Scandi (flat) grind, and a small axe for processing firewood. With practice, you can also use the axe head for planing and shaving wood (tinder, feather sticks, etc). A 6" knife is completely overkill unless you're also hunting and gutting your own food. In my experience, a multi-tool has more design compromises than advantages for bushcraft, and I no longer carry one. Folding blades in general are also riskier, in the event you need to do something that stresses the blade, as the hinge is a potential point of failure. A lot of discussions online seem to focus on batoning with a knife, which I would strongly recommend against, in favour of either an axe, or bludgeoning wooden wedges with another piece of wood. I also used to (and still occasionally) carry a lightweight folding saw, where the blade stows inside the handle, but I also find rare use for it that can't be done with an axe. Those little chain saws that are a piece of serrated wire are little better than gimmicks. I wouldn't carry a sharpening stone for just a few days' trip, but a small stone or lapstone is handy for longer trips. This can be shared in a group. Beyond those, you could take a hardened plastic trowel for a lightweight digging tool (outdoor shops often sell these), but with your axe and knife, it's also easy enough to shape a pointy piece of wood to accomplish the same job. It mostly comes down to skill with the blades (practice) and creativity in improvising tools and solutions out in the field, rather than bringing everything and the kitchen sink with you.
