This chart suggests that the percentage of the No Religion group in the younger population is greater than in the overall population. As they get older, you would expect the overall population to more closely match what we see in the younger population now. This is the chart from 2006 but the chart from the 2013 census shows a similar pattern. 

The Car Connection points out that the book authors have used a yearly travel distance that is around half the U.S national average: 

I haven't yet been able to find whether the authors included this in their calculations or whether they used the same footprint per kilogram of meat as was used for human consumption. If the claim about meat-based pet food being primarily made up of off-cuts that would be otherwise burned is true, and the authors didn't include this in their calculations, the carbon footprint of meat-eating pets would be significantly smaller than the book claims. Phys.org also expresses some skepticism: 

This also implies that you do not have a license to practice medicine until after the two-year foundation programme which makes calling the salary you earn during this time a starting salary inaccurate. The source states directly after the starting salaries: 

The chart states a value for a salary at five years but this information is not included in the source. The value £45,000 does not appear in the source. The average of the specialty doctor range listed above is around £53k however it should be noted that we don't know the actual distribution within this range. On a different page from the same site regarding GPs, the salary range is listed as between £55,412 and £83,617. The hours on that page are listed as 50. 

The photo is an relatively obvious composite of Dutch police in the foreground and a bunker in the background and is probably not evidence of anything. 

The future is difficult to predict which is why we tend to avoid it here at Skeptics. These trends show what will happen if the forces at work do not change and the rates stay constant. Predicting for certain that the rates will stay constant until 2050 is beyond the abilities of science. 

According to CyberBunker, a Dutch Police SWAT team attempted a raid on their property but were so unsuccessful in gaining entry that staff didn't even notice the attempts until they reviewed the security footage later that afternoon. After the DDoS attacks aimed at Spamhaus last year, many stories were written about CyberBunker which repeated this claim. 

Which suggests that some trainee doctors earn more than the basic salary. If we consider this foundation programme to be training rather than a starting salary for a fully qualified doctor then it should be compared to the £20k - £30k training wage for a train driver. It is still possible that some trainee doctors may earn less than some train driver trainees in the first year of training but most doctors will be earning more by the second year, even if they do no overtime or unusual hours. It's worth noting that for the London Underground drivers, some shifts will start before 6am and some will end after 12pm. This BBC article says "as early as 04:45 and end as late as 01:30". No mention is made in the chart of the higher salaries that doctors can earn. 

You claim is contrary to the abstract of the paper. It's worth noting that the fish results changed in the follow up paper as well. 

One extra thing: I would imagine most doctors are well aware that a university degree actually has a negative value, not £0 as it costs a significant amount of money. 

There's also a conflict of interest. The author of the study sells a product that can solve the problems raised by the study: 

Your article is too long to address every piece of evidence in this format where we are limited to 30,000 characters. But there are problems even between the article and the evidence. For example, in the section on Randomized Controlled Trials on Wheat, you say: 

Directly after your claim that the trial would have found statistically significant results if it had lasted longer, you make the claim: 

A blog post by Zoë Harcombe details a long list of problems with the conclusions of this study. She doesn't raise any problems with the methodology of the study, just the conclusions that have been drawn from it. Specifically to answer your question, no protein does not increase the risk of cancer. The study only claims that it does within a certain age group and within the other age group, it is actually associated with a lower risk of cancer. Many conclusions can be drawn from the study but only the ones that make animal protein sound bad actually were, which is suspicious: 

Elsewhere, a specific value for top of the salary scale for tube drivers is listed as £49,673. ASLEF (the train driver's union) lists it as £48,133 Various sources state that London Tube drivers salaries do not change based on the time spent in the role. The chart states that doctors work "min 48" hours per week however the source document says 48 hours per week in one part and the maximum is 48 hours further down the page. 

A comment on the post mentions that three other authors of the study also work for L-Nutra. The study doesn't have any comparison to smoking but the press release from the lead author of the study does. 

As you can see, the answer "No religion" is trending upwards at around 10% per decade. Christianity is trending downwards at about the same rate. The total of the categories "No religion", "Object to answering" and "Not stated" is at around 50% of the population in New Zealand. Christianity makes up about 43% of the total population in New Zealand. If the rates stay constant, we would expect that after 36 years, the percentage of Christians in New Zealand will have dropped by 36% which would leave 8% of the population left as Christians. The same would be true for the No Religion group in the reverse direction, going up by 36% to 74%. The percentage of non-Christian religions has been growing over the last four censuses, however the rate of change is smaller than the other two groups. At about 2% per decade, by 2050 they would make up 13% of the population, outnumbering Christians. From this simple projection, they along with the "Object to answering" and "Not stated" groups would make up the remainder of the population. This is a simple projection from existing trends and is not highly likely to be precisely correct however it does suggest that the prediction of less than 10% religious by 2050 is close to what we should expect. 

[edit: As the other answer notes, this was not first made public at the debate. She has been stating this publicly since May 2016 at the latest.] This additional insult Trump repeated in public, on the Howard Stern show: “She gained about 55 pounds in a period of nine months. She was like an eating machine." It was also widely reported at the time (1997) that Trump called a press conference which Machado was forced to attend, and told reporters that she was "somebody who likes to eat". He also told the "rowdy" reporters, "A lot of you folks have weight problems. I hate to tell you." 

Yes. Actually, Microsoft has supported Linux for business consumers for some time, so this is not all that big a shift. 

I think I found the person responsible for this quote, saying something very similar a decade later. Faber-Castell is a pencil business based in Germany, owned by a single aristocratic family. Shades of grey, and other hues, put lead in pencil sales (The Australian) 

The question as you posed it was whether "lip balm" in general can make skin dryer. Lip balm can have any number of ingredients. A long list can be found here. ChapStick, the most common brand of lip balm, contains petroleum jelly/petrolatum. A textbook on the subject, Dry Skin and Moisturizers, states: "Petrolatum blocks the evaporation of water from the skin (transepidermal water loss, TEWL), thus keeping the stratum corneum well hydrated." (In other words, ChapStick is mostly the same as Vaseline, and there is nothing harmful about putting Vaseline on your lips.) A scientific study cited on that page showed petrolatum to have superior abilities at retaining moisture in the skin compared to herbal remedies like the active ingredients (?) of Burt's Bees organic lip balm. Burt's Bees provides an example active ingredient of salicylic acid. Of this, the Dry Skin and Moisturizers book states: "It should be remembered that salicylic acid preparations may be irritating and can cause systemic toxicity if applied to large areas of damaged skin." Elsewhere in the book, it's recommended to avoid giving salicylic acid to children. And there's more: 

The BBC, for their part, claims that antisemitism has not increased, and that this is a fabrication by Putin. Their main source for this is an oligarch who seized control of the Ukrainian Jewish community in 2010. 

The author is repeating an old, hoary chestnut from the days of Edward Gibbon about a sudden decline in Roman prosperity after the conversion of the Empire to Christianity. This is basically a false rumor which seemed believable in Gibbon's Age of Enlightenment, but he had to work hard to present any supporting evidence for it, including fabricating the myth of the destruction of the Library of Alexandria. In reality, the Empire was already in cultural decline after the 2nd century (for example, we know of no updates to Roman law after the Institutes of Gaius circa 170 AD), but the economy was sustained through the 5th century, leaving no room for Gibbon's theory to find success. Here's one academic analysis: 

Upon closer inspection, it seems that this story can be traced to a single, very creative conspiracy theorist writing in 2010. GULF BLUE PLAGUE: It's Not Wise to Fool Mother Nature This is a surprisingly well-written blog post that invents an extremely tenuous conspiracy from whole cloth. After explaining how Synthia was developed, the author abruptly switches to the Deepwater Horizon spill: 

(Alexis Sanderson, “The Śaiva Exegesis of Kashmir.” In Mélanges tantriques à la mémoire d’Hélène Brunner, edited by Dominic Goodall and André Padoux, Institut français d'Indologie, 2007.) It was exceedingly hard to find these texts in translation, but there you have it: two undeniably Tantric scriptures which mention sex in passing. Neither, I should caution, focus on sex. But there are plenty of books written by Indians before the 20th century and generally called "Tantric" which talk about sex in some detail, many of which are documented on the following sites: 

Here is a medical flyer explaining this health outcome in relatively simpler language, as well as discussing the risks associated with Ramadan for diabetics. Fasting in general is associated with reduced risk of cancer and better treatment of cancer, but there is little research that has looked at Ramadan in particular, as this study shows: "Ramadan Fasting and Patients with Cancer: State-of-the-Art and Future Prospects" Front. Oncol., February 2016 

Two brand-new, publicly accessible review articles confirm that this study had a sampling bias. It's basically children from low-risk, middle-class white backgrounds that exhibit higher cortisol levels in day care. Children from other backgrounds may have positive results, depending on the quality of care. Child Care and Cortisol Across Infancy and Toddlerhood: Poverty, Peers, and Developmental Timing (2016) 

Since 2010 when that study was published there has been new positive research on ADF. Maideen, Pakkir, et al."Adverse health effects associated with Islamic fasting: A literature review." Journal of Fasting and Health 5.3 (2017): 113-118. 

Alf Hiltebeitel, in his review "Introducing the Mahābhārata" (Religious Studies Review 41.4, December 2015), takes an extremely skeptical view of dating the composition. What he is forced to conclude is that there is no evidence either for or against the story existing in any form before 400 BC. That's pretty much all that can be said about the Mahābhārata from a scientific standpoint. We do not know how old or young the underlying story is. One author claims it can be dated to the 12th century BC (ibid., 166), and Hiltebeitel condemns this as baseless speculation-- it would require 800 years of oral transmission. But there is no evidence against it either. You'd simply have to acknowledge the caveat that many of the details were still being rewritten between 400 BC and 400 AD. The dates of 7300 BC and 5561 BC are wild speculation, but the general supposition is that an underlying oral narrative does exist (ibid., 155), so the limits of how far back you want to go are defined only by the size of your imagination. Generally the West doesn't admit the existence of monkey gods who can leap from India to Sri Lanka, so you might have to be courageous with your imagination as well.
