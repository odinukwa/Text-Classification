In space, you need only concern yourself with the neutrons and X-rays. Radiation Enhanced Bombs According to Atomic Rockets: Radiation Flux: 

Economic Self-sufficiency As the colony continues to grow and establishes production infrastructure the colony will begin exploring goods and services it can create that are unique or superior to those available on Earth. These might be: 

The process by which speciation occurs in a geographic region shared by both populations is called Sympatric Speciation. This is a $\text{"Real Thing"}^{TM}$. How it happens The above Wikipedia article is pretty dense. Here's a relevant snippet" 

List of candidate gases From lightest to heaviest (in my list). The greater the difference in the gases masses, the more likely you'll get differentiation. $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline \text{Gas} & \text{Atomic Mass} & \text{Type} \\ \hline \text{Hydrogen } H_2 & \text{2} & \text{Reducer} \\ \hline \text{Helium } He & \text{4} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline \text{Methane } CH_4 & \text{16} & \text{Reducer} \\ \hline \text{Ammonia } NH_3 & \text{17} & \text{Reducer} \\ \hline \text{Water } H_2O & \text{18} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline \text{Neon } Ne & \text{20} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline \text{Nitrogen } N_2 & \text{28} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline \text{Carbon Monoxide } CO & \text{28} & \text{Reducer} \\ \hline \text{Nitric Oxide } NO & \text{30} & \text{Reducer?} \\ \hline \text{Oxygen } O_2 & \text{32} & \text{Oxidizer} \\ \hline \text{Hydrogen Sulfide } H_2S & \text{34} & \text{Reducer} \\ \hline \text{Fluorine } F_2 & \text{38} & \text{Oxidizer} \\ \hline \text{Argon } Ar & \text{40} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline \text{Carbon Dioxide } CO_2 & \text{44} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline \text{Nitrous Oxide } N_2O & \text{44} & \text{Oxidizer} \\ \hline \text{Nitrogen Dioxide } NO_2 & \text{46} & \text{Oxidizer} \\ \hline \text{Sulfur Dioxide } SO_2 & \text{64} & \text{Reducer} \\ \hline \text{Chlorine } Cl_2 & \text{70} & \text{Oxidizer} \\ \hline \text{Krypton } Kr & \text{84} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline \text{Xenon } Xe & \text{131} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline \text{Bromine } Br_2 & \text{160} & \text{Oxidizer} \\ \hline \text{Iodine } I_2 & \text{254} & \text{Oxidizer} \\ \hline \end{array}$$ Light gases are dominated by reducing chemicals while heavy gases are dominated by the oxidizing chemicals (primarily the Halogens). Inert gases like $N_2$ and the noble gases are sprinkled through the mix. One Possible Setup As long as the reducing layers and oxidizing layers are separated by inert layers, you might be able to have all sorts of gases. On possible configuration would be (with the Bromine layer as the deepest layer). $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline \text{Layer} & \text{Gas} & \text{Type} \\ \hline 1 & \text{Bromine} & \text{Oxidizer} \\ \hline 2 & \text{Krypton} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline 3 & \text{Earth's Atmosphere} & \text{Oxidzer} \\ \hline 4 & \text{Helium} & \text{Inert} \\ \hline 5 & \text{Hydrogen} & \text{Reducer} \\ \hline \end{array}$$ 

Schwern's answer is the correct one for the specific question that you asked. However, there is a situation in which something similar to what you describe might be both feasible and desirable. Aldrin Cycler The problem Space is very hostile to human life - deadly radiation, zero-G, energy production, food production, oxygen production, water production. Also the general environment of space habitats leave much to be desired from a psychological perspective - living space. The reason those things pose such hurdles to space travel is the fact that every gram you take with you often costs 2 grams (or more, sometimes much more) in fuel you need to bring with you for your mission. The solution Imagine a situation in which you could bring as much mass as you wanted for your mission without it costing you anything in your fuel budget. 

Astronomical facilities and research facilities (no atmosphere, longer observation baseline) Other scientific facilities and research (novel environments) Biomedical research (novel environments) Drug research (zero gravity is good for growing large protein crystals) Specialty Electronics (zero gravity and high vacuum -> extra pure materials) Specialized high value mechanical items (e.g. zero-gravity -> perfect ball bearings) Novelty items (Moon rocks, etc. for collectors) Specialized materials (zero-gravity & high vacuum makes especially large and perfect crystal growth possible - or perhaps we'll be able to make true high-temperature superconductors or super-long nanotubes - km instead of mm in length) 

I've watched and read many SF stories which included nanites as a wonder weapon that can do pretty much anything. One such series is the Star Marine series by Ian Douglas. Those books frequently quote the nano disassemblers as able to chew through a meter or more of exotic materials in several minutes. I've always thought this was far too optimistic performance for nano-machinery. I would agree with the theoretical capabilities of these devices (manipulate materials at the molecular level, transport materials from one location to another, etc.). However, manipulating materials at this scale does not circumvent the laws of thermodynamics or geometry. From a thermodynamics perspective, they require a means of transporting instructions into the nano machines, usable energy into the system, transporting waste heat out of the system, and transporting materials out (for disassembly) or in (for assembly). One great advantage of nano machinery is its potential ability to multiply capabilities. However, geometry restricts them to acting on an expanding spherical surface or a constant area surface (e.g. burrowing a tunnel). Nano machines do not move quickly in relation to the macroscopic world. The world's first nano-machine race is expecting the machines to move 0.3 nm (0.000000003 meters) per each propulsive impulse and complete the 100 nm course in 36 hours. What are realistic numbers for nano-machine performance? 

Most things that could stop the Earth's rotation suddenly (e.g. Thea Event $URL$ ), would vaporize or liquify a significant portion of the planet. We wouldn't be around to worry about the piddly little stuff like atmosphere and hydrosphere. Other things that might cause the Earth to stop rotating would stop all the objects on the Earth from rotating too (e.g. it'd keep the oceans and atmosphere in place). 

In a highly climate controlled environment like a space ship, other than for utility purposes (pockets) and nudity taboos, there's no real need for clothing. The carefully controlled environment of the spaceship will eliminate the need to wear clothing to regulate temperature and for protection. So reprogram your generation ship crew and colonists to forget the nudity taboo and only provide them with utility belts/tactical webbing to provide the necessary pockets and other utility slots. Now you don't need to worry about making, sizing, storing, fitting, etc. the clothing and you don't need to worry about washing it either. For activities in which clothing provides some protection or comfort, a minimum set could be provided - sports bra, jock strap, etc. Activities requiring clothing for safety can of course retain their safety garb (I sure wouldn't acid spilling somewhere sensitive!).
