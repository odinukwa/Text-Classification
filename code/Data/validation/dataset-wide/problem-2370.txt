You certainly can, if the waist belt isn't high enough and tight enough. A few years ago I briefly worked at a small rock wall where among other duties I belayed and showed people how to put on a harness. In my experience most newcomers don't (want to) fit the waist belt properly, and a significant fraction of regular climbers fail here too. The waist belt needs to sit above the hips, not around the hips, and certainly not falling off the butt as some find fashionable with pants. It is not sufficient to casually tug at your harness and say "look it doesn't slide down." In a fall forces many times body-weight can occur: the padding will compress, the textiles will stretch, and your body will deform. The harness needs to hold on the pelvis not on the buttocks or other fleshy bits. Look at images of the human skeleton: the thick part of the pelvis is at the top, the iliac crest. That is where the belt should hold. If it slips (or starts) below that point only the projections of the femurs exist to catch it, and they are mobile and of insufficient dimension for the task. 

Attempting to answer the question as asked Due to the separate parts of a standard kernmantle rope twists can happen differentially between the core and sheath (kern and mantle) which can make completely straitening a badly kinked rope quite difficult compared to single-braid ropes. From my experience with shorter pieces of kernmantle cord I think tensioning the entire length of rope at once and untwisting that is a helpful complement to the pull-through method Roflo described. Since you described an overhanging rappel I would therefore bundle up all the rope that is on the ground and tie it to the hanging rope so that it is off the ground, and add any practical weight that is small enough to turn freely. The greatest twisting should be in the part that is not in the bundle as that part did not pass through the Munter. When you pull the rope what twisting remains will hopefully come out well enough. I have never done a full-length rappel on a (single) Munter so this is speculation. 

I have no direct evidence to support this, but I believe that wearing minimalistic shoes like moccasins or Vibram toe shoes reduces trail damage, as does learning to walk and run barefoot. Soft-soled shoes conform to the terrain rather than gouging in. You also learn to walk with less impact when wearing this kind of shoe. Going barefoot, even if not while actually hiking, teaches one not to twist, drag, or skid his feet as this will cause blisters. Once learned this smoother motion should carry over to hiking as well, at least in soft shoes that are conducive to the stride. 

It requires a fair amount of skill to be highly accurate with (more than I ever developed anyway) but the elastic-band slingshot meets these requirements. 

The same setup, but this time the climber exercises discipline and doesn't attempt to clip until his harness is level with the protection, but he still falls. The fall factor is slightly higher but the rope arrests the fall at 1 meter and all is well. Or is it? First you may have realized that if the red dot is the harness there should be legs (or if inverted a torso) below that point. Okay, so his feet touch but all is well? No. This didn't account for any stretch in the rope, movement of the belayer, or rope slip in the belay device. Precisely accounting for stretch would be complicated as it will be a function of the fall itself, and the other factors are even harder to pin down. However if we add only 20 percent rope stretch the climber falls another meter and decks: Scenario 1c: 

I can't help but think that this question may trolling, but here goes anyway. There is a difference between skin and skin if one includes the glans as it is mucous membrane: anything marked "for external use only" might cause unexpected irritation. Don's humorous remark about capsaicin is a good example that I'm sure more than a few men are accidentally familiar with. Since the mouth and lips are also lined with mucous membrane a lip balm with sunscreen would probably be a safer choice for that particular application. 

If there is no place to hang them up invert the system and use them as handles for a Farmer's Walk, a great exercise in itself. If this is still too much for the office you can at least give your forearms a serious pump with a heavy gripper. 

Olin's answer gives some good reasons layering pants may not seem as common. In reply: (2) There are full-side-zip pants for mountaineers (crampons) and wide-opening pants for skiers/boarders and regular boots. (3) Any time it's cold or wet I've used layers, and so did the people around me. Because a jacket is easier to put on everyone starts there when that is sufficient of course.

Clip from the most solid stance available Clip with your harness as close to the rope-end carabiner as possible Sometimes the old mantra "the leader must not fall" still applies 

As Ben Crowell already noted you are not going to be taxing a rope very much in this application, and unless you are planning acrobatic moves off of these holds (which you very well may be) there is little danger even if the rope (or cord) fails. Unless you happen to get a very good deal even 6mm accessory cord, the real UIAA certified stuff, is quite expensive, especially when viewed from the perspective of price per mass or volume. Using a thinner cord will result in you using more feet of it to form your monkey's fist than would using a thicker cord. You may actually end up paying more to use accessory cord! 

It doesn't take -20°C to form ice near waterfalls or freeze curtains of water, though perhaps it takes that to freeze fast-flowing falls entirely. See this Blog entry from which these pictures were taken: 

You are apparently confusing static and dynamic elongation. You must use rope that is UIAA-101 / EN-892 certified for the task at hand. You will be buying a Single type rope unless you specifically know otherwise. Quoting Beal Ropes: 

You could do worse than to research Wim Hof, his accomplishments, and his training methods. TEDx Amsterdam video YouTube channel Daredevils show featuring Wim Hof Have fun. :o) 

(The first bolt is omitted from this drawing as it is now inactive in the system.) Remember the extended draw effectively lowered the second bolt to 4 meters so even if the climber is patient about clipping the third bolt he still risks decking if he falls. The solution is to re-clip the second bolt with a short draw, moving the effective point back to its original 5 meters: Scenario 2c: 

The cord it wrapped over the horns in a figure-8 pattern that avoids twists. (High resolution image) The cord is fed out simply by pulling the end and allowing the card to rock freely in the hand. For cord too large to practically use a card winder of any size it can be helpful to form the cord into more than one bundle (coil), and wrap these together. This way tangles are less likely to form, and if one does it is confined to only a fraction of the total length of cord. Tangles that do not involve the ends are easier to release. 

We have one bolt at 3 meters and a second at 5 meters. The climber attempts to clip with his harness at 4 meters but falls a moment before clipping. Because additional slack was introduced the climber decks. Scenario 1b: 

The 22kN rating is for the loop strength of the sling, not the single-strand strength. Therefore any reduction in strength caused by a knot puts the strength below the 22kN standard. Stated strength for a girth hitch varies from one report to another and with the specific connection (around a large object, sling on sling, on a carabiner), knot orientation (bend angle), and sling material. I encourage you to research this, or even better if you can have your specific combination pull tested. Also, I'm not convinced the girth-hitch method is that much more convenient. This seems pretty fast: The Alpine Quick Draw - Michael Silitch [YouTube] 

One can also tie an asymmetrical Prusik without access to the end of the rope using one of these cords. As far as I know none of these are popular among rock climbers. Some people do not carry any dedicated Prusik loops, relying only on runners, but I have seen enough climbers that do. For those that are carrying Prusik loops why not a single or double eye hitch cord? I find ascending a rope with a Purcell and a waist Prusik challenging enough. If one of these arborist's hitches works just a bit better why not consider it? I think it is valuable to know that one can tie a friction hitch using the end of the rope itself (Blake's) even if this wouldn't be a typical application; it's another tool in the toolbox. Am I forgetting other critical uses for a Prusik loop that an eyed hitch cord cannot perform? Are there other practical reasons to choose a closed Prusik loop over these hitches, or is just a matter of different culture and experience? (Splicing eyes is not a typical climber skill from what I gather.) 

Avoid the problem with a better solution Avoiding the twisting in the first place surely is best, and there is a simple way to do that: 

Ideally I would like to see actual data and sources for the comparisons, not merely inferences and anecdotes. 

Ben Crowell already answered the "why minimalist" angle better than I could have, but he didn't specifically talk about Vibram FiveFingers (hereafter VFF). This is intended to complement his answer. Generic pros of minimalist footware 

A number of prominent climbing organizations (e.g. International Federation of Sport Climbing) either recommend or require two locking carabiners for clip-in attachment to a harness, e.g. 

A price of £1/meter for accessory cord is really quite high as rope goes, especially if it is 6mm. I regularly find factory-short lead ropes for that linear price and it would take a much shorter length of 9mm-11mm rope to complete your wrap than it would of accessory cord. (On the other hand the last time I bought 6mm Accessory Cord I got it for less than 20¢/foot which would make it more practical.) 

I have no special knowledge of this subject but it is my understanding that rock cut by blasting fractures deeply, beyond the part that is removed, and that as a result climbing on such rock is typically not safe as entire blocks are liable to come loose. A bolt is worse than no good if it pulls a boulder down on top of you, and trad pro, especially cams, create outward pressure on cracks and may force apart the fractured blocks even faster. Some climbing does take place on blasted faces but I believe a lot of work goes into preparation, and it still may be rather chossy so care is advised. Quoting $URL$ 

I'm not sure why pants don't receive the same attention but the layers are available. You can easily find base, insulating, and shell layers. 

Since 550 "paracord" is not a life line (unless actually used as shroud lines or similar), I think price takes precedence, assuming the cord is up to a basic standard of size and construction. If you are willing to buy in bulk you can get it for about 5¢ per foot. 

It seems that the majority of professional arborists favor friction hitches that are tied with a free cord rather than a loop: 

I believe that hard cheeses can be kept at a cool (cave-like) temperature if tended properly. I'm sure there are many more examples of traditional foodstuffs that do not require modern refrigeration. 

You should not use a toothed ascender as a fall can sever the rope. Additionally these devices are typically not usable for decent therefore additional equipment is required anyway. Section 6 of this report has testing of fall-arrest devices: Lyon Equipment Limited - Industrial rope access 

You leave behind gear sufficient to create a rappel anchor that is strong enough for any conceivable load that may be placed upon it. This is no different from any other properly constructed rappel anchor, the specifics of which vary with the placement and circumstance. The only situation I can conceive that one would have to violate this rule is in a true emergency where you lack sufficient gear to safely complete the rappel, yet if you remain you have greater risk of death by exposure, fire, etc. Since you are asking about "nuts or worse yet expensive camming devices" this does not appear to be the case you are inquiring about. You value your life more than your SLCDs I hope. The fact that you are asking this question leads me to believe that you are not sufficiently experienced with building anchors. Also, "Could cord be used as a sling ...?" leads me to believe you are not even familiar with the capability of your gear, and/or you do not know how to use it properly. Please seek professional instruction from a properly certified guide if you have any doubt. 

Here even with 20% rope stretch the belay catches the fall. But how can that help on existing bolts with no opportunities for natural protection? Here's the "trick" I mentioned at the beginning: effectively lower the position of the bolt by using an extended draw. You can reach above your head to clip the upper carabiner without putting any slack in the climbing rope, then clip the rope into the hanging carabiner at waist level. To make it even more slick you can pre-clip that carabiner to the rope and attach the rest of the extended draw to your harness with velcro; now you can grab, rip, and clip in one fluid motion. Decking averted! Well there's one more issue. Suppose the next bolt is at 7 meters. Scenario 2b: 

I propose using whatever cord is strong enough, inexpensive, and compact, then marking it with fluorescent surveyor's tape. 

Full body weight hangboard training or pull-ups are way too intense for me to build or maintain route endurance. To extend the time under tension to the length experienced on a route and to practice resting as is needed in route climbing I suggest a modification: chair pull-ups, but using the hangboard or other training holds.* Advantages: 

Finger "pulley" protection Many people tape fingers with the idea of protecting the ligament "pulleys" of the finger flexor tendons, usually following an injury. I have read in several sources that this is ineffective, at least so far as in actually supporting the ligament, because it would have to be damagingly tight to work as people suppose it does. This page, also from Chockstone.org, suggests that it may serve to limit (bad) motion or simply remind that an injury exists: Tape and Other Catastrophes If you are still curious about the finger taping methods see: Avoid Finger Blowouts 

So you see the static elongation must be no more than 10% for a Single climbing rope, yet to meet the impact force requirements the dynamic elongation is going to have to be much higher than that (though it may not exceed 40%). 

You cannot tell by simple observation if a cord is as strong as it should be. Even if the cord was originally manufactured to the correct specification it may become invisibly damaged by chemical exposure. See this report for an analysis of such a case that fortunately did not result in serious injury. Do not trust cord unless you know both its source and all intervening handling. 

In my experience nothing beats a "card winder" for ease of use and avoiding tangles in thin cord (such as kite lines). The card must be sized to the volume of cord stored on it. 

A UV-C germicidal light kills the odor-producing bacteria, so used regularly the smelly compounds never build up and your shoes don't stink. It also helps to dry your shoes after use, e.g. in front of a fan. And, as stevemarvell said, wash your feet before you climb. I assembled my own UV-C sterilizer and I can attest that it works. It uses a higher output germicidal bulb than e.g. the SteriShoe brand device, and I don't know how well those low-power ones work. Since UV-C is very dangerous make sure you know what you're doing if you choose to do something similar.
