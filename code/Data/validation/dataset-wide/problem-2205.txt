The offside rule encourages all the players to be actively involved in the game, which leads to a more entertaining game. Think about what would happen if there were no offside rule. The attacking team could then place one or two strikers close to the goal, and just wait for a long pass. Against a lone goalkeeper, it is a non-contest. To prevent this, the defending side would be forced to permanently position two or three defenders close to their goal. If both teams did this, the game reduces to a volley of long passes, which makes it very boring to watch (and play). 

This could be a "hilarious" use of the Decision Review System, but nonetheless I want to know if it is possible. Suppose both the batsmen run to the same end (mix-up, as commentators like to call it), and the fielding side puts down the wicket at one end. The on-field umpire declares one of the batsmen out. Can this batsman invoke DRS to challenge the umpire's decision, in effect, claiming that his partner should be out instead? A non-hilarious scenario would be if a top-order batsman and a tailender gets involved in the mix-up, and the tailender is given out. The fielding captain might want to invoke the DRS to try to get the more skilled batsman out instead. 

In effect, 50 overs are added to the denominator of the loser's "scored" run rate, while their "conceded" run rate is unaffected. The winner's run rate is unaffected. This is easier to understand with an example. Suppose Team A doesn't show up for their game against Team B. Then for purpose of calculating net run rate, following data is considered from this game. Team A (loser) 

When a batsman's shoelaces come undone, he usually asks a fielder (or umpire) to tie them. Why do they do that instead of doing it by themselves? I would imagine it doesn't save any time. In fact, it would likely take more time unless the fielder is standing in a close-in position. 

Quite often, a fielder near the boundary dives to try to stop the ball, and in the process pushes the boundary rope further away. I have never seen the boundary rope being restored to its original position. This will put the batting side at a disadvantage. If the batsman plays another shot to the same place, the ball has to cover longer distance. Nowadays, it is also a common sight for a fielder to take spectacular catches close to the boundary, so that little push to the boundary rope can make a drastic difference. Nobody seems to care about this issue, even the commentators don't consider it worth mentioning. What is the reason for ignoring this issue? 

The idea is to make it difficult for the opponent to regain possession by confusing them. A normal shot makes the trajectory of the ball easily predictable, increasing the chances of losing possession. If the opponent doesn't know which way the player will kick the ball, it is hard for them to react to it quickly. You are correct in saying that this shot is "unstable" as compared to the conventional shots. However, players do not play these shots on a whim, they practice these thoroughly before executing them in the real game. With thorough practice, they can make the shot less "unstable". Obviously, that does not mean they can never fail, but with sufficient practice, they reduce the chances of that happening. 

I suspect that you are talking about the Ultra Edge used as part of the DRS. That is used only in case of LBW or Caught forms of dismissal. In case of LBW, if the ball has hit the bat before hitting the pad, he is not out right away, and they can avoid the ball tracker altogether. In case of Caught, well, it is quite obvious why they want to check for the edge. Umpires don't check for edges in case of Bowled decisions, because if the wicket is down by a fair delivery, batsman is bowled, regardless of whether it hit the bat or the batsman's body along the way. (By the way, according to Brad Haddin, it is also okay if the wicketkeeper gently helps the ball onto the stumps when the fielding side really needs the wicket. ;-) ) 

The ICC World Twenty20 2016 Playing Conditions also includes the same rule, the difference being, of course, that instead of 50 overs, 20 overs will be added to the loser's "scored" run rate denominator. Such forfeiture has occurred a few times in Cricket World Cups: 

Suppose 3rd innings of a Test match is in progress. The batting side has piled on a heap of runs. The fielding side has little success in getting wickets and they are only hoping for a declaration to put them out of their misery. But then, the captain has a "bright idea" to save the game: simply refuse to chase the ball! The two batsmen can keep running to their heart's content, but they batting side cannot do a declaration while the ball is not dead! The fielding side would probably be asked to part with some of their match fees for slow over rate, but it doesn't affect the result of the game. Are there any specific provisions in the law to prohibit this? 

If the ball strikes the striker's person, any runs scored are credited as leg bye extras provided that the striker was either attempting a shot or trying to avoid getting hurt. For balls whose trajectory would clearly miss the stumps (hence, LBW doesn't apply), the batsman can line up his bat alongside his leg, and then kick the ball while moving the bat in sync with the leg. This makes it appear he was attempting a bat-pad shot, making him "eligible" to score leg byes while eliminating any possibility of getting out caught. There could be other "creative" ways of faking a shot while deliberately hitting it with the leg, as well. Is this kind of misuse allowed, and if not, what is the provision in the laws against it? 

I just found out that the idea of clouds and overcast conditions assisting swing is essentially an Urban Legend, and also the result of Confirmation Bias. As NASA scientist, Dr Rabindra Mehta, who has studied the aerodynamics of cricket balls for three decades, remarks here: 

A defender following a raider into the opposite court is called Pursuit. Defenders cannot pursue when they feel like it, there are some rules to be followed. Link to General Rules of Play:
