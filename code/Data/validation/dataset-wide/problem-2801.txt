The answer key (on p 220) states (b) as the only answer. But is this correct? I am conjecturing that a) is incorrect because they can be performed by humans and so are Phenomenal. Why is c) not also an answer? The following quote appears to justify c):

I know almost no philosophy so please simplify all feedback. While I understand this Analysis for the example, I still don't understand the general, but deeper reasons for the possible failure of transitivity for material conditionals? I rewrite the Analysis here just with the letters: 

Why is the answer definitively 1? almost's function is ambiguous; it can assure (if the skeptic believes: 'almost everyone' means a sufficiently higher number), or it can guard (if the skeptic believes: 'almost everyone' means 'far fewer than 'everyone') . Also, does the italicised part of the prof's answer contradict his choice of 1 as the answer?

What exactly are the IFs? Which if-clause(s) does Nagel reference? How is 1 true? How do the If-clauses differ from ? 

Recently I saw Heinz's dilemma and actually I found that none of the actions or purposes is really wrong or right to me. But I found that punishing (e.g. imprisoning) Heinz (in the case he steals the drug) would be wrong to me. Although my ethics do not answer whether he is wrong, various theories do (some can say it will lead to good consequences, therefore he does right action, and some can say it is violation of duty). But I hardly can understand what these theories suggest to do with those whith peoplr who were "right" or "wrong". Therefore I'm wondering now if the question of punishment (and reward) lies within ethics. If so, what is the ethics branch studying it? 

Depends on the definition of labour. There, indeed, are people who like some kind of non-intellectual labour. There are people who don't like it. Intellectual labour is - arts, science and philosophy. Yes, mere translation of algorithm from human language to programming language is not really intellectual. But development of new algorithms is intellectual labour. Of course, the word emancipate means those who don't want X, won't need to do it in order to fulfill their desires. So, why have I started to talk about intellectual labour? As you may think, among those people who do intellectual labour, much higher percentage do it because they want to do it, as opposed to those who do physical labour. Latter majorly do it only to have money, which on their turn, allows people to fulfill their desires. If they were not be in need for money, they would not do it. While artists, scientists and philosophers still would exist and do arts, science and philosophy. This means that non-intellectual labour is majorly seen as undesirable and should be automated. People strived for this, and do it now. Of course, large corporations, as I see it, do it partially because it allows to get money faster. But that does not negate the fact that people want to get more by spending less. So, there are a few prognoses possible. Prognosis 1. Automation reaches the threshold when further automation is unprofitable for large companies, from the position of currency. So, automation stops. And no emancipation from labour. Prognosis 2. This prognosis is really pessimistic one. As we know, money have only instrumental value. When there are only a little money, their value is survival and purchase of some desirable goods and services. But when there are a lot of money, their value turns to hard power. Power itself already can be seen by some people as having intrisic value. And then those people would prefer to have robots and other devices, while depriving others. Just because it allows having more power, which is seen as having intrisic value. But as I said, it is pessimistic one, if really many people see power as intrisically valuable and not merely instrumentally. Prognosis 3. As I said in prognosis 1, there is a threshold when further automation is unprofitable. In the optimistic case people will change current social structure by better one. By current I mean the one that offers only money as stimulus for labour (and automation itself is labour). By better I mean one that is better suited for it's purpose - emancipation from labour. In either case, it won't be capitalistic anymore. 

I'm a mere beginner to philosophy and here, I'm not asking about philosophy or any abstraction about, but rather just the logic or strength of the argument for this essay topic: 'Does it matter if some animal and plant species die out?' 

Because the question reveals nothing about whether and are true and/or false, do we only assume the most general possibility: that both and are true or false? But how does this help to conclude anything about and ? 

I bolded the only change. Why is it wrong to translate 1 as 2 below? I pursue only intuition; please do not answer with formal proofs or Truth Tables.

I'm self-learning philosophy, but am untrained in linguistics, and fear obscurantism. So I prefer and find more helpful 'paraphrases': (which I define to mean) other philosophers' rewrites and glosses, of the originals, in enjoyable plain simple 20th-21st century English (or French). Should I read the paraphrases before the original philosophical works? I assume: 1. that the author is a fair, learned philosopher, who genuinely tries to explain and simplify the original work, dispassionately and objectively. 2. the availability of (cheap!) such paraphrases. 3. the important worth in reading the originals, but dearth of time prevents reading both the original and paraphrase. 

The statement would be false if he said "The outcome can only be 1 or 2." Would it be lying even in this case? Well, being wrong does not mean lie. Lying implies that the liar himself does not believe in his own words. The person who is wrong because of unawareness or unintended errors (fallacies, acceptance of wrong premises, etc.) is not lying. According to Cambridge Dictionary 'lie' is: 

The analogy from real life: Let's say you have simulated a world in the computer. If you are tracking what happens there it already is changing you. Because that generates new memories in you thus changing your mind. If you're just watching, it is interaction in our world, but as I said may be not the case outside of it. Conscious changes indeed require some kind of tracking thus if you are consciously changing that world, you (as mind) are changing. And many faiths (probably all) declare that god[s] is/are conscious. 

There are many disasters that would take humanity "off-line" and machines surely can help mitigate or totally prevent them. 

So, when we say to a child not to touch hot object, even if their will is to touch it, we refer to future will: the child will be hurt by it and the result of that will be undesirable, which means that future will of the child will be not to touch hot object. So, we take into account the future will when say someone not to do something sometimes. But is there any estabilished term denoting both present and future will? I am asking that because I am wondering if the ethics/morals taking into the account both present and future will can be named "will consequentialism". Or another wording for will generalized to the whole time continuum could be named "sense" but I am unsure about it as well. 

Because both paragraphs above discuss the same CP, should they cohere with each other 100%? If not, does each logically imply the other? I am confused if the differences cannot be conciliated. To me, the two quoted paragraphs appear different because (from p 437) assuming the antecedent of the required conditional statement differs from (p 446) assuming the negation of the conclusion (this last bolded phrase says nothing about CS). To wit, an IP's conclusion may NOT be a CS.. In fact, the example referenced in p 446's conclusion is ~A, which is NOT a CS. 

p. 239 states footnote 29 to refer to: Thomas Nagel, “Death,” in Moral Questions, 6. Why's the bold sentence true? I assume that the injured whiz prefers her intelligence. The injury bars her from pinpointing the moment of misfortune, but an objective observer (e.g. physician) can? 

I understand why Anselm's Ontological Argument is unsound from other websites, but I understand not: 8. 5. If , why can't we ? 9. 6. Why is there 'nothing further you can do'?

This depends on the definition of sanity. There surely are people who would incessantly use drugs or will just be so bored that they'd commit a suicide. But majority of people wants automation not for these purposes. I don't see any problems why should automation be banned. 

Therefore, there was some kind of popular moral philosophy at those times. Probably it is not different from currently popular moral philosophy, but has anyone made an effort to show what was morally popular? If so, what were them? I am interested in particularly pre-Kantian moral philosophy, because it was the first (accepted by academics) formulated in our era. Previous accepted by academics moral philosophy is virtue ethics, but it was kinda forgotten by the time when Kant lived. 

Freedom is a language construct. It is used for conviction. E.g. when some social groups say their freedom is violated, it means they are dissatisfied with current status and want something to be changed. Of course, in order to be more persuasive, they ought to use thick moral concepts. One of such concepts is freedom. Therefore, what really freedom is varies on context pretty well. Sometimes it can mean your first definition, sometimes second. Sometimes it can even mean omnipotence and omniscience. Now answering on your other questions, one by one. 

Thus, theism posits that god[s] is/are affecting our world by their actions. We may consider that those actions are not responces to what is happening in our world. In other words, those actions are independent on our world. This means that either god[s] is/are deterministic or all their actions in our world are occasional. If we accept that those actions are responces to what is happening in our world, we must accept that these actions are parts of interactions between our world and god[s].

I comprehend that to prove an argument containing only Conditional Statements (as all its premises and conclusions), you must assume separately some antecedent, because otherwise, with what else can you start the proof? In despite of my comprehension above, I am still troubled by the bolded sentence above: Why do CP and IP succeed where DM fails? After all, any method is operating on the same premises and conclusions; so it seems strange that CP and IP can abstract something more from the same argument than DM can. 

Why should the red y instead be x (per the above answer)? I wrote the red y because the green restrictive relative clause modifies bison2, and not bison1. 

I do not understand the difficulty in deducing 2 from 1; so what have I neglected? 2 is really a Conclusion from 1, if we add the following Hidden Premises:

Based on 1, can't I argue symmetrically, and oppositely, that: "when the absence of pleasure involves no deprivation for anybody,", the important question is also whether this absence of pleasure is 'not good' or 'good'?
