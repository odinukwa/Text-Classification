Stop right there. Language is easy to learn. Children do it as easy as breathing. Kids can even learn multiple languages at once without breaking a sweat. It is just when we become adults it becomes hard. A simpler language makes for a simpler, less capable mind. We really don't want to do that to our children. Your only valid point is 

The problem with the slow alternative is that somebody else will do it the quick way and colonize the heck out the planet before you get there. 

This was originally posted to the Puzzling SE, which means that the poster has a specific answer in mind. Since they chose the odd value "65 million years" instead of a round number, it is probable that the intended answer is: You should cause the Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event. 

Internal politics. There was a period where the politicians made bigger and bigger messes and the voters grew more and more impatient with them. It seemed like everybody was corrupt. A new party called the Openness Party appears. They have a charismatic leader and win votes with a simple promise: "No more secrets!" It starts as a local party and wins the mayor's seat in a city. And they deliver. As the months go the city administration becomes more and more open. A number of corrupt city employees are discovered and punished. A major pollution problem is stopped when BigCorp can no longer bribe people to look the other way. The city budget improves as politicians can no longer attend "meetings" in faraway luxury resorts. The Parking Authority's private golf course is opened to the public. Riding a storm of public approval the Openness Party enters national politics and wins again. After a few years almost every aspect of the government is open to inspection by the media or by anybody who cares to do so. There are very few remaining secrets, all of them military in nature. When they meet foreign diplomats, of course they will invite media. Why not? 

And frankly, I think a big part of making it work was that the Romans did not care very much about religious doctrine, so they were willing to be flexible. The Romans could shift from Jupiter as a philandering husband who would turn his girlfriends into animals or trees to hide them from his wife, to Jupiter as an icon of perfect justice, without missing a beat. Christians and Muslims have resisted saying that Jehovah and Allah are just two names for the same God because they both have very detailed, specific ideas about their Gods that are incompatible, and neither is willing to just toss them out. 

Well, of course the premise of the question is that a "post-scarcity" society is possible. That is, that it is possible to create a society where everyone can get whatever they want whenever they want without having to work for it. It is difficult to see how that is possible in the real world. I recall lots of science fiction stories written in the 1940s and 1950s, when automation and productivity were really taking off, that toyed with the question of what people would do with their lives when you could get everything you wanted with little or no work. But here we are 50 or 60 years later and no one is wondering how to fill their time because everyone is so rich that they don't need to work. Sure, today we spend a lower percentage of our incomes on food then people did 200 years ago. But besides that ... Maybe it's true that you could get a small, simple house that would provide basic shelter from the weather for a smaller percentage of your income than it took 200 years ago. But people don't want a minimal house; they want a big, fancy house. Today cell phones and computers are considered almost basic necessities -- to the point that people talk about the "need" for governments to provide these things to the poor for free -- yet they didn't even exist 200 years ago. If technology continues to advance, the average person will be able to obtain better and more, but it is likely that people's demands and expectations will also increase. So in the Federation people get their food from replicators. Who builds the replicators? Who maintains them? Who mines the ore and smelts the metal that these replicators are made from? Etc. If they're not paid, why do they do this work? If the replicators break down and the person who maintains them doesn't feel like working today because he'd rather go fishing, it seems to me that people would starve. Should we assume that there would always be someone who knows how to repair them and who feels like working today? How could we be sure that that would happen? If everyone gets everything they want for free, wouldn't large numbers of people decide that they're not going to work at all, and never learn any of the skills needed to keep the society working? I recall years ago when I was in high school, one of my teachers "explained" to the class that the idea that people in a utopian communist society would not work is false. He'd still work, he said, because he gets satisfaction from working. And maybe he would. Most days. But if you knew that you would get everything you wanted whether you worked or not, that work had nothing to do with any personal reward, don't you think there would be days when you'd say, "Hey, I don't feel like working today, I think I'll hate out at the beach or just take a nap"? I'm sure I would. I'm sure the amount of work done would be more than zero, because some number of people would work just because they enjoy the work or are bored sitting around doing nothing. But a whole lot less work would be done than when people are rewarded for their work. Why do the crew of the Enterprise take orders from Captain Kirk or Captain Picard? If they're not paid and they have no obligations, then any time the captain orders them to do something they don't feel like doing, why don't they just say "screw you" and do as they please? He could put a black mark on their record and kick them out of Star Fleet? So what? If people can get literally whatever they want, then they could just get their own starship and go exploring themselves if that's what they want to do. If there are SOME things that are available for free, like food and simple clothing, but others that are scarce, like star ships, then this society must have some way of deciding who gets the scarce things. If it is not done using money or some equivalent, the only other alternative I see is that some sort of government decides. i.e. instead of people working to get what they want, they have to lobby politicians and appease bureaucrats to get what they want. Personally, I'd rather live in a society where I know that I can get what I want if I just work hard enough, or if it's really big, get together with other people to pool our resources; then in a society ruled by a communist government where the only way to get what you want is to have the right connections. But that's an opinion. You could, I suppose, speculate that human nature will change and people will want to work for the satisfaction or because they feel an obligation to society or whatever. But that's a pretty wild speculation. Read some ancient books written thousands of years ago. Has human nature changed since the earliest recorded writings? People have always wanted to listen to good music, eat good food, have friends, make love, etc etc. Human nature hasn't changed in thousands of years. There's no reason to believe it will change in the next couple of hundred. 

Yes! (Though they're not very efficient yet.) Here's a recent review paper on 'non-thermal conversion nuclear batteries', which aim to directly convert ionizing radiation into electric power. Accordingly, present conversion efficiency in lab is about 2%, but this paper says numbers as high as 10% are hopefully feasible. In the case of Sr90, this 10% efficiency would work out to roughly 70mW/g of fissile material, making the whole assembly roughly on par with alkaline batteries (double As) in terms of power per weight. The paper claims that nuclear batteries will last much longer than traditional batteries and wind up saving money because they won't need replacing. This concept isn't new. An old colleague told me about a project from back in the 60s trying to accomplish the same thing. We're further along now, but not yet by leaps and bounds. Regardless, long-lasting nuclear batteries could make for a great mechanic in a near future story. 

G. K. Chesterton once wrote, "When you break the big laws, you do not get liberty; you do not even get anarchy. You get the small laws." What he meant was, it would be great if we could have a society where people lived by broad general principles, like "love your neighbor" and "be fair in your business dealings" and "never do anyone harm unjustly". But in real life, we always see that sooner or later someone breaks these laws, and when challenged, he pleads that the law was vague. What does it mean to be "fair"? He didn't think it was unfair to not bring up the fact that that "new" car he sold really has an engine with 100,000 miles on it, and the other person didn't ask. What's does it mean to be "unjust"? Oh, you think it means I can only punch someone if it's in self-defense? But that guy over there said I'm allowed to punch someone if he insults my wife. I thought it meant I can punch someone if I don't like his face. Etc. We could argue endlessly about what is "just" and "fair" and so on. And so for rules to be enforceable in practice, they have to be specific. That is, people think that by taking advantage of loopholes they are gaining freedom. Others often warn that if people get away with such loopholes, they are not creating freedom, but anarchy. But Chesterton replies that you get neither. What you inevitably get is a mass of very specific rules to plug every loophole that someone can think of. In theory, you could have a legal system where we went entirely by the spirit of the law rather than the letter. The law could just say, "don't cheat", "don't steal", etc. But then someone would have to decide in every specific case whether the spirit of the law was being met or not. Presumably a judge or a jury or some other group invented for this purpose. But that instantly creates two problems. The more extreme is, what if the judge (or whomever) is biased or corrupt? What if, say, the judge is a racist and so in any dispute between a white person and a black person he always assumes that the black person is at fault? Etc, I'm sure you can think of many other examples. You could have an appeals process, of course, but ultimately that just means that what matters is the biases of the higher court rather than the lower court. But even barring that, assuming all judges are fair and honest, you have the problem that no one could ever be quite sure what the law is. Like, the law says that a manufacturer cannot build a car that is "unsafe". But what is "unsafe"? No manufacturer could guarantee that no one will ever be injured in one of their cars no matter what the nature of an accident or failure. So what is "safe enough"? Do we have to have airbags, or are seat belts good enough? Is it good enough if the car can sustain a 20 mph hour collision? Or does it have to be 25 mph, or 30, or 27, or 26 1/2, or what? If courts respected precedent, than over time case law would build up and people could say, oh, here was this case 5 years ago similar to mine and here's how the court ruled, etc. But ultimately that would mean that you'd have a whole bunch of detailed rules, and you're back where you started from. Of course all of this happens to a certain extent with our present legal system here in the U.S., and I presume in other countries. Even with specific laws, there are always cases that no one thought of when the law was written, extenuating circumstances, etc. To an extent, the system DOES apply a spirit-of-the-law test. Prosecutors regularly exercise what is called "prosecutorial discretion", which means that sometimes, even though someone is clearly guilty of breaking the law, they don't bring charges against him or bring lesser charges because his behavior was understandable given the circumstances, or because he has already suffered enough, etc. In short, I think the answer is, Barring some radical change in human nature, there's no way a system could be either purely spirit of the law or purely letter of the law. It's always going to be some mix, with legislators trying to make laws as specific as they can and judges and prosecutors trying to apply them fairly. Which reminds me of an article I read years ago by a judge. At the time, Congress had passed a law with "mandatory sentencing guidelines". People had complained that judges had too much discretion, that one judge might impose 20 years in jail for some crime and the same day another judge in another court would impose probation for the same crime. So to make justice more fair and even-handed, Congress passed a law detailing specific penalties for specific crimes. I don't have any of the details off the top of my head, but just to make up an example, if you stole something worth \$500 you might get 1 year in jail while if you stole \$1000 you'd get 3 years, and if you used a gun that would automatically add 2 years, etc. Judges and lawyers protested that while this sounded fair, it took away the judge's discretion to consider the details of the circumstances. Someone who started a fight after months of harassment and abuse and provocation would get the same penalty as someone who started a fight for kicks, etc. So, did the new law make justice more even-handed, regardless of one's view on the fairness? No, this judge said. What really happened was that now the judge and the prosecutor would sit down and discuss what penalty this defendant really deserved. Then they'd take out the charts from this law and figure out exactly what crime or crimes to charge him with to get the "right" penalty. If, say, including the illegal firearms charge would give a penalty that they thought too harsh, then they just wouldn't bring that up in court. If the obvious crime had a penalty that was too small, then they'd think of other crimes they could charge him with. Toss in "criminal trespass" or "menacing" or some other vaguely-defined crime. Etc. 

Well, There are four ways. One way would be a plane like the 'vomit comet'. It would slowly climb and then dip into freefall, giving you a minute of low G. Planes in 4 G would be pretty expensive, mind, but if the atmosphere were thick enough they should be possible. You can get longer times with a vertical launching rocket, like Blue Origin's New Shepard, but rockets in 4g with all that atmosphere would be even more tricky. Another way would be to sink/dig halfway to the core of the planet. The gravity should be about 1g down there. Of course if the planet has a molten core this may not be advisable :), and regardless the shafts heading down would need scads of airlocks to prevent the air pressure down there from being too high. If you happen to like the idea, I'd be happy to run the numbers. You could put the thing that needs low gravity physically in water to give it the buoyancy effect, but having it in an underwater city filled with air sadly wouldn't do. And finally, do what we do and go to orbit! Best of luck with your water world. 

I heard a story on a news magazine a while ago -- can't find a transcript so I can't give the exact quotes -- but they said that a study had found that almost 30% of people who were infected with an STD got it from a partner who had no visible signs of the disease. The panelists talked about how scary this was, how hard it was to protect yourself, etc. Then one panelist said that he thought that the really scary part was that over 70% of people who were infected with an STD got it from a partner who DID show visible signs of the disease. And then they apparently went ahead and had sex anyway. So even if there was a 100% reliable test, apparently lots of people wouldn't bother to use it, or would ignore the results. The more difficult it is to use, the more expensive, the more trouble it is to get, etc, the fewer would use it. And let's face it, how many people in a moment of passion are going to say, "Wait, before you finish taking off your clothes, let me run down to the drug store and get an STD test kit. I'll be right back. Wait right there." 

I've definitely been in your shoes. It turns out the question you're trying to answer is an inexorably difficult one, but there is a couple ways we can approach it with simple formulas.. Why is it difficult? As you already mentioned, heat transfer is complicated. It involves conduction, forced and free convection and thermal radiation all applying in 3 dimensions with complex surfaces and an enormous range of non-constant material properties. It's a mess except in the most simple of cases. Here let's look at 2 simple cases: heating something fast enough that it doesn't have time to lose heat to the surroundings, and splatting heat just onto the surface of a thing like a laser would. Here if your mages are trying to ignite something, they're trying to focus enough heat into a small enough space. Only one point needs to become hot enough to ignite (250C-ish) and the rest will burn from there. Despite having much less energy, a tiny spark is better at igniting things than an oven. The necessary temperature to ignite something is called the autoignition temperature, and can often be found through google searches. So your mages should be able to apply a certain amount of heating power into a certain volume (smaller = better) over a given length of time. Let's look at some first order equations to help shape our understanding. Here let's assume they're applying heat in a cylinder shape with a diameter+length we determine because it's a nice shape for the focus of a magic heat-beam and convenient mathematically. Also, your mage would need to hold their heat-beam steady for the duration of the time, or the heat would spread out too much. Heating the Inside Time to Ignition = (Autoignition Temp - Room Temp) * (Specific Heat * Density * (pi/4) * diameter^2 * length) / Power(magic) units conventionally in C, cm, g, J and W. Let's look at igniting paper: Time to Ignition = (230C - 30 C) * (1.34 J/gK * 0.8 g/cm^3 * (3.14/4) * 1cm^2 * 2cm) / 500W = 1.3s The actual length of time is easily tuneable by making the mages more powerful, or focusing their beams tighter or broader. To me, 1.3s sounds like a nice amount of time to make a character wonder if it's working or not. As a reference, 500W can heat a cup of coffee to boiling in a few minutes. Microwaves are often 1000W. Also, this formula completely ignores heat conducting away, which is fair enough for these power levels and the accuracy we're aiming for. An alternative, and the last stop on the trip to way too much information, is heating the material at its surface rather than in the body. This approach would require less power but be more complicated. Heating the Surface Time to Ignition = ((Autoignition Temp - Room Temp) * Thermal Conductivity * diameter^2 / Power(magic) )^2 * (pi/4)^3 / Thermal Diffusivity units this time traditionally in W, m, K, s. Example for wood: Time to Ignition = ((230C - 30C) * 1.26 W/mK * .01^2 m^2 / 5W)^2 * (3.14/4)^3 / (1.1*10^-5m^2/s) = 1.1s Notice in this analysis the pyromancer is 100 times less powerful than before (Now 5W), but still able to heat things enough to burn, like a high power laser pointer. That's because we're not heating a large volume, just the surface. This formula is much more prone to inaccuracy though, as it doesn't account for convection or multidimensional heat flow. I'd probably multiply it by 5 or 10 in practice, and don't trust any times over a couple seconds from this equation. I hope that helps. Best of luck with your world! 

I assume you mean, "using only water presently on the Earth". If we can import unlimited amounts of water, then of course the answer is "yes". No one knows exactly how much water is underground, but estimates are that it's a very small amount compared to the amount in the oceans. I came across some numbers years ago, (quoting from my own book here, is that cheating?) 97% of the world's water is in the oceans, 2% in ice caps and glaciers, 1% underground, 0.02% in fresh water rivers and lakes. So as others have said, melting the ice gaps and bringing up all the underground water wouldn't increase the level of the oceans very much, not enough to cover all the land. On the other hand, I think the common theory among creationists today is that before Noah's Flood the Earth was more nearly spherical, i.e. the mountains weren't as high nor the ocean trenches as deep. If you think about it for a moment, if the Earth was a perfect sphere, it wouldn't take very much water at all to cover it (relatively, any way). Do the arithmetic and if the Earth was a perfect sphere, the amount of water in the oceans today would cover it to a depth of 1.7 miles. So the (logically) easiest scenario to flood the Earth is: level the mountains and fill in the ocean trenches. If the highest mountains and the deepest trenches were about 1/4 what they are today, the entire world would be under water. 

There's two ways to increase your density, but both are exorbitantly expensive and probably wouldn't make you bullet proof. By living on a diet of food made with heavy but stable rare isotopes of the normal atoms, you might be able boost your density by as much as 20%! It would be laughably expensive, and probably wouldn't make you bullet proof though. Then again, I don't suppose anyone's actually tried yet! These heavy elements would include things like using Deuterium in the place of Hydrogen, using Oxygen-18 in the place of Oxygen-16 and so on. As an item of note, these isotopes do exhibit slightly different chemistry from normal, so some minor-to-moderate physiological maladies may result in a real world example. After that, you could probably boost density by an additional 20%-40% by having the person eat many kilograms of Gold nanoparticles. Eukaryotic (eg. people) cells can soak up relatively huge amounts of these little particles without having problems. Since the particles are mostly absorbed through phagocytosis (the same mechanism our white blood cells use to eat and kill bacteria), the main health risk would be increasing the white blood cells' mass too much relative to the rest of the blood and body. Other cells will absorb them as well, but to a lesser degree. Again, I don't think these would make you bullet proof, but they would make you heavy! Perhaps a futuristic flexible body-armor would be a more functional alternative? In any case, best of luck with your world. 

I might point out that this would be more of a return to historical norms than a new phenomenon. Before driver's licenses were invented, young people were just about as mobile as their parents, not particularly more or less. A young person was just as capable of walking or riding an animal somewhere as his parents were. Parents might tell a young person that he's not allowed to go somewhere alone, but the only limit was really what was imposed by parents, and not things like an inability to drive or legally get a license. I don't know what the cultural norms were back then. I don't suppose that parents let a 5 year old wander around without supervision. But how about a 15 year old? When I was a boy, people who were not old enough to drive routinely rode bicycles everywhere. My parents only drove me if I was going somewhere that was impractical to reach on a bicycle, which was rare. I regularly rode a bike to school, to the library, to stores, to friends' houses, etc. I haven't been following the development of self-driving cars that closely, but from casual news stories I've read, there appears to have been remarkable progress in the last few years. I think it's a pretty safe prediction that they'll be practical for routine use within as little as a few years, though probably not as soon as the more optimistic predictions. People are always saying that some new technology will be everywhere in just 3 or 4 or 5 years, when it's really still decades away. But we'll see. I'd guess it will take longer for them to be legal throughout the U.S. and Europe than proponents assume. People with something to lose economically, like taxi drivers and cities with mass transit systems, will fight them tooth and nail. There will be studies proving they're dangerous, protests, and court cases. Some cities or states will ban them. Like California refused to allow plastic plumbing pipe until 2002, decades after the rest of the country was using it routinely, citing "safety concerns" but everyone knew the real reason was that plumbers fought it because it made plumbing work too cheap and easy. Or see the present opposition to Uber. Etc. You also have to consider the cost of a self-driving car. I just found a study that estimates it will add $7,000 to $10,000 to the cost of a car. And of course it will be a while before there are a significant number of used self-driving car available for the cost conscious. So initially, self-driving cars will be limited to upper-income folks. To an extent a family could share a self-driving car, of course. I presume there would be some mechanism that mom or dad could drive the car to work, than have it drive itself home to take the kids somewhere. But there are limits to that. It can't be in two places at once. And plenty of parents would say no, the car has to stay with me in case I need it in an emergency. Some families could afford to buy one or more additional cars for their kids, but many could not. Presumably there will be self-driving taxi services. As you don't have to pay a driver, these would ultimately be cheaper than human-driven taxi services. But the cost of the service would still have to recoup depreciation on the car, operating expenses, insurance, and all the other costs that go into running a business. Very few families are willing to routinely pay for taxis to shuttle their kids around today. Perhaps with self-driving cars the cost would go down and thus the numbers would go up, but it doesn't follow that this would become common practice. Consider how many parents today won't let their kids walk or take a bike somewhere. Would they be more willing to let the child make the trip alone in a self-driving car? Maybe it would be perceived as safer. Maybe not. I've seen news stories about parents getting into trouble with children's services agencies for letting their kids walk to a park by themselves. It's quite possible that social pressure or actual laws would make it illegal or otherwise unacceptable to send children under some age anywhere by self-driving car. Personally, I couldn't imagine putting a 5 year old in a self-driving car and sending him off on a 100 mile trip by himself. I'd be terrified of all sorts of real and imagined dangers. 

By the time the Moon is far enough away to be invisible to the naked eye, it wouldn't be orbiting the Earth anymore. That could also be exciting, though :) Brightness reduces with the inverse square of distance, and brightness magnitude (wiki link: see the 'Examples' table) is measured on a special log scale. Put together, we get: r/r0 = 2.5^(BrightnessMagnitudeChange/2) where r/r0 is the relative increase in distance. As an example, if it's 2, that would mean the Moon would be twice as far away as it is now. Calculating Full Moon invisible at day r/r0 = 61 times farther away = 2.5^((-4--13)/2) Full Moon invisible at night r/r0 = 6031 times farther away = 2.5^((6--13)/2) The Moon would start to get dragged away from Earth by Solar gravity at an r/r0 of about (roughly) 2.5, which doesn't allow for a huge amount of change in brightness. Search 'Earth SOI' for more. The r/r0 of 61 (invisible at day) puts the Moon about a third of the way to Mars. At this point the distance to the sun would start to dim it as well. Meanwhile that 6031 value for invisible at night is right out there! But of course you could always change its albedo (Paint it Black!)
