Lime-green arrow: Chainstay mount are inexpensive but not that stable - although better than rear-axle. They look much like the rear-axle mounts. The most important thing to match is the diameter of your chainstay (the horizontal bar that my limegreen arrow is pointing to) and the clamp of the mount. However, in your case you have a rear disc brake and you need to make sure your chainstay mount won't interfere with the brake cable (the brake cable should be able to pass over your kickstand mount bracket without problem, but a particularly thick mounting bracket might interfer). Better chainstay kickstands also mount to the seat stay as that provides more leverage against the kickstand torquing or rotating on just the chainstay or bending the chainstay under weight. Note this design also allows a passthru for the rear disc brake cable. However, there are more fit issues if you have nonstandard chainstays or seatstays or rear triangle design, which can lead to complications if you have rear suspension for example. 

If your company participates or could be encouraged to participate in WageWorks (a commercial commuting-cost management company), one of the optional packages is bicycling commuting costs. WageWorks handles the pre-tax deduction and reimbursements. Eligible expenses of up to $20/month include: 

tl;dr It'd be so much easier for you to get a 29" hub motor wheel -- or to keep the current wheel and go mid-drive. Not an answer to your question about left-hand sprockets so feel free to ignore. 

Note that you can control a servo ESC through your arduino. You just need the arduino servo library. I refer to this after talking about the servo tester because it's less fault tolerant (and you still need to find a pot-throttle). You don't want your throttle control to fail-closed - that is, to fail in a way that leaves you at full throttle. With arduino or any CPU-control, this is a possibility, so you should have an immediate battery cut-off switch that uses a different cut-off mechanism (I.e., a contactor to your main battery) near your controls.

The adjustable cup can be adjusted with an adjustable wrench or regular open-wrench set. If they are too thick and you don't want to take off your crank arm, you might need to get a cone wrench. And while you can tighten the lock ring with the screwdriver tip, I find that this has a tendency to cause damage to the lock ring. One of the joys of doing your own work is accumulating cool new toys.. err.. tools. So I'd splurge and get the proper tool. Cone wrenches are pretty cheap. The lock ring wrench is a little more expensive. Here is the cheapo version, XLC Adjustable Bottom Bracket Spanner ($5-8): XLC Adjustable Bottom Bracket Spanner2 Your local bike shop can provide you with options and make sure you get the right wrenches or you can shop at a discount bike parts shop. There are very good tips on how to adjust your bottom bracket at Sheldon Brown's site: $URL$ 

Most mountain bikes have 135mm rear frame spacing, so you can go from a 8 to 11 speed cassette. Unfortunately, your 8-speed wheel hub is likely not compatible with an 11-speed cassette. -- Note: this incompatibility may just be for road bikes. So you'll need to get: 

The locking lever controls which valve is active by the direction it's turned to. When you insert the presta or schrader valve in the right hole, the valve body itself hits a small lever on the side that closes or opens the appropriate pump head valve. Sometimes this is actuated by the closing of the locking lever. Inserting the head of the tire valve trips a lever deep inside at the bottom of the valve hole. 

And of course if you have a carbon frame or seatpost, you MUST HAVE a torque wrench. Since torque wrenches are so cheap (20-40 euro-dollars for a beam-type), it's worth having them in your toolset -- or borrowing them from a local bike coop, for those times they are required. 

Did you mix old ball bearings with new ones? Or mix balls from the left side to the rear? Uneven wear in the ball bearings can cause this. This is why best practice is to just replace all of the bearings from new ones that come from the same batch/box. They’re so cheap it’s not good to recycle them anyway. 

If you have a forgiving spouse (or they are out of town), then you can run it through your dishwasher. Be sure to run an empty load after it and also get rid of any incriminating spider parts that might be stuck in the output filter. Pro-tip: Only dishwash parts that don't have any bearings in them. The problem isn't (just) washing the grease out of the bearings, it's that the grease will transfer to other parts of the dishwasher and can be hard to take off or otherwise explain to your spouse. 

I've ridden a recumbent a few times and noticed that going uphill is very, very slow. Given that recumbents are supposed to be more efficient than diamond frame bicycles, why are they so darn slow uphill? Related: does "efficiency" mean something different when applied to recumbents? 

If your bicycle is a BSO (bicycle shaped object sold at discount mass retailers), then likely no. You'd spend $100+ labor on the derailleur and a new chain, but then the next week the brakes would fail, the handlebar would come off, or the frame would crack. BSOs are money pits. Furthermore, it's unlikely you could just replace the derailleur, you'd have to also buy new shift levers or brifters, depending on what you're replacing it with. If the derailleur ate the chain, then it's likely that the derailleur hanger will also be bent or misaligned. I'd use the return policy of the store to return the bike. It was clearly misassembled. If your son's bike was a quality used bike (like a late 1980s hardtail Specialized Rockhoppper) then it's likely that the "bones" are good and that upgrading some components would be worth your while. A better derailleur would lead to faster and smoother shifts. But you'd still run into the problem that by the time you get new derailleurs and shifters, you might have spent enough to buy a used 2000s Trek mountainbike. There's plenty of life in the older hardtails and many people prefer them to the newfangled things. 

If you have an indexed thumb shifter, then these are known to have lubrication problems and will eventually freeze up in the way that you mention (shifting up doesn't work, it feels like the cable is disconnected). The simple fix for this is to shoot some WD-40 or other light lubricant into the thumb shifter body and to work it in while shifting up and down. If you can, taking off the top of the housing will work better. This is only a partial fix as eventually the lubricant will stiffen again. You can then do an overhaul of the shifter, or just get a new one from your local bike shop. There are numerous intertubes videos on how to do this, just youtube "[name of shifter] DIY fix" The simple fix for housing freeze is to try to use an injection of WD-40 (water-displacing formula #40) into the cable housing to expel all of the water and leave a thin film of very light lubricant. I would try to do this when it is warm (or your bike is inside the house) to give yourself the maximum chance of expelling the water. They sell cable lubrication widgets to put on your WD-40 straw, but I find it's sufficient to take the housing nipple off, aim the straw at the raw cable, spray, and then work the shift lever in and out -- keep repeating until you're either tired or there's some lubricant coming out the other end of the cable. This is very messy. Do not wear your favorite shirt and lay down newspaper or cardboard over your spouse's favorite rug before doing this. If that doesn't work, then I would unhook your front derailleur from the shifting cable and leave it overnight to "freeze." In the morning, I would dry shift the cable and see if it is moving properly. I would also pull and push on the front derailleur shifting mechanism to see if that is also moving correctly. This is step #3 since steps #1 and #2 doesn't require unhooking, hooking up, and readjusting your front derailleur. a. If it is the cable that is stiff, I'd replace it since the WD-40 in the first step didn't work. Replacing derailleur cable is relatively easy, the hardest bit is measuring the housing and cutting it to the exact length without leaving burrs. Your bike shop can do this for you. b. If it is the derailleur that seems 'frozen' then it requires a good cleaning and lubrication. There's numerous instructionals on the intertubes on how to do this. 

I use ShoeGoo or Sugru (you can Google both brand names) for waterproofing connectors. The advantage of both is that they are flexible and waterproof, but also relatively easy to remove in the field without any gooey residue (which tape tends to leave). I also find it hard to use shrinkwrap to waterproof connections where the diameter of the two parts is more than 1:2 in ratio, because of the limitations of the shrinkwrap shrinkage. Nail polish becomes very brittle very quickly. For the dyno connector, I'd use ShoeGoo. Assemble the connector. Put just a very small (lentil pea) size on your fingertip and rub it in like caulking compound on the outside of all mating surfaces. You want to get into all the cracks but you don't want to apply too much and weld things together. . This ensures that you'll be able to still take it apart in the field. The one exception is where the wires enter the connector body. I might put some ShoeGoo on the outside of the wire before sliding it fully into the connector to ensure that it's well sealed. As Daniel Hicks has mentioned, some dielectric grease on the bare wires will help. You can get a tiny squeeze tube at the checkout counter of the auto parts store for under $2. 

Are you trying to block rain or are you trying to be aerodynamic? For rain, a front fairing doesn't do much unless you can get one where you can tuck your head behind while also going fast enough that the rain blows over you. In Japan, I've ridden mom bikes with fairings and can say that they do zilch for rain until you're going at least 20kph or higher. For aerodynamics, fairings can also act like a sail which can lead to considerable instability. One significantly nice thing on a recumbent is that the fairing will prevent you from eating bugs. Since you're more upright, there is a tendency to consume more than on a road bike where you are facing downwards. If you're planning on an extended trip at high speed (such as a cross-country run) it might be worth it, but otherwise you may find them to be a net disadvantage. Only one way to know though -- try it! 

tl;dr: In reality, people are in either: Camp A) ignore the chain gunk and rarely clean their chains; or Camp B) get obsessive about cleaning their chains and get all sorts of accoutrements to do so. Since you seem to not enjoy cleaning your chain, I'd just stick with Camp A, ignore the chain, and just replace your chain and cogs when time comes. Getting a chain guard means you won't have to look at your chain and won't worry. 

However, when you fill it inside the tire, don't worry - there's enough stretch in it so that it will expand to the right size and work properly. The same goes for patches. If you fill the patched inner with air outside of a tire, the patches will deform the tube, but it'll still work just fine once in the tire. 

Of course, it's really easy for you to add your own rear hub motor to an existing 3x10 MTB if you really want one. But the cheaper vendors are going 1x to save money and the expensive vendors are using bottom bracket motors which aren't FD compatible. 

It's as easy as removing the front shifter, shifter cabling, front derailleur, and changing your crankset from a double to a single. If you have a brifter, you can remove the derailleur cable and figure out some way to keep the brifter from flopping (jb weld, etc) if you don't want to replace it with a brake lever. The major expense will be getting a single crankset. (Depending on your crankset spider and desired front gear, you may be able to keep your old crankset as described in comments below.) Tools you'll need aside from the usual allen wrenches and screw drivers will be a crankset puller and pedal wrench. Note the weight savings are minimal. You'd save more weight by not having a cheeseburger for lunch.
