My best answer I can give is to realize why you are there. Your employer pays you in exchange for your services. In this case, following his plans and designing/writing programs for clients. If your boss says the code does not have to be sent through review either by you or anyone else, then I suggest you listen to him. If you truly can not abide by his/her directions, you can a.) voice your opinions or b.) leave the company. Some advice though, you will be faced with many situations where you do not agree with the methods but you are still expected to "fall in line", especially in the software industry. Lastly, your boss is the mediator between you and the clients in a way and realize that he/she might have a much better perspective on the clients and businesses needs 

I can not speak to a solution outside of the workplace, because it is different. To be honest, some people you meet in life are just plain a**holes and looking to feel superior over someone. You are a soft spoken (when unprovoked), small, woman and this can be seen as a target for those people. I can tell you in my workplace, you would be a welcome addition. And so it greatly depends on the culture of your company. But, I do not suggest to pretend to be someone you are not. I'll play devils advocate and say that IF you try to go against your character, those same people will call you "fake" and the "b" word. These people are unprofessional and a**holes and you should treat them as such. Do not take that from anyone. Absolutely stand your ground when you are confident in your ideas, endeavors etc. Challenge people on their ideas when appropriate. The person who is the most quiet is the one I usually listen to when stuff goes sideways because they are calm and collected, as you are. Understand that this is most likely a company culture issue, and not a YOU issue. As always, escalate any further problems to your boss if it starts to really affect you. Good luck! 

Here is the situation. I was Working on a sales job about 5 months ago and I landed a huge client for our company and so we received a big contract from them. I approached my boss about a raise because of this contract and because I had another job offer (and based on past performance) and I received a significant raise in my salary. Today, I have received a job offer from a company that pays 15% more, better benefits, new environment, new experiences, etc, and I am excited about it. However, I also really like my current job. The manager made it known that my first raise came with some strings. One of which was my next raise won't be for 12 months. I didn't think this was all that fair but I understood. This was not in any contract but verbal. And so I am stuck on how to approach my boss about this. I am not asking what I should do. I already know I am going to approach him and let it him know that I have another offer. I am unsure how to put this across. He made it known I would not get another raise for 12 months when I received my first raise, but I think it is wise to at least bring it up to him. Some clarity: If my current company matched the job offer, I would stay. If they came close to it, I would stay. If they don't move at all and are firm on the 12 month deadline, I'll leave. My question: How do I bring this up to my employer in the best way without burning bridges? I'm afraid that even if he does match it, he won't trust me because I could be seen as constantly looking to leave. And second, he might see this as me using leverage for a second time to get a higher salary. EDIT: The big contract is the one I currently work on everyday. Unfortunately if I left, they would not renew (im the only one at our company who knows their finances left and right). I wish this was not the case but it is. My employer knows this as well, which makes it feel like blackmail. Yes I could train someone in the financial aspect, but this is a large client with relationships I have developed and they would easily move on to someone else. Thank you 

I am in a very similar situation as you so I believe I can offer some advice and share how I view this problem. As far as being the only programmer in the company, you are effectively irreplaceable as long as you do a good job (sounds like you are). This means many things such as job security, raises, freedom, etc. This does not come as easy in a big company. But, you are clearly not worried about this... you are worried about the transfer of knowledge, in other words, will my skills be desired if I wanted to move to another company? From my own experience, working for a small company has great perks and some downsides as well. I have expressed to my current management that I would like another person on staff to learn from or a mentor of such. I also lack code reviews, system audits, conversations, etc.. While this definitely isn't ideal, I feel as if I have to try even harder (and thus learn more) because I don't have that other person to bounce ideas off of and critique me. My solution: I read a lot, I read answers and questions from people on stack overflow, info security, blogs, and thoroughly read best practices from people much smarter than me. I promise you, if you continue to do this, you will wield a lot more knowledge than your average big company programmer. You will have a lot more experience with every tool or piece of software you write because you had to research it, design it, code it, test it and even try and break it all by yourself. Not many people get to do that daily...
