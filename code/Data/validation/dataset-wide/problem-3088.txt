This is not a noble writing to the first among his equals. This is a noble writing to his royal master. And what is crucial - Pliny does not feel any awkwardness over the fact. He is writing with the easy grace of a born courtier, and so we must conclude that the final acquiescence to monarchy must have occured at least a generation before Pliny himself. While we do not have such candid and clear evidence for earlier reigns (perhaps then the veil of republican or quasi-republican fiction has not yet worn so thin), there are other bits of circumstantial evidence that can be adduced. For example, Svetonius tells us that Augustus took pains to maintain a fiction of elections for various magistracies: 

In other words, Spain fell into a sort of Dutch Disease (the ironies of history). Of course, this is also true for American silver and gold - this matter was touched on in the post you mentioned. With bullion flowing from the colonies, Spain had little incentive to develop its industry and commerce and to create a solid and healthy taxable base. 

This was no trifle - it was the main demand of the newly-formed democratic opposition movement and Gorbachev's giving in to it was a clear indication that the party's grip on power was effectively broken. Indeed, the very same bill which abolished the party's monopoly on power introduced the new office of President of the USSR, to be filled by Gorbachev who urgently needed a new job title. Clearly, being merely Secretary General of the CPSU was no longer enough to command full obedience. The referendum question: another look If you will now reread the referendum question, you'll find that it does not mention the CPSU or communism at all! Rather, it reads: 

After WW2, the German currency (The Reichsmark) took a large hit in value, both due to losing the war, and the Soviets continuing to print RMs (precisely to prevent the economic recovery of Germany). The Western Governments, to facilitate the recovery of (Western) Germany introduced the Deutsche Mark (DM), which the Soviets disapproved of, banning the use of the DM in the eastern sector, while introducing their own new currency for their sector. Due to Berlin's status as an enclave within the Soviet zone, the Western Allies did not initially introduce the DM to Berlin, seeking a agreement with the Soviets. As the Soviets were against the new currency in general, they refused, and decided to introduce their new currency to their sector, including Berlin. This led to the West introducing the DM to their sectors of Berlin The introduction of the DM to Berlin was what precipitated the Blockade, and one of the goals of the Soviets was to force West Berlin to adopt the Eastern Currency. By forcing the West Berliners to purchase food from the east, the Soviets would have insured that the only currency they could use was theirs. Due to the success of the Airlift, this was never required of West Berlin, which kept the DM over the East Mark. The precipitating reason for the blockade is on page 18 of Miller's To Save a City.

I have always presumed this to be the case. They have a similar form: two chambers, the lower representing "all the people" and the upper representing, very roughly speaking, "institutional forces" (in the British case it used to be the Church and the aristocracy, in the American case it's the states). The electoral system and the procedures are largely similar. It also stands to reason that the American Founding Fathers, being well-acquainted with the British political tradition, would have emulated it, adding what they surely perceived as improvements. And, as far as I know, Britain was the only European country to even have a proper parliament in the 18th century. But this is all surmise and conjecture, no matter how sensible. Is there documentary evidence that Congress is a conscious imitation of/improvement upon Parliament? 

I wonder why? Did he get too old to perform the allegiance switch trick one more time? Did he genuinely tire of politics (not likely, null hypothesis)? Was he compromised in the eyes of the new regime by some special bad turn he had done them? Something else I am missing? 

Still, I think it is not obvious that this term should have become the title of the whole book. Or am I missing something obvious here? 

As a professional should, Dykstra also warns from committing the fallacy of small numbers. I also found in a Texan blog an example, apparently drawn from the first-mentioned paper: 

Authenticity The memorandum, titled "Reflection on the Treatment of Peoples of Alien Races in the East", is certainly genuine. Though if I understand correctly, what we have is not the memorandum (said to be 6 pages long) itself, but rather Himmler's own summary of it and his further notes to self on dissemination. These notes were entered as Document No-1880, Prosecution Exhibit 1314 at the Nurenberg military tribunal. There is a full English translation available on a number of websites. E.g. here. Apparently, Generalplan Ost was based on the ideas raised by Himmler in his memorandum. Significance 

Hindu Festivals and Regional Diversity Elsewhere, everything I find shows incredible diversity. Here and there, but not in sources that seem to be particularly well researched, there is talk of Saturday as a weekly holy day, and some claim this corresponds to the traditional "oil bath" in parts of southern India, which could take many hours - something you can read about in Ashtanga yoga as well. However, I didn't find much in the way of detail. Instead you find a lot of passages like this from Caleb Wright in 1853: 

Zolberg argues that the references to immigration in the declaration probably is referring to the disallowance of a North Carolina act of 1771 and an Order in Council of 1773 preventing migration into recently-French territory (p25). However, Zolberg points out, they were also angry at the crown for the opposite: British efforts to prevent the colonials from barring "undesirables" such as convicts and paupers, or limitations on the slave trade (p26). On the other hand, there was equal enthusiasm for excluding Catholics for the most part (p37). Zolberg summarizing the main differences among colonials and the British thus: 

As one might expect, it is a tricky business to talk generally about practices on the Indian subcontinent. For most things that is as true today as it is for the subcontinent of centuries ago. The diversity of religions, cultures, languages, and the complex political realities over the centuries means that this answer really must be more of a sampling of the variety of practices. Below I offer a sampling of what I have found on the practice of rest days in Indian Buddhism, Zoroastrianism, Jewish Indians, Hindu festivals, possibly regional rest days, and conclude with possible emergence of greater standardization with British colonial rule. Uposatha and the Claim of Earliest Rest Days The closest I came to something pointing to a very ancient origin is in an article by Bruce A. Kimball. I think this quote is also important because it points to the connection between feast days, taboos surrounding them, and rest days: 

I think I found the source of this theory. Google scholar has turned up this 1930 book: From Orpheus to Paul a History of Orphism. One recent publication that cites it is a 2008 thesis of Stian Sundell Torjussen from the University of TROMSÃ˜. I'll quote a passage from p.40 there: 

EDIT 2: Come to think of, I ran a search on the Perseus website (it's great we have it!) and it turns out Thucydides did use the term once: 

It seems that there were a number of attempts during WW1 to design either personal armour for infantrymen or heavier contraptions known as "creeper tanks". I guess they were discarded because of either insufficient protective capacity or unwieldiness (or both). $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

A possible explanation is that he simply received the name of the saint on whose day he was baptized. That would be 11 April in this case. Wikipedia says he traveled to the mission on September 24 and was baptized "soon". Can "soon" refer to a six-month period? I don't know. Or maybe the fathers at the mission just had a soft spot for St. Stanislaw for some private reason. 

China was worse. I recall an episode from Wild Swans where the narrtor's mother had to confess her sins before revolutionary students during the Cultural Revolution. This was done while standing on her knees for half an hour - while the floor was strewn with shard of broken glass. 

Great question - but it is actually a complicated subject. The polytheistic society of the Roman Empire was, so to say, in active search for "the meaning of life" for which the standard pagan cults were not sufficient. This led to philosophical/intellectual movements like Neoplatonism which while not explicitly rejecting paganism and the Olympic gods more or less supplanted them by a notion of a Supreme Being. And this was just one movement among many (others have mentioned Epicureanism, for instance), coming as they always do in higbrow, middlebrow and lowbrow versions (the later Neoplatonism became heavily involved with "magic" and astrology). The Church was later to tap with great success into this potential for religious yearning and transformation. Like I said, it's a huge subject and one that I am not an expert about so I'll stop here. I've learnt a lot about it from this book but I guess it's a bit outdated. One day I'll find the time to read this one which is waiting for me on the shelf. 

Those are Service Ribbons, which denote which medals a soldier has been awarded without having the medals themselves displayed on their uniform. Yours appears to be from a British or Commonwealth soldier during World War 2. Your ribbons are from a Polish Soldier operating under British Commonwealth Command in Italy during World War 2, possibly as part of the II Corps (found by extrapolating from your username). The medals these represent (that I have found are), 

During WW2, submarines on patrol were out of contact with friendly forces for extended periods of time. Even when operating in a Wolf-Pack, they generally couldn't tell exactly where their pack-mates were or how they were doing. While they could broadcast their status using their radios, this was limited to avoid radio intercepts and direction finding giving away their presence in an area. This meant that more often than not, the first indication that a boat was lost was either a boat missing a radio check-in or the boat being overdue on returning to port (an example of this is the Wahoo). However, without confirmation of the boat actually being lost, they would still be marked as On Patrol. Removing the boat would be admitting the boat, and its crew, were gone. Leaving it as On Patrol turned into a mark a of respect for those lost, and the tradition stuck. 

I am not certain of the fifth ribbon's identity, but it seems to match, and it is possible that it could have been awarded after September 8th when Italy signed the armistice and joined the Allies. 

I wonder - do we know who these men were? Can they be identified with known victims of later emperors? 

However, FDR was the Democratic vice-presidential candidate himself in 1920! (wiki) Isn't there something of a contradiction here? Perhaps FDR was supporting a Hoover run before he decided to run himself? Am I engaging in an anachronism here? 

The reference here is to the forced repatriation of Soviet POWs, forced labourers, and Ã©migrÃ©s after WWII. There is scattered information about it in wiki here. However, the number 6.5 million seems a gross overestimate (2 million - which also is surely a huge number! - is the likelier figure). I also don't quite understand why France is mentioned there. Perhaps he is referring to the fact that returning French prisoners faced some opprobrium and shaming, though nothing like the harsh treatment given by the Soviet state to its returning prisoners. But I doubt that any significant number of French prisoners had to be coerced into returning to France at all, as in the Soviet case. 

Howard Roark explains why the Parthenon is not great architecture and in passing explains that the whole of architectural history has been nothing but a series of copycatting: 

A further look at the map that kubanczyk posted indicates another part of the story: the original campaign objective was indeed Moscow. However, Charles had to halt at about Smolensk (the last major stop on the eastbound route to Moscow) and to give up the idea of marching on to Moscow because his supply train (led by General Lewenhaupt) couldn't make the rendevouz with the main army on time. Plan B was turning to summer quarters in Ukraine, which was supposed to be rich (true) and friendly (false).
