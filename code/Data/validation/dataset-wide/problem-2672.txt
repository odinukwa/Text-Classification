One is tempted to read corruption as sexually fallen, but is this the correct meaning(s) of the word here? For example, in modern medical terminology could it mean mentally ill? Perhaps it covers both of these - or more. Drug addition, bad parenting etc. Is perhaps moral corruption the best view? Is this justified by a closer look at the semantic values of the word in Sanskrit that has been translated by the word corruption. What are the views of the standard commentaries in classical and modern ie Aurobindo and Radhakrishnan. EDIT In The Bhagavad Gita & its message Aurobindo writes: 

and this together with either reflexivity or symmetry implies transitivity. This idea has broadened into the idea of isomorphism in modern algebra with the work of Emmy Noether, and underlined by the Bourbaki school which took a strong line on this - one could term it Structuralism in mathematics, which has a broad sympathy with a parallel movement in the humanities also called Structuralism, prominent in linguistics (by Sassaure) and in Anthropology (by Levi-Strauss), but did not directly influence each other. In mathematics this current deepened into category theory, where one is not allowed to assert that two things are actually equal, but only that they are isomorphic. This is typified by what are known as universal properties which defines an object upto isomorphism. A good definition in category theory is one that is satisfied by some kind of universal property. That this add something fundamentally to mathematics, is seen by the fact, that multiplication (products) are dual to addition (coproduct), a discovery in basic mathematics (with the usual notion of basic) that had not been discerned before. But there is more, two objects may not only be isomorphic, they may be isomorphic in more than one way, in which case we get higher order isomorphisms. This is the beginning of higher category theory. This may also be interpretable as proofs between types: for example, we may have two different proofs that two types are isomorphic, and then a proof that two proofs are in fact equivalent. This interpretation also allows ideas of homotopy theory in where we consider the 'shape' or 'topology' that all these proofs make (metaphorically, if one visualises a proof as a string of assertions, with one following another; the question is can we deform one string f proofs into another). This is the beginning of higher toposes. In a different direction, Liebniz in philosophical investgation into indiscernables said that, uncontroversially, if two things are equal, then all predicates satisfied by the first must also be satisfied by the second; and controversially, if both objects satisfies the same set of predicates, then they must be the same object.

The planet is a big place, there is a tremendous amount investment in the current energy regime; there is also a political, economic & social cost associated with both preventative and adaptive technology. Victoria Finlay mentions that the Sikhs measure time in periods of three hundred years - the last one being that of the Sword which came to a close recently; the next three hundred years is dedicated to the environment - its on these kinds of time-scales that these kinds of forces operates, which is one reason that they remain invisible (apart from media reporting). 

Smoking is generally understood have many ill effects. One can say one is punished for smoking. But this does not stop many people from smoking. There are penalties for criminal activity but this does not deter criminals. 

The etymology of the word universe comes from the Latin words uni, meaning one, and versus, meaning turn and is attested from Late Middle English. It suggests that the universe is 'mortal', having a lifetime, from a beginning to an end - an epoch. This contrasts with the Indian conception where the universe is eternal, and when one epoch (yuga) ends, another begins. One may also want to contrast this with the notion of the Multiverse (which though recently fashionable goes back to Atomists who following a principle of plenitude, posited something of a like kind and one might also wish to contrast this principle with, in one sense its opposite, the principle of parsinomy - Occams Razor) which has many causally & spatially disconnected parts, each of which is called a universe. However, a natural definition of the universe is everything that has been, is, and will ever be. This, appears at first glance, to subsume that of the multiverse, as each part - each universe, is a thing, and has been, is or will be. But one notices that each universe would have it own time coordinate, and one could be justified in claiming that this definition of a universe names only that part of the multiverse we have already christened as a universe. What is the best definition of a universe and multiverse? 

Can one say, at least roughly, that Set Theory attempts to ground itself on Platonic Realism, which states that universals exists. And that Category/Topos Theory attempts to ground itself on nominalism? That grounding of Set Theory on Platonic Realism appears to be a failure for the reasons I've given above: In that the only universal it contains is the empty set, and that it doesn't provide us with the universal example of the number 3? That the attempt to ground the the uniqueness that should be inherent in the realist position on universals, at least in set theory, is/was understood to be captured by the axiom of extensionality. One notices in particular that the uniqueness of the empty set is essentially reliant on this axiom. Does Category/Topos Theory capture the nominalist position - or are there failures here? One notes that the theory speaks of 'universal properties' which has a precise technical definition, and one notes that they do not produce a unique object but simply characterises those objects that have those properties - and show, as one should readily note, that any two such objects, so far as these properties are under consideration, are equivalent. 

New concepts in mathematical logic would include, say, Topos theory; that demonstrates Cohens forcing technique as a species of geometry. 

I don't have a particular take on this ethical dilemma through an established ethical framework; however I think it is interesting that you are comparing two kinds of reporting, one scientific and objective and the other, the human record by way of newspaper reports and photographs. Scientific reporting, by its form, is designed to remove the human element and make it bearable; in the same way that surgeons find cutting into human flesh bearable by their training; whereas newspaper reports are designed to bring to presence the moral, instinctive horror were face to face with it for the first time. Your reactions are consonant with that. 

The programme of ultrfinitism dispenses with the notion of very large finite numbers simply becaause they argue that such large finite numbers have no way of being conceptualised in our universe in a constructive manner. As far as I can gather, the programme hasn't developed a sufficiently precise theory. This obviously is inconsistent with the existence of the natural numbers as we usually know them. Are there other theories of arithmetic that are inconsistent with the arithemetic as encodedin the Peano Axioms? 

I do not mean that there are philosophical positions on the theory of mind (as there most certainly are), but that philosophising must be part of the theory of mind, with a natural 'osmotic' unwilled component (which would have a genealogical willed process), and a willed component. How far one takes that willed component distinguishes what we would then ordinarily call philosophers to those that aren't. The relationship I'm hinting at is that of the concious mind to that of the unconcious. But not the same. One of the reasons I'm asking this is that I believe that all men/women are philosophers, but I want to distinguish this from the activities of professional philosophers, academic or otherwise. So I'm proposing a notion of a natural unwilled philosophical activity. Edit What do I mean by unwilled philosophy? That it's not under conscious will, but that it's unconsciously willed. (I do not make the claim that all his philosophising is unwilled, only that a part is). But if this unwilled philosophising is in his unconscious then we cannot get 'thinking about'. This can only mean that his unwilled philosophising can happen in the conscious mind. I'm not positing a constant force of will here, but in fits and starts, strengthening & weakening, in this direction or that direction. Our consciously willed philosophising must also occur in the concious mind. Ergo, they can interact. I'm holding that for most people that both willed & unwilled philosophising weakens and dies, but in professional philosophers & students of philosophy the willed philosophising carries on for longer What do I mean by a genealogical willed process? I'm also considering, in part, is how a mind develops over an evolutionary period of time. It's clear we have minds, it is not unreasonable to posit that say a fox doesn't; over my evolutionary (genealogical) history at some point I'm related to something like a fox. I'm trying, in part, to understand how that can happen. I want to relate the naive conception of will referred to above to that of Schopenhauers. But maybe thats best saved for a different question.
