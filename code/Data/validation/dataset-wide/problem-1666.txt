Antioxidants are often touted as some kind of miracle cure for all kinds of illnesses. They are supposed to prevent damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the cells by scavenging those ROS before they can cause any damage. The link between antioxidants and cancer seems plausible at first glance, ROS can react with DNA and cause mutations through that mechanism. The accumulation of certain mutations can lead to the development of cancer, so the idea that preventing the damage caused by ROS to the DNA by consuming antioxidants could prevent cancer seems plausible. Is there any hard evidence that consuming antioxidants can prevent the development of cancer? 

One aspect of the latest reveal of the US budget for intelligence agencies that has been reported in the media is the alleged budget for a program to break encryption. From an Ars Technica article on the subject: 

The relatively new drug for Hepatitis C, Sovaldi, has caused a rather large controversy about the appropriate price for medication. This NY Times article is one example of the controversy, citing the cost at $1,000 a pill, and $84,000 for a complete treatment. I'm not asking about what price is appropriate, this is a much more complicated debate and entirely off-topic here. But I am interested in putting the price in context, and the official statement from Gilead paints a rather different picture than most of the articles in the press I read. They state in their policy position: 

A recent meta review (mentioned in some articles in the media, e.g. The Telegraph or CBS News) examining the association between abortion and mental health problems "Abortion and mental health: quantitative synthesis and analysis of research published 1995–2009" by Priscilla K. Coleman in the British Journal of Psychiatry claims 

Acupuncture is based on the belief that diseases are caused by blockages of your qi, which flows in so-called meridians in your body. By sticking needles into those meridians you can manipulate the flow of qi and eliminate the blockages. The concepts of qi and meridians are unscientific, they date back to a time where there was no scientific method and knowledge of human anatomy was practically nonexistant. There is no evidence that qi and meridians exist at all. Sticking needles into your body still could have some effect, although it will have nothing to do with your qi. There are tons of clinical studies about acupuncture, but few conclusive results. A major problem is that controlling for the placebo effect is complicated, as people usually notice whether you stick needles into them or not. Some of the newer and better clinical trials used fake acupuncture needles that do not penetrate the skin. Another often used method is to stick the needles outside of the "proper" acupuncture points as a control. Acupuncture is believed to be helpful in a large variety of conditions, I'll take pain relief as an example as it is somewhat plausible that sticking needles into your skin could have an effect on the perception of pain. A review from 2009 in BJ concludes: 

The European Food Safety Authority investigated the health impact of casomorphins in their report "Review of the potential health impact of β-casomorphins and related peptides". β-casomorphins can act on opioid receptors, but their effect is much weaker than that of your own opioids or opioid drugs: 

There are multiple reasons why animal studies would fail to correctly predict the result of specific drug candidates in humans. There could be fundamental differences in the biology between e.g. mice and humans in the specific parts affected by the disease and the drug candidate. But there are also some indications that the problem is in part due to flaws in the animal studies themselves. The paper "Can Animal Models of Disease Reliably Inform Human Studies?" published in PLOS Medicine states: 

The article cites the revenue data for the drugs, but that can be misleading as the drugs are not all equally priced. It seems hard to believe that antipsychotics are more often used than statins considering the frequent reports of an obesity epidemic. Are the revenue numbers due to a vast increase in prescription of antipsychotics, or are there other factors at play like e.g. generics that push down the price of certain drugs and decrease the total revenue? Is there evidence that antipsychotics are widely prescribed unnecessarily like the article implies? 

A search in the Pubmed database for "soursop cancer" (which is automatically expanded to , so it will not only show exact matches) shows 43 results, though none of those are trials in humans. One of those results is an article titled "Complementary therapies, herbs, and other OTC agents.", in the abstract it states 

There is also strong evidence that the withdrawal in the UK lead to a reduced number of deaths. The article "Effect of withdrawal of co-proxamol on prescribing and deaths from drug poisoning in England and Wales: time series analysis" published in 2009 in BMJ states as a result: 

Not too long ago a story about a study examining mummies for the prevalence of cancer caused a flurry of articles in the media claiming that cancer is a man-made disease. The researchers claim that cancer was very rare in ancient egypt compared to modern times. In their press release about the study the author states 

There are no obvious ways to resist those effects, they are based on the fundamental chemistry of living organisms as we know them. 

It is known that many animals posess the ability to sense magnetic fields (magnetoreception), a well-known example are migratory birds. Humans are generally considered to lack such a mechanism. From the article "A behavioral perspective on the biophysics of the light-dependent magnetic compass: a link between directional and spatial perception?": 

It is true that bacteria can't become resistant to ethanol to our current knowledge, but the cited reason doesn't sound plausible to me. According to "Epidemiologic background of hand hygiene and evaluation of the most important agents for scrubs and rubs." published in Clinical Microbiology Reviews in 2004: 

The whole report is mixing a lot of stuff up, making it very confusing to understand what is actually claimed. I'll go ahead with the claim that they developed a car that can run on water as a fuel. To make it short, basic thermodynamics tell us that water cannot be a fuel in the way described in that report. If you pay attention to the video, he says that he uses "water and electricity", using electrolysis to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen gas, and then burning this gas mixture which results in water again. So you start from water and end up with water again. Energy is conserved, you can neither create it nor destroy it, so going from water back to water cannot provide you with any energy out of the water. Where the energy that actually drives the car from is the electricity used to split the water into hydrogen and oxygen. A hydrogen/oxygen gas mixture contains a lot more energy than water, and this energy is released when you burn the mixture, the end result is water. But to get from water to hydrogen/oxygen gas you have to put more energy into it than you'll get out in the end. 

The contents of this report are also nicely summarized in the article "How the EPA linked "fracking" to contaminated well water" from Scott K. Johnson at Ars Technica. 

The number of diagnosed cases of autism has increased substantially in the last decades as seen in the following graph. 

You can detect any RNA by transcribing it to DNA using a reverse transcriptase enzyme and subsequently performing a PCR reaction (polymerase chain reaction) to amplify this DNA. This is called reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Those are very basic techniques that are known for quite a while now and there is no reason why they should not work on HIV. And PCR-based tests are in fact used to measure the viral load, basically the amount of viruses in your blood. One example of this kind of test is the Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test, FDA-approved in 1999: 

The experiment is published in the article "Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks" in PNAS. The authors state: 

This data is from resarchers of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), but there are also groups from the University of East Anglia and the National Climatic Data Center working on similar data. They are based on the same observations in the end, but they use different methods for analysis and thereby provide some cross validation of the methods. The data this graph is based on comes from meteorological stations on land (Hansen et al., 2001), satellite data and ship-based data on the oceans. One difficulty in analysis the data from stations is the influence of urban development, cities produce heat which could bias the results. To correct for that, Hansen et al. used satellite light data to adjust stations affected by urban development (Hansen et al., 2001). There are not many meteorological stations in the arctic, for that region the data is based primarily on satellite measurements (Comiso, 2006). Independent from the temperature data there are also other indicators for a global warming trend: 

I've seen the same statement repeated in the german media. The reason I'm skeptical is that this budget is around the same size as the reported budget for the CIA and NSA each. This seems to be an extraordinary amount for a single program, and I'm wondering if it is a misinterpretation of the leaked documents. This program is referred to as the "Consolidated Cryptologic Program" in the articles, what is the evidence that this is a program to crack encryption? And is the claim in the article that all of the $11 billion are spend on cracking encryption supported by the leaked documents? 

There is a News and Views article "Mesoamerica's Mystery Killer " in Science about this disease. It is not a peer-reviewed scientific paper, but a news article. The main hypothesis according to the article is that heat and dehydration in combination with other factors are responsible. But it does mention the pesticide hypothesis and the researchers asked about it were rather skeptical: 

In this study they also make the case that the curvature of the screens is important for such large displays. 

I'll use this Quickstart Guide to EFT (PDF) as a basis to discuss the Emotional Freedom Technique. EFT is based on the assumption that 

I would guess that the therapy you asked about uses far lower concentrations of H2O2 than 3 percent, because the higher concentrations are likely to cause some unwanted effects. Whether the ingestion is really dangerous depends strongly on the concentration of the hydrogen peroxide solution. I personally wouldn't ingest it in any case, but if it a very highly diluted solution it probably doesn't do much of anything. I would be worried about handling higher concentrated H2O2 solutions, e.g. if they add concentrated H2O2 to the water themselves, they have to be careful when handling it. 

There is an important point about the concentration of fluoride that Mercola doesn't address. The concentration of fluoride intentionally added to water in the US is according to the EPA between 0.7 - 1.2mg/L: 

AMI in this context means acute myocardial infarction, which is what is commonly known as heart attack. They used 11 different studies in this meta-analysis. The authors further state 

On first glance, most of the cited data seems to be about finding a correlation between lead and violent crime, the causative link seems to be much weaker. While it might be plausible that lead poisoning has some effect on later violent behaviour, I find it hard to believe that a major part of the increased crime between 1960 and 1990 was caused by lead. Is there strong evidence, preferably not only correlations, that show that lead poisoning is responsible for a large part of the rise and fall of violent crime in the United States? 

The first author Neil Z Miller is the director of the Thinktwice Global Vaccine Institute, which is decidedly anti-vaccination as a short look at their website will confirm. He also published a series of books on vaccination. This does not mean the paper is necessarily biased, but it is an undisclosed conflict of interest which is not a good sign. They are also not providing any evidence for causation, the linear regression graphs in your question is essentially the whole analysis the authors performed. There is an excellent deconstruction of this specific study by David Gorkski on the Scienced Based Medicine blog. I recommend to read the whole article, I will only summarize a few points here. David Gorski also notes the conflict of interest that I observed when I researched the first author. One aspect he point out is that the authors used only the data for one year (2009) and only for countries with IMR lower than the United States.
