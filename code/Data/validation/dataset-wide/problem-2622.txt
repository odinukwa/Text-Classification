You can contemplate it starting with 10-15 minutes or so and see how it goes, you might need inspirational material so you have a foundational structure to begin with, to keep you busy, preventing you from running out of thoughts. ie one could start out thinking along the lines "Death will certainly come to me!"...Life is uncertain,Death is certain!... All that is Born must Die" So one can spend some 3-5 mins on this before moving on to next theme. Thinking about how other people could not escape Death and its inevitability, ie The Buddha, The Great Arahants, one's own dead friends & relatives, music or movie stars, or other human or non-human beings for 3-5 mins before moving on to final stage. Contemplating one's own death, along these lines "In many ways can death come to me..." and the drawbacks of going on to be reborn. All of this should be done with Death potentially being close in mind, not 10 years or ten months from now, it can come before one finishes the meditation or this very day one can fall and die etc. There is no need to divide it like this in stages but it will be helpful to develope the meditation and one can adjust it later as one wants. One can pick and choose which way one does it and overlap is natural between "the stages" and it will get repetitive if one finishes and starts from beginning for a "second lap". So one should be picking the most appealing themes and dropping the stuff that doesnt do much for you after a while, elaborating, poundering and visualising, developing the meditation to last 30, 40, 60 minutes or longer. I think one should make an accent on thoughts of compassion in regards to one's own body when contemplating death, the body is vulnerable and is very fragile as it is so one should take care of it. One should contemplate in spirit of compassion and appreciation of the body as a vehicle to Awakening. This is a part i would not dare to neglect. Thats all you need to do, keep contemplating it over and over, it will eventually lead to incredible fruits. Look up both Maranasati Suttas 1st and 2nd, as i understand according to Sutta one is adviced to do it in the morning and in the evening. 

Here the term Bhikkhu is used not Ariya Savaka as one would expect if it was dealing with Sotapannas, some people claim that the early Suttas the term Ariya Savaka was used loosely even. So the fact that it is not used here is strong evidence that it means what it seems to mean. i dont think there are passages that i know of in the Sutta Pitaka that state it explicitly how OP asks because in the Sutta the term Sotapanna is used rather loosely, evidently from "Faith Follower", "Dhamma Follower" definitions ie. This is also evident from Ratana Sutta etc where The Noble Individuals constitute Four Pairs, so a pair of Sotapanna at least. Abhidhamma talks about one Cula-Sotapanna. So what is evident however one looks is that there are several people who according to Suttas can be referred to as Sotapanna of some sort. There are those incapable of passing away before realizing the fruit, do not have the Path but have Right View; 

I think that all humans and non-humans are Buddhists as in subject to laws of mental and physical realities expounded by the Buddha. Whether a person identifies as a Buddhist or not, does not essentially matter, they are still part of the same system. To me "a being" is synonymous with "a Buddhist" in that sense, although "a Buddhist" is a far more innacurate term in the sense that identifying as a Buddhist does not guarantee right view which is seemingly expected of a Buddhist but not of a Being. If OP does not like people then that is Aversion. Disliking is suffering. It is of little use to identify oneself with it as in saying i am such and such person, when likes and dislikes are very much conditioned and are subject to change, it is not appropriate to regard it as self. There is disliking, it will change, it is what it is. Do not make more out of it than it is, for when you extrapolate and worry about it you do it by means of attaching to it extra characteristics, this is attachment to likes and dislikes. 

Always because what is impermanent that is subject to change, change is uncontrollable, inevitable, not under ones domain to stop, That which is uncontrollable and impermanent is stressful to that extent. Endowed with three marks of impremanence, not ones own and stressful, that is the extent and that is the suffering there. 

This is from $URL$ by Ven. Bhikkhu K. Ñāṇananda Furthermore; Excerpt from Dhammapada: Twinned Verses (verses 3,4&5) 

Bad actions are inherently stressful and there is a natural tendency to want that which is not stressful and avoid that which is stressful. In example a person far and down could happen to see an englightened being and that could have a powerful positive effect on his mind or other mundane things like acts of kindness or giving, there is just a tendency to seek those things out once one gets a taste for the fruits of moral behavior, the higher the contrast the more obvious it becomes as a fool gets filled with evil he will suffer the consequences. It is like pissing at the wind, eventually one will just figure it out more or less even if by chance one will turn around a bit and discern it is as better. If discernment is not cultivated to a certain point it can deteriorate if one trains what one should not train, does not train what one should train and associates with wrong view. 

There are even lay people who have this attainment friend. Venerable Bhikkhu Bodhi is a good translator, unfortunately he is not famous for his meditation skills or achievements. Which may be plentiful, i would not know as monks are not allowed to claim any. I read that, The Buddha would not die before he had lay people and monks of both genders firmly established and capable of upholding. So The monastic community has no monopoly on attainments. If you are looking for attainments look for meditation monks in last 100 years. You can look for lay people too but that is probably impossible to verify in any way as they rarely explain their views and often weird people in general in that group who claims such things among normal people etc 

I would try the memorization technique that is recommended for bodypart memorization in Vsm. Mental and verbal recitation. 

$URL$ A popular approach to semantics in which the author discussess how to clarify the meaning of words and achieve more exact communication. About the Author Stuart Chase (1888-1985) Born in Somersworth, New Hampshire was an American economist and engineer trained at MIT. His writings covered topics as diverse as general semantics and physical economy. His hybrid background of engineering and economics places him in the same philosophical camp as R. Buckminster Fuller. It has been suggested that he was the originator of the expression a New Deal, which became identified with the economic programs of American president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He had a cover story in The New Republic entitled "A New Deal for America," during the week that FDR gave his 1932 acceptance speech promising a new deal, but whether FDR speechwriter Samuel Rosenman saw the magazine is not clear. ... His 1938 book The Tyranny of Words was an early (perhaps the earliest, predating Hayakawa) and influential popularization of Alfred Korzybski's general semantics which can still be read with profit. 

$URL$ You will also need to support yourself by calming the mind by non-regret and thinking delightful themes, ie friendly thoughts, your virtues, virtues of moral behavior, heavenly realms, good-will, reflecting on greatness of the teacher, those in training and those who have completed the training, on the goal, on the non-attractiveness, the repulsiveness, non-delight & Death. Biggest support you could arrange for yourself is to put yourself in a group where people are also training same things and run away from people who dont. If you live with people who are learned, follow same regiment, dont engage in chatter, hold same views and restrain eachother from falling away it will be a huge support. This kind of training will make you see straight. Thinking patterns will become progresively more pleasant and controlled, behavior will be based on that very thinking and thus of pleasant result. Even if you know your thiking is unpleasant now, the "pathways" to put it in wordly terms, the neural pathways are irrational because feelings are given higher value than their real value. It takes active "work", to weaken those "structures" and build a healthy world view to as a foundation for a happy life and healthy behavior. I guarantee if you do these things even for one day and one night you will have more or less solved your problem. 

OP reminds me of Richard Feynman s infamous lecture on quantum physics where he talks about reasons people dont comprehend his lectures and says that some people just dont like it, dont find it philosophically pleasing or psychologically easy, to these people he says that they just have to come along or move to another universe where the rules are different. I mean no offense, imo you asked a very good question in that there is a lot to say for one who has the time and ability. Consciousness in Buddhist doctrine is not synonymous with the English word "Consciousness". The word is Vinnana (wrong spelling), to find out what it means we should search the Discourses. What we will find is ie Vinnana Sutta: Where definition of what is Vinnana is given. One will see that (i simplify) it is "consciousness of" rather than just mere "consciousness" that is referred to. We also find the referrence to something called "vinnana anidassanam" and it is clear that this is not the same as "vinnana". Anidassanam is usually translated as without surface, as i understand it is like without a filter, consciousness rather than "consciousness of". There difference between the two is that one is a single element while the other is more of an event. Further; When we look to the Discourses for the difinitions on "Emptiness". We will find a Sutta called "Emptiness" Within we find a referrence to the most Exalted State of Emptiness. So what is the exalted state? Simply put, Emptiness is what is left when all is emptied out, in the same way that one would get rid of problems and be left with happiness. It is similar to when it is described as Cessation in that both Cessation and Emptiness come about by removal of something. I advise OP to find a well respected teacher who teaches what you think you can rightfully consider orthodoxy and in whom you can have some level of confidence in. Then pounder what you learn and see if you can come to agreement, always ask definitions and demand explainations to reasonable questions. Of course be a good student by doing what he says for meditation. Dont grind the theory if it is not easily grasped because it is likely that you lack some pieces of information, have some views, conditioned bias etc making it harder to connect the dots on your own and id want the skill of guarding well cultivated so you can be mindfull of the intellect faculty so doubt and speculations dont become views when studying and poundering teachings. At very least i strongly advise reading a book on language so that one is at least equipped with basic training in general interpretation of words. Book example is Tyranny of Words by Stuart Chase, 2nd edition can be found in pdf and will turn on into a legit genious relatively speaking. 

knowledge can be wrong, "panna" translated loosely as wisdom, is a technical term unlike conventional meaning of english word wisdom, the Panna is a faculty, it can not be wrong, it can be weak or strong, intense or dull, it can be trained and has discernment as it s function. The semantics of these two words are completely different. Like comparing functional muscle strength of a person to knowledge about physiology. As for the english word "Wisdom" it self, it s definition is very abstract, having asked 100 people you will get different answers with more or less overlap depending on enviroment, their views and access to dictionaries. It is important not to attribute english semantical meaning to pali words after translation otherwise the model will be completely confusing and irrational. The model i mean like how humans gather data about themselves and reality forming a model of the system to make sense of it. Better model, better discernment, more control essentially, less unexpected results. Like having a better map of the territory. Imo the teachings are like a map, when u have the map u can see the path, when u see the path you can go there, once gone there you posess the knowledge of teritorry. Territory is not the map, map is not the territory, knowledge of the territory is not like knowledge of the map. People s problem becomes thus that they have a shitty map and they project falsehood onto the territory, claiming a mountain is a lake, north is south, giving wrong directions, following wrong directions, getting into unwanted situations and getting others into unwanted situations. People do this, no sane person wants there to be war and conflict, it stressful. Yet because they are projecting their ignorance and views onto real world they are prey to their own intellect faculty in this sense. 

They are conjoined in the dispensation: what is samsara is dukkha, cessation of dukkha is cessation of samara and dukkha is a characteristic of samsara. analogy: What is water is liquid, cessation of liquid is cessation of water and liquid is a characteristic of water. It would not be appropriate to use them as synonyms always as they are different abstractions. 

The thing you are looking for is probably a misinterpretation of this passage from Maha-Parinibbana Sutta: 

On Vi: When training Satipatthana it is not the objective to get well-concentrated, the concentration comes in succession and has its role and appropriate function. IE it also is involved as a causal condition for people attaching to certain states and that hinders progress. Sati as a factor of Enlightenment, translated as mindfuless has function of remembering or keeping in mind, re-cognizing. Mindfulness of physical and mental states arising of and within a body is a single theme for the mind, which will develope concentration faculty no problem. It seems to me that you could try paying more attention to arising and passing of states of "disliking", "wanting/liking", "sadness/despair", "judging/evaluating", "doubting" and "thinking/wondering" as well as "knowing", knowing ie when your concentration is low you can know it as "my concentration is weak", then maybe "disliking?;)" or "wanting" for it to be better or "evaluating" that it makes you a bad meditator, should note that your are thinking at this point and see where it goes from there. You see it will keep you within the theme of mindfulness of the body, conditioning victory. 

It is very simple, the difficult part is figuring out what are Clouds. Because until we know exactly what is a cloud we dont know exactly what causes its origination. Conventional physics teach that Clouds are Made of up parts like Water, Water made up of Molecules, Those of Atoms and Those of sub atomic Particles which do not behave like matter at all, cant be said to exist independent of observation and are therefore difficult to study and understand with logic, therefore it is difficult to know real causes for origination of phenomena. Especially phenomena hidden like the mind which cannot be observed like a cloud can be, The Tathagatas know the Dependent Origination of All (see Sabba Sutta). 

It goes deeper yet OP. There is the 108 types of feeling exposition which covers all possible feelings (Pali: Vedana), below the relevant excerpts; explained as two types 

It is called Satipatthana Practice, the result is Vipassana loosely "clear-vision". Satipatthana is translated usually as "Frames of Reference" or "Foundations of Mindfuless", however translation there is Four of them: States of the Body, Mindstates, States of Feelings and Particular States (Hindrances). The practice is discernment of various experiences within the Four 

Goals are set and attempted to reach, attachments you either attach or detach. Functionally different concepts. One can be attached to a goal, that is attachment to a goal. What is ones goal, that one wants, what one wants one likes, what one likes that one is attached to, in this sense they are conjoined, not apart. If one says "My goal is to attach to X". Goal thus becomes Attachment and Attachment becomes the goal. The point here is that words are symbols, abstractions, not entities, they dont ultimately exist and take on a range of meanings in different contexts and do not apply in some. IE "Apple" is a word, if i point to an apple and say "this is an apple" what you see me pointing at becomes the object of referrence in this context. The word i used is a simple abstraction of the object of referrence, it is not the object of referrence. A seemingly healthy thing to pounder on is that it is Attachment of something to something, often Self-Identity or Judgement is ascribed to a concept. A goal becomes my goal, liking becomes my liking, attachment to the goal becomes thus my attachment to my goal. Suddenly one has postulated existence of the concept of self, if one then thinks that this Concept is the Object of Referrence rather than a convention of reasoning the problem arises, because that would be assuming that the word apple is on par with actually seeing the apple, naturally one would expect the word to be a real thing, in example of an apple one would come to expect that one could eat the word like one could eat the apple, obviously a critical mistake. In example of a Court session. One could say "Man vs State". "The State" is clearly an abstraction, in that room there will be men or women, men or women discussing and making decisions according to their knowledge, intent and conviction, there will be no "State" in blue gloves fighting the guy. The State is like that Self postulation. Maybe sounds obvious but it goes all way to demonstrate the limitations of reasoning for we can talk about some tangible object of referrence like an apple but also about feelings or things unknown, unseen, unheard, unfelt, unexperienced and therefore we will never know exactly what that object of reference is until we know it for ourselves it will be abstract no matter how many words are used to explain and how much we pounder it, it we wont have an accurate description of how is actually the object of referrence because we use words to reason and communicate.
