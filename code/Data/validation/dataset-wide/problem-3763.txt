Recall the following table of Clifford algebras: $$\begin{array}{ccc} n & Cl_n & M_n/i^{*}M_{n+1}\\ 1 & \mathbb{C} & \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \\ 2 & \mathbb{H} & \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \\ 3 & \mathbb{H}+\mathbb{H} & 0 \\ 4 & \mathbb{R}(4) & \mathbb{Z} \\ 5 & \mathbb{C}(4) & 0 \\ 6 & \mathbb{R}(8) & 0 \\ 7 & \mathbb{R}(8)+\mathbb{R}(8) & 0 \\ 8 & \mathbb{R}(16) & \mathbb{Z} \\ \end{array}$$ Here $Cl_n=T(\mathbb{R}^{n})/(v\otimes v-q(v))$ where $q$ is the quadratic function associated to the standard inner product on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. $M_k$ denotes the free abelian group on irreducible $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ graded modules (these are easy to work out as this group is isomorphic to the free abelian group of ungraded irreducible modules on the algebra of one dimension lower and these are all matrix algebras). Finally $i:Cl_n\rightarrow Cl_{n+1}$ is the inclusion. For example (using the above isomorphism) the first two groups correspond to $\mathbb{C}$ splitting as two copies of $\mathbb{R}$ as a real representation and $\mathbb{H}$ splitting as two copies of $\mathbb{C}$ as a complex representation. From here the table is periodic mod 8 (up to graded Morita equivalence). The last column certainly looks eerily familiar, it is the "Bott song" i.e. the coefficients of $\mathrm{KO}$. In their classic paper "Clifford Modules", Atiyah, Bott and Shaprio construct a class in $KO(B^n,S^{n-1})$ from a graded irreducible $Cl_n$ module using the difference construction where the trivialisation on the boundary is given by Clifford multiplication. They use this as well as knowledge of $KO_*$ to show that the aforementioned map gives a ring isomorphism: $$ \bigoplus_{k\geq 0} M_k/M_{k+1}\rightarrow KO_{*} $$ Here the ring structure on the left is given by the super tensor product of modules. This is all rather spectacular. It seems reasonable from the perspective of the construction of the ABS map (i.e. by taking the difference bundle of a $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ graded vector bundle) that some aspect of the representation theory of superalgebras over $\mathbb{R}$ (in particular the Brauer--Wall group) should be closely conceptually related to real K-theory. Another basic observation is that, via the clutching construction, one identifies the coefficient ring of real K-theory with the (shifted) homotopy groups of the stable orthogonal group. The group $Pin$ may be constructed as the subgroup generated by the unit sphere in $V$ inside the group of units of $Cl_n(V)$ and this is the universal cover of the orthogonal group. It is conceivable that these groups and their representation theory are of more fundamental importance in understanding the rôle Clifford algebras play. In Karoubi's book "K-theory: An Introduction" he provides an explicit construction of real and complex K-theory in terms of the K-theory of the Banach category of vector bundles with a $Cl_n$ action (this K-theory group is very similar in spirit to the above quotients $M_k/M_{k+1}$) and uses this to prove real Bott periodicity. Others have followed the same path and constructed K-theory classes in terms of something like bundles of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ graded Hilbert spaces with a $Cl_{n}$ action and a self adjoint operator switching degrees. Unfortunately I find these accounts rather technical and don't really intuit why such constructions are reasonable to expect. Question: Is there a conceptual explanation for the tight relationship (or some aspect thereof) between $KO$ and the representation theory of Clifford algebras? Finally the work of Douglas and Henriques aims to replicate the above for $TMF$. Here they replace Clifford algebras with conformal nets, the spin groups with the string groups etc. If there is any general philosophical perspective on what drives such a generalisation and in particular on which aspects are important in the classical picture, I would also be extremely interested. 

For example, if $A= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0.3 & 0.6 \\ 0.4 & 0.2 \\ \end{array} \right) $ Then $z=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0.8 \\ 0.2 \\ \end{array} \right)$ , $x=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{array} \right)$ , $y=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0 \\ 1 \\ \end{array} \right)$ Satisfy the conditions and $$x^tAy+x^tA^ty = 0.6 + 0.4 > 0.36 + 0.36 = z^tAz\ + z^tA^tz$$ 

Intuitively, it seems that every time you should pick a subset of bins and add balls to it $k$ times in a row. This would give a bound of $\approx\Omega(k\log_{1/x} n)$ iterations. Is it possible to make more iterations? How can we prove that this is optimal? 

I'm especially interested in bounds which can be computed efficiently as this is needed for a computer application. 

Notice that if condition (4) isn't true, then the claim doesn't hold, e.g.: $A= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{array} \right) $ And $z=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{array} \right)$ , $x=y=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 0.5 \\ 0.5 \\ \end{array} \right)$ 

Is there a closed-form formula for the distribution of $Y_N$ and $M_N$? If not, what is $E(Y_N)$ and $E(M_N)$? If the answer in (1) is negative, how fast can we compute $\Pr(Y_N = y)$? 

There are a number of proposed ways to compute the stable homotopy groups of spheres. One can rather peculiarly consider stable (co)homotopy of an Eilenberg Maclane spectrum as a generalised (co)homology theory and use the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence (in the same way one sometimes uses the Serre spectral sequence knowing information about the $E_{\infty}$ page to deduce it about the $E_{2}$ page). Another approach is to use the Adams spectral sequence. Here one plays off the rigidity of the cohomology of generalised Eilenberg Maclane spectra against this failing in general. This leads to a spectral sequence which converges to the p-part (where $p$ refers to taking cohomology in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$) of the stable homotopy group of spheres. A variant is to do this with some (nice enough I guess) generalised cohomology theory which leads to the Adams–Novikov spectral sequence. I think there are probably quite a few other methods which are used to calculate these. My questions are: 

Suppose I am looking at $GL(4,K)$ acting on a cubic form in say four variables $x,y,z,w$ over $K$ via the usual induced action on a polynomial. Does anyone know what is/where I can find how to compute the ring of invariants? The case of personal interest is when $K$ is a finite field but the the answer over $\mathbb{C}$ would of course be more than useful. 

Let $D=\mathop{Spec}(\mathbb C[[t]])$ be the algebraic small disk and let $\Delta= \{z\in \mathbb C: |z|<1\} $. Let $X_0$ be an algebraic surface over $\mathop{Spec}\mathbb C$ Suppose now that I have a deformation of $X_0\to\mathop{Spec}{\mathbb C}$ over $D$, that is a flat, proper (maybe projective) morphism $X\rightarrow D$ such that the special fibre is $X_0$. Question: Under which conditions I can find a degeneration $Y\rightarrow \Delta$ with fibre at zero (central fibre) $X_0^{an}$ and with the property that we can recover $X\rightarrow D$ form $Y\rightarrow \Delta$ in the sense that if I start with the $$Y\rightarrow \Delta, \text{with central fibre }\ X_0^{an}$$ and we consider the composition $\Delta\rightarrow \mathbb C$, to get $Y\rightarrow \mathbb C$. If $Y$ is nice enough (projective, finite type etc) I can use GAGA to get an algebraic family $\mathcal X\rightarrow \mathop{Spec}\mathbb C[t]$ and if now I consider the inclusion $ \mathbb C[t]\rightarrow \mathbb C[[t]]$ and let $X$ be the base change I get a family $\mathcal X\otimes \mathop{Spec}(\mathbb C[[t]])\rightarrow D$ with special fibre $X_0$ and an isomorphism $\mathcal X\otimes \mathop{Spec}(\mathbb C[[t]])\simeq X$ over $D$? If such a deformation exist, which properties are preserved? for example can I identify the Monodromy?
