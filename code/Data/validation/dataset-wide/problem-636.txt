You may want to use a cross strap if you have one (a strap that goes over the chest) to help stabilize the bag, and play with where the messenger bag sits. The width of the bag's strap also can have an effect, as well as the level of padding. I've also found that a loose bag, which can move around a lot, can cause pain while biking versus a bag that is held snug (but not too tightly) on long rides. They aren't for everyone, and some people would be better served with a backpack. For an actual messenger, a messenger bag makes sense, since they can quickly deliver their messages while hoping on and off the bike. If you're just going to work and only unpacking when you get there and when you go home, you don't have that advantage. 

Let it air dry (and/or wipe it dry as much as you can) and move on with your life. Don't put it near a heater, cause that isn't good for the rubber stuff. Re-lube the chain. What gets you in winter is not so much the snow/ice, but the salt (which doesn't affect your bike if its just standing there). In this case, if you have the time and space to bring the bike in for a prolonged period of time (say, overnight), you can wipe down the frame with a damp cloth, maybe clean+lube the chain and drivetrain and other parts you would do routinely (e.g. brake pivots if you're using V-brakes; I usually have to take the v-brakes off and clean the posts and what not at least a few times in a winter). Also, note that you can't rust out an aluminum bike, and this shouldn't really have caused a problem for a steel bike. A lot of people have bikes (steel or otherwise) which they leave out through winters and salt and survive fine for decades. 

Lower spoke numbers are primarily of interest to weight weenies (though for a given price, a lower spoke wheel will probably use a heavier rim offsetting the spoke reduction weight savings). As usual, Sheldon is some good reading. There is also a whole book on how to build wheels well and design decisions, by Jobst Brandt, called "The Bicycle Wheel". What matters for most people is using a good amount of spokes, good spokes, a good rim and hub, and putting them together well (and how they're put together) - pretty much any wheel is going to be bad if the wheelbuilder messes up/sucks. Heavier riders often should go with a higher spoke number than a lower spoke number and tougher rims+spokes. According to Sheldon, it used to be that you'd run 36 front, 36 back then we started dropping. On a commuter, I'd emphasize durability, so I'd probably go with the more spoke option. The best thing to do is talk to a good wheel builder and assess your individual needs. If you got to the point where rim wear was what made you replace the rim, chances are you're fine with whatever you had. If you're replacing the rim, make sure to use new spokes and make sure the hub is in good condition. 

The rim you have is a 700c (ISO 622) rim. You can use any 700c trainer tire on it (the tires will be labeled as ETRTO __-622 or 700x__ possibly with a "c" somewhere). The tire you commute on is a 700x35/37c tire and the trainer tire you have selected is one correctly sized trainer tire for this wheel. It's probably best to refer to the wheel as a 700c wheel, since that will be the terminology most people will be familiar with. Tire sizing is a mess due to different standards, so I suggest you refer to the wheel and tires you need in the forms above. Most people are not familiar with the inches+fractions system of tire sizing (which is not interchangeable with inches+decimals), and it can lead to confusion. The French system (700c) or ISO/ETRTO systems (ISO/ETRTO 622) specifications are much more common (with the tire sizes specified above). 

Most trainers on the market today can do 26", 29" and 700c. Specialized's cyclocross bikes are 700c, your trainer will likely be able to handle it fine, but check the manual (*). A trainer won't help you gain confidence riding in traffic though -- you'll just have to practice riding in traffic, which is the bigger problem here. (*) Your trainer may have specific recommendations, e.g. no carbon fiber bikes in the trainer or something. Read the documentation. 

butterfly bars and so on. The main issue is the (effective) top tube length, which forces a certain amount of lean due to how much you have to reach the handlebars. The seat can only go so forward and you can only get so short of a stem before the bike becomes unridable, and this is what generally precludes the switch from drop bars to flat bars on most frames and vice versa, since the effective top tube length might not be adequate in both cases even if the seat post and stems are swapped. This means you'll need a new frame if there isn't enough adjustment between the stem and seatpost positions to make whatever orientation of handlebars you try to work (you are pretty much free to try anything that fits, at your own risk of course). Also, note that your handling may not be as good as it was before you decided to do this adjustment. Heck, the sky's the limit. If you had a threadless stem+steerer, you can leave out the star nut and cap and install a second quill stem inside the steerer so you can run double handlebars as this example from Sheldon Brown: 

Different greases hold up varyingly well in different applications, depending on levels of dust, water, temperature, etc. Park Tool Polylube PPL-1/2 are your basic bicycle greases -- they hold up well under most people's riding conditions (including repelling water enough; others like Phil Wood or Park Tool HPG-1 might be more water repelling). Depending on the conditions, you may end up repacking a bit more often than others, but its not really all that big of a deal, so long as the grease is doing its job (which for most people, it will just fine; if you're riding in -50 C, you might want to pick something else). At the end of the day, note that many people are using just regular old multipurpose grease from the auto shop (that red stuff Valvoline sells for less than 5 bucks a pound) or marine grease and are doing alright (it's significantly more viscous than bicycle greases so not ideal; however, note that even a tube of Park Tool PPL-1 will last you quite a while, so the cost savings aren't immense for the home mechanic ). So, don't lose sleep over this. 

I'd check if the wheel was in properly and is in good condition (true) along with the tire being mounted properly on the rim. There is some variation in tires true sizes despite being marked the same size, though half a cm would be a lot larger variation than one could reasonably expect, especially with older tires. Features like studs, knobs can also affect this. If you have reasonable clearance for a given size of tire, one should reasonably expect a similar tire from another manufacturer to also give reasonable clearance, though this is not always the case. 

You have to try the different frame sizes. I'd suggest looking at 650b or 26" wheel sizes if possible though, or possibly a kids frame -- I would not recommend using 700c wheels, as is standard on road bikes, for someone under maybe 5'5". Some of the women's specific marked bikes go a bit lower in size than the mens bikes and most major manufacturers (certainly Trek/Specialized/Giant) produce them. Different frame sizes work for different people of the same height (depends on leg length, torso, arm length, etc.) and frame sizes aren't consistent between models of bike. So she has to try a bunch of bikes. 

So long as the fork is compatible with the frame (i.e. its for the right headset type, threaded/unthreaded, has the right steerer diameter, etc), you can run a fork for a different size wheel. Some bikes have been sold with different wheel sizes in the front and back (e.g. 69ers and 96ers). A shop should be able to help you with compatibility with your frame. Note that the bicycle was designed with some particular configuration of fork and wheel size in mind (some amount of suspension, rake, etc.) to achieve some level of performance. Deviating from this may lead to different performance of the bike. 

That being said, poor quality (and dangerous) aluminum forks have been made (the Viscount Aerospace pointed out by Brian Drummond in the comments is one example). As for whether or not to get the bike, its sounds like you're not all that confident in their engineering, and to me that would be a definite no on buying the bike. I'd rather spend a few more dollars on a bike than on a broken face. If the Trek 1.1 is out of your price range, either find something used and nice or look at other manufacturers you can trust (if you go to brands which are well reputed, but not Trek/Giant/Specialized, you can likely save a decent bit). 

Did you try adjusting it yourself? $URL$ Did you rule out the shifter/cable/cable housing causing problems? Try manipulating the cable tension by hand to shift it to see if this is the case and then work from the problem if it doesn't let you move the cage with reasonable cable manipulation. If it doesn't adjust and the shifter is good, I'd just replace it with the same thing that is already on there (note that you need to get the right clamp and cable pull type for your frame, so you might as well order it from the bike shop if you don't know what clamp type and what not you need). FD's are relatively simple parts that don't have a wide range of performance between grades, and its just about as cheap for what you have as with the lower group parts. 

The coach lines are the lines under the guy's hand. See also the wikipedia article on Pinstripes. My guess is that this bike may have had some sort of pin striping. 

You may want to try them on your frame. Also, you may want to try a different type of brake pad to see if they reduce the dust (e.g. kool stop salmons). 

This is quite tricky, given a trombone is not a nicely shaped instrument. You can try some larger racks, or mount some plywood or something to a smaller rack to try to get a more stable surface to carry the trombone (or be able to build something that allowed carrying the trombone like a pannier), but I doubt it will be very good, especially with all the additional stuff you want to carry. I do know some cellists who have strapped their cello to their backs and ridden (somehow), but I don't think it was a particularly stable or safe solution. The real solution I think is for you to get a cargo bike. One thing you might want to try is to do an Xtracycle conversion - the Freeradical was a kit which allowed you to extend a normal bike into a cargo bike (but is currently not being sold -- you may be able to find an existing bike/kit somewhere thoguh). Unfortunately, cargo bikes like the Surly Big Dummy and what not are not exactly cheap (and are not normal bikes), but your use case is pretty much what the cargo bike was designed for. An example of a Freeradical conversion is: 

WD-40 is the wrong stuff since it pretty much evaporates off. Motor oil is also not ideal. 3-in-1 oil is also not ideal since it gums up. Using a purpose bicycle chain lube will improve longevity. The particular choice of lube is a bit of a religious choice, but they are marketed with specific conditions quoted. You can find one at your bike shop on which riding conditions you do, and then use it. This link to Sheldon Brown is a good read on chain maintenance and when to replace your chain. For cleaning your chain, you can use something like the Park Tool CG-2.2 - its essentially a case, which you put in something like citrus degreaser and close it over your chain. then you spin the chain, and it brushes the chain and washes it in the degreaser. 

It seems like you're confusing the clamp diameter with the grip area diameter. 26 mm is a standard road bike clamp diameter (i.e. where the handlebar attaches to the stemp) and 25.4 mm is a standard mountain bike clamp diameter. Your stem needs to match the clamp diameter. The clamp diameter and stem must match exactly. The grip area diameters need to match for the brakes (which are 22.2 mm for mountain bike stuff and 23.8 mm for road bike stuff). Most bullhorns are typically 23.8 mm grip area, so they can use road bike levers. 

It's generally a good idea to use a trainer tire for a trainer, because the tire wears down significantly faster (plus they get hotter, make more noise, etc). Rollers don't cause as much tire wear as a trainer does, but they aren't exactly the road. Many people use their regular road tires on them without any adverse effects. Some people experience increased wear (on the back, usually). If you're really worried though, just buy some cheap 15 dollar tires and put them on your wheels. On a trainer, they wont last as long as a trainer tire but they will save your good tires. On rollers, you generally have less wear, but still, you're going to save your original tires (since they aren't being used). 

The datasheet for the crankset says it calls for a 123 mm spindle length. This would mean that your crankset would sit about a half centimeter further out than the existing one if you use the Shimano recommended bottom bracket, which will affect the chainline. I'd go for trying it out as is -- it will probably work. If the shifting is fine, and the chain isn't jumping or derailing when its not supposed to, you're good to go. If it is having problems after adjustments, get a new bottom bracket. 

Unlock the U-lock. Put the loops on the cable onto the U of the U-lock. Clip the U-lock to the frame as normal. 

Yes, you can reuse them. Just be careful removing the old ones, clean them up and then swap on the new ones. 

I'm not sure what you mean by Specialized and Trek are proprietary. Things you can upgrade are seatpost, saddle, wheels, derailleurs, front fork, stem, handlebars, headset, crankset, bottom bracket, cassette, shifters and none of these parts are particularly restrictive. Lets go through this in list form: 

A razor blade/knife/x-acto knife should cut it. Hockey shops have special knifes for cutting through hockey tape if you want a specialized device. This shouldn't be a problem for non-carbon bars though, if you're careful. The residue can be removed with rubbing alcohol or soapy water or mineral spirits (again, for carbon, I'm not sure what you'd do). 

Probably never -- headsets can easily last the life of a bicycle for most people without needing an overhaul. If you ride in the wet, it is advisable to have a front fender, though (to reduce the likelihood of needing an overhaul even further). 

The SRAM road derailleurs and road shifters you've selected should work together. However, the bigger problem might be that you need a 10 speed cassette (for which you'd have to look up the hub to see if its 10 speed ready). It seems like the 2015 YVR model has a 10 speed compatible hub, but check yours. If you don't have a 10 speed ready hub, you'll probably want to get a new rear wheel. You also need to make sure the SRAM FD/RD can shift your chosen chainrings + cassette. As for buying the best parts, note that the more you spend, there are diminishing returns, and you can get excellent shifting with well below Red 10 -- e.g. with Apex or similar. It doesn't really make sense to equip a cheaper bike like the one you have with top of the line components, especially since you probably wouldn't notice the difference from a lower end group. You can also get a mountain RD since the cable pull is the same and save some more money. I personally wouldn't go up to the Red level on this. Also, ask yourself if you really need 10 speed -- 8 or 9 speed is cheaper to run (chains, cassettes) and buy, especially if you rack up a lot of miles. And you're upgrades cost close to what the bike is worth or more, so you may want to just sell the bike and get another one with higher end parts.
