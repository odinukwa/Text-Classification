Yes. With advanced recycling technology, they could survive indefinitely. The technology to purify urine for drinking already exists. Here in 2017, there are already companies working at turning waste into edible, healthy food. If they're far enough in the future to get a million people to a distant planet, those technologies are already part of their culture like cell phones are part of ours. With devices similar to Star Trek's replicator, they could live pretty happily. My understanding is that it breaks matter down at the molecular level, then reconstitutes it into whatever new thing (like food or a beverage) is needed. 

It sure would have been nice to either kidnap a telepath, or raise one yourself. Keep a tinfoil hat on your telepath's head to prevent the thought police from finding him/her. Give your telepath a great sales pitch as to why the government is evil and needs to be overthrown. Then, your telepath could handle the guard(s) by saying exactly the right things to convince them, based on the guard's secret thoughts. Or your telepath could read the guards' thoughts to find out if the guards knew of any loopholes in the security. 

The other answers on this page are very thorough. Just wanted to add a thought. Imagine a planet with 2 moons, like Mars. Unlike Mars+Phobos+Deimos, one of the moons of this fictitious planet is far away, and the other is very close to the planet. At some points in the cycle, the far-away moon is lit and the nearby, tiny moon is completely in the planet's shadow. This black disk will pass (quickly) over the bright, faraway moon, making it disappear and then reappear. The smaller nearby moon could alternatively be a manmade (alien-made) satellite. 

There are some excellent answers here about science, philosophy, crime, and "What if you're having a bad day" scenarios. I want to talk about entertainment. People would read every book, watch every movie, check out every TV channel, view every YouTube video, and go through everything on every DVR they could find. After they had consumed all of that, the celebrities of the planet would be those who don't rely on a script to tell or act out a story. The celebrities would be those artists who can create a beautiful new painting every day. The celebrities would be improv comics. The poets. Dancers. Bloggers. Vloggers. Anyone who can create a work of art within the scope of one day that can also be enjoyed by others before the day is done. (The art could be something they'd started before time started looping; they would be a celebrity if they could complete it in a new way each day.) 

Data can be stored as strands of DNA. A DNA strand is essentially a linear, binary code, and it has excellent stability over time. There is a helpful Wikipedia article on it. Here is a section from the first paragraph: 

If the original ancestor from which all other branches of Reptilia spring includes those traits, I don't see why not. Although as with earth's alligators etc. differing from other reptiles, there will probably be some branches on Alternate Earth that don't have all those traits. 

I wouldn't think this would be practical. If her sword is in contact with an enemy (skin, blood, organs, other gross stuff) for even a short period of time, it would start to melt. If an enemy could get a hand on the sword's blade, he/she could hold it for 2-3 seconds and then remove the blade from the hilt. 

You specifically asked how to launch a satellite without the probe slowing down. The simple solution is that the soon-to-be-satellite is released from the probe at 0.2c, and through the satellite's own thrusters or gravitational assists (or both), it slows down to about 10 km/s in time to enter the orbit of the planet it will circle. 

Identifying the Milky Way by its appearance alone would be tricky. It's not an exceptional galaxy. Also, as far as I know, we haven't mapped a lot of it because we simply can't see through the dust and the dense galactic center to see what's on the other side. However, if our travelers can rely on our current technology AND on our current knowledge of the mapping of the known universe, it should be doable. They first map the large celestial bodies around them. Then they "fit" that map into their existing map of the known universe. Based on that "fit", they will know where they are, and of course they'll know where the Milky Way galaxy is. 

Option 1 The world is in an ice age, or has some other reason for its overall temperature going down. Settlements form around the lava tubes primarily for heat. It's a lot easier than keeping fires burning all the time! Option 2 There are MONSTERS in the world, but they are frightened by the lava and by fire. Humans, and other small, weak animals, learn to live by the lava to keep the monsters away. Over time they reach an equilibrium: the monsters hunt only animals that are far from the lava, and their prey happily live by the lava. Option 3 Pele. (Lava god.) The main characters of the story have formed a religion around the lava, and they live near it as a form of worship or to garner its favor. 

Some microscopic organisms use the corkscrew approach. Here's a page with some information and video about them. I don't know how practical that would be to scale up, considering the complexity of the brain, dizziness & sense of up and down, relative thickness of the material (water) they're moving through, etc. But corkscrew critters do exist. 

I say post-scarcity because the amount of food in nearly every home and every grocery store is more than enough to feed everyone for one day, no matter how much they eat. Your car will always have gas in it. You've got a closet full of clothes. There are empty homes and apartments and hotels that homeless people can walk into and live in every day. We've got plenty of electricity. And so on. The results of these factors (post-scarcity, nothing permanent can be created, everyone's immortal) will lead to people bettering themselves. They'll learn arts, languages, new skills. All "creating" will be reduced to things that can be done in one day. People will find they can accomplish more in teams. There might even be fun competitions to see which teams can create "more" (the biggest machine or contraption, the most elaborate work of art, the most incredible computer program) during The Day. We'll find out who we like hanging out with, and over the decades and centuries many of us will make new and different friends. As others answers have stated, we'll quickly find out how far we can travel during The Day. That will be our particular universe. For the novelty of it, since we're immortal, we'll wind up exploring every nook and cranny of it. We'll also eventually place a premium on communicating with people outside of our particular universe via video chat, telephone, etc., and using those same technologies to explore other parts of the planet that we can't (comfortably) reach during The Day. After a few years or decades we'll want to see more than our personal universe has to offer. . And most importantly, no one will have to eat healthy or go to the gym. Hooray!
