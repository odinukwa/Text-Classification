SWAT model has a pretty good technical and theoretical documentation on their website : $URL$ Regarding the conceptual logic, SWAT is based on sub-watershed discretization. Inside these, it defines Hydrological Response Units (similar slope, land use and soil). Then, you simplify it on the basis of the HRU heterogeneity, you may chose between assigning to the sub-watersheds the response of the dominant HRU or define a multiple responses. At this step, SWAT knows which parameters to use in the hydrological processes you have selected and can run the simulation. I would suggest that you read the introduction of the theoretical documentation and, assuming that surface runoff is a major contributor to your discharge, maybe the chapter 2.1 on surface runoff. You need to understand the Curve Number Method wich is used to compute runoff volumes. If you want to decrease runoff speed, you may increase the manning coefficient (friction to flow) for both overland flow or channel flow. As it seems that you have a time of concentration greater than one day, you should also check the surface runoff lag parameter [SURLAG]. But as SWAT is a sophisticated model with a lot of parameters and sensitive to scale, discretization methods and input resolution, it is hard to know what's wrong with your simulation. It is quite normal that a uncalibrated model, even physically based, provides results far from the observed discharge. To calibrate a model, you must first identify the most sensitive parameters by running a sensitivity analysis. Then, as you know what parameters will have significant impact on the simulated discharge, you can run a calibration by varying them in a physically acceptable range. Hope this help, D.D. 

I will try to bring you some insights. In my opinion, SCA is poorly named. Actually, the width is not involved in the catchment area which is given by TCA. SCA introduces a diffusive flow factor by considering flow width. It is a one dimensional value so it is not representative of an area and that's why it might be confusing. It gives us an idea of how concentrated are the incoming flow. Besides this, I think you are also confused by the outlet concept which is often defined in GIS or in some conceptual definitions by a point. But actually, in order to compute a flow at an outlet you need flow velocity and a cross section. If this cross section area is assumed to be rectangular, it can be defined by the width and the height will vary according to the incoming flow. So when the outlet is considered as a point, it is more like a targeter of the outlet that has some dimensional characteristics. So, for studies at the plot scale or the hillslope scale, the outlet is often defined by a line which is representative of the flow width at the downslope. For grid based data, a pour point targets a representative area defined by the spatial resolution of your terrain data. If a point has no flow width, this area has one and the flow width is generally assumed to be the cell size as mentionned in your quote. If you understand that, you may understand that the broader the width, the more diffuse will be the overland flow and therefore the less wet regarding the TWI or the less erosive. Of course, it remains resolution dependent. 

CC BY-SA 3.0 The main wind pattern is also western, but with prevailing eastern winds, they might end up in Scotland, depending on the vessel. The Jutlandic coast has experienced a large number of shipwrecks in the past. 

Ice floats with gravity towards lower elevation, the flow continues until the base of the ice sheet becomes floating and the ice forms an ice shelf or icebergs. Due to the subglacial topography, basal melting and mass balance, the flow velocities vary over a large range, faster outflows are glaciers. The pattern is somehow similar to how rivers transport rainwater towards the coasts. The thickness of the ice sheet is controlled by a complex relation between accumulation, ablation and compaction. 

It's an interesting thought. Antarctica is not so balanced as it might appear on the maps. East Antarctica is old, consisting probably of cratons and Proterozoic orogenic domains whiles West Antarctica is much younger, thinner and have mostly been accreted during the formation of Gondwana (See e.g Boger 2011). If there was a direct control of the location of the continents from the rotation, one would expect East Antarctica to be centered rather than the whole landmass as it appears today, moreover one would expect a similar continent, resting at the North Pole. However, Antarctica have been relatively stable, at least for the last 200My. The breakup of Gondwana could partly be simplified as one continent after the other radiating away from Antarctica, that mostly stayed in the same latitudes (See e.g Torsvik et al. 2010). Today Antarctica has relatively low tectonic activity and little continental drift, mostly a rotational component. My personal believe is that astronomic potential fields, as gravitational tidal forces, might become a more important parameter in future for mantle dynamic models and maybe even some tectonic mechanisms, but I might be wrong and studies so far (e.g. this) have not shown good evidences and didn't attract much attention. 

Finally, it's worth notice that the Internet is flooded by ridiculous conspiration theories about the lack of information about Antarctica. Whiles being entertaining to watch (with a couple of beers or so), there is not any truth in them, but the phenomina gives in insight in how myths and lies are created and blooming on the internet and how important it is to stay critical about unreliable sources. The reality is that Antarctica is very difficult and expensive to access and, thankfully, its sensitive nature is well protected by international agreements. 

The oceanic plates are themselves formed from the divergent boundary, so probably not. Even if a new rifting occurred exactly at the boundary, the result would eventually be that the ocean floor surrounds the divergent boundary. A very simplified model of an ocean would have a divergent boundary in the middle. This oceanic spreading center might have basaltic volcanic islands along it, and two mirrored plates on each sides, pushing towards neighboring continental or oceanic plates. 

What is a breadboard (retrieval) algorithm? Google Search yields precious few results, mostly from ESA. Another usage I found Albert, Preusker, and Fischer (2012), ENVISAT workshop: 

You can use simple logarithms to calculate the answer. The number of half-lives that have elapsed can be calculated with $$ - \frac{\log{f}}{\log{2}} $$ where $f$ is the fraction that remains. So plugging in the numbers gives $$ - \frac{\log(0.75)}{\log(2)} = 0.415 = 41.5\% $$ 

Does that mean we can say nothing? Well, it's not quite so pessimistic. There are many attempts to answer this question. The figure below shows estimates for the regional distribution of the shortwave and longwave cloud radiative effect, again from AR5 WG1: 

Not a full answer as that is hard to give. But: This is a diagram by Kevin Trenberth picturing energy flows in the Earth climate system: 

Never is a very, very long time. Almost never is a vague term. The age of deep ocean water has been studied with both models and observations, and both indicate a lower limit age in the order of thousands of years, rather than decades. Here, age is defined as elapsed time since contact with the surface, which would be the only opportunity for evaporation. On a geological timescale, all ocean water has ample opportunity to evaporate and fall back as rain again and again. On a human timescale, not so much: for some water in the ocean, it has been well over a thousand years since the last time it was near the surface. For an example of a recent study into the topic: 

Wikipedia tells me that, in electronics, a breadboard is a construction base for prototyping electronics. The details of the article do not appear relevant for the algorithm usage, but it makes me guess that the meaning of breadboard is related to prototyping. However, from context, it is clear that the job ad or the ENVISAT paper has nothing to do with electronics. What does breadboard mean in the context of Earth observation retrieval algorithm development (which are the only contexts I could find)? Is it simply a synonym for prototype, or does it have a different meaning? 

Saturation vapour pressure of water. Source: Chemguide. See also the (not very good) Wikipedia article on Vapour pressure of water. 

(Source: NCEI) The detailed structure is somewhat different, which has to due with local climate and circulation, but the overall trend related to humidity and proximity to ocean shows up in both. We can also see the mountains, which I would guess to be a snow albedo feedback effect (ever notice how nights get colder when the ground is snow-covered?). At NCEI you will also find similar maps for the rest of the USA. 

Out of the total water on Earth, only a tiny fraction is held in the atmosphere at any given time. Therefore, the direct effect of melting land or sea ice will not result in an increase in specific humidity. However, warm air can contain more water than cold air, according to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Therefore, the climate warming that causes the ice caps to melt, will also result in an increase in average specific humidity. This is (approximately) an exponential relation (I don't have access to my textbooks right now, but googling saturation vapour pressure water equation yields many forms; I do not include them here because none I found use SI units). 

Yes, such sunrises happens every year at the beginning and end of the polar nights at high latitudes. One can have a few days with a glimpse of the sun but disqualified sunsets and sunrises. Sunsets occur at the end of the midnight sun period by the end of the summer, the first sunset is not complete. 

I don't know the book and the quality of fiction are rarely in the facts. However, it is always nice to think about the spinning of our planet and how our theories and methods relate to the actual astronomic observations. Historically there have been a number of prime meridians, sometimes used simultaneously and sometimes to large confusion. However, what reference you use doesn't change the duration of day and year. The calendars clearly described by Fred and kingledion are there to synchronize the day of year with the astronomic reasons for seasons. Farmers as well as priests plan the year according to the calendar dates and expect equinox at same day every year and the harvest to be in the same month. You can think of the prime meridian as the offset and the calendar as the frequency of our time units. Even when we refer the time zone to Greenwich it is still only a way to express the relation between time zones. With a US prime meridian the sun would still rise about 6am at equinox all over the world unless the evil pope in the book also forced a time zone of choice to people living near other meridians. However there might be situations where it's practical or politically motivated to use the same time across meridians, even if it means that some people will have sunrise well into lunch time at equinox. Technically, by moving the prime meridian some 30° to the west while keeping the Gregorian calendar would only delay the correction dates with a few hours, but on the other hand, people living just East of the International Date Line will get their correction a day earlier, and might appreciate the new cardinal coordinates, if they have an extremely strong sense for daylight and time. The Gregorian calendar was an important step to adjust the supernatural believes to actual observations. A year that is 365.2425 days long suggests a more complex universe than any simple cogwheel mechanics. If the evil pope really would like to suppress logic and perception, he or she should change the length of our time units rather than just relocating the coordinate system. 

Some of the mountain ranges that today are located far from the coast, e.g. the Urals are formed from earlier convergent boundaries between continental plates that today are incorporated in larger plates. Convergent boundaries explains most of the mountain ranges (e.g the Andes, Himalaya, the Alps, Nihon Arupusu) but there are however some curious exceptions, e.g. the Scandinavian Mountains that are not located near any convergent boundary and might be the result of regional uplift. However, there is an interesting ongoing discussion on how these processes work.
