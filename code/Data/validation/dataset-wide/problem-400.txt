My suggestion is similar to some of the others, but with a subtle twist. The wizard doesn't generate energy out of nowhere, instead he actually feeds on the life energy of other people. In combat he drains the life energy of the people he's fighting so can recharge. You can slowly refill the pool from your own life energy without doing long term damage (you just have to eat a lot). Draining it from other people though is both painful and harmful to them - so it would be a major sacrifice for anyone to do it willingly. As a result it normally only happens in a hostile situation where all the mages feed on the lifeforce of everyone they are facing. Depending on what you need for the plot purposes you can have mages either able to draw from each other, be able to block each other, or have some mages able to do it. They are drawing life force directly though - not the magic pool which is separate. Consequences of being drained would be pain and premature aging. The aging would gradually reverse itself but repeated draining risks making it permanent. Ironically this actually favours smaller numbers in a fight - although being outnumbered is still a disadvantage in itself. So lets say an incredibly strong archmage gets jumped by 5 bandits including a weak wizard of their own. 

I have one option to add to Shalvenay's excellent answer - airships. If there was time to build it a custom airship can haul a massive load slowly to anywhere in the planet. Heavy lifting airships currently in design and prototype stages can each haul 500 tonnes. It's possible in fact that with a suitable frame for the creature a group of those could work together to lift even more. For example here is a 66 tonne airship, the prototype is currently operational: $URL$ Here is another company talking about 50, 250 and 500 tonne airships although obviously it may never actually come to pass: $URL$ 

Essentially all you need is for people to increase burning the dirtier kinds of fossil fuels (coal in particular) without sufficient safety in place and while increasing production and you don't need to extrapolate much beyond what we already have. Keep in mind also that things don't need to be immediately harmful for people to wear masks. Asbestos can get in the lungs for a long time before you show symptoms, but people still wear breathing masks to work with it. Now, these would still not be completely global, for example out at sea or a long way from industrial centers there would still be smog free areas - and as a result extremely expensive homes - but you could easily cover the vast majority of the available land areas, and certainly all major cities. 

Source: $URL$ The most visible change needed though would be the six meter wingspan. Each arm would need to be 3 meters long. In other words the arm would extend from their shoulder and the elbow would nearly reach the floor, and then the forearm would extend back up the same distance to place their hand by their shoulder. Even folded up this would be a massive deal, and would greatly limit them in their daily lives. The wrist may well need to be elongated as well to give the wings 3 points of articulation, which would mean the first two bones would not need to be so long but the hand becomes even less flexible and useful. While they would have no problem reaching top shelves they would have to be constantly folding their arms and find most areas designed for normal humans incredibly claustrophobic. All furniture and living areas would need to be designed especially for their use or be uncomfortable. In particular they would struggle to reach or do anything close to them, preferring to actually be a distance from anything they are working with. So in conclusion, your flying humans would have enormously over-long arms and clumsy few-fingered hands. They would have large massively muscled and protruding chests and thin fragile skulls. But they would fly. 

Since it is a fantasy setting you could capture small elementals or demons and have them running on treadmills inside the workings. Those treadmills then provide the power to everything else. 

Steps would most likely be replaced by ramps, roughened to allow a safe grip. Since ramps tend not to be so steep as steps then spiral ramps would most likely be used, although they would have quite a wide radius both to allow the centaur to fit around the corner and to allow the slope to rise enough before it meets itself. Centaurs do not need much more space than humans in a straight line, but when turning they need a lot more. I would expect to see no "dead end" corridors and certainly no sharp turns, instead turnings would be curves or would be small rooms big enough for a centaur to turn around in. In general their houses would need considerably more space than human ones just because of all that horse body the have to get around in them. 

This has been discussed and speculated about a lot, particularly 20 to 40 years ago before the human population explosion had started to decline and people were trying to come up with ways to handle unconstrained population growth. The term for what you are describing is arcology. No-one in the real world has actually built an arcology yet but there have been a number of experiments and concepts with them. Several (For example Crystal Island in Russia) were started but then abandoned or put on hold. An excellent novel that looks at the social implications of arcologies is "Oath of Fealty" by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. It's set in the near future so is more relevant to our current tech level than most sci-fi arcologies. 

If it's dense enough then something like skies would actually work quite well. You have "ski poles" with large surfaces on the end, you stand in the skis and you push back behind you with the poles to keep sliding forwards. You might even be able to move like ice skating, without the poles, although it would be interesting doing that without tangling the skis. When you get tired a few floats would allow you to lie down on the lake.
