Sounds like you're looking for opposing features. A good/great folding bike will cost more than the equivalent full-sized bike. A cheap folding bike will have the bare minimum warranty permitted in your location. For example, the warranty on a Giant bike is 

I've done something similar with a 6 speed bike (42 tooth chainring, and 14-28 rear. Its now a 48/38/28 with an 8 speed 11-32 cassette, so the lowest climbing gear is 15.4 gear-inches. A folding bike is kinda bad for touring for multiple reasons 

Answer (tl;dr) Find another route. I checked around using google street view to get the image in the question. Some observations... 

Wait for Moz' answer because he's build a lot of trailers. The bigger the wheel, the better the trailer will roll over stuff. That is, a 16" wheel would hook up on a pothole that a 20" would just bounce heavily through, and a 26" wheel would take it in stride. Assuming the wheel mounts direct to the trailer chassis, a 26" wheel bike would give you a level trailer with 26" wheels, or a slight downslope to a 20" wheel. Although in practice 26" bike to 20" trailer is unnoticeable while riding. Height of load - you might choose to mount the wheel hubs above the floor of the trailer. This will ease loading somewhat, and will make the trailer more resistant to rollover on corners. Given your intention is a single wheel trailer, you can consider the trailer's wheel as a spare for your front wheel. So I'd ensure the two wheels are interchangeable. Or you could use a second rear wheel, with or without a cassette, as a spare. The dropout width locks you into a front or a rear wheel. Front wheels are more common "spare" 

Sounds like one of four possibilities. 1) Pulling on the shifter has bent the derailleur - very unlikely unless you're a gorilla or the derailleur was already bent/weak 2) Your gear cable outer is weak somewhere and the extra tension has caused it to collapse, which effectively makes the inner longer than it should be. 3) (was 2b) Your shifter was weak and has bent or the number indicator has moved/bent. 4) (was 3) Most likely, you've stretched or pulled the cable through the adjustment bolt on the derailleur mechanism. Hang the bike up on a repair stand, or use rope/cable/something to lift the back wheel clear of the ground. Use your hand to slowly pedal and pull the exposed gear inner wire with your other hand while pedalling. The gears should change like normal, through the full range. If this works, then the inner wire is too long and needs some slack pulled through the adjustment bolt on the derailleur. See "four rear derailler adjustments" section at $URL$ for details on that. 

As-is no. But if you're dead-keen to do this there may be a way to get a proper frame-builder to cut the stay and fit some sort of a "gate" or structural member that can be opened, then closed to restore rigidity. Something vaguely like the threadded latch on a climbing carabiner? You'd also swap out both rear dropouts with horizontal ones for tensioning the belt. Expect this work to cost a lot of money, and there will be repaint costs too. If you have an aluminium frame this will basically be impossible. With steel it should be cheapest, and carbon fibre I don't really know.... Do talk to a qualified and expert framebuilder, don't try and do it yourself. Your final option is sell off this bike and buy one with the specs you really want. A racey bike like your trek, with a carbon belt and an IGH or singlespeed is relatively uncommon. 

ANSWER 1 These can totally be used instead of loose bearings. There are fewer balls to carry the weight, and over time the cage may break down and get chewed up. 

I personally have no experience with carbon fibre. However there are carbon repair specialists who can tell you the damage. Find one of these specialists locally, and ask the seller to get it checked. You should share the results with seller, even if you paid for the testing youself. On no account would I buy the bike and then get it tested. Right now its the seller's property, but once cash has changed hands its yours, and previous owner is under no obligation to refund you should the test results be unsatisfactory. 

Another trick is to read off and note down the serial number, and then either check it online there or go away and check it. There are too many registries and far too many unregistered bikes, but this can put the wind up a dodgy seller. I've heard excuses like "my wife bought it and then didn't want to ride it" when the bike was a light carbon road bike, and the couple.... weren't light. This is a bit more about buying bikes, but being given a bike would be similar. If its suspicious, then might be sour. 

the smaller one at the top of the photo is part of the lock-on clamp holding the grip in place. It can be removed, there is likely no nut because it threads into the clamp. There will be a matching bolt at the outboard side of the grip too. The big bolt closest to the middle of the photo is probably holding your brake lever to the bars. It can be undone completely. There is a medium chance of having a nut on the other side, so don't loose it. The bolt at the bottom of the photo will be holding your gear levers in place. Same as for the brake lever, this can be undone completely and some chance of a nut. 

No I've not done that, and it would likely be a bad choice for an ebike conversion due to lifespan of motor. Electric motors have an optimum rotational speed which depends on their design and the number of coils on the armature. Your wiper motor will have a speed of around 2000 rpm, and it will drive a worm gear - see the excellent photo in @Frisbee's answer. That worm gear will drop the output RPM to 1/50th or about 40 RPM. The output will be a low speed and high torque. This means the motor wants to spin at a fixed speed, not faster and not slower. A wiper is also driving a cable or rod system that has half a kilogram of wiper blades attached, compared to the weight of a bike plus rider. So there's the duty cycle to consider too-how hard the motor has to work. Remember its a brush based permanent magnet motor intended for forward-backward-stop duty in a relatively cold environment, so running it hard out is not a good idea. Finally, you'll need to fab up some way to mount the motor and apply drive to the bike. Your options are 

Some suggestions: Follow someone else who better than you. Try to keep up - you'll be looking at where they are, ahead of you helps you anticipate whats coming up. Ride the same track in the dark, and its a whole new experience. Your light only throws so far - even the best ones only reliably show up 20 metres ahead and that tends to be a spot not a flood. Lower your saddle a bit - less aero and more upright will help a bit.
