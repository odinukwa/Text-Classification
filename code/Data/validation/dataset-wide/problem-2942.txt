We want to show that (E v C) is true. Now, suppose E is true. Then we're done So, suppose E is false. Since D > E, D must be false. Since B v D is true and D is false, B must be true. Since B is true, ~B is false. Since ~A > ~B and ~B is false, ~A must be false and A must be true. Since A > C and A is true, C must be true. So either E is true, or else C is. QED. Or as I learned in a MOOC with a lot of French students, CQFD, ce qu'il fallait démontrer. 

Of course every object has a property, that of being an object. In the absence of the OP stating what is meant by an object or a property, no other answer is possible. But it's clear that when it comes to abstract objects, at least, it's not necessarily the case that every object has a property that uniquely characterizes the object. The real numbers form an uncountable set; but if by property you mean a finite-length string over a finite or countably infinite alphabet, there can be only countably many properties. Therefore almost all real numbers have no property that applies to that number and no other. 

You're mis-stating Chaos theory. You said: "I understand that chaos theory states that any small event or choice determines the next set of events or actions." But actually you need to say that SOME systems are extremely sensitive to small changes in their starting point. Other systems are stable. So there can be no counterexample. If you have a system that's stable in a region around a point, that's an example of a system that doesn't happen to be chaotic. It's not a violation of chaos theory. That's like saying, Some animals are cats. Can there be a counterexample? A hippopotamus is an animal that's not a cat. But it's not a counterexample to the statement that SOME animals are cats. Some systems are highly sensitive to changes in their input. Some are not. Some systems are chaotic, some are not. And you can't "argue" against chaotic behavior. You can just "do the math," as they say. The points around the boundary of the Mandelbrot set exhibit chaotic behavior. Tiny changes in your starting point produces strikingly different behavior under iteration. That's a fact. You can't argue against it any more than you could argue against trees. 

If the scope of the question allows for philosophical answers then it is clearly philosophical. If it can only be answered acceptably from a scientific standpoint then it clearly isn't. To put it another way, if the questions premises preclude the possibility of Kantian subjectivity regarding knowledge of time and space, ordinary language analysis, feminist critique, etc., then it is perhaps not philosophical. If Plato and Hume and Nietzsche cannot possibly bring anything to the discussion, the question might be more physics than philosophy, so to speak. In the end, if the question is premised on the same set of assumptions about the world that one uses in the scientific investigations of physics, then as philosophers we should be on guard. One feature that distinguishes philosophy is the questioning the foundations if our world views. 

It seems as if your support for classifying Nagel as a panthesist is to take him at his word in regard to his claims about his beliefs without exception except when it comes to his claim about his atheism. I don't see any reason to carve out this exception or to assert Nagel is using "atheist" incorrectly based on the evidence provided in the question. Therefore, no. 

For Kant, we can only see objects that take up space because space is an a priori condition of all human experience of the external world[1]. For Kant, space does not exist independently of human experience. We might say space is the medium of our experience of the external world. Experience of the external world without space is as sound in a vacuum, for Kant it doesn't exist. Kant's point is metaphysical (and perhaps psychological). Wittgenstein's point is about language. Pictures have borders, we are only confusing ourselves and perhaps others if we talk about the part of a picture that isn't on the canvas. [1] For Kant, time is the a priori condition of all inner experience. 

All physical measurements in the real world are approximate. To the extent that calculus is used to model physical phenomena, it is an approximation to reality [if one believes in an underlying reality at all ... a separate question.] However, within the scope of mathematics, calculus is exact. That's because calculus is based on a logically rigorous theory of the real numbers, which are based on a logically rigorous account of set theory. That is, we can start from the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory, published in the early 1920s, and we can then develop the theory of the real numbers and calculus from those axioms. In that respect, calculus is an exact theory of some imaginary or fictional entities; since (as far as we know) there are no real numbers in the physical universe. So, you are entirely correct that calculus is only an approximation to the real world, whatever that may be. But within the domain of pure mathematics, calculus is exact. That's because the real numbers and sets in general are only abstract mathematical entities. They do not necessarily have any analog in the physical world. 

A necessary truth is one that follows from logic. A contingent truth follows from happenstance. Consider a theorem T of Euclidean geometry. It has no truth values about the real world; because we have not specified an interpretation. Theorems are syntactic entities; but truth is a semantic one. The best we can say about a theorem is that it is or isn't provable from the axioms. So when we assert T, we are really making the assertion "T is a theorem of E" where E represents the axioms of Euclidean geometry. "E proves T" is a true statement; and moreover, it's a necessary truth, because it follows directly from logic. In fact you could write a computer program that can verify the validity of the derivation from E to T. Theorem checking is algorithmic procedure. [Theorem finding, especially the finding of interesting theorems, requires a human.] Notice that we can say nothing of the truth value of T. T is a formal statement, it has no meaning. If we interpret T relative to modern physics, it might be false. If we interpret T in the Newtonian universe, it might be true. Truth is always relative to an interpretation. Now, consider the statement, "I am left-handed." In this world, that's true. But what about other possible worlds? I could have been born right-handed and my life would be pretty much the same. "Socrates is a philosopher" is true in this world; but in some other world, Socrates was a fishmonger. Now you might say, What do you mean, "possible world?" I admit that this is a very deep subject with an extensive literature in philosophy; and that I'm ignorant of all of it. I do know that it's a murky notion. Is there a possible world in which 2 + 2 = 5? We tend to think not, because 2 + 2 = 4 is a necessary truth. But why is that? I can imagine a world in which I'm righthanded. But I can't imagine a world in which 2+2=5. So my handedness is a contingent truth; and 2+2=5 is a necessary truth. Summary: Each theorem T of Euclidean geometry is neither true nor false by itself. If you give me an interpretation, I'll tell you if it's true or false. But, the statement "E proves T", where E is the collection of Euclidean axioms, is in fact a necessary truth; because it's provable by logic. "Euclid wrote The Elements" is a contingent truth. In some other possible world, Euclid herded goats and somebody else wrote the first modern math book. 

In practice, we would tend to have a strong logical presumption that is not identical based on one being called "a" and the other called "b" because the difference in names implies a spatial and/or temporal difference in the conditions under which each is encountered. The burden of proof falls on those claiming "Hesperus is Phosphorus." The premise that classic philosophic logic has some strong principle of identity is a bit suspect in itself. The Ship of Theseus has been an important paradox since the early days of philosophy. The real problem is that "the same" requires disambiguation if we're talking in a logical context. Thus formal languages in computing often have multiple predicates for sameness [e.g Lisp's , , and ]. Pierce's pragmatic maxim perhaps points the way. is not identical if and only if the effects of are not identical to the effects of . 

Having been a companion to dogs throughout my life, I don't generally suppose that dogs are not self aware. Unless one defines 'thinking' as only encompassing the way in which humans think. In that case, the answer is "No dog's cannot think." Another consequence of that would be that computer's cannot think. A third would be that if there is a god, it does not think. Otherwise, there is no more basis for believing that a dog can think than that another person can think. Likewise, there is no more basis for believing that a dog cannot think than for believing that a person cannot think. 

Practical question Entirely hypothetical question of ethics here. Wanting to know what the great ethicists would say. There's a paper concerning a particular topic of math I'm interested in. The paper is behind a JSTOR soft paywall. Meaning that in order to read it for free, you need to 

As we see, logic is one set of tools we apply after doing a lot of other homework ... not only establishing facts, but also putting them in the context of our own preferences and desires. If logic was all that existed, commerce could not exist. A seller holds a good, a buyer holds currency. By "logic," one is greater than the other, and no trade can occur. But each using their own reason, the seller values the money higher than the good; and the buyer holds the reverse values. They trade and they are both happy. If pure logic prevailed, this could not happen. One party would have to lose and the other win. But preferences are subjective; even though logic is objective. Thus reason encompasses more than logic. One could give many examples. There's a story reported in the newspaper. One person believes the story, another doesn't. They then take rational actions based on their information and beliefs; but they each take different actions. Two machines given the same programming will produce the same output for a given input. Two humans often do something different given the same inputs. Reason is much more powerful than logic. If there is insufficient information, or contradictory information, logic is powerless. But reason can always find a sensible course of action. As I noted in my comment above: We use reason to make rational choices in situations where logic fails. Isn't that pretty much the common everyday experience of everyone? You go to get your morning coffee. Is coffee bad for you? Maybe. It's a mildly addictive stimulant. Is it good for you? Maybe. Some think it forestalls diabetes. It's full of antioxidants. Are those good for you? I guess so, I saw it on the Internet. But what about the beans? Are they fair traded? Was someone unfairly exploited in the production of those beans? How much do I care? How much can I know, even if I spent all my time and energy trying to find out? And what about the milk? Whole or 2% or none? Are the cows being mistreated or are they happy? Pros and cons to every choice. Sugar or artificial or none? Does your brain lock up in an infinite spiral of confusion? For some people whose rationality is compromised, that's exactly what happens. For normal people, we are aware of all that information but we put it in its proper perspective: things we can't do anything right now. We have our coffee. Or not, if we prefer not. Either way we're using our rationality to cut through a mass of facts and rumors that can not possibly be analyzed to their last detail. Where is logic? If a perfectly logical being existed, it could not function. It couldn't even get a cup of coffee in the morning. But you and I function just fine. Our reason allows us to put all that overwhelming and conflicting information in proper context ... which is that in the scheme of things, it's all not very important. Unless the individual chooses to make those things important. Maybe you refuse to drink beans that aren't organic and fair-traded. Maybe I order a cup and don't think about it much. We're both being rational. Neither of us is being logical. Logic is hopeless in deciding whether and how to have your morning coffee. Only reason can save us. Logic's useless. Reason lets you ignore all the inputs that simply don't matter. Reason is what lets you function in a world of conflicting information, where logic fails. 

Yes Kant was right about space and time (and no he was not wrong about knowledge) where being right about space and time and not being wrong about knowledge are epistemological claims. Critique of Pure Reason is a response to radical skepticism. It offers the comfort of legitimizing the existence of facts in regard to empirical phenomena. The price is that the these facts are always subject to the caveat that they are mediated through and limited by the natural limits of human experience. We can talk as if the results of an experiment confirm facts about space and time, but we're simply committed to a convenience. Humans can wonder What is it Like to Be a Bat, but it is an error to assume there exists some bat so Nagely as to wonder what it is like to be a human. There is no legitimate basis for a claim that bats can wonder at all. To say that "Kant was clearly wrong" is to misunderstand the problem he was tackling. For millenia, the best philosophical responses to radical skepticism required Descarte's gods and proofs thereof. After Kant, it was still about two hundred years until G.E. Moore's offered a simple god free response to radical skepticism. However, the horrible price for Moore's stance is any claim to being clever. 

No. Kant just considers plain old unadulterated pure reason. He does not look at pure reason plus now with bacon. Perhaps that's because by "pure", Kant means pure and non-human reasons are experienced as phenomena. The only reason we have access to as a ding an sich is human reason. Not requiring a super natural being to keep the world in order while not falling into radical skepticism is the cornerstone of his insight. 

I would like to draw attention to writings of Rene Descartes. This is from Part II of his Principles of Philosophy (Kluwer, 1982) 

The imperative directs somebody to the universal moral system. The GR keeps her within her individual feelings, desires, fears, perceptions, stereotypes. GR looks as something general but it is empty - these are its applications that matter, and they are mostly subjective. This is just my answer - I am not sure that Kant's reasoning is similar. 

It is supposed generally, that a moral choice is a conscious one: the agent knows exactly, what she is doing and what moral implications or consequences her act has (no matter that in reality she, may be, has no time for any reflection). If her intention is immoral, so the act will not get a moral value. Usually, others have no access to this conscious content and can only guess or calculate it. Nevertheless, they need this content in order to assign properly the moral value to the act of the agent. Note that in this particular case the conditions of the problem suppose that this content is known for us. One can expect that a feeling of gratitude to this killer would captivate people and it will show an indulgence to her... overall behavior. However, not all would be captivated, and less of all the police. Update 1. I would propose to resolve the question by using notions of public and private. People actions are public - they are accessible for everybody and everybody can give her opinion on them. The thoughts of the agent are the other thing - we do not know them. However, I would say, that they could be divided in two parts. One part consists of nearest intentions – intentions properly speaking. In the current case, these intentions are (a) she wishes to kill a dangerous person with explicit consent of the society (b) she refrains from killing innocent people. She has made her choice, and this choice is explicit. In other words, it belongs somehow to the public domain and we have right to discuss it, may be to ask the agent about it and so on. Her other thoughts are from the private domain - agent's feelings, her selfish wishes, fear of jail etc - we have no moral rights to refer to them and to use them when elaborating our judgment about moral value of her acts. For example, I can suspect that this killer has some evil wishes. Anyway, I have no right to express my suspect and should be respectful to her as would be to any other moral person, because from the moral point of view she acts appropriately and makes right choice - (a) and (b). 

You are correct that until we know there are numbers, we have a formal theory but not yet any domain where the theory can be interpreted. There are two ways to go with this. 1) It's clear that we all know what the natural numbers are. Even if we don't have a formal theory about them, it's clear that they satisfy PA and are therefore a domain in which we can interpret the axioms and theorems of PA. 2) We can formalize the axioms of set theory, say Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF). Then the concept "exists" means "can be shown to exist from the axioms of ZF." Then we can say that the empty set stands for zero, and the set containing the empty set is 1, and so forth. The objects of this construction are known as the Von Neumann ordinals. $URL$ Now we can verify that the numbers 0, 1, 2, ... as defined by Von Neumann, satisfy PA; and therefore we have a set in ZF that can serve as a domain of interpretation for PA. The same thing is often done pedagogically with the real numbers. The usual procedure is to list the properties of the real numbers such as the commutativity of addition, the distributivity of multiplication over addition, and so forth. That's good enough for calculus class and lets you do everything you need to. In a math major class called Real Analysis, they'll show that you can start with the rational numbers, and construct a model of the real numbers using Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences. They show that to the students once, and from then on everyone forgets about it and just uses the properties of real numbers. In practice it turns out that most of the time nobody cares about the ontology of mathematical objects. All you need is their properties. But ultimately you're right, if we're going to be logically comprehensive it's not enough to write down the axioms of PA; we have to show that we can formalize something that satisfies them; and that's where the Von Neumann construction comes in. 

Meanings don't come from cosmic process in the manner of Helium. Meanings are constructed by people. is ordinarily the same as because that's what we ordinarily mean by "is ordinarily the same". Occasional experiences of philosophical confusion result from a mistake: That meanings have some existence independent of our use of them and a general consensus among us as a language community. Playing along with the confusion requires us to ignore the subtleties of the consensus: The we don't say that the 's in and are the same in ordinary circumstances. [1] Take two Wittgenstein and call me in the morning. [1] We are ordinarily very clear about the contexts in which we would say that they are, e.g. substring matching. 

Political sanction: there are no official state superstitions nor high priests of superstition. [at the one sentence level of question and answer and analysis]. 

Like many philosophical concepts, one need look no further than Plato. The Delphic maxim γνῶθι σεαυτόν or "know thyself" is oft used by his protagonist, Socrates. 

The question presumes that we have epistemic access to objective causality, or at least that we believe we have such access. However, any non-skeptical theory or law of causality presumes that causes and effects exist with the price of avoiding that presumption being utter incoherence. Philosophically speaking, one must either have their cake or eat it. An argument based on causality can't serve as the rational basis for raising concerns over how anything can exist. Logically speaking, if one's cosmology already admits the supernatural - perhaps in the form of a beginningless and endless pure being that arranges all things - then requests for evidence are not asked within the spirit of scientific enquiry. Not that there's anything wrong with that, only that one must accept the the character of inputs determines the character of outputs. That is to say that deducing a contradiction means that at least one of the premises is false. For example, a contradiction derived from the original question means that "There is something which exists that was never created" is false.
