From a quick glance, it looks like the difference is that the new finance minister is including promised payments that the government had previously made, but hasn't had to pay yet. For example, say I borrow \$10 from you. At the same time, say I had previously promised (in an unrelated interaction) to give you \$5 at the start of June. What's my current debt to you? Officially, it's \$10 (from the loan you had given me). But come the first of June, if I haven't paid you back yet, I'll find myself in debt to you for \$15: \$10 from the loan, and the additional \$5 from the promise. Effectively, the new finance minister is counting the debt to be the entire \$15 (that is, current debt obligations, as well as promised future payments to different projects in Malaysia), while the official figure only considers my debt to be \$10 (since I don't yet technically owe you the additional \$5). Technically, the government official figures are correct, since the government can "get out" of the future payments by (I'd assume) changing the law to remove themselves from that responsibility. At the same time, since (it looks like) those payments are to Malaysian government/private company partnership projects, simply refusing to pay would ultimately undermine Malaysian projects, which would hurt citizens. Which is more important depends on the context, and the interests of the individual. 

Whether rising housing prices are a good or a bad thing depends on the stage of business cycle. If the economy is coming out of recession or economic growth is slow (below average), as it is now in 2017, then rising housing prices are generally a good thing. Housing reflects the broader state of the economy. People have more money to pay for houses, homeowners and companies benefit from real estate appreciation, lenders/borrowers are more optimistic, construction and related industries are hiring to build more houses, etc. If the economy is going strong and prices are rising rapidly, that is the sign of overheating. Lenders are lending recklessly and buyers become speculative (buying only because the prices are going up). It is not good because it causes a real estate bubble. Eventually it bursts and a lot of people lose a lot of money, like back in 2008. Or even like in 1990's in Japan: 

In practice, there are many variables to it. I know such theories have extended lists of ceteris paribus (with everything else held equal). Hold enough things equal and elasticity can always be higher in the long run. I'd like to add a few examples to the ones dsmithecon provided. When people's buying power drops in the short term due to some crisis. One can switch from driving a car to a bicycle during tough times and then go back to driving the car when income goes back up. New substitutes can become available in the short term. Same example, a bicycle would never be considered by some if they could afford a car. Historically this happened even to staples such as bread during famines when people would start eating stuff they never ate before. It was especially acute before central banks figured out to ease monetary policy during crises or there were no central banks at all. Or gold or strictly limited commodity or currency of another country was used as a currency, or still is in some places. Or there are constraining regulations in place. Or a command economy entirely. I could probably extend this list even more, but the point is as far as I know there isn't an economic theory that exists without assumptions and can have a general proof or be completely refuted. If something is challenged, it is often added as an assumption and the theory may look sound again. It doesn't imply economic theories are wrong or even flawed. Economics, as all social sciences, deal with so many variables there is just no way to control them all and come up with something general, proven, and irrefutable. 

I realize this question might be too old to reply to, but it was just bumped to the homepage. But anyway: I think other answers might be missing the forest for the trees a bit. Most basic economic models could be defined with either "stocks" or "flows" as you've defined them. Ultimately, it's about measuring productivity in a generalized production function. You can define the inputs however you'd like- labor could be defined in "full time employee equivalents," or "hours worked," or a vareity of other things. Capital, as many other answers have noted, is incredibly hard to pin down in some cases. That said, it can often be defined and measured through depreciation, investment, "hours of machine X used," "number of tractors used," etc.. More generally, both are pinned down by their relative factor income shares: an early estimation of which led to the creation of the Cobb-Douglas Production Function, which is an instructive example. For that, you define labor as the number of person hours worked (so if you worked for two companies, four hours each, it would count as 8 total "units" of labor), and capital as the total value of all machinery, buildings, equipment, etc.. You then look at how productive resources are allocated between the two, and back out income shares. For this, you never needed to really touch the "stock vs flow" issue, you just had to make sure your definitions were consistent. 

Neither American nor World economy will collapse as long as there at least two citizens producing goods and willing to exchange them. Roman Empire's economy did not collapse either, for the record, the Empire did. In any economy some jobs and sectors become obsolete, others take over and attract a lot of capital. At some point of the 20th century the car industry was booming and made Detroit the richest city in America. Then manufacturing jobs got outsourced and now the US economy strives creating IT products. Rich people rely on ordinary people's income and spending to maintain their wealth. It is the average people who buy products made by the rich people's firms and make them rich in the first place. It is the average people who produce goods and services that the rich people buy with their dollars. Also, the democratic political system of a country is centered around the median voter, the ordinary guy . If the tax and wealth redistribution policies favor rich too much, people will vote for more redistribution of wealth. This ensures resilience and sustainability of modern democracies, something the Roman Empire did not have. There is a balance, or equilibrium, between how much capital the rich get rewarded for their contributions to society and how much an average Joe earns on the average job. In this equilibrium there are very rich, there are poor, and there are unemployed. Sometimes, it may seem, rich become too rich and there are too many poor. 

Interesting observation, but I think the answer is partly explained by several factors: First, any calculation of real GDP would eliminate the year-over-year variance that could be due to taste shocks leading to significant price changes. Second, I think your observation is partially true, however. What makes an iPhone more valuable than an old Motorola smartphone? Sure, some inputs might be slightly different, but the "production technology" of the iPhone makes it such that we (in general) do value it higher. While some measures like CPI try to account for some of those issues by considering benchmarks for certain performance criteria (like processing power, memory, etc.), in the end, there absolutely is some taste-based component. I think it's partly accounted for by aggregation, as you mentioned, but I think the third point is that there's a bit of a disconnect between what value is trying to measure, and what GDP is interested in. Theories of value attempt to explain why we attach certain "utility amounts" to different goods. But that doesn't mean the output of any particular "theory of value" is subjective: the observed prices and quantities are quite objective. GDP (like other macroeconomic indicators) is more interested in tabulating those objective outputs of the theory of value and observing their change over time. For example, I know I value the green mechanical pencil in front of me at \$2, despite the fact I only paid \$1 for it. Assuming the production costs are negligible, GDP would observe that as \$1 of economic activity. It doesn't consider how much I would have paid for it, which is what different theories of value attempt to explain. Furthermore, why I value it at \$2 might be for any host of reasons- perhaps its a subjective value, or perhaps that valuation reflects what I think the pencil will be worth in a year's time. Regardless of what that reasoning is, the objective measurements that GDP considers are the price paid and quantity. 

Well, if not for differences in energy efficiency, GDP would be determined by energy consumption. In a globalized world most businesses and countries have similar energy efficiencies, and if they do differ, poor countries have consistently lower energy efficiency. This preserves a neat correlation between GDP and energy consumption. There is so much empirical evidence of it that it is pretty much a rule. You can browse Google image search to see the evidence of it. Many poor countries lack statistical apparatus to measure their GDP and use data like electricity consumption to estimate their GDP every year. 

Nice question! I would like to add a few elusive ones that I think are important. Natural selection does not require intelligence. It is more of a biology theory, but its economic implications are vast. Evolution of cooperation is very useful but often ignored by economists and politicians as it goes against some common sense rules. The entire theory of probability is counter-intuitive and has plenty of traps in economics for those who use only common sense. One example is a Monty Hall paradox: once you made your decision with limited information, you will gain by changing your decision when you get more information. A common fallacy of "throwing good money after bad" stems from ignoring this principle. Literally everyone has been guilty of it. 

There are a few reasons why, at least in a broader theoretical context, substantial government influence in a market economy may have negative consequences. A few are: Crowding Out Effect Increases in government spending can potentially lead to a decrease in investment from the private sector. This can be thought of in the more formal definition of the term (that an increase in government demands for loanable funds can lead to an increase in the interest rates faced by the private sector) or in the more informal one- that government involvement can change the profit motive faced by private entities in the field. If you assume that those private firms are, on balance, more efficient with resources than the governmental agency, it can lead to negative economic outcomes. Market Distortions One potential problem of increased governmental activity in the economy comes from unforeseen distortions that can ripple through other sectors. For all their problems, one nice feature of market equilibria are their ability to reflect private information and demands, and aggregate the individual actions of hundreds of millions of people effectively. That is no small feat; it is hard for a centralized agency to mimic that effectiveness. One of the major problems with centralized economies in practice is their practical inability to allocate resources "efficiently." Modeling government interaction in a repeated game-like context. Another (albeit more philosophical) problem some see is that, even if a larger government would be optimal for right now, it is often difficult to cut bureaucracy once it becomes entrenched. Therefore, we should consider that "future value" of inefficiently large government spending in the future (even if it is optimal to increase government's size today) into today's perceived "payoffs" of different actions. Problems with the Multiplier Effect: The multiplier, as learned in econ101, is a bit oversimplified in its presentation. While there almost certainly is some multiplier in every case, it isn't really just a single number that turns on an economy wide "marginal propensity to consume." Instead, it's far more subtle, and often depends on who is receiving the benefit, what the context of the payment is, etc. Furthermore, some conservative economists argue it is often too small to justify the expense. Now, note that I personally don't really believe much of what was said above. I'm not trying to suggest that Mr. Corbyn should or shouldn't increase the size of government expenditures (I haven't studied the issue enough to make an informed opinion). Furthermore, I think it should be noted (in the interest of fairness) that many times these theoretical concerns can be misapplied in practice: for example, The Laffer Curve may be the most poorly applied theoretical concept in political economy. Let me know if that didn't answer your question, or if you'd like more detail! 

If it is about European Union, it would make sense to look at austerity as a response to the debt crisis. I would measure austerity not as the level of government debt, but as the change in levels of government debt from year to year. The slower the government debt (as a share of GDP) increases, the more austere are the budget policies of that country. Also, if you have access to state budget deficits data, it would be a very convincing measure of austerity in my opinion. The less is the budget deficit, the more austere is the budget policy. 

Very unlikely. Terrorism events are not economically significant enough to move a commodity like gold. In fact, terrorist attacks only effect markets if they are likely to lead to a major economy entering a full-scale war like it was after 9/11, 2001. The cost of terrorism, while at historical height, is still very small to effect the markets significantly: $URL$ Even economy of a country like France that have been recently hit by a terrorist attack is not likely to be affected by it too much. Politicians may exploit the terrorist attack to push their agenda though, which may have negative effects on the economy, like this articles argues: $URL$ Yet, gold is a very volatile market and the price of gold can move a lot in any direction for no obvious reason. Purchases and sales of gold by central banks and institutional investors often go unannounced. Another thing you should keep in mind if you want to speculate on the rate hike is that some big players may be waiting for that moment to BUY gold in large amounts, because that is when they can expect the most people placing sell orders. In that case the price of gold can jump contrary to expectations. 

There are likely two major (and closely related) reasons for this: First- stock prices aren't purely reflective of what a company is worth today, instead, stock prices reflect the expected future prices as well. Events like this, which increase uncertainty and instability, might change expectations about future stock prices. This is then incorporated into current stock prices, which leads to a fall. Second- a lot of automated trading algorithms incorporate news keywords into their pricing structures (for example), which can lead to reactions based on the headlines themselves. These can then create a feedback loop with other funds, like ETFs, which trade based on volatility indexes. I'm sure there are other reasons as well, (perhaps the breakdown in the summit led some traders to reevaluate the relative bargaining power of the US and China in their upcoming summit, which in their mind might lead to an increased likelihood of a trade war, as a hypothetical), though those two can explain many large fluctuations! 

There is a broad literature that attempts to address the very question you pose- what is the impact of immigration (legal and illegal) on native wages? However, if you're interested in the 'real world' evidence, I'd suggest focusing on empirical labor economics as opposed to more theoretical labor models. The reason for my suggestion is that theoretical economics makes no clear prediction without a lot more information. There are a variety of factors, such as the production function being considered, the labor market conditions observed, the relative substitutability of immigrant and native workers, etc. which tends to make answering the question more of an empirical exercise. As far as the findings of the empirical papers, they actually tend to find relatively little impact of immigrant labor on native wages, with a few notable exceptions. For some examples: This survey paper, though a bit out of date as it's from 2005 outlines the results of 18 papers and finds wide discrepancies depending on modeling techniques and underlying assumptions used. Borjas, 2003 is one of the better known works, and finds what one might expect based on Econ101 models- that an increase in immigrant labor supply leads to a decrease in wages for native workers. A couple very well known articles have tried to tease out the impact of immigration on wages by focusing on particular events (called supply shocks) where the number of immigrants increased "suddenly" for reasons having nothing to do with the economic climate at the time. A pair of papers examined the impact of the Mariel Boatlift, which led to a spike in Cuban immigrants in Miami: The first, a paper by Card 1990 found no evidence of a negative impact of immigration on wages, while Borjas 2015 finds a substantial decrease in the wages for the least educated Miami residents. Several other papers have found either no negative effect, or even positive effects, of immigrants on various worker wages. For example, this paper by Peri in 2011 finds no negative impact of immigrants on wages, but a strongly positive impact of immigrants on productivity. This paper from 2013 finds significant positive impacts of undocumented immigrants on the wages of native workers in Georgia. Ultimately, the exercise of determining the impact of immigrants on wages really depends on the method of analysis and a number of underlying parameters, and applying "standard" (i.e. Principles of Micro) models can lead to erroneous results and a false sense of certainty. If there's anything else in particular you're interested in, let me know and I'll try to improve the answer! EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to include a link to this additional survey paper in the original answer! 

Yuan will certainly appear in the reserves of oil exporting countries. The question is how much of it? China still has many problems with its currency and a long way to go until it becomes as appealing as dollar or even Japanese yen. Whether countries include a currency in their reserve basket ultimately depends on how predictable and stable it is compare to other currencies. It is also preferred that the currency appreciates in the long term. Living in China myself and holding my savings in yuan, I try to keep an eye on factors and risks that may move it up or down in medium to long term. Here are the most important in my opinion: Upside: 

My guess is because they are denominated is Euros and their yields respond to the European Central Bank monetary policy decisions. 

It depends on what they mine there and how big are the layoffs. Boomtowns are usually formed when they set up mines in remote regions. After the mines are depleted or become economically non-viable, workers leave and the boomtown becomes a ghost town. Since the economy of such places heavily relies on income from mining, it cannot survive once the money stop flowing. You can read up on the history of boomtowns and ghost towns on wikipedia to see if that is what you are looking for. Boomtowns: $URL$ Ghost towns: $URL$
