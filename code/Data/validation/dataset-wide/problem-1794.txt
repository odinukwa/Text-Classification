That depends on the particular group of servers you're looking at. It could be Ethernet, Infiniband, FibreChannel, fiber optics -- practically anything connecting the servers together. Usually servers perform distinct tasks unless you are really talking about a cluster designed to be a supercomputer (though VMWare & friends has blurred that line recently because a given workload can be moved around between different physical servers with impunity). Applications which wish to make full use of the processing power offered by that many machines needs to be specifically engineered to allow distributed computing of that sort -- they operate just as if you'd install that application on hundreds of desktop machines. Really, there's little difference between desktop hardware and server hardware except that server hardware is much more expensive, and much more reliable, and much faster. 

Google uses Round Robin DNS. Essentially, Google's DNS server changes the address it gives you based on your location. 

I have a Windows 7 machine, which I would like to use to manage Hyper-V on a Windows Server 2008 R2 machine. A while ago there was a reference to Hyper V Manager MMC on the Windows Visualization blog, but the links are now dead. Can this be done? Billy3 

I recently decided to include a great system stats plugins with every wordpress install. LINK: $URL$ One of the features of this plugin provides a tab where it analyses specific php/server settings and suggests changes. What I am curious about is what you expert feel are the correct settings for some errors its spitting out at me. These include: open_basedir Out of ALL php settings I seem to always run into issues with plugin installs and even file uploads or plugin installs whenever this is set to a value so I have always set this to "none". What I would like to know is what the ideal value is for this php directive and how important you guys think it is to set this to a value other than "none". As far as I am aware it limits the PHP process from accessing files outside of the specified directories. It is strongly suggested that you set open_basedir to your web site documents and shared libraries only. safe_mode Interestingly, I have always felt this setting to be set to "ON" for security reasons but interestingly, this plugin is saying that this feature is depreciated in PHP 5.3 and is removed in PHP 6.0. Relying on this feature is architecturally incorrect, as this should not be solved at the PHP level. What are you opinions on this? ServerSignature I have this set to "ON" and this plugin claims that by setting this to on it means that your server software version, and other important details are public, which can give hackers information necessary to exploit version and software-specific vulnerabilities. If I set this to off are you guys aware of any issues this might have? allow_url_fopen I currently have these set to ON but the suggestion is to disable allow_url_fopen for security reasons. How do you guys feel about this? Apparently with this set to on it allows PHP file functions, such as include, require, and file_get_contents(), to retrieve data from remote locations (Example: FTP, web site). According to PHP Security Consortium, a large number of code injection vulnerabilities are caused by the combination of enabling allow_url_fopen, and bad input filtering. mod_security I don't have this installed because I alway seem to run into some types of issues with it. What are your opinions on this? 

DD-WRT supports Chillspot: $URL$ I believe you need to setup a RADIUS server to make full use of it though. 

I have a setup here with a single domain controller and 4 servers which were whithin it's domain. The servers were brought down and are being repurposed, but we would like to keep backups of the machines around. I am going through one by one and taking the backups, which requires that I login to these machines. I've been able to login to all the servers, except the domain controller. The domain controller itself seems to have not started all it's active directory services, and when one tries to login, it complains that the . How can I login to this box? Billy3 

Some great helpers here have shown me the VMWare OVF tool for template deployment. My problem is that the tool itself stops at the "Disk Transfer Completed" step half the time I use it. This seems to be random, and when it happens I have to terminate OVFTool and start the transfer over again. The second attempt usually succeeds. Is there something I have broken on the server that might affect this? I'm using the free edition of ESXi 4.0. Billy3 EDIT: This is how ovftool is being run: 

AWS VPN in Virginia goes down. All the traffic from my office route to AWS VPN connection LINE 1 in . So if I ping now from my office to it will be route to Ireland VPN. 4.but the VPC in Ireland with . 

I want to make sure that if one of the vpn connections/lines goes down, I will still be able to access the aws region via the other VPN in the other aws region. For example if goes down, automatically all the traffic from my office to will go to and from there it will route to with my IPSec instance, like nothing happen. example: if goes down: As I said I have connection between my regions with IPSec instances. My question is, if VPN connection LINE 2 goes down, all the traffic to will route automatically from my office to , but I guess the will reject them because the IPs are not in the same network of . So I wonder what are my options (without removing my current AWS VPN) ? To be more specific, how I can route traffic from IPs (lets say for example ) via Ireland VPN connection (when Virginia VPN connection goes down), to , but the IPs that I route are not in the same network ? The question refers only to AWS side, after I route the traffic from my office. I will be happy to answer any questions if my question is not understandable. Thanks in advance!! UPDATE - I will try to be more specific with my question: 

I have a problem which is driving me and a few clients on this server totally nuts. The problem is that PHP (or I guess Apache) seems to be crashing randomly and almost on a daily basis. The dedicated server I have is running Linux and Plesk 9.5 and has 1gb of ram and is only really running 5 websites which don't get a significant amount of traffic. I have gone through the httpd error_log as the web host suggested and I did find a bunch of issues being reported by php for each of the 5 wordpress 3.0 sites. Mainly related to missing php include files and things like that all which I ended up resolving. Unfortunately, none of the issue I fixed seem to have been related to apache crashing so my question to you guys here is what do I do next. Naturally I would like to know exactly why this is happening so I can not only resolve this problem right now but also know how to correctly diagnose a problem like this in the future. My web hosts solution was to just add more ram but although this "may" be the actual reason I can't believe these 5 sites are sucking so much ram. In any case I am just looking for the exact steps you experts would use to diagnose and resolve this. Additionally - Below I have included a few bullet points for other unresolved errors listed within my errors_log file as I don't know if any of this is helpful.
