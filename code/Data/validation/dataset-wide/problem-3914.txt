Suppose $(A,\mathfrak{a})$ and $(B,\mathfrak{b})$ are two adically complete (commutative) noetherian rings. Let $f:A \to B$ be a continuous formally smooth formally of finite type map (that is, $B/\mathfrak{b}$ is a finitely generated $A$-algebra). In this case it is proved in EGA IV that $\Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}} \Omega^1_{B/A}$ is a projective module of finite rank, where $\Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}}$ denotes the $\mathfrak{b}$-adic completion functor. In a (not nessecerily) adic case, if $f:A \to B$ is formally smooth and of finite type, it is proved that there that $f$ is actually smooth, so that letting $I = \ker (B\otimes_A B \to B)$, we have that $I$ is locally generated by a regular sequence (from which it follows that $\Omega^1_{B/A} \cong I/I^2$ is locally free). Now, to my question: Again, assume we are in the adic case as above. As seen above, the module of Kähler differentials, $\Omega^1_{B/A}$ is no longer the "correct" object, but its completion is. Set $\mathfrak{b}^e = \mathfrak{b} \otimes_A B + B \otimes_A \mathfrak{b} \subseteq B\otimes_A B$, and let $J = \ker( \Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}^e} B\otimes_A B \to B)$. Then we have that $J/J^2 \cong \Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}} \Omega^1_{B/A}$. Is it true that $J$ is locally generated by a regular sequence? that is, is the map $\Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}^e} B\otimes_A B \to B$ a regular immersion? Thanks! 

In general, if $A$ is a commutative ring and $I$ is a finitely generated ideal in $A$, given an $I$-adically complete $A$-module $M$, and a multiplicative set $S \subseteq A$, when working in the adic category, one usually replaces the usual localization $S^{-1}M$ by exactly what you described - the complete localization $\Lambda_I (S^{-1}M)$ where $\Lambda_I$ is the completion functor. This behaves in many ways like the usual localization. For example, in ring theory a module $M$ is the zero module if and only if $M_p = 0$ for all $p \in Spec A$. If $A$ and $M$ are $I$-adically complete, one may replace this operation by the complete localization, and show that such a complete module $M$ is zero if and only if for all open primes $p$, one has that $\Lambda_I(M_p) = 0$. (Note that this is false if $M$ is not complete. For example, any injective module $J$ will have that $\Lambda_I(J_p)=0$). Well, if you want to continue working with the ideal-theoretic stuff, I suppose you can cheat, view such a module $M$ as a $k[[x]]$-module (under the forgetful functor), and still demand your module to be $(x)$-adically complete. 

Let $X$ be a compact Shimura curve. If we remove finitely many points from this curve, do we neccessarily get a "non-compact Shimura curve"? I have some reasons to believe that the answer is negative, but don't have a proof nor a counter example. However if the answer is really No, does there exist a well-known structure / property for this punctured Shimura curve? 

This must be an easy question but I don't have a good argument for it and have not found a counterexample: Let $G$ be a connected semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}$ such that the center of $G$, $Z(G)$ is trivial, i.e. $Z(G)=\{1\}$ is it true that the center of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$, denoted $Z(G_{\mathbb{R}})$ is also trivial? 

I asked this question already in mathstackexchange but got no answer, so I ask it again here. Let $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ be the Siegel upper half space, i.e., the set of complex symmetric $g\times g$ matrices with positive-definite imaginary part. Royden in his article "inavariant metrics on Teichmüller space" gives the inifinitesimal form of the Kobayashi distance (metric) on $\mathbb{H}_{g}$ as the operator norm $\frac{1}{2}||Y^{-1/2} dZ Y^{-1/2}||$. My question is what is the Kobayashi distance between two given points on $\mathbb{H}_{g}$? For example, when $g=1$, (i.e., $\mathbb{H}_{g}=\mathbb{H}_{1}$ is the upper half plane) it is well-konwn that the Kobayashi distance (finite version of the Kobayashi metric given above) between $z$ and $w$ in $\mathbb{H}$ is the usual hyperbolic distance $d_{\mathbb{H}}(z,w)$. What is the generalization of this to the upper half space? 

The first mathematician who talked about groups of points on elliptic curves (in the sense of Galois, i.e., in the modern sense of the word group) was Juel [Ueber die Parameterbestimmung von Punkten auf Curven zweiter und dritter Ordnung. Eine geometrische Einleitung in die Theorie der logarithmischen und elliptischen Funktionen, Math. Ann. 47 (1896), 72-104]. Poincare, in his important article referred to by ThiKu, does not use the concept of groups (this is the point of Schappacher's article). Even Mordell proved his theorem, namely that the group of rational points on an elliptic curve is finitely generated, without using the notion of a group: this was only done by Weil. For a long time, most people interested in elliptic curves regarded them as a variety of diophantine equations, and preferred thinking about secant and tangent methods instead of group operations. Only when it became clear in the 1960s that the rank of an elliptic curve could be computed by applying all kinds of homomorphisms and determining the orders of kernels and images of such homomorphisms, the group theoretic point of view became indispensible. 

$f = 1$. In this case, $L/k$ is unramified and $\ell \mid h(K)$ since $L/k$ is an abelian unramified extension- If $f$ is divisible by some prime number $p \equiv 1 \bmod \ell$, let $F$ denote the subfield of degree $\ell$ in the field of $p$-th roots of unity. By Abhyankar's Lemma, the extensions $KF/K$ and $LF/L$ are unramified and abelian, so $\ell \mid h(K)$. $f$ is only divisible by primes $p \equiv -1 \bmod \ell$ that remain inert in $k/{\mathbb Q}$. We assume that $\ell \nmid h(k)$ and have to show that $\ell \mid h(K)$. The ambiguous class number formula tells us that $\# Am(L/k) = \ell^{t-1}/(E_k:E_k \cap NL^\times)$, where $t$ is the number of primes dividing $f$, and where $E_k$ is the unit group of $k$. The number of strongly ambiguous ideals (those generated by ideals fixed by $\sigma$) is given by $\# Am_{st}(L/k) = \ell^{t-1}/(E_k: NE_L)$. If $\ell > 3$, or if $\ell = 3$ and $k \ne {\mathbb Q}(\sqrt{-3}\,)$, then the index $(E_k:E_k \cap NL^\times) = 1$ because $E_k = \{-1, +1\}$ and these are norms of units. Thus there must be at least two primes dividing $f$. But then the number of strongly ambiguous ideal classes is $\# Am_{st}(L/k) = \ell^{t-1}$ since the index $(E_k:NE_L) = 1$. Thus there is a strongly ambiguous ideal class of order $\ell$ generated by a prime ideal above one of the primes dividing $f$. But then the prime ideal in $K$ above this prime $p$ cannot be principal, hence has order $\ell$, and we conclude that $\ell \mid h(K)$. 

Assume $I$ is generated by $a_1,\dots,a_n$ (the cohomological dimension is $\ge$ the number of generators, so let's assume they are equal). Let $C = C(a_1,\dots,a_n)$ be the Cech complex. Then, since $R$ is noetherian, for any complex $M$, we have that: $R\Gamma_I M \cong C \otimes_R M$. Thus, we want to calculate $H^n(C\otimes_R M)$. As the cohomology of $C$ is supported in $[0,n]$, there is an isomorphism (See for example Lemma 15.3.6 of $URL$ $H^n(C\otimes_R M) \cong H^n(C\otimes^L_R M) \cong H^n(C) \otimes_R H^0(M)$ And this is simply $H^n_I(R) \otimes_R M$. 

If you are willing to assume that: 1) $A$ has a dualizing complex $R$. 2) $A\otimes_k A$ is noetherian of finite Krull dimension. Then the answer is yes: One can show that under these conditions, $R\otimes_k R$ is a dualizing complex over $A\otimes_k A$. Now, a finitely generated module $M\otimes_k M$ has finite injective dimension if and only if its dual $RHom_{A\otimes_k A}(M\otimes_k M, R\otimes_k R) \cong RHom_A(M,R)\otimes_k RHom_A(M,R)$ has finite projective dimension, and this is easy to verify. 

It is well known that the function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ has no elementary anti-derivative. The proof I know goes as follows: Let $F = \mathbb{C}(X)$. Let $F \subseteq E$ be the Picard-Vessiot extension for a suitable homogeneous differential equation for which $f$ is a solution. Then one may calculate $G(E/F)$ and show it is connected and not abelian. On the other hand, a calculation shows that if $K$ is a differential field extension of $F$ generated by elementary functions then the connected component of $G(K/F)$ is abelian, so it is impossible for an anti-derivative of $f$ to be contained in such a field $K$. However, in classical Galois theory we can do much better, there, we know that a polynomial equation is solvable by radicals if and only if the corresponding Galois group is solvable. So to my question - is an analog of this is available in differential Galois theory? Is there a general method to determine by properties of $G(F/E)$ if $F$ is contained in a field of elementary functions? 

If $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is a cyclic cover of $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ with Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ and thus with the (affine) formula $y^{m}= (x_{1}-a_{1})^{t_{1}}....(x_{n}-a_{n})^{t_{n}}$ there is a Galois group decomposition on the cohomolgy $H^{1}(C, \mathbb{C})$ (or more generally on the sheaf $R^{1} \pi_{*} \mathbb{C}$ ) and the dimension of the eigenspace with respect to the character $j \in \mathbb{Z}/m \mathbb{Z}$ is given by the formula $-1+ \sum_{i=1}^n < jt_{i}/m> $ (where $< x>$ denotes the franctional part of the number $x$ ) . Now if the Galois group of the covering $\pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{P}^{1}$ is not cyclic, is there a formula that computes the dimension of the eigenspaces? Or generally how can one compute the dimension of the eigenspaces? For simplicity you can always assume that the covering $\pi$ is abelian (i.e. the Galois group is abelian) and thereof the fiber product of cyclic covers. 

I am trying to understand the Segal-Sugawara construction from the book "vertex algebras and algebraic curves" by Frenkel, Ben-Zvi in 3.4.8. As an absolute layman in the area of mathematical physics and vertex algebras, I have difficulties to understand the arguments there, as it seems many details in the proof have been omitted. More concretely, the computations of $S_n.J^{b}_{-1}v_k$ for $n=-1,0,1$ are still obscure for me. Could anyone explain these computations with more details? 

If $f: X \rightarrow C$ is the universal family of false elliptic curves (i.e. abelian surfaces $A$ such that $End(A) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a totally indefinite quaternion algebra over $\mathbb{Q}$), then $C$ is a Shimura curve. My question is : How does the the variation of Hodge structures(VHS) of this universal family look like? Of course I know that for any family of abelian varieties over a Shimura curve, the VHS has the form $R^{1}f_{*}\mathbb{C}= (\mathbb{L} \otimes \mathbb{T}) \bigoplus \mathbb{U}$ where $\mathbb{U}$ and $\mathbb{T}$ are unitary and $\mathbb{L}$ is uniformizing, but I want a more specific description in the case of a universal family of false elliptic curves. 

If $N \varepsilon = -1$, then the ideals $(2b_i + \sqrt{m},a_i)$ represent the different ideal classes of order dividing $2$ (I am using equivalence in the usual (wide) sense), and each such ideal class is represented exactly once in this way. Moreover, each ideal is equivalent to exactly one ramified ideal (i.e. a product of distinct ramified prime ideals). If $N \varepsilon = +1$, then the ideals $(2b_i + \sqrt{m},a_i)$ represent exactly those ideal classes of order $2$ that are not represented by a ramified ideal, and each ideal has two such representations. 

Cubes in ${\mathbb Z}[\rho]$ are $\equiv 0, 1 \bmod 2$ by Fermat's Little Theorem. Thus $0 \equiv \alpha \equiv \beta + \gamma \equiv \rho^b + \rho^c \bmod 2$, which implies $b = c$. Since $\alpha\beta\gamma$ is a cube, we must have $a = b = c = 0$. Thus $$ \alpha = 2 A_1^3, \quad \beta = B_1^3, \quad \gamma = C_1^3. $$ Since $B_1^3 \equiv C_1^3 \equiv 1 \bmod 2$, we may assume that $B_1 \equiv C_1 \equiv 1 \bmod 2$ (after multiplying these numbers through by a suitable power of $\rho$). Now set $\alpha_1 = B_1 + C_1$, $\beta_1 = \rho B_1 + \rho^2 C_1$ and $\gamma_1 = \rho^2 B_1 + \rho C_1$. Then 

I certainly have read a lot of classics, and have learned a lot (mostly about historical developments) even from Euclid's elements. When it comes to research mathematics, I'd at least like to mention that Weil got the idea for the Weil conjectures from reading Gauss's articles on biquadratic residues. As an example more in line with the question let me add that, in a letter to Goldbach dated April 15, 1749, Euler mentions that he has found, after quite some effort, a parametrized solution of the equation $xyz(x+y+z) = a$. Elkies found a way of deriving Euler's solution and found a simpler one, using methods from modern algebraic geometry. How Euler found his solution is still open.
