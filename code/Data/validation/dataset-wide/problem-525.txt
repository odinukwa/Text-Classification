I've looked online, but haven't found one. Is there any sort of "matrix" available that puts shift lever boss type on one axis and shift lever on the other, and remarks on each pair's compatibility? Ideally, this would include bosses that include the following (and any others that might be useful): downtube braze on, downtube clamped on, barend "pods", "thumbie pods", stem-mounted. Each type on each axis would be collapsed based on same-shape/same-size with some notes on which specific items fall into each type category. So, something like this: 

Use the old style seatpost that ends in a nub. Attach your saddle to an old style saddle clamp. Replace the bolt on the saddle clamp with some quick-release bolt or winged/knobbed bolt. The saddle and clamp might separate on loosening and removal, however. See if a removable seatpost head clamp would attach to a nub-ended seat tube. Maybe you'd have to saw the end of a seat tube that fits, and find a removable seatpost head clamp that fits the correct diameter. The advantage with this is that the head would clamp to your saddle separately from clamping to the seat tube. Perhaps modify the clamp so that it is quick-release by adding your own QR collar or replacing a bolt. These types seem to be related to "integrated" seatposts. Another one. Also, search for Cannondale Synapse seatpost clamp. 

I want to buy a threaded headset for an old road frame that takes 1 inch threaded steerer tube / headsets. I see headsets for sale online that are labeled as "1 inch threaded BMX headset". Is there any compatibility issue with trying to install it on a road bike? What about non-BMX-labeled headsets being installed on BMX frames? I figure I can get a headset a little bit cheaper if I could use one that is labeled as "BMX". 

Use tubes to make U-locks (or anything) less prone to scratching your frame. My U-lock's base has bare metal which scratches my frame. I cut the circular tube to make it one straight tube. Then I lay one end along the metal of the base of the U-lock. Then I wrapped it tight around itself as if I was wrapping handlebar tape. Then on the last wrap I left it slightly looser so I could put the loose end underneath the last wrap and then I pulled it tight. It stays put fine. You can slip a section of tube over the "U" of the U-lock and then roll up the ends (like shirt sleeves) so it keeps it in place. 

Context: I have a commuter/crossover bike with disc brakes, and a daily commute of ~20km. I upgraded to a bike with disc brakes after standard caliper brakes kept losing their stick and requiring pad replacements, as my rims became coated with oil from the roads (I commute past a diesel truck depot, and the road is nasty for about 1km). Problem: Since I upgraded, I have the opposite problem: literally every day in the winter, my disc brakes get full of mud, road salt, and sand. That stuff gets on top of and behind the (magnetically attached) brake pads, and makes them drag on the rotor. At best, they make the brakes constantly pull as if they were about 1/2 engaged. At worst, the water in the mud freezes and expands over night (I have a tiny apartment, and the bike sleeps outside), and the brakes are completely locked in the morning. What I've Tried: At first I thought it was the cables that were freezing with tension on the brakes, but after replacing and oiling them, I isolated the problem to the brake rotors/pads themselves. The roads where I live are pretty much always covered in debris all winter, so changing my commute to avoid that stuff doesn't really work. I've tried adjusting the brake pads farther away from the rotors. This works a little, but to fully prevent sticking, I have to adjust the pads so far out that I can't fully engage the brakes when I want to. Up until now, I've been washing the bike with water every night (annoying, since during the winter the outside faucets don't work), and rinsing the brakes with warm water every morning to unfreeze them. Question: This is getting really old, so my question is: without obsessively cleaning them 1-2 times a day, how do I keep my disc brakes from getting gummed up? If the answer is "buy better disc brakes", that's fine. I just have no idea what to look for. 

I've had one Kryptonite D-lock for the last two years, and it's worked great. I typically don't ride with a pack, so I've used lock mounts (this kind) to keep it secured to the upright on my bike. However, the lock mounts keep breaking from use after a few months: either the plastic shears off, the "lock-in-place" toggle gets stuck open, the strap breaks, or the tensioner screw's head snaps off some day when I'm trying to wrestle my lock out of the mount. What kinds of lock mount exist that are durable? If none exists, how would you suggest rigging some mounting solution by hand? I'm tired of buying new lock mounts, and don't like to lock around the frame of my bike: doing that over the long term has destroyed the paint on the bottom of my Y-brace and rattles around in my knees while I ride. 

Where is the ideal / designed location for my sit bones to push on a leather sling/hammock style saddle? (Relative positioning, that works for any saddle width) While I'm riding on my leather saddle, I notice that my sit bones seem to press the saddle very close to the rear metal part of the saddle (i.e. near the rivets). This metal bar with the rivets is U-shaped, with the tails curving forwards at each side. Are my sit bones supposed to fit within the curve? In front of it? Referring to the grid below, my intuition is that I should get a wider saddle with a wider metal U such that my sit bones are in the relative locations of: center-of (C-D,2-3) and center-of (C-D,4-5). Am I correct that the U should "cradle" my sit bones? (Also, I notice most leather saddles use 6 rivets in the rear, so we can refer to them as rivet #1 through #6.) 

I have not tried any of these suggestions myself. You may want to look into a seatpost that is just a tube, and a seat clamp that, itself, clamps to the seat tube. All these ideas depend on sourcing parts that fit your seat tube diameter, of course: 

You may be able to use a "seatpost shim" that converts you folding bike's seat tube inner diameter to a different inner diameter. That way you would open up options for buying a better/different seatpost that actually has a modern clamp (mounting apparatus) at the top. Your linked replacement says that post has an outer diameter (OD) of 34.1mm and 550mm long. Maybe one of these "Wheels Manufacturing" shims could fit to convert it. There is one listed that is slightly off: it is listed as 34.0mm taking it down to either 27.2mm or 30.9mm. Then, for example, there are 27.2mm diameter seatposts that are 400mm long that include the clamp apparatus at the top. (I have not tried this setup before, so do not know it will work. Also, if the 400mm long seatpost would be too short, then this clearly won't work out for you. If you had the original seatpost pushed down much more than 150mm / 6 inches then it should work. It is a big difference between 400mm and 550mm.) 

I have 1990s Shiman Deore XT cantilever brake pad holder shoes with smooth studs. I believe these are "M Type" cartridges/inserts. The replaceable inserts slide in and are held in place by a screw / grub. They look like this: 

As you can see, the winners' average speeds in the 1970's and 1980's were below trend, while speeds in the 1960's, 1990's and 2000's were above the long-term trend. So, even if the long-term trend in speeds can mostly be explained by Tour length (the correlation between Tour length and winner's speed is about 0.8), some have pointed to this secondary effect in the residuals as further evidence of doping. However, there are two counter-arguments, one slightly weaker and one very much stronger. The weaker argument is based on the observation that the residuals are "double-peaked" and speeds in the 1960's were also higher than the trend, then dropped in the 1970's and 1980's. If doping were the simple explanation, one would have to explain the drop in the 1970's and 1980's, not just the rise in the 1990's and 2000's. However, the stronger argument is based on examining data from other races and comparing them to the Tour. If one were to examine the residuals from a similar plot of speed vs. distance for the Giro and Vuelta, one would see that the years when their speeds were above (or below) their own trend lines did not correspond with the same years for the Tour. That is, the speed residual for the Tour and the speed residuals for the Giro or Vuelta are not "synchronized." Thus, if doping behavior explained the reason why Tour speeds were higher than would be predicted from distance, then one would have to explain why doping behavior was different in the Tour and Giro (or Vuelta) in the same year, often with the same riders. Below I include a plot that shows the "residuals" from the Tour (that is, residuals from the regression of winner's average speed on Tour length) plotted against the same residuals for the Giro. This does not mean, of course, that there is no doping in either the Tour or the Giro -- it simply means that one cannot use average speeds as evidence of that doping. Conversely, it also means that one cannot use doping as an explanation for increased average speed. Taken together, it does support the evidence that race organizers's decisions about the routes is a main determinant of the average speed. 

As noted above, part of the ranking of a climb depends on its placement within a stage: usually, the ending climb of a stage gets "bumped up" by a category. You can see that in the plots below, which show climbs as categorized by the organizers of the Tour de France itself for the 2012, 2007, 2005, and 2004 editions of the Tour, and plotted by the length of the climb and its average gradient. If given the length of the climb and gradient, you can calculate the total elevation change for that climb, and the dotted contour lines in each plot show that. Cat 2, 1, and HC climbs are named. For example, in 2004 the Vilard de Lans climb was classified at a Cat 2 climb rather than (evidently) a Cat 3 because it was the end of the stage. Similarly, in 2005 the climb to Pla d'Adet ended the stage, and it appears that its category was also increased from (arguably) Cat 1 to HC. As an aside, the Madeleine was climbed in both 2004 and 2005 but, as you can see, the length and gradient of the climbs were different in those years. In 2004, the Madeleine was climbed from the southern side; in 2005 and 2012, the approach to the Madeleine was from the north.
