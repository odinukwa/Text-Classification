The "golden rule" is the level at which steady-state consumption is at a maximum, given the parameters of the model. Steady state consumption is $$c^* = (1-s^*)\cdot f[k^*(s^*)] = f[k^*(s^*)] - s^*f[k^*(s^*)] \tag{1}$$ where $0<s^*<1$ We also have that, at the steady state (for constant capital) $$s^*f[k^*(s^*)] = \delta k^*(s^*) \tag{2}$$ Inserting $(2)$ in $(1)$, $$c^* = f[k^*(s^*)] - \delta k^*(s^*) \tag{3}$$ We want to maximize steady-state consumption, so we take the first derivative and set it equal to zero, $$\frac {\partial c^*}{\partial s^*} = f'[k^*(s^*)]\cdot \frac {{\rm d}k^*}{{\rm d}s^*} - \delta \frac {{\rm d}k^*}{{\rm d}s^*} =0 $$ $$\implies \big(f'[k^*(s^*)]\ - \delta \big)\frac {{\rm d}k^*}{{\rm d}s^*} =0 \implies f'[k^*(s^*)] = \delta \tag{4} $$ From the production function we have $$f'(k) = \frac 1{\sqrt {k}} = \delta \implies k^* = \frac 1 {\delta^2}$$ The rest are evident. 

I recently watched again the Dark Night movie and refreshed the game in question. First it is clear in the dialogues that beliefs on the other group's ranking of outcomes and intentions are updated as time passes (and the more time passes the more each group believes that the other group won't push the button). Second, what I believe would be interesting here is to determine what kind of preferences and beliefs must be in place in order to experience the outcome seen in the movie: neither group pushes the button, meaning that they accept to die rather than kill the other group, with perhaps some hope (some strictly positive probability) that the Joker's assertion of blowing both up may be a bluff. I think an important aspect is what happens to the boat with the civilians: they take a vote in order to decide (i.e. a collective action), and decide to push the button. But then, the burden is down to a single person to do it, and we see that, even though the vote has taken the burden of decision of the individual back, no one can do it -perhaps because he feels that he will kill many people to save just himself (not the group). The individualistic experience of performing the final dreadful act appears to be a strong deterrent, and this act is not seen as just the procedural step of a collective decision but something that bears a special burden, a burden that even a person that voted "yes" to push the button cannot bear. The group voted to kill in order to survive - but there is no single person in that group that can execute this decision. So it is not even clear that we can model only group-preferences here, but maybe one would need to start at the individual level and aggregate. 

No they don't. They buy and sell currency, because the price of currency fluctuates (due to imagination and/or economic fundamentals) and so there are profit opportunities there. Also, they are after liquidity, (i.e. holding money instead of physical capital), because liquidity enlarges the set of feasible economic choices that they can make (but since they have to eventually make some choice, we get to see some physical capital lying around after all). Money per se is not productive (is just paper, or electronic bits) - but money is not just a medium of exchange, it is first and foremost a socially agreed upon store of value (socially, not intrinsically). This makes it (not just endows it with) purchasing power. People are willing to give up something that has, say, nutritional value, in exchange for an intrinsically worthless piece of paper (or for an even more useless electronic credit in their bank account) -and one can guess why. Finally, all the financial world of "financial instruments", "derivatives", "futures" etc, is a bit about risk-management but predominantly, is a highly sophisticated betting market, beyond anything that casinos, horse races, soccer, etc have ever imagined or devised as regards betting. Here income and profits come from winning the bet, not because money is productive. 

Let's accept the Fisher equation, $$r = i-\pi$$ where $r$ is the real interest rate, $i$ is the nominal interest rate, and $\pi$ is inflation. Let's also accept that the the real interest rate earned on financial capital is the same or co-moves with the ROI, the rate of return on investments in non-financial capital (i.e. in physical and human capital, and or in technology, etc). This we accept at least as a tendency, due to the possibility of arbitrage considerations, if it was otherwise. So let's say $${\rm Corr}(\text{ROI}, r) = {\rm Corr}(\text{ROI}, i-\pi) \approx 1$$ But the above relation expresses association and co-movement, not causality. Then, the statement in question, implies that causality may also run from nominal interest rates to the $\text {ROI}$. With stable inflation, lower nominal interest rates imply lower real interest rates. No effect on $\text {ROI}$ yet. Lower real interest rates will presumably push the holders of funds out of financial capital investment and relatively more into direct investments, for which they will be ok if the $ROI$ is lower than previously, as long as it does not fall below the new lower real interest rate on financial assets. This is a way to rationalize the statement. 

The concept of $\text{WACC}$ seems pretty straightforward... it is a weighted average percentage, calculated in principle as equation $(2)$ in the question shows. If we have two sources of financing each demanding a different interest rate and with given percentage contribution each to the total funds we want to borrow, then what would be the single interest rate that would lead to the same total interest cost, if we borrowed the sum of funds from some third source? And this easily generalizes to $n$ sources of financing. The concept stops being so straightforward the moment one realizes that the property rights and the transaction clauses characterizing the "cost of equity funds" and the "cost of debt funds" respectively are totally different (and this is why this is the first grand partition), and also, that "the future won't necessarily repeat the past". Related to Debt funds, Debt owners have the full power of the Law behind them to seek payment of interest and principal, against the company's assets. Also, the interest rate is specifically agreed to a certain level, and even if there are provisions that may make it variable, these usually create few scenarios one would need to evaluate. So calculating the (unitary) "cost of debt" appears relatively transparent and certain.But: a distinction has to be made related to past "cost of debt" and the prospective one: the current debts of the company may have a certain interest rate agreed upon, but the interest rate that the company must pay in order to get more debt may be different. This essentially tends to make the concept a marginal weighted average, and the company must conduct a market search in order to see what interest rates prospective debt owners would demand for new debt. But for an outsider, this information is usually not available -he has to rely on published data on debt and interest rates agreed in the past from the company's financial statements. Turning to Equity funds, the equity holder has no power whatsoever over the company to seek payment of any rate of return, or of his funds (in cases of fraud, gross negligence etc, the equity holder may demand compensation from the persons that were involved, managers etc, but not from the company as a legal entity). In other words, there is no "legally committed" interest rate here, nor "obligatory" rate of return (funds that appear as equity but are characterized by such clauses are not considered equity but debt, under both Finance practices and Accounting principles). So here the (unitary) "cost of equity" is the rate of return that prospective equity holders would want to be persuaded that the company will generate using their funds. In two-steps: I want $\text{xx}$% rate of return, and in order to invest my funds to you as equity, you have to "persuade" me that you will manage to pay me that rate of return. Persuade how? By past performance, convincing analysis of future prospects, and charm. So how do we calculate this component of $\text{WACC}$? We usually look at how the company is performing relative to its sector. Why the sector and not the whole market, has to do with increased risk that correlates with inexperience: investors that for some historical reasons have concentrated their investments in a sector, will be in a better position to judge the validity of prospective projects in this sector, than to some other they don't have a clue about. So some combination of company/sector rates of return provides an estimation of the (unitary) cost of equity (this again brings in the distinction between a "historical $\text{WACC}$" against a "marginal" $\text{WACC}$). And finally, how do we calculate the relative weights of the two sources? Again, time series data from the company's financial statements can show how this mix has evolved over the years for the company. 

Consider a production function $$y = F(A,K,L)$$ where $A$ represent "technology" (in the broad sense including for example also organizational technology), $K$ is capital and $L$ is labor (again both broadly defined) "Economies of scale" (a looser synonym of increasing returns to scale), is, in economics, always defined with respect to all arguments in the production function except technology. We say that the production function exhibits increasing returns to scale if it is homogeneous of degree higher than one... but with respect to capital and labor only: $$F(A, sK, sL) = s^{\delta}F(A, K, L), \;\; \delta > 1$$ Note that we have not multiplied $A$ by $s$. Note also that economies of scale is a static concept. Let's turn to the "learning curve" concept: it uses the word "learning", presumably not by accident: but "learning" has to do with efficiency and not with scale. And efficiency has to do with technology, which is the one aspect left aside when discussing economies of scale. As a final note, I won't dispute the meaning for the "learning curve" that you report, but I have to say that it sounds strange to me: whenever I have encountered the concept, it was always in a dynamic setting, as a synonym of "learning by doing": as we spend more time with a production process, we become more efficient at implementing it (and even if scale of operations remains the same). I understand that a falling average cost can of course come as a result of the above process, but the dynamic aspect is crucial, contrasted to a static one. In fact, in my experience, in a static sense a greater scale of operations always eventually leads to increasing average cost, if we do not allow for time to pass, and so experience and efficiency to be gained, that can more than offset the inefficiencies that accumulate due to the complexity of operations at a larger scale. The above do not refer to the "easy phase" of decreasing average cost at low initial levels of production due to the inescapable existence of fixed costs. 

The mathematical reason, is that this happens in order for the model to have a steady-state in terms of growth rates: variables like Consumption, Capital, Income, grow at the steady-state, but grow at the same rate, so their ratios remain constant (and it is in this sense that this situation represents a "steady"-state). If they were to grow at different rates, their ratios would tend to either zero or infinity which is not very realistic, since it would imply that the economy tends towards one or the other "corner" situation. The mathematical proof can be found in Barro & Sala-i-Martin book (2nd ed) , section 1.5.3, pp 78-80. Relevant and useful is also the discussion in section 1.2.12, pp 51-53. For functional forms like (generalized, even) Cobb-Douglas, it is really indistinguishable (not separately identifiable), especially since we predominantly use the exponential function: $$Y_t = A\cdot \left (K_te^{zt}\right)^\alpha \left (L_te^{vt}\right)^\beta = A\cdot K_t^{\alpha}\left (L_te^{(v+\frac {\alpha}{\beta}z)t}\right)^\beta = A\cdot K_t^{\alpha}\left (L_te^{wt}\right)^\beta$$ So strictly speaking in such a functional setup we can say that technology is also capital augmenting. But since for other functional forms, the above does not hold, and so we must explicitly assume that technology is "labor-augmenting" for the reason stated previously, authors settled in labeling it as such in order to cover all cases, and when they want to keep the functional form unspecified. Regarding the conceptual issue the OP poses, which is insightful, a conceptual way out is to think of "Technology" more like "Knowledge". So "Knowledge" that goes into the machines, is part of the Investment that augments capital, while the other knowledge turns raw labor $L$ into human capital: essentially a production function with "exogenous labor-augmenting technology", is equivalent to a formulation that includes Human Capital instead of labor but where the investment in Human Capital is not subject to optimizing behavior but "automatic" (which points to Arrow's "Learning-by-Doing" concept of human capital accumulation). 

A world map and another one for separation costs measured in weeks of wages -but none of the two include data on US Economy. ILO's new data base does not seem to have quantitative data on Firing Costs. Kugler, A. D., & Saint Paul, G. (2000). Hiring and firing costs, adverse selection and long-term unemployment. deal with some US data but qualitatively and indirectly. Abowd, J. M., & Kramarz, F. (2003). The costs of hiring and separations. Labour Economics, 10(5), 499-530. Data from the economy of France, related to year 1992. Extensive treatment of various costs associated with labor, including costs of separation treated distinctly. Note: monetary values are in French Francs. Conversion Rate: 1 FFr = 0.152449 EUR. 

You walk into the firm where you work as an analyst, and the Sales Director calls and asks "I want to raise the price $10\%$ today. How will demand be affected in percentage terms? Well, you don't expect income to have changed from one day to the next, and what was demanded yesterday -it was yesterday. So the only variable (for today) in the equation is price, and the best you can say is "I expect a $(10 \times \hat \beta_1) \% $ effect". So it is the short term price elasticity of demand, irrespective of the fact that the level of demand is determined by other factors also, lagged demand included. 

I don't think you will. For purposes of economic argument, the characteristic of the Exponential distribution that stands out and must be defended, is that it has its maximum at zero. Then, arguing that an Income distribution follows the Exponential, means that we accept that the most probable situation to be observed is zero income. Is it? I don't think so. As regards the study you link to, the main piece of evidence for the fit of the Exponential to the data is Fig 1 page 2. The authors write that they consider it a very good fit. I most certainly don't: the histogram in Fig 1. has clearly a mode at strictly positive values and not at zero. Βut this is the most critical piece of evidence as to whether the data follows an Exponential or not. At page 4, the authors try to deal with this critical deviation of the data from the Exponential graph, by mentioning that there may be under-reporting at low values, but that's a very vague argument, unsupported and unsubstantiated. a) From a theoretical perspective, it is not realistic to argue that the most probable income observed is zero b) The data support this by providing a strictly positive mode for the frequency. Therefore I don't see a case for the Exponential. 

So $\lambda_{i,t+1}$ is the shadow cost of external finance at period $t+1$. Near the end of p. 538 the authors write 

$$y = \frac {a(x)}{b+a(x)} \implies \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial y}{\partial a}\cdot \frac{\partial a}{\partial x}$$ Since $$\frac{\partial y}{\partial a} = \frac {b+a -a}{(b+a)^2} = \frac {b}{(b+a)^2} >0$$ because in your case "$b$"$>0$, the sign of $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$ will be the same as the sign of $\frac{\partial a}{\partial x}$, which is what Romer is asserting. $\theta >1$ would make $\frac{\partial a}{\partial x} <0$, so $$\theta <1 \implies \frac{\partial a}{\partial x}>0\implies \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}>0$$ 

This is tied to a probabilistic setting, but it appears that it can be used more generally. The article even mentions that
