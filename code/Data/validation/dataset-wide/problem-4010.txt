The problem is easier to solve if we think of the grain as a fluid and apply, say, Pascal's principle. 

Short version: if $G$ is a Coxeter group and $H \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup, both acting on a space $V$, is it true that the invariant-coinvariant algebra $(S(V)_G)^H$ has a natural bilinear form induced by taking coefficients in the top component? Now the long, detailed version. Let $G$ be a Coxeter group acting on a real vector space $V$ with a fixed generating set of reflections $S$. We can form the symmetric algebra $S(V)$, the invariant subalgebra $S(V)^G \subset S(V)$, and the ideal $I_G \subset S(V)$ generated by elements of $S(V)^G$ of positive degree. The coinvariant algebra is defined as $S(V)_G = S(V)/I_G$. By the Cehvalley-Shephard-Todd theorem it is isomorphic to the regular representation of $G$ as a $G$-module. If $H \subset G$ is a parabolic subgroup then the $H$-invariants $(S(V)_G)^H$ form a subalgebra of $S(V)_G$, which is finite dimensional and whose top nonzero component is $1$-dimensional over $\mathbb R$, say spanned by $s$. Then $(S(V)_G)^H$ has a nice bilinear pairing given by taking $(f,g)$ to be the coefficient of $s$ in the product $fg$ for all $f, g \in (S(V)_G)^H$. If $G$ is a Weyl group, the algebra $(S(V)_G)^H$ is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of a generalized flag variety by a famous theorem of Borel. Plus the bilinear form described above is the pullback of the Poincar√© pairing in said cohomology, and in particular it is nondegenerate. Questions: 

Numerical Recipes, 3rd edition, Chapter 3 describes a vast number of interpolation methods with source code. It seems from what you are telling us that something is confused in the paper: Chebyshev interpolation has to do with picking points at which to minimize error of the ensuing result, but perhaps something else was meant/the usage is slightly different. 

In Claus Sorenson's PhD thesis, he proves a theorem about level lifting of paramodular forms whose associated automorphic representation has component $\pi_{\infty}$ that is the "cohomological holomorphic discrete series representation". But it isn't clear to me why the definite article is appropriate, or how to translate this description into Blattner parameters. So what is this representation, and why it is unique as defined above? 

The image of $\Lambda_2$ in $G/\Lambda_1$ is finite. Take a set of representatives $s_1, s_2, \ldots s_n$ in $\Lambda_2$. Now consider $\cup s_i F_2$. I claim this is a Borel fundamental domain for $F_1$. It is Borel as it is a finite union of Borel sets. Let $g\Lambda_1$ be a coset of $\Lambda_1$. Then $g\Lambda_2$ intersects $F_2$ in a single point $x$. Now, $\Lambda_2 = \cup s_i \Lambda_1$, and so $x$ is in some $s_i$ translate of $F_2$, and hence in $F_1$. It is unique as otherwise we have $s_i \lambda_1 = s_j \lambda_1'$, which would mean our set of representatives was too big in the first place. 

Can the non-degeneracy of the bilinear form be proved by purely combinatorial methods, without appealing to Borel's theorem? Can it be extended to all pairs $(G,H)$ where $G$ is just a finite Coxeter group? 

Both are instances of a more general version of Baer's criterion for Grothendieck categories with a family of generators [which I've seen mentioned yet never found a proof], but I haven't been able to adapt this to the general context. 

I have been looking for a couple of days for the answer to this question to no avail. Let me define what $\Sigma$-injective is. 

These "obvious morphism" come from the following setup: By 2 we may replace $R^\bullet$ with a bounded complex $I^\bullet$ such that each $I^i$ is injective as left and right $A$-module (but not necessarily as bimodule). Thus for every complex of left $A$-modules $M^\bullet$ there is a map, defined at the level of chain complexes \begin{align*} M^\bullet \to Hom_{A^\circ}(Hom_A(M^\bullet, I^\bullet), I^\bullet) \end{align*} given by simple evaluation. Passing to the derived category, the complex on the r.h.s. is isomorphic to $\mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), R^\bullet)$. Putting $M^\bullet = A$ gives us the morphism of point 3 of the above definition (if $M^\bullet$ is a complex of bimodules then the map respects this structure), and in the paper Yekutieli proves that this map is an isomorphism for $A$ if and only if it is an isomorphism whenever $M^\bullet$ is a bounded complex with finitely generated cohomology modules. So far, so good. Dualizing complexes, when they exists, are not unique. In order to fix a special class of isomorphisms Yekutieli introduces local cohomology. Set $\Gamma_m(-) = \varinjlim Hom_A(A/A_{\geq n},-)$, where $A_{\geq n}$ denotes the ideal of elements of $A$ of degree at least $n$. This is a left exact functor, with a right derived functor $\mathcal R \Gamma_m$ defined over left bounded complexes of left $A$-modules. Then he states that there is a map similar to that above, \begin{align*} \mathcal R \Gamma_m(M^\bullet) \to \mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), \mathcal R \Gamma_m(R^\bullet)) \end{align*} It is this map I am trying to make sense of. By looking at it simply at the level of complexes, we might feel tempted to replace $M^\bullet$ by an injective resolution $J^\bullet$, reuse our old resolution of $R^\bullet$ called $I^\bullet$, and thus obtain a map \begin{align*} \Gamma_m(J^\bullet) \to Hom_{A^\circ}(Hom_{A}(J^\bullet, I^\bullet), \mathcal \Gamma_m(I^\bullet)) \end{align*} given again by evaluation. This is indeed well-defined, but the problem is that passing to the derived category, it is not immediate, at least to me, that the complex on the r.h.s. is isomorphic to $\mathcal R Hom_{A^\circ}(\mathcal R Hom_{A}(M^\bullet, R^\bullet), \mathcal R \Gamma_m(R^\bullet))$. In order for that to happen, $\Gamma_m(I^\bullet)$ should consist of $A$-module which are injective as right $A$-modules, and I see no reason for that to be true (in the article it is proven that these modules are injective as left $A$-modules). Any ideas on how to fix this? Have I made a mistake with the definition of this last morphism? 

Consider an elliptic curve. This is $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a lattice. As a real manifold this is a two dimensional manifold. Therefore, if we want to have an etale cohomology theory compatible with the real cohomology theory the dimension should be two. 

Let $L/\mathbb{Q}$ be a Galois closed field with Galois group a subgroup of $S_6$. Is it the case that $L$ is the compositum of Galois closures of linearly disjoint fields of degree at most $6$ over $\mathbb{Q}$? Currently this looks true from a bashing argument: taking each subgroup of $S_6$ up to isomorphism and either noting it is a direct product, or it has a large subgroup which is not normal and whose normalizer is the whole subgroup. Bashing argument isn't complete yet, so this might still be false. I'd like something more elegant though, and if it works for $S_n$ even better. 

Let $K$ be an abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We know that $[x, K]|_{\mathrm{Gal}{\mathbb{Q}^{ab}}}=[\mathrm{N}^{K}_{\mathbb{Q}} x, \mathbb{Q}]$ where $[x, F]$ is the Artin reciprocity map. Given a modulus $\mathfrak{m}$ of $K$, we get a modulus $\mathrm{N}^{K}_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathfrak{m}$. While I can write down abstractly how the Galois groups of the corresponding ray class fields are related, I don't know how the fields are related: will they embed in an easily understood manner? 

I have a field $L$ and two field automorphisms $f, g: L \to L$ such that $f \circ g = g \circ f$. Under what conditions can they be extended to automorphisms of an extension $K \mid L$ that still commute? In particular they can certainly be extended to automorphisms of the algebraic clousure $K = \overline L$, but can they be extended to a pair of commuting automorphisms? 

Let $H$ be a Hopf algebra and $A$ an $H$-comodule algebra; denote by $M^H_A$ the category of right $(H,A)$-Hopf modules [i.e. $A$-module, $H$-comodules, everything is compatible with everything else]. I would like to know if there is an analogue of Baer's criterion for the category $M^H_A$; in other words, 

The Bass-Papp theorem states that $R$ is left noetherian if and only if the direct sum of an arbitrary family of injective left $R$-modules is again injective, so noetherian rings have the property I am looking for, but I was wondering if the fact that every injective is $\Sigma$-injective is equivalent to some classical ring-theoretical property. 

The skew-field of quaternions $\mathbb H$ is isomorphic to its opposite algebra. Indeed, by a theorem of Frobenius, division algebras over the reals are isomorphic to either $\mathbb R, \mathbb C$ or $\mathbb H$. Since $\mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$ is again a division algebra, it must be isomorphic to one of these. There are several ways to conclude: since it is four dimensional, or since it is not commutative, or since it has more than two square roots of $-1$, etc., we conclude that the only possibility is $\mathbb H \cong \mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$. If you are only interested in Morita equivalence between these two algebras, you can do better: the Brauer group of $\mathbb R$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z_2$, and so all elements are of order $2$. This implies that the class of $\mathbb H$ coincides with its inverse, which is the class of $\mathbb H^{\mathsf{opp}}$. Thus $\mathbb H$ and $\mathbb H^\mathsf{opp}$ are Morita equivalent. 

The answer is yes. There is a sign walk entirely within each compartment that removes the minus signs and produces the same normalized symbol for each train. Therefore the compartments of the two different trains are isomorphic as they have the same normalized symbol, even if that normalized symbol isn't the symbol of an actual quadratic form. 

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups over the ring of integers $R$ of a local field $F$ with finite residue characteristic $p$. Suppose we have a surjection $\phi$ from $G(F)$ to $H(F)$, and another surjection $\bar{\phi}$ from $G(k)$ to $H(k)$. Is this enough to conclude the image of a parahoric in $G$ is a parahoric in $H$? 

I've got a new criterion for comparing Galois reps which are four dimensional if we know the kernel of the residual representation mod $5$ (or any large odd prime) and the Sato-Tate groups (should be same for each one) are connected. Note that we don't need to have a large residual image, so this applies to a different set of representations than Faltings-Serre. It also doesn't use a large tower, making it stronger and more efficient than existing variants of the Livne method. What I don't have are some good examples: the one I was working on when I discovered this method really requires a criterion that works for $p=2$, which is a lot more complicated (and I don't have a handle on yet). So does anyone have some Galois representations to compare lying around meeting my critera? The kernel of the residual representation may be hard to determine on the automorphic side: I'm working on ways to fix that.
