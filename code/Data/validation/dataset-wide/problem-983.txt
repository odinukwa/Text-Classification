(Source:Wikimedia Commons) This is the Matterhorn in the Alps on the Swiss-Italian border. The word horn is used in glacial geomorphology to refer to a mountain peak that has been ground by glaciers on many sides to create a "pyramidal peak" with sheer, faceted sides. During the Pleistocene ice ages, the Alps were covered in an ice sheet much like Antarctica is today, and undoubtedly at some point the tip of the Matterhorn poked through the top of the ice, looking very similar to the mountain in your picture. 

(Source: Steven Dutch, University of Wisconsin Green Bay) $URL$ Wisconsin has late Archaen ("Penokean" craton) rocks and the same lack of later rocks as Minnesota. Wisconsin has a field-trip planning site with an interactive outcrop map at this link. If you could get access to the Black Hills outcrops (uplifted bits of the "Wyoming" craton), you might be able to approximate what tou want with a trip east through South Dakota, starting in the Black Hills. I haven't found an image of South Dakota geology appropriate for embedding, but Here is a link to a large, detailed PDF of South Dakota geology, and here is another link to an interactive site with generalized SD geology. 

(Source: Wikimedia commons) Minnesota has early Archaen ("Superior" craton) rocks and a whole succession of Paleozoic. It has some Cretaceous rocks but lacks other Mesozoic/Cenozoic bedrock. North Dakota has some Jurassic age rocks in its northeastern corner. 

You don't say which lake, but these are almost certainly crinoid stem fossils. Crinoids, or sea lilies, are echinoderms (relatives of starfish and sea urchins) that anchor themselves to the sea floor and feed on plankton. In some crinoids, the animal's sea urchin-like calyx is connected to the anchor by a long stem to a holdfast which anchors it. The stem part of the crinoid's endoskeleton is a stack of calcareous rings or pentagons (called "ossicles") which look almost like a little spinal column. (However, vertebrates are not descended from crinoids, even though Echinoderms are deuterostomes, placing them closer to chordates than arthropods or molluscs). When the animal dies, it falls into the bottom sediment and the stem can become disconnected as the sediment is compressed into limestone. Sometimes the rings stay aligned, and show assemblages like you see in your rock. Other times, all you see are disconnected rings or little pentagons, like the ones all over the rest of the rock. Crinoids have been around since the Ordovician period 485 million years ago, so they appear in (and sometimes entirely make up) limestones throughout the world. 

and every point in it is its "source" in some way. The trouble with your question is that it asks about the "source" of a river in a way that you first have to define what you consider the "source". Does a stream begin where its name begins? Where water first permanently flows above ground? Most of the time? Some of the time? Anywhere there's a big enough pile of wet leaves? In Brazil, the part of the river above its confluence with the Rio Negro at Manaus has its own name -- the Solim√µes, so you could say the "Amazon" proper begins at Manaus. But this is thousands of miles from the river's farthest upper reaches. The Wikipedia article on the Amazon River has the following to say about its "farthest source": 

[I am going to preface this by saying that I am not in one camp or the other in this discussion, as I think there are pros and cons to each side] This links to the "Gaia Theory" proposed by James Lovelock, wherein the Earth is considered a self regulating organism. In this hypothesis, Earth is an organism in that it will try to maintain certain conditions. These conditions include temperature (within a range suitable for life as we currently understand it), oxygen content of the atmosphere, water availability etc. This does not mean that the ball of rock we are flying through space on is a living organism as we understand it, but rather that the various spheres of life (These are usually the biosphere (ecosystems), the atmosphere, the cryosphere (the poles, and other ice-bound areas), the hydrosphere(oceans), and the pedosphere(soil)) interact with each other in such a way that optimal conditions are maintained. Whilst the theory as a whole is not used today, it is recognised that feedbacks and interactions between different spheres occur, and are an important part of understanding Earth systems, and is studied in an area of science known as Earth System Science One of the initial arguments for this theory was that our atmosphere is not in chemical equilibrium, and that there must therefore be processes active to maintain oxygen levels at a steady state outside of equilibrium. This is a difficult topic, as it is important to stress that the Gaia hypothesis does not state the Earth is some sentient being consciously doing anything, rather that a complex set of interactions, abiotic and biotic, combine to maintain and regulate the planets temperature and atmospheric composition. An example of this regulation is chemical weathering, whereby carbon dioxide in the atmosphere falls in rain, and reacts with rocks, to form calcium bicarbonate, removing carbon from the short term carbon cycles. The more surface rocks there are which are capable of this reaction, the more CO2 is removed from the atmosphere. There is a hypothesis which says that at least once, the Earth has been covered largely in ice and snow, and this reaction (known as carbonation) is suspected to have played a part in the recovery of Earth. The hypothesis (Snowball Earth) goes like this: The Earth became cooler, whether due to Milankovich cycles, volcanic activity, or solar output changes. As this happened, ice began to form at the poles, changing the albedo, and reflecting more radiation back to space, this caused local cooling, and allowed for the growth of the ice sheets. As they spread, the albedo became higher on a larger scale, and the ice sheets eventually covered the two hemispheres, with a band of open ocean at the equator. The earth was now very cold, but not completely empty of life, or without volcanic activity. Life continued to respire CO2, and volcanoes continued releasing CO2. Without rocks to remove it from rain, or ocean to absorb it, Carbon dioxide began to build up in the atmosphere. As it built up (over millions of years), it began to warm the planet, which in turn began to melt the snow. As the snow and ice began to retreat to the poles, rocks, and open ocean were again available to remove the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and more photosynthetic organisms were able to survive, and remove more CO2 through photosynthesis. This lead to a stabilisation of the planets systems again, although, it may have gone too far, and swung back to a glacial period (although not a frozen earth), then moving back to a warm period before stabilising due to the tectonic movement of the continents northwards The break-up of Rodinia, birth of Gondwana, true polar wander and the snowball Earth I hope this long ramble illustrates how there are a number of complex systems which all interact with each other to maintain conditions. Whether we consider the sum of these systems an organism is an ongoing discussion, but, all organisms have the ability to regulate via various systems, and each of these systems has the potential to lead to chaotic positive feedbacks, and spiral out of control, although negative feedbacks usually keep everything running as normal. I have linked the Gaia theory webpage, and if you search for Daisyworld model, you will find a model which you can run to simulate feedbacks It is up to you whether you think this collection of feedback systems is an organism, and this debate will likely run for decades more.

Remember that Antarctica is covered in a sheet of ice. Strip away the ice and you get something like this: 

Both the original laterite and the alluvial deposits have been mined for aluminum. Your assertion that there are no other bauxite deposits in the US is not true; other deposits formed in similar conditions in the southeastern US, and there is also bauxite in Montana. 

From an Earth Science standpoint, it's meaningless to ask about the "source" of a river in this way. The "source" of a river is the rainfall within its drainage basin, which percolates down into groundwater, and the "river" appears where the land has eroded down below the water table. The Amazon has an enormous drainage basin: 

Quite the opposite. Divergent boundaries can cause mountain (well, actually volcano) building, because upwelling magma is part of the rifting process. First and most importantly, the Mid-Ocean Ridge can be considered the longest, most massive mountain range in the world. It's more obvious, of course, on continental rifts like the East African Rift. Mt. Kilimanjaro, a product of rift volcanism, is the highest mountain in Africa. Another famous locale of volcanism at a divergent boundary is Iceland, although a hot spot may play a role there. 

Circles! Well, some of them, anyway. You can plot any azimuthal projection in polar coordinates, where the radius is a function of the angular distance from the center point. So where two points' angular distances are the same, their radii are the same, and the projection of any locus of constant angular distance from the center point is a circle, if it appears at all. Since you said that the tangent point is a pole, that means that parallels (lines of constant latitude) are those lines of constant angular distance. Ergo, Northern Hemisphere parallels appear as circles. 

Source: USGS (via usu.edu) But BUT BUT it seems you want to know what happens to existing mountains. Some others have answered that only erosion destroys mountains, and that's mostly right, but only because it's a matter of timing. It's often difficult for us humans to comprehend just how big geological time scales are. Most of the time, a mountain range created by a continental collision is eroded away completely by the time the next rift comes along. This was the case along the eastern seaboard of the United States. The mountains created by the collosion of Africa and North America in the Carboniferous (the Alleghenian Orogeny) were almost completely gone by the Triassic, when the Atlantic Ocean began to form from a rift along about the same line. However, we have an example that might result in a qualified "yes" to your question, a little closer to the present. This is the way the Yellowstone Hotspot moved across what would become the northwestern United States. One of the things that caused geologists to recognize the Yellowstone Caldera was the 80km gap it melted in a mountain range it passed under, separating the Gallatin Range in the north from the Red Range in the south. The hotspot's track might just be the genesis of a new rift that breaks North America apart, given enough time and the right stresses.
