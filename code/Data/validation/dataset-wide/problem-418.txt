If moons about our gas giants are an indication, the moons would likely be tide locked. This makes for some interesting differences in cartography. On earth's globe there's two non-arbitrary points: The north and south pole. And there's a non arbitrary great circle: the equator. But for a tide-locked world, there are 4 non-arbitary great circles and 8 non-arbitrary points: Non-arbitary points: Near point Far point Leading point Trailing point North pole South pole Great Circles: Equator Circle containing near point, far point, south pole and north pole Circle containing leading point, trailing point, north pole and south pole 

A few years ago I would have said stable lunar satellites weren't possible. High orbits near the Hill Sphere boundary get destabilized by the earth's influence. Low orbits are destabilized by lunar mass concentrations (mascons for short.) Then I read the Keck proposal for parking an asteroid in lunar orbit. I was surprised when they mentioned the possibility of parking the rock in a stable lunar orbit that would need no station keeping. Then I learned Distant Retrograde Orbits (DROs) are stable even when approaching the boundaries of the Hill Sphere. One example of a body in a DRO is Jupiter's Moon S/2003 J2. This moon's semi-major axis is nearly 30 million kilometers. Jupiter's Hill Sphere has a radius of of 52 million kilometers. The S/2003 J2 Wikipedia article says 

.7 to 1.5 A.U.? Venus is .72 A.U., earth is 1 A.U. and Mars is 1.52 A.U. So judging by our solar system, 3 planets are possible. Smaller bodies at a star planet L4 and L5 are stable if the smaller bodies are 1/25 the mass (or less) of the larger planet. And 0.04 (M⊕) lies below the 0.10 (M⊕) boundary you suggest. Unless the larger planet is 4 times the mass of the earth, then it could have a Mars sized trailing as well as a leading Trojan. Would a planet 4 times earth's mass destabilize the other planets within the habitable Goldilocks zone? Sorry, I don't know. If a super earth is possible, I could see a super earth with two Mars sized trojans as well as two other Mars sized bodies in other star centered orbits. So my guess is up to 4 Mars sized bodies and a super earth are doable within a sun like star's Goldilocks zone. Edit: JDługosz suggested double planets are possible. I believe this is true. So I think 6 are possible. Here's a pic: 

Make the planet tide locked with its star. There are numerous examples of moons tide locked with their planets. The gas giants in our solar system have many such moons. I suspect a planet tide locked to a star is a common occurence, especially if the planet is close to the star. If the star is one of the very long lived red dwarfs, the goldilocks habitable zone would be near the dwarf star. The globe for a tidelocked body has 8 non arbitrary points and 3 non arbitrary great circles: 

This requirement categorically rules out bows (as well as weapons operating under similar principles, like slingshots), because the energy contained in an arrow is entirely supplied by the user's strength. Powerful bows require strong wielders and practice to effectively exert that strength. There's a technology contemporary to bows that alleviated this. Crossbows Specifically, Arbalests get around the issue of being limited to the user's ability to exert force by distributing that force with a winch. Using modern or science-fictional materials, you can have an arbalest with a very favorable gear ratio that can store a tremendous amount of energy while being easy to wind. The downside is that the easier it is to wind, the longer it will take to do so. However, regardless of how this arrow or bolt is launched, your fundamental problem is that a slow-moving, heavy projectile is not effective as a weapon. Kinetic energy is linearly proportional to mass, but quadratically proportional to velocity. Higher velocities also increase range and accuracy, requiring less compensation for gravity. For reference, where hunting bows tend to have around 50ftlbs of energy, common 9mm handgun ammunition has around 300ftlbs, giving it much greater range and armor-piercing ability. In order for this slow projectile to be a practical weapon in a sci-fi context, it needs to derive its killing power from something other than its kinetic energy. Thankfully, we already have the perfect solution. Grenade Launcher Or a derivative. A 40mm grenade launched from a handheld launcher travels at about 75m/s, comparable to crossbows, while being easy to load and fire and having softer recoil than its caliber would suggest. A variety of projectile types are available, ranging from dumb slugs (training rounds) to high-explosive to HEAT to buckshot to flechettes. If a single-shot weapon isn't effective enough, try pump-action or revolving. You can deliver a much higher practical rate of fire than a bow, with much greater lethal potential. 

Technological unknowns give you the freedom to shape your future as you see fit. Consider some other questions: -How hard is human-level intelligence to simulate, really? At the moment, it's not clear how far we are from having sentient computers. The human brain is a fantastically complicated piece of organic computing, and programmers are having to replicate the product of hundreds of millions of years of evolution by hand. You could decide, for the sake of your fiction, that neural nets and quantum computing are right around the corner, making a future where intelligent computer software is commonplace. On the other hand, you could posit that even with advances in technology, a sentient intelligence capable of replacing the common soldier is still beyond reach. Also, if intelligent machines are readily available, androids could be more economical even if they're more expensive or difficult to produce than simply turning a human into an equivalent cyborg. Remember, training a soldier is expensive, as is raising a human to military age. There is a finite limit on how many conscripts a nation can summon for military service at any given time, before you start running out of people, and it takes time to train them for combat (let alone convert them into cyborgs). Androids neatly sidestep these issues. -How important is the human element? Is sending cyborgs into combat, risking human life, less politically acceptable than sending robots? Do we trust robots to employ lethal force, or do we want a human pulling the trigger? Robots don't need veterans' associations, ongoing pay and employment in peacetime, or retirement benefits, so what ancillary costs are involved with cyborgs? Do you want tactical independence from your soldiery, or is that seen as a liability? -How hard is it to integrate cybernetics into the human body? Despite ongoing progress in prosthetic development, cybernetic augmentation is a complex subject. You can write a piece of computer software to drive a servo motor trivially using off-the-shelf components, but translating an electrical signal from the brain to perform the same operation is considerably more complex. There's also acclimation to the new changes, and constant issues of rejection by the host tissue. Building a wholly cybernetic, autonomous system to drive a piece of mission-relevant hardware might ultimately prove easier than trying to coerce the human body into supporting it. Or it might not. Maybe a wonder drug can solve rejection issues and a chip can translate crystal-clear instructions from your brain, making cybernetic augmentation easy and hassle-free. There's no simple, easy answer to your question. You have the freedom to modify the parameters of your setting to get the kind of balance you want. Whether you want all androids, all cyborgs, or a mix of the two for different roles, it is possible to construct an internally-consistent set of justifications for your stylistic choices. 

Nueroscientist Miguel Nicolelis has been working on a brain machine interface. He claims this interface has allowed monkeys to control robotic arms. Here is a Nicolelis TED talk. Dr. Nicolelis is hoping this will restore ability to those with spinal cord injuries. It might also be an interface to remotely operate tele-robots. I am hoping tele-robots will become more common in industry doing work in hard to reach or inhospitable places. ROVs are already doing work on the sea floor. If someone has grown practiced at using a Nicolelis cap to operate a tele-robot, it would be a small step to use the same interface to operate a robotic arm prosthetic. 

At 1.5 A.U. is a super earth with a Mars like moon. Also at 1.5 A.U. are two Mars sized Trojans. At 1 A.U. is a single Mars sized body. I want to keep this guy small so he doesn't destabilize the super earth trojans. At .7 A.U. is a double planetoid, each Mars sized. This might be far enough from the 1.5 A.U. orbit that a more massive double planetoid won't destabilize the trojans. Speaking of Mars sized moons, that raises the possibility of one of my favorite settings: A Gas Giant In Earth Like Orbit (GIELO) and an Earth Like Moon (ELM). I talk about GIELO and ELM on my ZRVTO post. 

In this case the hottest region would be the near point and the coldest would be the far point. The North and South Poles as well as the right and left ear would all like on the planet's terminator. (Most call the left and right ears the leading and trailing points) The terminator would be the most temperate region. I haven't modeled this but I suspect the weather structure would be a torus with air rising from the surface of the Near Point and sinking towards the Near Point. Convection would mitigate temperature extremes at near and far points. 

Sounds like you're thinking of an apohele or a near apohele with it's aphelion just over 1 A.U. I'm anxious about these guys because they're hard to see. They spend most of their time in the day sky. If they appear at night, they're close to the horizon where light pollution and atmospheric distortion hide them. When they're closest to earth, they are presenting us their night side which also makes them difficult to detect. There are a multitude of possible apohele impact scenarios. I'll pick one out of a hat. Say asteroid's perihelion is .3 A.U. and aphelion is 1 A.U. When this asteroid comes into earth's sphere of influence, it's path is better modeled as a hyperbola with a Vinf of 9.55 km/s. Set perigee of this hyperbola at 2578 km from earth's center (in other words, 3800 km below earth's surface). This rock would strike the earth at a speed of about 14.7 km/s and flight path angle at time of impact would be close to 45º If you set up this rock's orbit so aphelion coincides with an ascending or descending node, you could pick the earth latitude of impact by adjusting inclination of the orbit. Don't have time at the moment to show the math. Some terms to Google are Vis Viva Equation and Flight Path Angle. 

In addition to what Tim B said about evolution favoring the fittest organism, which may not necessarily be the most intelligent, it sounds like what you're asking for is sentience, rather than raw intelligence per se. Slime molds, for example, are capable of surprisingly intelligent pathfinding, but are very, very far from any kind of sentience, self-awareness, or other qualities which we traditionally associate with human intelligence. Similarly, the computer you're using is certainly extremely intelligent in its number-crunching ability and with the right program can solve incredibly complex tasks, but clearly lacks sentience. So the simple answer is that no, it does not appear that evolution intrinsically favors intelligence. Intelligence is a trait with trade-offs that are not always worth it. However, the more complex answer is that even if intelligence exists, it may not be intelligence as we know it. An organism could be a highly intelligent, competitive problem-solver, but utterly lack the forms of cognition like self-awareness and introspection that are implied by your question. If you're interested in a (fictional) example, the core theme of Peter Watts novel Blindsight is whether or not sentience is a prerequisite for intelligence, and might give you inspiration for your worldbuilding. It's worth a read. 

Give each train its own plow High-velocity impacts with lightweight projectiles don't follow the intuitive pattern of a bullet drilling through anything in its way, requiring very thick armor to prevent penetration. Rather, the faster the projectile, and the lighter it is, the more the impact resembles a small explosion. At relativistic speeds, and with individual atoms of interstellar medium, the result is an explosive burst of radiation that does not penetrate no matter how thin the shield is. Mitigating this radiation and sustaining the ablation rate of constant bombardment are the primary concerns. Thus, the plow does not need to be incredibly thick or enormously massive. On a trip to Alpha Centauri (4.4ly) at up to 0.2c, a spacecraft would appear to suffer only half a millimeter of ablation to a quartz shield. The individual particles explode on contact with the shield, blasting out microscopic divots, but not penetrating through to affect the spacecraft behind them. As long as the shield is thick enough to survive ablation over the duration of the journey, it will suffice. At 0.8c, the amount of energy released in each impact will be considerably greater than at 0.2c, but the required shielding still isn't excessive. If the rate of ablation scales linearly with the kinetic energy of collision, this implies around a centimeter of ablation for the 4.4 light-year distance. Each train can be given a shield just a few centimeters thick and slightly larger in diameter than the train itself- there's no need for it to be ten times the size of the train, or for it to be the size of a spacecraft in its own right. A simple, disposable shield made of easily-available materials will suffice, can be recycled and reformed into new shields at the destination, and in the context of interstellar travel is so cheap it's hardly worth accounting for.
