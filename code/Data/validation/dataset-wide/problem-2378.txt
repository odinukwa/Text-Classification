Here's the answer to your last analogy.... What kinds of circumstances come in this category an what does not? 

recently i read an article about a troubled young man who was brought to attention by one of his friends to a temple. Here is a brief description.... 

Bottom line Buddhism is not a Fortune cookie, It is there to reach nirvana and it is with the advice to live your life correctly and successfully until you reach there.It is not the go to bundle of life advice people think it is. It will teach you to be a better person and to see the life in a different light but if your intention is to be a millionaire and life the life of a kingpin you came to the wrong place. Buddhism is the path to stopping the pain & suffering, it is not your career guru or marriage counselor. 

The time flowing is a purely a mental projection.But how? Imagine yourself in a field, here you do not have a watch it is dark sun is not coming up can you guess the time now? This is an actual experiment to explain how humans experience time.Time for humans is very easy to understand, watch a movie for 2 hours and sit down,start meditating for 2 hours.You will feel like it is 4-5 or 5 1/2 hours. The experiencing of the flow of time is relative to what you are experiencing now.If what you are doing is exiting time is faster to your mind (Like a date with the love of your life). But if what you are doing is boring time is slower to your mind (Like school) So the conclusion is the feeling of time passing by is a complete illusion of mind thinking.If the mind was asleep like you do in the night you will not feel it at all. (If there was no clock in your house can you say how many hours you slept last night?) 

I normally do not dream and if i dream those are very long and mixed when it comes to content (Both calming and provoking). So what is the Buddhist point of view on dreams. 

As to Buddhism all sorts of love is "Attachment". And the is no such thing called a person. So essentially the "Love" we fall in can be explained as... 

First of all as to Buddhism every being has an ego not only us humans. If no other creature had ego will they fight for survival,no! You need to understand one thing Yes Buddhism has its own version of "Evolution" and it may be the only religion on the face of the earth that will ever accept evolution because other cry babies can't do it with all the unscientific lies they believe in! But as to the evolution Buddhism believes in our bodies evolved according to the environment, not our minds.We were always mentally above those poor animals.You see "Darwin's Evolution" and "Buddha's Evolution" are two different things.As to Lord Buddha's evolution we are not from apes, Yes we were in the caves but not as dum apes.And as to Lord Buddha we had many extremely advanced civilizations before the current. As to Lord Buddha yearly versions of humans lived so long (even above 60,000 years of lie expectancy) and they had no sicknesses because everything was new. As Lord Buddha our ability to do advanced thoughts and logic is not anything but what is given to a human by Karma.Whoever born as an animal has less karma and will not have that ability but it will still have an ego (For example look at the kingdom of monkeys the alpha male kill or bite off the penis of new born's and less powerful monkeys to own the female kind and the rights to have sex).But Buddhism deny that one day the animals can be like us,As to Buddhism it is impossible because the mind's abilities are a cause of Karma not a matter of the brain's size. And Buddhism is not a product of some guy's ego.Buddhism is the product of a great one who was riddled by the world. The very birth of Buddhism was born with the destruction of "Prince Siddahrtha's ego" (The price who became our Lord Buddha). If you have any questions please leave a comment below. May triple gems bless you! 

The root evil in these types of view points / perceptions / notions is the view point / perception / notion itself (See: Skandha). This perception off Sanna creates fabrication by reacting. When you put aside perception about self / karma relate views, then by this you are liberated from this fabrication (karmic formation) related to these view. Developing a perception off no self can be conducive to dissolve ego but also can be a hindrance as this can lead to clinging to the view. So you have to let go of this also. Hindu techniques can take you upto the lever that there is neither perception nor perception and with some residual sensations (called Passadhi in Buddhism). Buddhism deals even eradicating the last residual bit off perception and sensations and to there you can have very mild for of clinging. As with both Hindu and Buddhism the breath is the body conditioner. In the Pranayama you control the breath to created desired effects on the body and life. These could be extreme pleasantness of even very tranquil feelings. In the Buddhism version of Breath meditation there are 16 stages out off which the 1st 4 deals with calming the bodily fabrication as opposed to creating new bodily fabrications. By calming the bodily fabrication also you get tranquillity but this is born out of the process of calming as well as dissolving unwholesome fabrication than creating fabrications. In Buddhism there are 3 evil roots or poisons: loba, dosa and moha. Dosa generally creates uneasy feeling but based on loba and moha (action based on perception) can create Piti and Passadhi respectively. (See: 7 factors of enlightenment). So the road the Patanjali / Vedic system and Buddhism is taking are different roads. 

Realise the mind has wondered away Have a look at the object which it has wondered away to and the sensation it creates (if thoughts around the head) Look at how you perceive this and the metal reaction that follows (if thoughts around the head) These sensations trigger more thoughts and reactions in quick succession which in tern creates more sensations Bring back your mind to your object of meditation 

Acinteyya Sutta mentions karmma is unfathomable thence thinking and trying to read too much into it is futile for a person who is not a Buddha. I think what is said is that you should not judge the working of Karma. 

Killing your parents is a Anathariy Karma. This is worse than Garuka Karma. Instrumenting this directly or indirectly results in the same Karma. Bottom line is that you should be always good to your parents. 

Brain damage might reduce mental capacity. An Arahat is free from the unwholesome roots, i.e., they have stopped reacting to sensual stimuli. Brain damage or not unwholesome roots do not arise again. So they do not lose their attainment. 

From what I understood, each of these practices are clearly different Calm meditation deals with developing the Jhana factors which are: 

Source: Piya Tan's summary of (Nibbidā) Dhamma,kathika Sutta Also see if the teachings promote Dhamma and Vinaya as in (Dhamma,vinaya) Gotamī Sutta. It should promote good of oneself and good of others (which is discussed in detail in (Aṭṭhaka) Alaṁ Sutta). If the teaching is for gain, honour and praise then this is not in tune with the true teachings. [Bhindi Sutta] 

So the psychological effect of practicing mindfulness meditation is that your come out of stress. This in turn would have physical benefits also. Also 4 scientific studies on how meditation can affect your heart, brain and creativity gives reference to some research on the physiological effects of meditation. Also Slow down! Enjoy life touches on both physiological and psychological benefits. Always the physiological and psychological benefits are always interrelated as we are dealing with Namarupa. Another aspect of Buddhist meditation is that when you do Vipassana, your old fabrication / conditioning / karma surfaces as sensations and then pass away. If the you have a physical illness which is either psychosomatic in nature or Karmic in nature there is a chance that it might be heal by the passing away of the Karmic conditioning which might be causing the disorder. Following additional references also may be of value (This is more on psychology but this has a knock on effect on physiology): 

There have been books supporting the idea suggested in your question ("Jesus might have been trained in the ways of Buddhism?"). Christianity was a religion not generated from a teaching and converted to text. If you study Christianity's origins as an outsider from a historical perspective you will see that Kings,Clergy & some other influential figures modified the religion to suit the needs and even the birth of modern Christianity is a bit of a untold story. As Buddhists we do not speak bad of other people's faiths so what needs to be said about the suggestion you make is that there hasn't been direct proof of any kind to support the idea. And even if Jesus was a Buddhist he would not go around offering food and walking on water because Lord Buddha forbid the acts of miracles unless it was an extremely necessary task. Let me tell you a story for why i'm saying this..... 

I have learned that there is an auspicious place on the Human realm that all Bodhisattvas (Who are destined to be A Lord Buddha) reach nirvana and become Lord Buddhas. And this place is the same place every time even after all the destruction that can happen. This time it was India and next time maybe there will be no India, Next time it may be on an island. What we are talking about is a universal position that does not change,its geography,name and other things may change but it will always be the same place in the universe. Another Buddha can't be born in a particular realm while there is already a previous Buddha's teaching. (Please not that this is "Theravada Buddhism" and "Mahayana Buddhists" believe in multiple Buddhas in different realms. But even them do not believe that another Buddha can be born in a particular realm while there is already a previous Buddha's teaching.) 

I have heard about "Mahabhutha" as 4 elements but in few occasions as 6 elements with the addition of "Akasha" & "Vijñāna". Can someone explain why there is a difference and how they connect with the other 4 elements? 

Here are some links from news web sites about the whole thing Amendment-of-laws-on-Buddhist-temples-will-take-decision-making-power-away-from-Maha-Sangha 

Now there are dozens of videos on the internet, people hypnotizing others to change the gender attached behaviors and it works in fact it can permanently change someones idea about his or her own gender. After thinking about these things i came to an idea like this, Gender as a spiritual part is an illusion. As Lord Buddha has said "Gender is also subjected to "Anatta / Anatman", Even gender can change according to the desires and actons of a being". So as to Buddhism you and i,we all have been in both genders and we all have even been "Transsexual". So as there is no "Soul" it is OK to think that gender is a post Birth process that we learn and act after. Because there is no point that we can show to say that gender is real. 

I live in Asia and i am aware of the situation. Yes it is sad and here is how and why it is happening. 

Birth / Start Change Decay Death / End Anything can be put in this equation and literally it is a meditation,Vipassana means seeing things as they really are, Here are some example teachings. A bag with an opening at both ends (Meditation of foulness) Slaughtered cow (Meditation on elements) Verily my own body, too (Meditation on nine cemetery contemplations) 

I would like to tell you the story of "Manduka deva putta" One day a man heard lord Buddha advising some people and he went to join them.This man was a Shepard and he had a stick with him.So he went there and found a vacant place and started listening.He did not sit down,he was standing up. He was exited about what he was learning and payed no attention to anything else.what he did not noticed was that there was a frog right next to his stick.As he was standing he used his stick to support his weight and the frog was caught among the stick and the ground. The frog was listing to the voice of lord Buddha and it was paying no attention to anything either.So when the frog was caught it had no chance to escape and it died on the spot. It died and opened eyes again what it saw was the "Deva realm" and it was not a frog anymore he was a "Deva".Quickly he memorized what happened and came to see lord Buddha and said what happened. This is a good example about not knowing the meaning and still having good results from dharma.
