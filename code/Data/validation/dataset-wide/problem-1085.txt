That command alone will copy the logins from DB1 over to DB2 and simply sync up anything that changed. So say you add another database to the AG and grant a login access (map a user), then next time you run the above command it will update that login on DB2 for you. The below script is included for completeness just to show what can be done. I built the below process on a client's 4 node AG as a Scheduled Task. As well this offers the ability to exclude replicas if you need; it was something they required. 

A good write-up by Michael J. Swart seems to indicate that a key lookup will count toward the counter under the Access methods: 

There is really no other way than to use a case statement if you want the plain English version of all the integer values used by SQL Server (at least to my limited knowledge of T-SQL). This is a common thing needed by a lot of DBAs and there are plenty of scripts out there on the subject. I found the script below from Michelle Ufford to be quite useful in getting a good view of the schedule of jobs running. Since maintenance plans end up as SQL Agent jobs this will show you that as well. The output you get from the script will give you the frequency, subFrequency, scheduled time and next run time and date. I just took her script and put it as a stored procedure on my server so I can easily run it when needed. You could also put it as a view if you wanted too. Since other folks can come behind me and add jobs and such I like to check it every-now-and-then to see what is going on. 

This is more for SO than DBA, but if you are using the identity/password for the app pool in IIS it will encrypt the password for you when it is stored. However, be aware that even with this process passwords can still be decrypted with not much work. The connection string itself does not allow you to enter an encrypted password, the mechanism that is saving the connection string handles encrypting sensitive data (or should). 

If I'm not mistaken the default trace contains property changes to logins which should include an account being disabled. An article that walks though the various information you can get from the default trace. EDIT OK, already confirmed not much at all is captured with manipulating logins on an instance. So unless you had something already capturing the information like SQL Server Audit (if on 2008 or higher), there is nothing natively logged by SQL Server to let you know who did it. If you happen to be logging successful logins to that instance you can determine who was logged in that had the permissions but that is the closest you will likely get. 

The option is in SSMS but it will not work. SSMS is not Edition smart so to speak, they did not make it smart enough to hide options specific to the Edition you are running. If you try to use it, I believe it just gives you a message relating to "this is an Enterprise only feature"; or something close to it. 

I am not aware that it does this other than what I stated above. I would expect that the event was captured it just has not meet the thresholds required for it to be dispatched to your live data viewer. I tested this with the following query from : 

There are two timeouts because they are for 2 different mechanisms for health of the WSFC and SQL Server. Both are changed via the WSFC property of the AG resource, picture is shown in the linked article above. 

Both of these modules are available in the PowerShell Gallery so from a machine with Internet access you can simply run the following command to install the latest version: 

A database may contain malicious code, possibly a procedure that is going to change a password for the "sa" login or drop every database. However the only way that I can see that causing an issue is for an individual to restore the database, and then manually execute any code within that database. It would not execute in any automated manner. There is no setting that can be applied within a database to have SQL Server automatically execute some bit of code within the database upon restoring it to a server. If it did I would expect Microsoft would loose the Common Criteria certification for the product. That is to great of a bug to have allowed in a DBMS to me. 

"MSSQL.1" is not the directory for a SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. You should verify the directory you are trying to place the database in. The default data path for a normal installation is: "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLServer\MSSQL\Data". Edit If this is indeed the path of the databases for your SQL Server 2008 R2 instance then you can verify this by running the following query: 

Edit If your setup involves your BI server being standalone and the report server database is being hosted on the BI server and not the production database then yes upgrade to 2014. You should consider looking at the new deployment methods with SSIS, very cool stuff. If your setup involves: 

Well for security reason you should not be letting anyone use the "sa" account. If you do then obviously changing that password will break whatever is using it. I try to set this password to a random password, rename it (only SQL 2005 and above allow this), and then disable it. I have not found anything so far that explicitly requires the "sa" account to function, my own admin account suffices. With regards to the service account this should not cause any problems. Again as long as no other resource or service is using the same account. The only backup plan I can suggest is having the old password handy to reset the accounts back to in the event something breaks. 

My thoughts... The reason is throwing that error is because MS wrote it too. [Looking through system procedure code every now and then can be fun. :)] However the fact that it shows up when running the report is indicating that someone/some process messed with the account, or a possible hot fix from MS could have done it (you never know). The guest account is supposed to be there, it exist in every database that is created since the account exist in model by default. Making it not show up in the report would probably require getting that SID changed back to I would guess. As long as the account is disabled I would leave it alone and ignore it. If it was really bothering me though I would fork out the money and put a call in with Microsoft support. 

You can find the list of severity codes on MSDN here: Database Engine Error Severities As well zero (0) is marked as not a real error because as stated in the link above: 

Removing what I had previously answered, since it was way off. Based on your comment regarding statements and getting the messages... The rows affected message is something SSMS returns, you would generally not see that with datasets in SSRS that I know of. I did some testing with PRINT statements and in SSDT-BI for SQL Server 2012 the statement is ignored and not returned in my case. As well, there are only so many places that you can actually put a tooltip so you might need to expand a bit more on how and where you want to use this information. With regards to your specific report if you are having issues with a report rendering only 1500 rows there is no real way for us to assist in that unless you share it more about it, or the actual RDL file. 

Registry keys can change with all software products between major versions or even with a service pack. Instead of trying to pull the values from searching the registry you might consider just using SMO. For instance to find the directory path you are looking for simply use the following: 

I have a database on the publisher that is involved in replication (publication configured for merge and transaction). Trying to regain control of the log file for this particular database (VLF count, size, etc.). Is there anything I need to do (or be cautious of) with the replication setup before trying to perform any maintenance on the log file? I am not an expert in the area of replication and cannot find anything solid that provides guidance as to what measures should be taken. Edit: This would include working on the distribution database as well, data retention was not configured at all for some reason.
