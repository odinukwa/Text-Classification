So, you might be right, but as Cort Ammon described, it could be that you are missing some other piece of context or data that someone who owns car dealerships knows. If you are right, then one could easily earn a lot of money by employing the sales incentive model you suggest. 

We can use reason to understand something of it. (e.g. Descartes) Reason can help, but we first must be given some help from whoever-it-is-that created us. 

If there is no particular duty one way or the other, it very well might be entirely up to personal preference. The action might be a specific case for which there are more general duties that are applicable (eg: "Honor your Father and Mother... by letting them pick the ice cream flavor."), in which case there is a right-and-wrong decision. There might be competing duties, in which case it will depend on the exact deontological framework. 

The point here is that the fundamental law has not changed, how people were called to live the law did. This can be for all sorts of reasons, but the changes depends on us, not God. Why God decided to share which bits with us is worth thinking about. The child bride example you refer to is, to the best of my knowledge, not really part of Christianity so I can't speak to it. It surely would have been convenient if God laid down the law about what was OK and not OK. Then again, where He has (or, if you'd rather, where the religious text that dominates the beliefs of an area has spoken specifically), it's still not always followed. It's not clear then that spelling every last thing would have helped. 

A more common (but still debatable claim) is that with Christianity, religion and philosophy fused in a way that had not before in the west (that is, Greek and Roman pagan theology did not dialog with philosophy in the way that, eg Augustine or Aquinas seemed to work in the overlap between the two). To answer your question, consider these three examples: 

I can't say I've read Aquinas extensively to say anything authoritative, but it doesn't seem like he would say that free-will requires randomness. Consider this passage from Summa Theologica: 

People felt inspired People, being inspired, wrote in language that was appropriate for their inspiration. This sort of writing became known as poetry. We extracted poetic forms (such as rhyming and meter schemes) from what poetry was successful. 

I would also like to point out that faith as understood by many, both within philosophy and in every-day life, is not anti-rational. If you read, as a couple examples, the conversion story of CS Lewis or Thomas Merton, you'll see that they thought their "reasons for believing in God were entirely rational" as well. 

No upvoted answers, so I figured I'd give it a go. There is a thought in Christian philosophy that says that the world is not of God's substance. A derivative of the Latin word substantia is found in the phrase "consubstantialem Patri" in the Nicene Creed, referring to Jesus, that is the "Word of God" ("Logos"). It is made pretty clear in the creed though that while Word is of the same substance as God, everything else that was created is different. Where this becomes important in the Christian tradition is that God is unintelligible by creatures - we cannot run science experiments on the devine. But nature is intelligible by creatures. Joseph Ratzinger (later known as Benedict XVI) wrote about how the intelligibility of nature is pre-requisite to doing science (a summary of the argument can be found here, couldn't find a more direct reference). In this school of thought, if the world was made of God's substance, scientific inquiry would be impossible. 

Probabilistic - How certain are you that veganism is morally licit or illicit? What is the moral cost of consuming meat? What is the opportunity cost of not eating meat? You know have an expected-value problem, solve it out and make your decision that way. Utilitarian - Consumption of meat comes with some costs and some benefits. Benefits might include a diet with more protein; costs might include a diet with more fat or environmental impact. Look at the utility of marginal meat consumption, and consume meat until you reach the point of diminishing returns. (Vegans are people that, having done this calculation, hit diminishing returns already at zero consumption.) Ask "for what end do cows, chickens, etc. exist?" For some, the only end for which a chicken continues to exist is to provide humans with food. For others, a chicken's existence has value in itself. Which do you agree with? 

Couple different points: To your question, "can it be said that he/she has mastered the field?" I would look to the Dreyfus model for guidance. Certainly, some people can have successes coming from fear of failure. Whether they attain status as an expert is more a function of how they've processed failure. An expert is someone who has processed failure by becoming self aware and understands at a deep level why they failed. So, it doesn't seem that "fear" is really the important thing in determining whether someone has gained mastery. Second, whether fear is "good and ethical source" or not, I would look at the Kohlberg stages of moral development. Avoiding punishment is the lowest form of moral development according to Kohlberg. So, certainly we can say that someone who continues to use fear of failure or punishment as their only motivator has not advanced morally. I think you also need to distinguish between "Is it ethical for me to use fear to motivate myself?" and "Is it ethical for me to use fear to motivate others?" In the former case, you are keeping yourself at a low-level of maturity (which is probably not good), and in latter you are potentially repressing someone else's moral maturity (also, not good). 

Wisdom and Justice, according to the dialog, are not something belonging to the narrow purview of a few. Questions that affect how one defines Wisdom and Justice (and your example, the existence of a God, seems to be one of them!) are then also not to be answered by the few elite. If, after all, justice says something (in part) about how you and your neighbor interact, then you and your neighbor must have some idea of justice (assuming you and your neighbor manage to get along ok). 

This question comes up very frequently on the podcast EconTalk by economist Russ Roberts, and in particular is the subject of an episode asking whether Economics is a Science. Statements of the second form are sometimes clearly falsifiable (the Industrial Revolution, for example, was not the result of advances in particle physics), but sometimes statements fall under an umbrella of plausible-but-debatable. As Roberts and his guest Noah Smith debate in the discussion I referenced, there are lots of questions in the social sciences (making claims similar to statement #2) that seem ultimately unresolvable, in that intelligent, well-informed people look at the same evidence and come to opposite conclusions (as two examples, they discuss in particular how the great depression ended and what effect the 2008 US stimulus had on the economy). What is the purpose of studying history beyond a simple cataloging of events? It is possible to take a Bayesian approach to studying history. For example, one could start with the opinion that "War is never justified," then look at an event like World War II or the American Civil War and conclude "well, maybe it is justified in certain scenarios." Such a person might still disagree with other reasonable, well-informed people about what specifically counts as a just war. Another approach is suggested by Aristotle: the point of studying history is to give us examples of how to live a virtuous life to emulate, so that we too may be virtuous. "Selfless people tend to lead happy lives" is (I would argue, anyway) an easier to test hypothesis then about macro-scale societal causes and effects. 

For many philosophers (one example being Aquinas, but you can see these ideas in many Platonists as well), God is among other things Truth itself. Science is a process for understanding Truth. What does science require to be possible? Science requires that the universe is intelligible. Because we can only observe 1 universe, you can never know whether the universe is intelligible as a matter of science.
