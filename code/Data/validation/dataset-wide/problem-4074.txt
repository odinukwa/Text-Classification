I would like to calculate the definite integral with K-Bessel funcitons and a and b complex (n and k integers): $$\int_{0}^{\infty} x \;K_{a}(nx) \; K_{b}(kx) \; dx$$ I could not find it in litterature with a and b complex (We have $Re(a)<1$ and $Re(b)<1$ for convergence in zero!). Any reference or help on this subject is welcome. 

Let's $v(t)$ be a negative real function and consider the following integral with $f(t)$ complex (rapidly decreasing at infinity): $$A= \int\limits_{0}^\infty \frac{1}{x} \int\limits_{x}^\infty \Big(v(t)f'(t) + \frac{1}{2} v'(t)f(t) \Big) \overline{f(t)} + \overline{\Big(v(t)f'(t) + \frac{1}{2} v'(t)f(t) \Big) }f(t) dt dx$$ Providing the integral is well defined, it is not hard to see that $A$ is always positive ($v(t)$ is negative by hypothesis) by an integration by parts we directly have: $$A= \int\limits_{0}^\infty \frac{1}{x} [v(t) f(t) \overline{f(t)} ]_{x}^\infty dx = - \int\limits_{0}^\infty \frac{v(x)}{x} f(x) \overline{f(x)} dx$$ Now, can we say something about the sign of the same expression where we consider the cosine transform of precedent functions ? (we note $\mathcal{F_c}$ the cosine transform) $$B=\int\limits_{0}^\infty \frac{1}{x} \int\limits_{x}^\infty \mathcal{F_c}\Big(v(t)f'(t) + \frac{1}{2} v'(t)f(t) \Big) \overline{\mathcal{F_c}(f(t))} + \overline{\mathcal{F_c}\Big(v(t)f'(t) + \frac{1}{2} v'(t)f(t) \Big) } \mathcal{F_c}(f(t)) dt dx$$ I do not manage to use Parseval's equality. May be we cannot say anything about the sign of $B$ ? Any idea on how to investigate this sign ? Or conditions on $v$ and $f$ to have it also positive ? (Note that to have integral $A$ converging we need : $$\int\limits_{0}^\infty \Big(v(t)f'(t) + \frac{1}{2} v'(t)f(t) \Big) \overline{f(t)} + \overline{\Big(v(t)f'(t) + \frac{1}{2} v'(t)f(t) \Big) }f(t) dt =0$$) 

An FC-group is a group in which every element has a finite conjugacy class. A group G is said to be maximally almost periodic if there is an injective homomorphism from G into a compact Hausdorff group. My question is whether every discrete countable FC-group G is maximally almost periodic. In general an FC-group G is isomorphic to a subgroup of the direct product of a locally finite FC-group and a torsionfree abelian group. Since discrete abelian groups are maximally almost periodic, this reduces the general question to the case where G is additionally assumed to be locally finite. 

The answer is yes: every infinite finitely generated group has a subset which is equidecomposable to a proper subset of itself. This follows from a theorem of Brandon Seward: Every finitely generated infinite group $G$ admits a translation-like action by the group $\mathbb{Z}$ of integers. $URL$ What this means is that there exists a free action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $G$ such that each element of $\mathbb{Z}$ acts as an element of the wobbling group of $G$. That is, there exists a bijection $f:G\rightarrow G$ having no finite orbits, along with a finite partition $G=\bigsqcup_{i=1}^nX_i$ and finitely many group elements $a_1,\dots , a_n\in G$ such that $f(x)=a_ix$ for all $x\in X_i$. If we take $T$ to be a subset of $G$ containing exactly one point from each orbit, and define $A$ to be the set $A = \bigsqcup _{n\geq 0} f^n(T)$, then $f(A)$ is a proper subset of $A$, and the partition $A=\bigsqcup _{i=1}^n A_i$, where $A_i := A\cap X_i$, along with the group elements $a_1,\dots , a_n$, witness that $A$ is equidecomposable with $f(A)$. Edit: I realized there is also a simple direct argument which also shows that $n$ is bounded above by the minimum size of a finite subset $S$ of $G$ which generates an infinite subsemigroup of $G$. Consider the (left) Cayley graph of this subsemigroup $H$ with respect to its generating set $S$, i.e., with vertex set $H$ and with a directed edge from $h$ to $sh$ for each $s\in S$ and $h\in H$. This graph is infinite and locally finite, so by KÅ‘nig's lemma it contains an infinite geodesic ray, say with vertices $h_0,h_1,\dots$. Let $A := \{ h_0,h_1,h_2,\dots \}$ and let $B=A \setminus \{ h_0 \}$. For each $n\geq 0$ there is some $s_n\in S$ such that $h_{n+1}=s_nh_n$, so $A$ is partitioned into finitely many sets $A_s$, $s\in S$, where $A_s$ consists of those $h_n$ for which $s_n=s$. Then $B$ is partitioned by $sA_s$, $s\in S$, so $A$ and $B$ are equidecomposable. 

Answer for the first question. Let $w_k$ be the product $p_{nk+1} p_{nk+2} \cdots p_{nk+n}$ where $p_i$ is $i$-th prime. So each $w_k$ is equal to product of $n$ distinct primes and $w_k$ and $w_q$ are coprime for $k \ne q$. Now take $t$ such that $t \equiv -k \pmod {w_k}$ for $k = 1, 2, \cdots, m$. Such $t$ exists by Chinese Remainder Theorem. Now $t + k$ has at least $n$ primes because $t + k$ is a multiple of $w_k$. Hence numbers $t + 1, t + 2, \cdots, t + m$ satisfy requirements in the first question. 

Given a binary function $f: [1..n] \times [1..n] \to [1..n]$ how to check that this operation is a group operation on $[1..n]$? It's obvious that this can be done in $O(n^3)$ time just by checking all group properties. The most time-expensive property is associativity. Also it's clear that it could not be done faster than $O(n^2)$ time since you should at least examine all values $f(i,j)$. The question is if there is any algorithm to solve this problem in time faster than $O(n^3)$? 

The answer is no, the group von Neumann algebra of the Burnside group $B(2,665)$ does not have property Gamma. In fact, $B(2,665)$ is not inner amenable. To see this, first note that, as pointed out in the question, $B(2,665)$ is nonamenable, and the centralizer of every non-identity element of $B(2,665)$ is finite. However, every nonamenable inner amenable group $G$ contains a non-identity element whose centralizer is nonamenable. This is a consequence of applying the following well-known folklore lemma to the conjugation action of $G$ on $G-1$: Lemma: if an action of a nonamenable group $G$ on a set $X$ admits an invariant finitely additive probability measure $\mu$, then there is a point $x\in X$ whose stabilizer subgroup $G_x$ is nonamenable. There are a variety of proofs of this Lemma. Here is a standard averaging argument: Suppose that every $G_x$ is amenable. Let $X_0\subset X$ contain one point from each $G$-orbit and for $x\in X_0$ let $\nu _x$ be a finitely additive probability measure on $G$ which is invariant under left translation by $G_x$. Then $x\mapsto \nu _x$ extends to a well-defined assignment on all of $X$ by taking $\nu _{g\cdot x} = g\cdot \nu _x$ for $x\in X_0$, $g\in G$. The barycenter $\nu = \int _X \nu _x \, d\mu (x)$ is then invariant under left translation by $G$, so $G$ is amenable, contrary to the hypothesis of the lemma. 

Yes, there is such scheme. It was recently suggested by Craig Gentry. Reference: "Fully Homomorphic Encryption Using Ideal Lattices" by Craig Gentry. $URL$ 

There is an example of a function that is unbounded on every open set. Just take $f(n/m) = m$ for coprime $n$ and $m$ and $f(irrational) = 0$. I want to generalize this in a way to get a function which is not just unbounded on every open set, but whose range is equal to $\mathbb{R}$ on every open set. The latter construction clearly doesn't work. I'm interested whether such function exists and if it exists is there any constructive way to define it? 

Consider multiplication table for numbers $1,2,\cdots, n$. How many different numbers are there? That is how many different numbers of the form $ij$ with $1 \le i, j \le n$ are there? I'm interested in a formulae or an algorithm to calculate this number in time less than $O(n^2)$. 

There are $\binom{n}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ elements from $n$ elements. If we consider their sum it is "expected" to be equal to every element of the field with the same probability. Hence we get $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$ for the number of solutions of $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = s$. This is the first part of your question. Now there are $\binom{q}{k}$ ways to choose $k$ different elements of the field. And $\frac{1}{q}$ of them have sum equal to $s$. In other words number of solutions of $x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_k = s$ is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{q}{k}$. If we choose random $D$ with $|D|=n$ every solution will have all $x_i \in D$ with the same probability $p$: $$p = \frac{\binom{q-k}{n-k}}{\binom{q}{n}}$$ Hence the expected number of solutions is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{q}{k} \cdot p$ which is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$. So the expected number of solutions is equal to $\frac{1}{q}\binom{n}{k}$. 

There is the conjecture that Selberg Class L-functions satisfy RH. So that an L-function needs to have its coefficient multiplicatives (plus other conditions: functional equation,...) in order to satisfy RH. But I would like to know if for a L-function of Selberg class it is possible to find another L-function having the same non trivial zeros (strictly in the critical strip) but having "the sum of its coefficient" bounded instead of "multiplicative coefficients". Meaning that for a L-function of Selberg class $L(s)= \sum a_n n^s$ with multiplicative coefficient $a_n$ there is another L-function $L_1$ (of Selberg class or not) having same non trivial zeros as $L(s)$ such that $L_1(s)= \sum b_n n^s$ with $\exists K, \forall N, |\sum_{n=1}^{n=N} b_n| \le K$ For primitive Dirichlet L-functions the function is itself satisfying the condition. But for the Zeta function we need to multiply it by $(1-2^{1-s})$ in order to obtain the Dirichlet Eta function which has the same zeros (strictly in the critical strip) as Zeta with the sum of its coefficient bounded. (And no more multiplicative property for its coefficients) Any existing results on this question ? May be it is obvious that such equivalence does not always exists? 

It's well known that there are no non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients whose values at integer points are primes. Could this result be generalized to the case of prime powers? The question is whether there exists a polynomial $p(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with degree at least one such that for all $x \in \mathbb{Z}$ $|p(x)|$ is prime power. 

Is it true that every positive rational number $r = \frac{n}{m}$ could be represented as sum of $\frac{1}{k}$ for different $k$'s: $$ r = \sum_{i=1}^{s} \frac{1}{c_i} $$ where all $c_i$ are different? If true, are there any bounds on number of summands $s$ based on $n$ and $m$? 

If you consider only simple cycles (every vertex visited at most once) then this problem is NP-complete, so no polynomial (in $|G|$ and $k$) algorithm is known. If non-polynomial algorithms are ok, you can use dynamic programming algorithm with complexity $O(\sum_{i=0}^{i\le k}\binom{n}{i}n^2)$. This algorithm calculates for every subset $S$ of at most $k$ vertices and every vertex $v \in S$ from this subset the number of paths that goes through all vertices from $S$ and has $v$ as the last vertex.
