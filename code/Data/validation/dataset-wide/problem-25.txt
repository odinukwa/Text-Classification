There are two possible ways I know of why a planet's sky could be green. The planet has a super-abundant biosphere and the atmosphere is full of, what can be only called, aerophytoplankton. Tiny plant life that float in air the same way marine phytoplankton floats in the sea. The planet's crust has a high copper mineral content and the atmosphere is full of the dust of greenish copper minerals and compounds. This like the situation where the sky of the planet Mars looks reddish due to the colour of dust floating in its atmosphere. 

It sounds like a set of safeguards already exist in your world to keep out political shenanigans. Achieving this in the first place would be remarkable. If they could be strengthened that should be more than enough to keep out corruption. Since your question doesn't provide information about how this was achieved, it will be assumed as being the case and taking it as read. Although an extensive system of auditors, anticorruption investigation bodies, and the modern equivalent of the Chinese public service's "Censorate" (an inaccurate term for what was fnctionally a combined Ombudsman and Independent Corruption Authority) which could investigate government practices and operations, and was able to punish any malfeasance. As for ensuring the electorate was properly informed this isn't entirely necessary. Members of the government are elected to be the people's representatives. It is they who should be properly informed and advise din order to make decisions. However, if you want to ensure the populace is properly informed make sure there is a free press (keep out acquisitive commercial interests) such pro-bono journalism and public broadcast systems similar to the the BBC, open government and easy to access Freedom of Information mechanisms. The universities and a wide variety of non-government organizations could be charged to exercise a public duty to scrutinizing government policies and their outcomes and to publish reports on these matters regularly. Basically all the institutions to meet the requirements of the questions already exist in one form or another. The main problem is giving them the mandate. the legislative machinery to ensure they carry out their functions expeditiously and thoroughly, and the resources to enable them to do so. 

Source: Negative temperature The main issue with this concept is whether spacetime itself has a temperature. Also, whether any given temperature represents different rates of time passing or whether this influences the direction of time relative to global time. Here by "global time" this means time outside a given volume of spacetime or in terms of relativity a given frame of reference. Generally temperature represents the thermal energy contained in matter. There is no way to measure if spacetime contains thermal energy or not. Also, there is no conceptual framework for considering that spacetime does have a temperature. Finally, there is no way of thinking about whether the speed of its passage or the direction of time is affected or not by spacetime in terms of its temperature. As the OP said, it is known and empirically verified that high-speed motion (close to lightspeed) and strong gravitational fields "slows down" the passage of time. However, it is difficult to take the further conceptual step of linking the rate of time passing to a temperature of spacetime. Indeed as can be seen above in the section about negative temperature, a negative temperature may be paradoxically hotter than something with a positive temperature. If this logic is applied to spacetime, a region of spacetime at a negative temperature, assuming time and temperature are linked, may have time passing faster than a region at a positive temperature. The British neurologist W. Grey Walter wrote a science-fiction novel, called Further Outlook (1956) in the UK, and published as The Curve of the Snowflake in the USA. This has a time-machine with an interesting hull that sounds like it was fractal, however, the temperature in the time-machine had fallen as a result of its journey from the future. While this is fiction, it suggest perhaps the relationship between time travel and temperature meant be different. Perhaps temperature associated with a time machine might rise or fall according to its direction through time. It is an idea worth entertaining if only for its intriguing possibilities. A time machine could be imagined as a spacetime heating or cooling machine and as the temperature of spacetime is raised or lowered it travels into the future or past. For example, the normal temperature is zero degrees so raising the positive temperature makes around the time machine slow down relative to external time and carries its occupants into the future. Then lowering the temperature of the spacetime to become negative temperatures would also slow down time relative to external time and they would be carried into the past. Is this scientifically realistic? Probably, not. But for the purposes of fiction it sounds sufficiently plausible to be an interesting way of imagining time travel. Scientist readers would be amused by its conceit. Non-scientist readers might think it sounds right. There's nothing wrong with that. In summary, science as we know it does not indicate, suggest or allow for any possibility there is a temperature associated with spacetime. Even if there was, there is no way of reasoning whether a spacetime temperature would influence how fast or slow time passes or whether temperature could determine the direction of time and whether this could used for time travel. However, this does not stop the OP from postulating that temperature and spacetime are linked and that manipulation of the temperature of spacetime in any given volume could be mechanism to allow for time travel in any direction. But it could work well as science-fictional rationale for time travel. 

If your time traveller wants to prove they came from the future, you don't send a man you send a woman instead. Because she will be wearing clothes of her own future time. But just to be sure, she carries an extra set of her underwear. Why an extra set of her underwear? you chime. The answer's quite simple. No garments change as much as women's underwear. Think how much difference there is in the styles, construction, and materials of underwear between now and, say, sixty years ago. Any woman in 1950 being shown a set of contemporary undergarments would immediately recognise how much better they were and wouldn't take much convincing they came from the future. Using underwear as your future person litmus test doesn't lead to any problems with reverse engineering or likely causality violations. Also it's simple and readily portable. Since a picture is worth a thousand words then picture this and for good measure this too. 

One example of adventure SF that almost qualifies for no using FTL travel. That is Joe Haldeman's The Forever war. The reason I say almost is because of the collapsar jump travel. But otherwise its interstellar war could have taken within one hundred light years of the solar system and all travel could have been relativistic sublight (if we excise the FTL collapsar jump because it wasn't entirely essential to the working out of the story) and the story wouldn't be very different. For adventure SF to be gallivanting around the galaxy and somehow remaining in the character's timeframe, both for the adventurers and their stay at home pals, the FTL trope is obligatory. There are a few ways of changing locations to where higher stellar density brings other planets closer, but this stretches things. Loping off to alternative universes is conceptually feasible, but it feels like all too Rube Goldberg a solution. 

I was going to suggest a rogue planet was captured by the blue supergiant, bit CircleSquared got there first. But that's the easy part. The tricky bit is whether intelligent life could evolve there and then develop a civilisation. David J Stevenson suggested rogue planets could have enviroments that were sufficiently benign. In fact, benign enough for living creatures to visit and, possibly, benign enough for life to evolve there. Refer here. So if life could be sustained on a rogue planet, it is not inconceivable that sapience and civilisation might follow. Then if the rogue planet was captured by a blue supergiant, there would now be a planet with an intelligent civilisation in orbit. (Obviously this isn't an earthlike planet because it has an intelligent civilisation.) It is reasonable to assume a rogue planet won't be in a close orbit around its blue supergiant primary. Life most likely was already in place on the rogue planet prior to its supergiant capture. But the additional burst of energy to its biosphere most likely pushed selection pressures to enable the rise of sapient creatures. A lot will depend on environmental conditions, resources available and what the biosphere is like. On the whole a quite improbable set-up, but nature is terribly good at making remarkably improbable situations work and thrive. It's not impossible. 

Let's get realistic. The nuclear weapon is launched, which it is delivered by a missile, and missile-delivered nuclear warheads will be typically a one-hundred kiloton bomb. 

While time travel with Novikov self-consistency apparently allows a seemingly vast array of counter-intuitive situations. Even your future selves cannot prevent what they know happened to themselves from happening. Any path accessing changes to the past will have a probability of zero. Effectively they don't exist and you cannot travel them. Even if the bad guys blow up your lab, you at a later time who they were, when they planted the bomb, there is no way you can stop it from happening. The sort of universe this implies is one where a time traveller can go to those points in time where they make them happen as they had or will happen. There is no going back to undo what you did in the past -- or in the future. If you have been to the future and done something, well, that becomes part of your past. This suggests such zero-probability pathways effectively constitute what Stephen hawking suggested with his Chronology Protection Conjecture.

Is it plausible for a species to biologically detect gravitational waves? Basically, no. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of the most high precision technology developed by the human species. Take a bow, human species! You're truly brilliant to have created such a wonderful instrument 

I've done my funny answer now it's time to roll up my sleeves and get serious. Fortunately, everything needed can be found in the answers of my esteemed colleagues. Starting with Bob Gray's Einstein-Rosen bridge, but to start with it won't be inflated to its full size of two planetary diameters as that will come later. An Einstein-Rosen bridge was the first version of what we today call a wormhole. The original Einstein-Rosen bridge will be traded in for an Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole (also known as Ellis wormhole for short) with Gauss-Bonnet gravity conditions. Because no exotic matter is needed to keep it open. All the details about this type of wormhole can be found under this rock. Youstay Igo's immensely massive rocket engine will be fitted into a high-acceleration long-range interstellar spacecraft. This vessel will transport one mouth of the Ellis wormhole. It is launched with an acceleration of one thousand gravities. If an immensely massive rocket engine can move a planet propelling a spaceship at one thousand gravities should be trivial. The vessel is sent out into deep space. Its acceleration will produce a large amount of time dilation which once achieved the ship will coast at near-lightspeed velocity deep into the galaxy. Travelling for several thousand light years away from the supernova the vessel will be unaffected by its radiation and blast waves. Once it is sufficiently far enough away the ship decelerates then turns around and accelerates on a return course to the supernova. Entering the shattered ruins of a planetary system obliterated by the awesome power of the supernova. At last it goes into orbit around the neutron star that is all that remains of the exploded star. The Ellis wormhole is deployed and inflated to its full size of two planetary diameters. Several thousand years earlier, a few years after the vessel screamed out of the planetary system at an acceleration of one thousand gravities, the aliens inflate their end of the Ellis wormhole to its full size of two planetary diameters. The huge time dilation means if the aliens peer through the wormhole they will see the remains of the supernova several thousand years in their future. All they have to do now is allow their planet to pass through the Ellis wormhole and emerge in their own future. Now they are several thousand years in the future. The worst effects of the supernova are now long one. It is safe for their planet to once more take up residence in its own orbit again. Actually it will be away for as long as it took for the planet to pass through the wormhole which at two planetary diameters won't be too long at all. No more than a few hours. This assumes a velocity of about one km/sec in passing through the wormhole. The planet won't have run away. It has simply moved itself into the future of the post-supernova and it can get back to business again. Admittedly there will be a service interruption of several thousand years, but that's not unusual as we've all had ISPs like that. If that doesn't work, and there's no good reason why it should fail, but this is a further safeguard. Keep Charles Rockafellor's planetary diameter sized black hole. Because a black hole big enough to shield the planet would be big enough to drop into the star and consume it before it has a chance to go supernova. Then the planet ends up orbiting a black hole. There you go, two solutions to the one problem, so you can't say fairer than that. I am grateful to my colleagues for their creative ideas which provided the conceptual leverage to save a planet from extinction by supernova. 

Colonial societies often extracted from indentured labour, where people are often paying off their debts with their labour, convictions, for example, in the 18th century the Thirteen Colonies received over 50,00 convicts, and, of course, slavery. These sources are offered as beginnings on a journey to discover more about the economy of slavery. Good luck! 

A useful paper on BH powered spaceships is this on authored by [Crane and Westmoreland][1]. The interstellar travel and space buff Adam Cowl in his review of black hole starships came to the following conclusion. 

With superluminal communications in the tachyon antitelephone scenario implies that FTL communications only happen if and only if they don't happen. However, there are several scenarios where FTL communications can occur and how they work out will be different. Assume there is a chronology protection principle (CPP), then superluminal messages shouldn't be able to be received in the past. This will remove any problems with causality violation from the picture. This scenario only allows forward in time superluminal communications. Starting with equation for a round-trip time delay for FTL communications 

It is plausible to assume the biotech and AI's proposed by the mid-23rd century. Even making both more highly advanced than proposed. To reach stars up to sixty light years, and within reasonable timeframes for a thriving interstellar economy, suggests 23rd century starships travel close to lightspeed. This will take vast amounts of antimatter to propel them. However, if the starships travel at lower velocities, less antimatter is needed to fuel them. The trouble with this is that round trip times soon push out to longer timescales. For example, if the starships travel 0.5 c, as a matter of antimatter economy, then a trip to a star sixty light years gives a round trip time of 240 years. A starship launched in 2247 will return to its home base in 2487 plus however long it remained at its destination. This might apply to the limits of interstellar exploration rather than to an interstellar economy. Even journeys to nearby stars at 0.5 c, will have round trip times of decades. Not impossible or too prohibitive, but if it's factored into your future scenario then you can know what to expect. With the most optimistic projections for increased, and cheaper too, antimatter production and the rapid development of interstellar space technology and vehicles by 2247 it is plausible we will see the beginnings of an era of interstellar exploration and an attendant interstellar economy. However, it is plausible that the proposed biotech and AI's will exist by 2247, and might even more advanced than the OP suggests. This can be tweaked to meet the requirements of the future scenario. Despite any arguments to the contrary, it's still your world and you're welcome to design whichever you want. These are only my projections. Besides knowing what other people's objections are can be basis for finding ways of overcoming them and building something that will do want you and be more plausible. It is worth considering there might be a wild card factor that has greatly accelerated the drive to go into interstellar space. For example, the discovery of aliens with their own thriving interstellar economy that has expanded out to sixty to eighty light years, but this is located at a safe distance of several thousand light years. Humans will want to carve out their own sphere of influence in the galaxy before other sapients take it away from us.
