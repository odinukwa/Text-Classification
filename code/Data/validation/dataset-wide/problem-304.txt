The economic argument against communism is that a free market is always better at responding to people's wants than a centrally planned system. This isn't just a matter of shortages. Let's say that we had a system where on average, everyone was allocated two oranges and an apple. In a true communist society with no market, there's no way for me to fix things if I hate apples and love oranges (or vice versa). Actual communist societies have generally created black markets to handle this issue. This is not fixable by technology. The problem is that different people have different wants. It's not possible for a centrally planned system to weigh different people's wants better than a free market system (mathematically not possible). I also think that your thesis is incorrect. Even if you were able to redistribute wealth evenly, that would not produce large gains for the middle class. Current GDP per capita in the US is a bit over \$50,000 per year. Current median income for workers is roughly \$45,000 per year. Redistributing produces a modest gain of about \$8000 per year for the middle class (using the original unrounded numbers). But remember that you already noticed that communist societies are less efficient. Even a 15% efficiency loss would eat your entire income gain. This gets worse if political power allows people to aggrandize resources. The equivalent numbers for China are \$7000 and \$5000 respectively. That would support a higher inefficiency of 28% but no more. The problem of course is that there are a lot more poor people than rich. Redistribution hurts the rich a lot but only helps the poor a little. You also give no reason why the innovation problem would be solved. You'd end up with an essentially static system. This isn't impossible, but it might be hard to maintain if there is an option of another system. It's also worth noting that communist regimes tend to be horrible at ecological issues. They tend to value economics over ecology. They are more likely to trade the resources now for immediate gains than to save them for someone else's future (see the problems with pensions in the US for an example of how central planning fails in long term planning). Market societies address this be decentralized decision making. One person might take the short term greedy view and sell while another takes the long term view and buys. So taking your inputs (scarce resources with governments that want to control them), I think that the most likely system would be socialist markets. Someone might try communism, but all the old problems would continue. Their socialist and capitalist neighbors would outpace them. To get to a communist society we'd need a lot more automation than we have now. Something along the lines of zero human manufacturing and services. All that would be provided by automation. I don't see forty-five years as getting us there. Realize that this would have to be really good automation too. The robots would have to fix, build, and program themselves. We're still a long way from there. 

but handwaved the power source.  (For the record, I thought of this before I read the answers.)  If there’s power to spare, there are many options.  But the question said that all the solar power is accounted for, and that fuel (for the generators) is scarce, and I assume that the building complex isn’t within walking distance of a forest, a coal mine, or an oil well.  If the spring provides enough power to drive the bucketwheel (or bucket conveyor belt) and lift water 18 stories, that’s great, but that strikes me as unlikely. One idea that hasn’t been mentioned is to have a dual-track bucket conveyor belt.  One track would bring water up; the other would take waste material down, and thus provide the power to drive the belt and lift the water.  I am thinking specifically of toilet-type waste.  There might be others, but I imagine that these survivors would recycle as much as possible. The rate of disposal of waste varies with the time of day.  This is why it’s important to collect the spring water all the time, so the water that emerges from the spring overnight, and at other periods of low waste-disposal activity, doesn’t just go into the ground. Of course, if they’re using washing water, urine and feces in their gardens, this won’t work.

This is a little crude, in more ways than one.  Perhaps somebody can suggest improvements to (cough cough) clean it up. First of all, they’ll want to have a reservoir (or cistern) at (or, more likely, below) ground level.  This would allow them to capture and hold spring water temporarily, in case the spring and/or the pumping mechanism have varying flow rates.  (I’ll get back to that.)  If they’re collecting rainwater at ground level, they’re probably already doing this. As in initial capability, immediately after the apocalypse (or maybe even before), this could be as simple as a pond around the spring.  Given time to establish some infrastructure, there should probably be such a cistern in each building; this provides some security against bandits/raiders.  Rig something so that the water from the spring runs through pipes or other channels into the holding tanks in the basements of the buildings.  (Try to make it hard for attackers to slip poison into the reservoirs.) One added security measure is “security through obscurity” — after you have built a plumbing system that pipes the spring water into the buildings, bury it.  This may make it somewhat harder for adversaries to steal your water or tamper with the system.  Ideally, it will make the spring invisible. The question of getting the water to the upper floors remains.  Renan suggested a “bucketwheel”: 

It virtually ended a common car type, the station wagon. The station wagon was replaced by two new car types, the sport-utility vehicle (SUV) and the minivan. These new car types were larger and in some cases less fuel efficient than the cars they replaced. So why use them? They didn't fall under the same category for CAFE statistics. They went into the truck and van categories rather than the passenger car categories. By truck and van standards they were comparatively light and fuel efficient. But they were still as big or bigger than the station wagons were. Cheap cars became more fuel efficient and their prices were subsidized by more expensive cars. But car makers had little incentive to make them last. In their ideal world, these cars would fail every year so that they could sell new high fuel economy cars to offset the profitable larger cars. Older large cars became more valuable. They weren't covered by the fuel economy standards, so people who needed large cars continued using existing ones. This was bad, as older cars also were less fuel efficient than newer cars even when controlling for size. Cars became less safe, as they removed material to make cars lighter. This was especially true of smaller cars. People drove more. Because one tank of gas could drive farther and gas was cheap, people started commuting longer and longer distances. On average, people used the same amount of gas even though their cars were more fuel efficient. This had a number of additional negative side effects. For example, fewer people lived in cities, causing their tax base to fall. So the people in the city could afford fewer city services, which made even more people leave for the suburbs. 

That doesn't work. The reason why our population grows is that the death rate drops before the birth rate does. If you reduce the natural birth rate to match the modern death rate, then we'd have died out back when our death rate was higher. Perhaps during the Black Death or after one of the larger wars. Our old birth rate was a reasonable match for our natural death rate. What it looks like is that our ability to change from our natural death rate to our modern death rate happens before we switch from our natural birth rate to our modern birth rate. In both cases, the switch comes from interfering with natural processes. You can't get a stable population by reducing the natural birth rate. There are reasons why it needs to be as high as it is now. To get a stable population, you need a feedback mechanism. Historically this has been starvation. If there are too many humans, enough starve to death to bring things back into balance. And of course the fertility rate drops when women are starved. Our current ability to create food has far outstripped our ability to handle waste. Perhaps you want a waste-based feedback rate--if what is important is a stable population now. If you were willing to accept a more mystical solution, you could make reproduction require three parts: a mother, a father, and an extra piece. The most mystical version would be something like a soul. Until someone dies, there isn't a soul available to quicken a fetus. Fertility doesn't happen. You could also make more physical versions, perhaps a gem-like apparatus that appears in a person's forehead. The mother might have to swallow a gem from a corpse to provide a framework for her ovum. The population size would be limited by the number of gems. Estrous vs. menstrual cycles 

It's not that far fetched to believe that the alien technology will be fragile. Our most advanced technology (aircraft, spacecraft, laboratory robotics) are in fact quite fragile. One of the main difficulties in space travel is that the energy required scales up dramatically with mass, and this would be even more the case in travel between stars. There is currently a project called Breakthrough Starshot that's investigating sending tiny wafer-thin sensing devices from Earth to the next closest star system at about 20% of the speed of light. If successful, these will be tiny incredibly fragile devices, built to be as light as possible. They'll barely have the capability to take some readings and pictures of the surrounding area and send them back to Earth. Certainly the designers aren't going to give any thought to security or defense. The attacker in an interstellar war has one big disadvantage: they have to move their force across an incredibly large distance, with all the logistical problems that entails, weakening them the entire way. Now imagine there's an alien race on the receiving end of these Breakthrough Starshot probes. Assuming they could figure out the basic purpose and mechanisms that make them work (possibly by intercepting a transmission from one back to Earth), it may be quite simple to interrupt their function. That's really the root question: can we understand how the alien technology works, and what its limitations are? If we can, there's a good chance we can find a weakness and exploit it. Of course, one can always come up with a more powerful technology. Some kind of grey goo bomb could be delivered almost undetectably and relatively inexpensively across interstellar distances, and cause enormous destruction once it arrives. What you're really sending in that case is self-replicating information - a pattern that makes copies of itself. Information is one of the least expensive things to send anywhere. However, we do have ways of combating self-replicating machines (in fact we have them here now and call them bacteria and viruses). In general, we look at them under a microscope, figure out how they work, and attack them in one of two ways: quarantine, or medicine. Medicine is just a form of chemical attack on the device... figure out something it needs and take it away, or figure out how it works, and introduce a chemical that sabotages it. The basis of self-replication on Earth is DNA and we have a pretty good understanding of how it works, but also how to stop it.
