This immediately reminded me of the delightfully weird Opabinia regalis, an extinct arthropod from the Middle Cambrian, when evolution hadn't yet settled down into its now-familiar grooves and was still just throwing stuff at the wall to see what would stick. Opabinia looked something like a large shrimp with five (!) stalked eyes; its mouth was at the junction between its head and body, and faced backwards. It caught its prey by means of a sort of tentacle on the front of its head that looked like a vacuum-cleaner hose with a barbed crab claw on the end, and then transferred it to the mouth. So, to answer your question directly: Because the mouth is not the primary means of grasping food. Observe how apes, and especially humans, have lost the protruding muzzles of most other land vertibrates: when we want to grasp food, we stretch out our arms instead of our necks, so our mouths don't need to reach outwards. This doesn't quite fit the details of your description, since your guy clearly does grasp powerfully with its mouth, but let's brainstorm a bit. A large mouth is clearly built for large prey, but the lack of reach makes it ineffective against smaller, more agile targets. So what if it's adapted for dealing with prey of different sizes? Against big targets, it slams into them mouth-first and rips into them directly; against small targets, it strikes at them with its agile head to stun or kill, then swallows them whole with the mouth. If you're open to a minor redesign, a longer and pointier "nose" could be used to impale small targets for easy transfer to the mouth, Opabinia-style. One more thought: perhaps the mouth didn't evolve away from the head so much as the head evolved away from the mouth. Its ancestor may have been stumpy and bull-necked, or even lacked a distinct head entirely; as it evolved, the upper skull stretched outwards for agility and range of vision, bringing an extended spine with it, while the mouth remained in place, or else slipped downwards to allow it to grow larger and stronger, with muscles anchored directly to the bones of the torso. 

Now, let us examine the change in those factors given some massive change in the amount of gold. First, the money supply. This is going to be constant given a massive influx of gold, because nobody is on the gold standard anymore. If you want an increase in gold to affect the economy, you would have to set your story in a world with the gold standard — where the amount of money a government can issue is tied to the amount of bullion it possesses. Second, output. This is going to increase, marginally. While it would marginally increase due to cheaper inputs, which would then lead to a fall in price levels, the impact of this is very small. From the US Bureau of Economic Analysis's commodity-by-industry direct requirements table, around 1.8% of the computer and electronic products sector's output is derived from all primary metal products. As a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the cost savings, I am going to pretend that gold makes up 100% of primary metals, ignoring the fact that there are other metals like rare-earth metals which also go into production (or aluminium, which is increasingly used in laptop cases, etc). I am going to then pretend that transportation costs do not exist. This massively overstates the size of the impact. Even so, as 1.2 per cent of the economy is derived from the entire computer electronics industry, this optimistic estimate of cost savings would be somewhere around 6.7 billion dollars. That sounds like a lot, but recognise that is across the entire industry. 6.7 billion dollars in cost savings is somewhere around one-tenth of Intel's gross revenue. Then recall that Intel is one firm in an industry of thousands of firms. I cannot overstate how minimal the cost savings are going to be in a major economy. Third, interest rates are also mostly unchanged, as changes in the amount of gold don't really affect global credit markets. However, another answer did talk about the fact that people who have their savings in gold will have their savings wiped out. However, this effect is also going to be quite small – the Census reports that the majority of people's net worths are in their homes and interest bearing accounts, not bullion. 

A number of useful answers have been proposed. Significantly lacking thus far is any consideration of what the Greeks called "syncretism." (Note: this is in some respects distinct from the traditional anthropological use of that term, which is now heavily contested and largely irrelevant to the present discussion.) Within the ancient Mediterranean and Near East, it was very usual to encounter the religious phenomena of other cultures by means of a kind of translation. Egyptian and Mesopotamian "god lists" are the strongest but hardly the only evidence. In essence, people from Egypt (for example) would say, "Okay, in the city and lands of Ur and Babylon, they worship many of the gods we know, and some different ones. Isis, for example, is known there as Ishtar. In that place, Isis (that is Ishtar) has somewhat different rites and sacrifices than she demands here at home." A few important effects and implications are worth enumerating: 

As I understand it, the star map in your picture is what you'd get if you stood at either pole, looked at the hemisphere of sky around you, and mapped it onto a flat circle. Assuming the ring is equatorial (which I think it has to be, in any normal astronomical situation), from the pole it would appear to circle the horizon; therefore, on your starmap it would appear as a thin band around the outside of each circle. If the ring was instead in a polar orbit, it would be a straight line or stripe running horizontally through the center of both circles. If somewhere in between, it would be a sine wave following a path similar to (but less wobbly than) the Milky Way in your image. 

A world I am developing requires that only approximately one quadrasphere or quadrant (1/2 a hemisphere) of the planet be occupied. I would like the north and south extremes to be outside anything resembling human comfort—far hotter or colder than the daytime Sahara or nighttime South Pole, for instance. There is therefore a single temperate zone, centered somewhere between the pole and the equator, only half of which (divided longitudinally) is habitable. I don’t have strong opinions about why you can’t go east or west, but it’s a very real barrier, not a misconception or the like. Total area should ideally be somewhat larger than a quadrant of Earth, but this is a very minor factor if it’s a problem. Much of the center of the quadrant is taken up by a great sea, such that the large inhabited landmasses extend from the sea out toward the “edge.” My first thought was to do this with axial tilt, eccentric orbits, things like that. But I realized I simply don’t know nearly enough about such topics as climate science, planetary physics, and so on. To boil it down: 

I get a value for the mass around $2.719 \cdot 10^{30}$ kg, or around 135% the mass of the Sun. The distance from the star, therefore, would be somewhere around (using the expression substituted for $r$ and this query string), 

Argue that the junta regime is the best option in a field of terrible options. Basically, this junta you're talking about, per the fact they are selling oil, is going to have some friends – maybe that's generous – trading partners. So, conjure up some bogeyman, something far worse than what the junta is, something which must be stopped at all costs. And then, sell this narrative along with the oil. It is easy for the junta to covertly support radical no-chance rebellions to launch attacks on the oil supply (also, since this is the most important source of revenue, any rebellion group would be launching attacks on this supply), which will infuriate foreign buyers. The foreign buyers want their oil supply to be reliable, cheap, and dependable. This threatens those interests. So, the radical terrorists which are attacking that supply (who may or may not be funded by the regime) are threatening the global order. These terrorists are trying to sow discontent and destroy the state from the inside. They are the evil ones. Nothing the government is doing is cruel... it is what must be done. The government simply needs to paint itself as the well-intentioned extremist. Then issue propaganda like this: 

Once you accept these points, which are broadly accepted by professional scholars of religion (which is very different from "religious scholars" or "theologians"), the question of "designing a religion" changes dramatically. One can hardly give a "right" answer to this, but there are some general guideposts worth considering by way of preliminaries. Religion is universal Any of the various semi-functional definitions of religion references a set of phenomena that appear to exist and have existed among all human societies in all places and times. We do not know of strong counter-examples. This has a number of interesting implications: 

The wheel is not necessarily an automatic development for humans. Classical Mesoamerica (Mayans, Aztecs/Mixica, etc.) didn't have the wheel. At base, the issue there was a combination of lots of dense forest and jungle, on the one hand, and a lack of large domestic animals on the other. So things like carts just didn't really click, as it were. So in direct answer to your question, you can have it either way, as you choose. There's no necessity about it. If everyone can fly, they might find wheels useful anyway for cartage and so forth, but on the other hand, they might not.
