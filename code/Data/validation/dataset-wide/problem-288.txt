If the magical ability is passed along through the female line by mitochondrial DNA or in the male line by the Y chromosome, then only someone in the female line or the male line will do. And it is quite reasonable for someone to have exactly or almost exactly the same mitochondrial DNA or Y chromosome as their ancestor a thousand years and about 30 to 40 generations ago. And of course the number of a person's descendants in male only or agnatic descent or in female only or matrilineal descent will be much smaller, often a tiny fraction, of his descendants in mixed male and female descent. If it is consistent with your plot, the characters who want to complete the ritual may have to leave that world for almost 1,000 years if they are aliens or demons instead of human cultists. Then when they return they may innocently ask where they can find the son of the person who committed suicide and learn that humans only live for about 70 years, and almost nobody can trace their ancestry back 1,000 years. Oops! Then they may have to frantically research human heredity to find out if they have to search for male line descendants, or female line descendants, or if mixed male female line descendants will do. They may find that they have to trace female line descendants and humans only keep track of male line descendants, or vice versa. Some lineages get smaller and smaller each generation, until they die out. Some lineages get bigger and bigger each generation until they become enormous. Some lineages get bigger over generations and then get smaller over generations and then get bigger again in a cycle. So someone trying to trace a lineage may find that the descendants grow in number to several dozen and then shrink to only one and then grow in number to dozens and then shrink to only one again, and may fear that the numbers may shrink to zero sometime. And if someone needs the rightful heir of someone who lived 1,000 years ago there are many different types of inheritance rules and someone may have different heirs according to different inheritance rules. For example male-preference primogeniture and male only or agnatic primogeniture are two different rules. And in one case for about 450 years the same persons were heirs to one dynasty by male-preference primogeniture and heirs to another dynasty by agnatic primogeniture, but over sixty years ago the two sets of heirs separated at last. See also my post here: $URL$ And single line of descent trope: $URL$ Added 0-18-2017. Because humans have 2 genders and it takes 2 to reproduce it is necessary for the average couple to have at least 2 children to maintain the population level. A fictional gender less species might have each persons who reproduces have only one child since they need only one parent. Thus there could be only one direct descendant over a thousand years if it is a nonhuman species or future humans modified by science. 

You might want to consider No Endor Holocaust. What happens when the Death star explodes near Yavin and the moon Yavin IV, and what happens when the Second Death Star explodes near Endor. Suppose the bomb explodes and vaporizes a sphere of rock 1 kilometer in diameter. The average distance between the Moon and Earth is 384,399 kilometers. So when some of the vaporized rock reaches Earth the sphere containing the rock should have a volume about 5.6799 X 10 to the sixteenth power times the volume it originally had and thus the density will be very much less than it had before being vaporized. But its speed will be very great. But if all of the vaporised rock has a narrow range of speeds, it won't expand as a sphere but as a comparatively narrow shell. Thus it will have a much smaller volume than the sphere calculated above and a higher density. Someone might want to calculate the density of such a shell if it is 1,000 kilometers thick and if it is 1 kilometer thick, for example. How dense does the expanding shell of vaporized rock have to be to do damage when travelling at a high speed? I don't know. Triton, the large moon of Neptune, has a very, very, very thin atmosphere. It has a surface pressure of 14 microbars - one 70,000th as dense as Earth's atmosphere. But that is dense enough for clouds to form and for winds in the atmosphere to have detectable effects. Thus It is possible that the vaporized rock from the atomic blast could have no detectable effects on Earth or wipe out all life on Earth. And it would take calculations to show how much effect there would be. Back in the late 1950s the USA was considering a plan to send an atomic bomb to the Moon and explode it on the surface, Project A119. The plan would have used a W25 warhead with a 1.7 kiloton yield. Apparently none of the scientists calculated any danger to Earth because that wasn't the reason why the project was dropped. $URL$ Of course the plan was to detonate the bomb near the terminator and raise a dust cloud that would be illuminated by the Sun and visible from Earth, while you plan to detonate your bomb near Mare Tranquillitatis, closer to the center of the Moon and making Earth the target for more of the debris. And you plan to fictionally detonate a bomb about 58,823.529 times as powerful. 

As I state below, if both stars in the system are suitable for having planets old enough to have interesting stuff like habitable biospheres, complex multi celled plants and animals, or native intelligent beings, etc., there will be only a narrow range of luminosity difference between them. The brighter star can be only about 5 or 6 times as bright as the dimmer star. Assume, therefore, that the planet orbits a star that is not a G2V like the Sun but about a K5V, much less luminous than The Sun, and therefore the planet orbits much closer to that star and has a much shorter year. If the other star is something like a G0V or a F8V it should be somewhat brighter than the Sun and about 5 or 6 times as bright as the star the planet orbits. If the distance between the 2 stars is 10 times the distance between the planet and the dimmer star that it orbits. the apparent brightness of the farther and brighter star will be diminished by 100 times and thus it will appear only 5 or 6 percent as bright as the nearer star as seen from the planet. Only 5 or 6 percent as bright as the other star is not very bright as compared to the other star, but on the other hand if the nearer star gives the planet about the same amount of light as the Sun sheds on Earth, 5 or six percent of that should equal about 20,000 to 24,000 times the brightness of the full moon on Earth! You will have to find out if that will be enough for Humans to see colors, for movement to be easy and safe, for the sky to look blue and the stars to be masked by the sky's brightness, etc. I think it should be enough. If the other star can come as close as five times the orbital radius of the planet around its star, then the other star could appear as bright as 0.2 to 0.24 as bright as the nearer star, or about 80,000 to 96,000 times the brightness of the full moon. I believe the brightness of the full moon is give as 0.25 lux. 20,000 to 24,000 times the brightness of the full moon would be about 5000 to 6,000 lux, a few times the brightness of a typical overcast day: 

Palarran's answer why a species with the six limbs necessary for your species would not naturally evolve on Earth is very reasonable. The only animals on Earth with more than four limbs are invertebrates unlikely to grow to the sizes necessary for intelligence beings. Of course I could imagine land octopi that start living in trees. They might leap from the trees and glide using a web between their 8 arms. And maybe over time they might modify some of their arms to be wings with a web between them, others to be legs, and others to be arms and hands. But they wouldn't look much like winged humanoids. But Earth isn't the only planet in the universe. It is quite possible that on many alien Earth like planets the first vertebrate-like creatures that crawl out of the ocean onto land will have six or eight walking fins instead of four, and that land vertebrate-like creatures will thus evolve six or eight legs for walking. Thus those six-limbed vertebrate-like creatures may someday evolve groups of beings with 2 legs, 2 arms, and 2 wings, which fit your description. It may be noted that many monkey species have a fifth limb, a long prehensile tail, which might theoretically evolve into a more "handy" organ. And giant ground sloths are believed to have used their tails as third legs to stand on. I think that some kangaroos sometimes use their tails like legs. And I can imagine beings like heraldic wyrverns, dragons with one pair of wings and only one pair of legs. They might slither up trees like tree snakes, helped by using one pair of legs like arms and hands, and use the other pair of legs like wings when they glide out of the trees. Possibly an intelligent wyrvern like species might raise their fore bodies upright to use their forelimbs as arms. $URL$ And don't forget that proboscideans have evolved trunks that serve like arms and hands, a fifth limb. I could imagine a tiny proboscidean-like species starting to climb trees, and evolving feet better suited to climbing along with using their trunks to help climb. And perhaps some of their descendants might evolve wings out of one pair of limbs. And perhaps some descendants of the flying tree elephants might return to living on the ground, walking on two legs while not flying, and using their trunks as hands. I believe in C.C. MacApp's Gree stories there was a species, the Birds of Effogas, that resembled flying elephants. Although I think their form was the result of biological engineering. So maybe your winged humanoids could be the result of genetic engineering by a highly advanced society. Also see my answer here: Mistaken For Wings? 2 

Sometimes the ferocity of Rhinos is exaggerated. for example, the couple in this photo were able to get this close to the rhinos after their guide assured them it was safe. $URL$ Of course what happened seconds after the photo was taken was not so tame. But the fact that the overly trustful tourists got that close before the rhino attacked is quite surprising. And zookeepers often get close to some of their rhinos without trouble: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Here is a discussion about the possibility of war rhinos. $URL$ $URL$ 

Do you need a human like giant? Why not have elephants in your world be intelligent beings, requiring only a small increase in intelligence if any, and also capable of communicating in human languages. Thus some elephants might become warriors in human wars, believing in one side's ideology or being hired as mercenaries, etc. You may think that historical war elephants only carried howdahs full of archers on their back, but some were armed with oversized weapons and attacked enemy soldiers with them. For example, I once read of a war elephant that grabbed an enemy standard bearer, threw him high in the air, and impaled him on a sword attached to its tusk as he fell back down to earth. Some war elephants had long iron chains or swords attached to their trunks and used them on enemy soldiers. Or an elephant could simply grab an enemy soldier and use his body as a club or mace to strike down other enemy soldiers. There are tools with long handles and blades that are swung to manually cut down weeds. An elephant could use a much m larger version to cut down human soldiers. Or imagine elephants throwing tree trunks at enemy phalanxes to break up their formations. imagine a repeating crossbow where turning a crank pulls back the bow so a bolt from a magazine automatically falls into place and the bow fires, and then the action repeats. Suppose that an elephant is trained to turn the crank with its trunk much harder and faster than a human could, making it shoot as fast as a Gatling gun. 

Have you considered thermite? Thermite mixes produce vast amounts of heat when ignited instead of exploding. So perhaps the body could be packed in thousands of pounds or kilos, however much it is calculated to take, totally surrounded by thermite, and placed on a flotation device on a body of water hundreds of feet or meters, however far the safe distance is calculated to be, from land, and ignited.
