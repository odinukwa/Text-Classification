Use the command, under the "Modify" menu for objects. You could also (although it would be of limited real-world use) write it yourself by accessing the individual samples, as illustrated in the manual (under Object contents in a modification formula). 

Your script doesn't work because it's not doing what you think it is doing. The main problem is that the loop in lines 31-43 doesn't actually do anything. It calculates the same values every time, stores those values in some variables, and then overwrites those variables the next time. Every time the loop runs, it is actually measuring the same object, because each time you , and then commands like work on the first selected appropriate object. Then in line 45 you have the same problem: the variable (which you never use) will always be the same, because it is always the name of the first selected object ... after selecting them all. And the initial form stores the path in the variable, but then you want to use one called (in line 7). Here's your corrected script (untested): 

In fact, ‘stealer’ or ‘raper’ would be termed by Bauer ‘nonce formations’: ‘new complex words coined by a speaker/writer on the spur of the moment to cover some immediate need.’ (p. 45) Blocking takes place when these fail to lexicalize. As Bauer details, linguists have suggested that there are some suffixes whose formations are never blocked, for instance –ness. This leads them to posit ‘an inverse relationship between productivity and lexicalization’. It also implies that productivity is a cline phenomenon. Interesting stuff! (Aronoff 1976 is ‘Word Formation in Generative Grammar’, by the way.) 

*cf. Terry Crowley, An Introduction to Historical Linguistics (2nd ed. 1992), p. 153: “Languages are more likely to copy words from other languages in the area of cultural vocabulary, rather than core vocabulary. Core vocabulary is basically vocabulary that we can expect to find in all human languages.” Five basic color words (red, green, yellow, black and white) were included on Swadesh’s 100-word list. **There is an additional consideration: color words may have other meanings besides that of color, as in Chinese 青 qīng, which can mean ‘young’ in addition to green or blue. In extreme cases like Hanunoo, these additional semantic dimensions can accrue and throw into question the existence of a color system as such. See the discussion of universalist vs. relativist approaches to color terminology in Chapter 7 of William Foley’s Anthropological Linguistics: An Introduction (1997). 

The presentation is not challenging "the existence of f0 itself". It is saying that tone is not just pitch (true) and that pitch is not just f0 (true). Tone, in the sense that is being used there, is a linguistic concept that is used as a distinguishing feature in some languages. Pitch is the perception of whether a sound (which could be non-linguistic) is "high" or "low", and this perception (like most of our other perceptions) results from a combination of things (one of which is the frequency of the sound). The problems the presentation raises are not with f0 per-se, but with the methods that are used to estimate (keyword being estimate) what that value is. Of course, that something is hard to measure correctly does not mean it is not "objective". That, I'd say, is a confusion of terms. Or put in another way: if f0 did not exist, which is what it sounds like you were left with, then how could the speaker know that in page 14 it was doubled? Doubled with respect to ... what? 

May be this doesn't exactly answer the question, but pure dental consonants are cross-linguistically rare. Ladefoged and Maddieson discuss in detail how stops which are generally labeled dental, are actually denti-alveolar, with the bulk of the articulation at the alveolar ridge. They also state that for languages that distinguish different types of coronal stops, the actual difference in articulation is caused by tongue shape (laminal versus apical) as opposed to tongue position (dental versus alveolar). The answer by @user6726 notes the Australian aboriginal languages as having distinct dental consonants. Now, I don't know much about Australian languages, in general, but from this Wikipedia article, it seems they too use a laminal and apical distinction. I can, however, vouch for this fact --- as a native speaker --- about the Indo-Aryan languages which have a similar distinction. The so-called retroflexes actually involve curling the tongue back (retroflexing) only in careful and slow speech, or in artificially learned speech (for example, a lot of people learn this careful retroflexed articulation in school, and therefore may have retroflexes in English --- signature Indo-Pakistani accent --- but completely lack retroflexes in their first languages). At least for me, the "retroflexes" 〈ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh〉 are always apical alveolar (with zero affrication, so they sound quite different from English) and are post-alveolar only inter-vocalically, while "dental" 〈t〉 and 〈th〉 are laminal denti-alveolar and "dental" 〈d〉 and 〈dh〉 are actually laminal alveolar! My point of saying all this is to point out that "dental" is often a placeholder for laminal, and in this sense, I can't imagine a "dental" trill, because I find laminal trills impossible, even though an apical trill is easy to make (regardless of whether its dental or alveolar). The other interpretation of dental consonants may be inter-dental, like English 〈th〉, which are also cross-linguistically rare. The hyperlinked Wikipedia page and this page says it occurs in careful pronunciation for plosives in Australian languages. I can make an inter-dental trill, with the tip of my tongue sticking out and trilling against the sharp edge of the upper incisors, but this doesn't seem to be a very natural (for want of a better word) thing to do. Again (as the other answer mentions), Russian and Hungarian (and Rumanian, which I know very little about) have been claimed to have dental trills (for Russian it is the palatized r), but in both these languages the said trills (at least in my experience) are very often taps, and even then are denti-alveolar. 

There’s no reason to assume this is a borrowed word, although Tai languages have borrowed some words with this shape (minor syllable – major syllable, or “sesquisyllabic”) from Khmer and Mon. Marvin Brown in “From Ancient Thai to Modern Dialects” includes several words with the กระ- minor syllable on his list of common Tai etymons, such as กระดูก /kradu:k/ “bone”. While he doesn’t list กระได among them, numerous cognates in other Tai languages suggest that if this word is borrowed, it happened very early. Some of these cognates: Thai northern dialect /khan dai/, Tai Lue /xɨn dai/, Tai Dam /lai/, Northern Zhuang lae /lai24/. Why the variation? It may be that the standardization process in Lao has not progressed to the extent it has in Thai. But more generally, it’s likely that the iambic stress pattern of words like this means that the minor syllable is less stable than the major one. 

With Lithuanian reflexive verbs, the particle showing reflexivity goes at the end. However, if the verb has a prefix like pa-, iš- etc., the reflexive particle comes between this prefix and the stem. For example: aiškinti ‘to explain’ paaiškinti ‘to explain a little’ aiškintis ‘to explain oneself’ pasiaiškinti ‘to explain oneself a little bit; (reciprocal) to resolve mutual disagreements’ Is there a case for calling –si- an infix? It seems like a simple question of prefix ordering. But still, in languages like Latvian or Russian with generally similar verbal morphology, this movement doesn’t take place – the Latvian equivalent of the above series would be ‘skaidrot, paskaidrot, skaidroties, paskaidroties’. Or looking at it another way, perhaps we could say that Lithuanian is averse to morphological discontinuity, since it stacks the prefixes in front. 

How people "feel" (regardless of their first language) can be quite subjective, and in a linguistic context even the word "feel" can have multiple interpretations. As such, a single English-speaker, picked at random, may associate with any of these geographical names a particular gender based on analogy with similar/familiar terms. For example, names of female individuals often (of course, not always) end in (orthographically ⟨a⟩), e.g., Andrea, Antonia, Erica etc., and this may cause some individuals to build a feminine association with names like California or America. [In North Carolina, where I live, I have often heard of people refer to the state as a 'she' or 'her'.] But this should not be taken to imply that such words have a particular gender, since English definitely lacks grammatical gender, except in pronouns, which the answer by @fdb addresses. Now, I don't identify as a native English-speaker, but I do speak English like a native, and more importantly, my first language is genderless (more so than English; we even lack gendered pronouns), and I can vouch for the fact that while I may sometimes refer to a geographical/political location as masculine or feminine, I certainly do not associate with these any notion of actually possessing any biologically female or male attributes, the way I would for human beings or even some animals – at least, not in the way a Russian- or German-speaker would. 

To expand on snailboat's comment above, you might want to consult Laurie Bauer’s ‘English Word Formation’ (Cambridge UP 1983) for some background here. Quote (p. 87): 

Let’s say I’m going to translate an old man’s memoir about growing up in a Thai farming family. My general strategy would be to aim for a style that is not too formal or academic. But when I turn to the text itself, I find that the writer has made mention of different plants and animals that are common in Southeast Asia, but not generally known in the West. How do I go about translating their names? For example, an edible snail – should I make up a descriptive term in English, keep the Thai word, use the scientific name, or just say “a kind of snail”? This is a decision about detail. If I try to avoid any exotic or scientific terms, I will be sticking to my strategy regarding tone, but something will be lost. If I decide to add footnotes with more detail about these things, that would mean revising my initial decision to keep the tone informal. So there is a kind of back-and-forth going on – it’s just common sense really. 

Russian ⟨ы⟩ can be a little difficult to master, especially if one wishes for a native-like pronunciation. When stressed, the vowel in question is a : IPA . But, as with all "hard vowels" in Russian, it strongly velarizes any preceding consonant, which manifests as a noticeable glide after the consonant and before ⟨ы⟩. So, ты comes out phonetically as , where is the IPA symbol for the velar approximant – a ⟨w⟩ (as in water) without rounding the lips. This gives ⟨ы⟩ a diphthong-like quality distinct from in many other languages. One thing to note is that Russian speakers maintain the velar approximant before even when pronouncing ⟨ы⟩ in isolation (without any consonant before it to velarize), e.g., when reciting the alphabet. To make , try following the instructions in this video: $URL$ For an English speaker, one way may be to start with something like 'woo', and get rid of the lip-rounding. 

The last argument to that command is a string, so the variable where you store it must be a string variable. This should work: 

The variations shimmer refers to are much smaller than what it looks like you are after. What you seem to want is most easily achieved with the command for Sound objects. You'll have to adjust the intensity thresholds, but it should do what you want. 

Bonus: What does the error mean? The code you posted does not raise the error you reported (so I guess that comes from a previous version of your script). If you run the code as it is, it will die saying that the command does not exist. The upper-case tells the interpreter that what follows is a command name, which in Praat can have spaces and any other number of odd characters (as in ). If it were a lower-case the interpreter would expect a variable name, and also die. The error you got (about the unknown symbol) is raised if you surround in single quotes (), which tell the interpreter to interpolate the value of a variable. In this case, the "unknown symbol" is the variable, which will remain unknown (= you won't be able to define it) because it is illegal (it starts with an upper-case character and has a space in it). 

Lateral (egressive) consonants are made by obstructing the path of the airstream using some part of the tongue and directing it to escape the along the sides of the mouth. This gives lateral approximants like , , etc. their distinctive sound, different than the corresponding central approximants , etc. Of course, the same principle applies to lateral fricatives, affricates and taps, which find use in a lot of languages. However, I have never seen a mention of lateral plosives. To me, it seems that they should exist – at least in principle. In fact, I think I can make what seem to be lateral plosives and even ejectives! So, is there really some physiological reason that makes lateral plosives impossible (i.e., what I am producing are something else), or are they never mentioned because no (living, known, attested, well-documented) language uses them? Along the same lines, I have seen some stuff on laterally released (IPA ) plosives, such as the -ddle in middle . Is this what I am calling a lateral plosive? 

While as far as I know there are no surviving records of earlier versions of the language that did not exhibit this feature, we can infer that what was originally a pronoun came to do double duty as a gender marker. And the reason for the innovation – contact with Indo-Aryan languages in the region – can also be inferred. 

Is there a scholarly consensus about the status of Thai – is it stress-timed, syllable-timed, or something else? What should we tell our students, who are native speakers of Thai, in this regard? Could I try to measure this myself using Praat or some other easily accessible tool? How would I go about doing this? (I am not a linguist, and although I’ve downloaded Praat, I have never used it for anything serious.) 

他的話很對 or 他的話是對的 ‘What he says is correct.’ Other things like the number of syllables will affect how Mandarin adjectives behave in collocations and as predicates. P and R discuss a number of distinctions that affect how adjectives are used syntactically – qualifiers vs. quantifiers, gradable vs. non-gradable, derogatory vs. commendatory etc. Introducing the notion of ‘copula’ into this would probably just confuse things, I suspect. By the way, in Classical Chinese 是 meant ‘this’. Thus its use as a copula in Mandarin is a case of grammaticalization, although according to P and R this is only one of its many uses. Cantonese uses 係 (pronounced haih, the Mandarin reading would be xi4) as a copula in sentences like 我係美國人 ‘I am an American.’ I would be interested to know in what ways the usage of Cantonese 係 parallels that of Mandarin是 and where usage differs.
