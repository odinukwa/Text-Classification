The instructions you are looking at are for from-source installations. When using APT, just run and everything will be taken care of for you. Note that this will restart the PostgreSQL server, so don't do it when you can't have downtime. 

The package description is "PostgreSQL libraries and clients". So the idea is apparently that you use this if you don't want to install the full server, whose package name is . 

I suggest rsync. It's the standard tool for this sort of thing, and I gather it works on Windows as well. 

This is not a disk space issue as there's plenty available on all disks. We're thinking it could be something with Windows internal database? but I honestly have no clue how to start troubleshooting that. There are other information messages in the Application log for MSSQL that may support this theory? 

Okay, so I've managed to get the service started... but I'm a little confused as to what happened. I started poking around in the SQL logs in C:\Windows\SYSMSI\SSEE\MSQL.2005\MSSQL\LOG and found a line that said 

Each one of the well-known logical replication systems for PostgreSQL is suitable for this: Bucardo, Londiste, Slony. They are not necessarily only redundancy solutions. (Arguably, they are pretty bad redundancy solutions.) Pick the one you like best. Perhaps Londiste is easiest to get started with, but YMMV. (I'm not familiar with SymmetricDS.) 

The tutorial only works when you install PostgreSQL from source. On your Ubuntu installation, access control was already set up, so not everything can log in (hence "authentication failed"). To follow the tutorial, try logging into the user () and then follow the steps in the tutorial. 

If it were me, and I was in that much of a hurry, I'd go get a couple more flash drives and copy them. If you don't already have a few extras lying around they're cheap as dirt now-a-days... The other option would be to set up a PXE server and put the image in there, but that will likely take longer than simply installing them one at a time. Would help out in the future though if you have to do this kind of thing with any frequency. 

Also check the option on the man page about this behavior. A reboot is of course also an option to clean this up. 

The error message refers to a Unix-domain socket, so you need to tweak your invocation to not exclude them. So try it without the option : 

No, this is not possible. Generally, the cache algorithms are smart enough to keep the most used tables and indexes cached. 

Yes, it's a straight file-level copy of the template database, so whatever was in there will be in the new database. 

If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event. The following information was included with the event: NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE [CLIENT: ] The specified resource type cannot be found in the image file It may be helpful to note that this seemed to start happening right after we migrated WSUS from another server onto this one. I've been searching all over the internet for someone who has this exact error and I'm not finding anything. (Don't you hate it when that happens?) I've tried completely removing the WDS role and reinstalling it -- didn't help. I suppose I'd really just like some guidance on where to go from here if anyone has any ideas. 

It doesn't make sense to start a service in run level 0 or 6, which are the levels for shutdown and reboot, respectively. There is apparently some magic in update-rc.d that attempts to prevent this case and misparses the arguments in that case. If you use more sensible run levels for start (probably 2 3 4 5), it will work better. 

When the crash is related to a storage failure, even momentarily, the kernel sometimes chooses to remount the file system read-only to prevent further damage. You can undo that using 

So then I went back and found that the Applications log was full. Saved the contents, cleared it, tried to restart WDS (to see if any new errors showed up in the app log now that it was empty) and to my surprise was greeted by a "The WDS service was started successfully!" message. Wat. No idea what happened. This was literally the only thing that I did... I did have to grant myself permission to get into the MSSQL folders... but that shouldn't have fixed anything. Can a full event log really brick WDS like that? That doesn't seem right... does it? 

I don't know how it works on Mac, but on Linux the EnterpriseDB installer leaves an uninstall script, possibly linked to some menu entry. You should look for that. The two installations should be able to coexist peacefully. But if you don't need the installation, you should consider removing it, as a matter of course. In general, I do recommend using Macports for PostgreSQL and other software. 

and then look for the processes. Since listening on is the default for PostgreSQL, chances are your package decided to use a nonstandard port. 

/tmp is shared by default. You can probably make it work out of there, but probably better to use a more traditional document root. If you want the files to be cleared out with any regularity you could just clear the directory with a scheduled script. 

I'm trying to get logrotate to rotate some logs for me. I feel like this should be simple, but it doesn't seem to be behaving as I would expect. Here's my config: 

I've got several files in this directory that are non-zero files that haven't been rotated in days. If I run it tells me "log does not need rotating". also only has status for the last time I forced the rotation with -f (which was days ago). Just to make sure logrotate was actually even set to run I checked and the job to run cron.daily is definitely in there and cron.daily had an entry for logrotate. Anywho - IDK what's going on. Anyone have any ideas?
