From looking at the data I have access to, I'd say that things stop early on Friday afternoon in Ireland. So the Friday evening peak is lower than evening peaks on other weekdays: it's the only day of the week where the evening peak is about the same price as the morning peak. As you haven't provided the metadata of the data you're using, nor links to find that out, I've looked at the SEMO data I know about. The Single Electricity Market Organisation (SEMO) for Ireland gives prices by trading period (half-hours, starting at midnight), for every day of the year. So I took a 3-month period at random, 1 Feb - 1 May 2015, and looked at the average price for each half-hourly period, for each day of the week. Note that this is a simple arithmetic mean: there's no weighting by volume, no special handling of public holidays, no weather adjustments. 

No, the above calculations are not a valid way to compare cost of these curencies, for exactly the reason you state: a cryptocurrency is just worth what someone is willing to pay for it. They don't have intrinsic value. Cryptocurrencies are inherently wealth-destroyers, they are not wealth: they require resources to construct, and then just act as ponzi schemes thereafter. So their only value derives from the number and purchasing power of the people that can be fooled into buying them. 

It is. And it is not. Electricity markets are generally not set up for the demand-side to do much active participation at all. So the short-run demand curve as seen in, for example, Nordpool Spot, is almost perfectly inelastic. Not quite, because there are some large industrial demands that exhibit some elasticity, and are exposed to the spot market. But a very large chunk of demand isn't exposed to the spot market at all; and a lot of the demand that is exposed, is highly inelastic - particularly to half-hour-by-half-hour changes. That tells us a lot about the structure of the markets, and only a little about the actual underlying demand curve. Until there's a lot of demand-side response (DSR), we've only got stated-preference studies and DSR pilots to go on, to estimate what the demand curve would look like in a well-functioning market: the evidence we have (e.g. from the Olympic Peninsula study), suggests there's quite a lot of potential demand elasticity out there, just waiting to be harnessed. Note that when short-run demand elasticity has been observed, it manifests in two ways: some demand will move between half-hours that aren't too far apart, when the price differentials incentivise it. Some other demand will just vanish altogether when prices rise. If you want to try to distinguish the elasticity signal from all the noise in the existing market, then you need to take demand and prices for a particular half-hour slot on Tuesdays-Thursdays in one particular season across several years; and look at how weather-adjusted demand varies with price, while adjusting for any long-term trends. 

You've asked a rather broad question. In a way, what you've asked, is "how do we learn?" more than one tool for the job Do you believe in circular saws? Do you believe in handsaws? How can you believe in both, when they both claim to do the same job, but are completely different things? how not to pick an economic philosophy At our worst, we humans pick an economic philosophy based on whatever suits our prejudices. So, for example, some people love Hayek, because he gives them a pseudo-intellectual justification for being selfish pricks. Some people love Hayek, because he offers an internally-consistent logic and offers the (false) hope of being able to ignore all the complexity in the real world in favour of some simple rules. Others love Marx or Friedman or some other icon for equally bad reasons. the thing that makes it dismal, is what makes it so interesting Economics done well can be a science. It's a pretty dismal science, and one reason for it being dismal, is that we rarely get chance to carry out controlled experiments in lab conditions; and even when we do, we know that the very fact that they've been carried out in lab conditions is very distorting, so we only learn something distorted about the real world. Another reason it's so dismal is that whenever we do empirical observations of the real world, the observations are very distorted, the effects we observe may only be weakly linked to what we think are causes, and there can be quite a time lag in between, during which lots of other things happen that might interfere with the result. more than one tool for the job (reprise) Another analogy. Something unknown is concealed inside a black box. Over time, we manage to implant some lenses in the fabric of the box, so that we can see what's inside, through each lens. Each lens is heavily distorting, and dirty, as well as looking in from a different angle. The inside of the box look completely different through each lens. Is one lens right and all other lenses wrong? How can we make sense of it all? The Austrian School is one lens; the neo-classical another; and so on. Here's an analogy that Ben Goldacre wrote recently, for epidemiology; and it can be equally true of empirical economics: 

global The Dutch energy system is small enough that the ripples to the global supply chain will be very small. However, it is looking possible that there might be some temporary tightness in the global PV module supply chain coming up, after years of capacity expanding faster than demand, so there might be a price-spike up, there, if the Dutch go for rapid PV deployment 2015-6. Conversely, there is a bit of a dip coming in the global offshore wind pipeline, so the Dutch might help there; they do have a deployment pipeline set out to 2023, so one approach would be to accelerate that to deliver all of those windfarms by 2020, smoothing the work of the global supply chain, and reducing wastage there. But the Dutch energy system is small, and so all of these consequences would be small at the global scale. The much larger potential impact is that of the ruling itself, on other countries. This successful application of tort in one country may well prompt similar cases in other countries, as tort is a principle found in legal codes around the world. Further successful tort cases might help push the world along the decarbonisation trajectory much faster than it is at present. Now, as there is a non-negligible chance that business-as-usual could result in the destruction of much of the global economy, the option value of reducing the probability and scale of that wipe-out is very high; so the ruling may yet have very high, very positive economic consequences beyond the Netherlands. overview In many ways, the Dutch are about to go through, at small scale, what the rest of the world is about to go through at much larger scale. We've known for about 30 years that almost-complete global decarbonisation was necessary, and that the later we left it, the more expensive it would be. And then there was very little action in most countries. So now, not only do we have to decarbonise in about half the time we originally had (which will thus be more expensive), but we'll also have to spend a huge amount on adaptation too, as a lot of global warming is already in the pipeline and almost completely unavoidable over the next 40 years. costs, benefits, prices, quantities The negative externalities of the current system outweigh the benefits; so once we've transitioned away from fossil fuels, we'll be more economically efficient that we would otherwise have been; but there are short-term costs attached to that transition, and so resources will be diverted from other activities and into an accelerated transition. The accelerated action required in the Netherlands 2015-2020 will be to temporarily increase prices for the mitigation measures deployed; and those prices will then, post-2020, be lower than they would otherwise have been, as the supply chains will have expanded. Regarding demand for oil, coal and gas: they are all internationally traded commodities, so a decrease in Dutch demand will add a little downward pressure on their prices across Europe; however, Dutch demand is a small proportion of total European demand , so this price effect will be very small. The Dutch have been investigating various forms of road pricing for around 30 years; and planned out to some detail. So we may see some version of that finally implemented. Now, that would be more economically efficient in the long run: fossil-fuelled car travel has a lot of externalities in addition to greenhouse gas emissions. But in the short run, there are additional costs as land-use patterns change, and people change where they shop, where they live, where they work. 

The deadweight loss from fossil fuel consumption is the red striped triangle: this comes about because fossil fuel producers do not have to pay for their pollution, leading to a competitive advantage, and an artificially high quantity sold Q1 at price P1. This inefficiency can be corrected (in long-run equilibrium) if the externality is priced back in - which is what the carbon price is intended to do. Given the presence of fossil-fuel incumbents, their lobbying power, and their decades of direct and indirect subsidies, it is highly likely that a carbon price set at the marginal social cost of carbon would be an insufficient signal. A very helpful one, but insufficient on its own. 

It should not be at all surprising that different people choose different offers: the short-stay accommodation market (let's say 1-30 nights) is characterised by a great deal of product differentiation and yield management. Airbnb has reciprocity at play, as guests and hosts switch roles. Additionally, hotels and airbnb hosts have different cost structures and different business models. Furthermore, consumers have different amounts of information: bounded rationality and satisficing are at work. So even if the offers were identical (they're not), and people's preferences were identical (they're not), then people would still make different decisions. product differentation Although you always prefer a lower-cost hotel-room to airbnb, some other people will prefer airbnb, even when presented with identical information. That's because they are not identical offers: they have many different characteristics (flexibility, physical space, presence of host, services offered, location, the P2P feelgood effect, doing business with individuals rather than faceless chains, staying in someone's unique home rather than just another clone room that looks almost identical in most of the world). And different people weight those characteristics differently: no two consumers have identical preferences. yield management Different people will also be booking at different times, with varying flexibility. Hotel rooms, (like airline seats), are one of the paragons of yield management, used in many textbooks' explanations of it. reciprocity Because with airbnb hosts can become guests, and guests can become hosts; and because reputation plays a major role in the market, there is reciprocity at play: both sides are incentivised to deal fairly with each other, rather than the practice of many hotels of making repeated attempts at getting more and more money from the customer from additional goods and services sold in addition to the basic accommodation, sometimes by using deception in the initial offer. cost structures On the supply side, airbnb and hotel rooms have different cost structures: an hotel room that's empty for the night is a wasted asset, and there may be little opportunity to reduce associated costs. Whereas a home without an airbnb guest is still a home, the residents get to have it all to themselves, and don't have to do any additional hosting, laundry, cleaning or tidying. business models A hotel's entire income is dependent on it renting its rooms out and selling associated services. For an airbnb host, the airbnb income is usually an additional source of income, a bonus rather than the thing that keeps a roof over the head and puts food on the table. So there is not an urgent and immediate need to find a guest, allowing them to set higher prices and tolerate a lower take-up. 

We're creatures of asymmetry. We're loss-averse. And we're not particularly rational, a lot of the time. So, to be able to do things like real-terms wage reductions, it's much easier to implement a freeze in nominal wages within an environment of positive inflation, than nominal reductions within an environment of zero inflation. So some inflation allows for relative and absolute adjustments in remuneration of different jobs. But too much inflation creates too much uncertainty and instability. So, 2-3% is currently considered to be "goldilocks" inflation within developed economies: neither too much, nor too little, but just right. Other places, and other times, have had different ideas. 

What would happen in the event of a "Leave" vote in the referendum? Well, the pound would quickly fall in value against its major trading partners - and some falls have already happened as the "Leave" vote appears to increase in probability. That makes imports more expensive, which is directly inflationary. Which pushes the Bank of England (the UK's Central Bank) to raise interest rates in response. On top of that there are second-order effects which would pull in the other direction, but over a longer time period: there's the directly deflationary effect of the significant increase in unemployment. And the increased risk of further disintegration of the EU, with all the consequential risks to peace and prosperity that that would bring. And as Alexis L. points out, the UK leaving the EU adds significant risk to the UK's currency; and that corresponds to a need for a higher return on the currency: that return is the interest rate. That's because if interest rates are too low, then people would keep selling the pound sterling, and it would keep dropping in value, pushing up inflation (requiring higher interest rates), and harming UK companies that rely on exports (creating political pressure to do something about the exchange rate - and that "something" is higher interest rates).
