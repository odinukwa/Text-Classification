These are hard on your body. In order to keep increasing the amount you can lift, your body will need to use increasing amounts of energy. A common suggestion with these programs is to eat to support the program. Meaning try to out-eat a stall. That only works for so long. You can use the pictures in Leigh Peele's blog for visually estimating body fat. Above 30% body fat, it's pretty useless to guess by site. Visual estimation is about as accurate as most other common forms of BF testing. The bottom line is that the more you cut, the more your body will have problems trying to adapt and get stronger. 1800 Calories is the absolute minimum I would recommend you trying to eat in a day, and that only on rest days. I would recommend 2000 or 2100 on training days. If you try to get most of your Calories in protein form, you will do better trying to lose fat. Do have carbs after you train, but don't overdo them and keep them low on rest days. Consider adding HIIT to help speed up fat loss. High Intensity Interval Training such as Tabata style sprints, or other body weight exercise will also help. Just don't try to over achieve. Too much of this will affect your lifts. Personal Experience I gained weight, but lost fat while doing StrongLifts and Starting Strength (consecutively). This lasted for a good while, but 5x5 was a bit much on squats when I got to where you are now. I switched to Starting Strength (which is 3x5, and swaps power cleans for barbell rows) about that time. This helped me push myself for another couple months. I managed to get to 310 lb squats before I had to switch to a weekly progression program. The suggestions above coincide with what I did at that time. Resist the urge to do a deep cut--particularly while lifting heavy. Only cut enough calories till you see the results you are after. 

For myself, I found that strength training allows me to improve all my health markers, is remarkably low impact, and helps increase my work capacity. I started strength training at around 39. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I get the impression that you have some unrealistic expectations of what you can do right now--particularly on a severe Calorie deficit. You're 3 years away from your former endurance exercise self (arguably with a much younger body). You are going to have to rebuild a little at a time. Don't try to rush back to where you were. You may or may not be able to get back to your former athletic abilities, but it's definitely not going to be overnight. 

I've gone through a number of times in my journey to a 445lb squat where I had to take weight off the bar and refine my technique. The first is where your squat is now, then again in the 300s. And again in the 400s. My squat is a lot better now than it was during starting strength. When I finally get my squat over 500lbs, I can say the same about my squat being better then. While I have mad respect for Rippetoe, and his Starting Strength book is one of the best strength training books out there, particularly for beginners, I found his squat cues don't help me. Here's some points that have helped me: 

The best thing you can do is compare your current training to your previous training. If you are making progress, great! Keep doing what you are doing. If you aren't making progress towards your current goals, then use those logs to analyze why not. 

There are two main hazards for your hands when gripping things: developing callouses and blisters. If you have blisters (area of skin covering a pocket of puss), it is because you are letting the implement move in your hand. The way to minimize callouses and prevent blisters is to learn how to grip the implement so it doesn't move in your hand: 

If you are looking to improve your quality of life along with keeping the time for training down, then you want to focus on compound movements rather than isolation movements. Compound movements work entire muscle groups together in the proportions that they are meant to work. They are more effective to build strength. Isolation movements are more for bodybuilding or rehab. Yes, there is a reason to do isolation outside of trying to shape your muscles. A good program will have the following components: 

Whether you play basketball, run marathons, swim, or left weights, all of the above points help you achieve general fitness. The activities that go into becoming fit include exercise, stretching, skill work (drills, playing, practicing technique), and good nutrition. The question isn't so much what you don't want to do, but what you are willing to do. You have some equipment--the adjustable dumbbells--at your disposal. You can use those to help build strength and conditioning. I'm going to assume you are a complete beginner, so anything will help. Here's an example program you can do: Workout A 

The first step is determining if there are any gyms that specialize in the type of lifting you are after. If there is a power lifting team that trains in that gym, or if it is a gym that is known for where competitors lift, typically they will allow coaches to train there without hiring one of the gym's personal trainers. In my area, I would have to travel pretty far to do that. Another option is a Crossfit gym. While Crossfit has a reputation for sacrificing form to have what seems like a million reps of a barbell exercise, that does not mean that a local "box" wouldn't have qualified instructors. They will be better than personal trainers at most commercial gyms. Starting Strength teaches a 100% Raw power lifting style for the big three: squat, bench, deadlift. It adds two more main lifts to your repertoire: overhead press and power cleans. Of these, the only one that might require the most hands on help would be the power cleans. When looking for coaches, keep in mind what it is you are trying to learn. A less expensive, and still perfectly valid approach is a form check video. Most phones have a video camera built in, and hand held video cameras are also fairly inexpensive. They let you take a look at your form afterwards and make corrections. If you still feel there is a need for an outside opinion, you can post a form check video to a forum that specializes in strength training. 

I've learned a lot over the past couple years, including what I previously held as true and now have learned is very incomplete. So let's start with the big picture, and get down to a more specific answer to your question. Basics At the very core of understanding how the body makes use of nutrients is identifying what the nutrients are: 

Chad Waterbury's article on the Pullup/Lunge/Pushup 60 day challenge sheds some more light on the last bullet point. In short, it all started out when a guy Chad was coaching said that the more pushups he does, the leaner he gets. Essentially, High Frequency Training (HFT) is very effective for body transformations. The PLP challenge is designed to maintain decent shoulder health and overall body work. The way it works is you start out with a set of 1 or 10 (depending on how many pullups you can do at once). 

Remember, fat loss is done in the kitchen. Muscle building and conditioning is done in the gym--and it's best done with real and tangible goals in mind. Keep your first goals reasonable. When you hit that goal, increase them a little more. It's that process of beating goals that makes the gym fun. If you go in without any real goals, or goals that are too far in the distance, it demotivates you and you lose interest. 

It's not so much a question of either/or, as much as it is when you graduate from one to the other. Many lifters agree that using DOH as long as you possibly can is best. However, when you can't get the bar to budge at all, simply switching to a stronger grip may be all you need to get the bar off the floor. 

Tensile strength is usually measured in PSI (pounds per square inch). Look for barbells with at least 155,000 PSI and if you can afford it, over 185,000 PSI. If you are in America, the best value for your money is going to be from Rogue. They have a number of bushing bars with 185,000 PSI or better and a price range of around $250-375 USD for those barbells. Because of the volume of business they do and the fact that they are situated in the middle of the US, their shipping prices are among the best you can get. In the US, mid-range barbells typically cost $250-$400 for bushing bars and $500-650 for bearing bars. If the Clean & Jerk, and Snatch are not your primary lifts, then consider bearing bars a luxury. However, if they are your primary lifts, consider it a necessity. In the UK, it seems like the cost of all gym equipment has the same numbers, but it's in Euros or Great British Pounds. That means they cost twice as much as they would in America. It's not fair, but they guys I know who live over there have all reported the same things. If you are elsewhere in the world, hopefully you can use this information to judge between the brands available to you where you are. 

Unfortunately, not all bands are the same. If the cord is made for the purpose of exercise, then the band simply won't stretch anymore if you are at the end of its elasticity. I can't tell you what that length is for the cord you purchased. I use "Iron Woody" bands, and the loop is about 4 ft. These bands can easily handle the type of exercise you are talking about. In fact they can also be used for accommodating resistance for barbell exercises. There will be no worry about the bands breaking under normal use. Again, I haven't handled or examined the bands you purchased up close. If they do break, the chance of serious injury for your resistance band exercises will be very low. I recommend testing out the stretch by the exercise you described. They won't break on the first use. If they have reached their elastic limits and prevent you from doing the exercise you need to do, I wouldn't trust them to maintain integrity for very long like that. However, if you can perform the exercise and they feel like they can handle even more stretch you will be OK.
