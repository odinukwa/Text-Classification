Broadly, the simplest and quickest way to answer 'What happens if X happens to a human?' Is to simply do X to a human. Does my new treatment for radiation poisoning work? Real world: Let's figure out a way to model this on a cell culture, then test it on animals and make sure it's safe, then finally the next time there's an accident we'll try it. Psycho world: I dunno, let's throw a prisoner into the reactor and find out! Your secret society probably falls into category B. Any experiment to find out what happens with a human in X conditions will fit your needs. 

Given the definitions you've provided the only real difference is that in one the leaders are in place for life, while in the other the leaders are only in place for a term or two, based on votes. With that in mind there's one rather crucial disadvantage an autocratic society has: it's bad at dealing with particularly bad leaders. In a democracy, if you don't like the Prez, you can just wait 3-4 years and vote them out of office. Impeach them, if you're impatient. Bring in a new Prez, maybe they'll do better. In an autocracy, if Le Roi is a fool, you can either starve while he runs amuck eating cake for 50-odd years, or, well, I suppose you could burn the regime down and invite a whole lot of people to meet Madame Guillotine. This is... less than ideal for the advancement of science. We can only speculate how much was lost when Antoine Lavoisier had his head lopped off. In reality we're never going to get a good leader 100% of the time. For every Sun King there's a Louis XVI, and for an absolute leader, their failure is absolute. 

Use them like sheepdogs, if you have 1 dog per 5 combatants, you'll be fine, and can probably accomplish your goals without any real casualties on either side. It sounds like you plan for them to kill people, but that might not be necessary considering they're huge, presumably intelligent, and made of wolf... 1000 of them circling an enemy whilst your army just sits and sharpens its swords, would probably cause the most hardened soldiers to give up. You'd have to give them armour so they couldn't be shot, but that'd just make them look even more daunting to your opponents. Really it sounds like the other kingdom would bend the knee relatively quickly, unless you weren't actively trying to annex their lands - but if you're expecting combat I assume you're going to take them out. The odds of them attacking you with your army of wolves are pretty slim, I think. 

Anything is possible. Instead of them being wiped out by a great war, their quantum computer could have predicted what the eventual outcome of their technological improvements would be, and they could have decided to restore the Earth back to its former glory using their advanced equipment, and then dispose of all their technology by launching it into the sun, before returning to their hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Perhaps the computer that convinced them to do this, was not destroyed, and was placed on the moon instead, and watched over the humans for the next couple of thousand years, to ensure they didn't entirely collapse whilst regaining their place in the natural world - this could be where the myths of God came from. 

You may not realise, but animals no more run by instinct than do humans. Like humans, they too have needs. These needs are served by the Animal Court, lowest of the heavenly courts. Formed from the descendants of twelve virtuous animals (the animals of the Chinese zodiac) the Animal Court convenes twice a year and attends to the administration of the animal world, hearing pleas and grievances and communicating them to the higher courts. Being an official of the Animal Court has its privileges: members of the court are permitted to remove their hides and live as humans while the court is not convened, conducting ourselves as they see fit so long as we do not become derelict in our duties. However, we animal courtiers are feared by humans; Werewolves, wicked humans so cruel they were demoted into bestial forms for their crimes, also wear the skins of animals to savage their fellow humans. Alas, not all werewolves take the form of wolves. Unfortunately, most humans aren't able to distinguish between us and so both of us are hunted alike. In times past, the solution was to convene the court far from prying eyes, away from the cities. But now that humanity has industrialised and humans flock to cities like never before, it has become impossible to simply avoid humans as we once did. But even the cities have animals and the Animal Court is still responsible for them. So the question is: how can we still hold court without getting caught? A few notes: 

Start with drought, then famine, then civil war. Post apocalyptic levels of survival. You could have it so the neighbouring states refused to help for whatever reason, and have it come back to bite them in the rectum once they realize they can no longer safely traverse the territory. When they do try, the survivors who have become ruthless killers team up and attack them on sight, and have become exceptional at doing so. No peaceful solution can be negotiated, as the outsiders are painted as those who caused the situation in the first place - despite that not being technically accurate. 

This is a good question, and one that I've thought about quite a bit as I'm writing an AI myself. Firstly, I believe that intelligence is a very specific part of what makes us human, and is generally static - it reaches the best conclusion it can with the information it has, and its own criteria for 'best'. I think the difference between individual humans has less to do with intelligence itself, and more to do with the various chemicals/hormones being fed to our brains, which cause the nuanced differences between different people/animals by tweaking the ratio of our processing power between reflexive/instinctual actions based on short term memory, and the analysis of data that has been stored for future use. That's a basic explanation of the core of my belief regarding AI/intelligence, but it's hopefully enough to get my point across. Unless we are also simulating the effects of hormones & other influences, any artificial intelligence we make (or digitized mind we transfer) will be fairly rigid in its thinking - extremely logical (within its own scope of knowledge), but also extremely consistent in its behaviour. I think that within an artificial mind, emotions (if implemented) would quickly be evolved out, as they would consistently get in the way of decision making, and be seen as inefficient. Just like how we try and remove negative emotions, they would literally just do it (or not try to implement them in the first place). Baseline humans would maintain all the traits of not just human intelligence, but the entire human package - not just knowledge and problem solving ability, but what could almost be defined as the soul (the combined result of biological processes influencing the various aspects of deduction & reflection). I believe the baseline humans would be seen as a marker of our origins, and used as an anchor to the real world. Realistically these anchors may not be required, as it could be argued that the soul is generally causing more problems than it's fixing, and that there's a certain solidity to relying on pure intelligence, but if you're wanting a world built where they are necessary, pick any emotionally driven, subjective process, and imply that the artificial humans are unable to replicate it. You could even posit that the artificial humans are unable (or unwilling) to actually feel emotions, and so spend their time observing humans so that they can emulate these, and appear to act more human - a simulation of the soul, based on observation of the baseline. Again, I'm not sure why they'd want to do this, as it almost becomes keeping humans around to help with keeping humans around, but there's no reason their justification has to make any sort of objective sense - if they've got a good enough subjective reason, even if it has flaws in it, it should do the job. 

Oh, that's easy. Attack surface. If you have one mage you can put him in a garden shed (or equivalent) while he casts and the enemy probably won't get through your army before he finishes the spell, nor are they likely to nail him with an arrow. If they can it was a lost cause anyway. If you have twenty mages standing in formation to protect it's harder to keep all of them from being interfered with - a volley of arrows will probably hit at least one and ruin the spell. Putting them in a fortification would be harder too. 

The same problems that a normal one time pad face would be faced by our hypothetical Caesar. Namely, if you want to send me a message, I need to have: 

Have you considered folding spikes? Rather than trying to retract them into the body, perhaps instead the spikes fold back against the tail when they're not needed. Properly designed, the spikes can be made much safer folded back than fanned out. Imagine a razor - if you press your finger against the blade it will cut you, but if you stack five together so their blades are flat with each other they barely cut at all. Perhaps your creatures' tails fold back like that. Such powerful spikes also need maintenance- you can't just drop them and regrow like a porcupine. Culturally your creatures might let their tails blunt and only sharpen them for war (an adaptation to denser society). They may also wear clothing over the top to protect their spikes and others. More generally, consider why your creatures evolved such fantastic weapons - there may be arrangements of spikes (eg. forming a blade facing out) that provide utility for its ancient use cases without exposing yourself to too much self-harm. 

I don't think we can be certain we'd find technological/natural artifacts of their civilization, it's possible they didn't want any future species to find their technology, and destroyed it all when they knew they were facing annihilation - some sort of attempt at ensuring that future species wouldn't make the same mistake they did (or at least lessen the risk of it). Alternatively, they could have left Earth, and only left their dead behind, who were ritually buried in tar pits. Again, they'd possibly want to hide anything that might hint at their technological prowess, for ethical reasons or whatever. As to what may remain if this wasn't the case, I'll leave that for others to deal with. 

Think of the humans as being like cattle, it's not slavery as they are not enslaving their own people (maybe they are, but the humans aren't being enslaved). In the same way we can justify dominating other life forms for our own benefit, they would be able to use that same reasoning. It's no more immoral than our farms are, really, and just like how we gain benefits from taking advantage of other species, those same reasons could easily apply to aliens taking advantage of us. Perhaps humans are more able to survive in certain environments than the aliens are, and so it's cheaper for them to get us to harvest certain resources for them, than to develop technology to allow them to do it themselves. Perhaps our problem solving abilities are more fluid than theirs, they might have a very rigid society without the ability to innovate much, and so they are taking advantage of how we think. Perhaps they don't have the alienpower to perform everything they want to do, so they use manpower instead for their simpler tasks.
