He perhaps doesn't want you to lose your seat. At any rate since he has asked you more than once not to get up, I think the polite thing to do is to stay seated. 

Instead of focusing only those companies that use tools you would like to use but don't have experince in, find some companies that are in transition, they have work that you are qualified for and work that you will need to learn the technologies for. So you get the job you are qualified for and then after impressing them with your general wonderfulness, it becomes relatively easy to move to a role using the newer stuff. Also, consider smaller companies. They often pay less and thus have less choice in hiring so your lack of experience may not be as offputting, but they can help you get the experience you need for the job you eventually want. 

There are many things a manager might know about a person who has left that you do not. It is possible they offered to have him resign rather than be fired; it is possible he was quietly fired for cause. It is possible he was on a performance improvement plan and management was glad to see him go voluntarily before they got around to firing him. It is possible he burned some bridges when he left with some complaints about the manager. It is possible he had an affair with the manager's wife. You don't know. All you know is the manager does not want to work with this person again. That should be enough for you to stop pushing it. There is a ZERO percent chance that he will rehire the person given what you described about his reaction. Pushing this can only make matters worse and will erode your relationship to the manager which is never in your best interests. If the team resents this, then they need to get over it. If one of you objected to this person, I suspect that you would support that person's objections. The manager likely is obligated not to to explain why he objects to this person if it was from something that caused personnel issues in the past. So it looks more arbitrary to you. But it very well may not be. 

Seriously, the action you should have taken the first time was to laugh. keep this in mind for the future. You really need to expand your definition of professional beyond never say or do anything except work. It is harming your career. Thinking of them as behaving unprofessionally is counterproductive and wrong. Most of the best workplaces have a lot of informal teasing and joking going on. It actually generally helps productivity not harms it. Now you are in a mess that is harder to get out of than if you had acted appropriately when it first happened. First, none of your proposed actions are appropriate. Do not do any of them. Not knowing exactly the nature of the teasing, it is hard to say exactly what to do. Is this good-natured teasing just trying to get you to loosen up and become part of the organization or has this gone beyond that into actual harassment because you come across as "holier than thou" and they intensely dislike you and are trying to run you off. People can get very nasty when their first harmless gestures of friendship are ignored or turned away. It is hard to say if your current co-workers are at this point from our perspective out here in Internetland. Since you clearly don't understand ordinary teasing, it will be hard for you to make this determination as to how harmless this is at this point in time. If there is anyone whose judgement you trust at this place (or if you have a mentor), it is time to have a conversation in private with them about the teasing and what you should do in the context of this particular organization's culture. If there is someone whose judgement you trust outside the workplace, you could explain the details of what is happening and ask whether they think it is good natured teasing that you should positively respond to or harassment which is handled differently. If you have no one else to ask, talk to your boss about it and how it is affecting you and how you don't know how to get it to stop. Ignoring the problem will most likely make it worse as they try to get any kind of a reaction from you. In general when you are harassed (If you determine that what is happening is beyond the ordinary give and take of the office), the first step is to POLITELY ask them to stop. Under no circumstances get angry or yell. If you over react, you will be the person who will lose in the exchange. If they are decent people and they find out that this upsets you then they will stop. However, at this point it may not be likely, but asking politely and explaining that it upsets you is really the only choice. And you will need to move to the next step. The next step if they do not stop is to ask your boss for help in getting them to stop. If he is not helpful or downplays the seriousness, then you can either go to HR about it (which will make you a pariah at most work places, so think really carefully before you do this). Or you can move on to an organization that is less full of people who like to play pranks. And next job, ease up a little and laugh at them the first time. 

We had to regain the trust of a very upset client. All of the things you describe are good things to do, but for us the single most critical factor in regaining teh trust was passing on bad news or potential problems that have arisen immediately instead of hiding them as previous people had tried to do. Now you always pass it on with a proposed plan of action and then you make those actions work once they have been agreed to. 

This person clearly has a stong need for control. This has nothing to do with or your co-workers and your performance. This has everything to do with his personality type. You will not be able to change this behavior from below him in the organization. I had a boss like this too early in my career. I learned as much from him as I could (these people are generally very knowlegeable in their field or they wouldn't last long with this management style.) and then moved on to another job elsewhere. I learned a lot from him and so was able to operate at a much higher level than my pay grade when I moved on. So don't take it personally, concentrate on learning what you can from him (even if you are not making the choices, try to understand why he chooses what he does, that will still give you professional development) and move on to a more congenial enviroment (even an internal transfer could do this) when you feel ready. Oh and while you are at it, learn how not to manage others. 

I agree with @Tangurena , for most contact jobs. One case I would also like to share is when you work contract to hire and you get hired. I have several of these on my resume and I show them like this: Big Well-Known CompanyA - Aug 2005-Jan 2008 (Aug 2005-Dec 2005 - temporary hire working for Name of agency) This gets several points acoss, it shows the total time I worked for the well-known company and it lets the employer know that I was a temp to hire and I got hired and it makes sure the HR refernce check into my employment dates won't conflict with what I said on my resume. 

You have a few people who appear to senior management to have abused the system. Whether this is true or not is irrelevant, the perception is there. Moreover, the perception is that your group is the one that did the abusing, so your group will be under more scrutiny for abosultely everything from now on. It is hard to get a decision reversed when abuse is perceived. The proper steps would have been to deal directly with the abusers but your senior managers are cowards who chose to punish everyone who was not guilty as well. This is common in the corporate world, unfortunately. Everything is perceived a system problem that must be fixed by system changes rather than by dealing withe the few people who were causing the problem. There is unlikely anything you ca say or do right this minute to get this privilege back. However, you can design a campaign to get it back in little steps. First you have to fix the perception of your group as slackers who don't work hard and have to be more closely monitored. One of the things that makes people look like slackers is wroking less than a full 8 hour day, then going home and logging in and working for several more hours at night. People only see that you leave at 4:30 and don't realize that you actually worked until midnight. Same thing with working from home in general. If someone was working from home and someone tried to get an anaswer from him and he was not responsive, then the perception is that the person was not working. The more times that happens, the stronger the perception. The first order of business is to gain visibility for your group with senior managers so that they understand how many hours you work and that you are responsive to their needs. Now that you are all in the office, make sure to stay late and come in early (or at least be there for your entire offical working hours if you don't usually need to work more than 40 hours) and make sure that people see that you are doing so. (and by you I mean the team and the managers). Eamisl sent after hours are a wonderful way of showing that you are there and working. Make sure to respond to requests in avery timely manner especially requests from people senior to you. This means that you cannot afford to turn off your phone, email and instant messenger to concentrate. Right now, the perception that you are working hard and are supportive of senior management needs is actually far more important than the actual work. I know that sounds silly, but until you turn around your senior management's view of your team as slackers there is little else you can accomplish effectively in terms of changing organizational policy. Next be ruthless is weeding out the actual slackers, if any. It is interesting to me that this happened shortly after the new guy came in and started emulating the managers. (Sometimes managers have more unoffical privilege than workers.) So make sure this person is not the real cause by making sure he is producing. Same for everyone else of course, but since it came up right after this guy started doing it, he is the most important to make sure he is producing and toget rid of if he isn't. If you are a manager of this group, you need to ahve a serious talk with them about workplace perceptions and visibility. Once you have fixed the perception of your team being slackers you can work on getting the policy back bit by bit. First step, when you are sick, take leave, stay home and, most important of all, do not work in any way shape or form when you are sick. Do not work extra hours on other days to make up for sick time taken. This is cold season, so the impact on the work schedule should become fairly obvious fairly quickly. It is best if this casues a deadline to be missed. When there is a schedule impact, then you bring up that people stayed home because they were contagious and they could have worked except working from home is not allowed. Then you suggest that limited working from home when someone has a contagious illness is to the company's advantage and ask for a policy exception for this reason only. If need be point out that it wasn't the people staying hoem and working while sick that caused the earlier problem. Point out that management can monitor these people to make sure they are working. If they allow a limited trial of working from home when sick, make sure to produce some work that is visible while you are at ahome. Make sure to be available by phone, email and IM all day long and that if you need to lie down for a little while, that you tell your boss, that you will be offline for a few hours but will make up the time later in the day. In other words, if you get a limited priviledge back, make sure to show how responsibly your team is handling it. Another thing to do is to document when potential great hires turn down the company offers because there is no telecommuting allowed. Make sure to say in management's hearing that great candiate John Smith decided against us because of the telecommuting issue. You want management to perceive that this is an important thing for the company to hire the best talent. Once you show you can do small occasional things and show an impoact on ability to hire the candidates you want, then after some months, you can ask for full rights to work from home again. If the person who changed the policy leaves the company, you can ask after his or her replacement comes on board, explaining what you have done to make sure the previous problem doesn't occur again. 

If it were me doing the hiring, I would look first for candidates who had done night time support in the past. At least they know what they are getting into and whether they would be willing to do it again. I would also look more favorably on people who realy really know their stuff. If you have in depth knowledge, fixing things on the fly at 3 am is much less stressful than for the person who doesn't know where to start. I would look for people who go the extra mile in their current or past postions. People who know thier data model inside out, people who are organizaed and can put their fingers on teh tools and techniques they need to solve a problem quickly and people who have a track record of being a successful troubleshooter. In addition to some programming problems, give them some troubleshooting tasks to perform. Take one of those things that went wrong at 5am and see if they can find the problem. More important than finding and solving the problem (they are afterall not familar with the code base) is how they go about looking for the problem. Techniques I learned to test how they handle stress in the interview include (use these with care, they may turn off some good people): Use a panel of people all of whom do not react favorably or unfavorably to the answers given. If you give the person no clue what you are thinking, the interview becomes much more stressful. Ask some questions that you don't expect people to get correct. (it's a plus if they actually do get those correct as well) Disagree with a correct answer. 

You can start looking, but stick it out until you find something. You will have to be very picky to find something better and that means staying employed until you do so that you don't have to take the next bad job that comes along. Trust me there are much worse jobs than what you describe. No sense in going from the frying pan into the fire. It is however pretty typical to not be given training or even much direction and be expected to perform. In my first job I was told to just do whatever my predecessor had done and that I could figure it out from the files she left. Unfortunately, she had not left any. And while I don't care for bosses that yell, there are a lot of them, so you want to take your time to find the right situation. You can put it on the resume. People expect there to be some blips in the first jobs until you find what you want. The key is to make sure that you can tell them what you are looking for and to tell them that you made a mistake in selecting this job and why it didn't suit you without badmouthing the employer. That can be tricky I know, but it is a skill that is useful to have for the rest of your career. 

There are several valid reasons to want a position where you are overqualified that are acceptable much of the time. The first one is that you want to move into a different area in your career that will ultimately affect your growth possibilities. It might be the chance to learn a different but related technology (I might consider a DA position instead of a senior DA to learn Oracle instead of SQL Server). It might be a chance to get into a new business domain where there is more growth opportunity. It might be a chance to get into a larger company with more room for internal growth. This last is especially true if this company is one you ultimately really want to work for like Google. All of those are possibilities where you might stay long term at the company although you might be looking for promotion (which of course many people are). Another is a change in personal circumstances where the more advanced position is simply not possible for the foreseeable future. This is trickier to discuss and less likely to succeed but will still work depending on the hiring official, the job and if you are willing to admit the personal reason. A new mother who wants less responsibility for a few years might be easier for a hiring official to accept than someone who is seriously ill. The need to move to take care of an older relative might be a reason to do this. If the new area doesn't have jobs at the level you are used to, it is possible that only jobs for which you are overqualified are available. On the other hand, while you might go through more interviews to get a offered a job, when you do you will know they are willing to accommodate your personal need. Another reason is a limited job market and a job that is going away especially one for reasons beyond your control like a contract ending or a mass layoff. Yes they are going to have concerns that you might jump ship, but if the jobs in your area are truly few and far between, this could be acceptable. Another reason is that you have found you do not like the duties at the higher level and would be happier moving down the chain to a lower position. This is typically when you have been promoted to management and would prefer to return to the technical field. Moving to a new area could also be a reason to move downward especially if the new area does not have jobs at your current level. For instance a Senior Dev in the Silcon Valley might have trouble finding an equivalent position in say Martinsburg WV. But if your spouse has been transferred there, then people will understand that you will likely stay awhile even at a lower position because no higher positions are in the area. If the area has higher jobs, then discuss that you are trying to get your foot in the door at those companies and expect to move up there. They might be willing to try you out at a lower (and easier to hire a replacement for) position before giving you the more critical senior job. You might also address the money issue more openly than if you were going for a higher position. After all many are going to be concerned that you will be too expensive. And if you are looking at jobs with lower qualifications, chances are they will have lower salaries as well. Finally remember, the people who are unwilling to hire the overqualified screened you out before getting to the interview. So you do have a chance of being hired if you get the interview to be able to explain your reason.
