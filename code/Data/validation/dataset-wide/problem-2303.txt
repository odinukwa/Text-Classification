For that matter why don't you get a Jogger Shoe for you? When I had been to a running exped, I was told to get shoes with following Props: 

Dedicated Rope Markers : Spend some bucks and get a rope marker which is specifically engineered for this purpose. Worst case you might use the dental floss by simply stitching it into the sheath. All you have to do is get a sewing needle with dental floss. Thread/Sew/Work the dental floss around the middle of the rope, making sure that its through the rope's sheath and not through the core. Repeat the same till you find the mark large enough to spot. But this is advised only if you know how to do it, else you will end up killing the strength of the rope by tampering it's core. Guidance highly recommended. Marking the rope with a tape: I have seen some climbers, typically beginners that they use a Duct-tape or electrical tape and wrap it around the point where you want mark it. This works fine for an event/session or so, but as after a few passes through descenders and carabiners and other equipment, the tape goes. But this works for a day or two. And, I personally that it should to be removed when you are done for the day as you never know how does the adhesive in the electrical or duct-tape react over longer times. Having said the above, one should also consider that the tape can come loose over the time and use and obviously shift its position. 

Adding to what Don Branson said, Try not to dismantle or peep into a pile of stones, small cracks. With reference to :"During winter, do most of these reptiles go in some sort of hibernation, or can some/many still be found and seen during the day where there is some sun?" What I've observed is, It is most likely that you may come across a snake/serpent during the early hours of day. They do get out around their hibernation place for Basking. And when irritated during Basking times in winters, they are slightly more aggressive than usual conditions. Apart from this, during bright day light, they tend to stay out of trouble. So I believe you need to be more careful during the early hours of day i.e 2-5 hours after the sunrise. 

And, what I do is, I regularly take them out, like once a month or so, cloth them a bit and pack them again. 

I have always felt uncomfortable when it is about asking people do go for a particular trek, and sometimes the asking them otherwise. 

Firstly, prefer to wear the clothing which is already treated for tick prevention by means of some tick repellent solution. The solution is supposed to contain Permethrin. Spray shoes, boots, socks, pants, sleeves, gloves, kerchief, and hat. Keep the sprayed items away from your pets (if any) for their own safety. Insecticide and Pest control Products that contain Permethrin are only for spraying on clothes and gear and not to be sprayed on human/animal skin or any external use on the skin in diluted form either. The wiki about Permethrin does say that Permethrin is used in medicines but that is in a different context from what is being discussed here. Wear long pants. Preferably light-colored. That will make spotting a tick easy. It may look a bit odd, but do tuck pants into socks. Wear long sleeved shirts. Tuck shirt into pants. This will prevent a tick from crawling under clothing. Use the long socks with good elastic, or they may slip downwards exposing your skin. Else, you can tape them as shown in pic:

Cause of coloring: As you specifically referred to Groundwater, I believe it is most likely due to the Manganese and Iron contents in the water. Iron and manganese are common metallic elements found in the earth's crust. Water percolating through soil and rock can dissolve minerals containing iron and manganese and hold them in solution. Occasionally, iron pipes also may be a source of iron in water. Now when you fetch the water, it looks normal, but as you boil it, or even keep it for a while, over the period it changes the color since Iron and Manganese gets oxidized and change from colorless, dissolved forms to colored, solid forms. May be that is the reason to have the presence of oily substance floating over the water. In wells or other groundwater sources, the oxygen content is low, and so the iron/manganese-bearing water appear clear and colorless since the iron and manganese are dissolved. Exposing to air, triggers the oxidization. 

For from upto small leak holes to upto coin-sized holes, You can possibly use a Duct tape on the both sides. One more thing to add between the Duct Tape's point of contact is a filler like Some local Epoxy Compound product, or worst case a Chewing Gum (Chewed one :D). For a crack, you might just get it fixed by a Duct Tape. 

There are many if you can adjust with smell and fact that you are going to need to use your own urine for some or the other purpose. 

If nothing out of above, the best that you can do is, Give it to kids, let them learn! I learnt to pitch the tent using a similar kind of tent that my uncle gave me. 

I am planning a trek around Mt Everest. I intend to cut the cost as much as I can, because I'll be planning a more exhaustive expedition in the same region in a short while after this trek, so I just intend to plan this trek, spending as less as I can. I plan to so there by the month of August or September. I have a few queries to which I could never find a convincing answer so far from the resources that I tried. 

The weather will keep on making it cold, so I'll say as a preventive measure you should try and arrange something that can keep you warm, and then may be think about having something that keeps the whole tent warm from inside. Its always necessary to have a insulation between you and the ground, you can do that by means of using air mattresses and inflatable sleeping pads, these are convenient to carry. This was more like a corrective measure just in case if you fail to keep your tent warm. As an additional measure you can put a lukewarm water bottle in the sleeping bag before getting into bed. You can built a small fire in front of the tent at a distance with a flat rock set up as a heat reflector. Wake up once in a while and check if everything is good and in control. But IMHO, You sleep way better when not having to worry about your heat source sometimes. I do this when its absolutely cold, and I am no longer able to sleep. You could consider a newly introduced thing called a catalytic heater or this that are safe to use in an enclosed area, and are made specifically for car camping when things get cold. You'll need to take care of the ventilation though.
