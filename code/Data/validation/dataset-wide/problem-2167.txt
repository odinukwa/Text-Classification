Unfortunately, many organizations include sick leave in their basic compensation package, but then expect it to be used only under dire conditions. Also, some expect vacation time (which is earned, not given BTW), to be used only in week increments, not one day at a time. The trouble is, few of them are straight forward and actually tell you these things, so you situation is not that unusual. As an interviewer, I would likely accept an explanation along the lines of "I needed time off for family circumstances which I felt took priority. Management disagreed and had not explained their policy about taking time off for such reasons and let me go." If the company you are applying to has the same attitude, it will disqualify you, and you can move of to someone else who has a better attitude for a healthy home life. 

Yelling at work should be a very rare occurrence if it occurs at all. I can think of few situations where it would be considered even remotely professional, thinking of safety/emergency type situations that might require immediate reaction and bypass normal professional behavior. I do understand that culture differ, so in some cultures that answer may not be true, but in the US, I it just is not OK behavior. Now, I personally have been put into a position where I ended up being the one who did the yelling. It was for complete and repeated incompetent behavior where I was given instructions to get the persons to either straighten up and produce, or get rid of them, but without being given the authority to fire them, only instructions to get them to leave. In frustration, this resulting in yelling incidents. Regardless of the provocation, very unprofessional on my part, and absolutely apologies to all who were present and subjected to the incident, well, except the instigator who did not even understand the severity of the situation even after the yelling. Frankly, as a witness, I would have expected a similar apology from anyone else in a professional environment who subjected the workplace to such an act, or I would have left the organization. You are correct with your feelings that you should not be subjected to such an environment, either as the target of the tirade, or a witness. Such and environment needs to be corrected, either via HR as the company is risking hostile work environment charges, or by simply removing yourself from the place. The 2nd of those options is likely to be the easier route. One time occurrences happen, but any sign of a repeated pattern and you, or anyone, should remove themselves from that organization. All of that opinion said, what your describe personally seems like it may go beyond a typical anxiety reaction to a stressful event. You are describing more of an anxiety paralysis that may need personally intervention. Consider if your reaction might be beyond a workplace question and might cross into health. Think about talking with a therapist and what you describe may be crossing into PTSD type reaction. Not a diagnosis in the least, just saying that your reaction might be reason for concern and would be worth talking to a doctor or therapist for their opinion and possible coping techniques. They may well be able to help you with a few quick ideals to help you anxiety coping techniques if you do need them. 

Opinion based answer, but this is a very opinion based question: Is it ethical? Asking for opinion and everyone will have one from their own view. Mine, not really a matter of ethics. You have not signed, you are not yet under contract, so negotiations are still open. Yes, you agreed, but they also gave you time to consider. Is it reasonable? Different question, different opinion. No, in my opinion, it is not reasonable. Negotiate a salary you want to begin with. If a 2nd company came in with a significantly larger offer, that is different, but you specifically stated that your first negotiation was for slightly more, and this offer is again for slightly more by your own measure, not significantly more. So, you want to re-open off an agreed to salary for a minor bump. IMO, no. For a significant offer, completely ethical and even reasonable to go and say, hey, I want to come, but B just offered me a bucket of gold. Can you at least come close? To come back again without telling me you have another offer, would stretch in to unethical. And for only slightly more, regardless of if you told me why you wanted to re-open or not, now you are just trying to nickel and dime me. And if you are willing to do that while just trying to get in the door, then your are going to keep doing it, or keep looking to jump ship after you are there. Very bad precedence in my opinion. 

Local rules and laws and union agreement have an influence here, but typically random is not a requirement. Persons in authority can normally call for tests based on suspicion, with random names also included to prevent public knowledge that the suspect was singled out particularly if they come back clean. That is it is not uncommon for 10 random tests to really only include 8 randoms with 2 targeted people included. If in an position where employees are working under an employee handbook or similar contract, it would be normal to address such a policy change by a revision to that, and notification to employees would be by the distribution of the changed document, not by word of mouth disclosure. Random or even targeted test are neither unusual nor uncommon many places. I would however find blood tests to be unusual and of questionable legality, again depending on local laws and CBA's. Urine test and even hair sample tests are considered less intrusive and often are implemented unilaterally, and employees are often given the option of blood tests to refute results, but demanding a blood test is typically in the US something police cannot even do without a court order, so at least in the US one would have a hard time convincing employees that a company could institute such a requirement without consent. 

Inadvertent damage or access - the ability of unauthorized access to sensitive information or systems through automated processes. Uncontrolled or inadequate password controls - allowing too simplistic passwords, not requiring frequent changes or allowing shared passwords creates security risk for reasons X, Y, and Z. Delegation of temporary rights - Persons should normally have access rights at a minimal level needed for their nominal tasks. Additional rights should be granted by first logging in as themselves, then elevating through authorization. Too high of rights for a task are a risk because of a list of examples... and elevation for a task helps track who is accessing and why. 

Most applications I have ever filled out have current employer as a required and normal field, but also have a question like "Is it OK to contact your current employer/supervisor". References are a fairly normal requirement, however I have frankly only ever had my references contacted once in 40 years. Requiring a reference early in a process from a current employer with no provision that they not be contacted until an offer is made, hmmm, that would not be typical and might well be enough of a red flag to simply stop considering that organization. They are already demonstrating that they do not consider your rights and fall-backs a priority and are completely willing to poison your current relationships. That is not a good starting point. 

It then goes on to expound that yes, employers in the US have the right to record every keystroke you type on employer owned equipment. My former employer took this further, if you accessed personal E-mail from work, they could, and would also record that access information and use it to access your personal accounts in search of company private information and successfully defended themselves in a wrongful termination suite from information gained this way. If it is typed on employer owed assets, the employer owns it and you have zero right to it being private because you are no longer the owner, they are. This absolutely includes their being able to back door access your company passwords if they so choose. I was forced to write up an employee over this issue and their choice of passwords they thought was funny and undetectable. They were incorrect. 

For a legal answer you need to go to a lawyer with knowledge of rules in your location. However, at locations I have worked, legal staff opinions have been: If you access it from work, then work can access it. That is, if you log into an account from work equipment, then work has every right to capture your password and access the account to verify you are not stealing, spying, or in other ways doing damage to the company. The reasoning being they have not authorized you to use company assets for personal use, so by accessing the accounts, you have forfeited any right to privacy. I am not a lawyer, and do not know if these lawyers were correct, but that is the policy of many companies. 

I cannot say how this compares to other positions in Europe, but comparing to positions I have held in the US: 3 months notice on leaving would usually be well out of line here, but most places in US are employment by mutual agreement meaning two weeks is custom but seldom actually required by either side. A set penalty for illegal actions? I would consider that limiting your liability, not putting it high. Normal wording for things like that in my experience here would be termination and prosecution to the full extent of civil and criminal law. Non-compete, I have normally had to sign 24-36 month agreements. 12 months would seem generously low to me. But again, that would all be coming from a US perspective. 

These would be generic rules, written for general grading, not in response to specific issues, more the list of what you are evaluating for. Impersonal and available before you look into a situation, but also a living list that you add to as needed and would have potentially many more points. Your three scenarios you preface with fit nicely into the three points I made for them. Then, when you see something that concerns you, you already have a pre-defined category it fits is without it seeming like an immediate accusation. If however, the same person or group is behind many entries in many categories it becomes obvious even without accusing or being confrontational that they are an issue needing either much closer look or training. How well this would work depends on structure and willingness of people to work on it. Tact is definitely a tool that may not always work and no identities attached until needed in the reports may help keep it institutional rather than personal, at least until person correction needs to be addressed. Just ideas from how I have seen it approached. May or may not help in your situation. 

When reviewing someone's resume, gaps always require an explanations. I for instance have a 5 year gap in mine due to burnout, so I had to be prepared to explain it, and everyone asked. But, a gap, when you actually did do professionally related work, might raise even more eyebrows than just a break from the field as a reviewer may feel that is an attempt to hide or cover up. In your case, it is, though not for the more usual reasons like a position you do not want them investigation because of the ground you left under. Personally, no, I would not leave the position off. There are however ways you can handle it, such as addressing it in a cover letter or submitting more of a CV or more modern formatted resume rather than a classical chronological one. This would allow you to address the situation head on and preemptively, Something along the lines of in a cover letter stating, I was in industry X for a these years, but became convinced it was not the direction I wanted either for myself or society so have chosen to pursue other avenues with my skills...
