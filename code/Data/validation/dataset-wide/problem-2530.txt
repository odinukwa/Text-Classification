This translation appears inaccurate to me, since 'sankhara' here probably means 'thinking' rather than 'exertion' (although the practical meaning is the same). The terms 'asaṅ­khā­ra­pari­nib­bāyī' & 'sasaṅ­khā­ra­pari­nib­bāyī' are described in AN 4.169, which states per the translation below: 

I would answer 'yes', even though 'death' ('marana') for the puthujjana is generally very quickly followed by another 'rebirth' ('jati'). For example, your unexpectedly wife divorces you. You die from the self-identity (sakkaya ditthi) of a 'husband' and are soon after reborn, in hell (suffering), with self-identity as a 'divorcee' or 'alone'. This new birth (jati) takes some time, even if it is only the time of one or two thoughts. You learn: "My wife has left me", which takes about 3 seconds to think. Then you think: "I am now alone", which takes two seconds to think. Therefore, rebirth takes around 2 to 5 seconds, or more, depending on the complexity. For example, some people remain in denial for a long time when there is loss so rebirth may take a longer time for them, as explained in the Piyajatika Sutta: 

The Pali word ‘sankhara’ has multiple meanings dependent on the context. It can mean: (i) a conditioned thing (formed from various causes or parts); (ii) something that conditions another conditioned thing, i.e., a ‘conditioner’; (iii) the process of conditioning; (iv) the aggregate of mental forming, such as desiring, intention, thinking, etc and (v) mental conditioning/concocting by greed, hatred & delusion, i.e., uncontrolled disturbing mental proliferating. For example, shampoo is a ‘conditioned thing’, because it is manufactured from & comprises of many ingredients. When shampoo is applied to hair, a ‘conditioning’ process takes place, which makes hair soft, clean & shiny. Therefore, shampoo is also a (hair) ‘conditioner’. Examples of each context from the Pali suttas are below: 

In Buddhism, consciousness does not think. However, mind-consciousness (mano-vinanna) is required for 'thinking about thinking' because the mind must 1st be conscious of a thought before it can think about that thought. This said, Buddhism does not teach the other khandhas exist dependent on consciousness but teaches the opposite, namely, the arising of consciousness is dependent upon the other aggregates (SN 22.53; MN 38; etc). 

My answer to this question is obsession with morality prevents the eradication of self-view & liberation from the world. Morality views sense phenomena as "beings" ("satta") rather than as "elements" ("dhatu"). Even St Paul in the Christian Bible taught attachment to the moral law does not set the mind free. Imagine if the Buddhist teachings resulted in more bondage (upadhi) than Christianity? How pathetic & embarrassing would that be for the Noble Dhamma. 

Buddhist practise is about testing. You have to test the different methods for yourself. Ultimately, Ajahn Brahm is right since Buddhist practise is about giving up craving. If you wish to meditate in a specific conditioned way with a specific conditioned goal, that is craving. But giving up craving is focusing in the unconditioned, which is Buddhist practise. However, you don't have to believe me or Ajahn Brahm. Instead, try to watch your breathing at the nose-tip & see for yourself the results. In the short term, the mind will certainly become calm & tranquil but in the longer term the mind will become foggy, sleepy & confused. Beginners can certainly watch the breath at the nose-tip. This is a good method for beginners to have a taste of peace. But, after time, it will cease to bring results because it is too conditioned & too coarse. The very effort to intentionally keep the mind at one point suppresses the mind. In true one-pointedness (ekkaggatta), the mind's energy gathers at one-point after the physical body has been calmed & purified of mental formations. To purify the body, there must be openness of mind rather than suppression. 

Therefore, when a meditator does a long meditation & is able to enter into different world, those worlds are not just illusion, not imagination or not a different universe. Those worlds are mental states. As for Nibbana, this is also not illusion, not imagination & not a different universe. However, it is also not another world and not a mental state, even though Nibbana is experienced by the mind. 

Therefore, the above quote is probably saying something like: "from an unknowable beginning ignorance & craving have been producing the delusion of beings which cycles, runs & roams around like a monkey mind". 

The Z mind (not the 'Z person') was liberated before the termination of life. At the termination of life, there is no liberation because there is no mind, as follows: 

Enlightenment & the path to enlightenment (such as meditative jhana) is a higher & better pleasure than any pleasure that can be experienced in ordinary life. This is the simple, accurate & correct way to view enlightenment. Please refer to this link. 

As has been mentioned by Chris, the teachings in Buddhism about finding the right partner are not based in "romance". Instead, they are based on determining what your life goals & values are and then finding a partner that can fulfil/meet your life goals & values, i.e., a partner that shares your same goals & values. This includes things many take for granted, such as having children. There are occasions when two people are together, romantically, for many years and suddenly one person raises their want for children and the other person objects to this. Ideally, the matter of having children should be sorted out before beginning the relationship. Thus, Buddhism does not really recommend get "romantically" or sexually involved with a prospective life partner before determining whether that prospective partner is suitable. It may sound very unromantic & clinical but I assume it is like interviewing another person for a job. An employer does not employ a prospective employee until determining & assessing the suitability & qualifications of that person. Often, this is how traditional cultures operated. Parents would get together & assess whether a partner was suitable for their son & daughter in marriage. The Buddhist approach is similar, i.e., more rational or cerebral rather than "romantic". Once "romance" (sex) occurs, that itself starts to make the situation less flexible since two people become attached to each other sexually (with the various demands & expectations) even though they may not be suitable in terms of individual aspirations or temperament. Thus, Buddhism encourages the development of 'metta' (friendliness; loving-kindness). We should learn to relate to all people as 'friends' first; putting their welfare first. In meeting a prospective partner, ideally, we put friendship first. We become friends for a significant amount of time before committing to romance. 

American culture & American students; similar to how today American "Buddhist" teachers promote "liberalism" (even though liberalism is contrary to the Dhamma). 

The word 'unsatisfactory' means 'incapable of bringing true lasting happiness' (as found here in an alternate translation and in Dhammapada verse 278). 

The six mirrors are the six consciousnesses, which have a purpose of merely reflecting; The electric power points are 'manas', which have the purpose of thinking, decision making, intention, etc; and The bathroom cabinet is 'alaya' or 'citta', which stores emotions, defilements, tendencies, wisdom, metta, etc. 

The six elements (AN 3.61) The six sense spheres. (AN 3.61) The eighteen applications of mindfulness in relation to the eighteen feelings. (AN 3.61) The four noble truths. (AN 3.61; SN 56.31) Dependent origination (which does not explain life after death; MN 28). Three-characteristics (AN 3.134) Emptiness (SN 20.7). 

Most excellent. Beautifully spoken. Pornography misrepresents women. Natural women want to love & be loved and want fidelity (AN 6.52). Pornography is a lie & deception. It does not represent reality. 

Sexual misconduct is defined in the Pali scriptures as having sex with someone else's partner or fiancee and with those living under the protection of their parents or an institution (in the case parents, if the parents disapprove). The purpose of refraining from sexual misconduct is to not harm/damage existing relationships. Therefore, having sex for pleasure, using a condom, circumcision, masturbation & oral & anal sex are not, in themselves, sexual misconduct (even though some of these things can be unwholesome & unskilful). 

You obviously have not been doing anapanasati but instead doing an incorrect explanation of it by Goenka or someone else. 

There is a sutta (Iti 74) where the Buddha said a child can be morally/dhammically superior, equal or inferior to their parents. Here, the Buddha recognises there can be bad parents. 

Paramattha dhamma is an Abhidhamma term, meaning the 'highest' dhamma. The equivalent in the Pali suttas is called 'lokattura (supramundane) dhamma' or 'heartwood'. Such dhamma is related to not-self ('anatta'), emptiness ('sunnata') & here-&-now liberation-&-Nibbana. The Ani Sutta states: 

So when it was said the Buddha recollected his previous 'births', this was also the recollecting the myriad times in the past (before he was enlightened) where his mind ignorantly clung to things as "I", "me" & "mine". There are many videos on YouTube by Ajahn Brahm about past lives, where he claims he gives evidence of their verification. I recommend watching these or similar videos. 

'Complacency' would be a lack of urgency, thus a deficiency in wisdom. 'Sloth & torpor' is a lack of energy (tiredness) or mental dullness ('sinking mind'), which can occur in concentration development & thus a deficiency in optimum concentration technique. As for 'contentment' & 'complacency', yes, they could occur together when a practitioner is content with a liberating yet lower level of attainment, such as stream-entry or jhana. 

My impression from travelling in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand & Nepal is 'namaste' is Indian & Nepalese & not related to Buddhism. 

'Wanting' is the obstacle to jhana. The Buddha taught in SN 48.10 that jhana is reached by making 'letting go' the meditation object. 

In summary, the question is inferring there is a destination (i.e. Nibbana) without a path (i.e. enlightenment). The question ignores the special teaching of the Buddha, namely, the Four Noble Truths: 

These techniques were 'wrong concentration' or 'wrong absorption', as I explained, because they were based in craving for & attachment to a certain state of non-thinking or quiet. 

Since a Sotapanna does not have perfect mindfulness & wisdom, it is impossible a Sotapanna has perfect morality. However, a Sotapanna has intimate deep insight into the nature of craving & attachment, therefore a Sotapanna fully abides by the precepts via wisdom but may occasionally lapse in relation to trifling deeds, such as killing a mosquito or lacking perfect speech suitable for each situation. 

The Sangha refers to the Noble Sangha. The Noble Sangha teach Noble Dhamma. The distinction between Noble & non-noble Dhamma is explained in MN 117: 

It follows the non-understanding of anatta is not at the root of craving; even though the realisation of anatta, together with the realisation of impermanence (anicca) & unsatisfactoriness (dukkha), will end craving. If the mind realises the aggregates as 'worthless' (as described in SN 22.95) there will certainly be revulsion and dispassion which is nothing but the end of craving. However the realisation of the aggregates as "worthless" is not 'anatta'. It is 'unsatisfactoriness' ('dukkha'). In other words, ideas of "I" could still possibly arise even though the aggregates are declared as worthless (asāra). 

Buddhism teaches "non-suffering". The whole path is about abandoning suffering & its causes therefore to have any other motivation (such as to find 'happiness') will not actually work. This said, to not discourage people, the Dhammapada does explicitly provide the assurance that: "Nirvana is the highest happiness". The result of "non-suffering" is a bliss the ordinary person who has had only ordinary experiences cannot imagine. However, to imagine what Nirvana might be like, imagine the feeling of relief that occurs when you urgently need to & do urinate. This is a very blissful feeling from the release from suffering. Even the idea of "neutral" is better than ordinary happiness. However, when the ordinary person thinks about "neutral", they think about depression rather than lucid sparkling clear purity. 

Reference to the Upanishads does not exist in the Pali suttas. Only reference to the Four Vedas is found in the Pali suttas. The Buddha was not aware of the Upanishads and had no interest in the superstitious ideas found in the Four Vedas. The Buddha found the complete cessation of suffering, which is not found in the Vedas. The complete cessation of suffering occurs with the utter destruction of "self-view", which includes the destruction of ideas about "Brahma" and "Atman". 

The question here epitomizes the corruptions found in contemporary Buddhism created by a misunderstanding of the noble path & using meditation for self-administered psychotherapy. The Pali suttas do not refer to mindfulness as "the paying attention to every passing moment", regardless of the contents of those moments. 'Mindfulness' ('sati') is not the act of 'observing' ('anupassi') or 'paying attention' ('manasikara'). Instead, the Pali suttas refer to 'mindfulness' ('sati') as the act of 'remembering'; of keeping/ maintaining (wholesome) path factors in the mind & excluding unwholesome things from the mind. Also, 'vipassana' is not the observing of impermanence in a way that has no calming effect on the mind. When genuine 'vipassana' ('insight') occurs, the habitual mental effluents are destroyed via 'disenchantment' ('nibbidā') & 'dispassion' ('virāga'), making the mind completely pacified ('nirodha'). Once the mind reaches the 2nd jhana, mindfulness becomes automatic, i.e., the mind trains itself to do certain things without having to consciously (volitionally) pay attention, i.e. act. Mindfulness is only a means to an end rather than an end in itself. Its purpose is the development of a kind of "mind-less-ness"; just the purpose of saving money via working is retirement. That being so, there is no apparent conflict that needs to be resolved.
