One part of your argument seems to be: Premise 1: There has been little consensus among philosophers at any given time in the last few thousand years. (Implicit) premise 2: If there is little consensus at any given time, then the objective truth hasn’t yet been discovered. (Inductive) premise 3: If the objective truth, despite thousands of years, hasn’t yet been discovered by philosophy, then the objective truth can’t be discovered by means of philosophy. Conclusion: The objective truth can’t be discovered by means of philosophy. (Note: I doubt that Premise 1 is truer of philosophy than of many other disciplines (history, literary criticism, anthropology etc.); European and Near Eastern philosophers from c. 600 to c. 1600 AD had a consensus that God existed; contemporary analytic philosophers have a consensus that there are no such things as Platonic forms.) To say some proposition P is true is to say (unless you're a paraconsistent logician or some other strange beast) that any set of propositions including a proposition equivalent to not-P is false. So any discipline that makes statements can be characterised as 'negative', as you say, in a sense. But you seem to mean (sometimes) the stronger thesis that philosophy is only ever negative – that the propositions with which philosophy is concerned are all members of exactly one of two sets, one non-empty set containing propositions whose truth-value we can't determine (if this set were empty then we'd be able to know the objective truth, contradicting your premise), and another set containing propositions whose truth-values we can determine, and which all happen to be false. But this isn’t possible. To say that a proposition P is false is to rule out certain possibilities. But it is also to affirm the truth of certain others (such as P’s negation). If we rule out restricted composition and mereological nihilism, then we'd have to go with mereological universalism. But you also sometimes seem to mean neither thesis above, and instead that philosophy is just about finding better and worse arguments, where better and worse admit of degrees, rather than merely sound or unsound arguments, where soundness doesn’t admit of degrees. Whether this is true or not is empirical – depending on what philosophers actually do or have done. If it is true, we might explain it in two ways. We might, as you suggest, say that philosophy is a sort of holding basket discipline from which other fields emerge when the foundational questions are resolved – quite a popular view these days. We might also (and not in contradiction with the first way) say that philosophy is the discipline concerned with fundamental beliefs, emotions, intuitions, perceptions etc., which are often radically incoherent (I have a feeling this can also be turned into an argument against intelligent design). Like any rational discipline, philosophy is also concerned with achieving rational consistency. We might think, then, that it is a peculiar feature of philosophy (or maybe the humanities in general) that we do want to be more coherent but we don't want to be 'most' coherent, or more coherent or 'right' beyond a certain extent, because that would require us to abandon too much of what we care about. (As an example, moral nihilism is the most coherent meta-ethical theory; but we'd rather have the inconsistencies and complexities and consequently inevitable lack of rational consensus of non-nihilist ethics than the simple coherence of nihilism.) 

Alex, excellent question, here. I think Wigner's paper gives little defense to the Platonist case. It seems to me that he's merely saying "applying mathematics to physics is useful to us," but this doesn't quite lead us to believe that "mathematical entities are real," which is what the Platonists would want to say. This is why I think that: consider the possibility of stripping the theories of science of their mathematics. If we were able to do this, would we have any reason to think of numbers as still being real? I'm not sure that we would. Note that I'm not saying our theory would be better, or anything. It'd probably be much worse! You could definitely argue that keeping the numbers in the theory has value, that it's good; perhaps it's easier for humans to solve, or better yet, computers. Or maybe the theories are more compact with numbers. But if the theories don't actually depend on the mathematics, who cares, right? It's useful for me to think that I'm on just on a bus when I'm 35,000 feet in an airplane, because that helps me get through the flight without freaking out. But of course I have no reason to think that this useful thought has any bearing on what's real. This idea that I've introduced is called the indispensability argument, or the Quine-Putnam thesis. It basically says that we absolutely rely on mathematical entities to explain scientific entities, so we have just as much reason to believe in those mathematical entities as our scientific entities. A good thing about this theory that you don't even need to think that scientific entities are real to accept it. It just says that we should have the same confidence in mathematical entities as we have in scientific ones, whatever that amount of confidence might be (even if it's none). There are a vast number of criticisms about the original Quine-Putnam thesis, some of which you can read in that article or on the Wikipedia. One criticism was that some philosophers doubted that any scientific theory depended on math at all! However, just a few years ago, a paper was published where a brilliant philosopher, Alan Baker, found such a theory. You can read it in his paper here. So where do we go from here? If Baker is right, then we do rely on a mathematical property for a scientific explanation. Should we only place confidence in those mathematical entities (prime numbers?) Or all mathematical entities? Is that one example enough? Anyway, I just thought these sorts of thoughts and questions were relevant, so I decided to share them. I hope you find it interesting! 

It's often easier to argue on what someone doesn't believe than what they do believe. The straw man argument is characterized by a misrepresentation of an opponent's viewpoint to make for easier and more eloquent criticism of that opinion. In the following example from the movie “Thank You for Smoking,” notice how Nick characterizes Joey's position as "anti-choice" which is absurd and meaningless in the context of their original debate: 

In the political arena, those who are anti-abortion characterize their position as “pro-life.” In this way, opponents of abortion are setting up a straw man argument implying that their opponents are not in favor of human life.” In reality, the question behind the abortion debate is not whether or not human life is valuable, but when human life begins and what social values are jeopardized in undermining a woman's right to decide these matters. An effective way of debating and defusing “straw man” rhetoric, is by graciously and wholeheartedly agreeing with the opponent as much as possible. In a public forum debate about chocolate ice cream, Joey should follow up Nick's argument with an eloquent and gracious support for the value of freedom (ie: “I would like to thank Nick for the important values he articulated so eloquently; it's heartening to see that what we agree upon is far more important than the differences that divide us....”). Similarly, in the abortion debate, those in favor of a woman’s right to choose should graciously applaud the tireless humanitarian efforts and idealistic values of the “pro-life” movement. 

Amazingly, we already live in an age populated with sentient machines of human-level artificial intelligence. They're called human beings. There is no reason that the ethical principles we apply to conscious human beings should be denied to any other conscious machine. This question becomes a little more tricky when dealing with the intermediate stages between a machine that isn't conscious at all (like my laptop) and a machine that can pass the Turing Test (therefore assumed to be conscious). The question of ethical obligations toward intermediate stages of consciousness will prove be an extension of similar questions which arise regarding the ethical treatment of animals: Is it okay to kill cows for food? Is it okay to torture goldfish? Should cats be dissected in an 8th grade science class? Is it wrong to pull the legs off of a tarantula? Etc. Related to your original question (but different): How will we know when a computer we are dealing with is conscious? It is impossible to ever know if a computer is conscious for the same reasons we can't ever know if any other human beings are conscious. However, we have a great way of intuiting other people's ability to reason in complex ways and sense stimuli, so it's the kind of thing that we hope to be able to recognize when we see. 

Frank, you made a good observation about the similarities between traditional qualia and the flow of time. As I understand it, anything that we experience has all of the necessary properties of a quale. Since we experience the flow of time, surely we can find things that are similar in this experience to other quale, surely with it the problems that come up in discussions of other quale. Before I look into other similarities, let's first look at traditional quale, like color or taste. When I talk about the flavor of onions, it's difficult, maybe even impossible (for now, at least), to determine if that sensation is exactly the same as yours. And when I say blue, perhaps you're actually thinking of what I think of as red. As of yet, science hasn't given us the tools to compare these things. Personally, I think of this as the property of qualia that give them any weight, or philosophical meaning. If we could compare color, then who would about the quale of color, then, right? Sure, they'd still be experience just the same, but when I hear qualia I immediately think of the subjective, incomparable nature of experience. If we could compare things, calling them qualia would seem inappropriate. I almost define qualia as our experience that we can't compare. If we take this definition, then the ability to compare colors would exclude them from the class of things that are qualia. Anyway, back to time. When we the experience of time, it seems the only properties we could disagree on are the direction of flow and the rate of flow. Physics (in particular, thermodynamics and its irreversible processes) gives us reasons to think that time couldn't flow backwards. If you accept this as true (I don't think you need to, but you might be persuaded by physics), then you can only talk about the rate of flow. Could we disagree on the rate of flow? I think so. Perhaps what feels like an hour to me feels like a minute (how I experience it) to you. Allow me to take a break for a moment to discuss cause and effect. In the simplest form, cause and effect says nothing about rate of processes occurring. It refers solely to the direction of time flow. Accordingly, if you happen to be persuaded by physics that we physically could not experience time in the other way, then it seems that cause and effect loses that fundamental of quale: the inability to compare. If everyone experiences time in the same direction, and we know this, then who cares? It'd be like being able to compare colors above. Anyway, back to the flow of time. Up until now, there seems to be no reason to distinguish the experience of the flow of time from other qualia. But I'm wondering if it'd be possible for us to determine the rate of flow for an individual? Perhaps from something like brain waves or properties of your neurons? Might there be something which we can now observe that would lead us to think that someone is actually experiencing time faster. An example I'm thinking about would be someone who has faster reflexes than someone else. Now, there are at least two types of examples that could lead someone to have faster reflexes. The first is that they have simply have more neural connectivity that allows this person to perform a given activity faster. The other possibility would be two people who have identical neural structures, yet one is lacking myelin sheaths. Instances of the second sort seem more important to this discussion. In the first case, the electrons in the brain are traveling at the same speed, they just have further to go. In the second case, the electrons actually are moving slower. But the question remains as to whether or not we would experience time slower if the electrons in our brain were going slower. I'd like to think that it would. We have reason to believe that all our experiential processing happens in our brain, so surely if our brain was processing things slower that would lead to a sluggish experience of time? This hinges on electrons being the mediating particle in brain processing, which I'm not sure we have any strong reason to believe. But it seems possible. Maybe you disagree or are unconvinced. That is completely fine. I'm just writing some thoughts I found interesting and relevant to your question. I hope you at least find them interesting, if not convincing. =)
