If robots are so good at everything that they've entirely replaced low-skilled labor, it's likely that manufactured stuff is cheap. You say people still need to work to get by, but how cheap would it be to send a bunch of construction robots over to whip up a new tenement when needed? They don't need breaks or lunch hours, don't go on strike, presumably make near-zero mistakes, and don't particularly worry about their own safety. Are massive farming operations completely automated by these same tireless robots? What does that do to food prices? And so on. It seems very likely to me that a subsistence level of living would be widely available. Large swaths of people would probably be miserable due to a lack prospects for upward mobility, but they almost certainly don't lack for basic necessities. Shifting Labor Market 

This has been mentioned in a few other places, but it's possible that the fields that machines aren't able to do well, like music or art, would just... expand. If there's tons of wealthy people who have easy access to the things that robots can do, what do they do with their disposable income? Hire yourself an artist, or spend way more time going to things artists do. Get a nanny, or heck, get two. Maybe machines can handle fairly boring food for everyone, like going to eat at Ruby Tuesdays or something, but what people really want is their own human chef to show off to their friends! Or maybe even new jobs we can't imagine? Could Luddites have envisioned computer programming jobs? Maybe it becomes en vogue to have your own personal self-esteem person, who follows you around and tells you how great you are at every turn. Increased Productivity 

For actual forex you need a middle man, someone who has a personal understanding of the value of the currencies. Given that direct trade between ordinary people of either faction is unlikely as normal people don't move around, trade will primarily be through merchants whose livelihood is based on dealings with both, and who will have stores of both currencies. The rate you're going to get is more likely based on how valuable they are to him, not any absolute factor or practical value in the field. You'll probably get ripped off. Better to stick to shiny beads you can sell directly. 

You mean like these? In this case they're still just about visible but that was over a year ago. "Would it be possible" has already been replaced with "what can we make them do?" 

Firebreak If you're dealing with zombies then the principles of forest fire fighting apply. To put a break between what you can save and the incoming danger you need to create a gap with no fuel for the fire. You either remove or backburn the fuel. In this case the fuel is people. 

Initially consider it as time. There was a building before the one you're in and a building after it. All you need to be able to do is move between those buildings. Consider a co-ordinate system x,y,z,t. x and y are the ground level, z vertical and t your 4th. Just as you move between your building and the one next to it, which shares your x,z,t co-ordinates, by moving in y, you can move in your 4th dimension between the buildings sharing your x,y,z co-ordinates by moving in t. The only problem is moving in that 4th dimension when you only exist in 3. There can be an indefinite number of stacked Flatland planes of existence, none of them are aware of the others, none of them can interact with the others or pass between them. They exist only in x and y, they have no z and no understanding of z. But There's always a but. Your society has a 4th spacial dimension, so they'll use it as a matter of course. Flatland has no access to the 3rd dimension so you can stack Flatland planes without a second thought and with no issues. Your society is going to have buildings that already exist and have length in this 4th dimension, you can't just casually stack them like 2D worlds in 3D, you'll have to put them alongside each other. You'll also have to work out terminology and decide whether like left and right, you can just go that way or whether like up and down, it has a force and you need to have something to support you in "flight". Going back to the example of time as a 4th dimension, while we can't control our movement a building still has a length in time. A building may be 10metres x 5metres x 20metres x 100years, but they still exist and have a fixed length in that dimension. 

I know you said no religion in the comments, but I think there may be a middle ground worth considering. What about a society with an extreme value placed on human labor - Protestant work ethic sort of thing. You could relate it to an honor culture, where honor is strictly earned through your labor, and your entire civilization is one big culture of hand craftsmanship. They could still make some pretty amazing things, even plausibly these early computers. The assembly line is around; it's just fully staffed by humans. But the sort of high-tech tools required to mass produce densely-packed computer processors simply isn't possible. This way there's nothing that feels like a contrived "oh, god says no computers" and you rely on everyone believing it and not trying. Everyone can strive, with all their might, to advance what they can do. But advanced computers simply aren't on the table, because they don't consider things a skilled human can't produce. 

Think of productivity as the number of people working it takes to support everyone. Our standards of living can increase across the board as long as our productivity increases proportionally. That is, if some new innovation makes everyone twice as productive, we can basically double living standards for everyone. Likewise, we can reduce the number of people working as long as the people who are working are proportionally more productive. That is, if some new innovation makes everyone twice as productive, we can maintain living standards by having half as many people work. Then imagine how your society falls on this scale. Essentially robots have made productivity go off the charts. How that productivity gets used is what will dictate your answer. 

Notes: 1: The relative abundance of heavy/light elements vary as one approaches the central star in a planetary disc the same way the relative abundance of heavy/light gases varies with altitude. And it only takes a difference of a few % silicon abundance to radically change rocks' properties! 2: slowing down the rotation will diminish prevailing wind bands, but will increase thermal differentials at the terminator. Effectively, your trade winds and polar/equatorial easterlies will die off (less evaporation), but pre-dawn and dusk sea-breeze and shore-breeze will get stronger (more evaporation). Since I've got no idea which would effect evaporation more, I suggest you stay with our rotation and push on some of the other levers. 3: Unfortunately, you've probably just done big things to your magnetic field: your planet has a larger metal (core) due to its original abundance-profile, and it's spinning faster. YMMV.4 4: "Your Magnetism May Vary" 

We have the topography we do largely because of erosion rates, size of plates, and transportation rates. To generate a "rougher" planet you need to dial down erosion rates, dial down size of plates, or dial up transportation. (Or any combination of the three.) 1. Erosion rates depend largely on overall chemical composition and on hydrology. Briefly, to generate lower erosion rates you want your rocks to be more mafic (containing heavier elements) and less felsic (containing lighter elements). This is a matter of the composition of and position in the planetary disc that formed your system, so you'll want your planet to have developed in a region around its star a little closer than ours1. As for hydrology, you want a little less vigorous of a water cycle than ours. You could make the planet contain significantly less water: say, 20% coverage rather than 80% coverage. Alternatively, you could have the same coverage but slow down the water cycle by slowing down evaporation. (This can be done either by cooling the planet or by slowing down its rotational rate2.) 2. Plasticity of plates and other factors will determine how large your tectonic plates are. You might think it unfortunate that all of the factors in (1) that make your rocks harder and less prone to erosion also make your plates harder, but realize that makes plates more brittle, too. To break them up into generally-smaller fragments we just need to make sure the planet's getting kneaded vigorously: ditch any thoughts of a moon and give yourself a true binary planet system. 3. Transportation of plates arises from convection cells in the mantle, so we want to make sure those cells are more vigorous. Unfortunately, the chemical factors in (1) that make rocks harder also make magma more less viscous, so we've got to invigorate convection cells in another way. We can either crank up the (core) heat or spin up the differential rotation rates between core and crust. Luckily, if we're creating a planet closer to its parent than we are, then it was likely created in a region of the planetary disc more prone to energetic vortices, and it's not unreasonable for it to have a fast-spinning core. Couple that with a slow binary partner and we can imagine a slow crust and fast core creating vigorous--and relatively small--convection cells. Perhaps that'll lead to smaller tectonic plates.3 In summary, you've got chemical composition, water coverage, surface temperature, surface rotation rate, size of orbital partner, core rotation rate, core temperature which will all impact eventual geomorphology. I hope above to have explained enough of how each works and how they might interact that you can make your choices. There may be many more things I'm not thinking of or even aware of. Happy hunting!
