I don't think there are any general books on graphic design for geologists. However, there are some books about graphical standards for geological maps and sections: 

You are correct about the maximum value, you just have the easting and northing backwards. In your first example, the easting is 414668 m and the northing is 6812844 m. The convention is eastings first. You can think of UTM coordinates as $(x, y)$ pairs, and they are sometimes labelled as such. Here's the conversion offered by one converter:

Yes, it's called polar motion. The rotational pole moves continuously, as you can see from the right-hand side of this figure (below) by the Earth Orientation Centre (EOC) and the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). The figure shows about 650 days of time; is modified Julian day and time goes along the locus in the polar motion diagram. 

No, Steno's principle of original horizontality (I'll call it the POOH) is not 'safe'. It is not a useful theory. Don't confuse it with the law of superposition (also due to Steno), which is useful. That law is, in a general sense, a foundation stone (ha!) of stratigraphy... with some caveats due to resedimentation and other processes. Why is the POOH dodgy? On small and large scales, the concept of 'layer-cake' stratigraphy does not hold up. Indeed, it's probably rather unhelpful. Brian Romans wrote a nice essay on this subject in 52 Things... Geology (edited by me, 2014) — see the link below. In it, he refers to Bailey (1998), who described sedimentary bodies as 'lenticles' with complex 3D geometries. And you just have to look at some seismic reflection data from the continental shelf to appreciate that this principle applies to even an outwardly rather continuous environment (excerpt of a line in the Virtual Seismic Atlas): 

(Google around dinosaur locomotion for more!) I realize you can't do all of this sort of thing for a science fair, but hopefully it illustrates that, when it comes to hypothesizing about the past, we have to come at problems from a few different angles, using high and low technology. Hope this helps a bit, good luck with the project!! 

After quite a bit of conversation on Twitter, I think it's arbitrary. Tradition is probably the prevailing reason. It would be interesting to go back through the literature to see who first used it. My hunch is that it goes back to the Zoeppritz equations (Zoeppritz 1919), which feature both $V_\text{S}/V_\text{P}$ and $V_\text{P}/V_\text{S}$. I bet Aki & Richards (1980) also had something to do with its propagation, at least in the exploration geophysics community. Thinking about it, I think there are some good reasons to use $V_\text{S}/V_\text{P}$ instead of $V_\text{P}/V_\text{S}$. It's well-behaved As the OP said, $V_\text{S}/V_\text{P}$ behaves nicely, being constrained in the range [0,1) for rocks and fluids (and weird things like bitumen) — compared to $V_\text{P}/V_\text{S}$, which varies in the range 1 to infinity/undefined. I suppose you could call that 'neat'... It's a good gas indicator If you have a background of brine (say) and want to see gas anomalies, then my insufficient research suggests that $V_\text{S}/V_\text{P}$ is actually a better discriminator: 

Geophysicists spend most of their time trying to solve the inverse problem — deriving an earth model m (which is the interesting unknown), given real seismic data d (which we measured), and the parameters of the experiment, our understanding of nature, etc (G). So in a real problem, we wouldn't know that high-resolution velocity model a priori. So what was all that about 'requiring an estimate'? We don't go straight from the data to a high-res earth model. First, we have to build a seismic image, via a process called migration, which requires us to guess a rough velocity model to focus all the seismic energy into something we can interpret. We do this by choosing a grid of velocity-vs-depth functions that seem to focus well. Here's a pretty typical velocity model for imaging, from a Marmousi example by Tristan van Leeuwen (2012; UBC preprint). Notice how it lacks high frequencies: 

How much can you see? A large survey might be hundreds of square kilometres, or many tens of kilometres long in the case of 2D data. We can image well down to about 6–8 km, and we can image something down to about 20 km. The typical resolution of seismic is on the order of tens of metres horizontally and a few metres vertically (about a quarter of a wavelength). This is much better than gravity or magnetics. You might think, "Why not use higher frequencies for imaging — surely you'd see more?" Yes! We would love to use ultrasound (say) for imaging. The problem is that high frequencies are absorbed more efficiently by the medium (mostly rock and water) and actually heat it up very slightly. What can you find out with sound? In many cases, we can go beyond an image of the subsurface and deduce some physical properties of the earth, especially the speed of sound in the rock and the density of the rock. Sound reflections depend on changes in acoustic impedance, and are dependent on the incidence angle, so all the physics really stems from that relationship. What about acoustic logging? Acoustic logging or sonic logging is an important counterpart to seismic imaging, because the logs — run along a borehole using special tools — are the best link between the acoustic properties of the rock. They thus link us to the seismic image that depends on those acoustic properties. So we don't image anything with this data, because it's one dimensional, but it's a key calibration point. Acoustic logging does use ultrasound in the 20 kHz range, but the attenuation issue is not a problem in the vicinity of the borehole. 

While the terms are rarely used rigorously, AVO and AVA refer to slightly different versions of the same type of analysis. The amplitude (and phase) of a seismic reflection varies with the offset distance between the source and receiver. Hence 'amplitude variation with offset', or AVO. Strictly speaking, however, the variation — which is given by the Zoeppritz equations — is with the incidence or offset angle, often called $\theta$. That is, the reflectivity is a function of angle, not of distance. So 'amplitude variation with angle' (AVA) is arguably a better name for the phenomenon. It turns out that the reflectivity varies linearly with respect to $\sin^2\theta$, so we often use that relationship instead, e.g. via the 2-term Shuey approximation: $$R(\theta) = R(0) + G\sin^2\theta$$ where R is the reflectivity and $G$ is a function of P-wave velocity $V_\mathrm{P}$, S-wave velocity $V_\mathrm{S}$, and density $\rho$. If we're being strict about the language, the practical difference in seismic analysis is that you'd perform AVO analysis on offset gathers or partial offset stacks (such as you might get directly from processing), and AVA analysis on angle gathers or partial angle stacks (which would require you to interpolate the offset-based data using a velocity model and ray-tracing). 

On a wireline log, the horizontal axis is some physical property such as natural gamma-ray emission rate or bulk density. Check the legend. There's no reason not to represent other parameters with the horizontal axis (or the vertical one, or the colour), but then you'd need to be careful about labelling things clearly. Footnote: often colour is keyed to lithology. This may or may not closely follow the grainsize. Symbols may be added to represent other relevant characteristics of the rock, such as sedimentary structures and fossils. 

About 12 million BTU, or 3.5 MWh. I searched for paper btu and got loads... of... hits. Seems like 7000 BTU/lb is a decent starting point, or $1.6 \times 10^7\ \mathrm{J/kg}$. If we say a ream of letter-size paper weighs about 5 lb, then we can calculate that paper yields about $1.2 \times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{J/m^3}$ when burned — enough to heat the average US house for 15 weeks. 

If you don't take ice shelves into account, and only think about pack ice, you end up with about 0%, because pack ice is generally thinner than about 4 m, and so makes up a tiny fraction of global ice volume, in spite of its extensive area. But if you do account for ice shelves, especially the southern ones, the answer must be much greater. I have not done the research to find the numbers, but the text I quoted suggests something less than 7%, so I'm going with 5% as a first-order, round-number guess. Reference Kusky, T M (2014), Encyclopedia of Earth Science, New York Academy of Sciences, 529 pp. In Google Books. 

The last little gem is that, even if there's no luck exploring on the shelf, incised valleys might mean that coarse sediment has been delivered to the basin floor, opening up a promising play there too. 

What do you mean, 'sound-like'? I say 'sound-like', because we normally think of sound as a vibration that we can hear, conducted through air or maybe water or building materials. In seismic methods — such as we might use prospecting for minerals, oil and gas, water, geothermal resources, etc. — we use very low frequencies, typically in the 4–256 Hz range (about 6 octaves). You can certainly hear some of these frequencies, but not those below about 20 Hz, which are often the strongest frequencies in our signal. Why is seismic reflection such a big deal? From thousands of field recordings, usually shot in a grid over a land or marine area, we can reconstruct an image of the subsurface using a process called tomography. The data might be 2D (a vertical cross-section) or 3D (a volume, analogous to a CAT scan). In some cases, this image is excellent and reveals a great deal about the geology of the region. Here's an example from a paper by Moore et al. (Science, November 2007): 

Ideally you'd like to avoid having to estimate anything. Depending on the shape and orientation of the pier relative to the waves, you might be able to find some volunteers (at least 1 anyway) and space them out at approximately the right distance. Then get them to raise a hand when a crest passes them. Adjust their spacing until they are raising their hand at the same time. If the crests are simultaneous and there is only one trough between them, they are one wavelength apart. You might need to adjust for the angle of the pier, for example in this case, wavelength $\lambda$ is related to the inter-volunteer distance $d$ and pier angle $\theta$ as $\lambda = d \cos\theta$ 

Indeed, Darwin turned out to be correct that atolls often have a volcanic origin, but Cay Sal Bank is a counter-example. I think it's fair to say that most people would assume that origin though, and lots of Internet definitions , so it's notable if an atoll formed some other way, e.g. on a non-volcanic seamount (see Keating et al., 1987, in Seamounts, Islands, and Atolls, AGU), or by island subsidence due to dissolution. 

It has nothing to do with the geological cause of the tsunami. Instead, it's a result of the way waves propagate. You can see the same effect on ordinary wind-generated ocean waves — the waterline draws back before each wave peak arrives and washes up the beach. Tsunamis are much bigger waves, in terms of both amplitude and wavelength, so the effect is more dramatic. The particles in some surface waves, including wind waves and Rayleigh waves (a component of what is often called ground roll), have in a circular or elliptical motion — in the case of a wind wave the motion is clockwise if the wave is traveling from left to right (see this animated comparison for Rayleigh waves). The 'backwards' motion in the trough results in the drawback you are asking about. 

Finally, there are Edward Tufte's amazing books, a must-read for anyone interested in the design of scientific graphics of any kind. 

Clearly, some of those rocks have almost no contrast on one axis, and can only be separated on the other. Indeed, this sums up the great problem of seismic inversion — we would like to recover these quantities individually, but all we can usually get at is impedance. Another example of the non-correlation of velocity and density is the so-called "fizz effect": introducing a very small amount of gas in the pore-water, less than 5%, can reduce the P-wave velocity by as much as 20%, while having almost no effect on the density. The result: a substantial change in impedance (e.g. Han & Batzle 2002). The other thing about the product $\rho V_\mathrm{P}$ is that the impedance contrast at an interface gives us — quantitatively — the reflection coefficient $R$ at that interface (assuming vertical incidence; it's more complicated for other angles): $$ R = \frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1} $$ where $Z_2$ and $Z_1$ are the acoustic impedances of the lower and upper layers respectively. To go back to your more general question about intuition. I agree, the intuition is slippery. The analogy to electrical circuits seems obscure, and I daresay it does to other geologists. "High impedance" sounds to me like "lots of opposition"... so why is the velocity high in high impedance rocks? Perhaps because of this, I tend to focus on thinking of high impedance rocks as 'hard' and low impedance rocks as 'soft'. I find this more geologically useful. So I guess I don't have a very good answer for that part of your question. References Avseth, P, T Mukerji, G Mavko, and JA Tyssekvam (2001).

Your best bet is probably OpendTect. It's not quite what you asked for. OpendTect is a desktop application and does not use HTML/JavaScript for display. It is dual licensed; the free version is licensed under the GPL. It will read wells and seismic no problem, but I'm not sure about FMI in the free version. Agile started G3.js, a JavaScript library based on D3.js for logs and seismic, but we didn't get very far. (I'm the founder of Agile; I'd welcome a reason to start that project up again.) Agile also has welly, a Python library for well logs and lithology. There are lists of other open source tools for geophysics and geology on Wikipedia. 

A while ago, I wrote a blog post on the subject: Fold for sale. It's about balancing fold (how many traces go into the stack, basically, a big driver of signal:noise) with cost. My colleague Evan Bianco and I also did a series on modelling seismic acquisition. If you're into Python at all, there's some code to play with: 

Most if not all of the earth's rocks are radioactive (e.g. because of minerals containing isotopes in the uranium decay chain, such as potassium-40) and emit gamma radiation with wavelengths around $10^{-12}$ m. I'm not sure how much of this radiation would make it through the atmosphere. You said you're not interested in atmospheric phenomena, but I wonder what the relative contributions of subsurface and atmosphere (e.g. the auroral kilometric radiation), as well as manmade sources, would be to the total signature. The planets emit radio waves (ask a radio astronomer), but I suspect most of that energy is from their atmospheres, since Jupiter and Saturn are especially bright. This book by Vázquez, Pallé and Montañés Rodríguez (2010; Springer) looks like it might address some of this, e.g. in Chapter 4.
