As far as materials go.. I always prefer wool but any moisture wicking material should do... Good Luck. 

I actually don't have first hand experience with the Vuelta hub but based on this video Video of Removing a Vuelta Hub Cassette Body and your pictures I would predict that you need to use a cone wrench on the drive side and a 6mm hex inside the non-drive side axel to loosen the freehub body 

I think what you are looking for are a pair of "slicks" for your mountain bike. They come in a number of sizes for 26" wheels. Batman suggests looking for a set between 1.7 - 1.9" That is a good suggestion since you will be able to use the same tubes are are in your 1.95 mtb tires. If you are willing to get a new set of tubes with those tires, I would suggest looking for 26 x 1.25 - 1.5" slicks. It is a matter of preference, but I find them to be a bit quicker and responsive if you are willing to run the associated higher pressure. If you commute has lots of curb jumping, pot holes, or broke pavement 1.75s may be my choice... My experience is that 1.95 slicks really dont offer much over a fast rolling knobby tire. 

If you want a saddle that takes pressure off your sit bones (ischial tuberosities), this design is probably appropriate: 

Yes, you can, although you'll need a longer chain to go with it. The important thing here is the capacity of the rear mech you're using. However, since your bike already has 50/36 11-32 gearing, changing the chainset for a 52/39 actually reduces the amount of chain slack the rear mech has to deal with (52-39 < 50-36), so there shouldn't be any problem. Just remember to adjust the position of the front mech (move it up the seat tube) to accommodate the larger chainrings. 

Modern chains have inner and outer links. On a conventional chainring, all of the teeth are the same width, and therefore have to be narrow enough to fit into the chain's inner links. This means that there's enough space for the chain to move about a bit from side to side on the chainring, which can cause it to fall off. Historically this hasn't been much of a problem, since on geared bikes the front derailleur cage tends to stop it from falling off, and on single-speed bikes there's no chain slack or gear changing at the rear to cause chain-drop. However, when you remove the front derailleur, but keep the rear derailleur (as is becoming common with single-ring setups), dropping the chain becomes more of a problem. This can happen when changing gear on the cassette, or when a bump causes the chain to go slack momentarily. Narrow-wide chainrings have alternating narrow and wide teeth that fit into the inner and outer links respectively. This makes the chain more secure on the chainring and less likely to fall off. A narrow-wide ring is only necessary if you have a single chainring at the front and a rear derailleur. They won't work at all if you have more than one chainring at the front, since you won't be able to change gear. You don't need a special cassette, but you might benefit from using a clutched rear derailleur (particularly on a MTB), which prevents the chain from going slack on bumpy terrain. A well-established alternative to a narrow-wide ring is a chain guide, which behaves somewhat like a front derailleur in keeping the chain from falling off: 

Since you are new to cycling... I would say you made about as good of choice as you could have given the information. I know two people 5'7" and one likes 52cm frames and the other 48-50CM frames. The point is, the difference is subject to preference based on body type (e.g. short legs-long torso vs long legs-short torso). Once you get the bike there will be a number of adjustments (seat height, seat position, handlebar height) etc that can be made to dial things in just right. Finally, really try to understand the frame geometry of this bike so if and when you get your next bike you are vary familiar with the specs what you like what you wished was different etc... so you make the best possible choice in the future. 

The 0.5% - 0.75% answers when you should replace the chain but does not answer the max stretch before skipping. Sheldon Brown's site ( $URL$ ) indicates things get dramatically worse once the elongation reaches 1.0% because at that point it is every other link that is load bearing... so I would assume >= 1.0% is the answer with the variance being attributed to the condition of the cog. Checkout the link and you will learn more than you can imaging on chain-cog engagement. 

That looks like a Cerv√©lo RS (from some time around 2008) with an aftermarket Easton EC90 fork and DT Swiss wheelset fitted. You can find a review of the bike from when it was released here. 

There may be others brands that use a similar design, but I think ISM is the best known. The idea is that most of your weight is supported on the frontal prongs, rather than the flat area at the back. They have a gap in the middle to avoid putting pressure on your perineum. For this reason they're especially popular among time triallists and triathletes because they allow you to rotate your pelvis forward more comfortably. They feel quite different to conventional saddles, mostly because of the extra width at the front, and will probably take some getting used to. The image came from this review. 

The cycle computer will over-report your speed by a factor of , which amounts to about 2%. The speed calculated by the computer is , so if the circumference is 2% too big, then the speed will also be over-reported by 2%. Conversely, your actual speed will be about 2% smaller than what your cycle computer reports: a factor of . So if the computer says you're moving at 30 km/h, you'll actually be moving at about 29.3 km/h. The average speed will scale in exactly the same way as the instantaneous speed. In general, if your true wheel circumference is , the value you've put into the computer is , and the reported speed is , then the true speed will be . 

I agree with Mark W's answer above but as both a commuter and an off-road tourer I will give you another option/opinion as to what to look for in panniers if you want to have a setup that double duties for commuting and bikepacking. I have a pair of Specialized Ground Control Off-Road panniers circa 1993... they have a feature that is essential for off-road... the panniers attach to the rack via a compression straps. If looking to use the same setup for bike packing and commuting I would steer clear of pannier systems that use bungy cord attachments or engineered plastic attachments for quick connect-disconnect. The bungy cord systems tend to bounce off, the I would fear the quick connect systems may break or get compromised by dirt, mud, or grit. Downside to the pannier system: For off-road touring pannier systems do not distribute the weight as evenly as bike packing bag systems. Additionally, pannier systems are wider and can result in a clearance issues on narrow singletrack. For commuting the downside to bike packing setups is there is no large easy to disconnect storage. It would be nearly impossible to carry a computer (if that is your thing). For me, I would love to have both setups... however the downside to my off-road panniers for bike packing is less than the downside to bike packing gear for commuting. So if I was looking for one system to double duty for both applications it would be the correct set of panniers. I don't know of anyone making panniers like my Specialized off-road panniers so that option may be off out of reach for a new setup. 

It's difficult to say without seeing photos of the road layout. However, if the road itself continues round to the left, you should indicate right when you're leaving it. In general, you should think about the topology of the road, rather than its geometry. It doesn't matter that you're following a geometrically straight line; you're still leaving the road for a separate carriageway, and you need to signal this intention. The default assumption for someone crossing the road is that you'll continue along the carriageway you're already on. This said, of course, common sense should always prevail! Never do anything that feels dangerous (for you or for someone else). 

It turns out the tyre wasn't fine; here it is 2000km later. The tyre has split in two places on one side, and the bond between the bead and the sidewall looks pretty compromised all the way around. Thankfully it didn't blow out while I was on the bike! 

Sand the scratch down to remove the burrs. You can use super-fine wet & dry paper for this; something like 2000 grit should do the job without damaging the rest of the surface. Clean the scratch and the surrounding area thoroughly with isopropyl alcohol, removing any debris from the scratch itself. Fill the scratch with some high-quality epoxy. I've used J-B Weld in the past with some success. Some people have reported success with super glue or nail varnish, too. Wet a razor blade (or something similar) with water and use it to scrape off the excess. You want it to be as smooth and flat as possible. 

I recently (2015) purchased my first full-suspension mountain bike. As time goes by it is increasingly making creaking noises when I climb. Initially I thought it was the press fit bottom bracket but have now come to the opinion it is the frame linkages. Is it typical maintenance to remove the rear triangle and re-lubricate the pivot points on full-suspension mountain bikes? 

A couple years back I put a pair of 105 5800's on a 1986 Centurion Elite RS that had Diacompe brake levers. It worked great. I never even considered that the pull ratio would be an issue perhaps I should have? I have heard of pull ratio being an issue when trying to use cantilever brakes, linear pull (v-braves), or disk brakes with vintage road brake levers, but in my case... my 5800s worked with my 1986 diacompe levers just fine. 

Former Alsop Suspension Stem rider here... as much as I respect everyone's answers above I can say that Alsop suspension stem advocates would disagree with some of the assertions. Alsop's motto was "suspend the rider not the bike". So as far as having to decouple light-weight moving parts from heavy stable parts for suspension to work... That is exactly what an Alsop does, decouples the rider from the frequency vibration of the bike. Alsop stems, at least the later models, were spring loaded not polymer loaded. They traveled as a parallelogram giving about an inch to an inch and a half of travel. The parallelogram motion of the Alsop is what set them apart from competing suspension stems. Other suspension stems (Girvin Flex Stem) used a swing/pivot point which limited the overall travel and rotated the handlebars along an arc during compression. Limited travel and rotating controls led to the demise of the competition long before Alsop succumbed to the suspension fork. At the time I loved my Alsop Frankenstem... the problem and what eventually caused me to walk away from the product was they tended to wear out fast. Bushings constantly needed to be serviced. Additionally, they were susceptible to catastrophic failure. Over the course of 3 years I had 2 stems fail... horrible crashes and stitches were the result so I spent the better part of the next 20 years riding rigid bikes. 

Your mileage may vary here; if the filling comes off after riding, you might be looking at a new CSU if you want a complete fix. The fork will still work, of course, but a gap will allow dirt into the lower legs, which will effectively shorten the service interval on the fork. I've successfully repaired a nick in a Fox RP2 rear shock like this, and it's still going strong today. However, it didn't work so well on the stanchions of my TALAS 32, since the filling wouldn't stick for more than a couple of rides. 

This lacing pattern is actually explicitly recommended by Shimano and Magura for rear disc hubs. Under braking, the leading spokes will be in tension, while under drive the trailing spokes will be in tension. The tension acts to straighten out the spokes, pushing the spokes on the other side of the flange outward from the flange centre line. I don't know if anyone has measured this effect, but I imagine it's negligible for most purposes. Nonetheless, according to Roger Musson, old-fashioned disc brake designs used to have very tight clearances between the caliper and the NDS spokes, so you would want the leading NDS spokes to be on the outside at the final cross to avoid contact with the caliper under braking. This is irrelevant to your wheel because it doesn't have disc brakes. Conversely, there's an argument that the DS spokes should be laced the opposite way around to avoid contact with the mech cage under drive load when on the biggest sprocket. This seems even more tenuous to me, given how small drive forces are in comparison with braking forces. Either way, it's consistent with what's observed on your wheel. I'm not sure how much merit any of these arguments have ‚Äì would be nice to know if someone's measured it. But in any case, asymmetric lacing patterns have some favour among the big names in the industry, at least for disc brake set-ups. 

I spent some time on a century ride with a guy who had porteur bars on his cross check. They certainly did not seem to slow him down or make him uncomfortable. The Cross Check (full disclosure I do not have one) is the Swiss Army Knife of bikes. I say go for it... ride it for a season and if it is not your thing re-configure that ultimately configurable rig. 

For Ultimate durability I would go with downtube or bar-end shifters that can be switched to friction mode if things go horribly wrong... that being said after more than 30 years of cycling, I have never had a shifter fail. Chains have broken, cassette bodies have stopped racheting, cassette clusters have worn, etc. but I have never had a shifter give up the ghost. If you are interested.. there are a couple rear hub models that support tool-less cassette body removal and servicing. If I was on my way around the world I would be looking to get the right hubset before I looked to get the perfect shifter. 

Glasses fogging is constant problem in cold weather... the good news we are in the midst of a trend towards more cold weather riding and products are starting to come to market to reflect that trend.. google fat-biking. With that in mind I think there are a few different ways to attack the fogging problem
