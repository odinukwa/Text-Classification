While @quen_tin has give a fully adequate answer I would like to address the question, since I happen to be a friendly interlocutor with some very intelligent conspiracy theorists. First, you have "evidence" (E) of some sort, which reason then attempts to place within a causal or rational construct. This might entail predicting consequences or "effects" of (E) and/or retrodicting causes of (E). Both are problematic, but we have a tendency to think prediction is validating and retrodiction is obvious. In fact, any evidential event (E) can be "overdetermined." There may be many "efficient" or direct causes and an almost infinite number of events that might be causally necessary. It is like the "butterfly effect" in reverse. So, even in physical systems, "causality" is hardly as straightforward as we imagine. Now enters the idea of "conspiracy." This means human intentionality, causal efficacy, and social organization. For any event (E) there may be any number of people who might have wanted it... and given this overdetermination, one can readily map out the interested "reasons" if not the direct efficacious causes. One cannot "disprove" a conspiracy theory or any other source of possible causation. One can only rank the likelihood. Conspiracy theory tend to be "unphilosophical" because it assumes two incommensurable levels of human reason, a dualism. First, there are people capable of organizing with superior predictive and causal capacities... and, second,a majority of people who cannot, while still entering into the assumptions of the former. I would appeal to science as the contrary case. It is very difficult to imagine "secret science" since part of the efficacy of science is its "public" nature, the appeal to transparency and repeatable "experiments" theoretically open to "common sense." Conspiracy theory tends to conflate scientific efficacy with esoteric knowledge. However, conspiracy theory has a point. More and more of what might have been effects of "nature" of now products of human intentions. And such intentions are always related to "interests" and motives. Yet a "scientific" explanation cannot rest upon ascription of motives. That is theology. The causal connection between malevolent minority "interests" and global "effects" is usually far too remote and fanciful. 

I suggest you bracket the annoying [God] and [Attributes of God]. Stripped of this singular, proper name, the problem arises in all sorts of discussions. Why is there something rather than nothing? What came before the big bang? What is the nature of the set containing all sets that contain themselves? Is the Aristotelean unmoved mover another name for DNA? Etc. So the "philosophical" problem is quite ubiquitous.Why is it a problem? Spacetime is somehow very fundamental to cognition. Hard to subtract. Is it a priori? Kant places it in a peculiar position "prior" to the categories that make "a priori" judgments and thus "experience" even possible. Such transcendental appeals enraged physicists and the logical positivists. But they now find themselves back in a similar conundrum with a "big bang" that created space and time and mathematically attempting to to say how... what is the proper name of the creative singularity that came prior to space and time? But, as your quote suggests, we are talking about not only what "came before" or "caused" space and time, but what is even more fundamental? To the extent that it could act as the "measure" of space and time? Since space and time are entailed in the most fundamental "measurements" of physics, what can "measure" them? What could possibly stand prior to them? What universal constant, such as "light," could be used to measure space and time? Now, why return to an outmoded anthropomorphic proper name like [God]? Because whatever "created" spacetime must be "creative." Because we cannot deduce from any universe we know anything more "creative" than ourselves, who perform the deduction. Thus we wind up back at [God] or, if it makes you feel better, the anthropic principle. 

I've read only slim secondary works on Husserl some time ago, and recently started "The Crisis in the European Sciences." So far, the framework seems faithfully Kantian. Husserl, for example, describes geometry as a priori constructions "filling out" the spatio-temporal continuum, which is "the form of intuition." He refers to "transcendental" methodology. I suppose I will find out for myself eventually (haven't yet reached the book's treatment of Kant), but out of sheer laziness or anticipation, I'd like to know in what ways Husserl breaks with Kant, whom he followed by some six generations. Are there fundamental differences that can be briefly set out? Is Husserl generally deemed neo-Kantian? 

I don't really know, but my impression is that he is not read in philosophy departments at all, but is certainly read in departments of "critical theory," or whatever. I've never looked at the Parallax View, but much of his writing seems to me accessible, interesting, and amusing. I'm not big on Lacan, but I like some of his bits on Marx and Hegel. I believe many students and general readers like him because he relentlessly engages current issues and has an anticapitalist political dimension pitifully lacking in academic philosophy today. And he is, of course, massively well-read, eclectic, and prolific. I've never discerned the "grand thesis," if one exists, and I just take him as an essayist and provocateur, which I intend as a compliment, mostly. 

You seem to be confusing a very fundamental distinction. And mixing up symbols and whatever they are about. To "explain" something is not to "reproduced" or "expand" it. It is to "reduce" it in some functional way. A way general enough to be accessible to others. The classic example is a map. The map is useful only because it removes information. A map as large and detailed as the territory is not very useful. Indeed it leaves you right back where you started. Your idea that a "fundamental theory" should be more complex than what it explains is, I will say, original and entertaining. And it can often seem that philosophy strives to do just that. And yes, there is nothing that proves Occam's razor is "more true" than adding in all sorts of layers. Fairies, martians, spells, invisible rays, your own theory of gravity. You can add in all sorts of layers to "explanations." But strange as it sounds at first, "knowledge" is actually a reduction of possibilities. Possibilities are infinite. Knowledge reduces them. 

As Conifold points out, this is one of the problems in Hume's "associationism" addressed by Kant under the grand terminology of the "transcendental unity of apperception." Which he analyzes into sawdust. Though I have not dipped into Hume in a long time, it may be that he felt no need to specify further what "sort of thing" this principle of "association" is on the formal model of Newton's "gravity." At the purely nominal level we could call anything the "self," of course. But the term carries with it not only the idea of agency... but also of "simple" substance in the Leibnizian sense. I think it was this idea Hume was attacking, and the very idea of "simple" unitary, irreducible groundings. In general at this time, the idea of searching out some unitary substance was being replaced with "relations" between parts, with discursive, relational, or dialectical approaches. Rather than unitary "active agent" we have an "interaction" that unifies or mediates. In the Newtonian universe, for example, the "center" is now potentially everywhere and the "unity" is henceforth mathematical, with God for backup perhaps. Both Hume and Kant were struggling in some sense to generalize Newton. Kant seemed to think he could "get to the bottom of it" by breaking up Hume's broad associational force into innumerable "subatomic" parts all interacting systematically. As a critique it is compelling. But there is no "one" indispensable agent, center, or simple substance. There is instead a necessary coherence and a kind of "boundary" in the noumenal. Actually, Kant does preserve and insist upon the simple, continuous "soul," but I think it was important to him that neither God nor this soul assume an explanatory function within his epistemology. Not sure, I could be wrong about this. I'm not sure how one defines "active" at this level. Neither Hume nor Kant, already inspired by the physical sciences, will point to some "first cause." Today we have many other ways of dispensing with the unilateral idea of an "active" agent "responsible" for unifying percepts. We may speak of "responses" and "systems," "interactions" and "limits," or "regresses" or "attractors." On the information model we might say that the "most irreducible" thing we can talk about is an interactive, mediated (0,1) and never an active (1). Even so, it seems to me there is always going to be some sort of necessary coherence or "self by any other name," (personally, I just think of it metaphorically as the enclosing exteriority of a "membrane") so that cognitive theories expunging the simple, unitary "self" or "soul" are usually renaming a more complex unity, which is in keeping with the move away from a unitary, theocentric model begun by both Hume and Kant. 

I might only suggest that this might be better answered by revisiting Kant than by looking for "the latest." The good,old "thing in itself" is a very precise, well-developed idea of "radical alterity." It is not static. It feeds the "new." Since Kant was the first to bring aesthetics into philosophy, I would suggest that his idea of purposefulness without purpose is very close to the mechanically repeated "avant guard" that 20th century art became. Radical alterity is not, as far as I can see, an advance on the Kantian noumenal. Nor can a morality ever advance without the "radical alterity" of someone not "oneself," yet also treated as an end.
