Cycling is fine for exercise (if you’re not worried about building muscle), but your diet is far from being a long term solution. Given your statistics, you should be burning roughly 3200 calories a day. Even without any activity whatsoever (lying in bed all day), you should be burning 2000 calories just to function properly. To lose weight long term, you need to keep your caloric deficit reasonable. If you starve yourself like you are currently doing, you’ll only hold yourself back and wreck your metabolism in the process. To lose weight, you should be eating 2500-2700 calories a day with your current level of activity and size. To slow down muscle loss, you’ll also want to make sure that you’re getting enough protein in your diet, try to get 0.5-0.8 grams per pound of your body weight (117-188 grams). As you lose more and more weight, your body will need fewer and fewer calories. You’ll want to re-adjust your total to compensate for this. Google “TDEE Calculator” (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) and you’ll find several calculators that will calculate this number for you. 

~~A Workaround~~ Find someone who you know will want whatever you don’t use. Protein powder has a nice long shelf life, so it doesn’t hurt to keep extra in stock. Some people also like to have some variety to break up the norm. Regardless, talk with this person and agree on a price that they will buy the powder off of you. Buy a few flavors and see which ones you like. Sell the ones you don’t. ... alternatively, just find a friend (or two, or three) Who work out and ask if you can try some of what they have. 

Eating less calories than your TDEE requires will result in weight loss. Eating more calories than your TDEE requires will result in weight gain. Only exercise will produce additional muscle mass. So while a diet plan can help you lose weight, only exercise will get you “in shape”. When you lose weight, you lose both muscle and fat, you can work around the muscle loss by doing a few things; exercise, eating enough protein, and losing weight slowly 0.5-1 lb per/week (as opposed to quickly 2+ lbs per week). The problem with avoiding exercise and losing weight quickly is that you begin to develop the classic “skinny fat” body type. You also slow your metabolism more by not exercising and losing muscle. Bottom line, will it work? Probably. However, it will also require that you exercise for best results. There aren’t any big secrets in the world of nutrition, and things are pretty straightforward generally. This plan along with countless others has the potential to help people, but it depends on the people themselves to make it work. 

You can ask your doctor, but if the doctor does not know about nutrition, he might just continue to give you medications and that is it. You can also check with various doctors the information that are used by other people with the same issue reported by doctors like in this link: $URL$ $URL$ There are tons of medical papers released on this available on the net. Also remember that you are less likely to need glucose with aerobic training that with anaerobic training. 

there are a few points to be answered on your comments above. I will ty to answer one by one over a period of time. The first point is about the calories intake and % of what you eat. First of all I should ask how old you are and how much you weight, however, given the calories you tell me you consume, I can tell you that they are way too much, you do not need so many calories, especially if a lot of them comes from proteins and carbs. To build muscles, you do not need a lot of protein, that is old school, the most recent research shows that 1g per pound of body weight would be enough. At the moment you are telling me that you are consuming 3000 calories of which 40% protein which equal 1200 calories, which divided by 4, the calories per grams of protein, you are eating 300 grams of protein. When you eat too much protein, the body uses some, and then some will be converted into glucose and the insulin will convert the rest into fat. It is an expensive way to get glucose! That amount of protein will also create other demands on the digestive system, insulin resistance, amount of vitamins and enzimes to absorb them, etc.., too long to discuss now. That it is about the proteins. 

I agree with the statement made: The "core" is so misunderstood on this site (and in general). I'd love to figure out how to explain the "core" at a less technical and understandable level. – Mike-DHSc Can I just said that the Core IS your natural belt, the stronger it is, the BETTER the belt, the stronger the support. However, can I add, that when I was 23 years old and competing at the London championship, I had to prepare to clean and jerk 150kg, to do that I went on deadlifting up to 230kg for 1 rep, at that level, I needed a belt to keep the core in place "just in case", as the core can only get strong up to a point, as it cannot get trained the same as the deltoid etc.... So for maximum weight of 4 sets of 1 rep each, if you feel that the core it is not there yet, maybe you can use the belt, otherwise you would have to wait longer before you get to the point to do it without. I hope I have explained myself clearly enough. 

First of all, it depends on how close you are to your maximum muscle potential. By that, I am referring to the maximum amount of muscle that you could potentially (naturally) carry on your frame according to your individual genetics. Refer to FFMI to roughly determine this. The closer you are to that, the less likely that simultaneous fat loss/muscle gain will be possible. $URL$ Second, if you stay in a positive nitrogen balance (usually by eating enough protein) and you eat enough calories to maintain your weight (total weight), then it is possible, but expect slower results on both fronts. If you are young and you still have plenty of muscle potential left, then you have quite a bit more wiggle room than older folks who are closer to their maximum potential, but it is very much possible. Third, is it desirable? You could eat in a slight surplus (gaining 0-0.5 lbs a week) and have an excellent lean bulk if your goal is to put on muscle. You’ll gain more muscle mass this way, but how much more? There is no scientific answer for that. It could very well be marginal at best. So while you would put on “more” muscle almost definitely, the actual percentage might be underwhelming in the face of looking at having to lose weight down the line. On the other hand, it might be a significant number. There are too many variables at play. Regardless ANY kind of bulk will definitely grant faster muscle building, the exact amount just isn’t clear. Fourth, decide what is important to you and what isn’t. Decide on the path based on that. Both paths will take a lot of time. One path gets to higher muscle mass quicker, but at the cost of additional fat. The other path comes at the cost of being more strict with yourself (finding that ideal personal balance). Whatever you choose, I wish you luck! Edit - One thing I didn’t mention that is also important to this whole thing is your body fat percentage. If your BF% is low (12 or under) you’ll probably want to simply focus on a lean bulk rather than weight maintenance through fat loss and muscle gain. From what I understand of your question, you’re probably somewhere around here. I already explained the lean bulk in the third paragraph, so there’s no need to repeat that but, but let’s talk about how it correlates to body fat. If you don’t have a lot of body fat to lose, then your (overall) weight will almost need to increase when you put on additional muscle due to the additional weight of the muscle itself. This is a good thing, but keep in mind that not everything you gain will necessarily be muscle. Typically, a man will be able to add 1-2 pounds of muscle to his frame per month under good-ideal conditions. Therefore, if you gain more than that, it’s easy to gauge what may be muscle and what may be fat. 

I am 51 years old and I am training 4 days a week now, and have lost weight and gained muscle by following what I explain below. In my experience as a trainer in London, I started 27 years ago to train people for competition and myself,to lose weight with weight training and no cardio when everyone was telling me the opposite. So as far as exercise go, you can only do weight and no cardio, and you will lose weight, to do this you have to accompany this with a way of eating, once you have achieved your goal you can decide how to continue. First, I would stop eating 4 -5 times a day, because every time you eat it trigger insulin release, and if there is insulin in your blood you are not losing weight, especially if it is been triggered by carbohydrate and simple sugars. To do this you need to switch to eat 2 or 3 times a day maximum, with the majority of your calories intake coming from good fats sources,( Olive oil, coconut oil, butter, avocado, salmon Etc..) vegetables and salads and proteins, 75% fats, 20% proteins and 5% carbs which you will derive from the vegetables. If you feel you need some more energy for the training, then you just make sure you eat some carbs about 1 hour before training in the form of low Glycemic index fruit, but ONLY then, as fructose once stored does not get used as an energy source. Then your body only uses carbs during training, the rest of the time is forced to use stored fats, which do not spike insulin. 

A very simple a short answer to your final question above is, IF speeds up the process of losing weight by spiking the release of growth hormone. If to IF you add a ketogenic diet then you would maximize the fat loss by reducing the insulin presence. 

Maybe this will help more...with references at the end. To do with weights Many bodybuilders follow training routines that have them exhaustively train each muscle group only one time per week. While this may provide decent results over time, it is actually a rather inefficient way to train. A study in the “Canadian Journal of Applied Physiology” found that muscle protein synthesis dramatically increases 65% above baseline 24 hours after a heavy bout of resistance training, and then drastically declines back to baseline at about the 48-hour mark post-workout. Therefore, a much more prudent way to train would be to hit each muscle group 2-3 times per week and split the volume across each session. Think of each training session as an opportunity to induce growth; would you only want to grow your chest 52 times per year or, say, 104-156 times per year? Still not sure how to answer this? Well a second study in the “Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research” found that subjects who trained only one day per week had only 62% of the strength gains compared to subjects who split their training over 3 days per week (volume was matched between the two groups). To do with cardio Cardio isn’t essential for fat loss, but it may help. Science tells us that we lose weight when we burn more calories than we consume, so if performing cardio helps with that equation, then sure, it’s advisable. But consider this – lifting weights also elevates the heart rate and burns calories. In fact, the more muscle mass you have, the more calories you burn. So there could be an argument for the fact that burning calories through lifting weights is arguably more beneficial in the long term, but we won’t get into that here. To do with Eating The theory that your body would find it easier to handle and digest multiple smaller meals per day in comparison to larger, more infrequent feedings makes sense to a certain degree, right? It’s reasonably similar to the notion that dumping an enormous pile of wood onto a fire might not be as advantageous as gradually adding in one log at a time – but your metabolism isn’t a fire. Every time you eat, you burn calories digesting the meal you’ve just consumed. This is referred to as the thermic effect of food (TEF). Whilst different macronutrients contain a different increase in TEF, whether you look at the percentage increase from a meal perspective or a day’s worth of eating, that percentage is going to remain the same. Different macronutrients have a slightly different thermic effect, but at the end of the day, 10 x 250 calorie meals is ultimately going to burn the same amount of calories through digestion as 1 x 2500 calorie meal, provided the macronutrient breakdown is the same of course. So quit with the stop-watch – there’s no need to time your meals to the minute just to lose fat, so long as you aren’t consuming too many total calories. To do with cutting or toning There seems to be a variety of misconceptions attached to weight training; a popular one in particular is the idea that lifting lighter loads for more reps (say 15+) will “tone” muscles better than using heavy loads for fewer reps (6 or less). Aside from the fact that “toning” is a nonsensical term when it comes to muscle morphology, there is little basis to the presumption that using light weights and doing many repetitions is superior for muscle hypertrophy over using a weight that you may only be able to complete 5 reps with per set. At the end of the day muscle hypertrophy is muscle hypertrophy; muscles grow or atrophy, which is what changes their shape. Using a mix of several rep ranges with both higher and lower loads will ultimately be best for building and maintaining muscle. Let your diet do its thing for fat loss and keep training much like you would when trying to gain muscle—what builds muscle best retains it best. Moreover, you cannot “spot-reduce” certain body areas no matter how much you target/stimulate them. If you want an etched six-pack of abdominals, skip the marathon sets of sit-ups; work instead on providing progressive overload to the abdominals and losing sufficient body-fat. The best way to ensure you’re building or maintaining muscle is having a progression scheme in place. When you go into the gym one of your main priorities should be trying to progress from your previous workout. Keep in mind that progression doesn’t always have to mean adding weight to the bar, but can come in the form of adding more volume, increasing frequency, adding various intensity techniques, etc. Just focus on progressing/improving in some capacity each week 

Yes, but again, so could any type of training. The reason being is that the muscles will get bigger and stronger from training. 

The only way to determine progress is by having a point of reference. Doing two similar exercises, one at an earlier point in time and the other later doesn’t provide a good point of reference. However, doing the same exercise is a good point of reference. While it might not seem like a big difference, “same” and “similar” can give very different results when using them as points of reference. Therefore, the best way to determine progress is by repeating your point of reference. 

You’ll want something beeping for you while this is happening so you don’t have to stare at your phone and for that I would suggest a free app called “IntervalTimer”. Of course, there are many other ways to have something to let you know when to switch between intervals, but that’s just my suggestion. ... On the nutrition side of things, make sure you get enough protein (1.5-2x your kg weight throughout the day) and calcium to help give your muscles and bones what they need. You could also try supplementing with creatine as it helps to further strengthen the muscles and provide energy. 

Will it build muscle? Maybe very very slightly, but certainly not anything notable. Muscle is built by breaking down muscle fibers by presenting a sufficient challenge and then allowing them the time and fuel to recover. Can jumping rope do this? It’s certainly possible, but compared to something like lifting weights you’re only getting a small fraction of the muscle building results (and even that takes a lot of time to be noticed). Why is jumping rope so inefficient for building muscle? One word; failure. Working your muscles to or close to failure ensures that you are breaking them down enough to produce a good hypertrophic response from the body. With jumping rope, sure you may break down some muscle fibers and you certainly may get stronger, but it’s simply not going to be anything notable. Which isn’t to say that jumping rope is worthless, that isn’t the case at all. Jumping rope is a great conditioning exercise that engages many body parts and builds cardiovascular endurance. However, it is suboptimal for building muscle. If you want to build muscle, you can still enjoy it, but you’ll want to include other things into your routine.
