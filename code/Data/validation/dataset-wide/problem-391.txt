Besides geomagnetic storms, obviously. This has to be man-made. At first I considered a HEMP, but who would've guessed nuclear weapons had so many failsafes to prevent premature detonations? So then the question is "how could I cause an accidental global blackout without using nukes or The Power of the Sun"? Alternatively, "how could I make enough nukes detonate prematurely without any elaborate sabotage"? P.S. The "accidental" part is really important. It has to be an unexpected consequence of something, or at least appear to be one on the surface. 

Okay, so I have a species of tree that's absolutely enormous, 1-5km tall when fully matured. Its immense size is supported by a large base, bark that incorporates a 2-d carbon lattice for strength (similar to graphene, carbyne and carbon nanotubes), and a fully functioning circulatory system to distribute nutrients to the top of the tree, all designed to overcome the limitations placed on its growth by gravity. These trees are obviously the kaiju of the plant world, and just like the Earth's biome could only feasibly support a handful of such giant creatures, I'd imagine only so many of these trees could exist on a given planet or landmass, and probably not enough to sustain a genetically diverse population. That got me to thinking. How does this plant species reproduce? Now, bear with me. I realize I'm no science or biology major and that I totally stole this idea from Starship Troopers, but could this tree's life cycle incorporate biological "eruptions" designed to fling seeds/spores as far as possible to cover a wider area? I imagine it'd work something like this. After reaching adulthood, the tree begins to continuously build up pressure in its main chamber, or perhaps it begins converting some of its nutrients into a flammable explosive stored inside the trunk. It then periodically "erupts" in a series of small (relatively speaking) ejections that relieve pressure and fling its seeds with enough force to scatter them across the surface of the planet to seed areas hundreds or even thousands of miles away. After a certain number of these small eruptions, the planet is covered in the main tree's smaller, monozygotic offspring, and the tree begins nearing the end of its reproductive cycle. It then allows the pressure or the concentration of explosive fluid to build without erupting until it bursts in the largest eruption of its life, which kills the tree but sends a large seed hurtling not just into the atmosphere to cover the planet, but into space to seed the next planet it lands on. Is this plausible? Is this mechanism viable and could such a large organism that flings its seeds/spores into space at escape velocity possibly exist? 

So in my setting, humanity has developed reliable sub-light travel using antimatter propulsion by the year 2247, and has slowly begun exploring and colonizing immediate interstellar space within a radius of about sixty light years. They have advanced biotech such as full prosthetic cyborg bodies and medical nanotechnology, and they have even created slightly superhuman artificial intelligences that, while not the dreaded apocalyptic superbrains predicted in our time, are smart enough to be of strategic value despite the hardware required to house them taking up the same space as a small warehouse. Are all these technological advancements feasible within the next 200 years? Does it strain believability at all to suggest that in 200 years we'll have a functioning, thriving interstellar economy based on deep-space mining and colonization? 

$URL$ $URL$ With a hundred years of development, could this technology realistically be extrapolated into thermal suppression units efficient enough to give the illusion of stealth in space (i.e. minimal hull black body radiation above the cosmic background)? Or is it still physically impossible to avoid detection in the great black? 

So I've got a bunch of freeze-dried colonists traveling in torpor to a solar system 55 light years away at 92% c. From an outsider's perspective it takes them sixty years to get there, but how long would it feel like for the people onboard the ship? How long would they be in suspended animation, and how many countermeasures would need to be put in place to regenerate lost muscle and generally keep them from looking and feeling sixty years older once they reach their destination? I'm not sure of the actual numbers, so I thought I'd come looking for help here :) 

Basically, why are aliens always jerks that want to roflstomp us with a military doctrine borrowed straight from the colonial era as written by Hitler and co-authored by Darth Vader? What possible reason could there be for a more advanced species to want to destroy us? Are they simply dogmatic and xenophobic? Do they see other races as an unnecessary drain on the universe's limited resources? Are they afraid that we'll become a possible competitor race if they don't destroy us now? If so, how did they get to be so advanced with such a hostile approach to cooperation with other sentient life? Why would we be a drain on resources when, at a certain point in every species' technological development, scarcity should climb asymptotically close to zero? If they're so much more advanced than us already, why would they even perceive us as a threat? In a nutshell, my question is, "what motivation could there be for an alien species to be intentionally malevolent towards us rather than simply destroying us as an unintentional side effect of doing whatever it is they do?" 

Both in terms of power and functionality. With what we currently know about materials science, how much power in joules or watts could a humanoid frame with densely packed artificial muscle fibers like a gorilla or a chimp's exert? How much of the human body sans brain could theoretically be replaced with artificial muscles and organs? 

So I had an idea earlier today and was wondering. Most sources you consult about the supposed "vacuum metastability event" say that the bubble would begin expanding at NEARLY the speed of light, not exactly the speed of light. How much slower would it really be? Would it give us enough time to see it coming or would it still happen so fast we'd be annihilated instantly? For example, if it was slowed to 99%, 98%, 97% etc., would we be able to see the stars going out in the night sky like so many popular sci fi flicks? How long could we ever have to conceivably prepare for a vacuum metastability event before it arrives? Days? Months? Years? If anyone knows anything about this, it'd be really helpful. 

I wanna have a scene where the protagonists see the gray goo excreting human skeletons because they can't use the calcium in them for anything. But is this true? Would a self-replicating machine regard any chemical elements as truly "useless" to its goals, or would it endeavor to disassemble atoms and molecules that aren't immediately useful into ones that are? My guess is that it's not worth the extra energy to try and process atoms of one element into another until you've truly run out of other sources of that element you can easily harvest, but I'd like your opinions, as well as input from anyone who knows what useful purposes calcium might serve to such a machine. 

Let's assume the reactor takes up about 4 vertical kilometers and has the same radius as the ship (4km). This gives you a volume of about 2.01e11 m^3, which given about 3-5% of the reactor's estimated mass means your available reaction mass (presumably mostly hydrogen) at any given time would be a few gigatons. This is feasible if you harvest asteroids and comets in interstellar space and could probably last you decades, if not centuries without having to make stops to harvest more fuel (if I'm wrong, please, PLEASE correct me on this). The ship itself weighs around 5.5e18 kg, and I'd like it to be able to pull 1g for an extended period of time (long enough to reach moderate fractions of light speed, up to .1c). Does my ship's reactor need to be bigger? How much wattage could you get out of a generator this size with this much reaction mass? How long would it last? I really don't know how fusion power compares to fission and fossil fuels in terms of efficiency and energy production, so I could really use some help. 

A large railgun mounted on the spine of a mega-scale starship (20-32km) or an antimatter-powered missile launched outside the ship? For clarification's sake, when I say "safer" I'm referring to "safer for the ship firing the weapon" rather than anything else. I figure the railgun has more combat advantages, as the projectile spends less time in open space accelerating compared to a missile, which makes it less vulnerable to premature detection and destruction by laser-intercept weapons. Additionally, its heat signature is masked by the larger heat signature of the ship, giving the enemy less forewarning that the weapon is being fired as opposed to a missile, whose engines would appear as their own distinct heat signatures apart from the ship. On the flip side however, a missile would not impart any of its destructive energy on the ship, which is a problem a railgun would certainly have. That being said, storing missiles that are fueled by antimatter is also pretty far from safe (although a ship this size would certainly need it as fuel anyway). So which is safer for the ship firing them while still being effective in combat, missiles or railguns? 

Let's say you have a cyborg who's replaced their whole body, everything but the brain, with machinery. Next, you put them on a spaceship pulling dozens or even hundreds of gs. How are they going to survive? What's the best way to protect a disembodied brain from arbitrarily high g-forces? This question pertains specifically to space travel, however it might also be useful in answering the question of whether or not a cyborg is physically capable of dodging a bullet (the eternal question that's stumped sci-fi writers for ages lol). 

And how much fuel would you need to carry? I'm trying to determine what kind of engine you'd need to accelerate a good-size spacecraft (thousands to millions of tons) at a constant 1g in a race across the solar system, and what kind of weight-to-fuel ratio you'd end up with (as well as what ratio would be ideal). Obviously fusion rockets are currently the most plausible and efficient method of propulsion we have in "harder" science fiction (aside from nuclear propulsion and lasers), so I need to know what kind of reactor you'd need to be packing to push a racing vessel equipped with crew, shielding and weapons down the cosmic cul-de-sac, so to speak. I'd really appreciate it if anyone could tell me how to solve for this problem, because I do need to apply it to other constant rates of thrust (most of the racers are altered transhumans who can handle abnormal g-loads and one aptly-named "Machinehead" has cut himself down to a cybernetically-augmented head in a jar of suspension fluid in order to push the smallest possible craft at a constant 43gs). 

A lot of people are probably familiar with this sort of handwavium in fiction when it's asked where a shapeshifter's extra mass comes from. Most choose to ignore that question. In works that pretend to be slightly more credible, they simply state that no extra mass is being created at all and that the shapeshifter is in fact merely grossly obese. Or at least they would be, were they not using their power to simply make themselves look like a 200lb man who actually weighs 500lbs. Presumably this is done by eliminating a lot of the empty space either in the human body or between the molecules themselves. But this begs the question. How much mass can you actually handwave away like this before it becomes really obvious that this 150lb woman is actually a 700lb shapeshifter in disguise? Density is still a thing, and at some point the surface area to density ratio of all this compacted flesh and biomass is going to make the shapeshifter's legs sink into the very ground they walk on, no matter how careful they are to conceal their true weight. When would this happen? What's the realistic limit to how much mass a shapeshifter could conceal in a humanoid frame before the extra weight becomes obvious? I'm assuming it would have to be greater than 500lbs but I'm not sure.
