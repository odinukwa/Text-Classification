There are a lot of games out there ("team building" games, introductory ones, icebreakers etc.). This is just the first result of a google search. All games can be adapted to the size and age of the group, but using such games needs preparation in advance. Some people find such games a nuisance, others tend to enjoy them a lot - it really varies. A lot of (youth) organizations have game databases with all kind of searching parameters (size, age, purpose, environment etc.), for example there is this one for small children. I know others, but not in English, so... :( Besides the aforementioned common chores and "doing something hard" together I would mention introducing some sort of ritual. It can be as short as a few minutes, but it should include everyone in the team. Some examples: 

Disclaimer: I am from Romania, my answer is a bit tailored to this corner of the world. This issue is very common in Central/Eastern European countries and in the Balkans: not only the household dogs in villages, but stray ones (even in cities), and especially the shepherd dogs. Might be a bit repeating the other answers, but I really must point this out, as it has been the source of many accidents, attacks and (yet unsolved) disputes on law inforcements. Shepherd dogs are bread to be aggressive: whether assertive barking when turning the hundreds of sheep, giving alarm of an intruder or scaring away bears. The herds can be met literally anywhere (I met them near my hometown, or also at 2200 m altitude in the mountains), and if you approach them they most probably become aggressive. Methods of staying safe: 

The mountain you're planning to hike is similar in size to the mountains I climb in the Canadian Rockies. I grew up climbing mountains, but I've never been one for training, especially running. If I was you I'd just go climb the mountain. When I was in University I led a group of guys on a multi-day backpacking trip in the mountains near where I grew up, I was nervous because I knew a couple of them were runners and spent a lot of time jogging each day; I doubted my fitness in comparison. On the hike it became apparent that I was the strongest hiker carrying a big bag, the reason being that out of everyone in the group, I had spent my youth carrying big bags on long hikes. The others were athletic, but had trained their bodies to perform during different activities. That being said, on another occasion when I took a group of boys out backpacking there was one 17 year old boy who had never carried a bag in his life, but was heavily involved in team sports. He stormed the trail like nothing could slow him down leaving everyone else in his dust, and did it without breaking a sweat. To add insult to injury he did it wearing an old pair of gym sneakers. If you're reasonably fit, and have a good pair of footwear, then I'd say you're adequately prepared to take that hike on. The only thing you'll need to learn is how to pace yourself. If you don't know how to pace yourself, you'll figure out your pace after about an hour of hard hiking when you're exhausted. What would serve you better than physical training, is practical knowledge. Learn some basic mountain safety and first aid. Those skills will serve you better in the mountains than how many leg days you do in a week. 

If it is a more polluted area, try the method suggested by WedaPashi (cleanup activity with friends), or take a look at Let's Do It - a worldwide trash-collecting/volunteering action; find your country and contact the local organization. This also puts the issue in an other light (and on the world map), and it might get bigger media attention too, spread the awareness etc. 

I would say it is a walnut tree. The bole is flat, and at first sight it seems that someone cut the lower branches of it (at some point when the tree was younger). The leaves also look like the ones of walnut. If it has no fruits on the branches then it might be a bad year, or some hail destroyed the harvest, or the tree might have some illness (see points on the lower leaves). Disclaimer: I am not a botanist, we just have a lot of walnut trees in our orchard. 

I often use Bikemap.net, not only for bike trails, but also for hikes: has really good maps and also nice route planning functions; you can save your maps to be available offline, and then track them on your smartphone. Or you can print the detailed maps, frame by frame. The Bikemap page took me to Wandermap.net which also seems to be useful, but I somehow got used to the first one. Not sure if these cover what you mean by "walking on sideways", but if uncertain about pavements on a route, you may always double check satellite recordings on google maps too. 

You should get a lapstick. I don't imagine that you're going to be able to find anything more convenient or compact than this thing is. 

You're talking more about the culture of skiing when you start talking about telemarking than you are about superior technology. Telemarks were the backcountry ski of choice for many years, but AT skiing is quickly overtaking it on the Alpine skiing scene, and NNN and SNS have been dominating the X-country scene for years already because they are lighter, easier to use, don't ball up with snow and ice, and are cheaper, leaving Telemark as a kind of niche sport with a strong cult following. But even telemark is evolving more into AT, you'll notice that the telemark boots on the far right in the picture below are also dynafit compatible, so you could use those boots with both telemark or AT bindings. 

The straps are supposed to be short, it helps give you more power on your pole stroke, and keep better control of you poles. When you properly fit your straps, you're supposed to adjust them short enough be able to draw your poles behind you and lift them off the ground with your hands open. This gives your hands an opportunity to relax in the latter part of your pole stroke, and when bringing your poles back to your front. You don't want to be able to drop your poles out of your grip, but you want to be able to let your grip loose without fumbling to get it back. Your pole straps are made for fast powerful pole strokes on long poles. you only wear light gloves with that style of strap because when you're racing you stay warm from staying active, you don't wear thick clothes or gloves because you'll overheat and sweat like crazy. If your hands are getting cold, then you're probably not staying active enough. You may want to look at more of a recreational pole strap if you want to slow down and ski more leisurely. 

When I hike alone, I tend to stop very often, just to take photos or pick some herbs. Hiking with other people motivates me to go on. Of course, the slowest person dictates the pace of the group, and that is often me. What proved to be a good practice when I am with a bigger group is to split in two: those who want to go faster are not bored because of the slow ones, and the slow people don't get tired too fast because of the unsuitable pace. We agree on a mid-point where the fast guys wait for the slower ones (have lunch there or something), and then we meet at the day's destination. The tendency I noticed is that the slow group is usually delayed with 20-30 minutes, but of course this can vary on people and terrain. 

These can be done with what nature provides, but might not be so much up to the Leave No Trace policy. 

Once it happened that we were camping in the middle of a pine tree forest: weather was clear, no wind... After waking up we found a 20 meter long pine tree fallen down right between two tents. We had sheer luck for the tree falling in the "right" angle + being slowed down by the other trees around it. 

I've hauled pretty much everything you can imagine on the tops of my vehicles through hurricane force winds. Southern Alberta is one of two places on Earth where Chinook winds regularly occur. Winds in excess of 100km/h are a common thing here, I used to fight constantly with my 17' Canoe before I finally installed a roof rack. I used to use foam canoe blocks and 4 ratcheting cargo straps to clamp the bow and stern down so hard onto the top of my truck that the roof would collapse, the hull would flex, and it still wouldn't be enough to keep it down, but I've never cracked a windshield before. I actually happen to be an independant Yakima rack dealer now. While I very much doubt that the cause of your crack was the rack system, I can't speak for the integrity of your station wagon. The bow and stern lines aren't meant to be cranked down either way, just firmly and evenly snug so that they can help reduce whatever wiggle your kayak may have. What @Pepi says is right about putting a few twists in your strap to reduce vibration, you'll notice every trucker you see on the highway does the same thing. 

If any of the children/youngsters has an alternative we are glad to hear it and ready to implement it within our possibilities and money limits. When camping in the same place in nature for more days we still met some constraints: no opportunity for storing raw meat or eggs for a longer time; if we wanted to cook some meat, someone had to go to the village in the morning and get it. We learned to deal with this by using canned food + spicy, saucy recipes which take the attention away from the can's taste. Also, we introduced days with more "fun" food for the children, such as pancakes or something they like: this is always a pleasant surprise for them. These remain as highlights, so they never mention that one time when they had pea mash (something less popular). When they really choose not to eat, then we give them one alternative: bread with some spread - not chocolate or marmalade, but something average. At the end of the camp we make a feedback session, and then usually we hear things like "next time don't cook this or that". If there is a general argument against a food, we will take it off the list. Same worked out on biking trips (2 week long with 35 people). When we had resting days we cooked more interesting foods, which was fun and rewarding too. 

It seemed pretty SRENE to me, the only flaw was the potential for extension, but using a bulky nylon sling seemed to make extension less of an issue, when I unclipped one of my biners to test how it would extend, it simply didn't. The amount of friction generated from the nylon made it very difficult to pull through, I actually turned one of the hangers a bit while trying. My question is, is this an appropriate method of extending an anchor? What would be a better method of extending an anchor such as this one? The Crag: 

Sicherungsmann Before they invented the first climbing aids, human anchors were all alpinists had for protection. 

The difference is in the footwork, you back-step (what I always refer to as dropping your knee) while face climbing, but you can do it while you are laying back. A classic layback is like when you're climbing a crack while smearing your feet against the wall: 

@Sherwood Botsford shared a very specific survival floating technique in the comments called drownproofing. It's very similar to a deadman float except you are vertical and under the surface of the water, only using very gentle motions to just bring your mouth to the surface every 10-12 seconds for a new breathe of air.
