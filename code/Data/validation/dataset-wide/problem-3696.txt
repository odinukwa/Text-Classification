The reverse plank bridge to butterfly stretch is good for correcting rounded shoulders and opening up the groin. Taken from this video. Static hip flexor stretch to stretch shortened hip flexors. Standing pike stretch to stretch shortened hamstrings. Dead hangs for spinal decompression. Upper trapezius stretch if you think your shoulders are in an elevated position (can happen if your keyboard is too high). 

Unlikely. If you sleep in that position, the only thing that might happen to some extent is that your subscapularis might stretch out a tiny bit due to the weight of your forearm. This does not strengthen your back musculature which is really the important part. 

This machine is moving the glute through a bigger range of motion than a leg press machine, where the glute does not maximally contract (maximum hip angle is only about 90 degrees, which is at the top of the motion). 

High rep hypertrophy work will not only retain muscle, but will also condition your musculature to get ready for heavy lifting after the break. Lifting in only low rep ranges is suboptimal, especially since you are a beginner. Every good strength training program has a hypertrophy phase in the beginning. In fact, I believe this is an excellent opportunity to do improve lagging areas, stuff that people are usually lazy about - like mobility, posture, cardiovascular efficiency. This will complement your ability to move heavy weight and stay injury-free. You can also try stuff that challenges you in new ways - unilateral exercises, bodyweight exercises, calisthenic movements, squat/bench/deadlift variations. Some links: 

Not really, it is probably the opposite actually. I'm guessing you might have "forward head posture" or "text neck" which means you have lost the normal lordosis present in the cervical spine (it is too straight), causing the upper trap to be in a stretched position and get weak. You should do exercises like chin tucks, which you can easily find online. 

In my opinion, stretching is not enough and should be accompanied by strengthening of the muscles that get long and weak while staying in bad posture for long periods of time. Doing a ton of rowing, hip extension, abdominal, chin tuck exercises is a good starting point. For only a minimal set of stretches, my choice would be: 

The reason is internally rotated shoulders! Tight internal rotator muscles are preventing your shoulder from externally rotating and letting the wrist touch the bed. 

I am a hobby lifter having an excessive lumbar lordosis curve. A few weeks back I noticed it, and have been trying to fix it by the traditional approach of correcting lower cross syndrome. I made a temporary routine in which I'm greatly limiting exercises that train the spinal erectors, and doing a ton of volume in anti-extension ab exercises and glute exercises that do not load the spine too much, twice a week. I am also doing hip flexor and erector spinae stretches (kneeling lunge and child pose) and trying to not sit so much. I have not seen much change in the past few weeks, so I think I'm missing something. I noticed that some people talk about diaphragmatic breathing having an effect on APT, is that correct? I am also considering taking a deep tissue massage in the lower back area to ease tightness, will that help? Exercises I'm doing: 

I'm almost 19 years of age and I am regularly doing gym since 3 months. With the height of 5'10 and weight of merely 115 pounds, I initially joined the gym with the intention of becoming a little 'bulky' and put on some muscles. I was very much a computer bug few months ago and didn't pay due attention to my own body or other's body as a standard of benchmark, but now that I do, I see in trains or other public places that most people already have bulky biceps and chest without maybe even visiting the gym once, then there are these bulky sorts of guys that come to the gym and the weight they lift or press, is laughable looking at their muscle mass. I mean it's obviously more weight than me, but not by a very large margin, just 2-5KGs more than what I do, so I believe its very attainable in near future. Some time ago I came across the phrase hypertrophy vs strength training (for me strength training included all types of lifting earlier). Currently, my gym trainer has prepared a workout routine for me that is something like : Everyday : Chinups : 15x5 ; Push-ups : 10x5 at start ; Wrist curls 20x5 and shoulder press 15x5 (with a weight lighter than I usually use for shoulder press) Monday: Chest 4x10 (consists of 4-5 exercises for chest) ; Triceps : 3x10 (again, 4-5 usual exercises for triceps) Tuesday : Back : 3x10 ; Biceps : 3x10 Wednesday : Shoulders : 3x10 ; Legs : 3x10 Repeat on tuesday, friday and satudray There are some exceptions like for calf raise the reps are 20-25. So from what I see, he wants me to train for hypertrophy? Again, I don't want to do all this hard-work and become simply fluffed, I want to genuinely get stronger, to lift more weights and strength that accompanies me everyday, not just the looks of it. I have done some research of what hypertrophy is but I still remain largely a noob, so if I train for strength, lets say adding more weight than I currently do for 4-6 reps, that will make me neurologically stronger and also help with atleast some muscle gains? Or perhaps I should go for both of them? How do you suggest I incorporate those changes so that I train for strength as well as size? Also, I understand what is progressive overload, but under what method is it applied? Strength or Hypertrophy? and how do you properly incorporate it? Eg- I do military overhead press with let's say 5 KG on both sides, now for progressive overload to occur, should I increase subsequent reps from 6 to 8 to 10 in next sets or should I increase weight from 5 to 7.5 to 10 KG? and the reps go down from like 10 to 8 to 6? Which is better and is there a difference? or should I maintain my rep count whilst increasing weight? Then again, looking at my body frame of height 5'10, weight 115 pounds, 26 inch waist, 11 inch biceps and just chicken legs, which will be better for me? I intend to continue going to the gym for many coming years. 

When I do a three-day push/pull/legs split, I do squats on leg day and deadlifts on pull day. It's for exactly the reason you're asking about. Squats and deadlifts on the same day would be too much. This way, each of the three days is anchored by a big compound lift at the start: bench press on push day, deadlift on pull day, and squat on leg day. In a two-day split I still like to keep them separate. There's so much overlap between them and I want to have maximum energy for each, so they belong on separate days. I'd rather combine bench or overhead press with squats since the overlap between them is much less and I can still get good results on bench after killing myself with heavy squats. 

For men, the stomach is often the last place that fat is lost. It changes from person to person, but you'll lose fat in a particular order, pretty much the opposite of the order in which you put it on. Most men put on belly fat first and lose it last. If you've lost fat, look at other places first: your arms, back, thighs, chest, face, etc. 

Your biceps are not going to grow if you're in a caloric deficit. You can only preserve the muscle you already have while your body sheds fat. Eventually your biceps will appear more toned as you lose fat and retain the muscle. If you want to grow your biceps, you'll need to stop cutting and go on a bulk. Eat at a caloric surplus and lift heavy and you'll put on muscle mass. You can't do both, though. You can't lose fat and grow muscle. It's one or the other. Either way, you'd do well not to obsess too much about particular body parts. 2.5 months isn't that much time in the grand scheme of things where people spend years in the gym honing their bodies. Be patient. Don't fall into the trap of continually adjusting your routine because you're yearning for quicker results. There's only so much you can do in a short time period. Ultimately you have to just put in the time. 

No. When you're in a calorie deficit, your body must burn fuel to make up for that deficit. That fuel can be muscle or fat. When you lift weights, you are signalling your body not to burn muscle, and to burn fat instead. Your body will not create new muscle in a deficit. That would simply be counterproductive, using up more calories and creating an even bigger deficit. The purpose of lifting is to trigger body recomposition. Instead of losing both fat and muscle as you lose weight, lifting shifts the balance so you burn more fat and less lean muscle. That is the real purpose of lifting on a cut: to retain the muscle you have, so proportionally speaking, you are more muscular. Also, while you won't build muscle on a cut, you can gain strength. And lots of it. These strength gains are due to improved CNS functioning and muscle utilization rather than added muscle mass. You gain strength by way of your body learning how to lift weights better.
