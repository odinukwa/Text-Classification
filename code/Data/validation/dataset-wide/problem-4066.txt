How about the Harish-Chandra isomorphism, which computes the centre of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$? 

Since $\ker A = \ker A^2$, the map $\bar{A} : V/\ker A \to V/\ker A$ is injective. Since $V/\ker A$ is finite dimensional, this map is surjective. So for any $x \in V$ we can find $y \in V$ and $z \in \ker A$ such that $x = Ay + z$. Now suppose $ABx = 0$ and let $x = Ay + z$ as above. Then $0 = ABx = ABAy + ABz = A^2By + BAz = A^2By$ because $AB = BA$ and $Az = 0$. So $By \in \ker A^2 = \ker A$ whence $ABy = 0$. So $B(Ay) = 0$ and $Ay \in \ker B$. Hence $x = Ay + z \in \ker B + \ker A$. 

Suppose that $A$ is a not necessarily commutative ring, which is both left and right Noetherian. Given a left $A$-module $N$, and a right $A$-module $M$, there is a general (fourth quadrant, cohomological) spectral sequence due to Ischebeck, with $E_2$ term $$E_2^{p,-q} = \operatorname{Ext}^p_A(\operatorname{Ext}^q_A(N,A),M)$$ which converges to $$\operatorname{Tor}^A_{q-p}(M,N)$$ whenever $M$ has finite injective dimension. If, in addition, $A$ has finite injective dimension $d = \operatorname{id}(A) < \infty$, then whenever $n = q-p$ with $0 \leq q \leq d$ and $p \geq 0$, we must have $n \leq d$. Thus $\operatorname{Tor}^A_n(M,N)$ vanishes for any left $A$-module $N$ and any $n > d$. So, if $M$ has finite injective dimension, then $$\operatorname{fd}(M) \leq \operatorname{id}(A)$$ which gives a positive answer to your question because your ring $A$ is assumed to be Gorenstein, hence has finite self-injective dimension. You can find an English translation of Ischebeck's paper here; see Theorem (1.8). 

Let $A$ and $B$ be Hecke eigenforms of some weight $k$ and level $N$. We know that there are irreducible representations $\rho_a$, $\rho_b$ of the absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$ whose trace of Frobenius of $p$ is given by $a_p$ or $b_p$, the Fourier coefficients of $A$ or $B$. $AB$ is a modular form of weight $2k$. It isn't clearly a Hecke eigenform, but its Fourier coefficients are still algebraic numbers, and it can be expressed as a sum of Hecke eigenforms and possibly an Eisenstein series of weight $2k$. We also have $\rho_a \otimes \rho_b$ a representation. It isn't irreducible, but can be expressed as a sum of irreducibles. The obvious hope is that this would correspond to the product, but that cannot be true because the characters don't match up. But convolution if appropriately defined would produce a form related to $\rho_a \otimes \rho_b$. So my two questions: what is multiplication of modular forms representation-theoretically, and what is tensoring of representations on the modular forms side? 

Conway and Sloane, as well as Cassels, and also O'Meara, all have their own idiosyncratic way of expressing the following result (for good primes): Every quadratic form with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is equivalent by a change of variables with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}_p$ to one expressible as $\oplus_{i} p^{e_i}h(\epsilon_i, m_i)$, where $h(\epsilon_i, m_i)$ is $y_1^2+y_2^2+\ldots+y_{m_i}^2$ if $\epsilon_i=0$, and $y_1^2+y_2^2+\ldots+ry_{m_i}^2$ with $r$ a quadratic nonresidue if $\epsilon_i=1$. Furthermore there is a quadratic form $f$ over the integers with given local components $f_i$ if and only if the compatibility conditions for rational equivalence are satisfied. In the case of rational equivalence this has been given an effective treatment by Kirschmer and a coauthor whose name escapes me right now: given a discriminant and a list of primes where the form should have negative Hasse-Witt invariant, they compute a quadratic form. What I would like is a function that given a discriminant (as an integer), and a list of local components, computes a quadratic form in the given genus, i.e. computes the form $f$ described above. 

Since $A$ is regular local commutative ring, it's an integral domain. Let $S = A - 0$ so that the localisation $A_S$ is the field of fractions $F$ of $A$. Assuming the algebra $A$ is central in $R$, $S$ is a central multiplicative subset in $R$. So we can localise at it and form the localised $F$-algebra $B := R_S$. The corresponding canonical $B$-bimodule $B^\ast = Hom_F(B,F)$ is the localisation of $\omega_R$ at $S$, so we see that $\bullet$ if $\omega_R \otimes_R M$ is torsion-free as an $A$-module then $B^\ast \otimes_B M_S$ is non-zero. So in the case when $A$ is already a field, your question is equivalent to asking whether $B^\ast$ is a faithful right $B$-module. This is not true in general: here is an example. Let $B$ be the upper-triangular $2 \times 2$ matrix ring with entries in a field $F$, so $B = F e_{11} \oplus F e_{12} \oplus F e_{22}$. Then you can compute that the action of $B$ on $B^\ast = Fe_{11}^\ast \oplus Fe_{12}^\ast \oplus F e_{22}^\ast$ satisfies $e_{22}^\ast \cdot e_{12} = e_{22}^\ast$ $e_{11}^\ast \cdot e_{11} = e_{11}^\ast$, and $e_{12}^\ast \cdot e_{11} = e_{12}^\ast$. So if $J$ is the maximal ideal of $B$ spanned over $F$ by $e_{11}$ and $e_{12}$ then $B^\ast\cdot J = B^\ast$ which forces $B^\ast \otimes_B (B / J) = 0$ and shows that $B^\ast$ is not a faithful right $B$-module. In the positive direction, it is enough for $R$ to be a Frobenius extension of $A$ for $\omega_R$ to be isomorphic to $R$ as an $R$-bimodule; then of course $\omega_R \otimes_R M$ is just $M$ as an $R$-module and therefore $A$-torsionfree. You can find more information about Frobenius extensions in a paper by Bell and Farnsteiner: $URL$ 

Let $G$ and $H$ be groups over the ring of integers $R$ of a local field $F$ with finite residue characteristic $p$. Suppose we have a surjection $\phi$ from $G(F)$ to $H(F)$, and another surjection $\bar{\phi}$ from $G(k)$ to $H(k)$. Is this enough to conclude the image of a parahoric in $G$ is a parahoric in $H$? 

Sato-Tate has a much more general form in random matrix theory stating that the Satake parameters are distributed as the eigenvalues of some random matrix in a compact Lie group related to the Zariski closure of the image of the associated Galois representation. The measure is just the Haar measure on that group. This applies to abelian representations, and recovers Hecke's equidistribution result. 

Let $K$ be an abelian extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We know that $[x, K]|_{\mathrm{Gal}{\mathbb{Q}^{ab}}}=[\mathrm{N}^{K}_{\mathbb{Q}} x, \mathbb{Q}]$ where $[x, F]$ is the Artin reciprocity map. Given a modulus $\mathfrak{m}$ of $K$, we get a modulus $\mathrm{N}^{K}_{\mathbb{Q}} \mathfrak{m}$. While I can write down abstractly how the Galois groups of the corresponding ray class fields are related, I don't know how the fields are related: will they embed in an easily understood manner? 

The answer is yes. There is a sign walk entirely within each compartment that removes the minus signs and produces the same normalized symbol for each train. Therefore the compartments of the two different trains are isomorphic as they have the same normalized symbol, even if that normalized symbol isn't the symbol of an actual quadratic form. 

I find it helpful to first work through the definition of multiplication on $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}$ when $m = \infty$, in which case it reduces to the "classical" ring of differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck; read sections 16.7 and 16.8 of EGA 4, Quatrième partie. So let $A$ be a commutative base ring, let $S = Spec(A)$ and let $X = \mathbb{A}^1_S$ so that $B = A[t] = \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O})$. We want to work out $\mathcal{D}^{(\infty)}(X)$. Let $Y = X \times_S X$ and $m = \infty$. Let $n \geq 0$. First we have to work out the global sections of the sheaf $\mathcal{P}^n_{Xm}(Y)$, considered as a $B$-module. This will turn out to be dual (as a $B$-module) to the $B$-module of all Grothendieck differential operators of order at most $n$. Now $\mathcal{O}(Y) = B \otimes_A B$ is isomorphic as an $A$-algebra to the polynomial ring $A[t,t']$ where $t \mapsto t \otimes 1$ and $t' \mapsto 1 \otimes t$. The diagonal immersion $X \hookrightarrow Y$ corresponds to the algebra surjection $B \otimes_A B \to B$ which is just the multiplication map. So the ideal of the diagonal, namely the kernel of this map, is generated as an ideal by the element $$\tau := t \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes t.$$ Let's view $\mathcal{O}(Y)$ as a $B$-algebra via the map $b \mapsto b \otimes 1$; then $\mathcal{O}(Y) \cong B[\tau]$. By definition (EGA IV, 16.7.1.1), the global sections of $\mathcal{P}^n_{X\infty}(Y)$ are just $$P^n := \mathcal{O}(Y) / (\tau^{n+1})$$ --- this is the algebra of functions on the $n$-th infinitesimal neighbourhood of the diagonal $\tau = 0$ inside $\mathcal{O}(Y)$ (hence the $n+1$ in the exponent). So in particular it is a free $B$-module of rank $n+1$ with generators (the images of) $\tau^i$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$. By definition, $$\mathcal{D}^{(\infty)}_n (X) := Hom_B(P_n, B) =: D_n $$ which is again a free $B$-module of rank $n+1$; let $\{ \partial^{[i]}, i=0, \ldots, n\}$ be the dual basis for this module. Now the multiplication map $D_r \times D_s \to D_{r+s}$ is the $B$-module dual of a map $\delta : P^{r+s} \to P^r \otimes P^s$ which is constructed in EGA IV, Lemma 16.8.9.1. Morally $\delta$ sends $a \otimes b$ to $a \otimes 1 \otimes 1 \otimes b$, as Gros/Le Stum/Quirros mention. This turns out to be a $B$-algebra homomorphism, and tts key property is that $$\delta( \overline{\tau} ) = \overline{ \tau} \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes \overline{\tau}$$ (it is a "primitive element" in an appropriate bialgebra --- see EGA IV.4, 16.8.9.4). Let's now work out how to multiply $\partial^{[i]}$ by $\partial^{[j]}$ (drop the bars for clarity): $$(\partial^{[i]} \cdot \partial^{[j]})(\tau^k) = (\partial^{[i]} \otimes \partial^{[j]})(\tau \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes \tau)^k = \sum_{a + b = k} \binom{k}{a} \partial^{[i]}(\tau^a) \partial^{[j]}(\tau^b)$$ which is just $\binom{i+j}{i}\delta_{k,i+j}$. Since $\binom{i+j}{i} \partial^{[i+j]}$ has the same effect on each $\tau^k$, we deduce that $$ \partial^{[i]} \cdot \partial^{[j]} = \binom{i+j}{i} \partial^{[i+j]}$$ which is hopefully the familiar rule for multiplying divided powers (morally $\partial^{[i]} = \partial^i/i!$). The point of the Berthelot construction is that it is possible to vary the divided-power structure on the diagonal, and thereby control just how many divided powers one gets in $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}$. For example, if $m = 0$ then you instead allow all divided powers on the ideal of the diagonal (algebraically this means you consider the divided power algebra of the ideal $(\tau)$ in $B[\tau]$ to get $\oplus_{n=0}^\infty B \tau^{[n]}$), and when you take the $B$-dual, these divided powers in $\tau$ "remove" the divided powers in $\partial$ and you end up with $\mathcal{D}^{(0)}(X) = B[\partial]$, the ring of crystalline differential operators (no divided powers). Now to answer your question, let the level $m \geq 0$ be fixed. Then as Gros/Le Stum/Quirros explain just before Definition 2.5, $$\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{P}^n_{Xm}(Y)) = \oplus_{a=0}^n B \tau^{ \{ a \} } $$ where $\tau^{ \{ a \} }$ is a symbol that "behaves like $\tau^a / q_a!$" (where $q_a$ is the integer part of $a / p^m$: thus $a = q_a p^m + r_a$ say). To understand the multiplication of the dual vectors to these $\tau^{ \{ a \} }$, namely the $\partial^{ \langle a \rangle }$, we need to understand how to comultiply the $\tau^{ \{ a \} }$. So we compute (again dropping bars for convenience) $$ \delta( \tau^{ \{ a \} }) = \frac{1}{q_a!} \delta(\tau)^a = \sum_{i+j = a} \frac{1}{q_a!} \binom{i+j}{i} \tau^i \otimes \tau^j = \sum_{i+j = a} \frac{q_i! q_j!}{q_{i+j}!} \binom{i+j}{i} \tau^{ \{ i \} } \otimes \tau^{ \{ j \} }$$ and the same computation as above in the case $m=\infty$ shows that $$ \partial^{\langle i \rangle} \cdot \partial^{\langle j \rangle} = \frac{q_i! q_j!}{q_{i+j}!} \binom{i+j}{i} \partial^{\langle i + j \rangle}.$$ The interesting thing is that this structure constant $\frac{q_i! q_j!}{q_{i+j}!} \binom{i+j}{i}$ is always a $p$-integral rational number (see Lemma 1.1.3(i) in Berthelot's paper), so it makes sense whenever $A$ is an algebra over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, say, and in particular if $A$ had characteristic $p$. Note that if $A$ was a $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra, then there would be a ring homomorphism from $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}$ to $A[t; \partial]$ which sends $$ \partial^{\langle i \rangle} \mapsto \frac{q_i!\partial^i}{i!} $$ since $$ \left(\frac{q_i! \partial^i}{i!}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{q_j! \partial^j}{j!}\right) = \frac{q_i! q_j!}{q_{i+j}!} \binom{i+j}{i} \left( \frac{q_{i+j}! \partial^{i+j}}{(i+j)!}\right).$$ Thus morally $\partial^{\langle i \rangle}$ should be thought of as "modified divided powers" $q_i! \partial^i / i!$. Finally, you don't need all of the $\partial^{\langle i \rangle}$ to generate $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}$. As is well-known, the full ring of Grothendieck differential operators in characteristic $p$ can be generated by the divided powers $\partial^{[p^a]}$ (for all $a \geq 0$). Since $q_i = 0$ for $i < p^m$ and $q_{p^m} = 1$, the modified divided powers $\partial^{\langle p^i \rangle}$ are equal to the "true" divided powers $\partial^{[p^i]}$ for $0 \leq i \leq m$. If $a > m$ then since $q_{p^a} = p^{a-m}$, $$\partial^{\langle p^a \rangle} = \frac{ p^{a-m}! }{ p^a! } \partial^{p^a} = \left(\frac{ p^{a-m}! (p^m!)^{p^{a-m}} }{p^a!} \right) (\partial^{\langle p^m \rangle})^{p^{a-m}}$$ shows that $\partial^{\langle p^a \rangle}$ is a $p$-adic unit times a power of $\partial^{\langle p^m \rangle}$ for $a \geq m$ since the $p$-adic valuation of that big fraction is $$\frac{p^{a-m}-1}{p-1} + p^{a-m} \frac{p^m-1}{p-1} - \frac{p^a-1}{p-1} = 0.$$ So we see that $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}(\mathbb{A}^1_S)$ in this case is the $A$-algebra generated by $t$ and the divided powers $\partial^{[p^0]}, \partial^{[p^1]}, \ldots, \partial^{[p^m]}$, subject to appropriate natural relations. Edit: To see what the map $X \to P_{Xm}(Y)$ looks like in the case $X = \mathbb{A}^1_S$, it is enough to describe the corresponding map $C := \mathcal{O}(P_{Xm}(Y)) \to B = \mathcal{O}(X)$ on functions, because everything in sight is affine. $C$ is a $B$-algebra, generated by symbols $\tau^{ \{a \} }$ for all $a \geq 1$ subject to the relations $$\tau^{ \{a \} } \cdot \tau^{ \{b \} } = \frac{q_{a+b}!}{q_a!q_b!} \tau^{ \{ a + b \} }$$ (note that the structure constant $\frac{q_{a+b}!}{q_a!q_b!}$ is actually an integer, this again follows from Lemma 1.1.3(i) in Berthelot's paper.) The map $C \to B$ sends all of the generators $\tau^{ \{a \} }$ to zero, and the map $C \to P^n$ which corresponds to the closed subscheme $P^n_{Xm}(Y)$ of $P_{Xm}(Y)$ sends all of the $\tau^{ \{ a \} }$ to zero for $a \geq n+1$. This description makes it easy to see that the algebra of functions $C$ on $P_{Xm}(Y)$ is isomorphic to the polynomial ring $B[\tau]$ when $m = \infty$ (since we can take $q_a$ to be always zero in this case), and to the "free" divided-power algebra $B[\tau^{[n]} : n\geq 1]$ that Gros/Le Stum/Quirros call $\Gamma_\bullet(B \tau)$ when $m = 0$. This is because $q_a = a$ in this case, so the defining relations between the $\tau^{ \{a \}}$ reduce to $$\tau^{ \{a \} } \cdot \tau^{ \{b \} } = \binom{a+b}{a} \tau^{ \{ a + b \} }.$$ 

Consider an elliptic curve. This is $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ is a lattice. As a real manifold this is a two dimensional manifold. Therefore, if we want to have an etale cohomology theory compatible with the real cohomology theory the dimension should be two. 

I've got a new criterion for comparing Galois reps which are four dimensional if we know the kernel of the residual representation mod $5$ (or any large odd prime) and the Sato-Tate groups (should be same for each one) are connected. Note that we don't need to have a large residual image, so this applies to a different set of representations than Faltings-Serre. It also doesn't use a large tower, making it stronger and more efficient than existing variants of the Livne method. What I don't have are some good examples: the one I was working on when I discovered this method really requires a criterion that works for $p=2$, which is a lot more complicated (and I don't have a handle on yet). So does anyone have some Galois representations to compare lying around meeting my critera? The kernel of the residual representation may be hard to determine on the automorphic side: I'm working on ways to fix that. 

Numerical Recipes, 3rd edition, Chapter 3 describes a vast number of interpolation methods with source code. It seems from what you are telling us that something is confused in the paper: Chebyshev interpolation has to do with picking points at which to minimize error of the ensuing result, but perhaps something else was meant/the usage is slightly different. 

No; it is not abelian in general. Let $R$ be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal generated by an element $\pi$, let $k := R / \pi R$ be the residue field of $R$ and let $\mathcal{O}$ be the inverse image in $M_2(R)$ of the scalar matrices in $M_2(k)$. Note that $\mathcal{O}$ is free of rank $4$ as an $R$-module, with basis $\{e_{11} + e_{22}, \pi e_{11}, \pi e_{12}, \pi e_{21}\}$ say. So $\mathcal{O}$ is, in particular, finitely generated and projective as an $R$-module. For every $g \in GL_2(R)$, you have the invertible fractional ideal $\mathcal{O}g$. Note that $\mathcal{O}g \cdot \mathcal{O} h = \mathcal{O} gh$ since $GL_2(R)$ normalises $\mathcal{O}$ inside $M_2(R)$. Note also that $\mathcal{O} g = \mathcal{O} h$ if and only if $gh^{-1} \in \mathcal{O}^\times$, which is the preimage in $GL_2(R)$ of the group of scalar matrices in $GL_2(k)$. So we obtain an injective group homomorphism from $PGL_2(k) \cong GL_2(R) / \mathcal{O}^\times$ into the group $I(\mathcal{O})$ of invertible fractional ideals of $\mathcal{O}$. In the positive direction, if $K$ is the field of fractions of a Dedekind domain $R$ and if $\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal order in some finite dimensional separable $K$-algebra, then $I(\mathcal{O})$ is abelian. See Theorem 12 and Theorem 13(c) of this paper by Frőhlich, which gives a thorough discussion of the Picard group of a noncommutative ring. 

No. If $A = k[x,y]$ is the polynomial ring in two variables, $\mathfrak{p}$ is the zero ideal, $N = A_{\mathfrak{p}} = k(x,y)$ is the field of fractions of $A$, $M := (x,y) \subsetneq M' := A \subseteq N$ all satisfy your conditions. But the only associated prime of $M' / M$ is $(x,y)$ which has height $2$. 

In Claus Sorenson's PhD thesis, he proves a theorem about level lifting of paramodular forms whose associated automorphic representation has component $\pi_{\infty}$ that is the "cohomological holomorphic discrete series representation". But it isn't clear to me why the definite article is appropriate, or how to translate this description into Blattner parameters. So what is this representation, and why it is unique as defined above? 

The image of $\Lambda_2$ in $G/\Lambda_1$ is finite. Take a set of representatives $s_1, s_2, \ldots s_n$ in $\Lambda_2$. Now consider $\cup s_i F_2$. I claim this is a Borel fundamental domain for $F_1$. It is Borel as it is a finite union of Borel sets. Let $g\Lambda_1$ be a coset of $\Lambda_1$. Then $g\Lambda_2$ intersects $F_2$ in a single point $x$. Now, $\Lambda_2 = \cup s_i \Lambda_1$, and so $x$ is in some $s_i$ translate of $F_2$, and hence in $F_1$. It is unique as otherwise we have $s_i \lambda_1 = s_j \lambda_1'$, which would mean our set of representatives was too big in the first place. 

Let $L/\mathbb{Q}$ be a Galois closed field with Galois group a subgroup of $S_6$. Is it the case that $L$ is the compositum of Galois closures of linearly disjoint fields of degree at most $6$ over $\mathbb{Q}$? Currently this looks true from a bashing argument: taking each subgroup of $S_6$ up to isomorphism and either noting it is a direct product, or it has a large subgroup which is not normal and whose normalizer is the whole subgroup. Bashing argument isn't complete yet, so this might still be false. I'd like something more elegant though, and if it works for $S_n$ even better. 

Over a general ring (not necessarily commutative), every finitely presented flat module is projective. So, one simple condition on the ring that gives you what you want is that every finitely generated module is finitely presented. Of course, these are just the (left) Noetherian rings. 

In general, it is not true that $Ann_R(M)$ is a maximal two-sided ideal of $R$ if $M$ is a simple $R$-module. For example, let $k$ be a field of characteristic zero, let $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{sl}_2(k)$ and let $A = U(\mathfrak{g}) / \langle C \rangle$ where $C$ is the Casimir element. Then the Verma module $V$ of highest weight $-2$ for $\mathfrak{g}$ is a simple faithful $A$-module (so $Ann_A(V) = 0$), but the zero ideal in $A$ isn't maximal since it's contained in the proper two-sided ideal $\mathfrak{g}\cdot A$. Annihilators of simple modules are called primitive ideals; whilst any maximal two-sided ideal $I$ in a ring $R$ is necessarily primitive (simply pick a maximal left ideal $J$ containing $I$ and consider the simple module $R/J$), the converse is not true as the above example shows. As Ralph notes, in the general setting of non-commutative rings, the localisation $R_{\mathfrak{m}}$ does not exist: one needs certain Ore conditions to be satisfied by the set $S$ of elements in $R$ that are non-zero-divisors modulo $\mathfrak{m}$. Even if the Ore localisation $R_\mathfrak{m}$ exists, it could happen that the Ore localisation $M_{\mathfrak{m}}$ is zero. This is actually the case for the $A$-module $V$ considered above: since $A$ is a Noetherian domain, the set $S$ of all non-zero elements of $A$ is an Ore set, but $V$ is a torsion $A$-module so $V_S = 0$. It's known that $pd_A(V) = 1$ in this case, so the inequality $pd_R(M) \geq pd_{R_{\mathfrak{m}}}(M_{\mathfrak{m}})$ is strict in general. In the positive direction, however, it is known that flat dimension behaves well under Ore localisation. More precisely: suppose that $S$ is a two-sided denominator set in a ring $R$ and let $N$ be an $R_S$-module. Then the flat dimension of $N$ as an $R_S$-module is equal to the flat dimension of $N$ as an $R$-module; this is Proposition 7.4.2(iii) of the book Noncommutative Noetherian Rings by McConnell and Robson. For a finitely generated module $M$ over a Noetherian ring $R$, flat dimension coincides with projective dimension (see section 7.1.5 of the book cited above). This is enough to give a positive answer to your question under the following extra hypotheses:
