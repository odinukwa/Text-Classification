This is one of the rare cases where using Deny permissions is actually useful. It may be more convenient to add a deny permission than to change the allow permissions. You can do this from the command line (on Vista or later) like this: 

I don't believe so, but one workaround is to implement an intercepting proxy server on your network. This means that you can configure the WSUS server to instruct clients to download from Microsoft, but still cache the content locally for machines on your network. (As an added bonus, updates will only be downloaded if they are actually needed, so you can be less selective about what you approve.) A variation of this is to configure WinHTTP on your desktop machines to use a proxy server, although this means laptops that are on-site will still download from Microsoft. In principle you could write some software that detects the current location of the machine and reconfigures WinHTTP as necessary. 

Since you can't even ping after joining the domain, the problem is somewhere in the networking stack and has nothing to do with the trust relationship per se. (This means the usual troubleshooting steps for trust relationship errors, such as rejoining the domain, don't apply.) My bet is that the Windows Firewall domain settings are messed up. To confirm this, turn Windows Firewall off (briefly!) and see if that lets you ping. If it does, check the settings, or try using the "Restore Defaults" option in the Windows Firewall control panel. 

In Windows Setup, you can press Shift+F10 to get a command line window. From there you can navigate to \boot and run memtest. You may need to use trial and error to see which drive letter the USB key has been assigned. This will vary depending on what partitions are on the internal drives. 

In Windows 10, the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) can be launched by repeatedly cutting power to the computer during the boot sequence. This allows an attacker with physical access to a desktop machine to gain administrative command-line access, at which point they can view and modify files, reset the administrative password using various techniques, and so on. (Note that if you launch WinRE directly, you must provide a local administrative password before it will give you command line access; this does not apply if you launch WinRE by repeatedly interrupting the boot sequence. Microsoft have confirmed that they do not consider this to be a security vulnerability.) In most scenarios this doesn't matter, because an attacker with unrestricted physical access to the machine can usually reset the BIOS password and gain administrative access by booting from removable media. However, for kiosk machines, in teaching labs, and so on, measures are usually taken to restrict physical access by, e.g., padlocking and/or alarming the machines. It would be very inconvenient to have to also try to block user access to both the power button and the wall socket. Supervision (either in person or via surveillance cameras) might be more effective, but someone using this technique would still be far less obvious than, e.g., someone attempting to open the computer case. How can the system administrator prevent WinRE from being used as a back door? 

You are still potentially vulnerable unless you have configured the server to only use the newer protocol. You can do this as follows: 

You should find life easier if you explicitly turn off NetBIOS over TCP/IP. You can do this from the WINS tab of Advanced TCP/IP Settings, or via your DHCP server. 

Yes, this is possible. The Account Lockout Policy for domain users is defined by the settings in either the Default Domain Policy or the Default Domain Controllers Policy object. The documentation is unclear (see here and compare to here) as to which of these contain the domain user settings by default, and does not describe how the settings for user accounts are located in non-default configurations. It may depend upon the version of Windows Server. In any case, we can easily avoid depending on the exact behaviour. Your member workstations should already be located in one or more OUs. If you create a group policy object and apply it to those OUs, the Account Lockout Policy settings in that GPO will take precedence over the settings in the Default Domain Policy object (if any). The Default Domain Controllers Policy object only applies to the Domain Controllers OU so they will not affect your member servers in any case. Provided that you don't apply your GPO to the root of the domain, the Domain Controllers OU, or at the Site level, it definitely won't affect domain user accounts, even if those accounts are logging into the servers in question. (It should be possible to apply the GPO at the root of the domain and make it work, but the details are a bit complicated so I don't recommend trying it.) 

I think you want the Volume Shadow Copy Services. On a server platform, the Diskshadow command-line interface is available. 

One possibility: if you can find the GUID volume name (your question doesn't make this clear) and if the volume has a drive letter assigned, then Win32_Volume will link the GUID volume name to the drive letter and Win32_LogicalDiskToPartition will link the drive letter to the disk number and partition number. However, looks to be a better option. This command works for me: 

This is because Java 8u171 disables the use of the 3DES_EDE_CBC cipher when making TLS connections. Apparently the client (or the BMC itself) is incapable of using more modern ciphers, even with the most recent firmware. You can reconfigure Java by editing the file. This can be found in (Java 8 or earlier) or in (Java 9 or later). You need to remove from the setting for . For example, the default setting in Java 8u171 is 

Instead of trying to muck around with SMB on the server, you should investigate using a VPN. Windows Server includes both DirectAccess and Routing and Remote Access, either of which should be able to solve your problem. Your networking equipment may also have VPN support. 

This occurs when the installation package includes Project Felix, whose system requirements include Windows 10 as the minimum supported operating system. You can work around the problem by excluding Project Felix from the package. Unfortunately, the Creative Cloud Packager does not include information about which specific applications have unusual minimum requirements, and the installation log does not appear to include information about which application has caused the failure, so it is necessary to either research each application individually or to resort to a process of elimination to determine where the problem lies. 

I also recommend using a machine with a direct internet connection rather than one that accesses the internet via a proxy server. (Especially if the proxy server requires authentication.) 

We were a bit worried about that, because on several of our servers LOM1 is attached to a dedicated management network and LOM2 is attached to the LAN, and we don't want the DRAC to be accessible from the LAN. The puzzling thing is that, experimentally, it doesn't seem to be true. (Details below.) With the DRAC configured in shared mode, the DRAC is only reachable from LOM1, not from LOM2. Is the article wrong? If not, how do I get the DRAC to respond on LOM2? (Short of using Failover mode which according to the article requires teaming, i.e., both LOMs must be on the same network.) Most importantly, what, if anything, do I need to do to be certain that none of our DRACs are accessible via LOM2? 

One possible solution that doesn't require a (hazardous) repartitioning would be to make the C drive the active partition. Of course, you'll need to use system repair (or some other means) to install the boot loader on the C drive or the system won't be bootable! It is likely that MDT will then correctly identify the C drive as the active partition and put WinPE there. 

You can convert the event trace logs into plain text using from the Windows 10 SDK. First, copy the files from on the target machine to a convenient location on your admin machine. Open a command line window, change to the directory containing the copy of the trace files, and run the following command:
