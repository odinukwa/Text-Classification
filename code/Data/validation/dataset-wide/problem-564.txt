A lot of road positioning is about reducing frontal area. Keeping your elbows in reduces your frontal area thereby reducing the amount of new turbulence created as you move through the air. Reducing your frontal area allows for greater speeds to be attained for the same level of effort. While critical for racing, a recreational rider may benefit from comfort over aerodynamics. I recently shifted to much wider road bars (44 cm instead of 42) with an additional flare in the drops (which adds another 4 cm). This sticks my elbow out relative to more standard road bars. I know I am less aerodynamic with this setup, but I am also a lot more comfortable. It opens up my breathing, and makes the bike easier to handle on mixed terrain (i.e., gravel and dirt). For me this compromise is worth the loss of efficiency (for this bike). Pulling or pushing on the hoods 

Let me expand on the answer provided by @Mac. There are two important concepts here that need to be unpacked, 1) endurance training when in a fasted state and 2) eating either before or during an endurance training ride. If your goal is improved fat metabolism, endurance training in a fasted state (e.g., 8 hours without food, no eating during exercise) shows larger gains than training under a fed state (i.e., eating either before or during exercise). Eating carbohydrates at any point inhibits fat metabolism, if improving fat metabolism is your goal, then this is bad. That said, I am also skeptical that prioritizing fat metabolism should be your training goal. See below for more details. Background The goal of base (endurance) training is typically to improve the metabolic efficiency and recruitment of your type 1 muscle fibres, the muscle fibres type with the greatest ability to perform endurance work. Training must be done by using slow long rides (typical heart rate zone 2). The low effort ensures most pedal force is generated by type 1 fibres and because type 1 muscle fibres generate the energy largely through fatty acid oxidation, your activity will be mostly powered by fat metabolism. If you start heading out of zone 2 (harder effort) you will recruit more of your type 2a muscle fibres and start using glycogen and blood glucose to fuel muscle contraction (note some blood glucose is used even during fat metabolism, this point is important, see the bonking section) as well as accumulate a lactate debt (your mitochondria in your muscles will no longer be able to process the lactate within, dumping lactate into your blood stream). Endurance training in a fasted state. A large number of studies (e.g., De Bock 2005, De Bock 2008, and Van Proeyen 2010) have show that consistent training in a fasted state (i.e., glycogen depleted state) can resulted in an increased capacity for muscles (type 1 and some evidence for type 2a) to oxidize fatty acids and as well as other health benefits (e.g., insulin response/glucose tolerance, reduced weight gain under higher energy diets) and other performance benefits (e.g., faster glycogen resynthesis see De Bock 2005). These same fat metabolism benefits were not obtained by individuals who were well fed with carbohydrates both before and during the exercise. The fasted individuals had abstained from eating for 8 hours prior to the exercise regime and did not eat during. Depending on the study individuals exercised between 1-2 hours at an output of about 175 W. This part is key as the studies used shorter periods than the 2+ hours for your training plan. Fat metabolism actually requires glucose to prime the reaction. If you ride too long in the fasted state you will eventually run the risk running out of blood glucose you will feel the sensation called "hitting the wall" or "bonking." Low blood glucose levels also affects neurological functioning, you can become light headed and will have trouble focusing. Your muscle firing patterns will also deteriorate. As such you need to be very careful if trying to do prolonged endurance training in a fasted state. The participates in the science experiments where carefully monitored during both the exercise and the recovery periods. Eating while exercising? This gets us to your primary question of whether or not to eat. If you are aiming to train in a fasted state, eating during exercise will also inhibit the prioritization of fat metabolism (De Bock 2008). This will be the same if you ingest carbohydrates prior to your ride. Therefore if you want to maximize fat metabolism, exercise in zone 2 in a fasted state and don't eat carbohydrates either before or during. Eating before exercise, but not during. I haven't found any studies that test eating a meal before training, but riding without food (please correct me if I missed a study). I suspect when you start out your body will prioritize glycogen, the switch to fat as your stores run low. I am not clear how efficient the transition will occur or if you increase the probability of bonking. Even if your body successfully made this transition, you would still have a smaller window of prioritized fat metabolism and therefore lower gains. General Advice / Caveats In my opinion training in a fasted state is an advanced technique that should be done carefully and under supervision and restricted to pro/elite athletes who know their body well and can intercept when something is going wrong (e.g., deterioration of muscle firing efficiency, bonking, etc). If you insist on attempting to training in a fasted state, I suggest caring energy gels and food so that you can intervene if you start to bonk. In terms of improving your fat metabolism, the theory is that this could help you reduce glycogen consumption during a race leaving you with more energy later in the game when decisive tactical maneuvers are often made. While I am sure this is true, I think it may be over emphasized for most amateur athletes. You can also maintain your glycogen stores simply by regularly consuming carbohydrates during a race (see Coyle et al 1986). If you are at a Pro / Cat 1 level then better fat metabolism could give you an additional edge, but I am highly sceptical that athletes below this level will see real benefits over improved training volume and improved focus during training. Both of these will be inhibited in a fasted state. 

This is the common wisdom, but I personally question it. Over the last 3 years I have been carefully recording chain longevity under different lubes and conditions. Under the same conditions (brand/model of chain and season) a thicker wet lube resulted in longer chain life. Sometimes the difference relative to a light or dry lube was startlingly (e.g., 1000 km more life on an Ultegra chain). I suspect the thicker/stickier lube remains in place better (some sort of hydrodyamic property that I can't remember the technical term). As for debris, it does have an effect, but I suspect it is somewhat over-rated as I only see a small drop (e.g., ~300-500 km) during the winter under the same lube chain combo and in some pretty nasty muddy conditions as I keep off the main roads and ride on more gravel during the winter. In the end I suspect choice and frequency and quality of lubing may actually play the biggest role! 

Road brake calipers are built with "reach" dimensions. The reach is the distance from the center mounting bolt to the pads. Usually this is a range of values (e.g., 47mm-57mm) as you can adjust the pad vertically within the caliper. It is important you replace the caliper with another caliper of the same reach. If you do not get the appropriate reach you will not be able to position the brake pads to engage the rim braking surface. Generally, there are 3 common sizes for road brake calipers. 

Put a larger tire on the front and don't worry about running a larger tire on the rear. Back when North Shore BC riding was just starting to take off (i.e., 1990s) we often did this setup as we were equipment limited. At the time the "thinking" was that it was bizarre ride a tire bigger than a 2.0 anything but a dedicated race downhill bike. So we would often swap a fork and run bigger rubber up front as there was clearance issues in the rear. Now 25 years later and anything less than 2.3 is pretty much considered anemic for most riding. Anyway, the mismatch tire size works fine. The front is where you are often traction limited as you brake and steer with this tire. A small rear tire may mean a bit harsher ride (i.e., higher pressure with all other things equal) and a tad less traction, but you can afford this compromise on the rear. Plus, one tire is cheaper than two, and if any one asks just tell them the setup is more aero (#AeroIsEverything - /sarcasm). 

CX bikes are road bikes that are designed to hold a line well in rough terrain (i.e., front steering doesn't overly react to bumps) yet responsive to slow turn-ins (European CX courses have epic number of turns - many North American courses are like drag races). This is done by combining slower steering and a higher bottom bracket. Therefore you initiate sharp turn-ins with a quick hip flick (this differs from road bikes which respond less to hip flicks due to the lower BB). With this in mind the bikes feel best when you are in a balanced position without too much weight on your hands. This leaves the bike responsive to steering from the hips. Too much weight on your hands and the front end slows down further in its response to the weight change making the bike feel less responsive to hip movements. By balance you should be supporting most of your weight through your core, with little weight on your hands. The steering will feel lighter the more responsive when you start to get this right. Setup steps: 

Welding the pedal to the crank should NEVER be done. Pedal threads are oriented such that in the event of a pedal bearings becoming jammed the pedals will unscrew from the cranks rather than injure the rider. Severe injury is possible if the pedal jams while pedaling at a fast cadence or on a bike that does not have a freewheel or freehub body (e.g. fixed gear). I have personally have had pedal bearings jam, while pedaling at an incredibly high rate of cadence and was thankful that the pedal simply unthreaded rather than damage my knee or ankle. 

There will be windup (flex in the crank under force). Both the drive side (spiders and chain ring) and the non-drive side (shaft, spiders and chain ring) will experience windup during power transfer. The amount of wind up is however very small (and depends on the magnitude of the force applied), but will be slightly higher for the non-drive side as more components are involved. That said, once the small amount of windup has occurred (at the start of the power stroke), both sides will transfer force with equal efficiency for the rest of the pedal stroke. Because the windup is so small, overall efficiency between sides will be essential identical. As an aside frame flex will be a much bigger component, convince your self by locking your brakes and apply force to either crank and see what flexes. I find I have better power transfer with the right amount of frame flex as it allows me to get into a rhythm that I can best describe as like riding a wave. Some term this planing. What ever you call it, a bike and components that are too stiff will feel "dead" for lack of better words.
