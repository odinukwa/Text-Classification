Does existing research show, for example, that if A & B relax labour mobility norms, poverty in both these countries reduces? Do note that I'm not talking about domestic labour mobility. 

I'm a student and I want to determine the demand for a product (and consequently determine what will happen if the price of the product increases). I don't have access to any businesses that can provide the data for me (price and demand at that price? How do I estimate the demand curve or function by surveying people? What I currently have in mind is to ask people what amount of the product they'll demand at a given price and extrapolate this data for a city or a region. Additionally, what'd be a good sample size for such a survey? 

Why shouldn't we date many partners in the first place? (so you have two types: monogamic and polygamic --- there are scientific hints that human's are polygamic). That the other partner regards the other's "unconditional interest" as truthful (it can't be truthful to begin with). That they think that making commitments is indeed incentivizing (which is also related to 1). 

Let's find the Marginal Product of Labor, $MP_L$: $$ \begin{align} MP_L \equiv \frac{\partial Y(K,L)}{\partial L} &=\frac{\partial }{\partial L}\left( aK + b L^{0.5} \right) \\ &= 0.5\cdot b \cdot L^{-0.5} \end{align} $$ Now finding $\frac{dMP_L}{dK}$ is trivial: $$ \begin{align} \frac{dMP_L}{dK} &= \frac{d}{dK} \left( 0.5\cdot b \cdot L^{-0.5}\right) = 0 \end{align} $$ We see that it does not depend on the capital. So a change in $MP_L$ 

Recently in a test I was asked to describe the modified IS-LM framework. I assumed I was being asked the IS-LM-BP model, since it modifies the traditional IS LM model by adding a BP curve. I looked up on a couple of references (Macroeconomics by Dornbusch, and Macroeconomics by Olivier Blanchard) but they have no reference to it. Looking the term up on a search engine only throws results about papers that suggest a modification to the IS LM model. What exactly is a modified IS-LM framework? 

You might also find Jagannathan, Skoulakis and Wang. (2014) enlightening to make proper arguments on the appropriateness of the methods if your study is asset pricing related; in corporate finance things are more "flexible". Last, I am far from an expert in this area, but I think the "pre-made" Stata commands are not exhaustive in dealing with variables with different statistical characteristics (e.g. autocorrelated returns). 

I wanted to verify the relationship between inflation and unemployment empirically, so I took data from the World Bank and used excel to correlate them. I got a very, very bad correlation between unemployment and inflation (from 1991 to 2016). Am I doing something wrong here? I took these two sets of indicators: (1) Unemployment, total (modeled ILO estimate) and (2) Inflation, consumer prices. Here are the links: $URL$ and $URL$ I downloaded the data from here and I studied the data for the United States of America. Is the low correlation because of the fact that the market needs time to react to unemployment rates? If so how did Phillips study it in the first place? 

As far as Gali is concerned he defines (on page 16 of his book) $N$ as "hours of work or employment", noting that "$N_t$ can be interpreted as the number of household members employed, assuming a large household and ignoring integer constraints". Then on chapter 3 he talks about a continuum of firms $Y_t(i), \ \ i \in [0,1]$ producing the aggregate output: $$ Y_t \equiv \left( \int_0^1 Y_t(i)^{1 - \frac{1}{\epsilon}}\mathrm{d}i\right)^\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon -1}$$ But small-case $y_t$ refers to the output of the log-linearized equations. Somebody can use $y_t$ as the logarithm of the Gross National Product, so as I perceive it that, this is not output per person. 

I'm currently learning the Mundell Fleming model, and so from my textbook and other sources I've figured out the effect of increase in money supply and government expenditure increase for the following conditions: 

Yes, the diagram represented in the question is correct. Assuming imperfect capital mobility (with the BP curve steeper than the LM curve), an increase in G will: 

Can this one-off cases be extended? For instance, if I employ someone to destroy 50 buildings and rebuild them, does that contribute an increase in GDP? 

2. In Fama and MacBeth regression can individuals under study be different in different time periods? Yes, and this is one of the reasons that Fama-MacBeth is appealing, since you can run it on unbalanced panel datasets. In a balanced panel, every individual has data for the same/every time period, while in an unbalanced this is not a requirement. 1. In panel data application, when using Fama and MacBeth regression is preferable over the fixed or random effect model? Is there a statistical test shedding light on this issue? Usually, in finance, a fixed effect concerns a firm effect (dummy for firms), while Fama-MacBeth is designed to account for a time effect (Petersen (2008)). Random effects are rarely used in the financial literature (Petersen (2008)). As he says: "When the residuals of a panel regression are correlated, not only OLS standard error estimates are biased but also the coefficient estimates are inefficient (the estimates do not exploit all of the information in the data). Researchers can improve efficiency by estimating a random effects model using a GLS approach." To sum up: 

Move the IS curve to the right. At this point (B), there will be a BOP deficit because the point is below the BP curve. Thus, the domestic currency will depreciate. Exports will rise, imports will decrease and thus net exports will rise. This will have two effects: (a) this will shift the IS curve further to the right (because net exports have risen, and so Y has risen) and (b) this will shift the BP curve to the right (because net exports have risen, improving the current account balance). The new equilibrium is at C. 

This is a large comment. Fama-MacBeth only corrects for cross-sectional correlation in a panel and suffers from the error-in-variables problem (your $Z_t$, also check Chordia, Goyal and Shanken (2015)). Depending on the exact nature of your dataset's variables the answer to your questions is "it depends"; please check Goyal (2012), Mitchell (2009) and Ibragimov and Mueller (2010). 

People use the Hausman test to decide between fixed/random effects models, but I find the intuition and justification of the choice of the proper model more appropriate. I am unaware for a specific test which includes Fama-MacBeth but I am far from an expert in the field. 

I found a better diagram illustrating this (the diagram includes two cases: one with the BP flatter than the LM and one steeper; the points and movements marked with an asterik (*) are the ones concerned with the case of BP being steeper than the LM). (Image Courtesy of Polinomics: $URL$ 

If not, what type of trade financing do Chilean exporters or importers get? Is it all from private banks and insurers?
