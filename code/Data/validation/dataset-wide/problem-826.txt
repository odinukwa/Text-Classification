There may be other stress mechanisms that I am not aware of, but these are the main ones. If you want more information about the topic, or want to see some visualizations of what these various stresses look like, check out SatStressGUI, a program I helped developed which models stresses on icy moons. 

According to the NASA press release, the Trappist planets are close enough (only a few million kilometers) that "the tidal forces between the planets are not negligible". The speaker says that this could cause ocean tides on the planets. Are they close enough that the tidal forces could heat the interior of the planets? 

Remember that Copernicus was espousing a heliocentric Solar System. What he means by "pole" is the object's axis of revolution and its axis of rotation. The Earth rotates around its poles: i.e. the North and South pole. A line between those poles is our axis of rotation. The axis of revolution would be the axis about which the Earth orbits. This would correspond to an imaginary line at the Sun. Copernicus is presenting the idea that the axis of rotation is not the axis of revolution. 

Explaining the recession of galaxies due to an explosion also raises many questions: What caused the explosion? Why would it start at one particular point? What were things like before the explosion? All of these are questions which do not have accepted answers. Instead, the expansion of space ties directly into the idea of the Big Bang. The expansion of space itself is what drove the Big Bang. It is not that the universe is expanding into something. Instead, space itself is expanding. However, the topic of the Big Bang is a different subject, so you can look up information on that yourself. 

Now, when we look for exoplanets, things are actually a lot easier. To detect exoplanets we hardly ever look for the planets directly. We've only detected about 20 planets via direct imaging. Instead, we look at the light from the star. The stars are many orders of magnitude brighter than the planets, and are very easy to see. All we have to do is see how the light from the star changes over time. An early method detect shifts in the radial velocity of the star (its motion towards or away from us) using Doppler spectroscopy. The more prevalent method today, the one that the Kepler mission used, is transit photometry. We measure the light output of a star, and look for dips in its intensity, caused by the planet orbiting in front of the star and blocking some of the light. Because we're looking at a star, we don't have the problems we have when looking for Planet Nine. Stars are very bright, their positions are known very accurately, and we don't have to wait too long to make a detection. Plus, surveys like Kepler are able to scan many, many stars at once. 

Olber's Paradox was created at a time before the idea of a finite universe was accepted. (It was thought of in the 1600's). In order to resolve Olber's Paradox, you have to introduce the idea that either the universe had a beginning or it is of finite size. (Note: the solution does not require an expanding universe). So, at the time, it was a paradox. Pretty much all astronomers considered the universe to be static and infinite. Therefore, the fact that their observations didn't fit with what they expected made it a paradox. 

Yes, it is fine to wear eclipse glasses over your eyeglasses. What the article in Ars Technica is talking about is looking through a telescope with eclipse glasses. The telescope would focus the light, burning right through the eclipse glasses. But wearing normal eyeglasses behind eclipse glasses is perfectly fine. 

When we talk about Milky Way kinematics, we define it as rotating clockwise from top. In the rest of physics, rotating objects are defined as rotating counterclockwise from top (following the right-hand rule). Why do we do the opposite when talking about the Milky Way? 

From Wikipedia The first part of the question is asking what would happen if we were to make the rotational axis line up with the orbital plane. That would essentially mean tilting it so that the Earth's equator would be 90 degrees offset from the ecliptic. One way to do this would be to point the North or South pole directly at the sun, or to point it in the same direction as Earth's orbit. The second part of the question is asking what would happen if the rotation axis was perfectly up and down. This would mean that the equator would not be offset from the ecliptic at all. However, for this part of the question, the Earth's orbit would also be highly eccentric, meaning that our distance to the sun would change a great amount. I won't post the answer here, since this looks like it is probably a homework question, but to find the answer, first read up about what causes the seasons. To talk about the day/night cycle, think about how the Earth's rotation causes day and night, by moving the sun across the sky. If we changed how the Earth was tilted, how would that affect the seasons? How would that affect where the sun appears in the sky? 

The Earth's rotational axis is essentially the line connecting the North and South poles. This axis is slightly tilted, making the Earth's equator 23.5 degrees offset from the orbital plane (the ecliptic). 

a) This is true. Gravitational waves have been predicted by General Relativity since 1916. b) This is true. In February 2016, LIGO announced that they had detected gravitational waves resulting from a merger of two black holes. c) This is true. Two objects orbiting around each other will slowly lose energy due to the production of gravitational waves, causing them to fall inwards towards each other. d) This is false. Newton's laws assume that all interactions happen instantaneously. Gravitational waves and signals from gravity travel at the speed of light. e) This is false because (b) is true. f) This is false. There are two different ways to detect gravitational waves. The first is by using an interferometer, like LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. By using a very large interferometer, scientists can detect minute changes in the length of the arms, due to the passage of a gravitational wave. The second way is by using a Weber bar, a large, solid antenna sensitive to changes in strain due to its resonant frequency. This second method has not yielded any results yet. 

If you want to see a total solar eclipse, you just need to be between the two red lines on that map. As long as you're within there, what we call the "path of totality", you will be able to see a total solar eclipse. If you are outside of the red lines, you will only see a partial solar eclipse. This map shows what percentage of the sun will be covered the further north or south you are of the line. Graham County is entirely within the path of totality, so you should see a total solar eclipse. If you're planning to travel, however, it might be too late. Most campgrounds and hotels within the path are already full. If you're already within the path of totality, my recommendation would be to stay put. Travelling on that day, or even that week, will be difficult. The center of the path of totality will offer the longest viewing for the eclipse. The further from the center, the shorter it will last. The aforementioned map shows timings at different distances from the center. Notice that it also helps to be close longitudinally as well as latitudinally (that may not be a word).
