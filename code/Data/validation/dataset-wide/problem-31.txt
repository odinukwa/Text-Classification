Why not just use the simple solution? Shoot a gun at the sky! I oversimplify, as it's obvious that a regular handgun round won't go into orbital height, but all you need is a device that will shoot large aerodynamic projectiles at a high speed. This would be relatively cheap (quite a bit cheaper than massive laser arrays), and there wouldn't be much they could do about it, short of starting to throw rocks at it. But if you make enough of those installations, in a matter of minutes, at least one will hit the enemy ship hard enough to cause a hull breach. This velocity doesn't have to be very high, especially if an explosive is mounted on the projectile, or just a sharp, durable tip. The only major concern about this is that they may start to bomb out the installations on the ground, but, as mentioned by Jim2B, there's enough clutter on Earth to hide the installations, until the moment of firing. In fact, the entire acceleration mechanism could be kept deep underground, with only a small bit poking out. This would be effectively invisible from space. Furthermore, you have to consider the "rock-paper-scissors" of aerial warfare: Ground anti-aircraft installations beat fighters (usually, or at least are armored enough that fighters can't do much about them) Bombers can reliably destroy ground installations, assuming you have enough so that a few can come close enough that if they are shot down, the explosion of their contents once it hits the ground it is still close enough to assure destruction of the target. Fighters can reliably destroy bombers, as bombers are meant to be anti-facility, not anti-plane, and fighters are designed to be anti-plane. Thus, a small force of fighter jets, even available by today's technology (though it depends how high they are) should be able to make it high enough to attack the "bombers", as fighters CAN make it to orbital height (they just need to get enough speed and then pull up). All you need is one or two fighters to make it within firing range, and then they fire everything they have at the bomber, which probably would be enough to breach the airtight hull. If that fails, ramming the ship at full speed while simultaneously detonating all the on board missiles would almost certainly be enough. 

Pro's: it would be costless to mint new currency. Also, people would be paid for their knowledge and skill, just like in the real world. Cons: Rampant inflation. In just a few hours, someone can earn hundreds of reputation from a smart question. Interesting wrinkle in this problem: What about hive-voters? Say an organization of, say, 10,000 people form up and upvote all of each others questions and answers, they will be insanely rich in a matter of minutes. 

Sorry about the confusing title, it's kind of impossible to condence this into a single one-sentence question. Background information (skip if you already know a little about Divergent and Inception): Divergence: In the book Divergent, people are tested by being injected with a serum that induces fear by triggering certain areas of the brain, causing a "simulation" in which you have to face your worst fear. For example, if you were terrified of enclosed spaces (claustrophobic) you would suddenly find yourself in a tight box that you couldn't break. Some people, the Divergent, can tell when they are in a simulation, and manipulate it(so break out of the box, or make it bigger). Inception: The movie Inception is largely about a technology that allows people to share dreams, and consciously shape them, controlling what happens in the dream and manipulating the setting. The main character of the movie always carries around a token, a unique item that only he knows about to be able to see if he is in reality, his own dream, or somebody else's. How would you know if you were in a simulation created by the serum in Divergent (assuming you couldn't manipulate your surroundings or just 'know'? I ask this because it seems that the idea with the token would NOT work in the question, as your own brain creates the simulation, and therefore you would know about your token and it would be included. 

Because he is all powerful. Consider this: he controls reality. If he controls electricity, he can literally control the thoughts and nerve-firings in someone brain. Thus, he can prevent any thoughts of rebellion from even popping into someone's head. Also, if he only had control of water, because a human is ~70% water, he could literally make his opponents pop like balloons (sorry for the graphic image). In short: history has never faced such absolute power. There is quite literally nothing anyone can do about it. 

How about a "eye-for-eye" justice system? As the idea of justice is fairness, would this not be the ultimate way to guarantee equality? I.E if rob someone, the money is refunded to him plus the amount of money you took, or if you assault somebody, resulting in 2 ribs broken, a broken nose, and minor concussion... bring out the boxers. As imprisoning somebody is, needless to say, a pretty unusual crime (plus unlawful imprisonment is usually done with some alternate intent, whether it be ransom or rape, etc.) In that case, some alternative would be reached, like, perhaps, requiring the perpetrator to pay the family the ransom he demanded, or some ransom determined by a judge. 

Things that would work: Well, you could build a large "cast" out of whatever material is easiest, then pour the concrete in. (By the way, this is assuming that building the cast would be much faster). As for genetic engineering, this might actually be worth the time spent on it. By making your workers humans who are remarkably stupid but require very little sleep and can lift heavy weights (maybe genes from a rhino mixed with the genes of a coffee bean?), progress would be accelerated. Here's an idea: why even build the pyramid? You can dig it out! Depending on the level of tech we're talking about, it could be much faster and easier just to dig a large amount of dirt out. (By the way, I'm making the assumption that you are doing this in a place with decent soil, not sand or liquidy mud. What would NOT work: Hot air balloons to carry up materials. To lift just 1000 pounds, you would need............65,000 cubic feet of hot air! Now, there's already plenty of hot air coming from those aliens, but you would need unfathomable amounts to lift stone, or even concrete, blocks. As for the supervising from the air, that wouldn't really accelerate the pace. As long as your supervisors have good communication and are disciplined, supervision from the air wouldn't change very much. If each section did what they were supposed to do, no problems here. 

The only true benefit for using aluminum is that it is light, but in the case of body armor, that's not necessarily too good of a thing. Of course, this isn't the main purpose of armor, but heavy armor prevents your opponent from knocking you back too much. Most importantly, though, is that aluminum is used because of how easy it is to mold and bend, the exact opposite of what you want for armor. 

Lots of people have already discussed this question, but I want to look at it from a slightly different angle. Why would aliens choose to deploy on the continents? The problem with humans is that we have exactly one target worth defending: Earth. For our purposes, we have no idea about where their home planet is, or how many colonies they have. Our current weaponry is only good for a one or two dimensional attack, the one we face on Earth. On earth, latitude and longitude are the only viable ways of maneuvering. You can't really burrow too deep in the earth, and even if you use planes, in the end, you end up approaching on a 2 dimensional plane. On the other hand, earth is a large, 3 dimensional target. They can just decide to ignore our space defense fortifications, by flying around on a different plane. Earth just doesn't have enough resources or military might to defend from all directions. For that reason, they don't need a ground invasion. They can just approach from the undefended directions, and hold the entire earth "hostage". They send a message to all the major powers, saying that unless they immediately dismantle the defensive facilities in space, they will launch a bombing attack at all the major cities in the world. Earth will have no time to react, as it only takes a few minutes to drop missiles, and a matter of seconds to fire a laser or similar beam weapon. Not nearly enough time to deploy a anti-bomber force of fighters and such. Similarly, if Earth decides to fire ground weapons, such as ICBMs and other very long range weaponry, the aliens will still have several minutes of advance warning, more than enough time to bomb Earth into oblivion, perhaps even enough time to warp back out of range of the missiles. That's not even mentioning the fact that they may have counter-missile systems, and simply shoot down the missiles, or maybe they can jam their navigation systems enough that they can avoid them. In short, there isn't much Earth can do. Earth can either increase their defense of space (which in the current day is non existent, but I'll assume some exists in the scenario) 1000 fold, or they can practice a policy of first-strike and early detection, meaning finding the aliens first, having ships that warp to their home planet, to set up a similar hostage situation, or launching ICBMs the second that any ship signatures are detected, without pausing to negotiate. Even in that case, its possible, that the aliens would still be able to destroy earth. In that case, you would need to set up stations with rail-guns in such a way that any point in space is within a mile or so of a rail-gun.
