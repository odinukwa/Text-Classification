As far as I know, basically by definition, subordinate clauses must be embedded in a matrix clause. Therefore, if sentences of the type "¡Que le vaya bien!" are subordinate, where is the matrix clause? Some have said that such constructions result from the omission of a main verb such as espero (i.e., "¡Espero que le vaya bien!"). Would Spanish speakers interpret the two sentences as equivalent then? On the other hand, if they are not subordinate, what is the function of the subordinator "que"? How should its presence be analyzed? I've looked for similar examples of subordinate clauses being used as complete sentences. The only one that came to mind is "If only . . . !" in English, but the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language says that in this case, it's just that "the apodosis is omitted." It also occurred to me that the "que + subjunctive verb" construction is similar to "would that . . ." in English, but I think it's clear with "would that . . ." that there is indeed a main verb with an omitted subject "I." 

This is a really broad question, but can someone explain the difference between the following phenomena: topicalization, dislocation, shifting, inversion, discontinuity, and scrambling. Wikipedia says scrambling doesn't occur in English, so translated examples from other languages would work. I think I understand very well the phenomena on their own and their definitions and examples of them and so forth, but I want to understand the relationship among them and their categorization. 

No, I don't think so. First of all, babies and toddlers are helpless and receive parenting and caring nearly 24/7. They literally have nothing to do except to passively absorb language. Second, humans are biologically designed to learn language earlier in life, just like geese imprint on their mother extremely early on during a "critical period." Adults can't learn language like babies and toddlers do because it's not supposed to be that way--that unique neurological ability to naturally pick up language is "intentionally" restricted to infancy. I can say "fui a la tienda ayer" to a new adult Spanish learner and act it out however I like--but the learner will absolutely not understand. The way babies associated meaning with words is through literally hundreds or thousands of instances of usage in different contexts and settings and environments. You probably would need, therefore, some kind of intense immersion to learn a second language in your proposed "natural" way, and this is completely unrealistic for most learners. Without total immersion, structured, organized learning is the only option. But the thing is, with babies and toddlers, when they are in their environment of immersion, they literally have no worries or needs that won't be taken care of because they don't fully grasp the language. An American can't go to Spain not knowing how to speak Spanish and then start crying when he needs to use the bathroom, which is what babies do. And I doubt he'll be able to pick up from simply listening and making repeated, frustrated attempts to express himself how to say, "Is there a public restroom nearby?" Therefore, it is necessary to teach such structured phrases and it is impractical to expect natural passive immersive absorption of language of an adult learner of a second language. 

The question points in the future and so I see the problem of having evidence but an educated guess or quotations of linguists would do, I guess. It is no secret any longer, though some nationalist Turks I know, passionate advocates of the Sun Language Theory, see it differently, languages have changed through time. Not quiet randomly, but by rules which historical linguists have discovered. However, times are different know : We ve have Jackie Chan, Star Wars, oppressive governments, prescriptive language advocates, the Kings James Bible, constitutions, TV series and all the things which urges us to speak their way either for entertainment to understand what Yoda said in plain English, for our constitutional rights to know how to read the laws and thus to know how to sit on a leather chair sponsored by welfare money instead the electrical one and all other modern reasons which keep our language in a specific shape like dinosaurs eyewitnessing mosquitoes in amber. So, what is the opinion on this the scientists came up with? 

Is there a field of linguistics which deals with analyzing them and establishing grammatical characteristics for each type of text. Maybe, after a statistical evaluation of text types and comparison with each other one could come up with stable or frequent characteristics for each text type, perhaps differences like: 

I used to start learning a few languages, admittingly my interest ,stamina and brain force didn't last for more than a couple of days each. Nethertheless, I noticed , that the different grammars explained clauses being divided into Subject and Verbs as their minimal requirements. Now, Subject is a sentence part and verb is a part of speach, furthermore other definitions of clauses name Subject and Predicative as the minimal requirements for a clause , which is a blessing feeling of absence of cognitive dissonance since in this case both are sentence parts. But why is it so? 

I understand the field or fields have to be quiet extensive, therefore I don't ask for a description, but rather a list of the names of the linguistic subfields, theories and significant people dealing with it, maybe with short annotations. 

Do you know futher examples of languages with free word order, highly flectional languages like Balto-Slavic, Ancient Greek or Sanskrit or agglutinative languages like Korean and Japanese with a free word order except for the predicate or others that use word order to convey some additional meaning? 

There is an article on Tenseness in Wikipedia, but it is on the Tenseness of vowels, nethertheless it is describing the articulatory way of production well: widened mouth, less open, uplift tongue. How about the Tenseness of consonants, what exactly is happening inside the the mouth and beyond, what is happening in the articulatory system in order to create them? 

According to the definition I read on anaphors, it is an expression, which refers back to a word. As examples what this anaphoras can be I was given a pronoun and adverb: Anaphor realized by a pronoun: 

In korean, consonants are divided into three categories of articulation or coarticulation, one of them is called Tenseness. In korean orthography, tensed consonants are written with a reduplicated consonant sign. In IPA orthography, they are written with a pair of vertical parallel lines at the bottom of the letter:
