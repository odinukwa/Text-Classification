Magic is easier to teach than the available technology (is learning casting a teleportation spell easier than driving a car or flying a plane?) Magic is less expensive to use than the available technology (is Floo Powder easier to make than jet fuel -- and the jet itself?) Magic is religiously (think Amish) or socially acceptable over technology (combustion engines require consumption of fossil fuels, which depletes the earth!) 

Basically, even for viscous materials, heat tends to destroy any bonds between the molecules, allowing them to slide past each other more easily, and making the liquid less viscous. Chemical composition plays a big part too Viscosity can be defined as "resistance in the flow of a liquid." Therefore, materials with molecules that: 

Your concoction is Literal Madness in a bottle In Afghanistan I was routinely awake for days on end, a state achieved by drinking Monster, coffee, and red-bull like it was water. Its been years since I served and my circadian rhythm is still screwed up. Hell, a recent study by the military states that I and my brethren probably have permanent "circadian scarring" from such practices. On top of that, I was once awake for 4 days repelling a major attack from our area of operations. By the time day 3 had ended I and my comrades were actually attempting to open fire at hallucinated phantom enemies, some guys would suffer random outbursts of hysterical screaming. We spent 2 days after sleeping and waking up to eat and not much else, none of us were anywhere near being mentally mission capable for another 2 weeks after that. Caffeine just doesn't work like magic no-sleep juice. When you go more than a few days without sleep by using stimulants you begin causing severe (possibly even permanent) damage to your mind, organs, and nervous system. In any case, you can buy 100% clinically pure powdered caffeine by the pound online that does not posses any appreciable flavor or scent what so ever. You can add as much as you like to whatever you want if you are looking to overdose and induce cardiac arrest and seizures. There is no plausible reason to synthesize a strain of toxic coffee bean to do so. 

Water is not necessary for a planet to have an atmosphere. Planets like Mars have atmospheres without there being water on the planet. (It is worth noting that Mars' atmosphere is about 100x thinner than Earth's, but that is due to its lack of magnetic field rather than any lack of water. In fact, the article just linked states that its thin atmosphere is the reason all the surface water on Mars dried up.) Even if you need a human-breathable atmosphere, there is no need for water vapor. As explained in this answer, the atmospheric pressure and relative amounts of different gasses in the atmosphere will have a much greater effect on an atmosphere's breathability than the presence or absence of water will. As for humans needing drinking water to survive on the planet in the first place, you could have it shipped in from other planets if space travel is available, or have moisture farmers (sort of Luke's aunt and uncle on Tatooine) that mine or gather water from the sparse underground sources you mentioned. 

Psychology isn't actually a hard science I am not obtusivley trying to give you a non-answer, but psychology is not like chemistry or physics where you can pretty much know that if you do A to B then C will reliably and verifiably happen every time. Psychology is a combined product of genetics, parental behavior, childhood environment, culture, and is also subject to interpretation of and the psychological reaction of the evaluating party. There are people who were beaten and horribly abused emotionally every day of their lives who grow up into perfectly functional and well adjusted people, there are kids from wealthy well to do sedate and supportive families who will randomly decide to start shooting meth and mutilating cats at age 25. In psychology we cannot look at any one thing and say "yup, you spanked yer kid too much and laughed at their Halloween costume when they were 5 so now they're going to have a midget fetish." Psychology just cant do that, it can observe trends and try to isolate factors that seem to have a greater influence over certain behaviors, but nobody on this planet can with any certainty tell you how a person is going to psychologically react to anything. A wonderful example of this is experiments in using psychological warfare. The idea was for a device that dispersed a gas that smelled bad enough to chase rioters away without the harsh and violent effects of teargas. It failed because people's idea of what smells bad is not a fixed thing. People from japan found the dead fish formula to smell delicious, people from paupau new guinea were repulsed by the smell of baking bread, people from India only found the scent of raw sewage mildly annoying, etc etc. What the tests ended up confirming was that you cannot predict how everyone will react to anything. So in summary, there is no way to answer your question scientifically. Your character can react to this circumstance however you wish to write them doing so. 

"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic." -Arthur C. Clarke (more info) In other words, you should treat magic like another form of technology. Other answers have tried to argue that using magic over technology precludes the need for both education and research, but in all magic systems I can think of: 

If the people in the alternate reality in question have a basic knowledge of genetics: Females have only X sex chromosomes while males have both an X and a Y. The Y chromosome is inseparably connected to their spirit in a way that X chromosomes never are. Since these are the chromosomes responsible for developing a person's reproductive system, the reproductive contribution of a male is the spirit, where the female's is everything else. If they don't: To be honest, you probably don't even have to explain anything. Just state what happens as you did in the question and that'll be enough of an explanation on its own. 

You Don't You do absolutely nothing. Inmates are dropped off by automated landers and left to fend for themselves. If exportation of harvested resources are important automated landers pick them up or drop off tools and supplies necessary to gathering this resource. Enforce a quota. When quotas aren't met automated landers drop off hunter killer drones with quotas of their own to fulfill. unlike the inmates, the hunter killer drones ALWAYS fill their quotas.... The automated landers do not posses any more fuel or life support than is absolutely the bare minimum necessary to make it to the surface and drop off inmates, cargo dropoff or pickup landers have zero life support what so ever. The Landers don't posses even an ounce of extra fuel beyond what is required to land or boost to an unpowered orbit where they are picked up by a manned ship that comes by to collect the planet's quota every several months. That's a long time to float in space without power, food, or life support. In addition unless specifically dropping off prisoners the landers reenter and blast off at higher G's than can be survived by a living passenger. Any attempt to stow away is suicide. As long as the automated orbital security system is recording quotas are made then the inmates run their own affairs. The planet is given a deadline, if a century of quotas are met and the native born population reaches a certain point of stability, infrastructure development, and lawfulness the planet will be freed and allowed to join the rest of the intergalactic community. If quotas aren't met people die. Carrot and the stick. Someday freedom might be an option, which makes an excellent carrot, and if the population gets tired of chasing the carrot the hunter killer drones provide an excellent stick to beat them back into productivity again. Excellent way to harvest resources and colonize difficult planets with a minimum expense of manpower..... well... not anybody you particularly care about anyhow. 

... and many more. Basically whatever you can think of. But however magic works in your universe, it should be treated as an alternative technology, rather than an alternative to technology. 

tend to have a harder time flowing past each other, and thus are more viscous. Some examples of real-life lava materials, in order of decreasing viscosity (again from this wikipedia page): 

Depending on the tech level of your world, I see a few different solutions being plausible. 1. A lobotomy (as mentioned by A.C.A.C. in the comments) reduces the amount of complexity a person's brain can handle, by simply cutting out a portion of the physical brain. Lobotomies were widely used as a treatment for mental disorders in the 1940s and 50s: 

The concept was further refined at a later date to utilize specially constructed nuclear "shaped charges" known as casaba howitzers. These nuclear devices would have been created in such a way that they focused the blast into a large tungsten slug that would vaporize into a cone, or even beam shaped blast directed at the pusher-plate. It would have made the ship even more efficient with it's thrust and obliterated/irradiated less of the surrounding countryside. 

Platinum: Platinum could theoretically be extracted from the catalytic converters of wrecked cars. Aluminum: Literally everywhere. You could find literal tons of the stuff buried in rubble of cities or in the engine blocks and pistons of car wreckage strung across hundreds of miles of former highways. Copper: There are millions of miles of the stuff in fallen power lines, pipes in wrecked buildings, wiring in wrecked buildings, etc etc. Lead: Car batteries each contain 15 to 20 pounds of the stuff. Iron: a lot of car Engine blocks are made of cast-iron. Why bother with iron when there are literally tons of high grade steel laying everywhere? Tungsten: Could be found in heating elements of heating furnaces, a lot of welding equipment is made out of it, if somebody were to scrounge around former industrial sites and construction sites you could find stuff made out of it laying around. Zinc: approximatley 17% of modern consumer products incorporate die-cast zinc in some form, and tons of it would be laying around in alloyed form in stuff like kitchen faucets or assorted other objects. Tin: Not really used in pure form for much of anything. Its mostly used today for alloying, most main uses for pure tin have been replaced by aluminum alloys. Tin is everywhere but is almost always going to be an ingredient in an alloy. Purest sources would be spools of solder, but that would also be an alloy with antimony and lead. Basic point being, if a large portion of the population died off there would be a ridiculous surplus of pretty much everything laying around waiting to be identified and used. Your specialized scavengers would probably be special more for their ability to identify what alloys where what and what components were made out of what materials than for their ability to gather them. Free resources would simply be scattered from hell to breakfast waiting for somebody to identify their potential uses. Unless its really REALLY dangerous to leave a settlement finding resources would be laughably easy. 

Hotter planets will have less viscous lava This one is pretty self-explanatory, since the hotter the temperature, the less solid almost all materials tend to be. Also, from the Wikipedia page on lava compositions: 

To an ancient Roman, a car is magic. We know how it works, which makes it technology. Any magic, as soon as you know how it works and how to use it, becomes technology rather than magic. If you want to have a people who have rejected one type of technology for "magic" (which is just another technology), there are many reasons to do so: 

Summary If you are looking to make a lava lake that creatures can plausibly swim through, a mixture of super high temperatures and compositions of iron and magnesium will most likely yield the best results.
