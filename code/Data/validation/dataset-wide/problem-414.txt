I see these happening automatically given the wide range of opinions on nearly everything, except the last one. Unless abilities are one-in-a-million and relatively new, they will just be a common part of culture. Heritability would stimulate group associations, and stereotyping would further that, however, the most surefire way to implement associations is most likely geographic ability distribution. Some kind of landmark or location bestows abilities in a small radius around itself, whether it covers a town or a country, leads settlers to gradually become affected by -insert ability here-. The fast way: Take a stock super-power, but then add in a caveat that (usually) blows the helping half out of the water. More examples: Subject can quickly understand anything read, but is plagued with short term memory loss, rendering new knowledge generally useless. Shape-shifting normally causes death in the infant stage as it transforms users into their mental images (including non-sentient ones). Some, usually mentally damaged to impair visualization, can eventually grasp the ability, but the risk still remains. 

Awesome stuff is common knowledge Thousands of earth species are all but unknown to most, but the interesting ones (note subjectivity) are usually recognized. You have probably heard of a porcupine, skunk, lion, rattlesnake, funnel spider and plenty of other dangerous or unique animals, but how many have you actually seen in person. In the same way, knowledge of the strange alien ooglyboogly species will become common due to their unique blinding bioluminescence. The mighty strength of the notafillername is something all remember and fear. Amazing accross the universe Not exactly though. Before the final approach of the target planet, careful research is done (basic audience focusing) regarding what exactly impresses the planet's largest species. Some planets won't even be considered in the circus's route because its culture is such a tough crowd. Now as for humans... Being ourselves humans, we set the tone of "average" to ourselves. Other beings would be so drastically different that some mundane actions of ours are amazing in perspective. Just as monkeys are more naturally athletic than humans, humans may be more dexterous, resilient, or intelligent than most other species. 

So it looks like you have a very dangerous slime bacteria. Unfortunately, the blob's existence would not necessarily lead to mass extinction. Assuming these blobs can starve, they will likely fall into a predator/prey cycle. 

I believe this implies that answers should address how the AI manages internal infrastructure meaning that humans will, at least in the beginning, manage military affairs, international relations, and other matters that directly effect the economy less immediately, as self-sustenance is a future sub-goal. Short term goal Making everyone happy is impossible, but being an AI it will likely try to maximize human happiness, leading to a myriad of secondary goals. 

Specifically, what is the exact principle that allows a rain dance to work, but not magical pumpkins. Certainly rain is more plausible, but unless magic is a sentient being capable of understanding plausibility... 

As the population of prey begins to falter, so does the blob's ability to find food. They then begin to die off and the prey population rises again only to repeat the process. But what if they are apex predators. It is possible that, since they eat organic matter, no digestive system could completely dispose of them. Following the next month or so, the blob eats the eater, quickly teaching all species to steer clear. 

And so many more. But who cares about what they did add to science, we want to know what they can add to science, and there are different criteria measuring that. We want people who... Died before they could release a truly major contribution to the public. Have important knowledge that was lost in the past. (Library of Alexandria, Pompeii, Advanced Art of Memory techniques) Have highly adaptable minds so that they don't freak out when they suddenly pop into existence. Those fitting at least some of these new criteria are. 

I didn't talk about the content of the log book initially because I wanted the focus of the question to be on the physical analysis/dating of the book. However since it has come up once directly and once indirectly in answers; the content of the book will support the true age of the book of roughly 500 years. The log contains the experiences of the time traveler and will have things that appear to initially contradict history but will be shown to be true (like describing an animal that doesn't exist but later is found to have gone extinct). The content is to be used as a hook to investigate if the book is a hoax, but I want the lab tests to be inconclusive. 

Naturally my understanding of building nuclear weapons is minute but I seem to recall reading that one of the harder parts is enriching the fissile materials. Since the fissile materials in a field in North Carolina are present that hurdle is overcome. It seems to me that a determined party could purchase land near the site and tunnel to the fissile materials. After all people were able to tunnel to a depth of over 200 feet on Oak Island so the flooding here should be manageable with enough determination. Assuming: 

Generational Approach Clearly Joe is a government official in Puerto Rico who is a strong advocate for independence. He inspires a large amount of public support for succession from the United States and independence for the island through his impassioned and electrifying speeches. He becomes a thought leader and captures the zeitgeist of the population like the world hasn't seen since Lenin. Unfortunately for Joe, the United States prevents Joe from realizing his dream of an independent Puerto Rico during his lifetime. However a couple generations later when Mexico has recaptured the territory stolen from them through Manifest Destiny, and India is the undisputed world power that strategic marriage between Joe's son and a Brahmin woman with an infant son pays off big. That infant son becomes President of the of a greatly weaken United States, his last act before exiting office in disgrace due to birther revelations and being India's puppet is to endorse Puerto Rico's acceptance into the UN. After acceptance Joe gets a national holiday, and is credited with launching the independence movement in earnest. 

Time is complicated and difficult. Like you said it is best just to hand wave dates if you can. For example you mentioned 1582 as the adoption date but that is very dependent on your story's setting. For example France was 1582, but Prussia was 1610, and England was 1752 (and only had 282 days in 1751 as a consequence). As the English example shows years didn't even turn over at the same time everywhere. If you can't hand wave and have some proficiency programming I suggest you save yourself some hassle and write a simple program to do the conversions for you. If you know Java then the wildly popular Joda Time library is a good fit, and as you can see by the link actually attempts to support this transition. If you prefer .NET then Noda Time is an attempt to bring similarly improved date/time handling to .NET. This still doesn't make everything perfect though because time is hard, and countries in the past and present are able to adjust things by fiat. One example is the "New Years Day" isn't uniformly January 1st under the Julian calendar. So my advice is just try to get things reasonably close to what you want in a way that will make sense to your readers. Don't worry too much about getting it wrong because you're almost certainly are going to get some things wrong. If the natives of the age didn't care enough to have a sensible standard then why should you beat yourself up about minor errors? You can even argue that errors are more realistic since it was easy to make these mistakes during this time period. 

Magical ability can simply be mapped to a square root function. More emotion added does not mean an equal addition in power. Instead, the difficulty in increasing power raises with the power, tapering off eventually. Where this tapering happens is based on whatever you would like to use (different for each person, random, etc). The second limitation is in context. There are multiple types of situations we would prefer aren't magically amped-up, like 5-year old tantrums or adolescent blowups. A number of solutions are possible. Maybe magic increases with age or maturity, it may even be blocked by hormones. :) Alternatively just leave the one rule how it is. Instead of modifying the rule, modify society. Who needs cars when you can get angry and run 80 kph. Even tools are useless to a degree as beating your head against a wall actually might smash the wall. 

Almost all well explored abilities can, with a little creativity, have semi-believable disadvantages just slapped on. Unfortunately, most of the more flamboyant abilities (various kinesis types, shape-shifting), have very powerful advantages and would require even more devastating measures for balance. For most, throwing fireballs is totally worth it for lethargy afterwards. For example: The good: Light telepathy, allowing only for generalized mind reading (like sensing aggravation or lie detection) but nothing as complex as stealing specific thoughts or memories. The bad: Reading someones mind (as described above) takes focus and short range (5-10m) line of sight. Further, all stress, anxiety and likewise conditions of others nearby accumulate on the reader, obviously causing mental instability on most users. 

Companies can adopt a reputation scheme as follows. Near the start-up, companies will strive to produce the best product their resources will allow, squeezing every last ounce of quality into them. Meanwhile, messengers are sent all around the known world spreading news about the "amazing X company" and of course provide accessibility to the products. If the company manages to catch on, their fame will rapidly skyrocket their product quality, but in turn they wont need to even try to improve any further. Companies will gain undefeatable monopolies. 

Wikipedia ballparks earth's total biomass at 560 billion tons C*. If the blobs are able to consume all life, given a rough estimate of bacterial volume/weight (0.6um3/picogram) lands a rough mass at. The volume of the Mediterranean Sea (I am skeptical about this answer and open to revisions) 

This question becomes impossible to answer without knowing many other variables such as the rate of consumption, mean time between food discovery, speed of blob, and specific details about the local ecology. The best bet is to maximize surface area by stretching into a pancake like object for the highest food collection rate. *C stands for organically bound carbon or carbon being used in a living system. 

Genetic control The first matter to deal with is to ask what level of genetic modification is possible. If we are limited by standards slightly more advanced than today's, then we have a few options. We can.. Reduce or remove the production of certain catecholamines, deflating some riot situations. Reduce or remove the production of serotonin, causing memory loss. (What was i angry about?) Modifying the image of a "perfect being." More specifically, giving a genetic bias towards a certain leader figure. Studies have shown that completely irrelevant genetic traits have contributed to public image. So what if the perfect match happens to be the current ship captain. Kind of genetic There is the ability to genetically hamper the supply of insulin to artificially administer diabetes. This could very quickly nip rebellions in the bud if the only insulin supplies are located at secure nodes. In the same way, albeit somewhat less cruel, get everyone on a certain drug and watch as rebellions struggle through withdrawal before crawling back in surrender. (Never mind, just as cruel) Other Rather than using genetics (a recipe for some resistant hero to arrive), use neuroscience. As soon as someone gives birth, transport the newborn to a government approved "educational" site, guaranteed to improve IQ by looks in PR folder 20%. What is actually happening is basic conditioning. While curbing any rebellious thoughts for the next 2-3 years, the young will be fed direct associations between rebellion and pain, and conversely be given compliance and reward. As an added bonus, anyone audacious enough to not put their newborn through this liberating process will have the child labeled as being in possession of a lower intelligence.
