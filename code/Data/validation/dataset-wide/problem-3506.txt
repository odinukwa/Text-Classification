For comparison with mainly agrarian pre-industrial societies, it is possible to derive estimates of X from figures in the Maddison Project Database, which contains estimates of real per capita GDP at various historic dates for various countries. For the UK / England, for example: $$\frac{\text{UK Per capita GDP 2010}}{\text{UK Per capita GDP 1720}}=\frac{23777}{1703}=14$$ For the US and predecessors: $$\frac{\text{US Per capita GDP 2010}}{\text{US Per capita GDP 1720}}=\frac{30491}{900}=34$$ However, such figures should be treated with extreme caution for various reasons: 

In addition to points made in other answers, the costs of transporting goods over long distances can act as a form of protection against imports. How significant they are depends to a considerable extent on the value-to-weight ratio of the goods: the lower the ratio the greater the addition to the total cost of imports. Also relevant is whether the goods are perishable and so require extra costs of preservation (eg refrigeration of meat). The quality of transport infrastructure is also a factor, and improvements may reduce transport costs but will not eliminate them altogether. Thus transport costs are a natural barrier to trade, which can be added to by poor infrastructure in either the exporting or the importing country. As an example, this study by Kiringai (2006) found that transport costs added significantly to the costs of some exports from Kenya (see especially p 12). 

The scenario of counteracting changes in relevant variables is theoretically possible, but unlikely in practice. As an example that might come fairly close, consider the supply curve of oil in a small developing country which imports all its oil and subsidizes its sale, the subsidy being at a flat rate per unit. The country will be a price taker for oil, so its domestic supply curve will be horizontal at the world price less the subsidy. Now suppose the world price falls, and the government takes the opportunity to reduce the subsidy by a similar amount. Either change on its own would shift the supply curve (the former down, the latter up), but together they could largely counteract each other. Even in this case, however, it is implausible that the supply curve would never shift at all. For one thing, the world price of oil is constantly changing, and it would be impracticable to adjust the subsidy so frequently. For another, there would inevitably be time-lags in adjustments. So although you correctly identify a theoretical exception to the statement by Mankiw, it is unlikely to be of much practical significance. 

As explained in Starfall's answer, question 1 raises the issue of how growth in real GDP should be measured when, as a consequence of exploiting the gains from trade, the composition of the country's output is changing; hence in that context it may be helpful to focus on the effects of trade and specialisation not on growth but on welfare. The answer to question 2 is that the country will not necessarily be better placed to achieve growth via capital accumulation and technical progress. Consider Ricardo's example in which (c 1800) England has a comparative advantage in cloth and Portugal a comparative advantage in wine. I make no claim here to historical accuracy, but consider a scenario in which, facilitated by trade, England specialised in cloth and Portugal in wine. In static terms, such specialisation could benefit both countries: England could import wine more cheaply than it could produce it itself, and similarly for Portugal and cloth. But what would be likely to happen then? The production of cloth would offer plenty of scope for cost reductions through investment in labour-saving machinery, enabling England to achieve growth. The opportunities for cost reductions in the production of wine would probably be more limited (mechanical grape-harvesting being well beyond the technological possibilities of the time). So although both countries could benefit from trade in static terms, the dynamic effects on subsequent growth would probably be quite different. It is even possible that, if Portugal were to abandon cloth production in order to specialise in wine, it would in the long run be worse off than if it had maintained cloth production and thus an opportunity to benefit from investment to reduce costs. Whatever may be said about this particular example, the general point is that some goods offer more scope than others for cost reductions (and quality improvements) through investment and technical progress. Specialisation in the former is likely to facilitate growth, while specialisation in the latter may not do so. Addendum. Have now found the source where I first encountered this argument: Robinson (1974) Reflections on the Theory of International Trade p 6. 

That he has no evidence of living standards in 100,000 BC, but relies on an assumption that living standards at that time were the same as those of modern foragers (p 951). That he draws inferences about diet (a key aspect of living standards) from male heights (from skeletons) but ignores evidence from female heights and from other skeletal features, which some have claimed to support different conclusions (p 952). That his argument that humans of 100,000 BC had more leisure time (another aspect of living standards) because of their forager life-style is not supported by skeletal evidence comparing (more recent) foragers and agriculturalists (p 955). 

There is no reason why Ralph's indifference curves should be parabolic or symmetrical about 12 noon. Their shape will depend on his preferences and circumstances (or, more precisely, on his preferences which will be influenced by his circumstances and may therefore change from one day to another). Suppose for example that it's a working day and his boss has asked him to attend a meeting at 1 pm. In that case his indifference curves on that day would probably become almost vertical at some time before 1 pm. 

The concepts of short-run and long-run equilibria certainly feature in microeconomics. Indeed, they have done so for over a century: see Marshall's Principles of Economics (1890). 

So far as the "when" is concerned, Google Ngram can be helpful for this sort of question. It suggests (see here) that use of the term was nil or close to nil until 1960, since when its use has grown fairly steadily. 

If you simply want to estimate the values of Y corresponding to particular values of X, you can calculate the regression to obtain estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, and need not be concerned with hypothesis testing. If you want to test one or more hypotheses, then the choice of hypotheses should be driven by the purpose of your research. A common aim is to assess the relevance of an independent variable by testing the hypothesis that its parameter equals zero, but that is just one choice. In this case you might want to test the hypothesis that $\beta_1=0$, and you can do so without testing any hypothesis about $\beta_0$. Where matters possibly become confusing is that regression software often, by default, generates t-values for all the independent variables and the constant. If you want to test the hypotheses that $\beta_0=0$ or $\beta_1=0$, these t-values are useful. But you can also ignore them if you are not interested in testing those hypotheses. The estimated parameters don't depend on these hypotheses or t-values, so you can still use them in estimating values of Y. 

The aggregation of this sort of situation over many households can explain the coexistence of poverty and saving on a significant scale. 

I would raise two issues about the dataset to which the regression line was fitted: The range of prices in the dataset. If the datapoints all lie within a very narrow range of prices, then even small variation (whether real or due to measurement error) in the associated quantities can lead to a low coefficient of determination $R^2$. In terms of the formula: $$R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{Residual sum of squares}}{\text{Total sum of squares}}$$ a narrow range of prices tends to result in little of the total sum of squares being explained and most of it being residual, resulting in a low $R^2$. Note that it is assumed here that the regression takes price as the independent variable and quantity as the dependent variable. The number of datapoints. If the number is small, then, even within its range of prices, the dataset may happen to be unrepresentative of the distribution of points within the population of interest. This can result in the squared residuals calculated from the dataset being on average either much smaller or much larger than is representative of the population. Thus it is possible that $R^2$ has been correctly calculated from data which is not representative of the population. 

The diagram is fine as an illustration of a possible relation between the long run average cost curve and one particular short run average cost curve. Long run in the context of a firm's cost functions means that all inputs are free to vary, so it makes sense to refer to the long run cost curve. Short run means that one or more inputs (eg capital equipment) are fixed. Since these inputs could be fixed at different levels, there are many different short run cost curves. The long run cost curve is the envelope of these curves. Unless it has been specified at what level they are considered fixed (which could implicitly be whatever is their current level), it makes no sense to refer to the short run average cost curve. In most cases, the minimum point of a short run cost curve will be above the long run cost curve. This should not be surprising: it just means that, for the relevant output, it's possible to obtain lower costs if all inputs are free to vary than if only some are free to vary. There will however be one short run cost curve corresponding to the levels of fixed inputs at which the long run cost curve is at its minimum. The lowest point of that particular short run cost curve will be tangent to the long run cost curve (and incidentally the short and long run marginal cost curves will also pass through the same point). A diagram showing multiple short run average cost curves, with one having its lowest point tangent to the lowest point of the long run cost curve may be found in Nicholson W (9th edn 2005) Microeconomic Theory. For an online source see here. 

In an open economy, the balance of payments current account equals net saving. This is often represented as: $$S - I = X - M$$ where $S$ is saving, $I$ is investment, $X$ is exports and $M$ is imports. That is admittedly a slight over-simplification as current account includes not only exports and imports of goods and services but also other items such as income from foreign investments or employment abroad, and foreign aid. For many countries, however, the net amount of these other items is relatively small so that the balance on trade in goods and services approximates fairly closely to net saving. This appears to diverge from common sense since, if a country has a trade deficit, most non-economists looking for explanations will consider possibilities such as: 

A useful framework for analysing personal activities involving both monetary and time costs is a household production model. A simple example of such a model (adapted from Chiappori & Lewbel (2015) pp 411-2) is below. Note that a "household" could be one person (the assumption that members of a multi-person household cooperate to maximise their joint utility can be regarded as an optional extra of the model). The model distinguishes between commodities, which directly affect utility, and goods, which affect utility only indirectly. The taxi ride, for example, would be a good, not a commodity, because it is just a means of getting from A to B. A household is assumed to maximise utility which is a function of commodities: $$max\quad U(Z_1,\dots,Z_m)$$ For each commodity there is a production function: $$Z_i=f_i(\mathbf{x}_i,T_i)$$ Here $\mathbf{x}$ is a vector of goods and $T$ is time taken by a household member in producing the commodity using the goods. Production here should be understood broadly: it would include, for example, using a combination of public transport and time to "produce" a journey from A to B. Leisure activities such as visiting an entertainment can also be produced in this sense. The goods used in producing $Z_i$ can be bought at prices $\mathbf{p}_i$, and income can be earned, over any chosen time period, at a wage $w$ (this is a simplification, eg because working hours are often fixed by an employer). Considering a period of, say, a week (and simplifying again by ignoring saving and storage of goods between weeks), the monetary constraint is ($T_w$ is time worked): $$\Sigma_{i=1}^m \mathbf{p}_i\mathbf{x}_i\leq wT_w$$ The time constraint is ($T_{tot}$ is total time available): $$T_w + \Sigma_{i=1}^m T_i \leq T_{tot}$$ The two constraints can be combined (by substituting for $T_w$) as: $$\Sigma_{i=1}^m \mathbf{p}_i\mathbf{x}_i \leq w[T_{tot} - \Sigma_{i=1}^m T_i]$$ This formalises the trade-off between money and time: more time used as an input to commodities means less time available for wage-earning work and so less income with which to purchase goods inputs to commodities. One way to bring personal energy and motivation within the model would be via the value assigned to $T_{tot}$. Starting from 168 hours in a week, deductions might be made for sleeping time, quiet relaxation, etc to arrive at what might be termed effective time available for activities, with smaller deductions for a more energetic and motivated person. 

The data underpinning GDP only began to be routinely collected in the mid 20th century following the work of Kuznets. Earlier figures, however carefully researched, are inevitably estimates and unlikely to be very accurate. Even if accurately measured, GDP is subject to many well-known limitations as a measure of welfare (see for example here). One limitation which is perhaps especially significant when making comparisons over long periods of time is the exclusion of unpaid household work. Ordinary people in the 18th century, living rurally as most of them did, are unlikely to have had either the opportunities or the means that people have today to pay for others to do their cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. Many countries have changed in size and area. It isn't clear, for example, whether the US figures for 1720 relate to the whole of the current area of the US (and so include the economies of Native Americans), or whether they just include the regions then settled by Europeans. A further pitfall would be to interpret these figures as estimates of growth in productivity arising from improved technology and capital accumulation. Even the low living standards of the 18th century were achieved with much lower population densities than today, implying on average much more land suitable for agriculture per person. So it can be argued that the figures under-estimate productivity growth. 

Two relevant economic principles are: Economies of scale: These are a more significant issue for middle and especially high schools which have a greater need for specialist teachers, as others have pointed out, and also for specialist facilities such as science labs with supporting technicians. Such teachers and facilities would tend to be under-utilised in small schools, resulting in higher costs of provision per child. Elementary schools, on the other hand, rely more on generalist teachers so can operate efficiently on a smaller scale. Travel costs: Older children are more likely to make their own way to school, while younger children are more likely to be accompanied by a parent. Hence the costs of travel to school, for a given journey, and including not only fares and/or fuel costs (if any) but also and especially the opportunity cost of a parent's time, tend to be greater for younger children. While these costs do not impact directly on a school's budget, they are likely (for state schools) to add to political pressure to provide or keep open smaller elementary schools serving a small neighbourhood. 

The government would need to run businesses in which it has the potential for a sustainable competitive advantage, giving it the opportunity of earning profits on an ongoing basis. That might be based on a natural resource endowment (cf Saudi Arabia and oil) or on a technology which others are, for whatever reason, unable to copy. For most countries, such opportunities are limited. The government would need to run the businesses efficiently, so as to realise those profits. This would be challenging due to: a) political necessities conflicting with efficiency; b) rent-seeking behaviour by managers and workers in the businesses. The profits realised would need to be sufficient to fund the government's expenditure. For a typical developed country with high government expenditure on education, health, welfare, defence, etc., this would require improbably large profits. To give an idea of scale, UK government spending in 2015/16 was £772 billion. By contrast, the world all-time largest corporate earnings (Vodafone in 2014) were less than 10% of that at £59 billion. 

Within the approach of New Institutional Economics associated with Oliver Williamson and others, emphasis is placed on transaction costs as a key factor in explaining why different forms of economic organisation arise in different circumstances. Transaction costs have been defined, eg here, as including search and information costs, bargaining and decision costs, and policing and enforcement costs. Question: Suppose I go to a supermarket that I know well, buy branded packaged goods of kinds that I have bought many times before, and transport the goods home. Should the cost of my travel to the supermarket and transporting the goods home, in this situation in which any elements of search, information gathering, etc are minimal, be regarded as a transaction cost?
