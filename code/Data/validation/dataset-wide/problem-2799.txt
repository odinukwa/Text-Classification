I believe its a deeply philosophical question, one that concerning Theology and the other concerning the philosophy of science : the ability for the process of scientific inquiry to yield accurate predictions, once a suitable theory is proposed and proven. Theological issues involve mainly relationship between extraterestrial life and God: do they have souls and related questions. But the relationship between the philosophy of science and extraterrestrial life is even more interesting: we assume the laws of physics are the same througout the universe. What about the laws of biology? The current problem seems to be that there has been no known theory of the evolution of life, but at the same time such a theory is the holy grail of evolutionary biology. Assuming then such a theory will one day exist, one will be able to predict the evolution of life in the same way Newton and Kepler helped us predict the orbit of planets with enough precision to land space probes on Mars for example. Once the mechanism is known, then it becomes easier to predict the outcome of life on other worlds the same way we can predict the existence of volcanoes and dust storms given the chemical composition of the atmosphere of other planets and the physics of climate modelling. There is, I believe, a great fear associated with the existence of a few bacteria outside of this Earth, and this fear is amenable to study by another science, the science of psychology. An interesting article here adresses this question: 

The first prerequisite is to break cause-effect cycle. True randomness alone, can satisfy that one, but not the second. Check the ideas of Roger Penrose on the matter -- he considers the possibility that the process of decision making works on quantum level. 

The answer is because people are social beings, and caring is sharing. People get invested in holidays and sports because it's a way to share experiences, and fulfill their social needs. 

It only seems that way - the experiences would be positive and desirable only in a short term. Once they have passed, we would experience negative emotions caused by the knowledge that these experiences were fake. I think, that negative outcome is inevitable, because of the tip of Maslow's pyramid. Once you have the basics covered, you will need self-actualization. You can fake all other levels, but you cannot fake your self-evaluation. (Self-actualization requires self-evaluation.) Knowing that you indulge in pleasure, while you could be improving your self-worth, is not a positive experience. Then there might be individuals that self-evaluate so low, that they don't believe in themselves. Those are the ones that may embrace the fake reality, and probably be better off this way. 

"made up stuff" - in a sense, all stuff is "made up" :) What do you mean by "manufacture emotions" - these are still emotions. Even more, they are shared emotions. I get the notion that you want to ask: 

At the heart of the problem of evil is the idea that God lets evil things happen, such as wars, and does nothing to stop them. So we are at odds with God as to what is good and what is evil. It can be argued that we do not have the knowledge or the foresight or the omnipotence to make such a judgement. It also could turn out that (for the sake of argument) we are fooled into thinking God is good simply when we experience his all encompassing love and feel good about ourselves. Have there been any theologians or philosophers in the history who have adressed these issues in this way? 

I believe that Theists are reluctant to agree that everything that happens is God's will, with the knowledge and consent of God, even planned in advance. This reluctance seems to stem from the reason that this will make all the evil things in this world (according to our estimation of what is good and evil) all seem that they were planned and orchestrated by God Himself, making God the creator of evil. The problem of good and evil is adressed by other answers on this site, however I am still no sure what the reason for the objection among theists for the belief I have stated in the question. Perhaps because it leads to fatalism? One possible answer is that everything is God's will, and God, is like a surgeon, permitting pain to warn us of a serious disease within our souls, performing painful operations to rid us of the disease of wickedness within us, and getting us ready for a pain free, blissful afterlife? This is one possibility but I have not seen this opinion clearly articulated anywhere yet. If this is the answer, then we can preserve the concept of God's goodness as well as the idea that everything that happens is according to a Divine plan. 

As wiki definition, cognition is a group of mental processes that includes attention, memory, producing and understanding language, learning, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. Here we can group it to three... 

I am a novice and amateur in the field of philosophy. And my answer may not be supported by facts. These are only my personal views. Ultimate Perfection: Its “limbo” from which due to some sort of entropy “The Beginning “ or the “Mother Big Bang” happened and the universe got its birth including “The Space” (Space is often considered pre-existing , but I differ on it). And limbo is mother of all sciences. And existing laws of science could vary when subjected to continuous changing dimensions of time, space and other new or varying physical factors. Actual Perfection: In material world if a matter obeys the rule of universe and act accordingly, it is deemed to be perfect. For e.g. in atomic world the sub particles behaves in a pertained manner as it has to unless it is subjected to external pressures. So in material world we can conclude everything is perfect but can be subjected to change. This theory can be challenged by quantum mechanics and uncertainty principle but I believe the uncertainty principle may be due to external uncertainty or continuous micro level change it the outside environment of the isolated atoms. Relative Perfection: This form is of mental world. Here some want apples to be oranges and others want oranges to be apples depending on their need, demand and comfort. Perfection is more of innate quality. And by applying some pressure on the matter we try to satisfy our need. So mental perfection is a perception of perfection. Degree of Perfection: As a friend above gave an example with screw, If the screw was a made of perfection the how difficult it would be to fix it but the screw needs 0.3 mm tolerance to be a perfect one. But if satisfies the customers need in satisfactory manner, it is perfect for him 

I think the prior answers miss the point and focus on the term "happiness" instead on the question whether "well-being" could be used as basis for comparing ethical choices. I believe that this is how we make daily choices - we optimize our future well-being in alternative futures. However we cannot use such technique for resolving ethical choices, because personal well-being may contradict the ethical implications. We should also factor in our inefficiency of predicting and correctly evaluating the future. 

I believed that some census based on literacy may be a good thing, but now I understand it's not. The main reason for the change in my perspective was the observation, that a lot of people that would qualify as literate, are not making an effort to engage in any kind of socio-political activity. They don't participate in elections on national, or local scale, or even on community level. Those people can be effective citizens and make educated decisions about what policy is better, but they choose not to. The proper approach would be, not to restrict the voters that are unable to make educated decisions, but to incentify the ones who are educated and simply ignore politics. If they are educated they should be aware that if they do not vote, someone else would do it instead of them. A friend put it like this: "Suddenly I realized that participation in political life is no less important than my health." I agree with him, and we should strive to make people realize that. I believe that placing a literacy census would cause more of the literate people not to vote, as they will trust that any of their peers would suffice to ensure the proper policy.
