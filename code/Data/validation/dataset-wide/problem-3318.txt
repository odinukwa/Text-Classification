[1]: Since there have been a few questions on what I mean by co-evolution of words and stress, here is my rationale: Words can be thought to evolve, e.g. a common precursor *ph₂tḗr evolved into Latin pater, Sanskrit पितृ ‎(pitṛ) and Germanic *fadēr; the first further evolved into French père and Spanish/Italian padre while the last further evolved into German Vater, English father, Icelandic faðir and others. For a series of phonologically related words, the evolution is typically similar, as with ÜIE *p- that evolved into Germanic *f-. I can imagine stress following a similar set of evolutionary rules, e.g. to invent an example the stress of a two-syllable word ending in -er moving from the second to the first syllable. Co-evolution would assume that the stress evolution was influenced by a phonological evolution (e.g. the final -er syllable being reduced to shwa) and vice-versa in some way. 

After the historic overview, let’s focus on understanding and intellegibility. It is true that Dutch nowadays is only mutually intellegible to Germans who live very close to the border, and even they will not understand Dutch people from the far West. Contrary to that, even though they have different standards, a Swiss from the very southern corners of German-speaking Switzerland, an Austrian from the very South-East of Austria and a German from the northernmost point of Germany will understand each other if they use their respective standard variants (Swiss standard German, Austrian standard German and German standard German) — even though these standard variants will still have some local colouring. Thus, the distinction between Dutch and German as two languages makes sense while distinguishing between the other three makes less sense. Sometimes, even though well within the dialect continuum, the understanding of nearby local dialects can be very difficult even for locals. The Lech river in western Bavaria is one such example: the Bavarian dialects spoken East of it and the Swabian dialects (in the Allgäu variant) spoken West of it are very different and hard to understand for those from the other side. 

I tried to add it as a comment, but I couldn't so I post it here. I think there is a misunderstanding between free word order and scrambling languages. Free word order languages are those that do not have any order. It is a property of non-configurational languages. (Of course there is a big discussion whether these languages really non- configurational and whether they really do not have any order, but at least it looks like this). Warlperi is one of these languages. On other hand Turkish is not a free order language, its neutral order is SVO. It is a scrambling language. It may scramble objects and adjuncts to a higher position for topic, focus and etc. (there are some other scramblings as well) however, there are restriction on scrambling in Turkish. Not all possible word order combinations are grammatical in Turkish. That's why it is not free word order language, it is a scrambling language. 

Try to use idioms. If we assume that idioms start as a one constituents, they may show underlined wordorder. you can also look at more unmarked word order. 

Since your stated goal is to compare someone's actual pronunciation with some standard pronunciation, you should use square brackets, to indicate that you are talking about actually pronounced sounds. It does not matter whether the level of detail is narrow or broad; square brackets are for phones, slash brackets are for phonemes. If you use slash brackets, you are asserting that what you write is a phonemic representation of speech, which should represent all (and only) the sounds that you believe to be contrastive sound categories in the talker's or listener's mental representation of the language (phonemes are abstract constructs, and are never spoken or heard). To use your example, if you write then you are asserting that the vowels in the second and third words are identical in the speaker's mental representation. That may or may not be the case; e.g., they could be different phonemes that have a partially overlapping distribution for this speaker, such that in this particular sentence they came out sounding very similar to you. Or, they could be totally non-overlapping distributions, but each of their sounds happens to overlap with different parts of your distribution for the phoneme you represent as , so you classify them as the same sound, even though the speaker thinks they are producing two different sounds. 

unergatives have both vP projection and VP which consists of just the verb unaccusatives have just VP projection. They do not have vP projection Transitive verbs have vP and VP which consists of V and Object 

Kazakh was written in Perso-Arabic before it wasincluded into USSR. All countries in USSR used cyrilic alphabet, thus, Kazakh languages at that period was written in Cyrilic. After gaining independence, Kazak government decided to convert their writing into Latin. Now, it is in the period of transition to Latin. 

There is a suffix in Kyrgyz and I am not sure whether it denotes future tense or imperfective aspect. Are there any tests which can help me to distinguish between imperfective aspect and future tense? 

There are two kinds of NPs existential and definite. Sometimes NP that we would expect to be existential behave as they are actually definite. One example of such NPs are those that are kind-denoting. ex: The snake is a cold blood animal. The rose is a flower. These sentences have general meaning and we would expect them to have existential meaning and take indefinite article. However, they take definite article and have definite meaning. Could any one give examples of relative clauses that have kind-denoting meaning and are definite or is there any articles on this topic? Thank you. 

The SIL keyboards that you linked to are indeed the best of breed. Like any input method for typing outside of ASCII, it takes an investment of time to learn the keystroke sequences, but in my opinion it is far more efficient than websites with soft keyboards when you need to enter a lot of IPA. I have used them on both Linux and Windows. To the operating system, it looks like any other IME for entering Chinese characters, Devanagari script, etc., so you access it through the "language bar" on Windows and corresponding language-switcher-type interfaces on other platforms. On Linux at least, there are a few applications where the keyboard doesn't work (e.g., Atom text editor; I think the problem is with Atom and not the IPA keyboard but I haven't tried to debug the issue). If you just want a better web-based soft keyboard, I think Richard Ishida's is amazing, others I work with prefer Weston Ruter's because it resembles the official IPA chart. There is also an Android app though it is described as a "proof of concept" and I haven't personally tested it very thoroughly. 

If you arecomming from the non-linguistics environment, the best book is to start with Is Fromkin, Introduction to language. It provides a general introduction to syntax, morphology, phonology, semantics, pragmatics and brain and language. It is easy to read. I really advise you to start with it. For syntax, you can read Andrew Carney's Syntax: a generative introduction. Hageman's introduction to government and binding. Redford's Minimalist syntax. I have benefited from these books a lot and i advice you to read them in this order. For phonology, you should read Oddey's Introducing phonology. Good luck 

According to formal sementics propositions (semantic term for "sentences", "clauses") have truth value. The truth value shows whether sentence is true or false and it is denoted as 1 or 0. What about sentences that have failed in presupposition? Do they have truth value? Ex: The king of USA lives in NY. Here, the interlocutor presupposes that the USA is ruled by the king, and s/he fails in his/her presupposition. So what be the truth value of this proposition? I think that it is impossible for proposition that has failed in presupposition to have a truth value but I am not sure. Note: here I am talking about the direct meaning of the word "king", not possible metaphoric.
