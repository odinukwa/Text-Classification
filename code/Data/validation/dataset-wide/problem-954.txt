Crystal settling - various mineral have differing melting/solidifying temperatures, allowing for a process of distillation where magma can gradually be made more felsic (from basalt-like to rhyolite-like) Inclusion of country rock (aka assimilation) - where crustal material is incorporated and melted into the magma Partial melting - where only the part of the rock material is melted 

Based on the Theis equation, increasing the transmissivity will increase the radius of influence and decrease the total drawdown. Drawdown is directly proportional to the pumping rate and inversely proportional to aquifer transmissivity and storativity. $$s = \frac{Q}{4T\pi}\int_u^\infty \frac{e^{-y}}y dy$$ and $$u = \frac{r^{2}s}{4Tt}$$ Where s is drawdown, r is radius from well, t is time, T is transmissivity, Q is pumping rate, and u is the well function. Applying this equation, you can produce plots like this: for these plots, I used Q = 500, S = 0.01, and t = 4 

To add to a already complete answer by kwinkunks, perhaps one of the most surprising things about plate tectonics to geophysicists was the fact that in some cases extension in the lithosphere (rifting) is a direct cause of subduction zones. When the idea of subduction zones was finally formalized (~1969) most geophysicists expected all subduction zones to be accompanied by an area of compression, but what is later found is that rifting centers opened up nearby. What studies further found is that the motion of the upper plate and the viscous coupling of the subducting plate caused the trench to roll backwards in the opposite direction of subudciton! This trench rollback opens ups an oceanic ridge, what we call back-arc spreading centers! So the whole point of this small digression is that plate tectonics is a very complex issue, and not all the forces are well understood. Models show that the mantle is convecting near plate margins at orders of magnitude greater than plate motion. Inside the mantle wedge of subduction zones we see rapid and complex mantle flows that react to plate geometry in unpredictable ways. Melting (lava/magama) certainly plays a apart in our plate motions, but we really have no idea how much it does. To be honest, if we did, a lot of geophysicists would be looking to do something else. 

Based on the dimensions you provided and the photograph, the density is likely between 5 and 9 g/cm3, assuming cylindrical volume with height between 2.8-3 inches and radius between 0.4-0.5 inches. Based on this density and the weak magnetic properties, you have an iron-rich rock. Most fossils are comprised of calcite or a mineral with a similar density of around 3 g/cm3, with the exception of cases where metallic minerals replace the original material. The location provided is useful. However, I could not find a Cressy River, and I assume you are referring to the Merced River. This area flanks mountains that are rich in gold placer deposits and associated minerals, including iron. It is most probable that you found a iron-bearing mineral associated with the igneous or metamorphic rocks in the mountains.

The full question is: Is it possible that the recent, successive, long droughts from Australia to the West Coast of both American continents are signs of epic crust failure? The question is aimed specifically at the possible link between droughts at those specific areas and the weakening/loosening of lateral stress between tectonic plates. The reasoning is based on the following observations: 

The crust is not rooted in the mantle, and is cut in numerous crustal plates. Tectonic plates are held in place like an arch, so the gravity and lateral stress and friction are the main forces holding them up. Mantle flow provides uneven support to continental plates and is actually the main destabilizing force according to current theories. Based on the idea above, if humans dig up too much underground materials around the fault lines, the edges of the fault lines are weakened: there is less material to keep up adequate lateral stress. Then, the soil around the softer/weaker side of the fault will deform and be compacted, or fail and result in earthquake. Deformation/compaction and fault failure do happen naturally too, but humans may have extracted too much underground resources for the natural healing process to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. It is known that the fault of the West Coast is lacking stress and the soil is deformed in the Amos et al. (2014) study. If this keeps up, the arch structure of the crust will crumble down catastrophically, and in chain reaction too. And it doesn't take "much" edge weakening to fail an arch. 

will give you a scatter plot with Lat being the x, Lon being the y, and rain being the z. Also note that because your vectors are different legnths, you cannot plot them. You must have vectors of the same lenght to plot (each point must correspond to another point on the axis). Other types of plots will require you to interpolate between the data points. If you want to plot it like in the comment below: pcolor is your best choice. Say your Lat/Lon vectors have n points. Then to make an nxn grid, you can use the command 

Crystal settling and partial melting follow the Bowen's reaction series (pictured), which tells you which minerals melt at which temperatures. This is essentially the same process of distillation of alcohol by separating it from water, which has a lower temperature of vaporization. Each of these processes allows for a unique rock chemistry, even within the same batholith. While we categorize magmas into different groups based on their geochemistry, we must keep in mind that the geochemistry of any igneous rock falls along a sliding (not discrete) scale (i.e. not every granite is the same). Otherwise igneous petrology would be really easy. See the wikipedia article on igneous differentiation for more information. 

In summary, humans have dug up resources around active fault lines of the Pacific for more than a century. The weakened soil/plate edges lead to excessive geothermal energy affecting the surface. So yeah, in the end, is it possible that the recent droughts are signs of epic crust failure? Please kindly point out if my observation/logic makes sense and/or may correspond with reality. 

The scenario may correspond with the Pacific plates. There are numerous oil, and water extracting operations all around the Pacific. After decades of intensive and continuous resource extractions, it may be showing terminal signs of the natural healing process failing to catch up with the rate of weakening at the edges. First, there are quite a few very strong earthquakes concentrated in the last ten years ($URL$ This alone may be trivial since the Pacific Ring of Fire is well known to churn out earthquakes. However, combined with the recent persistent droughts of Australia, Chile, US (especially California), and this year, Canada, the situation may be really concerning. Droughts alone can be caused by weather patterns. Climate change can cause it too, but it is a global factor, as opposed to more localized factor such as weather patterns. However, I think that underground processes can also cause drought. Aquifers can store a lot of heat, so the lack of underground water means that the geothermal energy will dissipate into the surrounding soil, basically slowly baking it. Less water also means that the soil is more prone to compression. Compression, especially continuous, even if it's slow, also generates heat. Oil reservoirs are also similar, but since oil is more reactive to heat by transforming into gas, and continuously extracted by humans, their pore pressure varies more. The presence of oil reservoirs around the fault lines may serve as springs. By extracting oil/gas, humans lessen the expansion force of those liquid and gas and reduce the pore pressure, which stabilizes the fault line. But in the long term, as is the case now, the reality is that there will be not enough oil to provide adequate pore pressure/lateral stress/counter-compression force. This may be the cause of the recent frequent strong earthquakes; the plates are loosening. Eventually, all the edges of the Pacific ring will all fail in an epic catastrophe, as the arch structure of the crust crumbles. Also, by removing oil, it liberates more space for gas to form. Gas is more compressible and heated by compression; it is another source geothermal heat. It is like a bike air pump/air suspension system. The idea is that the excess of geothermal energy causes surface water to dry out faster. Another possibility is that the fault line of the West American continent is already caving in and is dipping deeper/entering into more contact with the mantle. The mantle is a way stronger source of heat, and without adequate of underground heat absorbers, the surface soil becomes baked. I think that it's also the cause of the Blob ($URL$ The heat of the soil is escaping into the ocean, forming the Blob. Combined with El Nino, it worsens the drought. 

Based on the brassy color, it's metallic luster, and it's resistance to breakage, I would say it's pyrite. Try to scratch glass with it (be careful not to break the glass). If it scratches, it is likely pyrite. If a nail can't scratch it, it is likely pyrite. You could test it's streak by rubbing it on a piece of hard unglazed ceramic. If it leaves a black mark (maybe with a hint of green), then it is likely pyrite. $URL$ Edit: Based on a approximate volume of 458 mL (that of the Monster), which is 458 cm3, and the density of pyrite of 5 gm/cm3, then sample should weigh about 2.3 kg (5 lbs). Galena (see wienein comment below), a less brassy and less hard (easier to scratch) metallic mineral, has a higher density of 7.6 gm/cm3, which would give is a mass of 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs), closer to what you are showing in the picture. Galena has a light grey streak and contains lead. 

Yes. Earthquakes are Dangerous No. Because big earthquakes happen so infrequently (~300 years in Seattle's case) that one shouldn't really worry about it. Engineers design buildings to withstand large earthquakes. Of course there is the possibility of failure, but generally the US is very good about their infrastructure. Seattle is not like Oklahoma, where they are completely unprepared for earthquakes. I lived in Los Angeles in 18 years, and while my time there was during the Northridge 1994 earthquake, most of the damage was to the buildings (which were insured) and not to the people. Still there is some risk, but I think the risk of driving in Seattle is probably riskier than living in Seattle for 50 years of earthquakes. 

I have seen several graphs showing the prehistoric temperatures and CO2 concentrations derived from ice-core data. My understanding is that CO2 and temperature correlate. I assume that Milankovich Cycles are what caused the variations observed in temperature in the ice record, but what specifically caused the CO2 to fluctuate? 

Because of variations in temperature, depth of emplacement, thickness of the crust, heterogeneity in the mantle, and variations in the magma distillation process, each volcano has a unique geochemical signature. However, volcanoes in similar tectonic settings have similar geochemistry. Geochemistry of magma starts out as ultramafic when sourced from the mantle. However, the mantle is not entirely homogeneous, which is evident from the presence of hot spots and other thermal and gravitational variations. Ultramafic magma rising from the solid mantle can be generated by decompression (thinning of the crust) or by the introduction of a contaminant (water from subducting plates). Once the mantle melt reaches the base of the crust, it's geochemistry can change via three different processes:
