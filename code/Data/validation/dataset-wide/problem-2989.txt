How to assure that a logical conclusion is correct? A logical conclusion is correct if and only if it adheres to the rules of logical reasoning. These rules are named valid syllogisms. One finds the table of all valid syllogism in textbooks on classical logic. Valid syllogism determine how a conclusion follows from two premiss. E.g. Premiss 1 = "All rectangles have four equal angles", premiss 2: "All squares are rectangles", Conclusion = "All squares have four equal angles". This syllogism is named "modus barbara". Hence a method to assure correct proofs is 

@Boris You are right to put in question the reasoning of the book you refer to: 1) To support a thesis with the weakness of human reasoning power ("it is impossible for man to fathom ...") is no argument. There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy. (Shakespeare: Hamlet 1.5) 2) We lack any example of an object which exists without beginning in time. Big Bang would be a candidate because it is said that Big Bang created spacetime. Unfortunately Big Bang is not part of the cosmological standard model but only a limit point of it. Aside. I agree with Mauro that "eternal" is not synonymous with "having no beginning". But I consider this point not relevant for the reasoning about the question. 

According to Plato, ideas are conceived only by intellectual intuition. Typical Platonic ideas are the beautiful, the true, the good, the just. Ideas strongly affect the objects of the perceptual world: An object is beautiful because it participates at the idea of the beautiful - according to Plato. The clearest exposition of the ascent from the world of perceptual objects, i.e. our every-day world, to the realm of Platonic forms is described in Diotima's speech in Symposion, notably 210ff. In plain words, it is the process of continous abstraction. The first harsh critique and rejection of the Platonic theory of Forms is due to Aristotle: Metaphysics, 990b ff. Aristotle started as a student of Plato at the Academy in Athens. 

The question refers to ontology. The classification matter or mind is a strong simplification. Popper advocated a tripartition with 

The Ethics by Baruch Spinoza is a paradigm of a philosophical treatment which employs a mathematical approach. Spinoza advances “more geometrico” stating definitions, axioms and proving propositions. What’s your rating of his work? You illustrate your point with three “definitions”. Are you sure that the author of the definitions “idea” and “mental representation” has a background in the philosophy of mind? If not, this could be the origin of the problem. I agree with you that philosophy lacks rigorous definitions. But who is to be blamed for? To which degree must the fault be ascribed to the philosophers and to which degree to the subject of philosophy itself? For mathematics it is a plain sailing with rigorous definitions, axioms and propositions. Because mathematics is free to invent its concepts. In addition, the complexity of mathematical affairs is by orders of magnitude less than the complexity of philosophical topics. My examples of philosophers with a good mixture of rigor and content are, e.g., Immanuel Kant as well as the representatives of critical rationalism and the representatives of evolutionary epistemology. 

It's the aim of physics not of mathematics to find out how nature works. Physicists design theories to explain the phenomena in certain domains of nature. There are mechanics, electrodynamics, solid body physics, quantum mechanics etc. These models are expressed in a mathematical language. Now mathematics can solve certain equations from these models and derive results which translate back into observable physical predictions. The base is the physical model, not the mathematics. Nevertheless it is a big question why the language of mathematics fits at describing nature, see the famous essay by Eugene Wigner $URL$ One possible, but a bit speculative explanation would be that our world is a mathematical simulation. This possibility has been brought up in the last time. But it has been criticized, because a digital simulation would imply that we observe anomalies due to the rounding errors of the digital computers used in simulation. For the whole issue see Chap. 10. Universes, Computers, and Mathematical Reality in Greene, Brian: The Hidden Reality. Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos(2011). 

ad 2: We do not have mental pictures in the sense of a copy of external objects. Instead we construct experience according to organizing rules. These rules are the categories, see B102ff "On the Pure Concepts of the Understanding or Categories" from Critique of Pure Reason. 

Infinity is not just like generating natural numbers step by step. If you take all real numbers, they are infinite, but you cannot count them like the natural numbers. The real numbers form a second kind of infinity, which is bigger than countable infinity. But as indicated by Conifold and Mozibur Ullah, thanks to Cantor you can go on to construct arbitrary bigger infinities. Counting natural numbers - even by a computer - will never come to an end, because no biggest natural number exists. Space can be infinite like the set of all real numbers, just imagine a plane infinitely extended into all directions. If space is finite you cannot necessarily go to the edge: Imagine 2-two dimensional beings living on the surface of a ball - like us living on the surface of the earth. The surface is finite, but because these beings do not sense the 3rd dimension, they do not register any boundary of the surface. Similarly it is possible that we do not register a boundary of a 3-dimensional finite space. It is still an open question, whether space is finite or infinite. Expanding space can be tested according to the General Theory of Relativity by measuring the expanding distance of galaxies. The galaxies do not expand, but their distance from each other expands. Anyhow, you do not need to go the "edge" of space. Saying "to infinity, and beyond!" seems a manner of speaking without any literal meaning. 

According to Plato Zeus establishes his two sons Rhadamanthys and Aiakos as judge. All cases where one of them was uncertain how to decide, should be judged by his third son Minos instead. Plato does not give any explanation why Rhadamanthys is responsible for the souls from Asia while Aiakos is responsible for those from Europe. Hence the most simple explanation is to consider it a kind of division of labour to master the crowd of souls. Aiakos is born at the island of Aegina near Athens, hence he is from Europe. While Rhadamanthys is the son of Europe, a phoenician princess. Hence he is from Asia. But it is not explicated in the text whether their origin bears any relation to their tasks. Rather one can suppose that taking into account this relation would contradict against the neutrality of their job. 

I do not see a difference between utility and extrinsic value. In particular your example concerning the extrinsic value of money shows, that money is useful to obtain a certain goal. You ask 

The argument has the structure "A => B" with "A = genes and Rule L" and "B = phenotype shows ratio 3:1". The experiments validates proposition B. But it would be a failure to conclude A. You only assumed that condition A is sufficient for B, but not necessary for B. Hence B could be explained by a different, possibly even unknown condition C. 

Your question recalls the arrow paradox of Zenon, see $URL$ The paradox shows that one cannot argue with infinite sets analogous to finite sets. The correct method to deal with the paradox is calculus. Accordingly one has to integrate the velocity at each each point of time to obtain the distance covered by the arrow 

Hume uses the term perception as generic term covering both impression and idea. Hume identifies three properties of ideas inducing the mind to link simple ideas to associations, namely 

Semantically "Nothing" is not a noun but a shorthand to negate the existence of a certain object. In the context of the quote it translates into "There is no version of you, where you go on reading this book or where you throw out the book." The discrimination between possible, real and necessary, e.g., in modal logic, is useful. The concept of a possible object or of a possible situation is at least a thought or an idea. And one can discuss whether the idea in question is logically consistent: A unicorn is a consistent idea while a square circle is not. Hence to sum up and to answer the headline of your question: It is not correct to describe genuine possibilities as 'pure nothing'. 

Moral obligations are rules established in a given society. They are established either explicitly (e.g., 10 commandments) or implicitly by convention. I do not consider moral obligations laws like laws of nature, which hold without exception. Nor do I consider moral rules alike to juridical laws with an imposed sanction when broken. From a philosophical view point, moral rules are the subject of ethics. Here Hume's principle holds: One cannot derive an "ought" from an "is". However, the state of moral laws is much-debated.

Apparently the coherence definition is a relative definition, it defines "true relative to a set of proposition or better relative to an accepted theory." One recognizes at once that the propositions, which a solipsist or a person in a state of psychosis accepts, satisfy the coherence definition of truth. But according to his fellow companions they do not satisfy the correspondence definition. On the other hand, most people try to state propositions which satisfy both types of truth definition. Hence concerning many propositions many people consider compatible both types of definition.
