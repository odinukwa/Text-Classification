The hypervisors have 5 VMs in the cluster basically running as a RDS setup. The setup is pretty new. There are 4 1GB network cards in each hypervisor using nic teaming to make one 4GB connection for the VM usage / iscsi hosting of the VMS. In the past week both servers at one time or another have dropped out of the cluster and gone offline, the cluster resumes on the other server but I would really like to know why it's going offline. What happens is it just doesn't seem to be able to connect to the network in any way, the network settings are there but it cant' ping anything (internal or external), it can't tracert, can't see any other device on the network. I've tried disabling and re-enabling the nic team and the virtual Ethernet device but it doesn't come back online, the only way I can get the network restarted is to reboot the server. But i can't for the life of me work out why it's happening 

I'm setting up a new citrix box and trying to set a 20gb area to hold ISOs for the VMS. I'm trying to setup a new lvm area to hold it, but i'm getting an 

I'm upgrading our network from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010 and it's going swimmingly. Well it was, I've moved some users to the 2010 box with blackberries (iphones working fine) and I can't get it working with BIS (blackberry internet services) Whatever settings I try I get a 

We've got a new install of Exchange 2010 with an existing 2003 install on the network that we're trying to phase out. It was working fine but something has happened and some of our outlook users can connect (I think they may have had cache mode on, i'm not sure, but they're working) This is the setup: 

If your .pem file has lines that say and then your key is in that combined .pem file and that is just fine. 

blocks (possibly with plain text above each block showing what certificate the block contains). If you split each of those blocks into its own file so you end up with and you should be able to run on each of them to get their respective certificate subject lines. Assuming that has a subject line of you should then be able to run and that should, hopefully, connect without giving you the self-signed certificate error. 

The other possibility, in general, is that individual verification checks can be disable on a per-file or per-directory level in the spec file itself. So, while not true in this case, it is entirely possible that a packager could disable MD5 sum checking for files that are known to change for one reason or another. 

You need to close the url.rewrite with a . That fcgi error seems to be referring to an fcgi script that I don't see mentioned in your configuration snippet. Is that the whole config? Is there anything in the conf.enabled directory? 

Installing an extra root certificate on the server is not going to help a browser trust the server certificate the server sends it. The browser needs the root certificate locally in order to construct the chain of trust when the server sends it the certificate. If you check the certificate dialogs in Chrome and Firefox I believe you will discover that Chrome has found the root CA installed locally and has constructed a correct valid chain whereas firefox has failed to do the same (because it does not have the necessary root CA locally). Installing root CA certificates in browsers is a fairly simple process once you have the appropriate certificate file. The certificate dialogs in the various browsers all have an 'import' button of some sort that you can use for this task. If your certificate requires intermediate certificates then those should, for best compatibility and correctness, be sent by the server during the SSL handshake process. That requires the intermediate certificates to be configured on the server the same way as the server certificate is (that is they must exist in a file and Apache must be pointed at that file with the SSLCertificateChainFile (or similar) directive). 

I'm trying to setup my Freenas server with Active Directory, it's connected fine and the following works: 

But when I setup a ZFS Dataset and try and setup the permissions to be one of our local active directory groups, no AD groups or users are in the dropdowns. On top of this I seem to be getting this spammed a lot in the messages so I assume they might be linked: 

error. I'm using $URL$ url, which works fine and the authentication settings I'm trying (username / password) work fine in owa. Close to the point of pulling my hair out on this issue, is there a way to find out what it's failing on? Have I missed something very simple? Tom 

I've got an RDS setup being worked on at the moment, however now it's all setup I'm trying to RDP to one of the servers, theres the following 

We have two physical servers that we want to turn in to virtual hosts. I've been looking at the VMware vSphere 5 Essentials Kit for 3 hosts (Max 2 processors per host) and 192 GB vRAM entitlement + Subscription for 1 year for around $500. This I think seems best for what we want; 

Want to set it up using windows failover clustering. However my question is I'm going to have 6 VMs running in the cluster and will be splitting loads evenly between the two. Am I right in thinking each VM will need it's own iscsi LUN on the network storage. If they're all on the same LUN they wont be able to move VMs around one at a time? 

All the mailboxes have been moved from Development01 to Exchange01 and are receiving emails and OWA works fine and iphone etc can all connect. However Outlook can no longer connect theres no errors just says that the exchange server is not online. I tried deleting the mailbox and re-adding it and it doesn't resolve the mailbox user / name with Exchange01 as the server name. However weirdly if i set the server to resolve as Development01 it resolves the mailbox name and then changes it to say Exchange01, but then still says exchange server is offline. I've tried so many forum posts / things like checking if encrypted connections to exchange. I've also tried using http to connect to exchange and no luck. Any help or tips really will be appreciated as I've got 30 users who can't connect to exchange and arent too happy! EDIT: I've added a video of what happens when you try to connect $URL$ Tom 

If you are already using yum to install your packages then the RPMs already exist and you could just grab the RPMs you want and store them locally for later use... or you could get a bit fancier and actually set up a local repository with your desired packages (or even the entire distribution) and use that for your servers (though if you go this route you need to be careful about getting security updates and the like if these are things that need a reasonable security status). 

I would suggest that you simplify your life tremendously and avoid going down this route any farther and instead see about finding a package for the 6.2 version and either using that directly (if possible) or building a package from the source package for it. If all else fails you should be able to take the current (5.9) source package and replace the version bits (and possibly patches) and try to build a package from it with the version you want (6.2). Using a package (yours or someone else's that are built correctly) will avoid the large amounts of pain you will inevitably encounter trying to do this all from source when you aren't comfortable with this stuff. 

If you configure apache with no listening configuration on port 80 and ensure that you configure it to listen on port 443 with ssl correctly then yes, your server will not listen on any non-ssl ports. 

You need to find out if you are supposed to have an intermediate certificate or not. If you are then having your server supply it in the chain will help any clients that do not have it build a valid chain (assuming they have the StartSSL root certificate installed locally). That may not be the case and that will not help people who don't already have the StartSSL root certificate trusted locally. You can't help those people though they will have to install it to avoid the warning. 

Hypervisor 02 - Windows server datacentre 2012 Nothing running yet (I wish to add this to the hypervisor 01 active directory to use hyper v's built in replication options. i believe it requires the use of AD to keep everything in sync nicely. What do you guys recommend? Tom 

We have two dedicated servers across two different sites. They host hyper v virtual machines for email hosting etc. I'd like to have hyper v do replication between them and so I have a copy elsewhere, if something goes wrong re-route traffic to the other server (that side of it, i.e. the ip re route is all setup) However, the problem is how do I get the active directories talking to each other. Site to site vpn is out of the question I belive as I cannot add hardware either side to do the connection. I'm not sure software VPN will suffice here? The setup: Hypervisor 01 - Windows server datacentre 2012 

Is this the correct version of vmware to run? The choice is pretty overwhelming to say the least! Tom 

We've got a bit of a situation where an Exchange 2000 system was migrated to 2010 and all was fine. That was a few months ago and the 2000 server was retired. Some bright sparks just realised the public folders were never transfered across. So I've booted up the 2000 server and I can't access any of the public folder (although the folders are displayed) 

Got an odd situation I can't work out. HP Hypervisor running windows 2012r2 recently has started freezing the VMS. There are 4VMs on the hypervisor (all windows 2012r2). About once a week it seems the VMS all become unresponsive. They show as online in hyperv and the hypervisor stays responsive, however you can't get on the VMs using remote desktop OR connecting through hyperv manager. I can't see anything in the system/application event viewer that could point me in the right direction and i'm a bit stumped. Latest windows updates and drivers installed as far as I can tell. I need a bit of input on how to debug this 

Entry capitalization matters in the ifcfg-eth* files. Those files are read into a shell script context and looked up by known name and is not the same variable as . 

Assuming you mean then yes, that should work. Check that the file has exactly two lines and that there aren't any extra spaces or anything in the key line for the second key. Also check that you have added the correct lines for each desired key. 

The following hackery should work with 1.11.* client and server versions of cvs. I imagine it will work with others but those are the versions I have locally to test with. 

This appears to be something that the javascript on the google page is doing. I don't see it in firefox with noscript enabled and stop seeing it in Chrome on Windows if I disable javascript. I don't know what specifically as I haven't dug any deeper than that. 

Yes and no. You are correct (barring some additional details) for server certificates. However the certificates in /etc/ssl/certs are intermediate and root CA certificates and not server certificates. That is they aren't used for server identification directly. As such they don't have that matching concern. Server certificates, the ones that servers actually present to the client, do have the matching concern and are what you see in the first certificate you get when you connect. If you look at the other certificates in the chain openssl builds (and spits out to you) you will see references to the /etc/ssl/certs style of certificates. The CN itself may not match if one of the alternate fields defined as being legal matches matches instead. Among the methods for adding additional valid names for certificate matching is the use of a subjectAltName extension with the dNSName type which then specifies what the valid name to match against is (at least for HTTPS purposes). There are others for other purposes as well.
