Domestically, you start at the club level and work your way through the ranks. That's not different from any other sport, really. Details will vary by country, of course. ICC full members nominate umpires to the International Panel of ICC Umpires, which stands mainly in ODIs. The best umpires are invited by the ICC to the Elite Panel, which stands mainly in Tests. So once you are the best umpire in your country, chances are you'll be asked to umpire international matches. 

There is no maximum number of overs allowed to be bowled in a Test match. The extent of play is determined by time. On the last day, the provisions for the "last hour" apply. At least 15 overs need to be bowled after the last hour has started. If a team is short of victory when the time is up and the 15 overs have been bowled, the match is a draw. 

It would be hard to make a real analysis of this, because the landmark Bosman and Kolpak rulings affected everyone at the same time, so you cannot compare how things would have developed this way or that way. But many years later, I think it's clear that it did not matter much. The relative strength of national teams in Europe is still about the same as it was 20 or even 40 years ago, and it still has about the same variance over the years and between major tournaments. So I think the concern that the influx of foreign players into national leagues would harm the respective national teams did not come true. What has become clearer because of this is that the development of talented players and teams begins much earlier at the youth levels. Many national and club teams have realized this or were forced to realize this in one way or another. 

In tennis, Hawk-Eye is used to locate the impact of the ball on the flat ground relative to the field markings. The analog of that in cricket is locating the point where the ball pitched relative to the lines of the stumps. Those decisions are almost always uncontroversial, and the Test Match playing conditions specify that on this matter "evidence provided by technology should be regarded as definitive". (Notice that there is no "Umpire's Call" verdict on the point of pitching.) The controversial aspects of Hawk-Eye in cricket are locating the point of impact and determining whether the ball would have hit the stumps. Those are much more difficult problems, both conceptually and technologically. 

There is the argument that because football is very physical on the players, having the season much longer is not reasonable. That's part of the reason. They could obviously work around this by playing less often but over a longer period of time, but that would confuse the schedule (which is a strength they have over other sports). Or they could sign more players, which would increase costs, but television revenue and ticket sales are good, so the problem might rather be that there aren't that many more good players available. They can't start the season much earlier. The NFL relies heavily on integrating college drafts into the teams, and the college players aren't going to be fully available until they have concluded their studies around April. Many NFL teams have in the past shared stadiums with baseball teams (not so much anymore), and so adding more games before October would create scheduling difficulties. And television networks don't want to show high-value programming during the slow summer months. They can't end the season much later. First of all, you don't want to move the Super Bowl from its established location. Also, football is traditionally an outdoor sport that's at home in the north, and the weather dictates that you shouldn't play too many games between January and March. They do play the occasional playoff game in the snow, but you don't want that every week. Then, in February, you have the Winter Olympic Games to contend with every four years, and in March baseball season gets slowly going. So all things considered, the current setup is the sweet spot that works for the sport and the league. They could probably expand it, but only a bit without diluting the product. 

and similar sports (e.g., cross-country skiing) because the importance of drag and/or pacemaking (rabbits) causes the participants to react to each others' moves, as opposed to just individually running as fast as they can, as in short distance running. Each of these can be done in teams, not only as relays (more common in running, skiing), but also with all participants going at the same time (as is typical in cycling). Bicycle racing is a bit of a special case, because only one individual wins. But they have teams, and the team's goal is to have one of their guys win, so it's almost the same thing. Biathlon used to have team races where all four individuals from a team went at the same time, but the teams did not all start at the same time but were timed separately. Speed skating has a team race, but the teams are at the opposite ends of the track, so they do not interact. Short-track speed skating has relays, so the team does not cooperate within itself. There might not be a crystal-clear example of what you are looking for. But you could plausibly organize one, like a street race (marathon, say) for teams. Looking at those lists and thinking about it, I think the reasons why there aren't many clear examples of sports involving more than two teams playing against each other are mainly practical. First, there are reasons of geometry. Normally, opposing players and teams will face each other. If you have more than two parties, you are very limited in what you can do. Second, there are reasons of safety. Most sports in this category involve balls, because that's how players play off each other, and if you have balls flying at high speeds in all directions, it could become dangerous. Also, player contact will be dangerous if it is likely that more than one player can touch, tackle, or hit you. The best way to do this, then, is with sports that are slow, turn-based, and work well with a flexible or circular player arrangement. The racing examples fit this as well, because the movement of the participants relative to each other is usually slow, safe, and flexible. Or you escape from geometry and safety constraints by using computers. 

You can look up the D/L regulations and tables published by the ICC. It only talks about balls remaining and wickets in hand as resources. So free hits are not considered. In order to model an end-of-game scenario like that accurately, you could arguably also want to consider who is on strike, who is bowling, whether you have any DRS reviews left, and so on. That is clearly not feasible. 

Regarding your first subquestion, why is this not done in association football: The governing bodies are very much concerned that the game is played at all levels according to the same rules. Local club football would obviously not be able to use any kind of video review, and therefore the way players and officials approach the game at different levels would be different. For example, referees might be more or less likely to give certain decisions if they could review them on video, and players might play certain kinds of tackles more or less if they knew that video review could exonerate them. It is also a concern that this would create more interruptions, but I think that is secondary. Then, could an individual league do this anyway? Well, a league can do whatever it wants, really, as long as they comply with certain basics, like sporting codes and anti-doping regulations. They don't have to follow the official rules 100%. Major League Soccer, for example, has experimented with numerous rule changes. Or a league could play the whole game indoor on a smaller field, which of course many in fact do. But if FIFA or UEFA, say, feel strongly about this, and I think they do, they could sanction anyone who tries by saying, for example, only teams that play without video review can participate in the World Cup or the Champions League. That would probably convince everyone. There are many quite benign regulations like that, in fact. For example, you need to play on natural grass if you want to try to participate in the World Cup. 

It is ultimately a naming convention for convenience. There are by nature more right-handers, both bowlers and batsmen, so it makes some sense that the default, most compact terminology -- offspinner and legspinner -- is made relative to that combination. Also, there are more finger spinners than wrist spinners (by nature?), so it makes some sense that among left armers the default, most compact terminology is assigned to the finger spinners. Also, arguably, bowling left-arm wrist spin is less likely to be successful as a career, because it's harder to do than finger spinning, and you're effectively bowling offspin to the mostly right-handed batsmen, which is less difficult to deal with than legspin. So as a result of this being on average the least natural way to bowl and possibly the least effective, left-arm wrist spinners are so rare at the top level that they get the most obscure term. If you want to use a methodical and neutral terminology, you can refer to any traditional spin bowler as right/left-arm finger/wrist spin, but try saying that all day long. And nowadays, with the rise of "mystery spinners", this categorization is starting to break down, and you will see bowlers listed as "leg break/googly" or some such. (A similar asymmetry exists in baseball, where left-handers are referred to as "southpaws", but there is no common special term for right-handers.)
