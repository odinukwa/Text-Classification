Henry Bessemer's Bessemer converter is generally understood to be the technology that created the concept of industrial-scale steelmaking, but what constitutes "industrial-scale"? The Wikipedia page says that a Bessemer converter could process batches of 5 to 30 tons at a time, and that one stage of the process lasts 20 minutes, but that's as far as the information goes. If I was a steelsmith in the 1860s with a single Bessemer converter (original model) and access to an unlimited amount of raw materials, how much steel could I make each day at a sustainable pace? 

A slave had a status as property, but was also a human being. What "other property" was being considered? The article doesn't appear to say anything specific regarding discussion of any other forms of property. The only thing I can think of that would make this statement make sense would be a really ugly, dehumanizing question designed to argue against counting any representation for slaves, along the lines of "well if you can consider that Southern plantation owner's property for the purposes of representation, then why not consider the assets of my bank in New York?" What was the "other property" that was discussed at the Constitutional Convention? 

The first two points are historical fact, and the last two are obviously correct, but I'm not so sure about the reasoning that connects them. That's what I'm wondering about: was the fighting in Europe building up to an inevitable stalemate before the USA joined in and tipped the scales? And if so, how likely is it that the political leaders of the nations involved would have been willing to recognize it as such and end the war under less devastating conditions than what actually happened? 

The Atlantic actually did an article about this very question (and various other, related topics) back in 2002, titled 1491. It notes some very interesting points, including that we do have actual records of death rates, from Spanish missionaries who settled in the area: 

In addition to the excellent arguments of @user995689, I think it would be difficult to imagine that granting eternal life to someone would be perceived as a punishment. Mummification gives the soul access to eternity; that is not punishment. Is there any record of this "punishment" prior to hollywood? Any record of this punishment from any source that has a legitimate background in Egyptology? 

I passed the question to the professional historians at Mt Vernon (Washington's home). The Mt. Vernon research historian provided the following information, which I'll quote. 

Surprisingly difficult to find a good image to illustrate this. I think the description in Wikipedia is as clear as any I've read: 

There can be a bubble in anything - from tulip bulbs to beanie babies to real estate to stocks. So there is probably a bubble going on right now in something. A bubble is defined as a surge in prices unrelated to the fundamentals of value. But there is no objective standard of value. Recently money moved from equities to gold and bitcoin because of rumors of conflict with North Korea. Was that surge of value in bitcoin justified by the fundamentals of bitcoin? Or was the surge unrelated to the conflict, and the surge was actually caused by rising trust in the stability of bitcoin after it avoided the worst effects of the bitcoin fork? What is the true value of bitcoin and what portion of the surge was reasonable and what portion was unreasonable. For commodities that are studied widely, it is possible to achieve a consensus estimate on when the bubble starts and ends - this is not an objective estimate, but a consensus that from point X to point Y there was a bubble. We can generally point to the end of a bubble because they tend to end in a crash. But it is difficult to point to the beginning. Unreasonable valuation always begins from reasonable valuation. People buy a commodity because they feel it is undervalued; as the value rises it crosses the value estimation of various buyers, until there are fewer buyers than sellers. 

Alexander crossed the Gedrosian desert, with the main body of his army. The fleet you have in mind is the fleet raised by Nearchus to explore the Persian Gulf. According to Arrian (Anabasis, Book 6), the fleet sailed from the city of Patala, somewhere at the head of the Indus delta. 

Matters are even more complicated with the remains of four bodies that were found in Anemospilia. The building's design is unusually symmetrical and its function can't be deduced with certainty, although most authors call it a temple. Part of the uncertainty comes from the fact that it was partially destroyed by an earthquake and/or a fire in the 17th century BC and part from its unique - for the era - design. To make matters worst, Yannis Sakellarakis, who first excavated the area in 1979, didn't publish a report of his excavation. Sakellarakis theorized that the one body, a young adult male, was the victim of human sacrifice and the other three bodies were the priests that were conducting the ritual, killed by the earthquake, in what could only be described as an extremely bizarre occurence of events. The young adult male was found on top of what appears to be an altar, with a knife resting on top of him, and Sakellarakis believed that the ritual was a panicked attempt to satisfy the gods as the seismic activity was getting stronger. The following is a picture of the remains of the alleged victim as it was found: 

Wikipedia has a pretty comprehensive list of the names used for the Ottoman Empire at different periods and in various languages. At the end of the article there's also a chronological list of links to historic maps using the alternative names of the Ottoman Empire. Since you are mostly interested in diplomacy and official writing, I also looked for a few notable international or bilateral pacts and treaties. The period of the Ottoman Empire I'm mostly familiar with is during and after the Greek War of Independence, so I focused my search on documents after 1821. Nevertheless, I think my findings sufficiently show that a variety of names was used, sometimes even within the same document. "Turkey" and "Ottoman Empire" were the terms more commonly used. London Protocol (1830) and Treaty of Constantinople (1832) In the original French version of the London Protocol that established Greece as an independent kingdom, "l’Empire Ottoman", "Porte Ottomane" and "Porte" are used. In the English version of the Treaty of Constantinople that marked the end of the Greek War of Independence, "Turkey", "Turkish", "Ottoman Sublime Porte", "the Sublime Porte" and "Ottomans" are used. Pact of Halepa (1878) I couldn't locate the original text of the Pact of Halepa, but I've found two mentions in near-contemporary newspapers that show a variety of names was used. The first one, from the July 16, 1896 issue of The Mercury (Australia), uses "Porte" when referring to the Ottoman government, and "Turks", "Moslem members", "Mussulman members" and "Mahometans" for the Ottoman people. The second mention is from the May 29, 1903 issue of the Star, the evening edition of the Lyttelton Times (New Zealand). It uses "Turkey", "Turkish" and "Mohammedans". Treaty of London (1913) and Athens Peace Convention (1913) The Treaty of London and the peace treaty signed in the Athens convention concluded the First Balkan War. Both documents use "Ottoman Empire". In a note the Great Powers send to Greece on February 13, 1914 concerning violations of the Treaty of London, "Turquie" is used instead. Treaties of Sèvres (1920) and Lausanne (1923) In the English version of the Treaty of Sèvres the Ottoman Empire is referred to as "Turkey", and the Ottoman government as "Imperial Ottoman Government" (preamble) and as "Turkish Government" (article 250). I couldn't locate the French (primary) or the Italian version of the treaty, nevertheless the English one is also an official one. The Treaty of Lausanne was signed after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, however it's perhaps worth noting that there are various instances of "Ottoman" in it. Sources 

Daniel Drezner in his course Foundations of Economic Prosperity suggests that human history can be portrayed as a hockey stick; almost all the progress in human history has occurred since the industrial revolution. 

I was deeply suspicious of this simplistic view, but research quickly shows that it isn't completely absurd. In general, the Tories are the King's party and could be expected to support the King's position (which at the time was believed to be that England should return to Catholicism.) The Whigs offered less support to the crown. (the notion of an opposition party and a loyal opposition would not emerge for 100 years or more). That's the simple view. Truth was, as it always is, more complex. 

I don't think this is a supportable assertion. Let us assume that prior to the black death land was fully utilized (that is to say the cost of bringing another unit of land under cultivation/production would cost more than it was worth.) After the black death, 1/3 of the population is dead. The simplistic assumption is that the population will continue to cultivate 2/3 of the land and everything will continue as before. Reality is a bit more complex. 

From 1290 to roughly 1655 it was probably illegal to marry someone who was Jewish. But that's only because it was illegal to be Jewish. That is a special case answer to the question, mostly because I was looking for an example that didn't involve Roman Catholics. 

I found that source after consulting Kevin Stroud, a lawyer, historian, and creator of the (excellent) History of English podcast who admitted that this was not his particular area of expertise, but suggested that: 

I'm going to embrace your assumption that by "use" of the forum, we're referring to political discussion. (people doubtless "used" the forum for whatever function they found appropriate at the time). Others may challenge this assumption; I have no doubt that the Roman Forum was used for a variety of religious and public functions even when it was no longer connected with the governance of the Republic/Empire. I suspect that there are two fundamental shifts that reduce the importance of the Roman forum. The first shift was probably the crisis of the third century. Governance of the Empire declined, and at one point the army auctioned off the office of Emperor. I have no doubt that politics was discussed in the forum and the Senate during this period, but the point of the crisis was that governance was not extended throughout the Empire in any meaningful fashion. I think the second and more significant shift away from the political use of the forum was when Diocletian decided that Rome needed to be taught that it was no longer relevant to the governance of the Republic. 

It's the same statue, the armour is removable. The statue is today kept at the Museo Nacional Del Prado: 

Genocide is one of the hypotheses brought forth for the extinction of the Neanderthals, 30.000 years ago. An early example of gendercide from recorded history is the destruction of Melos by the Athenians in 416 BC, during the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, in Book 5 of his History of the Peloponnesian War gives a detailed account of the negotiations between the Melians and the Athenians that ends with the gendercide, after the negotiations broke down: 

Johannes of Palermo was a scholar in Frederick II's court. Frederick was aware of Fibonacci's work, and perhaps even an admirer. In 1225 when Frederick's court met in Pisa, Fibonacci was invited to demonstrate his works. I can't find a source for when exactly Johannes of Palermo posed his problems, but the two men certainly met in Pisa and Johannes posed his problems directly at Fibonacci: 

Dennis Hughes is particularly doubtful of the claims made by Sakellarakis. In Human Sacrifice in Ancient Greece, he argues that the knife found on top of the body is actually a spearhead and that it could have easily dropped on top of the body from, for example, a shelf during the earthquake (pages 16-17). He is less critical of Warren's interpretations, and even presents some arguments in favour of Warren's interpretation for the childrens' bones found in Knossos (page 22). Which brings us to Kydonia. The remains are 12 bones belonging to the same young - possibly adult - woman and were found in the courtyard of the palace, surrounded by animal bones. In the following picture the human remains are visible to the right and the horns of a Cretan Ibex are visible to the left: 

The Medical Management of Biological Casualties Handbook of the USAMRIID has a short chapter on the history of biological warfare, also identifying the Hittite Plague as the earlier example: 

The 1997-2006 flag (your third flag) is the first flag (1960-1963) of independent Congo, then known as Congo-Léopoldville. While it's true that it's design is reminiscent of the Belgian Congo flag, I imagine the symbolism of being the first flag of independent Congo was a major factor in choosing it over any other design. The 1963-1971 design (your first flag) was adopted when a seventh province was created. The six stars at the left represented the first six provinces of the new state, and the Congolese decided they didn't want to add a new star every time they created a province. Interestingly, the 1963-1971 flag was also used from 1997 to 2006, as the presidential flag. From 2006 and onwards it's the official flag of the country, replacing the 1960-1963 / 1997-2006 design.
