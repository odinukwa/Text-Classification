It's the cardinality of the preimage of a generic point, because generically the local degree of a complex analytic function is always +1. If the rational function is $a(x)/b(x)$, then the number of solutions in $x$ to $a(x)/b(x) = y$ for generic $y$ is $\max(\deg a,\deg b)$. 

In the comments, the poster asks whether the intersection is always a polytope. However, Anton Petrunin's example disproves that possibility. If you take the three measures to be proportional to $1$, $1+(\cos x)$, and $1+(\sin x)$ on $[0,2\pi]$, then the set of non-negative linear combinations is indeed a round circle. In fact, I suspect that you can create any finite-dimensional convex body whatsoever by such a construction. 

I'm not sure if I know a good source, but I can make a remark. In the category of topological spaces up to homotopy, there is a highly nontrivial geometric invariant that people have taken as interesting: What is the lowest dimension of a topological representative of a given homotopy type? For instance if you have a group $G$, what is the lowest possible dimension of a classifying space $B_G$? The cohomological dimension is a lower bound for this geometric invariant which is more algebraic and sometimes more tractable. For example, if you have a group $G$, it may not be easy to tell whether it is the fundamental group of a compact, hyperbolic $n$-manifold. (Or a Euclidean manifold or a non-positively curved manifold.) If you can compute its group cohomology, then you'll learn something about it, because there is such an $n$-manifold, then the cohomological dimension of $G$ is exactly $n$. As another example, if $G$ is a non-trivial finite group, then it is not hard to compute that its cohomology is periodic and thus known that its cohomological dimension is infinite. Thus, any finite-dimensional CW complex with a non-trivial but finite fundamental group has to have higher homotopy groups. Maybe a good reference is Brown's GTM book on cohomology of groups. 

Your other question is answered by the famous paper of Moser in which he shows that a volume form on a smooth manifold is equivalent to a volume-preserving pseudogroup structure. For this question, first, certain spaces of diffeomorphisms are not contractible when you might expect them to be. This is closely related to Milnor's discovery of exotic smooth structures on spheres (and later other manifolds). For instance, the group of diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{R}^6$ that do nothing outside of a bounded region has 28 components with a $\mathbb{Z}/28$ group structure. In this case it is the same group as the group of smooth 7-spheres. (In $n\ge 5$ to $n+1$ dimensions, there is always an easy-to-construct group homomorphism here, but I am hazy on when it is an isomorphism.) The right question is whether the inclusion of well-behaved volume-preserving diffeomorphisms is a homotopy equivalence with the well-behaved diffeomorphisms. For simplicity let's take a closed manifold $M$ such as a sphere. Then I'm fairly sure that the Moser trick does everything, that it's a deformation retraction from $\text{Diff}(M)$ to $\text{Vol-Diff}(M)$. The Moser trick converts an infinitesimal variation in a volume form $\mu$ to a vector field flow that infinitesimally causes that variation. It uses some fixed reference Riemannian metric on $M$ — the specific retraction depends on that metric. Anyway, if $f$ is a diffeomorphism of $M$ and $\mu$ is a distinguished volume form, then there is first a canonical path from $f_*(\mu)$ back to $\mu$: The ratio is a positive function $g(x)$ and the path is $g(x)^t\mu$. The corresponding Moser flow repairs $f$ and is the deformation retraction. 

Let $X$ be a $\text{CAT}(0)$ space and let $A$ be a compact topological space with a finite Borel measure $\mu$. Then the space of continuous functions $C(A,X)$ has a distance defined by $$d(f,g)^2 = \int_A d(f(t),g(t))^2 d\mu.$$ In general $C(A,X)$ is not complete, but we can take its completion. I suppose that its completion can be called $L^2(A,X)$, and I suppose that it is $\text{CAT}(0)$. If $H$ is a complex Hilbert space, then there is an indefinite inner product on $H' = \mathbb{C} \oplus H$ given by $$\langle \alpha \oplus v, \beta \oplus w \rangle = \langle \alpha,\beta \rangle - \langle v,w \rangle.$$ We can consider the vectors in $H'$ with positive self inner product and with positive first component, divided by complex phase. This is a Hilbert space version of $\mathbb{C}H^\infty$, with a natural Fubini-Study metric. I suppose that it is just the metric completion of the direct limit of $\mathbb{C}H^n$. A $C^*$-algebra $A$ has both a general linear group $\text{GL}(A)$ of invertible operators and a unitary group $\text{U}(A)$ of unitary operators. You can look at the coset space $\text{GL}(A)/\text{U}(A)$, which is an infinite-dimensional analogue of the $\text{CAT}(0)$ homogeneous space $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{C})/\text{U}(n)$. Suppose also that $A$ has a finite faithful trace $\tau$. Then I think that $\tau$ gives you a Riemannian metric on $\text{GL}(A)/\text{U}(A)$. Again, you have to take a completion because this includes special cases of the first construction. I suppose, although in this case I really don't understand things well, that the metric is $\text{CAT}(0)$. 

There is a sequence of Kneser graphs, generalizing the Petersen graph, that comprises a counterexample. Let $k \ge 1$ be an integer and let $G$ be a graph whose vertices are subsets of size $k$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,3k-1\}$. Connect two vertices $A$ and $B$ by an edge if they are disjoint as subsets. Then $G$ has no triangles, because there isn't room for three disjoint subsets. On the other hand, if $A$ and $B$ are not connected by an edge, which is to say they are not disjoint, there is room for a third set $C$ which is disjoint from both of them. Thus if you add any edge $(A,B)$ to this graph $G$, it forms a triangle with $(A,C)$ and $(B,C)$. Now let's count vertices and edges. The graph $G$ has $\binom{3k-1}{k}$ vertices, and each vertex has $\binom{2k-1}{k}$ edges. QED (It is the Petersen graph when $k=2$.) 

Wikipedia says, "Group objects in the category of algebraic spaces over a field are schemes." There is no citation, but in an arXiv paper, arXiv:0907.3880, the claim is cited to the original paper of Artin, "Algebraization of formal moduli". 

Here is an example that says nothing by itself asymptotically, but is still somewhat interesting and suggests further examples. The Poincaré homology sphere has a 120-fold universal cover, and you can calculate that in the round metric the diameter increases by a factor of $\pi/(\arccos \phi^2/\sqrt{8}) \approx 8.09$, where $\phi$ is the golden ratio. This is a vaguely more favorable constant than in your general construction. If $G$ is a compact, simple, simply connected Lie group and $\Gamma$ is a finite subgroup, it seems separately interesting to calculate the diameter of $G/\Gamma$. Since $G$ acts transitively on this coset space, the covering radius of the subset $\Gamma$ is the diameter. Moreover, $G$ has a unique bi-invariant Riemannian metric, although you could also consider a left-invariant metric. The covering radius problem has been widely studied when $G$ is Euclidean space and $\Gamma$ is a lattice. People have also thought about it at least some in, e.g., hyperbolic geometry. I never considered that it would also be very interesting when $G$ is compact. 

Your second question is reviewed in Wikipedia. As Wikipedia explains, Hironaka's big theorem was that it is possible to resolve all singularities of a variety by iterated blowups along subvarieties. I do not know a lot about this theory, but if so many capable mathematicians went to so much trouble to find a method, then surely there is no simple method. On the other hand for curves, there is a stunning method that I learned about (or maybe relearned) just recently. Again according to Wikipedia, taking the integral closure of the coordinate ring of an affine curve, or the graded coordinate ring of a projective curve, solves everything. The claim is that it always removes the singularities of codimension 1, which are the only kind that a curve has. 

My analysis leads to different answers from the above, and to some references. Edit: I get different answers because I changed the question without realizing it. I'm working from the collection of pointed metric balls, i.e., metric balls with a distinguished center. Gabe asked the question about the collection of unpointed metric balls, noting that the same set can be a metric ball with two different centers. That seems more complicated, although I would suggest working from the pointed solution. Let's let $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ be the points in $X$. The distances from $i$ to the other points in the set $X$ induce a strict weak ordering of those points by their distance from $i$. This has the same information as the set of metric balls with center $i$. Thus the information in the metric is given by all of the comparisons between the distances $x_{(i,j)} = d(i,j)$ and $x_{(i,k)} = d(i,k)$. You can express these relations by a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{R}^{n(n-1)/2}$, where the hyperplanes are given by the equations $x_{(i,j)} = x_{(i,k)}$. You might also think about the triangle inequalities satisfied by all of the distances, and the fact that the distances are all positive numbers. The set of feasible distance vectors is called the "metric cone". Although the metric has an interesting combinatorial structure, it looks like it matters for nothing in this particular question: The hyperplanes all meet at an interior point of the cone in which the distances are all equal. In other words, you can always add a constant distance $h \gg 0$ to all of the distances without changing any of the metric balls, so that the triangle inequality and positivity of distance become irrelevant. If a hyperplane arrangement has the property that all hyperplanes are given by setting two coordinates equal, then the arrangement is called "graphical". The coordinates correspond to the vertices of a graph $G$, and the hyperplanes correspond to the edges. The hyperplane arrangement gives you a partially ordered set of chambes and other faces, ordered by inclusion. This poset has a lot of properties and there are techniques to compute the number of faces from $G$. In our case, $G$ is the line graph $T_n$ of the complete graph $K_n$, which is sometimes confusingly called a triangular graph. For $n=3$, my answer is that there are 13 different types of metrics, not 7, corresponding to the hyperplane arrangement $x=y$, $y=z$, $x=z$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In other words, I count 13 types of triangles: 6 scalene, 3 short-base isosceles, 3 long-base isosceles, and 1 equilateral. Some of the types of metrics lie in chambers, meaning generic metrics in which $d(i,j) \ne d(i,k)$ for all $i$, $j$, and $k$. It is a theorem that the number of chambers of the graphical arrangment $A(G)$ of a graph $G$ is $|\chi_G(-1)|$, where $\chi_G$ is the chromatic polynomial of $G$. (See this excellent review by Richard Stanley.) So I asked Maple to compute

It is standard differential geometry to find the differential equation for the geodesics on this surface. (But I could easily have made a mistake in the calculation anyway.) Since it is a complete negatively curved surface, there is exactly one geodesic connecting any two points. You have a curve $\vec{p}(t) = (x(t),y(t),z(t))$ on the surface $z = xy$. The geodesic equation is $$\vec{p}''(t) \propto \vec{\nabla}z \oplus -1$$ (the acceleration is perpendicular to the surface), which expands to $$(x'',y'',x''y+2x'y' + xy'') \propto (y,x,-1).$$ Thus $$\frac{x''}{y} = \frac{y''}{x} = -(x''y+2x'y'+xy'').$$ That is an equation that Mathematica can solve. The only tricky part is to solve it with boundary conditions at both ends, where you may as well assume that the endpoints are at $t=0$ and $t=1$. For that purpose it could be better to minimize the curve's energy, by definition $$E[\vec{p}] = \int_0^1 |\vec{p}'(t)|^2 dt = \int_0^1 (x'^2+y'^2 + (x'y+xy')^2) dt.$$ I don't know the most convenient way to do this numerically, but somehow it should be possible. Again, since the surface is negatively curved, this energy functional is well-behaved. I don't know whether there is a closed form solution in elementary functions. There is a closed form solution for a round paraboloid, but it's messy. 

Here is a problem that I learned from W. Thurston. I do not remember whose problem it was originally. Possibly Conway? Suppose that you have a finite collection of round circles in round $S^3$, not necessarily all of the same radius, such that each pair is linked exactly once. (In particular, no two intersect.) Prove that there is an isotopy in the space of such collections of circles so that afterwards, they are all great circles. 

Thanks to your other question, I was on a LCTVS kick. I did find one general criterion that implies that a locally convex space is paracompact. According to the Encyclopedia of Mathematics, if it is Montel (which means that it is barrelled and the Heine-Borel theorem holds true for it), then it is paracompact. Although this criterion is important, it is of no use to your specific question. I thought I had a proof for half of your question, which I wrote up as the first version of this answer, but I made a mistake and proved something different. My thinking is based on the fact that the normality axiom for a topological space is equivalent to the Tietze extension theorem. (Tietze extension follows from normality. In the other direction, if $A$ and $B$ are the two closed sets, you obtain disjoint open neighborhoods from a continuous function that is 0 on $A$ and 1 on $B$.) However, in my argument I conflated the locally convex direct sum of spaces with the topological direct sum. For a countable direct sum of copies of $\mathbb{R}$, they are the same topology, and they agree with the box topology. But Waelbroeck, LNM 230 points out that they are different in the uncountable case. Let $\alpha$ be an ordinal, for instance an ordinal of cardinality $2^{\aleph_0}$. Then $\mathbb{R}^\alpha$ in the topological direct sum topology satisfies Tietze extension. Let $A \subset \mathbb{R}^\alpha$ be a closed set and let $f:A \to \mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. For $\beta < \alpha$, let $A_\beta$ be the intersection of $A$ and with $\mathbb{R}^\beta$. Suppose that $\alpha = \beta+1$ is a successor ordinal. If $\alpha$ is finite, then the conclusion is standard. Otherwise, by induction, there is an extension $f_\beta$ of $f$ to $\mathbb{R}^\beta$. Moreover, by induction in a different sense, we have already proved that $\mathbb{R}^{\beta+1}$ is normal, since $\beta$ and $\beta+1$ have the same cardinality. So there exists an extension $f_\alpha$ to $\mathbb{R}^\alpha$. If instead $\alpha$ is a limit ordinal, then the extensions all the way up to $\alpha$ work just because they work; that's the behavior of topological direct limits. Having failed to normality for the locally convex direct sum, I can't say much about paracompactness either. :-) However, there is an interesting result called the Michael selection theorem which seems to do for paracompactness what the Tietze theorem does for normality. If the Tietze theorem is useful for your spaces, then maybe the Michael selection theorem is too.
