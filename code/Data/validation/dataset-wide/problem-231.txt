They both live in swampy environments, each exudes a delightful-smelling musky lubricant that allows them to slither through their environment and protects them from contact with the potentially nasty things that live there - and each species slime is both disgustingly stenchy and a deadly toxin to the other species. Contact = mutual death. 

Religion. The horse is a beautiful and holy creature, sacred to the great god OoomphaLoompha, who once incarnated as such and impregnated the Great Turtle Goddess Iki, who took a couple minutes off from her job of holding the world upon her back to give birth to...but that's not important here. What is important is that anyone who attempts to ride, harass, chase, annoy, bother, draw pictures of, cook, eat, sully the hooves of, or in any way whatsoever impede the passage of a horse in any manner shall immediately suffer death, personally delivered by the Priests of OoomphaLoompha, who shall devour the miscreants soul, removing him from the great Cycle of Reincarnation, and etc! 

I believe (pun intended) that "miracles" are the usual trade goods in the god <--> believers thing. Potential converts go to priest with outlandish request ("Oh, priest - we are sorely afflicted with drought, pestilence, famine, and smelly armpits! Can thy god do aught for us? Save us from one or more of our afflictions, oh priest, and we are prepared to believe any sh*t that thou can'st dream up! Fail us and...well, this is a farming community, we've got lots of sharp objects close-to-hand - you get the picture..."). And so the priest goes off, burns some incense, slaughters a perfectly harmless domesticated farm animal (which, never fear, will grace the priestly dinner table that night!), mumbles a bit, and finally goes back to the potential converts and cries, "HEY! LOOKIT THIS...errrrr, uhhhh...BEHOLD!!!!!", whipping out from behind his back a small screw-bottom tube-like container of some kind of smelly-sticky stuff. "Behold!" crieth the priest, "my God has provided THIS unto thee!! Smear this in your armpits and stink no more!!!!". "It's a miracle!" cry the now-true-believers as one. "Our pits no longer reek like a damp dungheap!!! Hallelujah!! We believe! WE BELIEVE!!!!!". (Of course, in the back of the crowd some completely unrepentant infidel is saying, "Uh...I think we'd be better off if we hold out for rain..!" but he gets ignored for now and then is killed off later in the first Pogrom Against The Unduly Stinky - so he really doesn't count). 

The immortal may become an "Adam" or "Genghis Khan" in the sense that he may sire a large portion of the population. Adam is recognised by the Abrahamic faiths as the father of all men. Genghis had 500-1000 direct offspring by most accounts. This immortal being, by fathering one child every ten years, will have by the time that the story takes place fathered as many children as Genghis Khan. Those children will have many children as well. Being spread out across the centuries, the immortal being will likely be an ancestor of almost all living beings. 

Note that on the surface of the planet the location of the north and south magnetic poles would not change, in fact a system with such high angular momentum would seem to be more stable than our current magnetic fields which do in fact wander. The field lines would be about the center of rotation of the two cores. If you want eccentric magnetic fields on the planet, then you might want to consider a more liquid core. This is completely plausible, and you could have phenomenon in which multiple poles appear for a few years or decades. I would suggest giving the planet a thicker atmosphere to protect the inhabitants, and don't give it a moon so that the planet's wobble will be more eccentric. 

The two cores would coalesce due to gravity. You cannot have an "orbit" in an environment with friction, i.e. in a planetary body. One solution would be to have the magnetic i.e. ferrous cores suspended in a super-core of non-magnetic material of higher density than the ferrous cores. The material would need to have the following properties: 

Of all the solutions yet posted, I do not see any mention of expanding the habitable zone such that two planets with long, slightly-different orbital periods would both fit. This would require a very luminous star, I believe doubling the luminosity (average over wavelengths) would triple the distance to the inner and outer edges of the habitable zone. Our solar system has two planets (Uranus and Neptune) at 20 and 30 AU, which are in conjunction about once every 170 years. To expand the habitable zone from it's current 0.7 AU to 1.5 AU boundaries, we need a star about 8-10 times as luminous as the sun. Assuming that the star is the same colour as the Sun that would be a class IV subgiant, which would be too short-lived for life to evolve on, but could theoretically support human life that arrives there for millions of years. These are not uncommon stars, so it is completely plausible that humans find and colonize one if they are out colonizing anyway. If you need to allow for longer or shorter periods between when transfer between the planets will be possible, then you can adjust for star brightness and change the size of the habitable zone accordingly. In the interest of realism, make sure that your chosen brightness falls in an area on the Hertzsprungâ€“Russell diagram with the same colour as the Sun (above or below it on the diagram) in a relatively dense part (i.e. no Sun-coloured 100 luminosity stars). 

Kill Doug Englebart before 1968, and blow up SRI's automation lab. To make doubly certain, ensure that Alan Kay is never born and drop a tac nuke on Xerox PARC. You'll also need to do something to reduce programmer productivity so that projects such as the ones that led to GUIs will never be undertaken - so ensure that computer programmers are federally licensed and regulated, programming tools require a license to purchase and the costs are insanely high, outlaw the production of any computer smaller than a mini-van, and make COBOL the One True Sanctioned Programming Language. (Sorry, Grace, but by today's standards it's a pig...). That oughta do 'er..! 

"Large guns but no small guns" - suppose that on your world no one ever discovered that saltpeter makes a dandy powdered oxidizer. Given the lack of that discovery, there's no gunpowder. Large guns, powered by steam or compressed gasses, might exist, but the use of either implies very very high pressures and massive containers to hold the compressed/hot gas. You can't lug around a giant compressed-air tank holding gasses compressed to 10's of thousands of pounds of pressure. There might even be a sort of "design war" between those favoring "steam cannon" and those favoring "air guns". Best of luck. 

Different groups of gods hang out in different locales. So up North you've got the gods of ice, wind, cold, and naked sauna-bathing, while down South you've got the gods of heat, sand, beach-wear, and ice-cold beer! In the East they're all into mysticism and clam-digging while out west - yep, you guessed it - the gods who are worshiped by the masses are those who are concerned with surfing, earthquakes, and mall-shopping, fer sure! In the middle are all those dull, boring, fly-over gods who are worried about dull/boring stuff like growing corn and raising hogs and such. And - good news, priests and priestesses-to-be - THEY ALL FIGHT WITH ONE ANOTHER! "Damn those gods of the Western Pantheon! Bunch of feckless bastards! HOLY WAR!!!!" scream the Eastern priests, and thousands of their clam-juice-dripping-from-the-corners-of-their-mouths devotees go storming across the continent to take on their tanned surfer-dude counterparts. "Dang them Northerners! When they wuz down here a-fore they done STOLE all our hot tubs and took 'em back with 'em! KILL 'EM ALL!!!!!" cry the Southerners, charging north to take on their counterparts. "Gentlemen! Ladies!", cry the Lords of the Central Plains. "We're tryin' to grow us some soybeans here!". And off THEY go in every different direction in the name of Mom, Apple Pie, and The Great Cornucopia In The Sky! Best of luck - and slay the unbelievers! :-) 

Hitler opens Mein Kampf with a warning that exactly what he was going to do is what happens when the general population takes no interest in politics. He himself entered politics because he views that the more the general populace ignores politics, the more totalitarian the regime can be. If I may get up on a soapbox, I dare say that his rally to get the general populace interested in politics is the reason for the banning of Mein Kampf. There is actually very little antisemitism in that book. 

It is very likely that future civilizations will keep different time measurement scales for different events in spacetime. For religious ceremonies each religion would need to decide if the ceremonies are to be performed as per local time of the person, or as per the time of some specific location such as Earth. Note that we already have discrepancies here on Earth now, for example the Muslim year is shorter than the Gregorian year by I think 12 days. Thus, when a Muslim tells you that he is 65 years old, he may have been born only 63 years ago by the Christian way of counting years. The marking of anniversaries such as independence days, birthdays, remembrance ceremonies, and marriages would likely be done by the local time for the places or the people. Titan may celebrate 2 independence days for every 120 times that India celebrates its independence. However, an Indian on a spaceship to Alpha Centari and back may need to celebrate 15 Indian independence days during his 700 day voyage due to time dilation. During that time, his parents only celebrated their child's birthday twice for the 15 years they were waiting for his return. Legal privileges and responsibilities such as drinking age and driving age will need to be coordinated with the time dilation experienced by the person. Perhaps national ID cards will have a timekeeping device, similar to how radiation workers wear dosimeters today. Activities that must be performed on a schedule will need their time computed as per the location where that activity takes place. The seasons of a planet do not change just because the farmers travel to other star systems. The planning to return to some planet in order to tend to the crops in season there will have to be coordinated to happen once each time the planet revolves around its sun. I imagine that we will need computers to help us calculate when the events take place, and when we must leave our current destination in order to get to the proper location at the proper time, taking both distance and expected travel velocity into account.
