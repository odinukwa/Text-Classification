Easy peezy! If I were to punch you, and you were ready for it, you would 'tense' up and hold your breath correct? 'Tightening' your abs work much the same way. Don't push the stomach out, or breath out. You actually need to inhale, and 'brace for impact'. That's tightening the core. 

Fish oil will purportedly help with inflammation, but the problem lies in finding out how much is enough. More is not necessarily better. If you are injured, and it sounds like you are, your best friend is RICE, or Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation. Anti-inflammatory medication is sometimes included. To reduce inflammation, I see no wrong in reading the instructions on the package containing the fish oil. Your body goes through three phases of healing. They are: 

Your goal regarding these phases are to go through them as fast as possible. As long as you're in pain, it's safe to say you're staying in the inflammation phase. Tendinitis is indicative of overuse. Take it easy-continuing exercise is important, but you risk greater injury given working with the injury. If you were my client, knee flexion and extension would likely be off limits unless it was low impact, like cycling. Dietary recommendations are outside my scope of practice, and not enough information is given for me to feel comfortable doing so. You desire to be rid of inflammation, so in that respect I believe RICE is appropriate. The median intake of DHA is between 1.2 to 1.6g/d for an adult male. No upper intake limit has been established, as there is no evidence stating someone's ever taken too much of it. I got that from the National Agricultural Library: Page 478, last paragraph, USDA report on DRI 

My own rule of thumb for strength training is to start 2 months earlier - that is, in your example, the break period - in the workout routines and to proceed from there with a 1-2 week reboot period. After that and only if it feels ok, I try to proceed at the levels when the break period started. So I guess I am leaning towards the second part of your question, to stay with the routines but have lighter weights. My own experience is that break periods should be part of the training cycle, it is natural to get bored and have other priorities from time to time. I see the reboot routines as opportunities to work on techniques for my favorite exercises (deadlift, squats and military press). 

Check their service agreement, sometimes things break down (this happens to all manufacturers based on discussions at e.g. Funbeat and other training forums) and the guarantee and replacement service is important. My experience from Suunto is that there are no questions asked, almost overnight replacement and very helpful customer service. Others that have Polar etc have similar experiences. Check how open they are (e.g. support for ANT+) and support for exporting measurement data from client/web software. Garmin supports ANT+ (they even bought the company behind the standard). Check how easy it is for simpler do it yourself maintenance, e.g. change batteries. No problems with Suunto. 

Although I disagree with taking on a low carb diet (with special medically advised exceptions), I'd advise you to absolutely consume fat, particularly healthy plant based fats, like nuts and avocados. Avoid animal based fats. Fat will be your primary energy source if you're trying to induce ketosis. But once again, there are far more effective ways of changing your body composition, and realistically speaking, are you willing to eat like that the rest of your life? Otherwise it's simply temporary, and why would you put yourself through the hassle? 

Now keep in mind that all the said functions are intertwined with each other-the effects experienced from inactivity go far deeper than most people realize. There are a myriad number of effects that I'm not listing, both because I don't know them all (no one does), and that the human body's system is so well tied together that it's hard to pinpoint any one thing. The real killer is that last one. Because your father isn't placing a load on his systems to sustain life, his ability to consume oxygen is going to drop. This is an adaptation to his inactivity. Why would the body want to spend more energy maintaining what isn't used? When the time comes to move and labor intensely, it's going to be that much harder for his heart and lungs to adapt. This is where the risk lies in contracting any sort of cardiac condition (especially heart attack). This is also why so many elderly die when shoveling their driveways. By decreasing his muscle mass, he's also decreasing his ability to move, and therefore increasing his risk for breaking bones, because there's not enough muscle to counteract imbalances. This doesn't include decreased sensitivity to insulin (prediabetes or diabetes). This also is why many people die soon after breaking a hip-they're too inactive, so they have no muscle, and in turn they fall and break a hip. They're now bedridden. Because their VO2 is so low and decreases even further, their heart eventually fails. Your (and your father's) body was not designed to take it easy all the time. It was designed to work-and work efficiently. Our bodies were designed to strive towards being lazy, but not actually be lazy. If he wants to live longer, he has to move. That's the bottom line. He's going to die if he doesn't. 

I did a quick read through of the search "eating nuts health risk" at Google Scholar at limited the search to 2012 and later, see $URL$ It does not seem to be any health risks. A search for "eating nuts gaining weight" on the same source, see $URL$ and a quick reading of the abstracts shows some result that seem to contradict that nuts are especially effective for weight gain. 10-12 years ago when I was overweight (BMI>26), the main cause was a high consumption of protein shakes and too little exercise. My idea behind the shakes was to reduce stress and I read in a book about stress that high intake of proteins would reduce stress hormones. 

My advice would be to continue. If you have a normal life with all sorts of commitments, you your are bound to miss work-outs and not follow all dietary advice during the 60 days that the program prescribes. This shouldn't matter for a robust work-out routine. Also, given that Beachbody's "go to market" model is based on "multi-level marketing", see Wikipedia Beachbody and Wikipedia Multi-level marketing, you should have a critical view of all the material on the net regarding the result after program. 

Are you talking about a "six pack"? That's essentially one muscle, called the Rectus Abdominus. They are always there. You can induce hypertrophy, an increase in size (of the muscle cells), but that's limited. As someone stated in another post, abs are built in the kitchen before they're built in the gym. As a strength professional, I lean away from sits ups and similar exercises because that's more hip flexion than it is core work. Planks are your friend. You'll hit your core during EVERY exercise, and it's impossible not too. It's essential for stability. Keep that in mind-if you decrease stability (closer stance, bosu ball), you'll increase 

Sprinting sessions typically are once to twice a week. When sprinting, you want to work with either low intensity (<75%), or high intensity (>95%). Don't try and skirt the middle, as you won't ream any real benefit from it. Low intensity will be good for development of improved sprinting form, active recovery, and improved endurance. High intensity will allow for great adaptation when translating gains from resistance training and working said gains in concert with neuromuscular demands. If you're going to sprint maximally, make sure you have complete recovery-at least 48 hours before you tackle sprinting again. The way you plan on training lines up with that recommendation. 

*Female Medley Swimmers - BMI as a function of Height (BMI = 51.4-17.4*Height (in meters))* All of them (and most of the others I checked) do seem to be taller than you so that can be an argument against just comparing the BMI. However, the datapoint of, for example, Yasuko shows that it is possible to compete & win without being above average height. For you, BMI 23 means 60-61 kg. 

Searching for "massage flexibility" on Google scholar shows a large numbers of results. An overview of the result is that: Massage in general seems to be as good as stretching for flexibility and Thai massage seems to be at least as good as Swedish massage (the most popular type of massage practised in the US). However, massage differs from stretching, e.g. see caring hormones massage and seems to be better for recovery. When to do the massage is harder to find research on. My personal experience of Thai massage is that properly done, it is relaxing but also makes you a bit tired afterwards. So in terms of doing it before or after workouts, it makes more sense to do it after workouts or on recovery days. In an ideal world, perhaps all exercise should be followed by massage but the time and cost would be prohabitive. So your plan of massage twice a month seems to be reasonable. 

You must keep in mind that bodyfat is essential to the human body. It's not necessarily a bad thing, and there is certainly a minimum requirement for good health. For example, it's absolutely necessary for nervous system function (myelin sheaths act as insulators for nerves, and are made up of fat). Of course, in regards to your training and diet, there are a number of factors in play. It's possible with the training volume you're looking at, that you're actually not eating enough. If you haven't created a surplus of calories, your body is going to try to conserve energy vs building muscular adaptations. How has your performance improved after 2 years of crossfit? Have you hit a plateau? If you haven't gotten stronger, this may be an indicator that your training needs to change. To answer your question, I don't think you're going to get solid answers from a medical doctor. Their job is to get you healthy, not improve your performance. You'd be much better served by a performance facility that employs strength coaches who have CSCS certification or similar, or a dietitian (not a nutritionist!). You can get truly accurate body comp from a DEXA scan (a test done for bone density) bod pod (air displacement) or someone who knows how to use medical-grade skin fold calipers (not the 20 dollar ones). Stay away from bio-electrical impedance (the one where it sends an electrical current through your hands). Finally, focus on your performance. Train the movement, not the muscle. If you focus on that, the muscles and improved aesthetics will come. 

The switch from the pool to the lake/ocean can be challenging. Google on "overcome fear of open water swimming" or "panic attack triathlete water" and you will find that you are not alone. There are two aspects of your question: 

Besides the excellent advice in the other responses, I would like to add some points: First, only run when it is cold if you really have to, for example, Sunday January 13th, in Stockholm it was -9 Celcius (C) (16 Fahrenheit (F)) (-15 C considering the wind chill factor). A warmer Sunday, you would see lots of people running at the popular city parks Djurgården and Gärdet. That day, you hardly saw anyone. So even when you have a large population used to cold weather & snow & ice , most of them avoid intense outdoor exercise in the cold. The key reasons are that it is difficult to breathe (even if you are used to cold air) and the risks of falling. As a guideline, youth cross country skiers are not allowed to compete under -15 C (5 F), primarily because of the breathing and frostbite risks. Outdoors ice hockey games are cancelled if the temperature is below, -18 C (0 F). In both of these contexts, the participants are used to cold weather and in excellent shape. 

You are asking about the effects of a sedentary lifestyle. This is certainly related to physical fitness, or rather a lack thereof, contrary to what some of my fellow members here feel. There are a number of physiological adaptations that will result from too much inactivity. I like to say that our bodies are built to be as lazy as possible. Efficiency is the driving force behind survival-if you're not going to use muscle, why spend energy maintaining it? The effects of inactivity are wide and very detrimental to health. Your father is going to experience the following: 

As strength coaches, we can sometimes fall victim to using terms that are too technical for the client to understand. I'd like to know if a compendium exists that revolves around external cuing, "push the ground away" vs "extend your knees",or "show the logo on your chest" vs "you are hip dominant". External is almost always superior for a number of reasons, but I have yet to see a comprehensive resource for coaches or trainers to turn to. 

The reason your spine hurts is because the hip flexors, typically used during sit up style exercises, are attached to your spine. Your core is hanging on for its dear life during extended sit up style exercise regimes in order to save your back. Over 800 newtons of force are placed on the attachment points in the spine during sit ups. If you want to mitigate that, execute a Mcgill sit up-one leg extended, one leg bent. Ensure that when executing a crunch, you only perform 30 degrees of flexion in the spine. Shoulder blades should leave the deck, but at no point should you be "sitting up". I'm going to agree with others here in saying that there are many exercises that utilize the core anyway-if you're doing it right you don't really need to focus on the core. I ensure that when prescribing, my clients do not have too much sit up style exercises. Planks are king, not sit ups. Planks don't involve spinal flexion. 

and to capture the actual workout through taking pictures of the index card or similar (see a picture of notes from a swim workout) and combining the two in a system like Evernote. This way I can analyze unlimited by the constraints of paper (e.g. moving averages is tedious when done manually) and still have the raw data for individual workouts available if needed. 

Choosing a "train - no pain" path is interesting. The question has two parts: A. Tips on advancing the workout B. Studies on pleasureable and painless workouts. A. A general tip on advancing the suggested workoutis to work on the technique of your exercises. Squats, as an example, film yourself doing squats, compare & contrast with how it is done by masters you know or on what you can see on the net. Log your improvements in technique instead of logging the increased weight. B. Google Scholar: "joyful physical training Various papers about how to increase the motivation when the focus of training is to have fun, especially for children. Google Scholar: "light physical training", one paper that was interesting is that rats training at 60% of VO2max (i.e. moderate exercise) also show an increase in bone growth. Given that your motivation is increased following your way, you can increase the chance of training over a longer period of time which is good for you, see Google Scholar: life long training, here the study of "Physical Activity and Muscle Training in the Elderly" shows that the body responds to resistance traning into the 70s.
