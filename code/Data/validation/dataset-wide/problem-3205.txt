Darius I "the Great" (549-486 BC), one of the early kings of the ancient Achaemenid (Persian) Empire was well-known for employing many spies (known as the "king's ears") in his service. This well-documented usage of spies by the early Persian king is at least as early, if not earlier than Sun Tzu's mention of spies in the Chinese histories. I would also consider it quite likely that Darius I inherited this practice from even earlier Persian kings, and perhaps even other cultures he conquered. From this source on the Acaemenid Empire 

Let me do my best to attempt an answer here... Sicily and its people have always be oddly unique. Italian, yet not Italian. They share much in common with their mainland Italian neighbours (particularly the southerners), in language, culture, history, and ethnicity -- but their particular history stands out more than most. Widely speaking, the people and culture of Siciliy are something of a great hybrid or "melting pot". Ethnic/genetic studies have been conducted that show a large degree of affinity with southern and even central Italians. (Apologies, I lack the source for this presently.) There are also notable, albeit minor admixtures from principally North African and Near-Eastern peoples. This is undoubtedly thanks to Moorish raids and partial Arab conquests during the early Middle Ages. On average, I think it is fair to say that Sicilians show greater genetic diversity than most Italians -- it is not uncommon for them to have particularly dark complexions or Middle Eastern features (thanks to Arab and Moorish rule); likewise reddish or light hair is not overly rare (inherited from the Norman conquests undoubtedly). Saying that, a plurality if not majority of the population descend from the Roman and pre-Roman inhabitants above all. Undoubtedly there is also a significant proportion of Greek blood in Sicilians, from the time of the Magna Graecia colonies to the Byzantines, but this is somewhat harder to distinguish visually or scientifically thanks to the strong similarities and continual interaction between Greek and southern Italian/Sicilian populations. Culturally, it's hard to untangle the origins and complex nature of Sicily. At least from my position. There are indeed whole books written on the subject. Of particular interest is the recent history (past two centuries), where Sicily came out of feudal/baronial rule, and eventually joined under Italian Reunification. The process was a tumultuous one, especially considering the poverty of the island that exists even to this day. There were numerous quite apparent causes for the explosion in crime during these 19th century transformations -- the origin of the Mafia/Cosa Nostra in Sicily/Italy and ultimately the USA owes to these upheavals. Now, while the Spanish (Aragonese and then Hapsburgs) ruled the island for centuries beginning in the late Middle Ages and Early Modern era respectively, the Spanish cultural (or for that matter genetic) influence was probably not very great. It was mainly manifested in terms of aristocratic rule and pan-European wars, I believe. Sicily has an unfortunate (at least in some ways) history of being under foreign domination, both of the involuntary and requested sort (that ultimately leads to loss of too many of their freedoms). The Normans and the Spanish did not secure their rule over the island until they were effectively invited in by certain powerful persons at the time. One of most intriguing points of Sicilian history is that when the Normans initiated their rule, they did their very best to stamp out all signs of Arab/Muslim culture that had come to dominate the island strongly for a couple of centuries at the end of the 1st millennium. The Muslims and Jews were expelled at various points leading up to the end of the Reconquista. Since the fall of the Roman Empire, Sicily had transitioned between Byzantine and Arab rule for the most part, and the population was fundamentally Orthodox Christian. Only when the Normans came did Roman Catholicism get truly embedded, while Islam was all but eradicated. Norman/Angevin rule did not prove too stable (it was often exploitative or even cruel), and gave way to their Aragonese "liberators", whose rule persisted in some form (through their descendents) until the early 19th century. The Sicilian dialect of the Italian language (some consider it a separate language) and for the most part their culture persisted with little alteration throughout these centuries. Commerce links with mainland Italy were usually present, as indeed Sicily had been a great source of agricultural wealth since pre-Roman times. So, while this provides a far from conclusive answer, hopefully I've offered a few insights into my limited knowledge of Sicilian history and its influences. Culture is invariably a hard thing to quantify, but perhaps you get the gist anyway. Sorry I can't be any more precise! 

I encountered an interesting quote on the English Wikipedia page for Germania some time ago, which seems to have persisted, albeit without citation. I was hoping someone could find a reliable source (ideally the primary source, which is probably Caesar's Gallic Wars, or a translation thereof). 

This is a fascinating quote in any case, and one that is relevant both to Julius Caesar as a man and on a macrohistorical level in some ways. So any proper citation or hints as to its origin would be much appreciated. On the tenor of the quoted text, it would at least to seem to accord with my readings on Caesar (which is not insignificant), in that he found the Celts savage and primitive in most ways, but not beyond redemption. Clearly he found the German tribes rather more barbaric and felt the need to launch two swift punitive expeditions across the Rhine and into Greater Germania (which certainly had the desired effect of scaring the tribes and preventing further raids into Gallic territory). Indeed, this was the pretext for the Gallic Wars for a start, after a few Gallic tribes had sought Rome's assistance in driving off Germanic incursions from across the Rhine, as far as I remember. So yes, this quote would certainly appear to agree with Caesar's personal views and actions, as they have been recorded with history. But a more direct citation would be wonderful. 

The Rigveda, a collection of sacred texts that has formed the base of the Hindu religion and much Indian culture, was verbally composed (originally in archaic Sanskrit) as early as 1700 BC. The Rigveda represents the earliest known writings by the Indo-Aryan peoples, though no document survives containing the original Sanskrit text -- in fact, nothing from anything near that period. The Indus Script had died out by the this time, and writing did not return until around the 3rd century BC, until which (at the very earliest) the Vedas must have been transmitted from generation to generation orally. Now, the Indus Valley civilisation, which is commonly thought to have died out either before or during the invasion/migration of the Indo-Aryan people into north-west India, possessed its own entirely different language (non Indo-European, possibly Dravidian) and possibly writing system (Harappan script), although linguists are yet to determine if Harappan symbols actually represented a language. If the Harappan script ever gets deciphered and translated, then literary evidence of pre-Aryan civilisation, going back perhaps as far as 2600 BC, may be revealed. As it stands, the Rigveda is the oldest known literary reference to life in India. The problem is that all nearby civilisations were illiterate in the technical sense at this time (excepting the undecipherable Harappan script). Chinese writing was only developed at earliest from 1600 BC. While Elamite and Sumerian scripts in the Middle East would have been long established by 1700 BC, the contact between these civilisations and the Ancient Indo-Aryan civilisation has not been recorded in history, unfortunately. 

The answer to this question depends somewhat on the kingdom, geography, and era. The ancient Achamaemenid Empire of Persia (Iran) was arguably the first true empire in history, and spanned a sizeable amount of territory. It made use of regularly stationed outputs with stables always containing well-fed and well-rested horses, for messengers to quickly get around the empire. Combined with a primitive road system (which the Romans used to excellent military and economic advantage in their later empire), this ensured good communication and administration of the kingdom. Alexander the Great, having conquered Persia in the 4th century B.C., inherited this network of roads and indeed learned from the Persian method of government. In addition, the sub-division of an empire into smaller regions, run by local rulers or trusted generals, led to early top-down bureaucratic forms of rule that worked quite well. For Alexander the Great and the Macedonian Empire, these rulers were "satraps"; for Rome they were provincial governors. In summary: the combination of regular stationed outposts (garrisons for the army, and trading/tax collection stations), and the pyramid-like sub-division of territories for administration by petty rulers and officials led to a, while often fragile, fairly efficient and manageable form of impirial administration that worked for the Persians, Macedonians, Romans, and later the Mongols.
