Oceanic topography of the sea surface $\zeta$ can be defined as the height of the sea surface relative to a particular level surface, the geoid. The geoid to be the level surface that coincided with the surface of the ocean at rest (a list of geoids with application to oceanography can be found in Talone et al., 2014). Variations in sea surface height (topography) are due to processes that result in ocean motion: ocean currents, tides, and changes in barometric pressure from the inverted barometer effect. As a result, we usually call it "dynamic topography" or "dynamic height". As geoid undulations are of order 100 times larger than the dynamic height, the shape of the sea surface is dominated by local geoid variations caused by gravity with the effect of the currents being much smaller. In the image you provide what you have is "dynamic height" and thus is a deviation from the geoid and the result of oceanic currents. By knowing the dynamic height, we can get an idea of the surface geostrophic current: $\mathrm{u_s= − {g\over f} {\delta\zeta\over\delta y}}$; $\mathrm{v_s= − {g\over f} { \delta\zeta\over\delta x}}$ where f is the Coriolis parameter, g is gravity, and $\zeta$ is the height of the sea surface above the level surface (geoid). Now, there is a direct effect between currents and bathymetry that sometimes is referred to as Taylor columns. The Taylor-Proudman theorem enforces that vertical columns of fluid move along contours of constant fluid depth. The basic idea behind this is that in order to conserve vorticity, fluid parcels tend to follow bathymetric contours (isobaths). So to answer your question, bathymetry affects ocean topography indirectly by affecting ocean currents. 

In the recently published article by Kossin et al. (Nature, 2014, dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13278), they show that there is a trend toward poleward migration of the location of tropical cyclone (hurricanes and typhoons) maximum intensity in most areas of the world. Their proposed explanation focuses on the tropical expansion (the increasing area of the world where tropical phenomena is observed has expanded in time). Is there some alternative explanation for the poleward migration of the hurricanes? The shift seems to be occurring in the Pacific and Indian Oceans but not in the Atlantic. How can we explain that difference? 

The idea is that by including both the Ekman current (induced by the mean wind stress at the surface) and the wave-induced current (Stokes drift), the resulting total surface velocity can be easily represented as a function of wind velocity at 10 meters. Both Ekman and wave-induced currents are about the same size and add up to be around 3% of the wind speed. The assumptions include the full range for Ekman dynamics (homogeneous, not affected by boundaries), plus some about waves (non-decaying, small amplitude). In the real ocean, eddy viscosity is vertically variable, but, as it is the case with Ekman dynamics, the approximation is quite close to what is observed in the ocean. The approximations that Weber used are valid for a large range of wind values (5-30 m s−1) and they break down in weak wind (not fully developed waves) and strong wind conditions (whitecapping, wave breaking).

Ide et al. (2016) suggest that earthquakes (especially those of high magnitudes) are more probable during periods of high tidal stress (during full and new moons). While they show a comprehensive dataset and analysis to corroborate their claims, it contradicts previous findings (e.g., Kennedy et al., 2004). Their argument claiming that tides trigger the transformation from small fracture to the large rupture associated with large earthquakes seems counter-intuitive to me. Wouldn't it make more sense for the relatively small changes associated with the tidal stress to be more related to smaller earthquakes? 

Tides observations everywhere show that spring tides occur not at full or new moon, at the time of maximum driving forces, but typically a day or two later. What causes this delay? 

First, a bit of background, following the Navier-Stokes equations and assuming steady state conditions, we can obtain a simplified balance known as Ekman balance for the boundary layer of the upper ocean (order hundred meters). In this part of the ocean horizontal gradients are small compared to vertical gradients. Under these conditions, there is a balance between Coriolis, and friction (sometimes the pressure gradient force needs to also be considered in the balance). The resulting theoretical flow has a vertical structure with decreasing magnitude with depth and flow direction progressively rotating to the right (left in the southern hemisphere) as depth is increasing. This is known as the Ekman spiral. Source: $URL$ Under these conditions, in the open ocean (in fact assuming an infinitely deep ocean), the transport in the Ekman layer is perpendicular to the wind direction. The depth of the Ekman layer, or Ekman depth, is simply dependent on Coriolis and viscosity: $$D_e = \sqrt{2K_m\over f}$$ where $K_m$ is the kinematic turbulent viscosity (assumed constant) and $f$ is the Coriolis parameter (a typical value for mid-latitudes is $10^{-4}$ $s^{-1}$). Typical Ekman depths are of order 10 to 30 meters. Typical values for $K_m$ are around $0.1$ $m^2/s$ (not to be confused with molecular viscosity that is around $10^{-6}$ $m^2/s$) but can vary by several orders of magnitude, resulting in a range of $D_e$ of $10-150m$. A good explanation of Ekman balance and much more information can be found in Cushman-Roisin & Beckers (Chapter 8). While all that is useful in a theoretical setting, the depths obtained from observations of the Ekman depth can be approximated by the expression: $$D_e = 0.4\sqrt{\tau\over f^2 \rho_0 }$$ where $\tau$ is the wind stress magnitude and $\rho_0$ is water density. The factor $0.4$ has been derived empirically and can varied slightly under different oceanic conditions. All that was describing the surface boundary layer, but in reality a bottom boundary layer also forms. The solution to the bottom layer can also be approximated as an Ekman layer for which the forcing is not the wind, but the bottom friction. The resulting boundary layer also has an Ekman depth approximated with the expression above. In an sloping bottom, the boundary layer follows the bottom slope and the thickness (depth above bottom) of the layer (measured perpendicular to the bottom) is scaled by the cosine of the bottom slope. Taking 10 meters (one of the smallest values in mid-latitudes) for the surface and bottom boundary layer thicknesses, that implies that in water depths shallower than 20 m the two boundary layers overlap. In water depths shallower than that, the transport in the surface layer is no longer perpendicular to the wind direction. The momentum input into the water by the wind (wind stress) is affected by the presence of the bottom and it is directly dissipated by bottom friction. The mixing by the wind (and wave breaking near the surf zone) results in additional mixing through the water column and facilitating well-mixed water columns. Under these conditions the wind-induced currents extend all the way to the bottom with the direction of the flow being a function of bottom depth, wind direction, and bottom slope. The presence of wind-induced currents does not preclude the occurrence of flow in the opposite direction of the wind. A fantastic article summarizing the different flow conditions under different wind and wave fields in shallow water depths is given in Lentz and Fewings (2012).

There are several similar examples: 17 January and 6, 20 and 24 February What causes these features? Why are they of that size? 

The question also mentions downwelling associated with dense water formation. Deep water forms at high latitudes (typically north and south of 60°) in both the southern and northern hemispheres. As mentioned in the question, ice contains almost no salt, so when ice forms, a salty, sub-zero brine is left behind and sinks. In the Antarctic, as the saltier water moves down, it mixes with slightly warmer intermediate water. The mixture becomes Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), which flows northwards along the bottom in all the main oceans. In the Arctic, the northward flowing branch of the Gulf Stream (salty and warm) joins the subpolar gyre and enters the Labrador Sea where as it cools, it starts to sink. The eastern branch of the Gulf Stream begins to sink in the Nordic Seas. The resulting water masses combine to form the dense North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) that flows south at depth. Both the creation of AABW and NADW can be considered downwelling, as there is a net downward flow in the formation areas, but they are not related to wind-driven downwelling in the vicinity of coasts. 

Here is a very simplistic approximation: The total volume of the oceans (no lakes, rivers, water vapor) is around $1.3\ 10^9$ cubic kilometers. The surface area of Earth is around $5\ 10^8$ square kilometers. Dividing the volume by the area, we get a depth of 2.5 kilometers. The fresh water contribution is about 3% of the volume of salt water. In reality, other factors such as the fact that Earth is not spherical, density changes, and that the water will be acted upon by tidal forces and other interactions, will make the distribution uneven. 

The effects of Coriolis in rivers and estuaries are more subtle than in the open ocean. Coriolis tends to be a second or third order process in fast-moving and relatively small systems like rivers. On the other hand, when the residual flow in an estuary is considered, then that process tends to be slow and persistent and the effects of Earth's rotation (Coriolis) can be more obvious. The residual flows tend to be much weaker than tidal flows in estuaries. Both seaward and landward residual flows are going to be slightly displaced to the right of the direction of flow (in the northern Hemisphere) resulting in asymmetric flows. The resulting exchange flow (in the northern Hemisphere), looking in up-estuary direction, is going to have denser seawater flowing into the estuary in the deeper right side of the estuary, while fresher (lighter) river water will tend to flow seaward near the surface along the left side of the estuary. Source GSO-URI. The asymmetric flow exchange will affect any particle in suspension (e.g., organisms, sediment). In general, estuarine circulation tends to create areas of high turbidity (estuarine turbidity maximum, ETM) in the vicinity of the tip of the salt wedge. Decomposition of organic material in the high turbidity zone of the ETM can cause oxygen depletion, especially in the lower part of the vertical where mixing with oxygen-rich surface water is inhibited by stratification. In a system where Coriolis is a relevant factor, the distribution of this anoxic conditions (the often called "dead zone") is going to be displaced and can be more extensive in the right side of the estuary.

Hydrothermal vents are common in areas subject to volcanic activity at the bottom of Earth's oceans. Meanwhile, hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa and maybe in other moons of the Solar System. Vents on Earth are beginning to be understood and the complex ecosystems associated with them provide many new and fascinating discoveries. My question is what are differences between vents in the two systems? 

There are lots of studies considering Lagrangian dispersion. One critical aspect is the addition of random displacement to the deterministic particle track in order to consider subgrid-scale processes. Your measure of dispersion seems acceptable except for the fact that it might be dependent on the resolution of your flow field. In order to compare your dispersion with other areas or times, you might need to scale it by the horizontal diffusivity of the flow. Some studies that could be helpful are Mariano et al. (2002), Proehl et al. (2005), Lynch & Smith (2010). 

The explanation of all the tidal constituents is pretty complex because of the interactions between the different frequencies involved. The harmonic analysis is an expansion of the Equilibrium Theory of Tides into a set of harmonic terms. The list of relevant periods includes: 

A new study by Batygyin and Laughlin suggest that a Jupiter migration toward the inner region of the Solar System during the early stages of system formation cleared the habitable region (Goldilocks zone) around the Sun from early planets that too large and with atmospheres too dense to support life. As they put it: 

The easiest products that provides ocean bathymetry (bottom depth) is the one you mentioned: $URL$ It provides bathymetry data from a plethora of surveys. If you click in the map at any location, you will get a decent estimate of the depth at that point. You can also extract the surveys and data that are available for any given location. You also get DEMs and Lidar data. You can define a bounding box or a polygon (Identify tab) and it will provide the links to the original data. The original data in areas where no recent surveys are available is usually either from ETOPO or GEBCO. If you are interested in a specific area you can also use a region selector directly from GEBCO (pick a box around all your points and extract the data that way). You can also try NOAA electronic navigational charts. 

The answer to the main question is that we are capable of forecasting salinity 100 years into the future. The more relevant question might be how well are we currently forecasting salinity. First, lets look at what we know about how salinity is currently changing. Global salinity is the result of the balance between surface freshwater flux (evaporation minus precipitation), terrestrial runoff and mixing and advective processes in the ocean. The changes in salinity are intrinsically connected to alterations in the global hydrological cycle and are expected to be a consequence of climate change (Held and Soden, 2006). A general change has been identified with surface subtropical areas becoming saltier and high-latitude regions becoming fresher (Antonov et al., 2002; Boyer et al., 2005). Durack and Wijffels (2010) found salinity increases in regions dominated by evaporation while freshening occurred in precipitation-dominated regions. They suggested the change was a consequence of an intensification of the global hydrological cycle. These results are the basis for the conclusions in the IPCC 2013 report (TFE.1 Figure 1). 

While there have been lots of studies looking at the effect of greenhouse gasses on increasing temperatures around the planet, my question is what are the effects of emissions on food production. 

The most up-to-date version of the sediment transport module is part of the Coupled Ocean – Atmosphere – Wave – Sediment Transport (COAWST) modeling system. A good description of the model and its capabilities is given in Warner et al. (2010). The code can be downloaded from here. The current version of CSTMS can model both cohesive (mud) and non-cohesive sediment (sand) sediments, bedload transport and sediment deposition and erosion caused by waves and currents.
