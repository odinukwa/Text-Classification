Inspect the bridge and footings. Is soil eroded behind the footing. Has the bridge shifted on the footing. Is the bridge cracked or is anything missing. With livestock cross one at a time with livestock trailing to distribute the weight. They probably just have a proper protocol that an engineer must inspect the bridge after a certain water level. That suspension design is a professionally designed bridge. The age of that bridge would make me more confident. It has likely survived high water before. 

I would not have guessed you could deplete O₂ or saturate CO₂ but evidence that you can. You compared to a tent. A typical backpacking / climbing tent design is different. The walls and ceiling are breathable with a rain-fly over the top. Even a 4 season tent is breathable. 

The tradeoff between longevity and performance is not easy to resolve; I feel that if you are carrying your water on your back, the tradeoff is always to drink less than needed for optimal performance. Some people will surely disagree though. 

I am doing little kayaking and just a bit more skiing (the seasons for both are very short where I live). Both of these need helmets, but I feel reluctant to buy 2 items, each of which will see little use. So I wonder whether I can buy 1 helmet that will be sufficiently safe (but not necessarily convenient) for both activities. My thoughts so far: 

I have a very simple reasoning about it. It's only based on personal experience, so don't regard it as absolute truth. Your body needs a certain amount of water to be comfortable, say, N. Comfort here includes urination (removal of poisons from body) and sweating (removal of heat). If you drink N or more, the body will function well. If you drink less than N, the body will adjust to the deficit of water; it will decrease urination (so unwanted stuff will accumulate in the body), and then reduce sweating (body temperature will rise, leading to bad mood and less-than-optimal physical power). You can often tolerate these effects (e.g. in emergency; also in general, depending on your goal and attitude), so you should drink less than your "normal" need. In additon, imagine that you decided to conserve your water and drink 80% of N during the day, and you accept the ill effects of doing so. If you temporarily exceed that plan, drinking e.g. 30% of N in a quarter of a day, the body will "use" the excess water for natural but undesirable functions (urination/sweating). So you should be careful about how much you drink, and not succumb to thirst easily. 

As for raw cardio stairs or stair trainer. Or running, walking, bicycle. Include some walking with a fully loaded pack to get you body used to bearing the weight. Search on "altitude training". There are altitude training masks but not everyone agrees they are effective. There are altitude training tents, rooms, and even sleep tents. A gym near you may have an altitude training tents, rooms They reduce the oxygen to simulate altitude. The idea is to get your body to produce more the oxygen carrying red blood cells. There are drugs to produce more red blood cells but not something I would advise. Don't - it can kill you. Before cyclist got good at it many died. If you can spend just a one or two days at elevation with some light excise before going high your body will adjust. Look up signs and treatment of high altitude pulmonary edema before you go. If you are crossing a pass maybe sleep in the valley rather than on top of the pass. 

If you can grab your current hold with both hands: do a pull-up, as high as possible. Then release your feet, in any convenient way. While your body starts swinging, reverse the pull-up, so your arms reach fully extended position when your body is roughly vertical. Then try not to lose your grip while your body continues the swing. The idea here is that somehow your angular velocity is getting eaten up by your body straightening, like in the example with the spinning skater (I cannot really explain it physically). With less angular velocity it's easier to stabilize your body with your feet in the air. Not sure you can apply this in your specific situation. 

First of all, don't coil your rope in the "usual" U-shape, like climbers do! (example picture) Or in ASCII art 

Maybe spend a bit more and look for something for other uses also. Shopping or airplane carry on bag. Make sure it will hold what you need but day hiking does not need to be its only use. 

The heat to melt is the same so will not make a lot of difference. A larger pan will have more surface area and be more efficient. Continually add snow and ladle out water with a small cup. Unless it is really cold out you can put snow in a clear container and leave it in the sun. 

Clean and condition. REI Good old saddle soap is good. Then lots of boot conditioner as the salt will dry them out. Then water proofing. 

Consider splitting the kit. Put dressings, scissors, hemostat, tape ... in one for non perishables. I like using a fishing tackle box. Athletic tape, antiseptic powder, saline solution, and bar soap all hold up in the heat pretty well. In a car accident with major problems you are not worried about ointments. Airway, bleed, stabilize, and get professional medical help. Ointment and other perishables a small box or even a bag and store under the seat. Or a thermos - like a coffee thermos. Look at Klean Canteen insulated food canister. Rotate out as needed. I would check every 6 - 12 months. 

Suppose you need to cover a fairly long distance (e.g. 30 km) in a moderately difficult hiking terrain (no climbing), in 1 day. You can either go alone or with someone, or with a group. I think (from experience) that alone is always faster. Is it right, and if yes, why? What are the factors that make me waste time? How much time should I expect to waste? Let's eliminate physical fitness differences for the sake of argument. If the answer is no (i.e. group hiking time is the same or better than alone time): How can I achieve the fastest group hiking time -- which typical time wasters to avoid, and how? 

When climbing a multi-pitch route, suppose I am belaying the second climber, using Reverso or a similar device. It lets me arrange the rope in such a way that when the climber falls, the rope automatically tightens, and the fall is stopped without the belayer's intervention (see picture). However, some people say that I need to hold the rope anyway. What is the reason for this requirement? I could come up with the following explanations: 

It is not clear how they scraped but I would try a tool like is used for scraping tile off a floor. Then sweep the chips off. Then add a small amount of hot water to the problem spots. For a squeegee I would look at a roller squeegee like is used for tennis courts. 

Nalgene is owned by Fisher Scientific. They do lab bottles, recreational bottles, and lab equipment. Boiling water is a probable exposure. If bad thing happen the lawyers would be putting out warnings. Not 100% but a product listed to be dishwasher safe is likely to be safe at boiling temperature. Accoring to this Nalgene currently uses Eastman Tritan copolyester sans any trace of polycarbonate. According to this data sheet the melting temperature is 500 F. I do not find operating ranges. See autoclave - 120 F. No more BPA but with PBA products there is information it will leach at a higher rate at higher temperature. There is some fear other products in plastic are not good for you but have not yet been discovered. Not sold by Nalgene but you can buy coffee presses for their bottles. one press Video of boiling water test 

When I am abseiling, the rope is initially hard to feed through my braking device - if I take my hands away from the rope, I get stuck in mid-air. However, as I am getting lower, it gradually gets easier, until at some point the rope starts running by itself. Now, if I took my hands away from the rope (thought experiment - imagine I have no backup braking device), I would accelerate down and hit the ground very hard. Why is this so? The rope is vertical, and I don't touch any wall, and yet it somehow matters whether I am situated high or low on the rope. I am abseiling on a static rope, the height is 60 meters. Just to make it clear - the wall is absolutely vertical, and then somewhat overhanging, so the wall doesn't hinder my progress in any way. 

I think you are better off describing the conditions. Like choppy and or gusty. The boat could heel / lean, rock, or even capsize. It is more the captain and crew that are floundering. Past flounder is distress. Crew and or boat need help. 

I don't think two whippets makes sense. Personally if I think I might need self arrest then I want an ice axe. If I am going to ski down something steep enough that I am worried about stopping if I fall then I want two ski poles to minimize my chance of falling (and probe for snow conditions). A whippet when you have conditions you feel you can stop (arrest) with a whippet. And you don't think you could stop without one. 

I think you mean moisture - humidity is still in the air. What is interesting is the moisture collected only on the floor so it is probably the coolest spot in the tent. Try thicker wood over the pallets or skip the pallets as they let cool air circulate under the tent. The ground holds heat pretty well. 

The above is especially true for belaying the second climber; it is also usually true for belaying the leader; however, when the station is very comfortable and you (the belayer) have nowhere to fall, there is little use in passing your rope through the anchor. In this case, until the leader places the first piece of protection, he most likely hits the ground (or ledge you are standing on), and the rope doesn't help. Also, you might want to help him land safely in this case (aka "gymnastic belay"), and being attached to the anchor hinders your movement. So, in this case you should not pass the rope through the anchor. 

(The following part describes belaying the second climber. I have never tried to belay a leader with belay device anywhere except my harness, and I suspect it's impossible.) If "belay from the body" only signifies where you attach the belay device (your harness vs the fixed anchor) - the choice is mostly a matter of convenience. It's usually more convenient to use the anchor (assuming you use a device that supports it); in some situations the "indoor" mode is better: 

First of all you need to control what is life threatening. Control the bleed. Lay them down and elevate the wound if necessary. Apply sterile dressings (or the closest thing you have to sterile). As it continues to bleed apply more dressings. Blood goes through a clotting process and if you pull the dressings it has to start over. Then assess the situation. Get them comfortable and warm. Give them something to drink. Ask them how they feel and if they are on medication. Clean the wound is secondary at this time. Make a long term plan. If are going to extricate and get them to a hospital in a few hours then only clean and dress if you have the materials to do it right. If it is going to be longer than 24 hours to get professional medical care then clean the best you can. If you used everything you have sterile then boil some clothes. Even if you don't have an antiseptic you have soap. You will find products call first aid antiseptic. Good old soap is better than whiskey. It not realistic to carry the volume of peroxide required to irrigate a wound in the back country. If you have a wound like that then you need to make plans to get them to a medical facility. You don't have a big rush. You are not going to have a serious infection in 48 hours. Just a cut cooking is not likely to be life threatening. Control the bleed with a dressing. Clean with soap and water. Then some antiseptic if you have it. I don't see using whiskey unless you don't even have soap. Let it dry and apply the best dressing you have. If you are out of sterile dressing then boil some clothes and hang them out to dry. An up to date first aid kit can mean a lot of stuff. Build your own and take a first aid class. American Red Cross has a wilderness first aid. Ony in the back country would you be in a situation of longer term care. No off the shelf first aid kit is going have the volume to control a major bleed and that is what is going to kill some one.
