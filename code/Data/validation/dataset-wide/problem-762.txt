There are many types of orbit around the Earth. Is there an orbit where the moon can pull an object traveling in parallel with the moon's orbit to Earth allowing the object pulled along by the moon's gravity slightly providing the force needed for the object to indefinitely sustain orbit around Earth? I'm not talking about the Lagrange points around the moon, but a distance out side of them where the moon over takes the object and as it passes it reinforcing the force needed to the object to stay in an orbit around Earth. More like a moon assisted orbit. 

Unlike Saturn's moons our moon is relatively much larger in ratio to the size of the Earth. Earth's moon's orbit is also elliptical and is at a tilt to its equator because of this would a ring last and what would the ring look like? Does the moon disrupted a defined ring from forming? This is a picture of space garbage of artificial satellites. 

Suppose I have a large thin disk of rotating gas in a galaxy -- the disk has a maximum inclination-corrected $V_{max}$ and a maximum radial extent of $R_{max}$ corresponding to that $V_{max}$ measurement. The virial theorem tells me that the total (aka dynamical) mass enclosed by that rotating disk (including stars, dark matter, etc.) is $V_{max}^2 R_{max} / G$, where $G$ is Newton's gravitational constant. Here I have assumed that the virial coefficient is 1, but the virial coefficient can vary widely based on the geometry of the problem. For example, it can be almost 10 for dwarf galaxies (an order of magnitude!), or a factor of $\sim3-5$ for dispersion-dominated rather than rotation-supported systems like elliptical galaxies where you're using the stars to probe the dynamical mass. My question is simple: for a simple rotating disk of gas as above (assume it is thin and obviously not dispersion-supported, which I think is one of the simplest possible geometries for a question like this), what is the virial coefficient? I have seen coefficients of both 1 and 2, but I have no idea which derivation is correct. Adding to the problem is that some derivations seem to be using the virial theorem to give an order of magnitude estimate which means they leave out discussion of the virial coefficient altogether. 

I read about natural gravitational eddies that travel in a wave that black holes have. They also have a strong magnetic field. Does those eddies follow magnetic field lines of the rotating black hole? Can a galaxies have their own gravitational eddies like a black hole does? 

There is an uncountable amount of stars from our perspective, but space does have a limit of size which is the distance which subatomic particle and matter as traveled since the big bang and with that limit of stars. Although stars die and form beyond our ability to count so observably we can never have an exact count of stars at anytime as well. I would bet on answer B because The universe does have a total mass of about 25 billion galaxies. We can mathematically calculate the mass of our universe. 

Astronomers always talk about astrophysical objects being in virial equilibrium (e.g., a stellar system, or a disk of gas within a galaxy, etc.). But I never hear about thermodynamical equilibrium. What are some examples of objects that are not in virial equilibrium? One example question: suppose that what you thought was a disk of rotating gas within a galaxy (as revealed by spectroscopy) is actually a bipolar outflow of gas. Would the bipolar outflow of gas be in virial equilibrium? Is a radio jet (length of hundreds of kpc) from a supermassive black hole in virial equilibrium? 

Suppose that I have an array of stellar masses of tens of thousands of galaxies, and that I also already know what the total "survey volume" is (in Mpc^3) within which all of those galaxies are contained. For context, my data is from a simulation of galaxy formation at redshift ~ 0, rather than from an observational simple -- so in principle I don't think I need to worry about incompleteness corrections at the faint (low-mass) end. Given my array of stellar masses and the total survey volume in Mpc^3, how do I create and plot the "galaxy stellar mass function" that I always see people talking about? Isn't it just basically a histogram of the stellar mass array, and then divide the # of galaxies in every bin by the survey volume (it's almost just like a normalization constant)? (Of course this question could equally apply to galaxy luminosity functions.) 

Is a orbit possible where 2 objects going in opposite directions can intersect repeatedly with minor course corrections? 

It is said that planets are continuously moving away from the sun. At one time Mars was just the right distance to support life at least temperature wise? Could Venus be far enough from the sun eventually to cool down? Related: Are planets moving away from the sun? Is Earth losing orbit? 

Has the Roche limit affect been observed having an effect on an constructed object gravitational wise to cause damage? Could the Roche limit be used to slow an object? 

Is the Earth losing or gaining distance from the sun overall? Could asteroids over time add weight to the Earth and push it farther from the sun more than having a degrading orbit around the sun? Does asteroids and space dust increase the mass the the outer planets over sustaining or pulling the Earth from the Sun? 

My question applies to gas falling in toward a galaxy from the circumgalactic or intergalactic medium, under the influence of gravity from the central galaxy itself as well as the overall dark matter halo. If there is diffuse gas uniformly distributed in a "circumgalactic halo" (assuming some mass density, temperature, and circular velocity distribution), how do I derive the timescale at which that gas will fall toward the central galaxy, as a function of galactocentric distance? Is this a simple classical mechanics gravity problem -- where you derive the "free fall" timescale of gas in different spherical/radial shells, assuming an overall external gravitational potential field? I guess this question could also apply to gas in clusters of galaxies too. Any references or textbook chapters would be greatly appreciated.
