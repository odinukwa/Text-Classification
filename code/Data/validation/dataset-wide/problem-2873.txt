One can use the information contained in a map to assist in navigational activities within the territory the map is assumed to be a reliable representation of. One can use assembly instructions for the guidance required to piece together flat packed furniture. One makes a shopping list to alleviate the need to remember and to optimise expenditure. One uses signage to help find the location of the toilets in an unfamiliar shopping precinct. One uses the step-by-step procedure in the auto workshop manual to facilitate a coolant/oil/filter change on the car. One uses a recipe to cook an unfamiliar meal- the list is endless. Generally speaking, If a representation R contains genuine and useful information about some target system E, then R can be used to ‘leverage’ (inform/guide/coordinate/instruct/organise/regulate/navigate/anticipate/prepare/etc.) one’s interactions with E (R is used to guide or correct for minor ‘cognitive deficits’ pertaining to E-interactions). If R doesn’t provide this, then R is redundant or worst impedimental. Metaphysics has no utility in this sense and I challenge anyone on this site to provide an obvious counter example that doesn’t trot out some clap trap about ‘understanding’. Pace Logical Positivism, I think the significance of what you might call “the social utility of representation” is however, hopelessly over looked. Metaphysics seems to consist in little more than a pretence to ‘reality tracking’ when the only thing that’s really going on is ‘social coordination’ among only those privileged and versed enough to occupy the upper/inner echelons (much like the Catholic church for example). Think of the notion of ‘latent vs. manifest’ function from sociology. The manifest function here would be to get a grip on what reality is and does and to have that adequately communicated amongst ones interlocutors. The latent function is to reap the residual (perlocutionary, J.L. Austin) social benefits- to get along with this philosopher (camp), make each other feel good, solidarity, trust, inclusion, etc.; or the opposite -to antagonise, show defiance, annoy, exclusion, etc., tenure, grants, publishing notoriety and so on. This ‘social’ phenomenon is rather ubiquitous. We’re all guilty of using a pretence to (or assumption of) reality tracking as a way (mode) of subserving social interaction on a quotidian basis: conversations involving putative topics, news, anecdotes, fables, hot and cold gossip, rumour/hearsay, jokes/comedy, conspiracy, propaganda, errant or extreme values, myths, superstition, religion, mysticism, spirituality, misconception, bigotry, ignorance, white lies, sub cultural norms…, much of what counts as philosophy, etc. It’s a group based (pragmatic) strategy that gets you access to all the latent goodies that come with being socially hooked up with people who are supposedly ‘on the same page’ and separated from those that aren’t. “…, a merely random groping, and, what is worst of all, a groping among mere concepts.”- Immanuel Kant, (Critique of Pure reason). 

The problem: "Since the brain in a vat gives and receives exactly the same impulses as it would if it were in a skull, and since these are its only way of interacting with its environment, then it is not possible to tell, from the perspective of that brain, whether it is in a skull or a vat"(from wikipedia) So, to just use the example of an eye connected to a brain, the eyes receives light, which is then transmitted to the brain. The skeptic would say how do you know you are actually seeing things with your eye, and its not just transmissions directly to the brain. My "solution" would be to imagine what type of machine could "fake" the transmissions to the brain without actually seeing. This machine must be cabale of causing the specific "transmissions" (whatever those are) that produce phenomenal visual experience to go to the brain. These transmissions cannot be uncaused, but in order for them to create the specific illusion of visual perception in the brain, the causes would have to be identical to those that are normally produced by the eyes photo receptors. Therefore, in order to create an illusion of reality, the machine would have to be identical in causal function to an actual eye, but it that case there would be no illusion, but just actually seeing (with some sort of cyborg eye machine). Does this make sense and is it a legitimate solution? I have also tried to explain what I mean more clearly in comments. 

If we apply Russell’s theory of (definite) descriptions (“On Denoting” 1905) to the sentence “God is subject to logic”, it can be analysed into a conjunction of the following three: 

Consider the following: S1: The assumption that “the chair has certain affordances (weathered, rickety, sturdy, available, etc.)” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity (sitting, avoiding sitting, using as an improvised ladder/a shelf, hanging my coat, burning for heat, etc.) that couples an agent x to the (chair). S2: The assumption that “the patient has advanced artery disease” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity (the administration of statin, nitro-glycerine, ACE inhibitors, advice about radical dietary changes, etc.) that couples the surgeon x to the (patient’s heart/cardiovascular system). S3: The assumption that “consciousness has the property P (physicality, non-physicality, non- localness, universally distributed, etc.)” is a non-arbitrary subroutine in an operant or respondent activity that couples an agent x to the (phenomena of consciousness). There’s obviously nothing controversial about S1 and S2. But, the glaring issue about S3 is precisely what ‘activity’ or ‘operation’ are we talking about here? What is it that you couldn’t actually do (and not just talk about doing) if you weren’t working with the assumption that “consciousness has whatever property P”? 

I saw a flyer for a talk about this on a college campus. I am thinking of hate speech as specific names that are intended to harm. Initially, there has to be a motivation for making hate speech. So, the existence of A motivates hate in B. B therefore tries to satisfy their hatred by harming A (by calling them a name) A retaliates by trying to harm B (through some sort of punishment for hate speech) B objects to A retaliating (appealing to freedom of speech) A objects to B objecting to A retaliating B objects to A objecting to B Objecting to A retaliating etc. So it seems like there really isn't a debate but instead some sort of struggle for something impossible, which would be to harm another person without them retaliating. Each side thinks their harm is a form of justice and therefore any retaliation would be disturbing the just order and would therefore require another harm, and this would go on forever. What would be the solution here? 

Almost all religions observed that life is a suffering and provided means to end the human suffering by doing some prayer or penance. Most philosophers also ,I guess, recognize that life is a suffering. However from philosophical point of view , have we come up with a theory to end human suffering other than by taking drugs or medicines? 

In any computational environment(digital,neural,analog or quantum mechanical) is it possible to write or construct a program which can be construed as free will? 

We are free people. Why are we free ? Because we have not committed any crime. And what do you call a person who has not committed any crime ? Innocent. Therefore by default we are all innocent unless proven otherwise. 

Based on the nature of existence we find that it is only possible to define absolute Truths on a plane of perpetual existence. To illustrate my point of view ,suppose that I observe a cemetery,and I say I found a Truth that there is a cemetery. However due to nature of existence that true statement may only have a finite lifespan because observation of cemetery might turn out to be just a dream or dream like. That true statement might just turn out to be a lie. So my question are : 1.According to philosophy , what is the definition of Truth? 2.Is there an Absolute Truth? (a true statement which will always remain true independent of the nature of existence) I have taken no formal education in philosophy so please edit the question if it needs to rephrased. 

I think this goes back as far as Russell and his theory of definite descriptions (“On Denoting” 1905) which in part tried to deal with non-existent entities and to preserve the law of the excluded middle (vis. statements about non-existent entities seem to be neither true of false). If you have a concept to which nothing existent corresponds then that concepts extension is said to be the null set. So the extension of the concepts ghost and werewolves are equivalent- they are both “non-differentiable” members of the same null set. 

there is an x such that x is the creator of the universe: ∃x[CU(x)] for any x and y, if x is the creator of the universe and y is the creator of the universe, then x=y (i.e. there is at most one thing which is the creator of the universe): ∀x∀y[[CU(x) & CU(y)] → y=x] for every x that is the creator of the universe, x is subject to logic: ∀x[CU(x) → SL(x)]. More briefly put, the claim is that "God is subject to logic" says that some x is such that x is the creator of the universe, and that any y is the creator of the universe only if y = x, and that x is subject to logic: ∃x[CU(x) & ∀y[CU(y) → y=x] & SL(x)] 

I think you are missing the point of epiphenominalism, or I don't understand it, or I misunderstood you. As I understand it, epiphenomenalism means that our phenomenal experiences are caused by nothing and therefore cause nothing. nothing causes phenomenal experiences or consciousness, and consciousness cannot cause anything. The world is "causally closed" meaning that the physical can only effect the physical. physical causes are "un-grounded", meaning they happen for no reason and there is not first cause. The example you gave of humans causing changes in the world are not physical. They can be traced back to the intentions of a person and therefore are "grounded". I think your objection to phenomenalism would go away if you did not confuse these two different meanings of the word "cause". For example, a person can decide to do something and "cause" their limbs to move as an action, but they cant "cause" their body to rotate around the earth or move through space. Causes of the first type are considered "epiphenonmenon" since they are concurrent with physical causes but have no effect on them. It is just useful to use the "intentional idiom" as causes because it allows for better prediction of human behavior. physical causes however are not limited to human actions and behavior. 

Recently I decided to give up my religion. However I am confused which philosophy or philosopher should I follow to guide me in my life. I assume philosophy is mature and capable of replacing religion as there are many mature Atheists like Richard Dawkins etc. My question is : As an Atheist which philosopher or philosophy should I follow to help me grow in the world ? 

The elctro-magnetism works fine. Gravity works fine. The two theories can live separately. At atomic scale the electromagnetism theory can be employed and at large scale gravity can be employed. My question is why are we trying to unite the theory of electromagnetism and theory of gravity into one Unified theory ? What is the philosophical reason behind it? 

According to philosophy ,what is a phenomenon ? And does that definition include mental phenomenons as well? Lastly , is there anything which is not a phenomenon?
