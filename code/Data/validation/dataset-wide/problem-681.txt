Ken should ride his 60 km all-out ride, and then Barby can join him for relaxed 20 km warm-down ride together. I think both will be happy. Don't forget eat some fuels. 

I'm using Timbuk2 messenger bag for couple years now in DC area sweaty climate and very happy with it. It built for last and have lot of special commuter features making it best commuter bug I can find for myself. You can order custom colors and features also. 

It's most likely is a loose pedal bolt. Check it first. Worst case you have a problem in the bottom bracket. Check this vieo. It's very educational. 

Probably any wired cyclocomputer with cadence will have rear wheel sensor near crank. I had Blackburn Delphi 3.0 Wired Bike Computer with Cadence. This was not the best cyclocomputer, but at least it's that you asking for. 

On the morning of triathlon competition, when sun comes up and air became hotter, you'll hear blowing tire every several minutes over racks with couple thousand bikes. So, if you don't want surprise in the race day, you can use dry nitrogen or even dry air for tires. Last year my tire blew up on the hot intersection on red light also. I don't think if there any performance advantage using it. 

I agree with the tips jimirings has stated, but if possible I would sell the Rockhopper and pick up a second hand jump bike - they're simpler bikes and park oriented ones rarely see the outdoors so tend to be in a better condition than their dirt brethren. The Rockhopper's geometry is wholly unsuitable for street/park riding, it's too tall, designed for 100mm forks, and has long chainstays; which all adds up to bike that doesn't want to bunny hop and struggles to to be 360-ed. It is designed for a completely different use and environment. And I say this with experience, I used to own one, and I also tried converting my sisters to a street style - absolute failure. 

You will also need to make sure the eye-to-eye length is same as your current shock (that's the distance from the centre of the pivot hole in one end to the pivot centre in the other), and that the stroke length is the same. If either of these is wrong, it will change your bikes geometry and possibly even cause the rear tyre to bottom out against the seat tube. 

I doubt you will find a way to do this; it would require a shoe with a pretty deep sole to recess the cleats into (that's what SPDs do). Note that the SPD-SLs are pretty similar to the Looks but much more walkable. 

Hand-shift the bike onto a big cog on the rear by pressing on the derailleur as you spin the pedals. Tie the cable around the front cable stay on the downtube. Adjust as necessary to get the bike to hold a gear. 

Since it's on the inside of your thighs, it's a good bet that our seat is too wide, or not properly adjusted. A chamois crème will help, but I think the saddle change is a better idea. 

You will not lose climbing strength if you work on your cadence; they are two different aspects of riding. My recommendation to increase cadence range is the following: 1) On a slight incline, choose a gear that is medium effort. 2) Over 30 seconds, increase your cadence until you are at your maximum smooth cadence (no bouncing). If your effort is too light, you need a higher gear; if it's too hard, you need a lower gear. 3) Hold for 30 seconds 4) Slow your cadence down for 30 seconds. Repeat three times. Do this once a week. This is primarily a neuromuscular exercise, so you don't need to do this too much. 

As someone who has given numerous dérailleurs smacks against rocks, which were light enough impacts to just be able to bend the cage back, but strong enough to split the jockey wheel - I'd say yes! 

Stripping down the frame and regreasing the pivots won't do any harm, but certainly isn't necessary - I find it just makes getting the bearings out easier when they need replacing. Admittedly, after a wash I put a few drips of thick 3-in-1 oil inbetween each pivot - truthfully I have no idea if this does anything, but it probably stops water sitting in the bearing cavities for long periods. As for any other sealed bearing do not spray GT85, WD40, or any other water displacing fluid into them. They come pre-greased, and if the seal fails, it needs replacing. 

I would say the rear hub's freehub is damaged. Pop it off the hub body and inspect where the pawls are (mind the pawl springs don't ping out!), look for broken pawls and/or mashed ratchet teeth (the teeth which the pawls engage with). Post some pictures of it if you are unsure. 

Is the cleat tight on the shoe? If it can rotate at all, you won't be able to clip out. Are you rotating your foot outwards to unclip? When I first got my clipless I tried to rotate in, and that doesn't work too well. 

It's fairly simple; to stop effectively, you need to apply the two controls in a different manner. When you start braking, you have a given amount of weight on the front and rear wheels. As you apply the brakes, the deceleration shifts weight from the rear wheels to the front wheels, which gives more traction at the front, and less traction at the rear. More traction at the front means that you can apply the brakes more there, less traction at the rear means that you need to reduce the power on the rear brake. When I used to teach motorcycle safety, we would say "progressive squeeze on the front brake, light to lighter pressure on the rear". 

Well, the simple answer is that aerobars aren't very helpful unless you are riding at reasonable speed (say, >18MPH or so), but most people who ride at that speed would prefer to ride in a paceline, which gives more benefit than aerobars. Aerobars are unsafe in pacelines because riders cannot maneuver as well as being on the drop bars. 

It's pretty unlikely that anyone keeps a list of weights for all the available tyres by width. Your best idea is to download the datasheets of brands/models you consider good enough (quality wise) and then compare the weights. 

Just to add to the other answers: There are special tools, but they're just plastic wedges, so a flat blade screwdriver is fine. 

According to Boca, they are 3/16" for the front and 1/4" for the rear. I see no reason why you can't run ceramic bearings in them. 

The bad news $200 won't get a new fork much better than the one you have now. The good news The second-hand market is full of a couple of year old forks that were originally twice that. Do your research Forks may look frighteningly full of tech, but they are designed to be serviced so the delicate parts are inside cartridges that can safely be removed. So if you see a fork you like on eBay for example, go to the manufacturers website and look at the servicing instructions - it will make your second-hand fork feel new again and only for the cost of new seals and some fork fluid (~$30). Play it safe 

MTBR.com does a big review of lights every year; here is the one for 2015. They have a ton of useful information. 

I've run Rubino Pros for a few years. They aren't the lightest or fastest tire around, but they last very well and are pretty flat proof for my area (Seattle). 

Carbon fiber is strong. Really strong. The kinds of loads that your frame sees when you hit a pothole is far bigger than what you would get sitting on the bike. 

For a given person at a given point in time, it is possible to determine what you are asking experimentally; for example, a runner can, over time, figure out their speed for different time periods. 

There are lots of different field tests approaches. I've been using the Carmichael one (two 9-minute full out TTs with a cooldown between them). 

The difference between 28 and 30 is only about 8%. If you climbed a hill at 70 RPM on a 28, you would only be riding at 75% on a 30, and your force would only go down a little bit. 

Personally I don't think there is general right or wrong answer, every situation is different. The above is just my take on what you have written. 

You turn it on when riding on smooth surfaces or going up hill to improve pedal efficiency. It's hard to know if you will need it in advance because without riding the bike you won't know how well the suspension design handles pedal bob (the energy lost by the bike suspension compressing under pedal forces), try and get a test ride. 

The same way you would for any paint: find a swatch that matches it, or chip a bit off the bike, and then take it to a paint store and ask them to match it for you. If it's a modern bike of a decent manufacturer you could always drop them an email, and they might be able to give you the make and model of the actual paint they use. Also remember you will have to lacquer it afterwards, and that has an impact on it's final look. 

Most MTB frame styles have roughly the same BB height, as everyone wants a better cornering bike and it's difficult to pedal over rough terrain anyway. The only exception I think of are pure downhilling frames, where a very low BB height is desired but to minimise pedal smashes, shorter crank lengths are the norm. Headangles tend to quite steep on most MTB frames even on very different styles, for example XC and dirt jump frames have similar headtube angles. Once again the notable exception are downhilling frames, which have very slack headangles; although this for improving stability when on steep descents (it's harder to go over the bars). The above is an oversimplification. In the real world the parts play off each other, and their characteristics will change as a bike moves through the rear travel (if it's got any of course). Also the above are frame characteristics; the length of stem, width of the bars, length of cranks, height of forks, etc. all play their part in the overall feel just as much as the frame does. 

Your options to reduce the force on your knees are to reduce bike + rider weight or get lower gearing. If you have a standard road bike cassette, there are climbing cassettes that will reduce the gearing slightly (around 10% or so). Is it dangerous to your knees? Well, that depends on your personal physiology, how much force you are pushing, how much to you have trained for this, and how well your bike fits you. If you can do this without your knees hurting, you are probably fine. You might also consider standing up; this changes the mechanics a bit and mixes things up. When you stand up, make sure you slow down or you will spike your heart rate. Welcome to the steeps! 

There likely isn't much difference in performance. Some people do find that SPD cleats lead to "hot spots" (painful spots) on the balls of the feet; that's why I went to SPD-SLs. You might find a difference in platform height; IIRC the height of the SPD cleats + pedals is shorter than the SPD-SL. You'd want to adjust your seat height to deal with that. 

Actually, the latest fashion in road bike building do use the V-brakes mostly for aerodynamic reasons. For example $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

I would recommend the normal tire pressure, because lower pressure cause unneeded vibrations, noise, tire slips over the trainer, tire excessive wear, and also different resistance if you using speedometer as a powermeter. 

[Light Trails – Fully LED’ed] $URL$ As a driver I've found passive/reflexive strips totally useless in the dangerous situations on the road. Unfortunately it's not working if cyclist out of the car beams. It makes him/her completely dark and invisible in contrast to the objects highlighted by car front lights. Especially reflexive strips danger because cyclist usually have no idea if he/her visible or not. I found this video very interesting as example of using active lighting. It shows not only the presence of the some unknown source of red light blinking but the actual size and contour of the cyclist and his bicycle. 

The aerodynamic is not the only the issue in the road race bike. The most of the time in the road race the racers ride inside the peloton protected from head wind and have no aerodynamic problem at all. Moreover, at the mountain parts of the race aerodynamic plays no role in the race, but weight and stiffness of the frame do. You can find the TdF racers used light low profile non-aerodynamic rims on the mountain stages. The road race bike is a compromise of the many problems, where aerodynamics is not the most important. 

You seem to be forgetting the second-hand market, a grand can get you a fantastic 2-3yr old bike of any variety. If it was my money, I would much rather have a 2yr old bike that was worth £2.5K new, than a £1K new bike. Paint scratches don't affect the ride. 

You should set the preload to to give the correct amount of sag on the fork when you are sat on it (usually 20-30%) - and then there shouldn't be a reason to touch it again (unless your weight changes dramatically of course). Now if your forks feel hard, it means the compression is too high. Your fork's damping cartridge has an 'Absolute+' feature which means you have a 5-position knob on the top of one of the legs which allows you to tweak it somewhat. 

Firstly clean all the metal bits floating about the BB from the threads being cut. You can usually just look at the state of the threads at this point to see how bad the damage is. Your eyes should be able to follow the grooves around uninterrupted, if you can wind the BB back in OK, and it tightens as normal then you should be fine. Because the force a BB is subjected to is perpendicular to the thread direction, the chance of it pulling out is very slim. If you ever do truly annihilate your BB threads (remember cross threading is a pretty common issue in engineering), you could probably get an engineering works to drill out the existing thread, press a steel shim into the BB tube, and then thread that. I've seen it done on smaller fittings, so I don't why it wouldn't apply to larger ones.
