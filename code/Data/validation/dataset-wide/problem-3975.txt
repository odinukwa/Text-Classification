One can associate a graph to a monomial in these generators, with vertices $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ and an edge between $i$ and $j$ if $\omega_{ij}$ occurs in the monomial. The relations imply that the monomial is zero unless this graph is a forest. The top degree $H^{k(d-1)}(F(\mathbf R^d,k))$ is spanned by monomials such that the corresponding graph is a tree. One can interpret such a monomial as a bracketing of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$: if $d$ is odd then the second and third relation correspond to anticommutativity and Jacobi identity for this bracketing, so the $S_k$-representation is given by the space $\mathrm{Lie}(k)$ spanned by Lie words on $k$ letters, and if $d$ is even we get instead $\mathrm{Lie}(k) \otimes \mathrm{sgn}_k$. In lower degrees we get instead a sum over partitions of $\{1,\ldots,k\}$, and for each block $B$ in the partition a monomial such that the corresponding graph is a tree on the vertex set $B$. This tells us that we are considering a plethysm of symmetric functions. Let $\widehat\Lambda$ be the degree completion of the ring of symmetric functions in infinitely many variables and let $\widehat\Lambda[[t]]$ be the power series ring in one variable over it. If $V$ is a representation of $S_k$, let $\mathrm{ch}_k(V)$ be the corresponding degree $k$ symmetric function. Define $$ C = \sum_{k \geq 0} h_k \in \widehat\Lambda,$$ the sum of the trivial representation in each arity. Let $$ L_d = \begin{cases} \sum_{k \geq 0} \mathrm{ch}_k \mathrm{Lie}(k) \otimes \mathrm{sgn}_k t^{k(d-1)} \in \widehat \Lambda [[t]] & d \text{ even} \\ \sum_{k \geq 0} \mathrm{ch}_k \mathrm{Lie}(k) t^{k(d-1)} \in \widehat \Lambda [[t]] & d \text{ odd} \end{cases}$$ Then $$ \sum_{k \geq 0} \sum_{i \geq 0} t^i \mathrm{ch}_k H^i(F(\mathbf R^d,k)) = C \circ L_d.$$ The plethysm here satisfies $p_n \circ f(t,p_1,p_2,\ldots) = f(t^n,p_n,p_{2n},\ldots)$. You can also write this plethysm in terms of an infinite product or the "plethystic exponential", like Getzler does. One can describe $\mathrm{ch}_k\mathrm{Lie}(k)$ explicitly in terms of symmetric functions, and Getzler is using this in his paper. Namely, there is an isomorphism $\mathrm{Lie}(k) = \mathrm{Ind}_{C_k}^{S_k} \chi$ where $\chi$ is a primitive character of the cyclic group on $k$ elements, and $$ \mathrm{Ind}_{C_k}^{S_k} \chi = \frac 1 k \sum_{{d \mid k}} \mu(d)p_k^{k/d}.$$ Lurking in the background is an operadic perspective. The operad $e_d$ is given by the homology of the little $d$-dimensional disks and what we are trying to do is calculate the characteristic of this operad. The operad $e_d$ can be constructed as the product of the commutative operad and a $(d-1)$-fold suspension of the Lie operad by a distributive law. This tells us that the characteristic of $e_d$ is the plethysm of the characteristic of $\mathrm{Com}$ (which is $C$) and the characteristic of this $(d-1)$-fold suspension, which is $L_d$. 

Yes it commutes. To prove this you should express the map $(\phi/S)^\ast$ in "six functors" language. All functors below are derived. What's needed is that $\newcommand{\Q}{\mathbf Q_\ell} \renewcommand{\S}{\mathrm{pt}}\Q$ is pulled back from $\S = \mathrm{Spec}(k)$. Then $$ g_{X/S,\ast} \Q= g_{X/S,\ast}g_{X/\S}^\ast \Q = g_{Y/S,\ast}\phi_\ast\phi^\ast g_{Y/\S}^\ast \Q $$ which receives a map from $g_{Y/S,\ast}g_{Y/\S}^\ast \Q$ because of the unit of the adjunction $1 \to \phi_\ast\phi^\ast$. This map is exactly $(\phi/S)^\ast$. If we express $(\phi/S')^\ast$ in the same way and apply $f_\ast$ then we get the equality you want, precisely because $S \to S'$ is a map of $k$-schemes. 

But the map $Y_1(7)^\circ \to \mathcal{M}_{1,1}^\circ$ is representable, and this means in particular that the fiber category over $\text{Spec }k$ (or over any scheme for that matter) is an algebraic space, not a stack. So the only isomorphisms in your 48-object category are identities, and the "scheme theoretic fiber" should have degree 48 over $\text{Spec }k$. 

As an algebraic geometer, here is how I would describe the correspondence between spin structures on E and H1(E,Z2). While this might not be what you're looking for, maybe it still helps to see another perspective. 

Has anyone defined what it means for a modular operad to be Koszul, or what the Koszul dual of a modular operad is? In particular, is it meaningful to say that a modular operad is quadratic? Merkulov, Markl and Shadrin (Wheeled PROPs, graph complexes and the master equation) give a definition for wheeled properads, which are basically modular operads with oriented edges, which are constrained to have at most one output. Presumable the role of bar-cobar duality is then played by the Feynman transform and the dual Feynman transform. 

I find it dubious that anyone here will get better at choosing titles for their papers by reading these examples. Nevertheless, I like the title "The homotopy category is a homotopy category" by Arne Strøm. I also like the very apt title "$\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{22}$ is of general type" by Gavril Farkas. The paper starts like this: The aim of this paper is to prove the following result: Theorem: The moduli space of curves of genus 22 is of general type. 

The name you are looking for is that of a torsor or principal homogeneous space. For any sets $X$ and $Y$, the set of bijections $X \to Y$ is a torsor for the group $\mathrm{Sym}(X)$ acting on the right as well as the group $\mathrm{Sym}(Y)$ acting on the left. In your case, the set $\Phi$ is a torsor for the abelian group you constructed. 

Here's an example: Take $\mathbb C^2$ minus the origin and identify the points $(1,1)$ and $(-1,-1)$ and let this be $X$. Then $G=\mathbb Z/2$ acts by $(x,y) \mapsto (-x,-y)$ and the quotient is smooth, but $X$ is not Cohen-Macauley (two planes intersecting in a point is not Cohen-Macaulay). The quotient map is not flat either, since a finite morphism with smooth target is flat iff the source is CM. 

The sets of trees being summed over are not actually different, that's the thing. Let me try to explain it without introducing a notational mess, and hopefully the idea will be clear. Nonsymmetric cyclic operads are built out of trees equipped with an isotopy class of embedding into the plane. In the free nonsymmetric cyclic operad (equivalently, in the bar construction on a cyclic operad), one forms a sum over all such trees that map down to a given one-vertex tree (a.k.a. corolla) when contracting all internal edges. Usual nonsymmetric operads are built out of rooted trees equipped with an isotopy class of embedding into the plane, i.e. one of the legs of the trees is marked as "outgoing". In the free nonsymmetric operad, one forms a sum over all such trees that map down to a given rooted corolla when contracting all internal edges. Now observe that the operation of contracting all internal edges induces a bijection between the legs of the tree and the legs of the resulting corolla. So choosing one of the legs as "outgoing" on the tree is equivalent to making such a choice on the corolla. It follows that the sets of trees being summed over are actually in canonical bijection with each other; the bijection is given by "forgetting which leg is outgoing". In particular the chain complexes in the bar constructions are canonically isomorphic. The "forgetting which leg is outgoing" operation on trees induces the forgetful functor from nonsymmetric cyclic operads to nonsymmetric operads: thus if $P$ is a nonsymmetric cyclic operad, $F$ denotes the forgetful functor from nonsymmetric cyclic operads to nonsymmetric operads, and $B^{cyc}$ resp. $B^{ns}$ denote the two bar constructions, then $F(B^{cyc}(P))$ and $B^{ns}(F(P))$ are canonically isomorphic. Everything above is true mutatis mutandis for cyclic symmetric operads vs usual symmetric operads. 

I also heard a version of Wick's theorem at a talk of Rahul Pandharipandhe about two months ago, which I will not be able to state correctly here since I can't really make sense of my notes. In that version of Wick's theorem one studied an $n$-fold product of a variety with itself by interpreting it as a configuration space of $n$ "particles" moving on the variety. The goal was to simplify certain complicated products of cohomology classes given by diagonals (= particles coinciding) and Chern classes of the tangent/cotangent bundle at one of the "particles". This was all done pictorially, and one represented the diagonals as a line connecting the two points, which at least shows some connection with the Wick formalism since I think I have at one point seen these lines between particles also in the context of Feynman diagrams. Can someone give a hint about how these Wick theorems fit together? 

The universal property isn't a characterization of $C \boxtimes D$, per se: the universal property is a property of the pair $(C \boxtimes D, \boxtimes)$ as an object of the coslice 2-category whose objects are pairs consisting of a category $B$ and a functor $C \times D \to B$. Now, $\mathsf{Vec}$ and $\mathsf{sVec}$ are equivalent just as categories, but there's no way to make them equivalent in this coslice 2-category (being equivalent here is a stronger condition). Does this help? 

Q1 + Q2: At present the Chow motives known to be finite dimensional are precisely those that are contained in the thick tensor subcategory generated by motives of abelian varieties. That is, the motives that can be obtained from motives of abelian varieties by tensorial operations, extensions, quotients and subobjects. Q3. This is definitely not known at all! Any projective variety is a finite cover of a projective space, and $h(\mathbb P^n)$ is of course finite dimensional. That said, there is recent dramatic progress in this area. According to a preprint of Ayoub ("Topologie feuilletée et conservativité des réalisations classiques en caractéristique nulle", available on his webpage), the conservativity conjecture in characteristic zero may be within reach (but see the disclaimers in his preprint). This would in particular imply finite dimensionality for all Chow motives which have only even or odd cohomology. 

One thing that should be made more precise is whether you are asking that the automorphism group equals $C_2 \times A_4$ or if it is enough that it contains $C_2 \times A_4$. I'm assuming you mean the former. Then it seems that the answer is no. In the paper "The locus of curves with prescribed automorphism group" (K. Magaard, T. Shaska, S. Shpectorov, H. Voelklein, $URL$ one finds a classification of loci in the moduli space $M_g$ of curves with "large" automorphism group for small genus, meaning that the order of the automorphism group is at least $4(g-1)$. In this classification we see that there is a unique 1-dimensional family in $M_5$ of curves with full automorphism group $C_2 \times A_4$. By combining with the results of "Some special families of hyperelliptic curves" (T. Shaska, $URL$ it seems that all those are hyperelliptic. PS - I remember that there is an error in one of the tables in the paper of Kuribayashi and Kimura referenced by Igor Rivin - proceed with caution. 

I also noticed this at some point. I think you are right. One reference where this assumption is explicitly spelled out is the paper of Getzler and Jones. 

Yes, absolutely. There is an equivalence of categories between étale covers of $X$ of degree $n$, and $S_n$-torsors over $X$. The general principle here is that $H^1(X,\mathscr G)$, where $X$ is some site and $\mathscr G$ is a sheaf of groups, classifies locally trivial things over $X$ whose sheaf of automorphisms is given by $\mathscr G$. This includes facts like that $H^1(X,\mathcal O_X^\ast)$ classifies line bundles (since an automorphism of a line bundle is given by multiplication by a nonzero scalar on each fibre), or that $H^1(X,\mathcal T_X)$ classifies first order deformations when $X$ is smooth (since deformations of smooth $X$ are locally trivial, and an automorphism of a first order deformation is an infinitesimal automorphism which is a vector field). In your case, the statement follows because both étale covers of degree $n$ and $S_n$-torsors have $\underline{S_n}$ as sheaf of automorphisms. A more concrete way of seeing this particular case is the following. Given a finite étale cover $Y \to X$, form the $n$-fold fibered product $Y \times_X \cdots \times_X Y \to X$ and remove the "big diagonal". Given an $S_n$-torsor $P \to X$, form the quotient $P/S_{n-1} \to X$. These constructions are inverse to each other.
