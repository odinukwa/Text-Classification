I'm going to try and answer generically. You can apply this to your own bike. A mudguard/fender has one main task, to stop water and muck from transferring from the tyre/tire to the bike and the rider. ROAD So, the best-performing mudguards you can buy will be "full" ones, something like this: 

Free stuff - start with your bike fit. Make sure your saddle height is high enough, but not so high your hips wiggle while pedalling. Check brakes for rub - adjust brakes or true wheel if required. Carry less stuff - wear fewer clothes when riding. Roadies tend to avoid big flapping jackets, and their clothes are more close-fitting. Carry the right stuff - Water and some fuel is useful. A small thing like a lolly or a square of chocolate or a gel per hour of riding works for me for up to 3 hour rides, after that I need a more solid snack like a muesli bar or bliss balls. Lock out any suspension on the road. Bobbing along slowly saps your power. If there is no lockout, then some bikes have tuneable suspension, so you can make them more firmer and loose less power. Downside is you still have to drag the useless suspension parts around with you, as excess weight. Technique - look closely at others and see if you can observe differences between your technique and theirs. Ride straight, but defensively - I see a lot of slower riders wiggling in and out of parked cars in the stationary lane. Turning reduces your forward speed, and ducking in between cars for a few metres is dangerous. So take a position on the road and ride in a straight line. Wear high vis colours and so on, but be perceptive to your surroundings in front and behind. I found the faster I go the further away from the kerb/curb I want to be. Be a door's width from parked cars. Ride with lights, even DRLs in the daytime. Then a service - clean/lube your chain, clean your cassette, check wheel and BB axles for play/wobble. If you can do this yourself its free, otherwise its a service cost at the LBS. 

Your bike is 25 years old, and as such it will be a product of its time. The fork will not have mountings for disk calipers, so you're up for welding some on, or replacing the fork. If you weld, hopefully its a rigid fork because welding anything onto a suspension fork is incredibly hard, plus the risk of damaging the suspension. Replacing the fork is easier, but you're going to need a 1" threaded MTB fork with disk mounts. If all the other parts swap over unmodified, you're very lucky. Do you have any emotional attachment to the old canoodle ? Modifying it can be a bad idea and spoil your connection with the old bike. I suggest you price up a new fork, wheel, caliper (both cable and hydraulic) rotor and see what the total parts cost is for both sorts. Then go try some new bikes in a real shop, and calculate the difference in price. You can even subtract whatever you'd get for selling the old bike, or revel in becoming a cyclist whose N value is now 2. Just remember rule 12 ($URL$ If you can get the parts for nothing, then by all means its a good project. However it'll never be modern - instead its mutton dressed as lamb. 

There is only one way to check the quality of a weld, and that's an ultrasonic scan. These tests would be routinely used for aerospace welds before commissioning. This would not be done on a bike, unless its super-expensive lightweight where the welder would be balancing weight and strength. More info $URL$ A Fuji frame is not a low-end bike - depending on model its medium or higher. So the build process is going to be much better than a cheap BSO. As for something you can do - clean the welded area, get a strong light and a magnifier/jewellers loupe, and eyeball every part of it. You're looking for cracks, discolourations, or chips. 

Regional services may have smaller limits. If your package is still too big, its possible to send by cargo, but it likely won't go on the same aircraft as your seat, and you may have to go pick it up at a hanger elsewhere on the airport site. Number of checked bags permitted varies with the ticket purchased. Some tickets include 0 checked bags and are carry-on only, right through to 3 checked bags. 

Nobody has mentioned stolen bikes. If a non-cyclist has a bike that they are selling cheap or giving away, then use your common sense. Receiving stolen goods is a crime in most locations around the world. These aren't absolutes, but signs that a bike might be stolen: 

It could work, but you'll end up with unsightly cable ties or something to hold the housing to the frame. Plus the shifting performance won't be great given all the slop that can accrue in a long unsupported housing. If you're fixed on this frame, how about getting an opinion from a local bike shop or frame builder, as to whether they can braze on some... "braze-ons" That was how the extras were fastened on in the early days. Of course all this comes at a direct cost to your wallet. Price this against an internally-geared hub like the nexus and make a decision based on price. Or learn to ride a single speed and save. 

Answering the other part of your question - Yes you could take the electric bits off and use it as a normal bike. You'll want to take some links out of the chain to account for the skipped/missing motor drive cog. Depending on the rear dropouts you may be able to tension the chain using the parts of the motor drive, or if they come completely off then by adjusting the rear dropouts. You might elect to remove all the electronics from the handlebars. This would be pretty terminal for restoring ebike functions later, unless you can unwire it rather than chopping the wires. The battery fitting should be removed, it will likely give you access to the mounts for a drink bottle cage. Recycle the bits, or list them on ebay. Someone may want it for the battery alone, or spares for their ebike. Why castrate your ebike? Your bike will be lighter than with the motor. It will not perform as well as a non-electric bike because its likely built a bit heavier, especially around the motor mounting points. Why not? If you ever want to restore ebike functionality, all this would need to go back on the bike. You bought an ebike because you wanted an ebike, and it would be a shame to go back to a normal bike. IE you get slower and much sweatier! Delay If you don't use the battery for a while, it will loose capacity. Lithium batteries are a lot better, but leave it untouched fr a year and it will have so little capacity its junk. You should look at charging the battery every two months, especially because its not used. Do let us know what you end up doing... SE Bicycles doesn't have a lot of info in ebikes, and they are a growing sector of cycling. 

Finally if you'd rather make your own way, here's the "heatmap" for the area. You can access this at $URL$ 

I've generally shoved both levers at once when shifting to lower gears and am out of range. The front and back mechs are unrelated on normal bikes (excluding any fancy-pants electric shifting) For example, If I've ended up in big-big, then stabbing both underlevers once would move me 

Here's my home-made dropper which was finished today. This question provided the motivation to get on with it. More photos are found at $URL$ 

Being clipped in makes it slower to get your feet off the pedals, in situations where you might want to dab on the ground. Its still possible, but you have to anticipate the need more. On the other hand, being attached to the bike lets you move it around when in the air, so preparing for a landing. Toe clips on the pedals are stupid and you should avoid them - they have a bad habit of catching things if your foot is not in them properly. The other option is pedals with little grip teeth and shoes that have a suitable tread pattern. Personally I've never ridden with these. Sadly noone can tell you what will work best for you. If you have a friend with pedals you'd like to try, ask to borrow their bike for a ride. Or swapping pedals is relatively easy and only requires one tool. Most bikes have a 9/16" thread and a pedal swap takes ~5 minutes. Or buy some cheap ones on ebay for a test. You can always sell them onwards if you don't like them.
