Answering my own question after some research. Immediately after we get up from sleep and just before we fall asleep the mind is in a different state of being than the usual day state. So we can utilize this state of mind to do deeper into meditation and make huge progress. The answer is do Samatha meditation with or without sitting. Try consciously and with lot of efforts not to have any thoughts at all. Try to be as aware as possible. Stay aware and mindful. 

OM is basically associated with Shaivya tradition of Hinduism i.e. those hindus who worship Shiva. And according to hindu mythology Shiva's abode is Kailash mountain which is in tibet. So inhabitants of that part of Tibet were using the word AUM or OM either for purpose of meditation or as ordinary word to mean Consciousness. Hinduism was mostly rooted in Afaganistan, Pakistan and the Gangaitic plains of India during ancient time. With this line of reasoning there is a heavy possibility that Hindus themselves adopted OM from Tibeteans. OM is not used by Theravadins only by Vajrayana Buddhists and Mahayana Buddhist whose roots are in Tibet. So basically Tibetians are using it and it belongs to them. So I wont say it is imported. 

By practising the eight fold path and meditation I have been able to get over lot of suffering as a result of my past created by my mind. I am able to get over self pity, hatered, anger by following the advise of friends in this forum... But now that I am over the past my mind has started playing new game...it starts painting pictures of grandiosness...like it presents me with illusions like i will be as great as the Buddha...I will be the Buddha and have followers...i will have super powers...i can fly etc etc... Its getting difficult to control these thoughts in meditation...its a kind of hindrance I didnt read in any book... I want to attain silent present moment awareness...is there any sutta which can help me with overcoming this maya of my mind? Is there any help? 

If you are trying to learn Vipassana all by your own, in a laymans terms I will say, in the begining, even if you can concentrate say for 5 to 10 seconds on your breath or body sensation without getting distracted by thoughts, I will say, you have done progress. There is no such quantification as, How much Concentration? Ideally it should be 100%. 

I didn't practise it for a 'longer' time, but I did practise it, it didn't worked because contempletion needs active memory and we really don't have memories of revulsive aspects of bodies. Then I changed the way, I switched to looking in real world. Following are the things I saw... 

The habit of mind to Speculate and Stereotype is developed over thousand of years of psychological evolution. It was at some point in history, very important for humans to classify the objects, they saw and and hence speculation and stereotyping gave advantage, when the world around humans was not very complex. The point I am making is, these are habit patterns of mind created over thousands of past lives. As against 'jumping to conclusions', as we mean it in a judgemental sense, is some kind of recent phenomena of fast paced life. May be, even the stone age humans must have been jumping to conclusions at sight of some thing akin to snake. So, I am trying to say, these are habit patterns of everybodies mind. Now answering your question, how one trains to accept the uncertainity The point of Buddhism is not to train the mind (there are therepies in modern psychology to do just that), instead we try our best to see things as they are. So the way to dismantle the bias is, to be aware to the present moment and be watchful of your mind as much as possible. This gives rise to intelligence, and through that intelligence you dismantle the habit pattern. When you fail, don't be judgemental towards yourself and feel bad. Instead make a note and understand that as all your intelligence was available what you did was the best you can do. Through such repeated feedback your biases will be dismantled without specifically trying to train the mind which is a superficial and phony solution. To put it simply, Stay Aware to the Present Moment. 

They will change and perish so will you, so will everybody you know, your wife, your children, your parents, everything is impermanent, 'annicca'. The feeling of detachment is alright, in fact good, but dis-connection shows you lack respect and compassion. Everyone wants to tell their story to friends, share the problems and good and bad times with friends, you should have compassion. You should have listened to them without attachment. Like a lotus in a pond, be in this world but not of it. 

When you are a Buddha you live in a Choiceless Awareness. The reason Lord Buddha got inspiration to give the first sermon must be the same why Bodhidharma got inspiration to go to China. He didn't had a seperate sense of self like we do so the actions of the enlightened ones are very difficult to make sense using linear logic of causality. He could have as well sat in cave in India. So when he was asked who are you by the emperor, he said, 'I dont know'. Then what are the odds we can figure out why he left for China. Perhaps he liked the Tea, may be. 

The better thing to realize was to say, 'I am not' 'anatta'. As long as you have not realized no-self, and as long as you are you can say 'none of them are mine'. Of course, you do not possess them, so in that sense, they are not yours, but they are YOUR friends. As a householder, friendship is imperative, you cannot live in this samsara like an island, you never know when will you need whom. Although this should not be the criteria to make friends, but this is true. 

If you perform your action out of awareness, consciously aware of the present moment, then that action will be a good action if the same action will be percormed mechanically, without being aware it will be bad. If you are conscious, you will be using all your intelligence to do the action...and then again its been repeatedly pointed out in many book I have been reading that 'we humans don't have free will'. Even Ajahn Brahm says that. So if I don't have real choice of my actions how can I be held accountable for and then the question of good and bad should become irrelevant. So practise present moment awareness, what will follow will be good as it invarently be in accordance will kamma. 

I am designing an educational computer simulation to explain the Buddhist concept of Samsara. The gameplay will consist of players interacting with the simulated environment and other players. One of the concepts of the game will be if you are doing creative actions with other players or environment then your Karma points will increase and you will get more powers if you do destructive things like shoot someone with a gun, you will be reduced of Karma points. Based on them you will be transferred to different levels. This is one of my ideas I will be implementing. Can you help me with more ideas related to the Buddhist understanding of what Samsara is? This should be educational about Buddhist Samsara. 

I was also amazed when I read the accounts of Zen monks attaining enlightenment over slightest of push from the Masters. What I have understood is that, Enlightenment is not a causal phenomena, its an acausal happening. You cannot do something which leads to enlightenment. You just have to cultivate the ground for enlightenment. Once done, anything can lead to that final quantum leap. Remember its a quantum leap, its not a linear traverse. So, yes and no, you might need simply the insight of impermenance or you might need the Zen stick of a master, but you have to cultivate the soil. 

There is a Buddhist concept of Kalyāṇa-mittatā, Buddha definitely approved friendship amongst the sangha as well as for householders. As long as it was with right people (meaning friends addicted to gambling, alcohol should be avoided). Now to your dilemma, 

It really depends upon what you mean by 'Being a Buddhist'. In the book 'Buddhism plain and Simple', Steve Hagen says that the more and more I am a Buddhist (i.e. practise the Dhamma) I know that I am not a Buddhist( meaning the sense of self disappears). So by being Buddhist if you mean one who practises the Dhama as taught by Lord Buddha then 'yes', its safe to assume 'any thing about Buddhism is right'. But if by being a Buddhist you mean just a connotation, i.e. for political or socio economic reasons for e.g. you call yourself buddhist because your parents were buddhist and their parents were buddhist and entire Myanmar is buddhist and none of you are practising anything said by the Buddha...then your actions are upto your own scrutiny. The sense of religious identity is a very twisted matter. Insted of calling your self a 'Buddhist' as in this context in which you are asking the question, ask the question that, As somebody who follows the dhamma taught by the Buddha... Then the answer is yes, yes, yes... The dhamma is like a dew drop or honey sweet in the begining, sweet in the middle and sweet at the end. 

My answer is not bas3d on scriptural references but on experiences I had both in scientific community as well as religious groups. 

It seems to be a big deal that we see things as they are. When we say, 'to see things as they are' in Buddhist context, we mean to see things not clouded by ignorance, for e.g, when you see a beautiful women, you really only see a beautiful women...because at that moment your perception is clouded by desire and lust...you dont really see her as she is, for e.g. the father or brother of same women will see her differently. That is why the Buddha gave us the meditation on bodily parts...so yes its a really big deal to see things as they are... If we are merely assuming when things begin and end or change No, we are not merely assuming the begining or end or change...according to the second law if thermodynamics there is a perpetual change of entropy of the universe. Everything is in a constant state of flux, the sub-atomic particles inside the atoms are moving, the atoms inside things are moving and all things are slowly or otherwise undergoing molecular disintegration. Annicha is a universal law. The begining of things is not disernable and nor is the end. Change is discernable if you are sensitive enough, aware enough, meditative enough. then how do we ever really see things as they are? We ever really see things as they are when we get rid of the three poisions of ignorance, greed and lust. In other words by being more aware to the present moment. By following the eight fold path you gain the wisdom, then you see things as they are.
