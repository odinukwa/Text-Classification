So I’m in the middle of a bit of a recruiting mess-up: I was briefly in contact with company A about two years ago. Their HR person contacted me for a possible opportunity with them. I declined as I was not actively looking at that point. I since forgot about the conversation. Recruiter #1 approached me about ten days ago through LinkedIn. We had a Skype call. He seemed nice overall, however I noticed a strong interest to know about companies I applied to already (allegedly so he could better tailor the companies he offers to put me in contact with). I politely declined to disclose details about my other application processes. He then suggested company A (see above) and company B. I found both interesting, so I agreed he forward my CV to them. About a week later, Recruiter #2 contacted me. He suggested company A, C and D to me. I declined company A, citing I was already in touch with them (or so I thought) through another recruiter and agreed he forward my details to company C and D. Keep in mind that I had still not remembered that I had been in touch with company A two years ago. Yesterday, I received emails from company A’s HR person and Recruiter #2, almost in the same minute: The HR person just politely reminded me that we had been messaging briefly in 2016 and asked whether my situation had since changed and whether I was interested in a job with them now. I replied, asking whether they received my CV/profile from Recruiter #1. No response thus far. Recruiter #2 wrote that they inquired at company A about me being in contact through another recruiter. He further claimed that his agency is contracted by company A exclusively to recruit for them and that Recruiter #1 had not even forwarded my CV to company A. Also, I asked Recruiter #1 whether there has been any news from company A or B. He replied that there were no news, but asked whether he should forward my profile „to a lot of customers that we have“. I declined and said that I would be in touch shortly. Then, I also emailed company B whether they had received my profile from recruiter #1. Also, no response there. So it’s obvious that at least one of the recruiters is acting shady. It’s either Recruiter #1 basically soliciting to companies that he wrongfully described to me as his „customers“ or Recruiter #2 isn’t entirely truthful about being the exclusive recruiting partner of company A and tries to smear Recruiter #1. Out of my gut feeling, I tend to believe Recruiter #2, but I don’t have any evidence/word from the companies who is telling the truth here. So finally my questions: How do I find out which recruiter is telling the truth? I’d like to only continue working with those who are honest. Of course, calling company A and/or B’s HR department might clear things up, but I hesitate to inquire any further as I’m afraid this might impair the application process. Is it a common policy with companies to not respond when a candidate that has been introduced by a recruiter contacts them directly? Also, I obviously should have asked more questions on how the recruiters work and what their relationship with the companies are. Any killer question that I could have asked in order to find out about the recruiters intentions? I don’t know whether this is of any significance: The whole story is taking place in a European city. I’m a software engineer. Edit (8 days later): So meanwhile I've had a phone interview with company A's HR manager. He confirmed they hadn't received anything from recruiter #1. I then confronted recruiter #1 asking for clarification. He came up with some BS that they've not contacted HR, but instead hiring managers directly, bypassing HR. As this sounded even more fishy to me (and I was right in my assumption that they were soliciting my profile), I asked recruiter #1 to delete my details from their database. 

At my last job we scheduled work based on an "ideal hours" concept; hours spent heads-down, flat-out coding new parts of the project (which from an external viewpoint is "forward progress" aka productivity). An 8-hour day has 5 to 6 ideal hours; the rest of this time is spent in meetings, on phone calls, dealing with technical problems, fixing bugs in previous development, refactoring code and paying off other technical debt, etc. All of it's necessary, none of it moves the project forward. In practice, one calendar day may be spent completely heads-down coding and thus may have 8 ideal hours, while the next day may be spent primarily in client meetings and may have zero ideal hours spent coding. It averages out. I will echo other answers and say that your company is unique even among others in the same industry or niche, and thus the ratio of "ideal" to working hours is going to be different. It's usually better to estimate in terms of "programmer-days". Whatever the ideal-to-working ratio is, how many calendar days should a developer be expected to take to finish a work item, given past performance and the estimated complexity of the task? The overwhelming majority of schedulable work items will take more than one programmer-day to complete. Anything smaller than about half a programmer-day can usually be shoehorned in wherever it fits, provided it doesn't turn into the following: 

First off, if you work in the United States, you are protected by the laws against workplace sexual harassment. You don't have to be targeted by the harassment. You don't have to feel discriminated against. All you have to feel is uncomfortable, which you obviously do if this behavior is leading you to look for other employment. The banter creates a "hostile work environment", in violation of U.S. labor law. You don't even have to mention the new co-worker trying to fit in; this behavior has affected you personally. This sounds like an extremely small company, if the owner of the company regularly mingles with the people he pays on a personal level. So, I'm going to assume there isn't an HR department to take your concerns to. You do still have a boss, even if that guy is the owner of the company that's joining in. Make your position clear; the humor is uncomfortable and (if you want to mention you're leaving because of it) that it has influenced your decision to seek other work. Your boss is required by law to do something about it once you have reported it. If your boss doesn't act, he and his company are liable for any damages caused by this behavior (to you or others; this includes the cost of finding a new job, compensation for any pay cut you may have taken to get the hell out, lost wages between the end of your current job and the start of your new one, increased travel costs for a longer commute, etc). Take your case to the EEOC; put the company on record as having a history of discriminatory behavior. You may not stay with the company (and thus be suffering damages) long enough for the case to be settled, but you start a paper trail that will stay with the company as long as it exists; if this behavior is repeated and another report is filed, the EEOC will see very quickly that these aren't isolated incidents and will put the company under a microscope. 

This is one thing that Agile was intended to solve; preventing the development team from having to chase changing priorities and put out fires. All the turbulence of those changes happens on the backlog items the team has not taken up yet. Once it's out for development, de-prioritizing it has major consequences for the development team and so such actions should be prevented except in extraordinary circumstances. This is one Agile practice that's relatively straightforward to implement all by itself, if maybe not "easy". Speaking to you as if you are the IT manager: 

Note: I am an entry level Web Developer in the US. I started my current job a year and a half ago. At that time, I was right out of college and eager for a paycheck. I didn't think much of it, but now I realize that I never signed or received a contract regarding my responsibilities. The most I signed was a payment agreement but it didn't include a job description or title. A usual day's work for me includes development and testing of new features for a web application. There are only two developers on this team (three when I first started), and we've fallen into our own niches where I primarily work on our web application and he primarily works on our standalone software. Lately, my boss has been throwing a lot of curveballs at me. This includes being asked to go off-site during off-hours at very late notice, as well as programming in languages that I'm not familiar with to help my coworker with his tasks. We've also collectively turned into the IT department for the whole building and have been setting up new servers and Internet connections. To me, these things feel a bit out of scope for what I was hired for, and I definitely don't feel like I am being paid enough to tackle so many things. For even more context, I was originally hired under the impression that I was going to be doing QA and Tech Support, but within a month I was given more and more development tasks (unfortunately without an increase in pay). So I feel like I was hired to do one thing, currently do another, and am being asked to do something different still. So my questions are: How should I handle this situation and am I even legally allowed to turn down out-of-scope tasks? Is it appropriate to ask to sign a job description or renegotiate pay this far into the game? Should I consider this entire thing a big red flag? Edit: A lot of people are suggesting other previous questions about how to decline work outside of scope or how to negotiate pay if I'm doing too much work. And while those are all incredibly useful resources, my issue is more centered around the fact that I don't have a job description at all. I negotiated my pay assuming I would be QA, my usual workflow has always been development, and my boss likes to throw IT, Tech Support, and the occasional road trip to work with physical machinery my way. No one in my company has ever actually told me "You are a programmer." or "You are a field grunt." I would really like to have someone tell me exactly who I am to the company and what I should be doing, but I don't know how to initiate that conversation. 

Depression is a disease. A cup of coffee cannot fix a disease. A cup of coffee cannot cure cancer. A cup of coffee cannot cure depression. I can guarantee you that coming under fire for her number of JIRA tickets did not cause her to commit suicide. Even if you could have stopped that person from walking through the door and chastising her, it would not have changed the outcome. What you saw was most likely the cultivation of months or maybe even years of pain, negative thoughts, and incredibly well-hidden emotions that she finally let go of. I'm really sorry for your loss. Depression is especially hard because it's so hard to recognize and even harder to understand. My best advice for you is to go check in with a therapist about it if it's really upsetting you. Think of it as a gift to her--keeping your own mental health in check.
