Something like the EU with a regularly rotating Presidency with terms measured in months, a highly federal system of administration, and lots of side deals between members might be a good model. 

One alternative to having a true rigid body ring around Uranus (which has a radius of about 25,000 km (a circumference of ca. 156,000 km) would be to put in place a dense ring system of asteroids/rocky stuff/ice a la Saturn. This wouldn't need to have nearly the extraordinary structural features of a rigid body ring but you could have almost a thousand largish (50-100 km diameter) asteroids hollowed out to hold habitable areas and hops from one asteroid to the next could be on the order of 1-2 km and could even be connected by wires with a fair amount of slack for communications and a guide lines for non-rocket powered transportation between them. This would provide a lot of habitable living space and pretty managable connections between them while being far less of an engineering masterpiece. And, even if you eventually figured out how to build a rigid body ring, you'd probably need to start with something like this during the construction phase anyway. Over time, you could combine nearby asteroids into rigid body chunks as large of the dynamics of the situation could support with ordinary materials, perhaps reducing the number of rigid bodies in the ring from a thousand or so to the low hundreds. When the instability of the chunks started to exceed your engineering capabilities, you'd stop building and settle in. 

Diseases in nature tend to naturally become less virulent over time, in part, because the disease vector changes and in part because the host population develops immunity to it. How possible is it, in theory, to accurately predict the time period until immunity to the disease or its decreased virulence causes it to be an unimportant threat to almost all human populations and how accurate could those prediction be, in theory? Is there an effective minimum or maximum period of time over which this happens in a modern-like population? For example, suppose that someone was designing a bioweapon in the context of a world like Earth in the near future. Could they design a disease to become obsolete after a fairly precisely measured period of time that was less than a human lifetime but more than a few months? 

It is hard to see that this would have been a positive thing in the long run. There were some Asian monarchies that persisted fairly late (Siam and Japan's until the present day, China's until the Communist Revolution, Malaysia (a rotating federal monarchy), Korea's until 1910), and those were generally positive in bringing about national unity and providing a centralize response to colonialism. But, in each of those cases, the monarch was unifying a genuine nation state or an indigenously created federal state. In contrast, in 1857, it had been centuries since India was unified under a single monarchy, and was far from a nation-state. India was divided religiously, had a couple dozen languages, had a weak sense of national identity, and had a homegrown class of lawyers, senior civil servants, and politicians that was still very thin. A monarch is nothing without layer upon layer of well established aristocrats below him to legitimatize him and provide a foundation of elite support. A monarch without a long dynastic history that encompassed the entire sub-continent, or an aristocracy, would be hard pressed to rule. India was precocious when it came to anti-colonial revolution, but if you look at the examples of Latin American revolutions in the 19th century, and the many grants of independence in the 1960s, for example, in Africa, again and again and again, the well meant initial independence regimes almost always collapsed amidst allegations of corruption and incompetence by the civilian administrations put in place, and the military regimes that intermittently followed were almost always worse. These were often followed by tin pot, cruel dictators who mismanaged their countries relative to the colonial regimes that preceded them. When India finally gained independence, it was only after an adequate indigenous class of civil servants and lawyers was in place, and a lengthy campaign by unified political/protest movement had created a sense of national unity with grass roots support and a class of political leaders to implement the new government. Even then independent India soon divided into Hindu majority and Muslim majority regions in an event that was a apocalyptic national trauma with blood running in the streets, and in the Muslim part, coups and a national schism soon followed again. It would only have been worse in 1857, for everyplace except perhaps a small kingdom in the region where the mutiny took place, with everything else fracturing (not that it was fully unified in 1857 under a consolidated British rule in any case). 

Long Distance Power Grids Are Virtually Impossible To Defend Against Terrorism Or Insurgencies Even a very timid and small insurgency or terrorist group determined to disrupt the kind of power grid you envision is virtually unstoppable. A group with fifty active members with a million dollar budget could shut down the power of a civilization with hundreds of millions or billions of people with virtually guaranteed success, without needing any terribly expensive or advanced technology, even if the defenders devotes a hundred billion dollars of resources and millions of people to the cause of defending the grid. Lawrence of Arabia did something similar to disrupt rail transportation in North Africa. This is a problem inherent in the nature of a long distance power grid across desolate areas that is pretty much impossible to overcome. No technological solution can solve this efficiently. If you have this security problem, you have only one viable choice: abandon the long distance power grid. Even if the location of the cables could be perfectly hidden, there are so many people at a fairly low level in any bureaucracy with a need to know (e.g. planning commissions, maintenance crews), that any organization with a mildly motivated and halfway competent spy or two could easily learn the location of a host of vulnerable locations from power company records or word of mouth from power company employees. The only reason that this isn't a problem in places like the United States or Canada is that nobody has a terrorist agenda devoted to taking down the power grid, and that the power grids are predominantly more decentralized and localized. Option One: Move Energy Via Fuel Cells Rather Than Using Cables One alternative is to ditch the idea of power transmission over long distance cables entirely. If you could built a very efficient, high energy density fuel cells, and had a low energy cost way to move those fuel cells (e.g. by ship or barge over a major oceans and/or river systems), you charge your fuel cells at the generator, deliver them to the destination (with a fuel cell inventory cushion for foreseeable interruptions in deliveries), and you power the grid where the power is needed with the fuel cells. Once a fuel cell is out of juice, you can ship the empty cells back on the return trip of the ships/barges. This leaves you with no immobile cables or transformer stations in the middle of nowhere that are hard to defend in the event of a conflict. All you need to protect is the generation location, the local grid at the destination, and ships or barges carrying the fuel cells while they are en route (and the incentive for anyone to attack those ships or barges is going to be much lower on the return trip than on the trip from the generator to the place where the power is used). The ships and barges can be protected are small and mobile, and can be protected with point-defense strategies similar to those of modern warships. Also, while the route may be effectively fixed in a river system (although the timing can be made unpredictable if desired), once you are on an ocean or sea you can use an unpredictable and varied route rather than the absolutely most efficient route, to make it harder to target the ships. A Variation: Use Ship Based Rechargeable Fuel Cells With Short Cables Connecting To Port Cities In a slight variation on this plan, you could have a short power cable running from the power generation site to the nearest port town at which fuel cells would be charged (perhaps even while still on the ships returning with empty fuel cells). Similarly, at the destination, a much shorter distance power cable could deliver energy from the fuel cells that would stay on the ship at all times to the local power grid until they were depleted and the fuel cell ship returned to the port near the generator to recharge. As long as neither the generation site nor the destination are too far inland, this could be a very workable alternative to putting the generator and the destination grid on the same power grid over many 1000s of kilometers of mostly deserted territory where the security of that grid in deserted territory could not be assured. 

I would think that instead of ridges you would get a topography similar to the shape of the Jeppesen Terminal at Denver International Airport (photo credit to Denver International Airport) with lots of successive peaks instead of the long ridges such of those of the Rocky Mountains in the background. 

Moderate Extreme Temperatures With Heat Exchange Via Wind If you want to make the planet habitable, you'd be better off for a tiny fraction of the energy budget involved, to set up a megastructure functionally equivalent to giant fans to get an atmosphere to circulate rapidly around the planet carrying heat from the hot side to the cold side to balance it out. Moving a comparatively light atmosphere that was perhaps 60 miles thick and would retain its angular momentum once set spinning except to the extent that friction slowed it, would lead to a much more manageable energy budget to the planet. 

My first speculation was that size matters in this case, which is an idea that I will explore first, but upon further consideration, I think that this is partially right for a different reason and that the amenability of Bos to providing farm labor relative to Bison may have been the most important factor. At the time that cattle were first domesticated (something that probably happened a number of centuries after the domestication of sheep and goats, and tens of thousands of years after the domestication of dogs, but several thousand of years before the horse was domesticated (and before the hybrid mule was available), and a dozen centuries or so before donkey were domesticated) human communities were much smaller than they are today. A community with 200 people in it would have been a major city. A few dozen people in a community would have been pretty typical. Bison are much larger than Bos, on average. This means that the same amount of pasture can support fewer Bison than Bos, and that each Bison slaughtered will produce more meat at once. Slaughtering more meat than your community members can promptly eat in a week or two is going to produce lots a wasted meat that your community spent a lot of time and effort nurturing. But, if each slaughtered animal is smaller, it is easier to eat a larger share of the meet from the slaughtered animal before it spoils and is wasted. Indeed, even modern cows are probably bigger than the earliest domesticated Bos. So, meat production from slaughtered cows could be broken up into more manageable installments. Upon further consideration, I still think that smaller size was an advantage for Bos, but I think that it may have had less to do with the amount of meat produced per animal slaughtered (after all smoking and/or salting beef to preserve it must have been mastered quite early on, probably even before herding and domesticated animals were developed), and it had more to do with a few other factors related to size: 

Superstition is pretty closely related to the unpredictability of life. The fewer surprises people have, and the more people understand what does happen, the less they need an alternative. So, if the environment was very stable (same weather every year, crops never fail, etc.) and education even on a folk basis was adequate to explain what people experienced, there might be very little magic or religion. 

Short Answer No. There is nothing you can do consistent with real world science to mitigate extremely high gravity that would make the surface of such a planet habitable for humans, nor could an otherwise habitable environment exist at such a high gravity. But, there are circumstances related to your scenario that could be workable that I explore. Long Answer What Kind Of Planet Could Fit This Description? The specific gravity of the planet Earth is about 5.5. Lead is about 11; gold and depleted uranium are about 19; osmium, the most dense naturally occurring element is 22.6. For an Earth radius planet to have 30Gs of gravity, it would have to have a specific density of 165. This is much less than the specific density of a white dwarf star (about 200,000) or of a neutron star (about 200,000,000,000), but even the most dense planet ever discovered has a specific density of only about 23 g/cm^3 (incidentally and probably not coincidentally, it is a pulsar planet). So, it is basically impossible to have a planet with a radius smaller than Earth that had gravity that strong. The most dense possible Earth radius planet would have a surface gravity of about 4G, and as it got smaller the gravity would decrease. You can also increase gravity by making the planet much bigger in radius than Earth. Indeed, these are the only kinds of observed bodies with surface gravity on the order of 30Gs. Planets with gravity that strong are rare, but they do exist. As of 5 August 2012: 

Make the U.K., Russia and the Ottoman Empires offers that they can't refuse. Rather than making war with Russia and tempting war on other fronts, make deals with them that make them happy. Secure their support with trade deals that are unfairly favorable to them. Offer to take their prisoners and dissidents. Offer to squelch activists in the empire who dislike them. Offer to build rail lines that connect their capitols to your empire at your expense. Trade them your colonies abroad for their cooperation. Imagine how the world would have changed if the Louisiana Purchase had sold French North America in the Mississippi basin at a discount to the Ottoman Turks or the Russians or Portugal, instead of the Americans. Carefully manage local elites Co-opt existing business leaders and aristocrats in a manner that allows them a bit of control of the dramatic rate of change brought about by joining your empire and assures them a prominent place in it. Meanwhile, put local elites who refuse to be co-opted in fear for their lives. Secure the full blessing of the Church Do what it takes to get the Church on your side. Consolidate your military position Rather than further expanding, expand the French mass army (one of the first in history) to other countries, raising citizen armies and training them in every country. Then deploy them in each case far from home where they will have no local allegiances. Resupply your troops during the lull with weapons and logistic supplies. Devote resources to propaganda Hire pitch men and artists and playwrights and musicians to tell the story of the miraculous enlightenment of your empire for everyone to hear everywhere all of the time. 

Early on in the Mexican American War, Anglo settlers in the Mexican State of Alta California briefly attempted to form the Bear Republic, which might have persisted if annexation to the U.S. had not followed: 

The usual conceit is that: (1) witches can "pass" for human, (2) they refrain from using their powers when mundane people who can't be trusted are able to observe them as a universal code of ethics, (3) they self-enforce the code of secrecy if it is violated, and (4) they use whatever measures are necessary, including brain washing by magic, to insure that unreliable muggles are prevented from sharing their experiences with others in a way that will be taken seriously. This is the approach taken in at least 90%+ of the contemporary fantasy genre (in all fictional media), and also in kindred genres such as those involving aliens (see, e.g., the TV series Roswell and V, and the movie series Men in Black), gods and demigods in a modern setting, and those involving fairies, angels, demons, replicants, androids, superheroes, psychics and mutants. The first element ("passing" for humans) often takes some additional effort on the part of the non-humans. One decent example of a case where some serious effort is necessary for witches to "pass" as human is The Witches (1983) by Roald Dahl, in which a hidden corps of witches among humans has to engage in some previous serious (basically non-magical) efforts to disguise themselves to go unnoticed. Elaborate non-magical disguises were also commonplace in Men in Black. In Stephanie Meyer's novel The Host, the non-humans hid inside human beings. In the modern reboot of Battlestar Galactica the robots posing as humans were carefully modeled to look like humans. In the case of much of the fiction involving fairies, the fey use what is usually called a "glamour" to conceal their appearance to the average human's mind.
