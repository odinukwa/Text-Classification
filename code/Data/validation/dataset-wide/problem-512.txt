No rim tape - sometimes new bikes won't have rim tape, and the tube can get slightly cut on spoke holes, if you don't have rim tape, put some in, it will save you in the long run Rim has something sharp on it - rarely you might find that a rim has a little bit of metal sticking out that causes a puncture, generally this isn't a problem if you use rim tape. Tube incorrectly installed - make sure that when you put the tube in that you pump it up a tiny bit, and move the tyre left and right and go round the whole rim like that(making sure that you can't see the tube), it will stop you getting the tube squished in between the tyre and the rim. If your tube isn't distributed evenly around the tyre you can also get a similar problem. Tyre has something poking through or a cut - When you change the tyre run your fingers around the inside of the tyre, often there is something poking through, also inspect the inside and outside of the tyre, often there is a small cut, even a tiny cut will cause a road bike tube to fail. Incorrect pressure - If your pressure is too low you are likely to get pinch flats, and if it is too high you are likely to get random failures. Make sure you check the recommended pressure on the side of the tyre. Pinch flats can in their worst case cut through the tyre as well, so if your tyres are low pump them up! Cheap tyres - I have had quite a few tyres of different qualities, and it always seems that the cheap ones get some kind of cut in them quite quickly, but the mid range ones don't tend to get this. This mainly is appropriate to road bikes. Tube Installation damage - You hear about people that damage the tube when installing them sometimes, just make sure that when you are installing the tyre the tube isn't between your tyre and the rim! 

It really depends on your area and how fancy your bike is, there are plenty of videos of thieves nicking bikes, like this page. My rule of thumb is: 

You didn't mention if you had a road bike or a mountain bike, but road bikes tend to cause a lot more problems with punctures, purely because the higher pressure will show up any installation problems and they will get flat quicker (or atleast flat enough to get a pinch flat). How to fix it: These days I don't bother repairing tubes, it quickly becomes a frustrating exercise, and in the end you don't want to be 30kms away from home with a leaky tube. If I got 1 flat I would replace the tube, and if I get another flat after that I would replace the tyre and tube. It seems really over the top, but it is very easy to put in 3 tubes into a tyre that has some kind of almost invisible nick in it, and it is cheaper to have just bought a new tyre and tube. I guess for me it is more valuable to have a bike that will just work when I get out there. Once you have read all that, you might want to have a read of Sheldon Brown's guide to flats. 

Sometimes when I am cycling I will try to do some stretching to alleviate some backpain. Usually I arch my back, or push into the pedal and straighten my leg and stretch. Does anyone do something similar? If so, can you share the stretches, exercises you do? Thanks in advance. 

I am soon going to buy a pair of pedals (and new shoes of course) for my road bike (mostly used for commuting, and short-ish rides (40-50 miles/80Km). Most important to me is being able to walk in my cycling shoes BUT ALSO, be able to cycle my bike without needing to wear my cycling shoes. (Ideally, both are equally as important...ideally.) I am currently torn between a pair of SPD OR a pair of SPD-SL pedals, and then the required shoes. Ideally I am looking for a pair of SPD-SL pedals, so I can ride my bike sometimes without my bike shoes without killing myself. Something like the Shimano PD-R540 SPD. [1] They have a resonably large platform for the foot, which helps when wearing "normal" shoes. Then I am also looking for a pair of SPD off-road shoes, something like the Shimano M076 MTB SPD Shoes.[2] The reason I say these is they have some grip, and the cleat is slightly recessed, not the make/model. So to my question. It can be asked in either of two ways: Does an SPD/SPD-SL pedal exist? OR Does an SPD/SPD-SL shoe exist? All advice welcome. [1] $URL$ [2] $URL$ 

I'm looking to use some Pinheads on my bike. The front wheel is a through axle wheel. From Pinhead's product website they have an option for P1.0 or P1.5 thread - I'm looking for a M12 124mm long bolt. I'm unsure what P1.0/P1.5 signifies on the thread, and also unsure on how to measure it. Can anyone explain what the P-value signifies? And how I would measure it? 

My guess was the object was still embedded in the tyre as it took 1-2 days after fixing punctures 2, 3, 4 for next puncture to flatten the tire completely. I examined the site, and tried to clean it out with a pair of tweezers, narrow knife, etc. What are my options to continue using this tyre? I have (rightly or wrongly) applied some patch adhesive to the outside of the tyre on the puncture site, to see what happens. 

Does anyone have any experience of using puncture resistant tyres when they have been cut so badly as the object pierces the tyre right through? Being Mr. Unlucky, 2-3 months ago I managed to get a puncture on my Schwalbe Marathon Plus'. I changed the tub initially. When the second, third puncture happened, I started looking closer. The object (what I am guessing was a piece of glass, from memory) cleanly cut straight through the "SmartGuard layer". 

Many blogs and other sources of information on cycling advocate "riding like a car" or "taking the lane" as a way to increase safety and visibility when riding on a road. But such advice presupposes that doing so is legal. Is it generally the case that bikes may use the "full lane", or is it better to check with local ordinances? Is there a general rule of thumb one should apply in cases where one is not certain about local rules? 

Congestion charging: a very effective way of reducing the number of cars on the road, and increasing the average skill of the drivers that remain (since an increasing proportion of the remaining drivers are professional drivers). 

An additional resource that may point the way for the future: "A vending machine that serves up safety: MIT class creates bike helmet dispenser" for use in conduction with Boston's Hubway cycle hire scheme. The first of these are now being deployed in Boston. 

Over this range the outstanding feature is the rise and fall of per minute cost, the initially very high cost per minute, and, again, the large difference in cost between systems. 

Many major cities now have bike sharing schemes, and each seems to have its own system of rates, designed to encourage shorter rides and quick returns; but it's hard to compare them. Is there a reference somewhere that draws direct comparisons among the pricing schemes for the major bike sharing systems? 

Here, some odd features are exposed, notably the leveling off of cost per minute, the jump in average cost in London (from being cheapest, to matching New York's most expensive), and the long decline in some cities. Again, it's most useful to focus on short rides: 

Vienna, Austria With excellent coverage of the old city center and linkage to an extensive bike trail network (on the sidewalks!), this system is well loved and well used, but it feels a bit worn down (the bikes are in terrible shape) and the system is old and cumbersome (not the excellent system now in use on London and Boston and soon to be deployed in New York). Still, it's an essential part of any visit to the city. 

Both if these figures though conceal a misconception about the pricing schemes that all of these systems use: that they discourage long rides. This is really only partly true, and only true, as it were, "in steps", as one can clearly see by looking at the cost per minute, for "rides" of up to 24 hours:
