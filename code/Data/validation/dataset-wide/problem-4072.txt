You need to add some assumption, otherwise $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\\\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ add to a matrix with eigenvalues $1 \pm \sqrt{n}$. Maybe your operators are self-adjoint? 

As HenrikRÃ¼ping wrote, my comment is false. Nevertheless, I think the method is interesting (obviously, it isn't mine), although it gives something "explicit", but not "compact". Maybe you could provide us with context? For example, are you interested in the behavior when $k \rightarrow + \infty$ (assuming the field is topological)? If $XAX^{-1}$ and $YQY^{-1}$ are "nice" (diagonal or Jordan normal form), then make the change of variable (is this English?) $P'=XPY$. Then viewing $S_k$ as a linear function of $P$, $XS_k(P)Y=\sum_{i=1}^k XAX^{-1} P' YQY^{-1}$, so up to a change of base on $M_{m,n}(K)$, the endomorphism $S_k$ of this vector space is given in a nice form (eigenvalues are known). But I'm not sure this is really what you're asking for, and your last comment suggests you already know what I just wrote. 

It is also true for local rings. Let $A$ be a matrix with coefficients in $K = \mathrm{Frac}(R)$, such that $A \mathrm{GL}_n(R) A^{-1} \subset \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. Then in particular, $A (I_n + E_{i,j})A^{-1} \in M_n(R)$ and $A (I_n+E_{i,i}+E_{i,j}+E_{j,i})A^{-1} \in M_n(R)$ for all $i \neq j$, so that $a_{i,j} b_{k,l} \in R$ for all $i,j,k,l$, where $a$, $b$ denote the coefficients of $A$, $B:=A^{-1}$. Since $\sum_j a_{1,j}b_{j,1}=1$, there is a $j_0$ such that $a_{1,j_0} b_{j_0,1} \in R^{\times}$. Let $A'=a_{1,j_0}^{-1} A$. Then the coefficients of $A'^{-1} = a_{1,j_0} B$ are in $R$, and those of $A'$ also because $\frac{a_{i,j}}{a_{1,j_0} }= \frac{a_{i,j}b_{j_0,1}}{a_{1,j_0}b_{j_0,1}} \in R$. For a general $R$, this just shows that $A \in K^{\times} \mathrm{GL}_n (R_m) $ for any maximal ideal $m$ of $R$. Edit: This implies that the normalizer is indeed $K^{\times} \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$ in the case $R$ is a UFD. Indeed we have that $I^n=(\det (A))$ where $I=\sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} R$ by localization ($i/\det(A) \in \cap_m R_m = R$ for any $i$ product of $n$ coefficients of $A$). Looking at decompositions, we see that $\mathrm{gcd}(a_{i,j})^n = \det(A)$, and so $A/\\mathrm{gcd}(a_{i,j}) \in \mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. 

Let $E$ be a locally compact Hausdorff space with countable base and $X_t$ be a stochastic process taking values in the one-point compactification of $E$ (with the Borel $\sigma$-algebra). Let $f$ be a continuous function vanishing at infinity. I'm wondering under what conditions it is true that $x \mapsto \mathbf{E}^{x}[f(X_t)]$ is a continuous function? If $X_t$ is a Brownian motion on $\mathbb{R}$, it is straightforward to verify this is true and, in fact, it is true whenever $X_t$ is an Ito diffusion. An example where this fails is if we let $E=\mathbf{R}$ and let $X_t$ be a reflected Brownian motion on $\{ x: x\geq 0 \}$ and be the negative of the absolute value of a Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^3$ on $\{x : x<0 \}$. More broadly, I'm curious as to what kind of conditions on the sample paths of a Markov process $X$ with continuous paths force it to be a Feller process. The condition I'm asking about seems to be the one that does not come for free if you start with such an $X$. 

This sparked my curiosity. A little googling gives this: $URL$ On page 5 they discuss your question. If you make the filtration coarser, the Markov property can't go away, but you can add stuff to the filtration to kill the Markov property. This should probably be a comment, but I'm not reputable enough . . . 

Assume $L/k$ normal, and take $\sigma \in G$, which can be extended to an element of $Gal(L/k)$. Then $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu} \in L$, and if $\gamma$ is the nontrivial element of $Gal(L/K)$, $\sigma^{-1} \gamma \sigma$ is trivial on $K$, and being nontrivial on $L$ it has to be equal to $\gamma$. So $\gamma\left( \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\mu \right) = \sigma(\gamma(\sqrt{\mu}))/\gamma(\sqrt{\mu}) = \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$, so we can take $\alpha_{\sigma} = \sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$, it is an element of $K$. Now for the other way, take $\tilde{\sigma} \in Gal(\bar{L}/k)$. Denote the restriction of $\tilde{\sigma}$ to $K$ by $\sigma$. Then $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}= \pm \alpha_{\sigma}$ (this equality is in $\bar{L}$), so $\sigma(\sqrt{\mu}) = \pm \alpha_{\sigma} \sqrt{\mu} \in L$, so $L$ is normal. Consider a set-theoretic section $\sigma \mapsto \tilde{\sigma}$ for the surjective morphism $Gal(L/k) \rightarrow G$. Then the (up to a coboundary) 2-cocycle $\beta_0$ associated to the group extension is given by the formula $\tilde{\sigma} \tilde{\tau} = \beta_0(\sigma,\tau) \widetilde{\sigma \tau}$. Evaluating at $\sqrt{\mu}$ gives the equality between $\beta$ and $\beta_0$, if for every $\sigma \in G$, $\alpha_{\sigma} = \tilde{\sigma}(\sqrt{\mu})/\sqrt{\mu}$. You can always choose your section so that it is the case (change of section = associating a sign to each $\sigma \in G$). 

Pick a $\sigma \in \Gamma_F$ such that $\sigma |_E$ generates $\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$. There is an $A \in \mathrm{GL}_n$ such that for all $x \in \Gamma_E$, $\rho(\sigma x \sigma^{-1}) = A \rho(x) A^{-1}$, and if $q$ denotes the order of $\mathrm{Gal}(E/F)$, we get that $\rho(\sigma^q x \sigma^{-q}) = A^q \rho(x) A^{-q}$, which by irreducibility and Schur's lemma implies that $\rho(\sigma^q) A^{-q} = \lambda \mathrm{Id}$. Choose any $\mu$ such that $\mu^q = \lambda$. Then setting $\rho(\sigma)=\mu A$ is one of the $q$ ways to extend $\rho$. 

As a person interested in group theory and all things related, I'd like to deepen my knowledge of group actions. The typical (and indeed the most prominent) example of an action is that of a representation. In this case the target space has so much structure that one can deduce a huge number of properties of a given group just by working out some linear algebra (to put it bluntly). Now, I am wondering 

I realize my question is probably a bit naive and ignorant of what is probably a standard knowledge but I actually can't think of that many useful actions and wikipedia article on them doesn't provide many examples (at least not very interesting and non-linear). Not that I can't think of anything at all. Coming from physics, I am aware of stuff such as gauge symmetries (free transitive fiber-wise actions on fiber bundles) or various flows (whether for time evolution, or as an symmetry orbit). And I am also aware of the usual Lie theory, left/right translations, etc. But I am looking for more. Note: feel free to generalize the above to any action. I'd be certainly also interested in actions of algebras, rings, etc. 

You might look at the introduction of Bernt Oskendal's Stochastic Differential Equations. He gives seven motivating problems (at least he does in the edition I have) for studying stochastic calculus. One big area that you have not mentioned is the applications of stochastic calculus to finance. 

A Markov process $X_t$ on $E$ is a Feller-Dynkin (or sometimes just Feller) process if its semigroup is a strongly continuous, sub-Markov semigroup $\{P_t:t\geq 0\}$ of linear operators on $C_0(E)$ (my definition comes from the text of Rogers and Williams or see Wikipedia). I am wondering what is known about when a time change of a Feller-Dynkin process is still Feller-Dynkin. I believe that I have read that this is not true in general (and can be a tricky thing to determine). I would be curious to see an example where this fails and also to know if the Feller-Dynkin property is preserved if the time change is nice enough. For what it's worth, the time changes I am interested in are actually $C^{\infty}$. I do not need the Feller property to be preserved, but thinking about it made me realize I do not have a very good feeling for these sort of things. 

I want to learn about more examples of this kind (not necessarily as important though) to get a better idea about how different kinds of metric spaces look like and also about the fields that are based on them. 

Note: sorry, if this is too vague or too basic. But I don't have a solid mathematical background, so it's hard to know where to look for answers to these questions. I am just trying to learn about topology in general and about metric spaces in particular (mainly because of their applications in probability theory) and I will definitely accept as an answer a reference to a standard literature. 

As is often the case in mathematics there is an option of studying a more general topic but this comes with a price of losing some interesting properties which are only present in the more specialized area. In this case, I am interested in learning about relative usefulness of a metric space carrying some additional structure. To give some obvious examples: 

I'd say every statically typed functional language is such. Why? There's a well-known relation between propositions and types, or more precisely between certain theories of logic and certain type theories going by the name of Curry--Howard correspondence. This relation has a less well-known cousin known as Curry--Howard--Lambek correspondence that extends it to categories. Thus, because every reasonable statically typed functional language is based on type theory, it has direct connection to category theory as well. You simply cannot escape it, try as you might. Bob Harper likes to call this The Holy Trinity -- categories, languages and logic. The list of such languages follows: Haskell, ML, OCaml, Idris, Coq, Agda, etc. Of course, you have to take all of this with a grain of salt. Safe for Coq and Agda -- both of which are foremost theorem provers -- these languages contain many industry-driven quirks that make them less susceptible to the formal reasoning mentioned in the first paragraph. In a bit different direction, because type theory is so expressive (for example, it can replace set theory as foundations of mathematics), it's fairly straightforward to express many algebraic structures in it. All of the above languages use this feature profoundly, with e.g. monads in Haskell playing a very prominent role.
