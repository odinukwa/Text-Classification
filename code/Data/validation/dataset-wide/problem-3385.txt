If someone could offer me a reference to such hypotheses (or an empirical validation or contra-indication), it would be welcome. For now, I'll reference to Wikipedia, giving the general picture of habitus in general and its possible causes, via Norbert Elias' : 

Then, one can assume primates could have used the clapping ✋, as a more symbolic way of representing or channeling this anger or frustration. 

I'll offer a small piece of review from an article in the NYT by the famous professor of bioethics Peter Singer (source: Peter Singer, , nytimes.com, 6/10/2011), discussing this book of Steven Pinker, one of today's most famous linguistic psychologist, which also talks about a change (i.c. a difference between the north and the south) in physiological reactions to insults; and a reference to Norbert Elias' pacification process. It also contains an empirical verification of the hypothesis of Thomas Hobbes classic contract theory book : 

If I'm remembering correctly, according to Atkins and Rundell (2008) [1], many projects build their own software, but there are also commercial packages such as TshwaneLex ($URL$ Atkins and Rundell (2008) go into some detail about the requirements of such software, so you may find their book helpful. They mention that there are two types of software which are needed for any lexicography project: what they call a Corpus Query System (CQS) and what they call a Dictionary Writing System (DWS). The point of a CQS is to access evidence on the basis of which dictionary entries can be written; in that sense, their needs are very similar to those of standard corpus linguistic software* (which include the ability to draw up concordances, as well as other features). The point of the DWS is to offer an interface for generating and storing what will make up the content of the dictionary. [1] Atkins, B.T. Sue and Michael Rundell (2008) The Oxford Guide to Practical Lexicography. *an example of corpus linguistic software is AntConc, which is free, though probably not powerful enough for a lexicography project. You can see a list of commonly used corpus linguistics software here: $URL$ 

Perhaps the next step could then be silent visual-only clapping ✋? Now, the above mentioned thought is about clapping, but it isn't about applause. But it is also imaginable that this decline of anger, frustration and adrenaline-outbursts is coupled with a decline of the outbursts at the sympathetic / applauding side of mankind; both inherent and measurable physiologically, as also measurable sociologically in less exuberant applauding behavior. Thus a decline of general (emotionally-induced or -copuled) physical behavior (or at least the smearing out of the peaks of its outbursts). The large-scale decline of violence, homicide and war is documented in 

Nouns/entities help to determine the verb sense, and verb senses influence the noun sense. Complements & prep phrases help with both. "The dog walked along the bank of the river." (along river indicates a route/path) Google describes their approach here: $URL$ (source code available) Some have used propbank frames: $URL$ And for entities, you might look at OpenAI: $URL$ good luck! 

Several taxonomies for discourse structures (markers, connectives, functions) exist including PDTB, RST, RST extensions, etc. That said, I've noticed that several of these efforts are 10-20 years old. What are the most common/popular modern approaches (in 2018) to label discourse via a taxonomy? 

That I am aware of, most corpora of British English are not freely available. There are, however, corpora of British English, including POS-tags and formal language, which can be downloaded by individuals, although I am not aware of any which are open source. These include: 

Another technique that would be relevant for your comparative task is keyness analysis, which basically looks at words* which occur significantly more often in one group of texts than in another. The technique comes from the field of corpus linguistics, a field which has developed a number of techniques and tools for analysing large amounts of texts in both qualitative and quantitative ways. Wikipedia has an introduction to corpus linguistics ($URL$ and you can find a brief introduction to keyness analysis on the site for Wordsmith Tool, a corpus linguistics software ($URL$ *note that keyness analysis can be done at the level of words, but also semantic groupings of words or POS categories. In the latter cases, it would involve identifying categories which occur significantly more often in one corpus than in another. 

1 medal, 2 sides I guess one would need to differentiate between 2 types of social semantic contexts, regarding the same visual applauding sign: Visual waving or other clapping-reminiscent oscillating hand-movements, 

It is imaginable that clapping is a more complex task for them (since it is less exuberant) and silent applause ✋perhaps even more so. 

As, I think, today it's certainly impossible to exactly pin down the date at which this behavior (idem with loud clapping: one can only point to first written descriptions, and further more: I'd guess this behavior is much older than the writing system) arose; I will try to embed its origin in the light of a parallel evolution: A parallel with a structural large-scale evolution Silent applause might actually, but that is of course mere speculative, have a similar origin as the decline of homicide (and violence in general); since it can be viewed in the light of (and as the extrapolating continuation thereof) the decline of physical violence which might be coupled with the development of loud clapping ✋(and in the next stage then perhaps: silent applause ✋). First: let's take the following model as a mainframe, characteristic of violent behavior (amongst others). 

One word for this phenomenon is collocation - which is defined in many ways, but generally refers to two or more words which have a tendency to co-occur. The wikipedia page ($URL$ currently defines it both as 'a sequence of words or terms that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance' and as 'partly or fully fixed expressions that become established through repeated context-dependent use' (two different definitions with different theoretical implications). Examples on the Wikipedia page include 'nuclear family' and 'make a decision'. Research is ongoing to explore the idea that collocations are (mentally) processed differently from other groupings of words. A good starting-point to read about this could be Michael Hoey's theory of lexical priming, which holds that what we know about a word comes from our experience of it, so that our mental representation of it includes knowledge about the words it tends to co-occur with. Hence when we encounter word X, we will more easily retrieve words which often co-occur with word X than words which co-occur less often with word X. An example of a study referring to lexical priming in relation to language processing is Gagné (2001) [1]. [1] Gagné, C. L., (2001), 'Relation and lexical priming during the interpretation of noun–noun combinations.', Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, Vol 27(1), Jan 2001, 236-254.

Cautious preliminary discussion From this small glance, I would accept the confirmation of the decline of violence by Steven Pinker. However, I haven't yet found empirical verification of the guess that not only physical violence; thus physical exuberant behavior coupled with it; but also applauding behavior has declined in exuberant appearance (and perhaps the outbursts of the hormone-coupled emotions associated with it). Primates, I imagine, can also applaud (I'd guess very exuberantly). But they can not clap ✋(unless they are thought by humans). Elwyn Simons (specialist in primate paleontology & morphology and primate biology; researcher of anthropoid origins and evolution) (source: ): 

You have two input choices: 1. analyze dictionaries (wordnet, worknik or wiktionary), 2. use word embeddings (word2vec, glove, elmo). Use this data with a WSD (word sense disambiguation) solution. Search github for WSD. Also, this is worth looking at: $URL$ 

I'm noticing that some English verbs use the -ed suffix to indicate the current state. Using this example: $URL$ Specifically, the verb sense, ‘the film is based on a novel by Pat Conroy’ I (incorrectly?) thought current state verbs were presented in base form or progressive form. Are there a set of verbs that use -ed to indicate current state? Is there a name for this concept?
