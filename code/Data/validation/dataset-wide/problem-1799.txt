As a possibly related issue, today I experience a server outage for reasons yet unknown. As part of the investigation into this I used Plesk to reboot the server. This action completed successfully and was the last action I performed in Plesk. Since the reboot I can access all services other than plesk itself. Having never encountered this issue before, and also being something of a newbie when it comes to administering a Linux based server, I have no idea where to go next? Is there are log file I can check for service start errors? Is the solution staring me in the face? Or maybe something else. Thanks in advance EDIT Something else that may or may not be relevant: After rebooting, and before attempting to access Plesk again I installed sysstat with yum in order to be able to use iostat. Other than that no other changes have been made to the server. EDIT 2 The last entry in the file is 

may not be explicitly helpful in answering your question, but you dont need a GUI to run wireshark. X11 tunneled over SSH would allow you to run the full app remotely. It works well with either cygwin-x or openssh, depending on if you use windows or linux on your desktop. edited: grawity is right, its not port forwarding. 

Reading over (and then testing out on a test database) the setup for mirroring it appears that one is supposed to leave the mirror database in restoration mode for normal operations. is this correct? at whatever point it becomes necessary to initiate the failover (im not using a witness), will the primary database be put into restoration mode? this seems goofy. 

When using HTTPs/TLS/SSL site traffic is encrypted between your browser (or the application initiating the connection) and the web server that is serving pages to you. This means that if any intermediary attempts to "listen" to your requests/responses all they will see is encrypted traffic. This encryption model is the same regardless of whether you are using a VPN or a standard internet connection. 

Rather than copy the MDF files around, a better solution is to take a backup of the database and then restore that backup onto your target SQL instance. Assuming you are using SQL Management Studio, you can do this by right clicking on your database and choosing: 

Theres a huge Wiki article on this here: $URL$ Instead of turning on Rewrite engine a simple html file like: 

if one has a run of singlemode fiber terminated in a patch panel, how would you then connect it over to a device? singlemode patch? it was my understanding that singlemode had minimum refraction distance requirements. 

Im trying to get some users printing from a remote citrix server at another company. It seems as though they require local administrator privileges to do so, however Ive been instructed not to give them that. They can print normally from their desktop without issue. Is there some special permission to allow citrix to print through to local/network printers short of granting local admin to these users? 

It would seem that when I attempt to access my Plesk admin page this is unavailable. After doing some cursory checks I discovered that the server was not listening for incoming requests on port 8443 (verified remotely via telnet). I therefore assumed that the service was not running and therefore issued the following command via SSH under the root account: 

In the list this provides there are a number of modules that I don't immediately recognise, specifically: 

Answering my own question here (which by no means devalues the answer from JakeGould) I have finally found the cause of this, rather than a writeup it is all neatly summarised on this page: $URL$ Using the guidance on that page (and the linked articles) I looked at loaded Apache modules and found mod_view_proxy.so which is not a known Apache Module. This was being loaded into Apache via a LoadModule directive in /etc/httpd/conf.d/perl.conf. All files had been touched so the datetime stamp on them do not look suspicious. As blog entry mentions the SSHD had also been replaced with a different version. As to how it got compromised, not entirely sure - the assumption is that it was caused by running and older version of vBulletin and/or one of its plugins (which is entirely my fault). Also I need to give these guys their dues: $URL$ As you can see from this thread I had exhausted all ideas I had and also my technical ability, so as a last resort I went to Sucuri with everything I knew and had done. Yes, its a paid service but they found the issue, resolved it - their service was fantastic. They were genuinely interested in helping me navigate through this issue, a level service we don't often see these days. I have nothing but praise for them and would not hesitate to recommend them to anybody in my position. 

Not clear from your question, but i think what you want is called multihoming. its trivial in linux. never tried it in windows, but it cant be that difficult. $URL$ Linux (from the wiki article): $URL$ Windows (again, from the wiki article): $URL$ 

why on earth would you have a router using DHCP for addressing? the frequency will depend on the lease its already obtained from the DHCP server. powercycling should also force it to recheck, as will configuring the interface statically and then switching back to DHCP. 

So the short answer is that the temp directory for those users was set to something it shouldnt have been. 

I have been staring at this for a while not I can't fathom it, probably a wood for the trees scenario. I am attempting to use HTACCESS to block certain inputs to a web server, so I have added the following directives: 

I would get a 403 error back, however all I am seeing is page.php. Conclusion is that the directives are malformed and not being followed. Could anybody offer any guidance on where I may have gone wrong? 

I am looking through the modules that my apache server has loaded. To get this list I am using the following command: 

If I attempt to start Plesk with the command I mentioned earlier 2 new entries, the same as the one above, are added to the error log. I have found some reference to this error log entry and these relate to an updated version of SSL breaking plesk, however I have not (to my knowledge) updated SSL (unless the install of sysstat did this in the background??) Output from is: 

1) can it RDP to itself? 2) it sounds like more of a networking issue than an RDP issue, based on the ping problem. have you verified its on the same virtual nic, and that all IP information is correct, including DNS, gateway, netmask, etc? 

Heaviest things in the bottom. This is almost always your UPS. This also means that larger servers need to go in the bottom. This also makes it MUCH easier to install. Instead of having 3 guys hold it up while a 4th screws it in, usually it only takes one person to help you get the first couple screws and after that youre home free Dont use cable management arms - they block airflow. I was a big fan of them until someone pointed that out. Use velcro or zipties to secure your power cables to your power supplies so that things dont jiggle out or get knocked out if someone is working on another system. For a single rack (or even two) mount a switch central to the other devices, facing the rear. even if you have a 42U rack you wont fill up a single 48 port device unless you have ILO/DRAC/etc devices in everything, and then youre going to spend more rack space on the patching equipment anyway. longer cables with velcro will allow you enough distance to pull things out without disconnecting everything and still keep it on the neater side. 

To be honest there are quite literally hundreds, maybe tens, of ways of doing this. Personally I would use a simple batch file that maps a network drive (net use) and then copies the files. Rather than copy or xcopy I would recommend using robocopy as this support functions such as mirroring. As for executing installers, thats a different question entirely. For this you could use remote command (rcmd) to execute the installer once you have copied it across. 

When I perform the backup (initiated via a cron job) I set a .htaccess rule on my site to redirect any requests to a static "down for backup, back shortly" page. Once the backup completes I remove the rule and the site reopens. All well and good, it has been like this for years and as you can imagine this works perfectly well and I haven't had any issues. However... I would like to not have to close the site during the backup, so the question is can I do this with mysqldump? Is the tool capable of handling conditions where data changes after the backup initiates? If it does live backups can I guarantee that I won't get a corrupt backup? Is there a better way of doing a live backup?
