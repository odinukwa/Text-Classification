May be this doesn't exactly answer the question, but pure dental consonants are cross-linguistically rare. Ladefoged and Maddieson discuss in detail how stops which are generally labeled dental, are actually denti-alveolar, with the bulk of the articulation at the alveolar ridge. They also state that for languages that distinguish different types of coronal stops, the actual difference in articulation is caused by tongue shape (laminal versus apical) as opposed to tongue position (dental versus alveolar). The answer by @user6726 notes the Australian aboriginal languages as having distinct dental consonants. Now, I don't know much about Australian languages, in general, but from this Wikipedia article, it seems they too use a laminal and apical distinction. I can, however, vouch for this fact --- as a native speaker --- about the Indo-Aryan languages which have a similar distinction. The so-called retroflexes actually involve curling the tongue back (retroflexing) only in careful and slow speech, or in artificially learned speech (for example, a lot of people learn this careful retroflexed articulation in school, and therefore may have retroflexes in English --- signature Indo-Pakistani accent --- but completely lack retroflexes in their first languages). At least for me, the "retroflexes" 〈ṭ, ṭh, ḍ, ḍh〉 are always apical alveolar (with zero affrication, so they sound quite different from English) and are post-alveolar only inter-vocalically, while "dental" 〈t〉 and 〈th〉 are laminal denti-alveolar and "dental" 〈d〉 and 〈dh〉 are actually laminal alveolar! My point of saying all this is to point out that "dental" is often a placeholder for laminal, and in this sense, I can't imagine a "dental" trill, because I find laminal trills impossible, even though an apical trill is easy to make (regardless of whether its dental or alveolar). The other interpretation of dental consonants may be inter-dental, like English 〈th〉, which are also cross-linguistically rare. The hyperlinked Wikipedia page and this page says it occurs in careful pronunciation for plosives in Australian languages. I can make an inter-dental trill, with the tip of my tongue sticking out and trilling against the sharp edge of the upper incisors, but this doesn't seem to be a very natural (for want of a better word) thing to do. Again (as the other answer mentions), Russian and Hungarian (and Rumanian, which I know very little about) have been claimed to have dental trills (for Russian it is the palatized r), but in both these languages the said trills (at least in my experience) are very often taps, and even then are denti-alveolar. 

Russian ⟨ы⟩ can be a little difficult to master, especially if one wishes for a native-like pronunciation. When stressed, the vowel in question is a : IPA . But, as with all "hard vowels" in Russian, it strongly velarizes any preceding consonant, which manifests as a noticeable glide after the consonant and before ⟨ы⟩. So, ты comes out phonetically as , where is the IPA symbol for the velar approximant – a ⟨w⟩ (as in water) without rounding the lips. This gives ⟨ы⟩ a diphthong-like quality distinct from in many other languages. One thing to note is that Russian speakers maintain the velar approximant before even when pronouncing ⟨ы⟩ in isolation (without any consonant before it to velarize), e.g., when reciting the alphabet. To make , try following the instructions in this video: $URL$ For an English speaker, one way may be to start with something like 'woo', and get rid of the lip-rounding. 

A theta role is a very simple concept: is the name that we give to the relation between an event and an individual participating in that event. How coarse- or fine-grained we want our theta roles to be is a totally different question. I suggest you pick up Heidi Harley's survey article on theta roles (referenced in the Wikipedia entry) and work your way from there. 

There are a few factors that might confound your answer. For example, I'm pretty sure "actively" know several thousand more words than my father does; but then, I have a doctorate and lost count many years ago of how many books I own, whereas my father stopped going to school at age 15 and all the books he owns fit in a single shelf. So that's something you want to control for. If you are going to compare American English against, let's say, Mongolian, differences in education level alone are going to be enough to give you a false positive. Similarly, you want to average across a large cross-section of the population, to avoid effects related to some speakers (e.g., writers, journalists...) having an anomalously large vocabulary. Once you get all those things into account, my best guess is that you won't find any significant differences in vocabulary size. Again to give a personal example, my uncle, who owns a farm, has an "active" vocabulary that includes many dozen words for farming implements, animal parts, different stages in the life of individual animals, types of crops, etc, that I simply do not have in my "active" vocabulary. Similarly, tribal languages of the Amazonian rainforest or the Australian outback lack science- and technology-related words, but they also have words that we lack, related to life in that particular environment.

Lateral (egressive) consonants are made by obstructing the path of the airstream using some part of the tongue and directing it to escape the along the sides of the mouth. This gives lateral approximants like , , etc. their distinctive sound, different than the corresponding central approximants , etc. Of course, the same principle applies to lateral fricatives, affricates and taps, which find use in a lot of languages. However, I have never seen a mention of lateral plosives. To me, it seems that they should exist – at least in principle. In fact, I think I can make what seem to be lateral plosives and even ejectives! So, is there really some physiological reason that makes lateral plosives impossible (i.e., what I am producing are something else), or are they never mentioned because no (living, known, attested, well-documented) language uses them? Along the same lines, I have seen some stuff on laterally released (IPA ) plosives, such as the -ddle in middle . Is this what I am calling a lateral plosive? 

A lot. All Turkic languages (Turkish, Qazaq, Tatar, O'zbek, Sakha etc.), all Uralic languages (Finnish, Sami, Hungarian, Komi, Mari, Nenets etc.), a lot of Indo-Iranian langages (Persian, Sorani Kurdish, Bengali, Ossetic etc.), and many more. All the languages mentioned so far don't have grammatical gender, but even some languages with grammatical gender may fail to have gendered pronouns, for instance, Hindi-Urdu, and Kurmancî Kurdish in the absolutive case. 

How people "feel" (regardless of their first language) can be quite subjective, and in a linguistic context even the word "feel" can have multiple interpretations. As such, a single English-speaker, picked at random, may associate with any of these geographical names a particular gender based on analogy with similar/familiar terms. For example, names of female individuals often (of course, not always) end in (orthographically ⟨a⟩), e.g., Andrea, Antonia, Erica etc., and this may cause some individuals to build a feminine association with names like California or America. [In North Carolina, where I live, I have often heard of people refer to the state as a 'she' or 'her'.] But this should not be taken to imply that such words have a particular gender, since English definitely lacks grammatical gender, except in pronouns, which the answer by @fdb addresses. Now, I don't identify as a native English-speaker, but I do speak English like a native, and more importantly, my first language is genderless (more so than English; we even lack gendered pronouns), and I can vouch for the fact that while I may sometimes refer to a geographical/political location as masculine or feminine, I certainly do not associate with these any notion of actually possessing any biologically female or male attributes, the way I would for human beings or even some animals – at least, not in the way a Russian- or German-speaker would. 

You might want to check Heck & Cuartero 2008 ("Long distance agreement in relative clauses", available from Heck's website) for a description of the pattern, references to previous works, and an analysis that you may or may not agree with. 

Short answer: no. Slightly longer answer: not that we know of. The closest you can get is polysyndetic coordination, which follows the pattern "and A and B". Note that this isn't really circumfixation, it's just each conjunct being preceded by its own instance of "and". A nice example of this is Brad Pitt's speech in Ingloriuous Basterds: 

Your professor thinks that intensifier is a better name for this particular category than adverb is, more or less in the same way that some people still use the somewhat dated substantive instead of the more common noun. This means that he's just taking issue with the names we assign things, not with the actual existence of those things. Your professor believes that the category of adverbs hasn't been properly defined, in the sense that it includes items that are not adverbs. When you correct this mistake, you are left with a different set of lexical items, and he's using the label intensifier to refer to what he believes are the correct items that belong in this category. 

Unaccusativity is a syntactic notion: a predicate has a single argument position. Inchoativity is a semantic notion: a predicate denotes the beginning of an event. Some verbs are inchoative and unaccusative (e.g., the sauce thickened), but this is a coincidence, not a significant fact. 

The closest thing I can think of are honorifics in a number of East Asian languages (most prominently, Japanese, but also Korean and Thai). See, for example, the entry about sonkeigo on wikipedia. Japanese also has a number of suffixes to proper names to indicate respect and deference (e.g., "-sama" 様, roughly translatable as "highly respected"). 

From a purely cognitive point of view, it doesn't really matter how many languages you introduce, or in which order so long as: 

Example: mom's native language is Arabic, dad's native language is Japanese, family is living in Hungary. Each parent is fluent is the other's native language as well as Hungarian. The ideal environment in this household is one in which, when the child is present, the mother speaks exclusively Arabic, the father speaks exclusively Japanese, and they speak exclusively Hungarian when interacting with locals. Here, chances are the child will end up acquiring all three languages simultaneously. Obviously, this is an idealized situation. More common are situations where the parents are not totally fluent in each other's native languages and/or the local language. In these cases, you'll need to adjust a bit, but you'll be fine so long as you keep points 1. and 2. in mind.
