I consider myself an "theist." Therefore, as a theist, my response would be, "there is no argument, I agree with you, God is unfalsifiable." With regards to the skeptic, my answer would be, "allowing a human being to live or die sooner or latter, suffer or not suffer, etc., has nothing to do with God's love for them". God's love for His creation, is independent from what His creation does or does not do! 

I would like to focus only on the question, "whether logic can exist without humans"? The answer depends on how "inclusive" we define "human" and how "limited" we define "logic." If we define human as belonging to "homo sapiens," then the answer is yes, simple logic can exist without humans. It exists in plants and animals - at least at the cellular level. 

Although this answer may be considered "superficial," simplistic, or obvious, at least it will provide another point of view. As I understand it, a "computable number," is a number that can be computed by a "computer". Any physical "computer" has definite limitations. Therefore, any number lying "outside" the computer's limitations, is a non-computable number (by the given computer). All physical computers have limitations, therefore there are non computable numbers. One example of these, is (1)/(0) (one divided by zero). Although most computers are now "protected" from dividing by zero, early computers would "hang for ever" (until you hit reset, or power off), if you somehow made it divide by zero. My interpretation of their "philosophical significance" is that there are " "things" that transcend our capabilities. 

Schrodinger's reasoning is wrong. If instead of "order" he means average, then his reasoning makes more sense. Our senses-brain combination responds/measures the average intensity of what ever we are sensing. Also, our senses only operate over a limited range. This forces a limited resolution capability on our senses. It is well known that the resolution of the testing device (ear, eye, film speed, microscope, oscilloscope, etc.), is what limits the size of the object that can be detected/measured with the given "device". 

In answer to the main question, the answer is yes, truth does not require belief. As to Dr. Tyson's quote, my understanding is that he is comparing Science/Scientific (method), to Religion/Religious (method) of finding the truth. So, under this context, it is true that the Science/Scientific (method) does not require you to believe in it (to get to the truth), like the Religion/Religious (method) does. 

Let me try to clarify the difference. Lets start by assigning a value of -1 to false, and +1 to true, and 0 to something "in between". When someone says something is false, it has only a value of -1. When someone says something is not true, it can have a value not only of -1, but also of 0. Therefore, not true (0, -1) is not the same as false (-1). 

I don't believe the universe obeys, per se, any scientific laws. All, so called, "scientific laws" result from the fact that a large amount of energy was "allowed to escape," thereby creating space, and as some of the energy coalesced - matter. As the space (volume) increased, the energy cooled and formed "particles" with properties resulting from the type, distance, and number of them. It is the geometry of these particles, that dictates the "scientific laws". 

To find the difference (if any), one must start by clearly defining "can't be interacted with" and "don't exist." Can't be interacted with - Not humanly perceivable. Don't exist - the "thing" has no (zero) amount of energy, mass, or matter. With these definitions, it becomes clear that if something does not exist, then it is not humanly perceivable. But if something is not humanly perceivable, it does not mean that it does not exist! So, the difference is that they are not reversible. 

The reason you can not understand the "line of thought," is that you are convinced that a computer "can be programmed to learn... hence 'normative'". It is true that a computer is purely a "causal machine," that's why a computer can not "learn" anything, it can only processes data. Once you realize this, you will understand that because "we are normative creatures, it is impossible to explain our minds in purely causal terms." 

The Universe we live in, had a beginning, it is The Creator that is eternal. If you don't like "Creator", then it is the entity, substance, energy, etc. that is eternal. The Universe was created from this "eternal substance," about 13.7 billion years ago. EDIT: I can think of one way that the world could be thought of as eternally existing. Our world is part of God, God is eternal (always existed), therefore our world is eternal (always existed). An analogy might clarify this. The ocean (liquid water) is God, a small iceberg is the world, and even though the iceberg has a different form, it was created from the same water. So, if you want there is a starting point for the iceberg form, but the water molecules always existed. 

I want to start by saying that I find your main statement, invalid. It is invalid because: a) you provide no evidence that Science "carries so much weight" and b) the evidence you provide for Science being "fallacious," is incorrect. I would like to provide evidence that Science actually carries "a small weight" in Philosophy. One method we can use to determine its importance is to list the various branches/categories of Philosophy: 1 - Aesthetics 2 - Epistemology 3 - Ethics 4 - Law 5 - Logic 6 - Mathematics 7 - Methaphysics 8 - Politics 9 - Science With this list, it is easy to see that Science carries only 1/9 of the "weight" of Philosophy. Although you present a fallacious method, we do not "evaluate the predictive power of a hypothesis through attempted falsification." We actually test a hypothesis by predicting some results which can be measured and verified. If additional results validate the hypothesis, our confidence that the hypothesis is valid increases. There is no fallacy in this method. Although Science is ignored (mostly) in Philosophical debates, it is because it may not be applicable, rather than fallacious! 

To help you resolve your question, you need to understand "logic" and the "cause-effect" order. Using these, then it is very easy to understand that whatever you put last on top of the "something," is that which is on top of the "something." In your particular case, using mayo for "last" and eggs for "something," would result in mayo put on top of eggs. 

To answer the question, one has to make distinction between human logic and Divine Logic. If the question is - is God subject to human logic? The answer is no. If the question is - is God subject to Divine Logic? The answer is yes. Divine Logic is God's Nature. Human logic is what we use to try to understand (give/find meaning to) God and His creation. The best analogy I can come up with is my children and I. There has been a number of times when my children have thought that I was acting illogically. However, this was the result of their limited experience and knowledge of the situation. Similarly, we might think that God is acting illogically (as we understand the situation). However, from the point of view of Divine Logic, it is perfectly logical, but because of our limited knowledge, we don't "see" it. So we conclude that God is not subject to logic! 

A ladder and its rungs are symbols being used to convey the ideas behind, so that the listener can understand the ideas by analogy. One side of the ladder is the "physical" (what can be seen), the other side is the "metaphysical" (what can not be seen), and the "rungs" are the "connections and levels" between both realms. 

I would like to offer another plausible interpretation/explanation for the main Libet result - i.e. that a "deliberate action starts as an unconscious process about 500ms before" the conscious becomes aware of it. Let me start by offering (without proof), that the "conscious" is aware that it takes about 400ms for the signals/commands to the muscles to get executed, and it takes 100ms for the "conscious" to process information. It this is correct, then in any given situation were the "conscious" has to make the "best" decision, as fast as possible, at the last moment possible, the "conscious" has to issue commands to the subconscious processors 400ms ahead of time. This way, the 400ms muscle delay plus 100ms processing time, would make it appear that the decision was made instantaneously. In the alternative, if the "conscious" makes the decision to flee and sends the command to the subconscious processors, it will be at least 400ms before the muscles react, increasing the provability of death. This explanation clearly demonstrates that Libet's 500ms delay has nothing to do with free will! 

The answer is no, and the following example might help. The existence of the universe (F) is sufficient for the existence of humankind (G). The lack of humankind (G) is not sufficient to cause the lack of the universe (F). 

The sequential tossing of a coin creates the impression of "history building." However, if we use the equivalent method, we will clearly see that no history (memory) is built. Let's take the case of tossing one coin 1000 times, the equivalent method would be to toss 1000 coins, one time. With this method, it is clear that no history is built, and if we examine the coins, we should find about 500 heads (or tails)! 

Let's start by defining our space as (3D + 1T). As each of its components grows, our universe "grows." However, at any instant of time, our universe is finite. But, even though it is finite, we can not detect or reach its "border" because we can't see or move in the "fourth dimensional' direction. The best analogy I can give you is: a very thin, transparent balloon, with a virus on its surface. The virus can only see and move North, South, East, and West. So, if you tell it to move Up, it will say, "you mean North?" And no matter how much you explain, it will never comprehend the "Up" direction. In conclusion, although our universe appears infinite, it is finite, but it is also expanding. 

"Nothing," is a word that stands for a "concept," which in turn has different meanings depending on the "degree of nothingness." The degree of nothingness depends on the context under which the word is being used. In the context of a "universe from nothing," it means the absence of anything capable of being observed (directly or indirectly) by human beings. A "lower degree" would be "vacuum," which is the absence of matter/particles. A "higher degree" would be "absolute nothing," which would be the absence of everything - matter, particles, energy, fluctuations, thoughts, supreme beings, a Creator, gods, etc., even and including God! 

Although long and elaborate answers have been provided, I would like to offer a short and simple answer. For me, life begins when an ovum is fertilized. A woman has a choice (the right) to get or not get pregnant. If the woman chooses to get pregnant, then she (by default) has chosen all the consequences that pregnancy brings, namely to do all that she can to bring to fruition the pregnancy. She can no longer choose to do otherwise (abort)! The only exception to this, is if the pregnancy was forced on her. In this case, she does have the option (right) to terminate the pregnancy at the earliest possible time (within the first 3 months seems reasonable). From the above, one can conclude that a woman's choice (right) ends at conception, unless the conception was forced upon her, in which case, she has up to 3 months (after conception) to chose to terminate the conception (pregnancy). 

To obtain an answer, one must first make a distinction between a "computer" and its underlying "implementation." Let me use two examples to make this clear. 

Yes, there are reasons to believe that there are things that science cannot tell us. There are at least two major "sections/areas" that science can not "tell us" anything about them. 1) Anything outside of its domain (ethics, arts, etc.). 2) Anything outside of the "current observable" universe (future scientific discoveries, advances, etc.). 

I am sorry I have to side with your teacher, but the correct answer is 3. This conclusion is obtained by understanding the definition of "too narrow." And that is - if a definition excludes other possible members, then the definition is too narrow. You (correctly) argue that the definition excludes other members (polygons, etc.). Therefore you should have selected the 3rd answer - the definition is too narrow. 

It is very unlikely that you are "just a force of nature." The reason being, is that you have needs. Your needs are the "driving force" that causes you to "make/take actions". Therefore, there are actions that come out of you, and you are the source. 

I value "knowledgeable" persons, which by default, are usually "confident" persons. However, since not all confident persons are knowledgeable, I do not value all confident persons. 

I can find instances where you 3 statements are false. Therefore, to make sure they are true, certain conditions, properties, definitions must be assumed/presumed, causing them to be "theory-laden." Hydrogen gas (an object) falls "away" from the ground. Ice that is constantly cooled, does not melt in the sun(light). People (Plato, Newton, etc.) that have achieved "literary immortality" will never die. 

To be able to answer the question, it needs to be rephrase as follows: If there is (exists) a fundamental law of physics that we can't experimentally prove (its existence?) due to our human limitations, does that make it (the law) false? It should now be clear that there are two questions being made. a) existence?, b) validity? 1. If the law does not exist, then we can not determine its validity. 2. If the law exists, we still can not determine its validity because of our human limitations. In either case, the only thing we can conclude is that we can not determine whether the law is true or false! 

It is my opinion that "consciousness" is the result of neural connections from one part of the brain to another part of the brain, providing "feedback" paths. If these feedback paths are damaged, one would most likely end up "in a comma." If I am correct, then it is possible to have consciousness without thoughts. 

Let me start by saying that I am not a physicalist. However, I do not find the problem of consciousness "hard." I agree that consciousness is explainable in physical terms. My explanation is that consciousness is the result (output) of our brain's comparator "circuits" making a comparison between what our senses are currently sensing and what has been recorded in our memory. If the comparison generates a difference, then we must make a decision to act, or not, on it. As to why some people think one way and others in other ways, it is really simple. Free will, different cultures, different levels of education, intelligence, knowledge, etc..
