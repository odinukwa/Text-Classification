It's easy to think the Black Panther Party(BBP) and the Nation of Islam(NOI) could have been allies given a 20,000 foot view of goals and methods. Both saw themselves as working for the betterment of the oppressed. The NOI which was larger, older and influential on the Black Panther Party; however, significant differences still remained. The BPP had a good track record of working with a broad collection of groups including liberal civil rights organizations which the BPP expressed public disagreement with. The NOI on the other-hand, did not have a good record of working with organizations which it disagreed with, and the Black Panther Party certainly would have fallen into that category. In fact the NOI was openly hostile of other organizations which it disagreed with on ideology and or method. So probable an alliance was unlikely. Primarily though, I don't think the Black Panther Party had confrontations or alliance opportunities with the Nation of Islam due to how small, insular, and far apart geographically both organizations were. Background The Nation of Islam was founded in 1930 out of Detroit Michigan and it's numbers range between 20,000 and 50,000. Small but it's the largest of the two groups. The Black Panther party was founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in October 1966 in Oakland California. It was operational for about 16 years, and while it had international chapters for a time, it remained much smaller than the Nation of Islam. Sources: 1. Nation of Islam 2. Black Panther Party 3.

The majority view in the North from the 1850's was to eliminate the growth of slavery into new territories. These people were not Abolitionists. Abraham Lincoln and his branch of the Republican party was willing to let slavery die a slow and malingering death of 1000 legislative cuts. They were not Abolitionists. The term Abolitionist in the decades prior to the Civil War refers to religious based fire brands of the anti slavery movement and they equated slavery with sin and called for the immediate end of slavery even by violent means from the 1830's to the 1870's. Short Answer: The premier abolitionist organization in the decades leading up to the American Civil war was "The American Anti Slavery Society". By 1838, the society had 1,350 local charters with around 250,000 members. They had held a convention in 1833 and wrote a declaration of beliefs. It calls for the immediate abolition of slavery without terms, and was critical of the efforts of the American Colonization Society. American Colonization Society was resettling free blacks to Liberia. decades later. source. After the Civil War one of the most famous Abolitionists William Lloyd Garrison who had written the organizations declaration of 1830, asserted that the passage of the thirteen Amendment abolishing slavery made continuation of the "American Anti Slavery Society" unnecessary. Wendell Phillips insisting that only the achievement of complete political equality for all black males could guarantee the freedom of the former slaves successfully prevented Garrison from dissolving the society. Only with the ratification of the fifteenth Amendment(February 3, 1870) extending male suffrage to African Americas was passed did the society declare it's mission complete. Longe Answer: While it is true that Abolitionism views changed over the years and it is also true that the theme which unites abolitionist movements over the years was not the call for total equality, but rather the call for the abolition of slavery. The demonstrated history of the abolitionist movement in the US was much broader more practical and more persistent than those which advocated deportations/repatriation. And those who called themselves Abolitionists in the decades before the Civil War, were not associated with the deportation/repatriation movement. Founding Fathers The first Abolitionist action in the United States were oddly performed by two slave holders. Thomas Jefferson who owned more than 100 slaves at the time in his original draft of the Declaration of Independence included a paragraph about Great Britain being the origins of slavery and adding it to the causes for the Declaration. This paragraph obviously was excluded in the final draft. Benjamin Franklin, another former slave holder was a prominent member of Pennsylvania Abolition Society April 14, 1775, recognized as the first abolitionist organization in the United States. Following the Revolution Following the American Revolutionary War, Northern states abolished slavery, beginning with the constitution of Vermont in 1777, followed by Pennsylvania's gradual emancipation act in 1780. New York and New Jersey followed this precedent of gradual emancipation in 1804. 

All of these innovations Alexander the Great inherited from his father Philip. Where as most Greek Armies were made of only one type of Unit, like the Spartans of the time only used the Phalanx, The Macedonians had many types of units. They could use different units depending upon which kind of enemy troops they faced and the properties of the terrain they were fighting on. If it was wooded or rocky terrain, phalanx were dangerous to use because they would be forced apart and thus were vulnerable. They could also bog down and become very slow moving as the phalanx struggled to stay together. The Macedonians mixed units could better exploit these difficulties and counter with light infantry, horse archers or heavy calvery. The Macedonians typically had several versions of each specialized type of unit and this gave them options which few armies in antiquity could counter. 

Why were the Japanese military fatality rates so high during WWII against the United States. Because from the American perspective of the period, those are the kinds of seeds the Japanese sowed and that's the resulting harvest the Japanese reaped. 

It was a power move. A way to exploit the rules in their favor. Congress for the first 50 years of the Union did not say exactly when you had to select your electors, there was a window. South Carolina would postpone their selection until near the end of that window. In a tight race, the combination of selecting near the end of the process and the state legislature controling the selection allowed South Carolina's politicians a greater ability to effect the race. This allowed them to make deals, barter, and generally have an overly representative voice in national politics. At least it's a strategy for such. 

The Cold War did involve direct military conflict between the super powers. Those confrontations were just contained and covert and in many cases are still not publicly acknowledged. From what we do know about such direct cold war confrontations, mostly coming from Russia David French's numbers are pretty close. However, given many such actions are still unknown to the public, there is reason to suspect his numbers are low. The Cold War was not called cold because it didn't involve shooting wars. It was called cold because both super powers took measures to cover-up their direct involvement in wars in which the other was publicly participating. Both parties struck at each other clandestinely, mostly with weapons and training but also with military participation. The Cold War involved dozens of proxy wars in which millions of people died. The most famous of these proxy wars were Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan but there were dozens more. In some of these proxy wars it was not uncommon for US and Soviet militaries to come into direct military conflict for years at a time. If these are the deaths that you are speaking of the answer is not entirely understood because for fear of escalation neither side acknowledged their casualties or even their involvement. Public knowledge of those incidents are thus limited even today. Just in the Korea War alone the Soviet Union lost 282 to 316 pilots and airmen in struggling with the American Air Force for air superiority over North Korea. Soviet Combat Losses 282-316 Soviets Lost in the Korean War(1950-1953) 13 Soviets Lost in Vietnam (1964 to 1973) 60 Egypt 1956 - 1974(!) 35 Syria 1956 - 1991(!) (!) Unknown American involvement. Korea and Vietnam were wars in which the United States was fighting and the Soviet involvement was clandestine. During the Cold War their were many such wars, and many where the Soviets were publically fighting and the American Military involvement remains classified. Take Afghanistan for instance where the Soviets lost about 14,453 soldiers. The full story of American involvement remains classified. Korea
