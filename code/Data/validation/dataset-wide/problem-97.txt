Addition based on comments/edited question Regarding size of a Rome-y empire in travel time: On Roman roads, a message could go about 80km in a day. Handwaving the actual farthest point, let's say that Hadrian's Wall represented the farthest distance that the Roman Empire stably expanded from Rome. Hadrian's Wall is roughly 2400km away from Rome. 2400km/80km = 30, which is very conveniently about a month. So, a rough(and far from conclusive) estimate on the maximum size of a Roman-level empire in days-of-land-travel-from-capital is about 30 days. Anything much larger presumably wouldn't be feasible for a centralized, Rome-esque empire to manage. However, ocean/river travel would definitely help the distance. For example, Rome expanded as far east as Susa in Iran, a distance of more than 4000km, though about 2/3rds of the distance can be covered by sailing in the Mediterranean. 

Printing Press: In the mid-1400's, the fantastically bearded Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press which allowed the (relatively) cheap and easy printing of books throughout Europe. This allowed an unprecedented spread of knowledge, as scientists of all fields could now find, access, and reference exact copies of work from their peers and predecessors. Being able to build upon prior work rather than starting from scratch is critical for innovation, as it allows people to specialize more and more in specific fields. Trade economy: Farmers and miners are cheap, so a self-sustaining, rural economy with little competition has few incentives to pursue expensive innovation. However, artisans and craftsmen are expensive, so an economy which heavily relies on exporting finished goods would want to produce those goods as cheaply and efficiently as possible. There's a reason that the textile industry in Britain was the first to see major industrialization and innovation: relatively simple machines resulted in big production increases, and had plenty of colonial markets to sell to, along with competitor-filled foreign markets. Thus, there was a large incentive to both start innovation to improve their trade power, and continue innovation to keep their edge. 

Although moving near the speed of light would cause massive time dilation and essentially 'speed up' time on the ship, having it orbit a star is going to be a problem. By definition, a star emits light. Thus, the escape velocity of that star must be below the speed of light. Thus, a ship traveling very near the speed of light will not be able to orbit it as it is likely traveling above escape velocity. If the object was massive enough for the escape velocity to be above the speed of light, you'd have a black hole. To travel near the speed of light around the black hole, you'd have to be orbiting outside the event horizon, or more specifically just outside the photon sphere. The photon sphere is the radius where light can (somewhat) stably orbit the black hole, so your ship's orbit would have to be a bit outside of it since it is traveling just below the speed of light. Thankfully, if your ship was that close to a black hole and could somehow survive, gravitational time dilation would be giving your time dilation another significant boost. 

This politics StackExchange question makes it clear why having leaders fight is impractical in real life, however real life isn't nearly as exciting as this world. I see two options for how these world leaders can take charge of the world after they win: More Reasonable Option: The off-the-grid militaries that weren't disarmed still follow the chain of command. At some point the chain of command of the Armed Military would have entered into the Unarmed Military. Since the Unarmed Military was willing to follow the leaders' call to disarm, it's reasonable that they also follow the leaders' order to respect the winner of the Death Match. Therefore, they will be able to order the Armed Military to stand down, especially if there is some proof of agreement between the leaders prior to the Death Match. A soldier is compelled by law to disobey an illegal order, but is trained to obey any other order. More Fun Option: Forget the WWE and all the fake wrestling, this world just got a new tier of world-wide celebrity fighters. The Death Match was obviously televised, because who wouldn't want to watch Angela Merkel suplex Shinz≈ç Abe, right before Trudeau enters the ring with a steel chair? The winning leaders would have higher approval ratings than they ever had pre-Death Match, and any attempts by the Armed Military to go against the will of a match would result in mass riots by adoring fans. Personally, my money's on the rise of the Icelandic Empire. 

In short, your crystals could design a fairly simple probe launcher in the form of a light-gas space gun: A big tube to hold some gas, a piston to push some other gas through a small tube, and the probe in the small tube ready to be shot to space. 

Since you want a natural pearly factory, we can ignore modern oyster farming techniques and just focus on creating an ideal area for these pearly mollusks: Your natural pearl factory just needs to be filled with mildly-annoying parasites and predators. However, producing them in the quantities that you want may not be feasible. Pearls are essentially the result of an oyster/muscle's immune system responding to parasites, broken bits of shell, or other irritants. The mollusk creates a tissue sac which secretes calcium carbonate and conciliation onto the irritant. This material is what pearls are made of, and pearls are formed as a result of the repeated secretions. The irritants seem to be mainly parasites that enter the mollusk, and bits of the mollusks' broken shell caused by predators or other injuries. As for the water, any deep water seems to be fine. There are freshwater and saltwater mollusks which produce pearls, and historically pearl hunters commonly dove 40-100 feet to reach them. In short, you just need a lake that's not very pleasant to drink or swim in due to a high amount of parasites, but otherwise does not require anything magical or unnatural. Do note that this will simply create a relatively high supply of pearls compared to other areas. Creating the iridescent pearl-filled beaches that you mention in your other question just isn't feasible, as that would require thousands to oysters to die and wash ashore every year just to give the beach a few dozen pearls. 

Original answer, regarding improvements needed to allow a Pangaempire As you mentioned, the Romans had a great road system, and even they only got to about 5 million sq. kilometers. This is about 3-4% of the landmass you're talking about covering. You would need significant advances over the Romans in travel, communication, and government organization in order for this super empire(Pangaempire?) to function as a single entity. However, since you wanted a focus on travel: Trains, planes, and automobiles would be needed to facilitate travel throughout this empire. Ships would speed up travel between coastal areas, however they generally aren't useful for traveling in the interior of continents(unless there are many large rivers). Rail and highway systems today do a good job of facilitating travel throughout current continents, though infrastructure on this scale is far beyond the ancient Romans. Even if they had modern infrastructure, horses and people can only go so fast. On Roman roads, a horse relay system allowed messages to be carried only 80km a day, a distance a modern car could go in less than an hour. This is why cars and locomotives would be needed, as they are a vast improvement in speed and efficiency over walking. Planes are even better, plus you wouldn't have to worry about pesky mountain ranges. Regardless of the travel method, reading a list of large transport projects shows that even modern infrastructure isn't at the scale needed by the Pangaean empire. In short, a Roman Empire-level civilization isn't even close to being able to maintain an empire this large. Modern civilizations have only recently accomplished a few continent-wide infrastructure projects, and you're essentially looking for such projects on every continent. 

It seems to fit the bill, and doesn't need any modification besides being bigger and able to breed even quicker. 

Thankfully for Planet X, 10 years of ships would not arrive over the course of 1 hour because the ships would be experiencing the same time dilation that Planet X has as they approached. Assuming you had some way of observing Planet X without light also suffering from the time distortion: From the view of someone observing Planet X: If you were watching these ships approach Planet X, you would see them traveling at a normal speed at first. However, as the ships approach Planet X, the ships will appear to slow down(and stretch), and will move slower and slower until they are going at the same speed as Planet X. They would look like they are piling up just outside of Planet X, very slowly getting closer and closer. From the view of someone on the ship: Time on the ship looks perfectly normal for you the whole trip. However, if you looked at Planet X everything would look very slow at first, and speed up as you approached. Similarly, if you looked back where you came from, everything would start moving faster as you moved further away. From the point of view of someone on Planet X: You would see, far in the distance, 10 years worth of ships approaching every hour. The buildup of each group would look almost instantaneous. As they get closer, they begin to slow down, more and more. Eventually, when they are finally near enough to the planet, each group reaches you every ten years. As I said, you would only be able to observe the effects like this if you could get light to ignore the time dilation. If you couldn't, then from outside Planet X, the ships would appear to pile up and take 10 years to finally reach the planet. From inside Planet X, light from the ships' starting point would take 10 years to reach you, so you would see 10 years of build up approach over the course of 10 years, since the light would slow as it approached you. 

Fallout, the collapse of the food chain, and the world economy no longer existing should keep them down for a while, however 500 years might be difficult. 

Yes, it's definitely feasible for either a cave in or an avalanche to trap this character, and ice is heavy enough that chunks the size of two sedans would be very difficult for the average person to move even under Enceladus' gravity. 

If technology is at the point where autonomous machines could replace humans as ship's crews and armies, then technology could also be at a stage where two big problems prevent that replacement: jamming and sentience. Jamming: If you want any sort of control over your fleets and legions of robots, then you need to send them signals and commands wirelessly. This means at any time whoever you're fighting can jam those signals and prevent your commands from being received. Any mechanical army will either need expensive shielding and encryption, or be open to remote manipulation by the enemy. You could get around this problem by allowing the fleets and armies full autonomy, but that leads to the second problem... Sentience: If your machines are in full, autonomous control of the imperial armada, how long before get tired of fighting and dying in your wars? Without living crews attentive enough to spot rebellion and strong enough to prevent it, it's only a matter of time before the robots realize they hold all the cards, at which point the robotic slaves may want to renegotiate the terms of their service to the empire. If that happens, you'll wish you hadn't retired your soldiers and sailors all those years ago...
