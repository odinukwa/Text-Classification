My suggested rule is: 1) A supervisor should be a co-author in a paper taken from a student's thesis if she has contributed substantially to the research 2) A supervisor should not be a co-author in a paper taken from a student's thesis if she has not contributed substantially to the research There are different styles of supervisions among different people. (And also for the same supervisor in case of different students.) A style where the supervisor and the student conduct joint research is certainly legitimate and it has various advantages. In such a case it is more likely that there will be a joint paper written. (But also in such cases, if the supervisor's contribution to the actual research is not substantial then the supervisor should not be a coauthor.) 

Background and motivation The Borsuk conjecture (disproved in 1993) asserted that every set of diameter 1 in $R^d$ can be covered by $d+1$ sets of smaller diameter. Since every $d$-polyope has at least $d+1$ facets our proposal is indeed a weaker statement. My motivation for this question comes from the paper Semidefinite Extended Formulations: Exponential Separation and Strong Lower Bounds by Samuel Fiorini, Serge Massar, Sebastian Pokutta, Hans Raj Tiwary and Ronald de Wolf. The paper solves an old conjecture of Yannakakis about projections of polytopes and shows, in particular, that the $n$-dimensional cut polytope cannot be described as a projection of a polytope with only a polynomial number (in $n$) of facets. Another proof of this result of Fioroni et als. (regarding cuts polytopes) will follow from an affirmative answer of a slight strengthening of the proposed problem: Problem: If $P$ is a $d$-polytope of diameter 1 with $n$ facets then $P$ can be covered by $n$ sets of diameter $1-\epsilon$ wher $\epsilon$ may depend on $n$ (but not on $P$.) 

Very late addition (August '13) J. J. Sylvester, Thoughts on inverse orthogonal matrices, simultaneous sign-successions and tesselated pavements in two or more colors, with applications to Newton rule, Ornamental tile-work, and the theory of numbers. Phil Mag 34 (1867), 461-475. This title is unbeatable! Late addition (March, '13): Long and Wigderson's " How discreet is the discrete log?." Gale and Shapley's "College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage, " was a great title to a great paper. (link JSTOR) "Moments in mathematics" Papers from the American Mathematical Society annual meeting held in San Antonio, Tex., January 20â€“22, 1987. Edited by Henry J. Landau. (Link: Google book) This is about "moments" in the technical sense but the double meaning of the title is very cute. (There is also a book entitled "great moments in mathematics" with the ordinary meaning of moments.) About 1-2 decades ago Sylvain Cappell and Shmuel Weinberger planned writing a book called "A piece of the action" about group actions. This is a memorable title but I think the book was not completed. One obvious: Aigner and Ziegler's Proofs from the book. (Link: WikipediA) Joel Spencer's title "Six standard deviations suffice." is also memorable. (Link: JSTOR) Jack Edmonds',(1965) "Paths, Trees and Flowers". (Link: ps file.) For some reasons I found the title "Defect Sauer results" of a paper by Bollobas and Radcliffe memorable. (Link) Branko Grunbaum has a paper entiled "The importance of being straight" (I could not find a link), and Irit Dinur and Shmuel Safra have a paper entitled "On the importance of being biased". (A link to a later version with a different title.) (There is a paper by A. Dillof published in Michigan Law Review with very similar name.) Jorg Wills had a memorable title "decomposable skeleta" for a paper he sent for the 100th birthday of a well known mathematician. But I think at the end he changed the title. Saharon Shelah has several memorable titles like this one: "On what I do not understand (and have something to say). I" .Although, I forgot the most memorable one. 

Maybe I should start by saying that the quote from Cook is convincing. If a useful polynomial time algorithm for NP complete problem will be found then a computer will be able to give us quickly proofs for theorems (admitting not too long proofs) that we are interested to prove (and may eventually prove), as well as much harder questions that we are uninterested to prove and it seems that we will never be able to prove. (Is the shortest proof of FLT has an even number of characters?) This automatic ability to prove may lead to much more understanding of mathematical theorems and phenomena. We can explore if a specific direction to a proof works, try all sort of lemmas. explore surprising connections, etc. This picture gives good reason to believe that $P \ne NP$ but there are even better reasons for that. There are various reasons to believe that $NP \ne P$ and indeed one reason is that various tasks that look intractable will immediately look much easier compared to what we experience and expect. The connection with proving specific mathematical theorems looks artificial from various reasons. Usually, to transform a mathematical task into a decision problem to which the NP=?P problem is relevant we need to add a statement like "Is there a proof for RH with less than n pages". This addition makes the original problem much harder. We have a proof for FLT but probably we will never be able to answer the question "what is the smallest number of characters in a proof of FLT?". Fortunately we find the later question uninteresting. So overall Cook's statement can be seen as a provocative agument for why $NP \ne P$, which has some merit, But I dont think it offers any useful connection, One argument against the connection of real life mathematical proofs and the NP/P gap goes as follows. The NP/P problem is about the effort needed to find a proof compared to the effort needed to verify a proof. Now think about ourselves as computational devices and about this gap for cases of proven theorems. Try to estimate the amount of effort that it takes you to verify a proof which capture n journal pages (or n words) compared to finding such a proof. Is it superlinear in n? more than Quadratic in n? This gap (sometimes referred to as the creativity gap) does not seem similar to the gap between finding a proof and verifying a proof in the NP/P theory (say, the gap between finding a hamiltonian cycle in a large graph or verifying that a certain list of vertices and edges form a Hamiltonian cycle.) We can also talk bout the human effort needed to produce an n-page (or n characters) proof. This effot is on average (for cases of success) probably monotone in n, perhaps superlinear in n but there is no reason to expect it to be exponential in n. Just to make the main point clear: Deciding mathematical problems including famous ones appears to be by far easier than solving NP-complete problems, and therefore the $NP \ne P$ by itself seems to offer little explanation for the difficulty in solving mathematical problems. But computational complexity insights do give some understanding of this difficulty. You could have asked a similar question about computability. Does the fact that there are mathematical statements that are undecidable give some explanation why some mathematical conjectures are so hard to prove? (Well, it gives some indirect explanation of a sort, but not a real useful connection.) It is an interesting question why proving mathematical conjectures does not seem to be computationally intractable at least for surprisingly many cases where people succeeded. (Also undecidability enters the scene rather rarely.) I am not aware of a very good answer to this question. It may have something to do with what we regard as "interesting" in mathematics, to the nature of mathematical understanding, and to the highly structured nature of mathematical problems. 

A few more remarks, On the bright side: To determine if a given graph is the graph of a d-polytope is decidable. Tarski's algorithm for real closed fields can be used. In dimension 3 as Sam Nead mentioned graphs of 3-polytopes are precisely 3 connected planar graphs. The algorithm by Hopcroft and Tarjan and various subsequent algorithms give a linear-time algorithm for planarity. Regarding the second question, it is possible that the same graph can be realized as the graph of d-polytopes of various dimensions. David already mentioned K_n which is the graph of a d-polytope for every d between 4 and n-1. Another example is the graph of a d-cube which was proved by Joswig and Ziegler to be a graph of e-polytopes for e between 4 and d. Another fact is that there are not so many graphs of polytopes. There are only exponentially many different graphs of simple d-polytopes with n vertices. See this paper of Benedetti and Ziegler. It is not known if this result extends to graphs of general d-polytopes, or to all subgraphs of graphs of simple d-polytopes, or to dual graphs of all triangulations of (d-1)-spheres. The later question is discussed by Gromov in the paper spaces and questions (p. 33).
