I am having a maintenance plan configured with Windows Authentication being run by an SQL Server Agent job with owner 

What is the possible use of owner of an SQL Server Agent job, I wonder? Removed, and left it blank and the job still succeeds

Online MSDN article "Execute Statements Against Multiple Servers Simultaneously (SQL Server Management Studio)" (SQL Server 2012) states: 

In SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Ed., which index types do not support online index rebuilds? and why? and which activity-operations can prevent online index rebuilds? 

Also, a book on SQL Server 2012 I am reading tells me that in such situation I should see (to choose) "SQL Server Database project" template (which is absent in my case) When I launch VS2012 --> choose New Project , I see SQL Server Database project template 

Invalid class (System.Management) 3) Ensure the agent startup account for 'Master-Server-Name' has rights to login as a target server (if Success here, then 4) is error or both 3) and 4) are errors) 

incur limitations on the whole server, the instance of server or specific database created as contained one? Apparently, it is only to contained database but, then, why it should be enabled server-wide first? and what does it incur (for example, if I enable it on server but did not enable it on any particular database)? 

I'm running mongo 3.4.7 (WiredTiger) replica set with two secondaries. According to the docs, when journaling is enabled and write concern is , the ack is sent after the data is written to "In memory". However the docs don't specify what happens when journaling is off on the server (). What happens in that case? What is the write concern waiting for? 

I'm seeing this kind of report in many JIRA bugs and I want to generate it for my mongo instance. What software was used for generating it? 

We have a cluster of 3 Mongo 3.2.13 instances running with journaling enabled, with hundreds of DBs and collections which are accessed simultaneously. We are checking the option to disable journaling, to improve the cluster's performance. According to the docs, WiredTiger performs a checkpoint every 60 seconds, so in a case of crash we should only loose up to 60 seconds of data. We are ok with that. Are there any other risks / disadvantages for disabling journaling? 

I'm running MongoDB 3.4.7 cluster (primary + 2 secondaries). Primary's cache usage is 95%, and I try to figure out what the cache contains. I ran collStats for all collections (±18,000) and summarized the "bytes currently in the cache" metric. The total is ±16GB, which is only about half of the cache size (which is 30GB). When running db.serverStatus(), there seems to be two relevant metrics: 

I'm running a mongo 3.4.7 cluster (8 CPU, 120GB ram, primary + 2 secondaries) with ±130 open connections, each one of them to a separate DB with ±50 collections. After a few minutes of running, cache usage percent goes to 95% and stays there. Sometimes is goes down a bit to ±93%, but quickly returns to 95%. According to the docs, when cache usage is at 95%, WiredTiger will start using application threads for eviction, which slows down the DB and can explain why cache usage doesn't get higher than 95%. What is the reason that cache eviction can't keep up with the load, while machine resources are under-utilized (CPU, Disk)? Tried increasing the number of eviction threads to the maximum of 20, no luck there. Update: Here are the result of 

The rebuild of indexes takes appr. the same 55 min. with both "Do not rebuild indexes and "Rebuild indexes offline" "For index types that do not support index rebuilds" with "Keep index online while reindexing" checked 

Though, I removed any CMS (Central Management Server) instance and still getting the same results over multiple SQL Servers on 2 differing machines 

Whom does Windows Authentication of a maintenance plan authenticate, for whom and for what - why is it needed and/or how can it be used? To which user I should give permissions for accessing backup (being stipulated in maintenance plan) dir location? And how does the owner of an SQL Server Agent job enter into all this considering that an owner has SQL Server authentication? 

In all cases I was using a domainUser login with sysadmin role for setting SQL Server Agent service and owner of an SQL Server Agent job (or, in the latter, tried also ), Windows Authentication to in used by them maintenance plans. The used domainUser is part of (local) Administrators group in each of the Windows (machines). The SQL Server Management Studio is run . How can I troubleshoot these errors? What should I check and look for? Specifically, I do not quite understand: 

On Windows 7 Prof I have installed SQL Server 2012 R2 with, as I am pretty well remember, client tools. Then, I tried to install Visual Studio 2013 Ultimate but failed. Then I've installed VS2012 Prof (30-day trial). Now, on launching SQL Server 2012 (i.e. VS2010 Shell)) Data Tools --> New Project I am getting: 

Invoice number Date Requester Reference code 1 Reference code 2 Purchase order code purchase order date Credit terms(days) Bill to ( Company Name, City , Country , Zip code , Telephone ) Ship to ( Company Name, City , Country , Zip code , Telephone ) Items ( there will be more than one items ) [ Item Name, Item Description, Unit of Measurement , Quantity , Unit Price ] Total amount Terms and Conditions ( this will be a 3 line sentence, it can be anything , it will be a text .. example below ) [ stock available/ not available / 2 -3 weeks delivery period / cash on delivery / 35 days credit ] Created by 

As you can see both the quote and invoice has lot of similar columns , how can I make normalized table in sql for the above. I am guessing there will be quote table, item table , customer table and invoice table. But in that case there will be duplicate datas in both quote table and invoice table [ example , total amount is same, terms and condition is same , requester is same etc.. ]. What the application will do is , when the user press 'add quote' , a tab opens with fields and the user can input all the above(quote) variable/columns. And once he is done he can save it , in that case the variables it will be saved in the database in respective tables, later once the client approves the quote, the user can go to the list of quotes section and can press the action button to convert this quote to an invoice, when the user press the action button a new tab opens with the invoice format style, most of the fields will be automatically filled from the database, the remaining fields like [ purchase order number, purchase order date etc.. ] he will have to enter. I guess I have explained what I am trying to do. What I am hoping from you all as help is the SQL statement for creating the table or at-least an idea of how many tables do I need and what all will be the foreign keys, may be ERD diagram with entities. Making the tables 3NF , so there will be no duplications, trying to save the database space.
