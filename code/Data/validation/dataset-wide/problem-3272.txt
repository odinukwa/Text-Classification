It seems further complicated by the fact that any regulations were held to be important but lousily enforced. More important than to really keep certain people out for good seems the aspect of keeping them separate from the good people: 

The "if history is any guide" part is an allusion to mostly alleged famous events. Like The Rape of the Sabine Women or the Trojan War. Not 30 million, just one woman missing is reason for war. Right? Or, just one male too many, if you look from the other side. But investigating this claim as a historian by looking at real events this theory becomes much less convincing. From a population conservation or population growth perspective, unmarried males are a non problem. Women are the scarce resource here. Being pregnant, giving birth, nursing children takes time, time in which a single male can father dozens of offspring. Unmarried women have seldom caused a reason for concern, the words like spinster are testament to that. But unmarried males are seen as much more aggressive, especially when young, in this case of a hypothesis primarily due to sexual frustration. But that is the problem of oversimplification. This is not all about sex, but it is about age, and it is indeed about frustration. Frustration stemming from a lack of a promising future perspective, and not just marital bliss, but economical as well. And whether we ask Marx or Clinton: "it's the economy, stupid!" Let's not forget that sexual frustration is easily solved by a number of means with varying degrees of historical precedence and current success: prostitution, gay marriage, the internet, and sex-robots. More seriously but less practical one might look to Freud's theory of sublimation. The real theory behind males waging war is the so called Youth bulge theory, first formulated by Fuller after ideas from Gaston Bouthoul and expanded by Gunnar Heinsohn: 

It was a very richly decorated building. I would say: it still is. Architectural simulations of the kind depicted in the question are obviously far from complete. But the complete lack of images, while the ornaments were taken into account, might also indicate an (idealised?) muslim stage of the structure as the goal. But the rendering is very likely just incomplete, because even today not only are some of the icons visible but also the ornaments that did survive were not taken into account in that simulation: 

One old description emphasising an important aspect – also of interior decoration – of how it looked is found in Prokop: 

There is some difficulty in how the term nation is defined and used here. Mainly adding to Alex' answer: It might be argued that Austria was an entity that was in modern times forced out of its home nation (whatever 'Germany' was at that time) three times additionally to what Alex identified! Austria has been a member of the Holy Roman Empire from its inception. It was forced out of this Reich first by Napoleon in 1806, then by Bismarck in ~1866–71, (then Austria-Hungary collapsed,) and then by the allies after World War I in 1919 again: 

What is today understood as a 'hospital', not a little private clinic, seems to be a much later invention. Though still in 'Roman times' much of the above is true as early as the early republic, hospitals seem to belong into late antiquity. 

The type of wood seems veneer. More general background for the financial and economic situation of and in Austria shortly after the war is at Notgeld 1918-1924. Heller is the 100th part of the official currency Krone during the Habsburg monarchy backed by gold. These pieces were issued locally by an industrialist who had an ample supply of wood in Zell (now Bad Zell). Inflation in Austria began much earlier than in Germany. In Austria the value of the Krone went down from the start of the war and reached 1500% by the end of the war compared to 1914 (officially the German Mark just had a rate of 200% up to 1918). This type of money was in official circulation until Oktober, 1st 1921, but lost any real world value before that date. 

For a modern mathematical examination of wood types have a look at those characteristics which may have mattered more to the Persians, bow wood, and see that there are differences, but on a relatively smooth spectrum. The high specific gravity of cornel wood is in many ways a disadvantage. Using another type of wood would present only different trade-offs but might not be regarded as wholly inferior in every aspect. 

However, using an equivalent of the Big-Mac-Index you might arrive at a somewhat reasonable comparison: 

The whole affair started in the early morning hours of September 5th, 1972 and was essentially over the next day. In a situation of extremely high tension, with wholly unexpecting and generally unprepared officials and organisational structures that are now seen as completely ineffective and unsuitable: that is quite a short time to react. As explained in the Wikipedia article, one, if not the main concern publicity wise was that these were supposed to be "friendly" games, in a "changed Germany" (no, I will not mention the war.) This attitude lead to the deployment of mostly unarmed and even largely un-uniformed police during the games. And just as "nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition" nobody thought of bad guys turning up at such a type of event, ever. Using the army "for internal affairs" was indeed strongly prohibited at the time by the basic law. Having specialists from the military resign and sign up immediately with the police would be quite a "dirty trick", manoeuvring like this would have been time consuming as well as unattractive for anyone involved. 

Remember that the traditional story follows Eusebius's account of complete and thorough conversion, suddenly and absolutely, in 312! The archaeological reality of the evidence found is just not compatible with this pious narrative. 

Summary These are largely the official numbers that were planned to be granted to the populace, slightly corrected to actual calories delivered on average mainly for the urban consumers. While many people did die from malnutrition and starvation, these numbers were not as low across the board for all. The former and future elite, the very thrifty and the rural citizens did a bit better than these numbers suggest. 

The games were introduced as a spectacle as a funerary rite. That brings up a connection to fossores. But apart from poorer parts of society having to dig there own graves, the gravediggers were quite a proud people and not of such a low rank as genrally imagined. Reading Juvenal describing senatorial women running off with these lowlifes for better sexlifes is quite indicative of the ambivalent attributes; that is of both women and gladiators. Prohibiting senators from fighting gladiators in the arena seems also less concerned about the well being of the aristocrats than to enforce status boundaries. 

Although this is getting a bit lengthy already and prone to misunderstandings, the following from the same page has to be quoted as well: "But the fact that there was no progress––far too little to have any systematic impact on life expectancy––and the fact that medical intervention did more harm than good, does not mean that doctors did not cure patients. " 

Notice the fat colourful lines that cross ancient, 19th, 20th century, and present day borders. Even today people from both sides of the border between Germany and the Netherlands understand each other much better than Bavarians can understand Friesian people. Swabians today advertise jokingly their inability to speak proper standard high German. Calling Germany a more homogenous country is quite misleading. A Germany based on ethnicity according to nationalism would incorporate much more of the Netherlands and Belgium, Switzerland, Bohemia and the whole of Austria. But going by linguistic borders alone could arguably also lead to splitting Germany into several pieces, since East-Netherlands and Northern Germany as well as Bavaria and Austria are in two separate but very smooth continua. Culturally, language is not the only divide to observe. Even religiously German speaking countries remain split – or perhaps more accurate: very thoroughly mixed up: So the second main difference between Germany and Austria-Hungary is that Germany could have and should have been dismantled much more. But the French were not allowed to have it their way. Nor the Polish or the Czech were allowed to have it all their way by the other powers. Not because of anything about language or nationality or self-determination. Those concepts only mattered in rhetoric not in actual aims, plans or interests. 

In other words, periods are times of divergence, evidenced by a multitude of finds with stylistic variations. Horizons are times of convergence, evidenced by a multitude of finds with stylistic similarities. That means that in the Preceramic Period, starting at around 9500 BCE, human presence is evidenced. Human presence = culture, even if a specific name might be missing. But using this very early reference point might be overzealous for tracing the origin of the Incas'. These terms just defined are of archaeological origin. While we should still keep in mind that: 

Concentrating on culturally defining aspects we can then say: Those who wrote and re-wrote the Torah were mainly exilic and post-exilic Israelites, or rather their priestly and royal servants – a small elite – compiling some older stuff from often oral traditions and interweaving a lot of new material to form a belief system and legitimacy for their religious and regal power structures. The beginning of Israelite ethnogenesis is tied to the great bronze age collapse. Canaanite city states and their political and cultic system, largely under Egyptian control, broke down. Fleeing or emigrating Canaanites from those cities started to settle in the central highlands and joined nomads and pastoralists there, seemingly adopting a much simpler lifestyle, all of them still being clearly the offspring of the previous cultures and ethnicities. When this process came to a stage as definitely recognisable in archaeological remains is debatable, but Finkelstein sees the Omride dynasty as the first point in time where biblical narrative and physical evidence start to match in any way. That means that this process took from the great collapse already mentioned until the early iron age and first manifests itself in the archaeological record with very sparse settlements and later gave rise to the original state of Israel, the so called Northern Kingdom. The self consciousness and image of that people is hard to define, since most of what we have as historians is the first part of the Bible. That book heavily distorts the picture and mostly paints an idealistic, programmatic picture, resembling more a vision than a fact. Our texts are portraying strict monotheism, but at the same time they are retaining hints of different, polytheistic people (the normal population, the 'sinners'), matching up the condemnation of idols and heights with a huge number of material finds in terms of statues and figurines of gods and holy places and their markers in stone. In reality the borders and cultures, and the borders of culture where much more in flux and weakly defined. One of the most prominent features to observe is that while the Philistines in what is now the South of the modern day state of Israel ate really a lot of pork, the Israelites in what is now considered Palestinian territory started to avoid pigs. The most sensible guess here is that this was one of the first identity markers that separated early Israelites from their surroundings in the early iron age.
