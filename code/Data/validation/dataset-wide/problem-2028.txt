I worked at some point for a large (public) organization that allowed quite a lot of flexibility. Everybody would get a standard Windows machine (with a few options available) and for everything else, you had to find your own budget and write a short motivation (because the main provider had to be chosen through an EU tender procedure). Support was not guaranteed but generally accommodating. It sounds a bit vague as a policy but that's pretty much how it worked in practice: For example, support for printing, etc. was not as good on Macs but someone did take care of it eventually. I don't know how much of this translates to your situation but that's one way to do it. 

Other answers have already listed several reasons to list your current job but I would like to add another one. I think it's pretty well established that people who have been unemployed for some time have a very hard time getting a new job and that it only gets harder and harder. There is even research showing that applications with a 6-12 months unemployment period at the end mostly get ignored, whereas nearly identical applications from applicants who left their previous jobs recently do get responses. If you have been in your current job for more than a few months, not listing it is therefore simply not an option. 

I have worked for an organization working that way (not a company and not in North America). Most of the time, employees would arrange their travels themselves, pay with a credit card and get the money back afterwards. But it was also possible to submit a “claim” beforehand with an estimate of the costs. Once the travel was approved by my manager and the form had made its way through the administration, I would get an advance (up to x0% of the estimated cost) either as actual cash or as a bank transfer. Maybe something like that could be possible where you work? 

A single interview can be a little shorter or longer depending on how it goes but it does sound unprofessional to schedule a whole day if there was a real chance that you were a really bad fit. Except if you were completely unqualified and unable to answer any of their questions (which does not appear to be the case), there is no reason for them to be in a position to rule out a candidate invited for a whole day so quickly. If an employer is genuinely concerned about time wasted, the solution is to have a better screening process or perhaps a shorter first interview. At this point, the candidate's time is wasted anyway and invoking efficiency is just a rationalization. On top of that, it's unavoidable for such a decision to feel particularly unfair and demeaning to most people. It should be a concern, no matter how many times we try to tell ourselves that “you should not take it personally”. Besides, recruiters should be upfront about the process (e.g. when a decision will made). So not informing you that they would filter candidates along the way and then lying to you as they show you out seems unprofessional in itself. 

You will almost certainly have to switch jobs at some point in your career. So if you are concerned about the fact that your current employers “are real jerks to people that quit” it would seem better to quit earlier than not, while you can do it on your own terms, with a job lined up and less concern about having a reference from them. 

There are many potential reasons which have to do with getting around some legal obligations (which obviously vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so not all of these are going to be valid in any given place): 

In Europe (I have experience in Germany, France, the UK and the Netherlands), it's not uncommon to hear that other candidates were better suited (sometimes adding a few words about what was good about your profile or what the other candidates had that you didn't, e.g. specific experience with this or that). But it's always later in the process, when someone else has been hired or you have definitely been ruled out for the position for which you applied. In that case, your contact at the company might offer to keep your resume on file or invite you to apply for another position later on but I have never seen anyone suggest they might still call for this position if other candidates declined (if they might, they typically stall and take a few weeks before giving any specific feedback). For the rest, it's easier said than done but don't let that get to you. Whatever a prospective employer tells you, it should be expressed respectfully and courteously. I would consider someone telling me other candidates were “clearly better” in so many words to be rude so if that's what you were told, you have every right to feel angry about it. Still, if you need the job and there is an offer, take it. If you have something better and you don't feel good about it, then by any means decline. Also, do realize that the person you are talking to still knows very little about you and, possibly, even about the prospective job. They have to make a decision and might feel that other candidates are better for this particular position but it doesn't mean that you are bad at what you do. 

What type of positions are you applying to? In my experience, many systems do allow you to enter a degree you are going to obtain soon, especially for academic jobs where a PhD is a requirement. If the date is in the future or you add something like “expected” somewhere in the description, there is no ambiguity and no reason to be concerned about fraud. But in industry, it's very rare to see a position where people would be filtered out based on their holding a PhD or not. I have been to interviews and finally landed a job where it was an advantage but apart from academic jobs, the requirement is nearly always a master's degree and the PhD is at most a bonus (and quite often a liability: you have to show you are ready to work in industry and avoid projecting a mad scientist or pie-in-the-sky image). Of course, you would mention the PhD on your resume and should be very careful to use that and your cover letter to articulate how this experience is relevant to your future work. But you are unlikely to be automatically filtered out because you have not entered it in the online application system. In practice, a simple solution is therefore to mention your research experience as a “professional experience”. It is what it is, you spent 3-4 years working on a research project, not attending courses and you already have a master's degree (or Diplom) which is probably all that's needed in terms of formal academic qualification so what you need to look good on a casual glance is to beef up your professional experience, not another diploma. 

Such companies do exist but provide slightly different services than recruiters hired by a prospective employer. They don't keep job listings or match you with a specific position but provide training on how to update your resume or activate your network, interview coaching, help plan a career change or identify industries or companies that hire people with your profile, provide information on other resources available in your area, etc. Typically, their services would be paid for by the previous employer of the job-seeker, as part of the severance package. I suspect providing something like that might be a legal requirement in some European countries when closing a division/firing several people for economic/strategic reasons (as opposed to some fault of the employee). I based this answer on a specific example, from Switzerland, but I have no idea how common it is in general. 

From an ethical and practical point of view, it would seem that bringing it up with the people involved is the most obvious course of action. Presumably, even if you do put up cameras, advertising that fact should be more effective in preventing further incidents (beside potentially being legally required). You mentioned the fact that your friend does not want to involve security “for obvious reasons” but I don't quite follow what those might be. It would seem that preventing theft and vandalism is their responsibility. Even if some part of the security staff is in fact involved, bringing it up would give a serious warning to everybody and might prompt the guilty party to stop (isn't it precisely what you are trying to achieve?). Now, if your concern is that you don't trust the manager, security company or whoever is in charge of the security staff to deal with this properly or want to identify the culprits to sack them or press criminal charges then a camera is at best a small part of any solution. What you need is a lawyer or perhaps an audit of some sort that should help you find out the best ways to achieve that goal. 

I don't know Hungary (or your company, obviously) but it seems entirely possible that HR would not be particularly receptive to this complaint or that going to HR with any problem of this kind (as opposed to discussing it directly or accepting the group's consensus without “going over their head”) would in itself be perceived very negatively by your coworkers. You should probably ask yourself whether reporting it is likely to have any positive impact or if you are well placed to enact change in gender relations in this workplace. I would not only worry about being perceived as “prudish” (perhaps not the way you see yourself but not really all that bad) but as “the arrogant foreigner making trouble”. That's not necessarily a reason to swallow anything or stay quiet but that's a risk you should take into account. Personally, I have been living and working outside my country of origin for most of my life and I would not bring up such things myself out of the blue but certainly not stay quiet if they somehow became an issue or topic of discussion. I do the same outside of the workplace, incidentally. I feel it's a good way to respect the local culture and my place as an outsider while not condoning things I regard as unjust but I don't have any strong reason to suggest that this is the right course of action in general. 

I obviously cannot know if this is really the full explanation but references really are quite different in Germany so that your manager might not even quite understand what you are expecting of him. To give you an idea, in Germany, it's customary when leaving a job to receive a “certificate” (Zeugnis) detailing your duties and performance over the whole duration of your employment at that company. It uses a coded language so that something like zu unserer vollen Zufriedenheit (“to our complete satisfaction”) in the summary is actually pretty bad. A good certificate would say stets zu unserer vollsten Zufriedenheit (“constantly to our completest satisfaction”; “vollsten” sounds just as odd as “completest”). It gets worse: for example a word like “empathy” (“Einfühlungsvermögen”) is generally taken as implying sexual harassment or inappropriate behaviour toward female colleagues. Employees are entitled to a reference certificate and it must be broadly positive. There have been numerous court cases about this (one of them made the news in Germany this week). People really go to court over the little nuances I described above (in the last case, the court confirmed that employees are entitled to zu unserer vollen Zufriedenheit but the onus is on them to prove they deserve more, whereas employers must have specific serious grievances to write anything more critical). Traditionally, you would send all your certificates (along with your transcripts all the way back to secondary school) with each and every application, even before the first interview or phone screen (although more and more companies now accept or even invite what's called a “short application”, i.e. what you would think of as a regular job application). In a multinational company, I would expect some people to be aware of the differences but even in relatively young and dynamic companies in the IT industry, I have met recruiting managers who were genuinely surprised that people from other countries could not produce such certificates or would invite them to contact someone else as a reference. So it seems possible to me that your manager thought you expected him to write such a certificate and that he is unsure about how to express the right nuances in English or concerned about getting himself in hot waters if you were not happy about the result. Or maybe he does know how it works in Ireland and the UK but he is uncomfortable at the idea of being contacted by someone else as it is simply not done in Germany. 

I was in a similar situation a few years ago. It took me some time to land a stable job and I don't have any easy solution or very original advice but I can tell you a bit about what did work and did not work for me. Specifically, I don't think “setting your sights too high” is a problem or that seeking entry-level positions is a good strategy. It sounds like common sense and possibly dovetails with a stereotype (that of the arrogant academic expecting everything to come to them for free) but it just doesn't work in my experience. I applied for many of these jobs, was genuinely enthusiastic about some but if you are overqualified, employers will always be concerned about the fact you could be unsatisfied with the scope of the work, the compensation package, or be eager to run away at the first occasion, etc. That's an obstacle that's very difficult to overcome, no matter what you say or do. By contrast, I had more success in my applications with top-level employers (think Google, Microsoft…) and finally landed a great job in a R&D lab for a large European company. Having a PhD was explicitly listed as a plus on the offer and many of my colleagues came from a similar background. From there, I was in a perfect position to move to a more traditional career closer to the business and have a lot more opportunities now. So, whatever else you do, keep an eye open for this kind of positions and keep trying. Beyond that, the things you could do are pretty obvious: network as much as you can, don't make your resume too research-y (no list of publications!), emphasise any business-relevant experience you might have (internships?), keep applying to hone your interview skills (even if that can also be frustrating and depressing) and try to find something relevant to do in the meantime (privately-funded applied research at the university?) 

It's obviously worth less than actual experience in the field and will become less and less relevant with time but what's the downside? Anything that shows some special connection with the field and shows that you are genuinely interested in this particular job and not simply a run-of-the-mill generic software developer sending resumes out by the dozen is useful. It also shows that you put some effort into understanding the requirements of the job and tailoring your resume, which is good in itself.
