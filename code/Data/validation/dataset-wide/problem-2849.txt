The need for appeals is an aspect of authoritarianism. If stable authority is not an aspect of the group structure, there is no moral obligation to question any decision even once, much less revisit it. Contrary decisions can simply be made later with no element of correction to the original actor. Absent excessive scarcity, the wrong decision becomes a source of data, and making it both ways may simply be seen as scientific, rather than wasteful. From a point of view like Starhawk's in "Truth or Dare", authority is optional as a component of governance, and only truly productive in the presence of a level of genuine scarcity that has not existed for centuries, if ever. An artificial scarcity that is merely the effect of poor allocation is what sustains the apparent value of authority. (For example, we could feed everyone tomorrow, if we could coordinate it. But we are thwarted by tribalism and fear.) Absent the illusion that some minimal efficiency is mandatory because of scarcity, we are free to allow errors in our decision processes, and simply fix their consequences as they arise. If leaders are motivated to serve group goals, but the community maintains trust in adequate providence, the participants in power-struggles can play them out in a transparent way that can be judged experientially by those led. So moral systems that do not in themselves favor authority as a moral value would not impose any obligation to an appeals process. Moralities that go farther in favoring autonomy and challenge the value of authority itself would encourage clear and stable decisions with traceable consequences upon which the leaders can be judged. An appeals process simply dilutes responsibility for the consequences. Seeing the effects and being actively thwarted may motivate people to ignore unnecessary authoritarianism and displace authority from those who impose inappropriate conditions on the group. This then returns authority to its real value as 'power-with' by allowing it to ebb and flow according to the talent and reliability of its holder. 

Go to the definition. Fallacies are reasons behind invalid steps in a chain of deduction. If and only if there are deductions dependent upon a rule of deduction that have a model or a possible world where they are false, is the rule a fallacy. Not that this is particularly useful. But it is what you asked for. 

This really belongs somewhere like worldbuilding, not here. But I tend to just answer stuff knowing the result will be discarded... Mary Gentle has a similar species, who get a gender at the dawn of puberty. She actually points out that in a society that is still very labor-intensive and leans toward huge families as a consequence, it can be very inconvenient for someone to not have known whether they will get the added boost of muscle development and size, or whether they will be in charge of a household of their own children. She has characters who are very well-practiced in fighting, but never attain the height necessary to make it a profession because they become female. Or who grow up male and miss the time they used to spend with children because they are required to earn money for their own spouses, who are tied up at home with their children. So I think the answer has to depend upon the level of technology and how much that sorts the kinds of jobs people do by gender. In a modern world, where most people don't, for instance, carry things for a living or simply apply force to things for hours and hours a day in attempts to shape them to their will, where motherhood is not a permanent full-time job in its own right, because we don't have as many children as possible, and where even effectiveness in war and personal safety are equalized by technology, there would be no reason to care what gender you were growing into. 

There is no mind-independent reality and the rational will is not autonomous, they are locked in a feedback loop. Assuming the two things you have inappropriately insisted pragmatists believe bars an answer. Given that, your question comes down to 'Assuming the impossibility of stability without a foundation, how do we ignore that possibility completely.' 

No. Berkeley's legacy is not dead. All that we know we have are informational inputs. But we live in a different time, with a distinctly different physics. So Berkeley's perspective is a lot less compelling to us. Berkeley could look at the science of his day and find it consistent with his own mind. Can you really believe that you would evolve the nonsense we are discovering, if you were suspended in an information-only universe? I mean, most of it is all about everybody being wrong all the time. Then are you really, really crazy? Do you just like defeating yourself? Or do you have to believe there is input from something beyond mere information? If it is there, how reasonable is it to assume it is entirely illusory. If reasonable, it is still not productive. Curiosity leads us to want to know the illusion in complete detail, even if that is all we have. So, there is a point to positing the two different worlds, and their incomplete interaction, if only due to a lack of options. We cannot not be curious, and we cannot know anything but what gets through the veil of reality. 

To me, this is one of those places where early postmodernism is so materialist that it becomes a form of idealism. There is a fact of the matter, but it is a complex linguistic structure contained in the whole collection of interacting beings involved in 'the matter'. It is not a configuration of the things in the universe, or a collection of logical statements that are true by some discernible standard. It consists in all the moves related to the matter a player in a language game would consider valid as their next choice, the continuum of all the things that anyone might think or do next about the domain at hand that would be useful to the system of beings concerned with it in any way. 

From a Kantian idealist perspective, if something like determinism were true in a definitive way, we should be able to deduce it from logical laws. For a certain stripe of idealist, forms of intuition and categories are not physical facts, they are ideals, so something so completely defined in terms of two things, one a category (causation) and the other a form (time) should be equally ideal, and not affected by phenomenal wrapping. This is still a relatively respectable philosophical perspective, so I cannot see where we can agree it would be wrong to find such a deduction. What is more likely, from this point of view, is that such a construct is not relative or contingent, and therefore must be either provable or false. If we can prove by more concrete means that we cannot prove determinism, it indicates that determinism itself is false, and not just unattainably complex. This is important from an ethical point of view, because it determines whether duty is well-determined but relative due to our embedding in the world, or whether it is not well-determined, and might vary for different species. Basically, if duty is not well-determined, the agendas of different sorts of intelligence cannot be aligned or explained to one another, and we cannot "all just get along". The categorical imperative cannot really mean anything categorically. 

Your definition of 'unseen' needs elaboration. Do you mean undetectable by any physical test? Then people would never 'see' them. This does not correspond to the ordinary notion of ghosts, who are meant to affect our reality indirectly, if only by being occasionally noticed. Sure, the universe might be full of undetectable things, but science would not care, because such things cannot interact with us, and so nothing about them is testable. At some point, scientific theories need to be testable, or they will cease to have traction, and go away. 

Western philosophy contains at least a couple flavors of this basic idea, as one might expect, given the people involved, these take on mechanical metaphors. The most literal similar position that comes to mind is monism, and reflected by something like Leibniz 'Monadology' or Whiteheads "Process and Reality". The model Leibniz expressed was that every element of the world is a reflection of all the relationships it has to everything else. His image is that a soul is like a reflective sphere, which captures reflects the image of all the spheres around it, but other than that has no interior or content. It is the set of reflections and nothing else. Another closely related approach is the perspective of psychoanalysis, as captured by Jung, or by a group-dynamics perspective like that of Bion or the Tavistock movement. The basic model of thinking here is that whatever affects come to you are ultimately recorded either in your conscious or in your unconscious mind. The things that are unconscious are still part of you, and will affect your behavior without your conscious consent. But the effects that pass between people also happen on conscious and unconscious levels. So in some sense, the collection of emotional and other effects people have on one another are a shared pool, and not a set of segregated bundles belonging to individuals. Every group has a collection of shared material that is passed between them but for which no one in the group takes responsibility. This is the group's unconscious. Ultimately the parts of everyone's thoughts for which no one takes responsibility are part of a vast repository known as the Collective Unconscious. This perspective bears up the 'if you want to change your surroundings, you change yourself' morality. By deciding what you consciously attend to and resolve, and what you let have its own way with things, individuals channel the pool of thoughts passing between people in one way or another, and that controls their entire social environment which controls the vast majority of their physical environment.
