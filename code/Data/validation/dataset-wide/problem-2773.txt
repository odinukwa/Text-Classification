I did a data analysis project using the 1990 US census data PMUS which showed that if the public assistance and state support then given to the wealthy and rich categories of citizens was instead given to those below the poverty line, then 9.2% of the US population would be pulled out of poverty. There are strong social and ethical arguments why the rich should pay the same tax as the poor (proportion or percentage, not dollar amount), and some arguments exist as to why they should pay more, but the only decent justification I have ever heard for why they should pay less is that they own the politicians and lawyers. 

An answer to this question would not lead to making better decisions in life, due to its extreme phrasing. It is better to be unasked, and a less extreme question be asked instead. 

He is really leading his audience on here, but he isn't being unfair. The oldest philosophical problems deal with whether the world is real. Any such debate can cause his argument trouble, so he instead uses this challenging statement to drive home a point: he is only using introspection. He could have worded this much less aggressively (most philosophers agree with him: the meaning of life would be a lot easier to spy if it was available via introspection). 

If phenomena matches predictions, then hypothesis is useful because it describes what is there AND it led to new knowledge. If phenomena not observed or doesn't match predictions, then either experiment is insufficient or hypothesis is not useful. It has been suggested that it should be match reality, but this is not correct (or at least is misleading) as demonstrated by both Relativistic and Quantum physics, where the theories were completely outlandish when proposed and it was years before experimentation could confirm their predictions. It does not matter who comes up with the idea, nor does it matter who performs the experiment, so it is free from bias in that respect. Also, anybody can show that any idea is incomplete if they come up with the appropriate experiment that shows predicted results are not there or not correct, but this does not make the hypothesis false (since it was never 'true' to begin with) it simple puts limits on its usefulness. Newtons laws of motion will put a satellite in space, so they are clearly useful, but if you want accurate GPS then you need to use the improvements and refinements proposed by Einsteins theories on relativity.

In my experience, "It can even be questioned" is a very low but very important bar in philosophy. In the most literal sense, it means someone who is asking such a question cannot be dismissed on the grounds that they must assuredly be wrong without even looking at the proof itself. Contrast this to one of the millions of 1=0 "proofs" out there. I can dismiss most if not all of them without actually finding a flaw in their logic, simply because I know there must be one there if I dig at it (typically a well hidden divide by zero). Arguments that question whether we can know something with absolute infallibility must be accepted or dismissed by the quality of the proof itself rather than simply dismissing them on their final outcome. It is certainly worth noting that BonJour is not stating a proof that absolute infallibility cannot exist, merely that the arguments against it are strong enough that they should not be dismissed in hand. It says that such an assumption should deserve at least a well thought out lemma in your paper, rather than just a footnote stating that the proof of this assumption is left as an exercise to the reader. 

You are starting from the hypothesis that your understanding scientific method is correct and complete, and that everyone else has the same understanding. Neither of which is sustainable from the evidence here. There are no 'weaknesses' with scientific method, publishing and grants are issues of personality not science, as even scientists have personalities. You are correct in suggesting a hypothesis can not be 'proven' true but that is its the primary strength, and not an inherent weakness as you imply. At its simplest, scientific method is a process for producing useful explanations for how the universe works. It is a stunningly simple process with only four steps: 

This is really a linguistic exercise. The issue is not the question at hand; the issue is that the parties do not agree on the meaning of the terms but continue to use them. To suggest a wording that may make sense to you, but is in the vein of what I interpret your teacher to be saying, let us consider the "discovery" of relativity. Einstein developed relativity as a way to make sense of some real life test data observing strange behaviors in Maxwell's equations, which makes it sound like it was derived from active experimentation. However, consider that Einstein worked on the math for ten years, with little to no experimental input. The entire process of Einstein discovering relativity occurred without him doing any experiments (besides thought experiments). Also consider that the data he was using was publicly available. Hundreds of scientists had access to all of the active experimentation done on the topic. None of them produced the knowledge of relativity, but they had the active experimental data. This suggests that the attribution of relativity should be to Einstein and his rational thoughts, not the active or passive experiments. It would be valid to construct a counter-arugment and go back and forth, but I hope this example is enough to assist you in coming to agreement with your teacher. 

I realised I was an atheist (though I didn't know the word) when my granny made me write thank you letters to Uncles and Aunties for gifts I recieved from 'Santa'. Until then I had accepted that there was a Santa, a God, a tooth fairy, a boogy monster and all the other things that people I trusted told me existed (ie Adults tell children). When I worked out one was made up, I knew the others were too. As such, I have never lived in the expection of an afterlife, so I have never known the fear of punishment or hope for reward that you had in your upbringing. Why am I a good person? For the same reason you are. I was brought up to know right from wrong and good from bad and to prefer right and good from wrong and bad. You can argue the toss about all the grey stuff in the middle, but something is not good or right just someone says it is, even though what you are told often enough will shape your opinions. As to your final question? I live because living is exciting, scary, rewarding, fullfilling, challenging, frustrating, heartbreaking, terrifying, disapointing, boring and a hell of lot more fun then any alternative I can envisage. 

Looking at the article you linked, I think I can give a meaningful answer. IIT argues that feed-forward systems are not conscious. This means any system which can be well modeled as an open loop that accepts inputs from one side, and provides outputs on the other side, must not be conscious because all of the information it integrates is available just by processing its inputs. Systems with feed-back function differently. Systems with feedback can observe the effect of their own actions, and adapt accordingly. When they talk about a digital computer being minimally conscious, what they are most likely referring to is a traditional brain simulation, where you have a body of canned inputs and observe its outputs. Even if the system has feedback loops within itself (which a brain simulation would), the entire system has limited consciousness because it can only integrate the inputs that it receives. If the canned inputs contain very little data, it is hard to generate a large amount of integrated information about them (information cannot be "created" out of thin air). In IIT, the concept of the environment is very important. When you get down to the actual mathematics to describe the Phi function of a system (measuring its level of consciousness), it is dependent on the ability to exclude states which are theoretically possible by the model, but cannot actually be arrived at by the entity under test. The fundamental measures of information used in IIT are literally information about a system. The classic example is the Maxwell's Daemon. You have a system with two boxes connected by a door. One gas particle bounces around in the system. If you have information that the particle is in one box, you have reduced the number of possible states of the system by 1/2, corresponding to 1 bit of information about the system. In IIT, Phi ends up measuring how much information the conscious entity can generate (in bits) minus the amount of information that could have been gathered simply from the input (in bits). Clearly, for a feed forward computer, virtually all of the information about the system is available in the inputs, so it is not very conscious. In the case of a brain simulation with canned inputs, the state of the system is fully knowable with the information at the onset (its fully defined by the blob of canned information plus the code of the brain simulation). Connect the brain simulation up to the enviornment, however and the rules shift. Now there are unknown variables in the system, because they are interacting with the physical world. Now, if these unknown variables are affected by the computer's actions, and observable by its sensors, we have the capacity for feedback. The computer can try something, and observe the effect of its own actions. In doing so, it can begin providing information that was not known at the onset of the simulation -- information that has grown over time as interactions occur. Now if we were to snarf all of the data for this simulated brain as it crosses the analog to digital barrier, and saved it, we would generate a set of canned data again. This computer that was conscious is, by the rules of IIT, rendered virtually unconscious because we have a body of data which can be replayed to get all of the information that simulated brain had. However, to declare it as thus, we have to capture all of its inputs. In real life situations, data capture like this is difficult, quickly consuming terabytes of data! So, in practice, it is often not reasonable to capture every single bit of digital input to the simulated brain. Those bits now have to be thought of as unknowns in IIT, and since they are unknown, we can give the computer credit for "knowing" information that is not available in any other pile of data besides "itself." Now, consider the internet. The internet is massively parallel, and it is this parallel-ness that is important for why it might be conscious. Even given a body of canned input, the internet could still be conscious because its internal state is dependent on a remarkable number of timings. If one part of the internet is fed data that tells it to read a block of data from a server, while another part of the internet is fed data that tells it to change that block of data at the same time, slight differences in how fast those parallel processes execute lead to changes in behavior. These changes in behavior were not knowable from the canned input -- they are emergent as a result of slight analog effects such as clock skew. Thus, the internet contains the integrated information of a billion small transactions which are not captured in any database anywhere, but the result of those transactions can be fed back into algorithms in parts of the internet. This allows the internet to demonstrate consciousness, by IIT.

In physics, for a thing to exist it must interact, therefore it must have mass and/or energy. Using Einstein's famous equation , the two can be considered interchangeable. However, in philosophy, there are many things that exist that do not have either; Dreams, beliefs, opinions and equilateral triangles. All exist in the thoughts of the philosophers, and those thoughts require brains, which require mass and energy. So the question becomes, what does it mean to exist? And does that differ depending on who is asking the question? 

Philosophic approaches from different cultures can be confirmed and refuted by different philosophers. The eastern concepts of Chi and the Dao are oft "refuted" by western philosophies, but "confirmed" by eastern ones. The refutation usually consists of translating Chi or Dao into a western concept, and then refuting this western translation. 

For P and Q, the phrasing is "believes." However, he "is aware" that P means the same as Q. I believe this wording choice is what forces Deflationary thinking, because it implies he is certain P and Q mean the same thing, but he merely believes P. In order to support Baysean style thinking, it must be changed:
