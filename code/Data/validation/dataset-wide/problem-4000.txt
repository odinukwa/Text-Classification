Written about mathematicians, by mathematicians, and certainly for mathematicians, the self-published "choose your own adventure," Mathematics Odyssey, certainly deserves mention. 

"The Geometry of Moduli Spaces of Sheaves" by Huybrechts and Lehn. Thankfully, it seems that an updated edition is in the works. 

Motivation: I am trying to prove a certain class of sheaves forms a bounded family (namely, the collection of sheaves underlying stable pairs). The above result will allow me to reduce to the case where the support is a fixed CM curve, and from there, I know how to finish the proof. I am aware that Le Potier (who built the moduli space of stable pairs, among others things, in "System Coherents et Structures de Niveau" --- pardon my lack of accents) has proven a much stronger result. However, for my purposes, it would be very helpful to have a proof (hopefully much less technically demanding than Le Potier's) that is no more general than what I need. EDIT: in hindsight, and in light of the negative answer below, I realize that Le Potier does not claim to prove quite what I claimed he claimed. 

EDIT: as pointed-out below, this has been posted on math.stackexchange. I'll leave it up to the community whether or not to delete this question, but I do think there is room for a more technical answer than the one posted on math.stackexchange. 

"Without loss of generality" is a standard in the mathematical lexicon, and I am writing to ask if anyone knows where the expression was popularized. (The idea has been around since antiquity, I'm sure, but the expression itself might not be that old.) 

If $p_i$ are all bounded away from $0$ and $1$ independently of $i$ and $n$ then, of course, the maximum is at most $C/\sqrt{n}$, where $C$ depends on how far the $p_i$'s are from $0$. Are there bounds that are good when the $p_i$'s are non homogeneous? Like, say, $p_i=1/i$ or even $p_i=c/n$? Are there any precise results known? Then is, can one in general obtain the exact result in some key situations? Say $p_i=1/2$? 

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a finite graph and let $f$ be any positive function defined on the vertices. Put weights on the vertices $v_{i}$, way $w_{i}$ so that $\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\leq 1$. Assume that every independent set of vertices, say $I$, satisfies $\sum_{v_i\in I}w_{i}\leq 1/2$. I would like to maximize over all choices of the weights the following expression (the average of f):$\\$ $$\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(v_i)w_{i}.\\$$ Question: is it true, that at least one global maximum is achieved by either i) putting weights $1/2$ on a pair of two neighboring vertices or ii) putting a weight $1/2$ on one vertex and $0$ on all of the others? Remark: the second situation can arise, for example, in the case $G$ is the empty graph and the value of $f$ at one vertex is strictly larger than on the other vertices. 

Consider $m$ unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with positive coordinates so that $m>n$. How does one pick the $m$ unit vectors so that the largest inner product of them is the smallest? 

Let $P$ be a finite poset. Assign the following diagram to it - put the maximal element of $P$ on the first level, the maximal of the rest to the second level, etc. Assume that the diagram is connected, that is, that between each pair of elements in the diagram we have a chain connecting them. Let $L_n=P\times P\times\cdots\times P$ ($n$-times) to be the product poset, that is, one element in $L_n$ is larger than another if we have all inequalities coordinate-wise. Is it true that there exists and $N=N(P)$ such that for $n>N$ the following is true: In the diagram of L_n there is a perfect matching between all consecutive levels (from the one with smaller size to the one with larger size). Note: due to the useful feedback of Andres Caicedo and David Speyer the question was altered. 

Let $\pi: V\to W$ be a resolution of singularities, let $E \subset V$ be the exceptional divisor, and let $F$ be a coherent sheaf such that $R^i\pi_*F=0$ for $i>0$. 

Another interpretation of "well-behaved" might be that the collection of semistable sheaves with a fixed Hilbert polynomial is a bounded family of sheaves. This is equivalent to saying that there is a coherent sheaf F with the property that all semistable sheaves with fixed Hilbert polynomial P can all be realized as a quotient of F. See 1.7 of Huybrechts and Lehn. Compare with the Hilbert scheme: there, we only need to fix the Hilbert polynomial, but that is because all structure sheaves of subschemes come equipped with the structure of a quotient of OX. So boundedness of the family of structure sheaves is equivalent to fixing the Hilbert polynomial. 

In section III.3.4 of Eisenbud & Harris's "The Geometry of Schemes," we/they construct an infinite family of double structures on $\mathbb{P}^1 \subset \mathbb{P}^3$ that are distinguished from each other by their genus. Here is the construction (let's just worry about $\mathbb{C}$ for now): Let $d$ be a non-negative integer, and let $S = \mathbb{C}[u,v,x,y]/(x^2, xy, y^2, u^dx - v^dy)$. Then $X_d = Proj$ $S$ is a double line with arithmetic genus $-d$. Eisenbud and Harris then go on to say that "every projective double line of genus $-d$, with $d \geq 0$, is isomorphic to $X_d$." My question is: where can I find a proof of this statement? More generally: if you fix a curve $C$ of genus $g$, how can I describe the moduli of genus $d$ double curves lying over top of $C$? 

Let $A\subset \mathbb{R^2}$ be a finite set such that $|A|=k^2$. Let $x_i\in \mathbb{R^2}$, $i=1,2,3,4$, be four points in the plane in general position (no three lie on any line). Let us form the multiset of cardinality $4k^2$ out of the four translates $A+x_i$ and call it $M$. Question: Can we partition $M$ into four sets (not multisets) $A_i$, $i=1,2,3,4$ with cardinalities $(k+1)^2$, $(k-1)(k+3)$, $(k-1)^2$, $(k-1)^2$, respectively? Question: Are there any good references for problems of this kind? 

Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be independent random variables in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $EX_i=0$ and $||X_i||_{2}\leq 1$. What is the best known exponential upper bound for $$P(||X_1+\cdots+X_n||_{2}>x)?$$ In particular, is it true, that the one dimensional case (Hoeffding's inequality) is the best? That is, is the latter probability at most $C_d\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2n})$? (the conctand $C=C_d$ is needed to account for the effects of the norm for $x$ small, that is, for $x<\sqrt{d}$ we can take all variables taking values $e_i$ and $-e_i$ with probability $1/2$, where $e_i$ stand for the usual basis of $\mathbb{R}^d$. 

Let $Z_1,\ldots, Z_n$ be independent standard gaussian random variables. Is it true that $X=\max\{Z_1,\ldots,Z_n\}$ has a log-concave distribution function? 

Let $A$ be a set of $2k$ points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that no open set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ of diameter $2$ contains more than $k$ of these points. What is the largest possible distance $r_n>0$ one can guarantee so that for all $k$ we can pair up $2k$ points under the mentioned condition so that each pair of points is at least $r_n$ apart? It is not difficult to show that $1\leq r_n \leq 2$ ($2$ comes from just taking $|A|=2$ and proving that one can always have them at distance $1$, one can build a distance graph so that two point from $A$ are joined if they are at least $1$ apart - such graph has minimum degree at least $k$ and so has a Hamilton cycle). 

The idea being to somehow use that$-E$ is nef on $E$. EDIT: the exceptional fibres of $\pi$ are one-dimensional and $R^{\bullet} \pi_*O_V = O_W$ EDIT 2: we may assume that the support of $F$ is one-dimensional 

This was answered in the negative by Max Dehn, who showed that it was impossible to cut a cube into a finite number of polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled into a tetrahedron. This was accomplished by associating to each polyhedra $P$, an element $D(P)$ of the group $\mathbb{R}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}(\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Q}\pi)$ that is invariant under cutting and pasteing. To obtain his result, Dehn then proved that the cube had value 0 in the group above, and the tetrahedron had a non-zero value. My question is this: is there a more conceptual explanation for why this question should be answered in the negative? In particular, the corresponding statement about polygons is true: given two polygons with the same area, there is a decomposition of the first polygon into polygonal pieces that may be reassembled into the second (see the Wallace-Bolya-Gerwien Theorem). Is there a specific property of polygons that we are exploiting to prove WBG, that fails when we go to three dimensions? 

Proposition 2.3.1 of "The Geometry of the Moduli Space of Sheaves" by Huybrechts and Lehn provides a proof of what you are looking for. 

I think the second construction is not correct. If you replace the cover with the category whose objects are all intersections of elements of your original cover, then the two notions agree. 

The question is in the title. I am trying to apply the Mitchell (Freyd-Mitchell?) embedding theorem, which states that for every small abelian category $A$, there exists a ring $R$ such that A embeds into the category $R$-mod. The derived category is not abelian, of course, but I have a particular subcategory that is abelian, and life would be easiest if the derived category was smal, so that the subcategory was small and abelian.
