The big problem which George has overlooked is the amateur astronomy community. The first thing that will happen when the news is released is that hundreds of (in some cases quite decent) telescopes will point at the reported coordinates and see --- nothing. There are thousands of these folks, and they talk to each other. The word would spread pretty quickly that there's a problem. How decent is decent? Well, this company will sell you a 25 inch Dobsonian for 15k. Compare this to the Mt Palomar 200 inch, and it's only a factor of 64 worse. Now, it's true that most amateurs don't have the advantage of really good cooled CCDs for long-term exposures, but some of them do. The pro's also have locations which offer good seeing conditions (like mountain tops) but that actually won't help all that much. The point of amateur detection, after all, is not precision imaging, but rather detection. EDIT - I see that my point has been missed. By providing a link to a 25-inch telescope, I did not intend to provide a limit on amateur efforts. A quick Google on "largest amateur telescope" provided a link to a 50-inch monster which any fanatic can buy, and also to someone who showed a bit of ingenuity and recycled a damaged 70 inch mirror. While this is touted as the largest in the world, it may or may not be the king. Assuming 70 inches is the maximum, you need to realize that George's story has to be credible in the discovery mechanism. For comet/asteroid detection, which would be the most likely source of discovery, a wide FOV survey of the sky is performed, followed by another some time later. Comparison of the two images reveals which objects are moving with respect to the celestial background. A typical effort (and there aren't many) is Spacewatch and you'll note that the largest telescope they use is 1.8 meters, which translates to (surprise) 71 inches. A more powerful scope might then perform the observations which produced the orbital parameters, but it's clear that amateur scopes could detect such an object. This is particularly true since survey images tend to be taken with relatively short exposures in order to permit mapping the entire sky (wide FOV is a relative term), while confirmation observations by amateurs could well utilize longer exposures. All else being equal, a 70 inch/1 hour exposure is the same as a 50 inch/2 hour exposure. So I really don't see that George is going to get away with it. 

The answer to this is the Roche Limit. Closer than this and gravitational forces will rip it apart. The Roche Limit is about 2 1/2 times the radius of the central body. Just to make things easy, figure 3 times the radius of the earth to the center of the moon, or about 12,000 miles. Since the current average distance to the moon is about 240,000 miles, this is 1/20 the current value. When the moon is directly overhead, the distance will be 2 radii, or 8,000 miles. Since the moon's radius is 0.237 earth, or 938 miles, the apparent size of the moon, in degrees, is $$\theta = 2 tan^{-1}(\frac{948}{2\times 3960}) = 13.7 degrees$$ Comparing this to the current size, about 0.23 degrees, the close moon will be about 60 times bigger (apparent diameter, not area) than is true now. Something else to consider is that, as the distance to the moon changes, the orbital period changes, too, and the change goes as (Kepler's Third Law)$$T^2 = K\times R^3$$ Reducing the radius by a factor of 20 will reduce the length of a month by a factor of 90. So the moon will orbit the earth about every 7 1/2 hours. 

Using light to launch an interstellar probe has a number of things going for it, but it's not all peaches and cream. Most importantly. it's wildly inefficient in the short term. For a light beam bouncing off a mirror, the thrust applied to the mirror amounts to 150 MW of optical power per newton of force. Note that a newton isn't much. For the video's proposed 70 GW array, that amounts to about 467 N, or about 100 pounds of force. Of course, the advantage is that the thrust just doesn't stop. The linked video talked about sending a package to Mars in 8 hours, and this is correct. What you may not have realized is that the package under discussion is a CubeSat, and these things have a maximum mass of 1.33 kg. For such a light object, the acceleration is about 35 g's so yes, it really does get moving. Also note that nothing is said about how to slow it down once it reaches target. This is not, in principle, difficult: you just have another 70 GW array orbiting Mars which applies deceleration. It is unfair to ask how the target array got there in the first place. So, there are (at least) 2 things to ask about an interstellar launcher. How big is the laser array, and how big is the probe? Let's say, just as a starting point, that the probe has a 1 $km^2$ light sail, and weighs 1000 kg. This is clearly not a manned probe, and the technology is beyond what we can do (if nothing else, we can't guarantee reliable operation for a century or more, and that assumes average velocities of about 0.3 c - more on that later). Let's say that the laser arrays are the video's 70 GW. As the video points out, solar power makes the most sense, especially for long-duration power production. Conceptually, each array consists of a 10 km x 10 km solar cell array which will orbit oriented to point directly at the sum. The back side of the platform is a phased-array of laser emitters producing a total of 70 GW, with a beam steering capability of +/- 60 degrees. This limits the illumination time for an object to about 1/3 of the array's orbit. Fortunately, you specified that 3 launchers will be built, so if the 3 arrays are in solar orbit at 120 degrees spacing, one will always be available for use. An obvious requirement in this case is that the array orbit must be inside earth's orbit, since the arrays can only fire outward from the sun. With a probe mass of 1000 kg, acceleration will be nominally about 0.467 m/$sec^2$. How long will the array be able to supply power? Assuming a 1 um laser wavelength, the diffraction angle for the beam is the Rayleigh criterion $$\theta = 2.44\frac{\lambda}{D} = \frac{2.44 \times 10^{-6}}{10^4} = 2.44\times10^{-10}\text{ radians}$$ and this will produce a spot size of 1 km at $$ R = \frac{d}{2 \theta} = \frac{1000}{2\times 2.44\times 10^{-10}}= 2\times10^9\text{ meters}$$ or about 7 light-seconds. After this range, the thrust will drop off as the square of the range, since the beam will get larger and large and the mirror will intercept a progressively smaller portion of. The high-boost phase will take$$ t = \sqrt{\frac{2s}{a}}= \sqrt{\frac{4\times10^9}{.467}}=857,000\text{ sec}$$, or about 10 days and velocity at that point will be $$ v = at = .467\times 8.57\times10^5 = 4\times10^5\text{ m/sec}$$ I am, frankly, too lazy to do the math for the post-peak acceleration, but let's round up the final velocity to about $10^6$ m/sec. Note that this is only about 0.3% of c, and time to 61 Viginus is about 8600 years. It's clear that we need bigger guns. Now, as promised, the question of how to slow down at journey's end. It's very, very clear from the previous that there is no way affect the final trajectory with the specified array. It simply will not produce an appreciable power density over 30 light years. But let's say that we could, somehow, do this. Does that help? The answer is yes. During the voyage the probe turns around and ejects a second, much larger mirror which precedes the probe. The braking beam impinges mostly on the secondary mirror, accelerating it, but the reflected beam hits the probe mirror and provides a braking force. This is not exactly a friendly move towards the target system, since it produces an expended secondary mirror which whips through the target system at (for a secondary mirror equal in mass to the payload probe) about twice the transit velocity. Admittedly, the braking mirror is presumably some extremely lightweight material, but still... Assuming a launch acceleration adequate to produce low-relativistic velocities, launch window is fairly forgiving, about 4 months/year. The immediate issue is to eliminate the cross-target velocity of the probe. Doing this immediately will, of course, result in a small radial velocity for any probe launched with a velocity near Earth's escape velocity, since the orbital velocity of the earth is about 30 m/sec. The ideal launch point occurs when the sun/earth vector is about 45 degrees to the target vector. Then the cross-target velocity is relatively small, and angling the mirror to eliminate this will also produce decent down-range acceleration. The exact optimum and window will depend on the thrust available and the launch velocity of the probe from earth. In principle, there is nothing to prevent using the laser beam to provide all of the thrust and the probe assembled in low earth orbit, but the numbers need to be worked out. EDIT - Oh yes, and about the gravitational lensing thing. You can probably forget it. I haven't been able to get at the underlying calculations, but it seems pretty clear that the author simply doesn't know what he's talking about. A discussion of this is beyond the scope of this question, but I'm fairly certain that it won't work. His claims and explanations are to some degree self-contradictory, and he seems to have overlooked a few very important issues. I could be wrong (as history has shown) but I'm fairly sure I'm not in this case.
