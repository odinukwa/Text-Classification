I think you are in a good position but you may have slightly the wrong mindset. You are not an employee and as such you don't have job security in the same way you would have (or not have) if you were employed. You are a contractor who has a good relationship with a client. You can and even should ask them about what work is in the pipeline. A good relationship goes both ways so they will want to keep you on if they can. However, this is not always possible as often external resources, like yourself, are not financially viable in the longer term. What you can do is be proactive about the situation: 

There is another possibility: That while the team were happy hiring you their decision was overruled. Often hiring decisions stay within the local team before getting a final sign off from higher up. It does seem to fit the evidence. It was not just yourself that spent a lot of time, the company did as well. They would not do this if they were not seriously interested. It sounds like it was the final authorisation that caused the issue. I've seen it from the other side, where I have interviewed a good candidate for a role where there was supposed to be a job and to be told that it was not possible to hire them. It is unlikely that the company would let on if this was the case, to say 'we have no budget', or 'we have a hiring freeze' or 'the sales team blew the budget on their team building trip to Venice' is not something they would say to somebody in your position. While it is disappointing it does happen. 

AndreiROM's answer is excellent but I wanted to add one thing. You need to log incidents. Specific dates and items. You also need to talk to your co-workers and get the same information from them. If you go to management and say "a couple of pairs of headphones went missing" there is not much they can do. If you go in and say "there's a pattern of stuff going missing. 

Now there is specific information they can act on, a pattern of wrongdoing, and they can start looking to see what people those dates have in common and the fact that there is a pattern of items going missing over a period of time means they can be sure it's not just one forgetful employee misplacing something. 

The other answers are exactly correct. You need to escalate this immediately. However - before you do so: Write down clearly exactly what the situation is. Flights booked for X, training booked for Y. Write down what you have already tried (contacted training company etc). Write down any ideas you have to try and mitigate this (is the training company even available on the correct dates? Can you find alternative training?). Note down the fact that the training people clearly only made a feeble effort to get in touch - a simple google should have found them a contact number for your company for example. That could be useful in negotiations for a rescheduling. Then go to your boss and tell him what has happened, referring to your notes as needed. Explain what you've already tried, and any ideas you have. Show that you are trying to fix this. Having the notes written down ahead of time will give you something to refer to if you get flustered during the meeting. I'll be honest. You may get fired. However I guarantee you that if you even try and cover this up or delay in reporting it then you will get fired. I'm not a lawyer but it's unlikely the company could or would sue you for an honest mistake made while performing your duties. Especially since it is unlikely they would ever get back as much cash from you as it would cost to sue! Trying to hide this though could easily lead you open to accusations of or actual fraud which have not just civil but criminal penalties involved! 

Precariously balance a very expensive looking (but in reality cheap) vase or some other ornament on the corner of your desk. It is important that it looks: 

It sounds like you are in a horrible situation, and you should never have to do such things. You sound like you are quite deliberately non-managerial. if you don't have a chance to move this may make it a bit easier for you. It is also worth you trying to find someone higher up the chain to talk to, even if you have never seen them in person. Your manager's behavior is not just hurting you and the team you are in but the company itself. If products don't get shipped profits drop and shareholders get unhappy. Thinking about it in a general rather than a personal nature may help you to make the step, you are not just helping yourself but the whole company. 

Yea, the 'international and local wages and my relative position' sounds like a line they feed you to try and justify. I would believe it. It is possible that the company is struggling and can't afford to pay more. If their costs are being squeezed they may not have scope to pay more. A company would not want to tell their employees this directly so they may use the 'international average' as a way to fob you off. It is also possible they are being tight. They are trying to get away with paying you as little as possible. The can then go into profits or even bonuses for the line managers. If you are unable to leave and they will not negotiate the only other thing you can do is ask for a promotion. If you have several years of glowing reports this would seem possible. Perhaps it is time to take on more responsibility and get more wage for doing so. You don't specifically exclude this as an option so it is worth mentioning. 

Really it depends on what you are asking for and why. If you went to your company and said that you wanted to take an extra 2 months unpaid leave every year they would probably not be too happy. On the other hand if you said to them that you wanted to take 3 months unpaid leave as a once off to travel the world they are likely to be more agreeable. There's no guarantee, but if you can organize things to the company so you take time out during a quiet period then a surprising number of companies will agree to it. After all the experience and motivation that you gain during that time will add value to the company when you return. I was recently offered a contract where they wanted me to fill in for someone because he was taking 6 months out to go volunteer for a charity in Africa. In that case the company weren't just allowing the unpaid leave but willing to pay contractor rates to get someone in to replace him for that time! 

One thing to remember is that companies generally like to think that their employees will be responsible. If you turn around to a company and say for example "I'd love to start immediately as I'm really keen to begin here, but I'm right in the middle of a project at my current company and could use 6 weeks to finish that so I don't leave them in the lurch". Then you are showing that you like to finish things, that you take pride in the results of your work, and that hopefully they can expect you not to abandon them if or when the time comes for you to move on once more. Those are all positive attributes of an employee, not negative ones. 

As a non native english speaker, yes, please do. Its not rude, and he probably doesn't know he is making mistakes. If you are so inclined, please take the time to correct him. The vast majority of people will really appreciate that. 

That depends. Do you think your supervisor will actually lend credence to your report, or do you have specific proof? If so, you should definitely say something in your exit interview, or if there isn't one maybe in a private chat with your supervisor on your last day. It also depends if you like the company and/or your supervisor enough to want to tell them, but yes, generally you should mention it, at least somewhere, but only if you're absolutely sure they were lying and you can point to some facts to support that. You don't want to make accusations that don't go anywhere, as that could jeopardize future references. If I was the supervisor I would definitely want to know about it. 

I strongly recommend against doing this. First of all, since you didn't do this before and started doing this after your lunch was stolen (which was brought up with management), there is probable cause to believe you did this as response to the theft. That is illegal. You are not allowed to intentionally poison someone for stealing from you (in every jurisdiction I know of). Responding to a crime by committing your own crime (you even admit you would do it because of the thefts) is not a solution. You have a very decent chance of being liable for the health damage that person takes. It doesn't really matter what kind of medication this is, intentionally making someone take medication they don't want to is morally deplorable and actually illegal almost everywhere. So most likely, the result will be at least an instant dismissal for cause, if you hit the fan harder criminal charges and civil liability for damages incurred. If, for some reason, you still want to do this I strongly recommend consulting a lawyer and your doctor first to make absolutely sure that you won't get completly destroyed by the consequences.
