Highly customizable to allow for a very high end (and expensive) shaft that is both light and strong Carbon fibre is stiff and walking poles made of it have no vibrations and offer a very solid feel in the hand when in use 

To answer the question simply - no, you shouldn't spray it with anything. Waterproof fabrics (the higher end kind) are coated in the factory with a DWR (Durable Water Repellent) finish that is usually silicone based. DWR will wear out over time (and then you spray again), but straight off, it is good to go for many days of wear and use. Just wash it regularly (I do after 5-10 days of actual use) on a gentle cycle with a non-bio detergent (or use a designated soap from the likes of Nikwax, Granger's Storm or even just pure soap flakes). At some point the water will stop beading, mainly at high wear areas such as the waist or shoulders, and than a spray of those areas after a wash will do the trick. 

I had the privilege on introducing the outdoors to quite a few people in my life, lately focusing on my wife and child; and from my experience there are a few simple things that increase the chance they might enjoy it: 

To give a simple question, yes, you can, but it is very complicated. About 10 years ago I've done a similar journey but I found that walking around Lima and west and south of the Andes very hard so I ended up using public transportation. Walking in the Andes is very challenging as weather conditions are rapidly changing and you will have cold temperatures every night, even in summer. Elevation is a nightmare for backpacking and I have yet to find any descent maps for the area. The best solution I found for route finding, resupply etc is to ask anyone I met on the way (locals) about those things. Pick a place that you aim for and have some 1:100k maps for general route setting (unless you find good topo maps) and plot+sketch anything you can based on those recommendations. The less you will be planning and the more you will be self sufficient and solo reliable with good and variable gear the easier it will be. 

Keep them comfortable - make sure they have as little physical discomfort as possible as that makes an immediate excuse for not enjoying. Make sure they have the right clothes for the weather, that you carry enough food, water and treats and that your breaks are in a comfortable setting to sit and enjoy. Make the walk short but with a very clear goal: climb a peak, reach a waterfall, etc. Another part of it is to try and find a circular trail so they don't feel they are "going back". Pack a handful of things they don't expect: maybe a few cold beers for when you reach your mid walk goal, an excellent coffee kit for some really nice coffee with fresh pastries and so on. If possible on the trail, find a perceived dangerous point that will give them something to talk about later on and will become their "type 2 fun" to think back on. This can be walking on a small exposed ledge, crossing a river etc. Just make sure you can keep all of you safe there. 

For non FKT (Fastest Known Time) chasers fastpacking is aimed at keeping a 3-5 miles per hour pace with the goal of covering 25-40 miles per day. I found that fastpacking can be very demanding and settled on ultrapacking (my term...) that is more about slow endurance than speed, aiming for 2.5-3.5 mph over 10-12 hours with no breaks, using similar methods to ultrarunning. With ultrapacking I can usually cover 25-35 miles per day depending on conditions. Both methods require light gear, great endurance and the right mindset. The biggest problem is not doing a day hike in fastpacking conditions but actually getting up and doing so over and over again so I focus on recovery in my training. A good way to teach your body to recover well is increasing daily run distances without overdoing each run. The idea is to run a comfortable pre-injury distance (before muscles begin to break from anaerobic training), lets say 3 miles, over 6 days straight. The following week increasing the distance slightly (half or a quarter mile) per day, teaching the body to recover well without reaching a limiting injury. Good sleep habits outdoors are also vital for good recovery and the lack of them is a leading reason that people give up on long distance fast packing. 

The trick is to think about all the things that you are happy to grind your teeth and ignore in the outdoors as part of the bigger picture while hiking and eliminate them as potential problems. Good luck in getting them to join. If you do succeed the feeling is great! 

Carbon walking poles tend to be more highly designed compared to aluminium walking poles and will offer lighter features to support the materials lightweight feature. How to choose No answer here, sorry. Good carbon fibre poles are amazing but poorly made carbon fibre poles will just break too easily. Well made aluminium poles that are really featured with lightweight finishes are amazing too but tend to climb to the carbon fibre price point. 

That will be my half hearten addition to the pros and cons. At the end of the day, it is what you feel like - I like hiking and camping alone, my wife doesn't. Simple. 

Dinner This is where the recovery really come into play. My meal was a high energy freeze dried meal from Expedition Foods - gluten free, providing 800 calories per meal, 6 different flavours. For desert I made a hot chocolate drink using the SiS protein night release powder. The idea is to boost the recovery over night to allow better performance the day after. They recommend 3 scoops (42g) powder with 300ml of cold water, but I found that dissolving the 3 scoops with a 1/4 cup of cold water and adding boiling water after dissolved gave a nice, lightly sweetened desert drink. Extras I also had 2 coffees a day, one with breakfast (around 7:00) and one at my mid day break (around 13:00). When I reached villages/towns I picked some cake and coffee as a booster to be consumed on the spot. Nutrition This menu provided me with roughly 3400 calories per day out of 700g of food to carry per day. This translated to 8.5kg of food to carry for 11 days, plus and extra day. All the food is gluten free (I'm intolerant) and provided around 147g (20%of total weight) of protein per day. Though it wasn't the most varied menu, it provided a good mix of textures and flavours that I wasn't sick of it by the end. Non of the meals required any cooking, only to add hot water and a little wait. i will note that I was in a mild environment (5-10 deg c) and for colder environment I'll add another 1000 calories - half in breakfast and half at dinner using extra meals. If you would like to read more about my menu choices for that trip, have a look here. 

Aluminium is a metal that can bend and still retain some structural integrity though it is still more susceptible to break once it is bent Aluminium is a relatively cheap material, especially compared to carbon, and so aluminium walking poles are much cheaper 

When comparing shafts made in the same thickness with the same level of finish and quality of production, carbon will be lighter and stronger compared to aluminium. That said, it is rarely the case and it depends on the company making the poles and the quality of product. The case for aluminium Aluminium is a metal that, when used for walking poles, is casted into shafts that are then glued with a welding agent to form the parts of the poles (in most cases). This results in a very strong bond and shaft that has a high tolerance for lateral pressure. Aluminium needs to be relatively thick in order to produce a structurally sound shaft and it is the reason those poles are slightly heavier than a comparable carbon pole with the exact features. Aluminium's two most useful features are: 

The most common aluminium types offered in the market for walking poles are 7075 and 6061, with the 7075 is much less brittle and lighter than 6061. The case for Carbon Fibre Carbon fibre is a composite which means it is artificially made using carbon fibre grid sheets and resin making it a very variable material that really depends on the quality of manufacturing and handling. As a composite is can be as thin or as thick as preferred and can be made with a variety of resins. The right resin in the hands of a good manufacturer can result in a very strong, thin walled shaft that will make extremely lightweight and robust walking poles. In the wrong hands carbon fibre is brittle, fragile to lateral forces and cutting and is quit heavy. Carbon's two most useful features: 

For sustaining a person long term in extreme conditions such as walking daily 15-25 miles in varying conditions, the biggest problem after having enough energy to walk is the ability to properly recover every night to do that again and again. To be able to recover well you need a good amount of protein every day, especially during the night, to get good muscle recovery and reducing fatigue. I just finished walking 250 miles over 11 days (roughly 23.5 miles a day), fully self sustained without too much weight loss or any muscle injuries. My menu consisted of: Breakfast - self made mix of 1/4 cup semolina, 1/4 cup chia seeds, 1/4 cup of chopped nuts, 1/4 of dried fruit, 1 tsp of sugar and a pinch of salt. The trick is to use different nuts and fruit for each breakfast for the variety. This breakfast is packed in slow release carbs, protein and fats. Day food Here it is a combination of trail mix, protein bars and dried meat. In a single day I ate: 

I suffered from chaffing for years and tried a whole range of options. What I found that worked best is the Under Armour Original Boxer Jocks, the 9" version. They cover most of the thigh and holds well enough to keep everything separated to avoid the chaffing. I get them from USA when they go on sale, but Wiggle, SportShoes and others stock them. If a chaffing does start, keep a few wipes and some Fenistil Gel in hand to clean and treat the area. Chaffing happens when the skin is moist, irritated and has bacteria starting to grow. Wiping the area with the wipes and killing any bacteria with the Fenistil will make sure it won't get inflamed. This combo of methods works for me for 24 hours speed hikes, multi days hikes (20-30 miles a day, 3+ days) and long trail runs. Good luck with the Welsh 15. 

Aluminium poles tend to be heavier due to thicker shafts and design that is less lightweight focused, companies just assume that aluminium poles are "entry level" products Aluminium vibrates due to the simple fact that it is a metal and is not stiff (like carbon), a fact that can be very annoying in poles without shock absorbers
