I do not know if the author is suggesting to do loving kindness meditation before reflecting on our fortunes, but I think that counting our fortunes, then sitting meditation and then loving kindness meditation would be the right order. 

Whatever the monk said on Facebook needs to be looked in context and should not be taken at face value. You will get that context only from that monk and hence I will not comment on what he said. Now coming to Christmas. It is the birth of a great saint Jesus Christ. Now one can surely celebrate the birthday of a saint, who gave the world a message of love, compassion and peace. Even he preached his followers 'Know Thyself'. So one should be mindful and instead of following the masses decide for oneself how to celebrate Christmas. Listen to this video of S N Goenka to get an idea of how one can celebrate Christmas. 

What is death according to Buddhism? When does it occur? Why do so many people die simultaneously in natural calamities? What did Buddha say about death? Please give references of Buddha's teachings.

Buddha said that the Dhamma he teaches is not a secret doctrine...By this he meant that the Dhamma is out in the open for everybody to know...It was there even before the times of Siddhartha Gautama. The only difference is Buddha stated it explicitly so that even lay people could understand it. Although the language of the priestly class during the times of Buddha was Sanskrit, Buddha taught in Prakrit/Pali the language of lay people so that everyone could practice it. Buddha's Dhamma is 'Svakkhato' i.e. it is well propounded and well explained by the Buddha. So in that sense it is not a secret doctrine. And regarding secret teachings, I don't know what exactly you mean by that. But to check if something is Buddha's Dhamma or not, one yardstick would be to check if the teaching helps us to 

The quote means that no one is going to punish us for our anger, those hellish fiery sensations which arise on our body are the punishment itself. Thus it is the anger which will punish you. Another quote on anger makes it more clear 'Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one who gets burned.' 

Just reply something to satisfy the lay person Give him/her a teaching on impermanence of everything 

Now I don't know the technique you had been practising...and the problem you are facing might be related to the way you practise too...but, in general, the mind has fallen into the habit pattern of wandering around here and there. And hence once you start trying to concentrate your mind it is natural for the mind to resist and this resistance is felt on the body in the form of unpleasant sensations...So, I would request you to continue the practice for at least 7-8 days for 10-15 minutes and see if the problem persists...Here is an excellent video by Ven Goenka on 'Mindfulness of Breath/Anapana Meditation'. It is also necessary that you start in small chunks of 15-20 minutes. Life on the path of liberation is like training for marathon...you start with warm up and then keep on adding to it consistently. 

So the 'true nature' is also subject to these aspects. It is also impermanent and hence can change for good or bad. It is important that one must realize these 3 aspects within oneself and not just understand them at a superficial mental level, the level of 'chintanmayi pradnya' - the one obtained by thinking, analyzing and pondering. These 3 aspects must be realized at the level of experience, the level of 'bhavanamayi pradnya' - experiential wisdom, which is gained through meditation. Assuming one needs to change the 'true nature' for good, i.e. become less agitated, less lustful etc. Any true change can only come about when we change the way our unconscious mind works. This is only possible when we have access to the unconscious mind. For that one needs 'concentration'. But concentration is antithetical to an agitated mind, to a lustful mind. Hence to gain concentration, one needs to practice 'morality' - one must try to keep the five precepts in daily life. One must try to do good deeds. With morality and concentration, one is able to develop 'wisdom' - which will take us to final liberation. So you ask, 'So can we change our 'true nature' by just doing good deeds? Or good deeds have to come from our true nature?' Initially one must start by doing good deeds, keeping precepts. But one must graduate to meditation (start by going to a meditation retreat) to develop concentration and wisdom, so that every deed we perform is beneficial for us and others. 

According to my teacher, which I feel is very much correct, we are taking refuge in the ideals of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. So whoever fulfills these ideals, we take refuge in them. Remember, that there were many Buddhas before Siddhartha Gautama. So what are these ideals? It is easy to come across these ideals in the Buddha Vandana. It says that the Buddha is - 1. the one who is Arahant which is portmanteau of Ari (evils) and Hant (destroy) which means destructions of all evils. 2. the one who is Samma Sam Buddha - one who has become fully enlightened. 3. the one who is Vijja Charan Sampanno which means who is perfect in wisdom and moral conduct. 4. the one who is Sugato - the one who has travelled a great path 5. the one who is Lokvidu which is again a combination of Lok(in ancient India, it was not only the world which was called Lok but this body of ours was also known as Lok) and Vidu(intelligent, knower); thus a knower of the world and the body 6. the one who is Anuttaro who is incomparable 7. the one who is Puris Dhamma Sarthi - Puris means men/women and Sarthi means the one who drives - thus he is the one who has turned the wheel of Dhamma 8. the one who is Satta Dev Manussana - the teacher of Gods and Humans 9. the one who is Bhagavati - the one who is enlightened and blessed Every Buddha who was ever born had these qualities and when we take refuge in Buddha, we take refuge in all of these qualities reminding ourselves of these virtues to be cultivated in ourselves. 

The Sasana of Gautama Buddha will last for 5000 years of which more than 2500 years are over. Ariya Maitreya will be the next Buddha. How long will the Sasana of Ariya Maitreya Buddha last? 

The Four Foundations of Mindfulness The Four Right Exertions The Four Bases of Power The Five Faculties The Five Powers The Seven Factors of Enlightenment The Noble Eightfold Path 

One of the main reasons for the decline of Buddhism in India is that it was engulfed by Hinduism in the years following the death of Buddha. India, before the time of Buddha was a Brahminical society dominated by Brahmins and Kshatriyas who were at the top of a four level caste system, the others being Vaishyas followed by Shudras. The Indian society was rife with rites and rituals which could be only performed by Brahmins. A householder throughout his existence was supposed to carry out various sacrifices which included animal slaughter and thus the vasihyas and the shudras suffered the most during pre-Buddha period. Now Buddha's teachings gave no value to rites and rituals and also he preached non-violence. This made Buddhism much popular among the vaishyas and shudras. This was of course a threat to Brahminical dominance and thus the livelihood of the priestly class. Hence there were many attempts by the priestly class to sabotage Buddhist teachings even during the time of Buddha but they were unsuccessful. After his death, they seem to have found success. Although Buddha negated the existence of God as is accepted in Hinduism, later Hindu fanatics made out Buddha himself to be a Hindu God. They declared him to be the 9th avatar of Vishnu, a Hindu God. 

Thus, one sees that Buddha directly exhorts the Sangha to thoroughly learn, cultivate, develop and frequently practice the following teachings for the benefit of oneself and many: 

Suppose a monk is invited to a house for food and the lay person asks how the food is? How does a monk reply to such a question. I am sure a monk in his lifetime comes across many such subjective questions. How should he deal with them? Does he: 

From the stories in Buddha's life, it is clear that he laid great emphasis on timing his teachings to someone. Many a time he would say that this is not the right time for him/her to learn the Dhamma. Having this in context, does it make sense to impart teaching at every possible opportunity. Please incorporate any stories if any to showcase the tradition. 

Buddha suggested that a lay person should not engage in five types of businesses; namely - business in weapons, in human beings, in meat, in intoxicants and in poison. This is Right Livelihood for a lay person (Source: Vanijja Sutta). So, I don't think being an artist violates any of these principles. Vipassana teacher S.N. Goenka said, "If the intention is to play a useful role in society in order to support oneself and to help others, then the work one does is right livelihood." Basically we have to be always mindful of our work. Check out these links: 

I would like to talk about the last part of your question. It is very noble of you to share the gift of Dhamma with everyone and it is true that Dhamma is invaluable. Since you have a family to take care of, I suggest you carry on with your profession for at least one year and side by side open a YouTube channel and/or a website where you could share your knowledge for free. Check the waters for a year to see if you earn sufficient Ad revenues. Also you could open a Patreon account where your grateful subscribers could donate for your living. And if that works out, you could even make everything Ad free. As I said test the waters for at least a year. 

I have problems meditating in the morning. I usually feel very tired when getting up early on a weekday and then have a limited timeframe (~ 30 min.) for meditation. My body feels so tired, that I am unable to meditate. This is often accompanied by the tendency to get into a negative, rejecting mindstate. Life is a Mind-Body phenomenon wherein the six senses are continuously coming in contact with their objects. Since we all have taken birth, the above process is unavoidable. Mental states affect our bodily states and vice versa. Hence, physical tiredness and negative mental states seem co-related. An effective way to deal with any problem is Yoniso Manasikara or wise reflection. This applies in conventional sense and also in the ultimate sense. In conventional sense, one tries to go to the root of the problem and then tries to get rid of the underlying causes of the problem. In ultimate sense, one tries to understand Anicca (Impermanence), Dukkha (Source of Suffering) and Anatta (Non Self) on the basis of sensations on the body and then realise that fretting over something that is Impermanent, Source of Suffering and Non Self is futile. Ven Yuttadhammo talks more about cultivating wisdom in this talk. The Importance of Wise Reflection by Steve Weissman is a nice article. It specifically talks about how to cultivate positive mental states in the morning. find peace of mind.” “May be able to let go of anger, fear, worry and ignorance. May also have patience, courage, wisdom and determination to meet and overcome difficulties and problems, challenges of life. May _ find peace of mind.” How fortunate we are Simply reflect on all the different ways that you are fortunate, materially and mentally. Watch out for the word “but”—it is not part of this reflection. This reflection is also very good when waking up each morning. It can be especially helpful to consider the odds of being born human compared to being born another being on this planet. Then consider how many have the chance to read or listen to the Dhamma. Then consider how many have the chance to actually practise the Dhamma. How very, very fortunate we are. To truly understand how fortunate we are is extremely helpful, in particular, with letting go of self-pity. This then allows more joy, contentment and energy to arise. Self-pity is a major hindrance for so many meditators. One main reason is because they are not looking at themselves objectively and truthfully. But in this practice we try to be objective with our view of life. We try to see life truly for what it actually is. Thus reflecting on how fortunate we are is a very simple and effective technique to find more inner peace. 

These 37 factors are together called as the BodhiPakkhiyaDhamma or 37 factors of Enlightenment. Now coming to this comment, 

Marriage demands mutual understanding not only between the marrying couple but between the two families. One of the most important thing you should consider before marrying a non Buddhist is if you would be able to continue your practice even after marriage. If you and your future husband are going to live by yourself without his family, then atleast he should know about your practice. If you are going to live with his family then its better that the whole family knows about your practice and that you would like to continue it. The story of Vishakha - chief laywoman disciple of Buddha would likely provide inspiration and guidance. $URL$ 

I am an above beginner level meditator - I have been practicing Vipassana meditation regularly for past 6-7 months - By regularly, I mean 1hr of sitting meditation at least 5 times a week. I have not been able to control my lust. I try to remain mindful during acts of sexual gratification...but they are like very few moments of awareness...rest of the time I am just going with the flow...Although I am a lay person, I want to be celibate...Please guide me. I remember a story wherein Buddha said to someone how one should eat as if they are eating their own child having lost in a desert...are there any such stories from Buddha's life/teachings regarding this subject...Basically I need some inspiration...Please share your experience if possible 

Also the suttas from the Pali canon are freely available these days on various sites. So the best way to capture these posers is to keep an open, rational and analytical mind and develop our own wisdom through the practice. 

I think one of the major proponents of 'Secular Buddhism' was S.N.Goenka, although I doubt if he himself would call his lineage that. First, let me give a brief idea of the tradition. S.N.Goenka's lineage could be traced back to Ven. Ledi Sayadaw, a Buddhist monk who was instrumental in reviving the practice of Vipassana. In his retreats, S.N.Goenka emphasizes on how the pain and suffering we face is universal irrespective of one's religion. And hence, he stresses, that the path of liberation from this suffering is also universal and not based on one's religion. He famously said at the UN's Millennium World Peace Summit that the only conversion involved in Vipassana is from misery to happiness, from bondage to liberation and from cruelty to compassion. You can also watch him introduce meditation to an audience at the Harvard Business Club here. A very primary book on Vipassana written by William Hart, one of his students is 'The Art of Living'. In this, he talks about basic Buddhist ideas like suffering, its cause and the path of coming out of it in a very secular fashion. You may look at some other books and CDs here. At his 10 day retreat, he gives discourses which are also very secular in nature. You can register for the retreat here. 

These are just guidelines. One might use their own criteria. Answers from different Mahayana schools are welcome. 

The word 'Bhava' as used in the Paticca Samuppada means Becoming. The Buddha explains that due to Vedana (feelings), one may out of Avijja (ignorance) generate Tanha (craving) which leads to Upadana (clinging) which in turn leads to Bhava. Now the same Vedana, out of Panna (wisdom), can lead to freedom from Bhava and take one to Nibbana. When the feelings arise, if one watches their impermanence and remains equanimous, one understands that craving for that feeling is futile. This generates wisdom. Coming to Atman, the Sanskrit word simply means 'self' or 'ego'. The Buddha taught the teaching of Anatta, the Pali for Anatman, which means non-self. It means that there is nothing in this structure of Body-Mind to be called self. Everything is impermanent and hence not suitable to clinging 

What kind of meditation are you practicing right now? I believe you are practicing Anapana and have not yet ventured into Vipassana. When you will start doing Vipassana, you will realise that there are vibrations constantly happening all over the body. We use these vibrations, this arising and falling of sensations to ascertain the reality of impermanence and anatta. So basically your mindfulness has increased making you aware of these sensations. A word of caution will be not to get attached to these sensations...sometimes you may not feel them and sometimes these sensations may be painful...remaining equanimous all the time is the key.
