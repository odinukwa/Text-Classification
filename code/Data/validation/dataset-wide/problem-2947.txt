Since one answer has provided the idealist perspective, I'm going to discuss its polar opposite: Logical Positivism. Before I do that, though, an important disclaimer is that despite logical positivism's status as the paradigm of natural sciences, it has long been dying in philosophy and is far from a popular position at the present. However, it is historically significant and a useful juxtaposition with idealism. The primary principle of logical positivism is that apart from the fundamentals of mathematical and linguistic logic (hence "logical"), all truths must be derived from empirical observation. Perhaps the biggest consequence of this is that to a logical positivist, if the answer to a question does not have any observable effect, then that question is meaningless. Thus, the question "does an inert metaphysical entity exist" is meaningless, because regardless of the answer our observations in the physical world will be precisely the same. The same physical observations means the same truths in logical positivism, so the answer to the aforementioned question becomes irrelevant. In the same way, a logical positivist would call your question meaningless, because whether or not objects exist when nobody is around, they always exist when someone is observing (at least in our experience), so the answer has no bearing on empirical observation. In terms of logical positivism, it's pointless to ask whether an unobserved object exists or not, precisely for the reason that nobody is looking at it. Regardless of what happens when everybody is dead, our observations won't change by definition of the situation (we only observe things when not everybody is dead), and so the question becomes meaningless. Of course, a big objection to all this is that these things should matter, and this is part of the reason logical positivism isn't doing so well. In some ways it dismisses ideas because "they don't affect me" when lots of philosophy is the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, regardless of practical implications. On the other hand, logical positivists generally take the hard-line that in truth these things are literally meaningless because truth depends fundamentally on empirical observation. 

Now, as pointed out by stoicfury, a non sequitur is merely an umbrella term encompassing many logical fallacies. The term you may be looking for is Ignoratio Elenchi, which is specifically: 

Basically. The Noble Lie, which says that all people are of the same earth but have just been born with different constitutions (Iron, Silver, Gold), was invented by the first guardians. From then on it was taught as truth to everybody, including the new guardians, and because of this myth they feel like the whole city is their kin, and give up their selfishness to protect their family. Unfortunately for the city, such myths are always vulnerable to someone's disbelief, and when that happens the whole system will collapse. 

I honestly cannot understand what this has to do with free will. Free will is hard to define, but roughly the philosophical definition is independence from external physical influences. If we have free will, then we are by default independent from these influences. Then, if we are told that certain actions will incur punishment, which is an external physical influence, nothing changes at all. Suppose you get a glass of water and want to drink it. If you have free will, then it is your independent decision to drink it. Then, suppose I tell you than though the water will quench your thirst, I put something in it to make it taste very bad. If you had free will before I told you about this "punishment", you will still have it afterward: it is still completely your decision. Knowledge of punishment is merely a factor in this decision - if you have free will from other influences, then this one too will not determine your choice in any way. There's nothing special about punishment that makes it more physically determinant than everything else in the world. Thus, whether God punishes us has nothing to do with free will. We either have it or we don't, and in either case punishment plays no role in determining our freedom. 

It is no secret that Nietzsche had contempt for democracy. In Beyond Good and Evil, he compared democrats, those people of democracy who think that humans are all equal and free, to a herd of farm animals (section 44 in the second part, "The Free Spirit"). Thus, he clearly finds the concept of freedom in democracy, and of democracy itself, laughable. Nietzsche also has a well developed concept of the "free spirit," one that he relates to often. The phrase "we free spirits" or something of the like has appeared more than once in his writings. His free spirit is one who is not trapped by morality, by a closed view of the world, but one who can see humanity for what it is and understand it properly. Consequently, it seems quite apparent to me that the free spirit should not be a democrat. However, the following passage (coming after a short fictional response to his words) from On the Genealogy of Morals has confused me: 

Hobbes would probably not tell you to fight back and gain honor, because your first quotation indicates that he looks unfavorably upon what he calls "Vain Glory." Given that quotation, he would probably say that if you actually try to retaliate against the bully, you would have that very "false esteeme" of your own strength; any honor you gain would be false, and only meaningful to yourself. The bully has been dominating you, so you either fight back and fail, or you succeed but gain nothing but vain glory. It's a lose-lose situation, because inevitably either your body or your mind will experience a loss (vain glory, to Hobbes, is negative for the mind. It leads you to see yourself as above others, while he says that all are equal in their rights). However, if you were to seek peace, he would likely praise you for being reasonable. In your second quotation, he explicitly says "that peace is to be sought after where it may be found." He only says that that you should prepare for war if peace can not be found. Also, note that he says that even if peace can't be found, you should prepare for, but not declare war. From the quotations, it seems that Hobbes treats war as a last resort. Therefore, the victim of the bully would do best, from Hobbes' perspective, to escape from the situation. 

This was Machiavelli's identifying line to many people, and in my conversations with them, I got the impression that Machiavelli meant the following: that, given an ends profitable enough, any means, even a very immoral one, is justifiable. Thus, I lived with this impression for a while, until I actually read The Prince and got to the line in question (at the end of Chapter 18). In specific context, its meaning seems very different: 

What you may be looking for is the Coherentist school of thought, of which Laurence BonJour is a pioneer. Coherentism holds that, in order for a belief to be knowledge, it simply needs to be justified by being consistent with an existing "system of belief." If, however, some belief is inconsistent with the existing system of beliefs (i.e. causes a contradiction), it cannot be considered knowledge. The primary objective of coherentism is to overcome the infinite regress problem of knowledge, that is, that some "inferential" knowledge A must come from B, which is inferential and so must come from C, etc. While foundationalists establish a theory of "non-inferential" knowledge, that which does not require more knowledge to be justified, coherentists place their justification in consistency with some chosen system of belief. I think this sort of "new knowledge must be consistent with what all the stuff we have" is what you're asking for. 

However, in his theology, Aquinas is very Christian. Although he took much from Aristotelian philosophy, he did not attempt to combine it with Christian theology, and the concept of creationism. The SEP points out that his philosophical acceptance of Aristotle does not mean that "he never disagrees with his sources." The eternity of the universe is one of these points of disagreement; Aquinas takes Aristotle's view very seriously, but simply disagrees with it. He does not attempt to argue that Aristotle saw his own philosophy of eternity as somehow flawed. Response from Al-Farabi Al-Farabi, one of the first major Muslim philosophers, was a scholar of Aristotle. However, in his philosophical writings (obviously influenced, and actually motivated, by Islam) he "breaks with the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle." He too takes Aristotle seriously, but he attempts to reconcile his (and Plato's) philosophy with a First Cause (a principle of Islam), "using him as an authority when it suited [his] purposes, and knowing that philosophy was a 'foreign science' in need of an external authority as it lacked an indigenous authority"(source). Al-Farabi, having drawn from not just Aristotle, but Plato and even Ptolemy in his metaphysics, does use Aristotle's principles of causation. However, equally important to him is the concept of a First Cause. Thus, Al-Farabi considers Aristotle arguments to represent his beliefs, but simply does not agree with some of them. This view is similarly held by the majority of medieval Islamic philosophers. Summary Aristotle's efforts to support his idea of an eternal universe, not created ex nihilo, indicate a strong belief in what he is trying to prove; if he saw his arguments as flawed, why would he attempt to convey them? The medieval responses act as the "classic commentators" you ask for in your question; although they do not directly respond, they do indicate that the classic (perhaps, medieval) view of Aristotle held that he believed his own philosophy to be true; thus, they simply make a point to disagree with him. As for a contemporary view, the SEP is always reliable, and offers no indication that there is a mainstream questioning of Aristotle's own beliefs about the eternity of the universe. Rather, he went to great lengths to establish and support them, and they are about as important to him as his other principles. Unfortunately, I cannot offer specific commentaries, but the difficulty in finding any that question Aristotle's personal beliefs speaks to my argument. 

A very nice articulation of basically this problem is from C.S. Lewis in What the Tortoise said to Achilles. As a short summary, the Tortoise presents the following to Achilles: 

The last portion is particularly important, where Plato asserts that the human soul must be educated and developed "until it is able to endure looking at... the good." Thus, unlike the decay of education in the city, which leads to a decay of regimes, the soul is actually accumulating a better education, and therefore state with time. Why do I say that the best education is required for the best soul (the aristocratic)? Well, when discussing the oligarchic man (of the 3rd regime, that which values money), Plato comments: 

People in my class take can only interpret this a priori primarily based on their own views and prejudices, generally either arguing that Nietzsche is making a pure relativist judgment of physics or that he is pointing out the epistemological limitations of physics as highly empiricist. That Nietzsche is discussing empiricism is apparent in his mention of why we believe in physics and where we get our physical laws from in the first place. It's also pretty obvious that he's questioning the credibility of physics by denying it the title of "a world explanation." However, I can't figure out the details of what exactly he is saying. So, just what is Nietzsche saying about physics in this passage? Obviously there is some historical context involved ("it is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds") and maybe Nietzsche is making some physical argument, but I'm having a hard time reading any particular argument out of it. 

This is a very important concept in statistical experiments, with the issue being a confounding variable. The researchers are making the common mistake of assuming that correlation implies causation, whereas many examples (such as yours) explicitly demonstrate that this is not true. There are a host of methods meant to avoid this kind of mistake, like having a control, pairing subjects, etc. I don't know of a particularly formal formulation of this error, but it can be called the false cause fallacy. 

Cicero's Hortensius, though effectively lost to us, appears to have been an answer to this very question. Hortensius was a contemporary of Cicero who suggested that Philosophy was useless because it had no practical value. Cicero's reply? From what we know, he argued (in only a slightly tongue-in-cheek manner): 

There is some confusion in my philosophy class about Nietzsche's statements on physics in section 14 of Beyond Good and Evil. The specific portion in question is below, although as with all of Nietzsche, context matters: 

We can see from this is that history deals with events, while genealogy deals with lines of development (it would be reasonable to claim from this that genealogy is a branch of history). This carries the corollary that history does not have to assert any connection between what it talks about, while genealogy by definition seeks to make some sort of developmental or evolutionary claim regarding how certain things are related. The latter is precisely what Nietzsche does in the Genealogy of Morals. He isn't simply listing off a bunch of facts about what morality was here and what it happened to be there. Rather, he's making a claim that he can trace a line through the development of morality itself. He begins with his idea of "Good vs. Bad" as it manifested itself in the society of nobility and common people. He then argues for how this evolved into "Good vs. Evil" through the "priestly" people (he credits the Jewish people) and their daring "inversion of morals." He also makes claims, often using his linguistic expertise, on how guilt developed in the debtor-creditor relationship and how this ultimately grew - and was inverted to - guilt in the prime creditor (God) toward the debtors (man). This is the sort of thing Nietzsche talks about in the Genealogy: lines marking the development of human morality through the course of civilization. It's because he argues that this is a decidedly causal and evolutionary process that he chooses to call it a "genealogy" and not simply a "history," which is much less specific in its meaning. 

Is: certainly, but you have to keep in mind their specific source of epistemology. All philosophers argue from their own epistemology; primarily logic, but there are also many points of difference, such as when a rationalist argues from theory while an empiricist argues from physical observations (not that the two are mutually exclusive). Ordinary language philosophers argue from the epistemology of existing language, and it is about how different philosophers perceive this language that there would be argumentation. Therefore, you could expect significant argumentation among ordinary language philosophers about what certain terms ought to mean, and you will find that they try to establish normative definitions - it's just that these definitions and arguments take their epistemology from language. In summary, this parallelism is useful: Empiricists create normative definitions and argue about what terms ought to mean from their physical observations. Rationalists create normative definitions and argue about what terms ought to mean from their mental reasoning. Ordinary language philosophers create normative definitions and argue about what terms ought to mean from their observation of language. 

For virtually all of your philosophical needs, I would recommend the Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. It has excellent and rather concise summaries of most important topics in philosophy, and if you're looking for a quick intro, it's an excellent source. Other than that, there may be scattered summaries of various ideas, but to address your main concern: philosophy is often about being as clear as you can be, and generally that requires extensive elaboration. What seems (and usually is) superfluous is also essential to avoiding misinterpretation, since of all the people who read a work it's almost inevitable that one of them will need more than the bare minimum explanation. However, "trivia" as you put it is not universal in philosophy and there are many philosophers who will leave it out. In contemporary writings it's a tad more common to see random facts being used, but in older works that sort of thing is much more rarer. In general I don't think philosophical writings are as unnecessarily long as you say. For example, Machiavelli's The Prince is a concise (about 80 pages, if memory serves) book on political philosophy, and though it uses many examples these are all essential to his points. Nietzsche's writings are also often presented in concise form, though they do bear literary embellishment, and also Nietzsche is one of the most opaque philosophers around. Wittgenstein's Tractatus is perhaps the most concise work you'll find, but this comes at the price of being very difficult to understand. So in short, I recommend the SEP for short summaries, and I don't think the situation is quite as bad as you make it out to be since there are a good number of philosophers who do manage to be concise.
