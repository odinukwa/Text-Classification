This news story is based on an article from Science The image is also taken from the same Science magazine article. The text here is a procedural text, it describes the process of using a trapezium to make distance-speed-time calculations, for approximation of the motion of Jupiter along the ecliptic. You should look at the original article in science and the author's website 

Our time does not slow down due to the expansion of the universe. And time will not stop. However time dilation does occur, and this is something different. When something is moving at a very high velocity, relative to us, we see time slowing down for it. As more distant galaxies are moving away from us at great speeds, events in those galaxies would (from our point of view) appear to run slower. This is observed in the at which supernovae brighten and fade described in this paper. The inhabitants of those galaxies would not perceive any change in the rate of time. (rather they would see our clocks slow down, as we are the ones moving fast, from their perspective) The rate of expansion is increasing (though why this should be is mysterious) but no part of the universe will accelerate to the speed of light, as nothing may travel at the speed of light. So time dilation will remain finite. 

The short answer is no. There is no huge accelerations of star systems. Look at a pair of interacting galaxies These are the Antenna galaxies (image copyright Star Shadows Remote Observatory and PROMPT/CTIO, from apod) You will see the long "antennae", which are formed of stars which have been ejected from their galaxies by the interaction. But the accelerations needed are not large, because the interaction takes a long time. The acceleration nothing like $km/s^2$, The force required to accelerate a planet like that would smash it. remember 1$km/s^2$ is about 100g. But small accelerations over long periods can have big effects. The only way to cause objects to accelerate is to apply a force, and the only force that can move planets is gravity. A galaxy has a great big gravitational field, but it is very spread out, and as you note, most of the galaxy is empty space. Planet orbits should be stable, certainly inner planets would remain bound to their stars. There could be disruption to oort clouds, but the gravitational field around a star would not change much. Similarly the star's magnetosphere would not be changed much. As above there are no large forces applied to stars or planets. A close-ish approach, to 1 light year, would cause disruption of the oort cloud, but nothing more. Stars may have larger relative motions, but no where near enough to cause blue shifting of light into x-ray, in fact it would be hard for observers on the planet to tell which stars came from which galaxy. Andromeda is approching at 120km/s. But proper motions of stars in the milkyway can be greater than this, Barnards star has a relative velocity of 142km/s At the end of the interaction, the star and its planet is likely to be scattered to the halo of an elliptical galaxy. 

Right now it doesn't look like much. It has a magnitude of about 12. And appears as a single point of light. So it requires the upper end of amateur equipment to observe. If you want to measure the variation, which is only 0.2 magnitudes, you would need to take images. So you would need a proper photo-imaging system. In other words it is a tricky amateur target. You could try using an online telescope. The star is within the range of the Bradford robotic telescope. (Except this is offline and doesn't have an expected date to be back in service :( In the Digital sky survey (using professional equipment), the star appears in the centre of this image. This has very high magnification, this image is about 4 arcminutes across, about 1/8 the apparent size of the moon. 

Planetarium software, such as Stellarium, or astronomical computation software such as pyephem can compute the exact position of the sun at any date, time and location. It is then simple trigonometry to calculate the length of a shadow: if the sun is $\theta$ degrees above the horizon, a vertical building of height $h$ will cast a shadow on horizontal ground of length $\frac{h}{\tan(\theta)}$. 

The frequency of the detected waves is too fast. The detector found something that rotated several hundred times a second, and then stopped. The amplitude is too big. Even though Jupiter is close, the gravitational waves it produces in its orbit are extraordinarily weak. Far too weak for us to detect them (good thing too, because if it was producing powerful gravitational radiation, it would start to spiral into the sun) 

Define "current". If one particle makes a current, there are lots of particles that hit the Earth at energies much more than 0.98c, most famously the "Oh my god particle" If you have many particles travelling at these speeds you don't have a river, more a beam, or a jet or particles. These are produced by active accretion disks around black holes. 

The video shows the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram which shows the two groups. It correctly describes Main Sequence type M stars as smaller, redder and dimmer than the sun. It then gives Betelgeuse as an example of a Red Giant. Which is larger and brighter than the sun, yet still cooler on the outside. 

Magnitude is defined relative to a standard flux of a magnitude 0 object $F_0$. $$M = -2.5\log(F/F_0)$$ if the error is $F_E$, then $F =F_0\pm F_E$, so the magnitude M is $$ -2.5\log((F_0+F_E)/F_0) < M <-2.5\log((F_0-F_E)/F_0)$$ The errors here are tiny in comparison to the measured flux, only one part in 10000, so the range of magnitudes is similarly tiny +-0.0001 

It is a very good place for Earth Life, but that is because we have evolved and adapted to this planet. For example, we like to have an atmospheric pressure of about 1000 mBar, and a partial O2 pressure of about 200 mBar, which is exactly what the atmosphere provides. Earth would be a very bad place for a species to which oxygen was toxic. A species that hadn't evolved here would probably find conditions challenging in one way or another. 

So, the presenter explains that two observers who are not moving relative to one another will agree on the meaning of "now". However if one observer is moving, then they will no longer agree, and what one considers to be now will be in the past or future of the other. He observes that a sufficiently distant observer, in another galaxy 100 million light years away that is moving at "bicycle" speed relative to us would have a 200 year discrepancy in their understanding of "now". But this alien would have absolutely no way of observing our universe now. They could not see us in our "now", nor in their "now" of 200 years ago, because they are 100 million light years away. They can only observe how our galaxy was 100 million years ago. They can certainly not observe our galaxy in the future, even if they travel towards us at speeds approaching the speed of light. So the explanation of different "now" is about agreement on clocks, not about actual observations. I think then the program errs by treating Special Relativity as a full description of nature, rather than as a model. Relativity is a classical theory, in that in Relativity, if you know the initial state, you can predict the future state. There is no uncertainty principle in general relativity. It is correct to say that in Relativity the future is as real as the past. It is unclear if the same is true in Quantum Mechanics, it depends on how you interpret the maths. Whether the future exists or not cannot be answered by theory. Since different interpretations of QM are based on the same maths, there is no way of testing which interpretation of quantum mechanics is "correct" or even whether calling an interpretation "correct" has any scientific meaning. In the "many worlds" interpretation, the notion of a single space-time which you can take slices of is lost completely. I might note that I'm not a great fan of the explanations in that series, which seem to me to be confusing on a number of levels, and are more aimed at creating "wow" than being clear. For example, the mixed metaphor of "slices of bread and aliens riding bikes" seems to have confused you into thinking that there are aliens who are already seeing how our planet will be 200 years from now. 

We don't know for sure. If we knew the answer, then we'd have a new standard model and then the reconnection speed would be nicely comparable to what's predicted. (zibadawa timmy) However, the typical models of magnetic reconnection do not account for the extra resistivity that results from small-scale electromagnetic waves, which can be upwards of ~12-15 orders of magnitude larger than that caused by Coulomb collisions.

For a game engine, speed is good. If the gaps in time are on the order of milliseconds (of real time) then simply not interpolating should be undetectable. 

We know how long stars take to orbit in a spiral galaxy, because we know how big galaxies are (we can measure the size by knowing the distance using various methods such as Cepheid variables, and type Ia supernovae) and we know how fast the stars are moving. (We can measure the velocity of stars using the doppler method) We know how long stars last for because we have a good model of how stars work. We can use this model to predict that large, hot stars will burn themselves out in a short time. We can verify this model by looking at the numbers of blue stars, red supergiants and supernovae. From the first part we know that stars take about 250 million years to complete an orbit of the Milky way (which is typical for similar sized galaxies) From the second part, we know that giant blue stars live for only tens of million years, and so could not complete a full orbit of the milky way. On the other hand, smaller stars like the sun live for billions of years and so make multiple orbits. 

No. That's not what a black hole is. A black hole is a vacuum solution to general relativity. In other words a black hole is just mass, without a "thing" left to be massive. The mass is collapsed to a singularity, and is surrounded by an event horizon. If you pass over the event horizon, every path you can take in will lead you to the singularity. In this sense the singularity is more like a point in time than a point in space. You can't "see" the singularity, since it is always in your future (you can only see things that are in the past) There is no "thing" at the singularity, There are no protons neutrons or higgs bosons, and any that are formed will find themselves at the singularity, and ceasing to exist in a short time. So black holes are very very weird. They can't be easily understood my analogy. They are understood in terms of Einstein's mathematical theory of general relativity. 

There is a website: $URL$ that has a javascript program for converting state vectors to orbital elements and back. The source of that website is possible to convert to python: Here is a class that has a method for calculating orbital elements based on that website. The method takes one argument, a body the is the Principal (ie the Sun)
