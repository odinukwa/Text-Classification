There are no easy answers here - even experienced campers can find this a challenging decision and getting it wrong has significant consequences. You will have to clarify your personal priorities and then do a fair bit of research. Portability - the single most important consideration The central issue is portability - most of your other decisions will flow from this. If you are only carrying your shelter for short distances your priority will be comfort in camp. If you are covering the miles, you would be wise to prioritise weight. But once you prioritise weight, you have to decide what you will sacrifice for lightness. Here are the key trade-offs you should consider. The right answer will depend on your budget, the conditions and your personal preferences. Trade-off #1) Weight vs Budget There is a huge range of prices, from cheap generic Asian imports through mid-market outdoor brands up to small artisan and expedition specialists. You have to decide what you are prepared to spend. In general the more you pay, the better the design, construction and materials, and the more performance you will get at any given weight. Trade-off #2) Weight vs Durability & Storm-worthiness In general the lighter and more portable the tent, the more care it will need in use, the shorter the expected life, and the more you have to shelter it from wind and snow loads. Trade-off #3) Weight vs Space, Comfort & Convenience In general, the lighter the shelter the tighter the internal space and the less comfort & convenience in use. So if you prioritise lightness you need to consider what sacrifices you are prepared to make: 

Factory applied - which should last for the life of the garment and is offered by an increasing range of manufacturers After-market application by a specialist service Washing it into your clothing Spraying it onto your clothing, which should last up to 6 weeks provided you hand wash or use a wool programme (it is damaged by vigorous washing).

Stings can be toxic enough to cause you difficulties. I'm not sure how you can be so confident that there are no jellyfish where you swim. The farther out you are, the more difficult it becomes to get back to shore if you are badly stung. 4 - Sudden illness or incapacity Any sudden incapacity in deep water can be fatal, so cramp, heart-attack, stroke, asthma etc will have more serious consequences, particularly if you are swimming alone. A friend of mine drowned while swimming in warm water when it seems that he simply fainted. He was young, fit and healthy and had never fainted before, so we'll never know why it happened. A prominent member of the wild swimming community in Devon where I live was found drowned while swimming solo in open water. He was super-fit and highly experienced. You can improve your chances of surviving an incapacity by learning the Drownproofing technique, which enables you to float efficiently without full use of your arms and legs. Clearly, the farther out you are the more difficult it becomes to survive any sudden incapacity. So while you couldn't say that offshore swimming in the Med is unjustifiable, the dangers are significant. Especially if you are swimming alone, it would be more prudent to swim parallel to the shore where you can reach safely quickly if you get into trouble. Is it really worth the extra risk to swim farther out? Only you can decide - but do it with a realistic understanding of the risks. 

Check the weather forecast before your climb, and on your phone or pocket radio during the climb if you have reception. In the US, you could also use weather radio. Ask locals and rangers about local patterns and what signs to watch out for. For example in the Western Alps local guides have given me very specific advice about the warning signs of afternoon thunderstorms on a specific range at a specific time of year. Carry an altimeter and watch for sudden drops in pressure. Stay alert to obvious signs such as the wind backing, a lowering cloud ceiling or fast developing cumulonimbus formations. 

This is the equivalent of around 20 lbs in your pack. I still see a lot of people shod like this, particularly continentals in the Western Alps. Now (unless it's icy) I walk the hills in minimalist shoes like these, at around 1lb per pair. This is the equivalent of dropping over 15lbs from my pack. 

The Cure The reversed needle may not be exactly 180 degrees out so you'll need to fix the needle instead. According to respected manufacturer Silva: 

Explaining the closure makes it more likely that people will understand the reason and comply. In the Western Alps you sometimes come across chord or tape across a trail with no reason given, which makes it difficult to evaluate whether to ignore it or not. The alternative to a notice would be some kind of a physical barrier, but this would likely hamper local people going about their business. 

Well, there's the obvious issue that the bottom may shelve very steeply, so that non-swimmers trying to paddle may drown. Beyond that, I think there's a specific point and a more general point. Specifically, deep water is more dangerous in terms of cold water shock. In the first 3-5 minutes after entering cold water there can be a gasp reflex or muscle spasms that might cause intake of water into the lungs. Also, blood pressure and heart rate are raised, which can cause heart problems or stroke. Deep water will remain colder than shallow water. And if the swimmer gets into trouble, they will likely be out of their depth. Also, as has been pointed out in the comments, the banks will often be steep and harder to exit. The accidents tend to happen to young men with a macho approach to cold water. According to RoSPA (The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents): 

A key part of the answer is to wear socks that dry more quickly. Most of my life I've never really questioned the superiority of Merino loop socks such as the SmartWool PHDs. But I've begun to realise that once they get wet they are slow to dry and unpleasant to put on when cold. So recently I've been experimenting with Bridgeport CoolMax synthetic liner socks. It's been an eye-opener. Much lighter than loop socks, so you can save weight or carry more pairs for the same weight. Comfortable when wet, and dry very quickly by body-heat on the foot. I can't emphasise this enough - thin socks dry much more quickly than looped wool socks. And they are much less unpleasant to put on when cold and damp. They are pretty durable. And much to my surprise, the stink factor is no worse than Merino. I thought I'd miss the padding, but I haven't noticed any negative effect. And not so much as a hot-spot since I switched. Also, if you use lightweight footwear you can build a system around them. You can layer them in the cold (with a vapour barrier between layers in wet cold). Or you can wear a single pair in the heat. And with a single pair, you get more room in the shoe to add a removable rockplate for gnarly going or a thin impact-absorbing insole for road walking. So here's my drying strategy now:
