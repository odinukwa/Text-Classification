I've looked for his profile everywhere and cannot find it to delete or fix it. System Properties > Advanced > User Profiles shows my profile, the Administrator profile and the Default Profile. HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList only shows my profile and the Administrator profile. Everything that I've found on the internets points me to those locations. Help a brotha out? 

My problem arises when I sign into the in-built administrator account on the PDC. Though that account is part of the Domain Admins and Administrator groups, I do not have permission to view the subfolders and files. I don't see any inherited permissions that should prevent me from doing anything I want inside of these folders. Is there some magical button I have to hit when opening the folders? This is becoming increasingly frustrating. 

I can access it, but I cannot write to it. Windows keeps telling me I "need permission to perform this action" Where do I start? 

I'm trying to use the in-built Remote Assistance (RA) software in Windows 7 to support my users. I initiate a RA session with the user and ask to remotely control their desktop. They tick a little check box that says something to the effect of 'allow helper to respond to UAC prompts' and it pops up with a UAC prompt. The user cannot respond to the UAC prompt because they're not a local administrator - I am. Isn't that what that little check box is for??? I've found this on TechNet from back in '07 on Vista. From what I've found, I could disable UAC (terrible idea) or make all my users local administrators on their computers (yet another terrible idea). I'm hoping that MS has fixed this little oversight in Windows 7. Remote Assistance is completely useless to me if I can't respond to UAC prompts with my username and password 

A while back I was in a conference call and I clicked on the 'people options' menu in the call window and selected 'mute audience' to mute everyone while I gave a lecture. Now when internal users call into my conference call in the conference bridge (using the 'join online meeting' link in the email that's created with the 'new online meeting' button in Outlook), they join muted. I've tried unchecking that box, but everyone is still muted when they join the call. I've tried changing my conference information (using the 'Reset my Assigned Conference information' link in the dialin options) to give me a new conference ID but that doesn't help; people are still joining muted. Is there an attribute somewhere that I modified by muting the audience once that I have to change back to make it so that members don't join the conference muted? 

Also, if anyone else was having problems with this, I've found another thing that may prevent TCP/IP printers from mapping correctly. A user cannot add a printer to the computer they're on if they're not an administrator on that computer. When trying to add the printer manually, they will be asked for the username and password of an administrator. When the GPO is adding the printer on login, it cannot ask for an administrator account so it just errors out while trying to add the printer. The Point and Print Restrictions GP under Computer>Policies>Administrative Templates>Printers is your ticket to solving this problem. Set the When installing drivers for a new connection: and the When updating drivers for an existing connection: settings to Do not show warning or elevation prompt and it will install the printers just fine. 

I built this WDS server that I made into a RODC also. After running the dcpromo, it get this error message that the WDS service is not started and could not start. I found this so I tried changing the logon account to my domain admin account. Now it gives me an error when I try to start the service saying: 

User is using Outlook 2010 connecting to Exchange 2010, along with Lync 2010 with UM enabled. When she gets a voicemail, it should show up in her inbox looking like an email with transcription and an mp3 of the voicemail. When you open the voicemail ('email') it shows 'form region could not be opened' in the preview pane. When she clicks on 'forward' to create a forwarded message, the transcription shows up and the mp3 is there. In troubleshooting, I turned off the 'Microsoft Exchange Add-in' and it made the preview appear - the problem was solved. I'm trying to find out more about this Microsoft Exchange Add-in. There's not much that I've found out there that tells me exactly what this add-in does. Can anyone shed some light on what it's for? Will I run into any trouble by having it disabled? 

I have a bunch of linux virtual servers left over from a previous IT department. They have names like 'magic' or 'stuff'. I'm not quite sure what they're doing...or if I need them... How would you guys and gals go about finding out the purpose of these machines? (besides turning them off and seeing what breaks) 

Using Exchange 2010. I have a single-domain cert for mail.mydomain.com now and I know I need more than that. I want to get a wildcard cert but I've got a guy that's telling me that wildcard certs won't work on cell phones. I want to support iPhones and Android phones; will one wildcard cert do the job? The more I read, the more confused I get. Can someone help me out? 

I just set up an Exchange server to replace my DeskNow mail server. I want to start testing my internet mail exchange of my Exchange server. I can only set the MX records on my DNS up to my one external IP address so I was thinking that I could set up a firewall rule on my internet-facing firewall that port forwarded the smtp packets to two different servers. My question is: If I do that, will that mean that the smtp packets will be forwarded to just the first internal IP on the list? Or does it mean that the packet will be cloned and sent to both IPs? 

I see that there were ways in Exchange 2003 and Exchange 2007 to just put in an LDAP query and it would populate the group for you. Is there any way to do that in Exchange 2010? I know there's dynamic distribution groups but I don't want to create the group based on one of their pre-set queries and I don't want to mess around with "custom attributes". I just want to put an LDAP query in there and make it run it to populate the distribution group. 

and then a bunch of diagnostic information that I don't want to paste here because I don't want to have to censor all of the sensitive information contained (lazy) Can you guys throw me some possible reasons why this would happen? If there are an innumerable number of reasons, where should I start to troubleshoot this? 

I'm creating a new Exchange 2010 environment to replace the DeskNow system that my company is using currently. I don't have any experience with Exchange at all. I have the main roles installed and they appear to be working internally. AD is doing its job; I can hook up Outlook 2007 with next to no effort. I can even get to OWA. By all indications I have a working internal mail system (that nobody is using at the moment). Now I want to be able to exchange mail with the Internets. I've been reading a few books on the subject and everyone says that I don't need an Edge Transport server - but that's as far as they go. They don't tell me how to set up Internet mail exchange without the Edge Transport server, they just go right into how to set one up and how to use it as an SMTP gateway. So I turn to you. How does mail get to the Internet without the Edge Transport server? What goes in my DMZ? And, if everyone agrees that I need one, can it be a virtual machine or do I need an entirely new server? 

I'm trying to install Exchange 2010 to a server in a site that uses an RODC. It tells me that "No domain controllers for the domain DOMAIN and the site SITE are available" I'm going to be moving the Exchange server to the site with the main RW DC soon but I wanted to install Exchange before moving it. Is this possible? 

I have an image of Windows 7 with Office 2010 installed that I'm trying to push out to my domain users but when they open Office for the first time, it asks them for a username and password for an administrator account. I know that it's not critical and they can get to the program without imputing the username/password but my users don't. To eliminate the support calls I know that I'm going to get, is there a way to bypass this? Even completely eliminate the 'first run' BS that Office has? 

My boss sent out an email from my Exchange 2010 org and attached a PDF and a Word doc to it. He came back the next day and told me that some of the 8 or 10 people that received this email could open up the attachments no problem. The other 2 or 3 people, could not. One of these people who could not open the attachment, went so far as to call Comcast (his email service provider) and ask them where his attachments went. Comcast told this person that when they received the email, the attachment was 0 bytes in size. This may sound like more of a rant than a question but I'm genuinely concerned. Is there any possible way that something could have gone wrong on my end that sent out the email to some with the attachment and to some without?
