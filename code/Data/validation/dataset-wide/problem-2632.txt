I'm struggling to make the jump from the Paradox of Tolerance to the Liars Paradox - can someone help me with this? My question is: Is "Intolerance of intolerance" equivalent to the Liar's Paradox? 

My question is: Is there evidence to suggest Evolutionary Psychology is essentially Leibnitizian Optimisim? 

I'm hunting through Plato quotes and I can't find this one. (But it sounds plausible.) My question is: Did Plato say "In order to argue, you must express your opponents argument better than they could?" 

Truth by authority - this is true because a judge, a scientific authority, a person at the top of an organisation, or a well-recognised book/publication said it was true - and I don't need to question it further. Truth by reasoning (rationalism) - this is true because someone has given me a bunch of reasons, and I have weighed it in my head, and I can't come up with a competing set of reasons that knocks it down - so it is valid in my head. Truth by experiment (Empiricism) - this is true because I saw it or felt it. Further more I could repeat it, and if you repeat it, you will see the truth of it as well. Truth by message (testimonial evidence) - I heard this message from a person I trust, and I hold their observations of reality as true. You can choose to listen to their message as well. 

I gather that the lack of a free will implies a lack of moral certainty. Since we cannot choose any of our actions, we cannot be accountable for them? And since this "law" of deterministic finitude assumes the materialization of consciousness, reason, and experience, then all knowledge and thoughts are likewise determined. In all honestly, at this point, I am extremely tempted to work backwards causally to explain from where we originate, but I promised that I wouldn't. Moving on-wards. You did not account for a plenum of matter in the universe, or rather, if every possible point in the universe (including points that contain no matter) are affected. So, I will now consider two cases: Case 1 (the plenum): If the universe is a true plenum of matter, then we find ourselves in a Leibnizian/Parmenidean system of a monad. Put simply: There can be no difference among everything, since everything is matter. It would then follow that: 

was right. From the conditions you gave were not entirely satisfactory for an certainty of a conclusion. I suggest taking your thoughts backwards causally (what I stopped myself from doing earlier). By working backwards, you'll possibly come to a cause of the existence of everything and thus learn more about the finitude in which you're thinking. Otherwise, we have a nebulous account of deterministic existence, that assumes all things are and are matter, which was historically bonked over the head and thrown into a dream world by Descartes and then later crushed by Kant ("the crusher of everything" -Schopenhauer). So that premise has some philosophical problems too. Good luck. 

This question has more to do with ideology then philosophy but something seems off in terms of logic. The Oxford dictionary defines collectivism as: 

P1 AND P2 Or could one consider that nincompoop and bully as interdependant? In other words, that being a nincompoop leads someone to being a bully or being a bully leads to being a nincompoop or they just happen to correlate. How can I ascertain all of this to understand the reasoning? Edit: Question details modified as requested in comment below. Edit: Question details further modified. 

Just thinking about this logically. Change can be observed by comparing the state of something, let's say a system, at moment A with its state at moment B situated in the future. So by definition change depends on time. In turn this would mean that if the state of a system is altered within the very same instant it could not be considered as change since there is no moment B to compare with. So, can there be change if there is no time? Maybe, but we wouldn't know since we're smack bang in the middle of it and need comparison to establish change has taken place. As for the intrinsic connection between time and space, I am not a physicist either but this paper titled "Now, and the Flow of Time" may be of interest. 

$URL$ A logical argument (and usually when thus termed, considered an outright fallacy) describing the erroneous argument that the thinking, art, or science of an earlier time is inherently inferior to that of the present, simply by virtue of its temporal priority. 

Everything we have come to know is an illusion of difference. From this, we have come to the wrong conclusions about free will, "creation", etc.. However, we are all one and imperishable. But, it would then follow that motion cannot be. This was a big problem for Plato. If every point in the universe is filled with matter, then if any bit of matter moves, then there is a difference between the prior position and the current one. But we can't have difference because this would assume that there was a part of existence that the matter could move into and thus contradict both the assumed plenum and the true lack of difference. So, we come to a somewhat paradoxical conclusion that all of existence really has no motion or direction. Everything just is, is one, and is still. If this were the only assumption and there was no account for a beginning of creation, then we could accept pure nihilism. Hmmm. Case 2 (no plenum): Everything is completely determined, but there are empty spaces in the universe. This case is more aligned with current models in physics than the previous case. Nevertheless, we still have determinism from material finitude. From that we can once again extrapolate various claims of nihilism and meaninglessness. Not very exciting of a framework, huh? Anyway, your thought: 

Now applying this to the original comment - it seems that most observations of the supernatural come from the 4th category - truth my message (sometimes called Revelation). The original comment seems to be saying that philosophy and logic lie in the first three spaces, Truth by authority, Truth by reasoning (rationalism) and Truth by experiment (Empiricism). To me that seems limited. I think you can still reason about all four types of truth claims - but I'm open to the idea that philosophy may have particular boundaries. I understand the original poster was trying to say that supernatural claims are inherently outside the bounds of experimental truth. My question is: Are philosophical claims grounded in the observations of the material world around us? (With regard to supernatural claims) 

Now on a simplistic level - this appears to be a Karmic idea. But I wanted to find the origin of what he was quoting. All my google searches came up with nothing. (Perhaps I'm spelling it wrong). Has anyone heard of a worldview that sounds (phonetically) like this? My question is: What is the common term for "Zeigzigler's Philosophy"? 

From looking at the meaning of deliberately, to do something deliberately would be to do something with intent and reason. Now looking at your three sentences, there is a question of who thinks S ought to do A and how S ought to do A. (1): The one asserting the sentence is claiming that any agent S ought to do A deliberately. Here, S does not necessarily already believe that he/she/it ought to do A deliberately, but rather the assert-er does. There is an additional condition in (1) regarding the manner in which S does A. If S were to do A unintentionally, then S messed up. However, this is interpreting "deliberately speaking" as "with deliberateness." If such is not the case, then "deliberately speaking" refers to the manner in which the assert-er is asserting. The addition then says nothing regarding S or A but is a rhetorical appeal to the methodology in which the assert-er is working. (2): Unlike (1), this sentence does not say anything about the assert-er. We are assuming S's beliefs and what S knows to be true and deducting a normative claim from that set. (3): This sentence differs from (1) and (2) in that it is, prima facie, a nonethical statement. If we equivocate an "instrumentally rational" action with an action that ought to be done, then we can say that (3) is no different than (2). However, this assumes a lot about S and A that we don't know. Let's also look at how "instrumentally rational" could be true, while "ought" would not. Suppose that for S, following every instruction in the Torah is an ethical necessity that ought to be done. Yet, S cannot find any instrumentally rational deduction as to why S ought to live a kosher life. This does presuppose that S does not consider any deduction including a faith-based claim to be rational, but we can easily allow this to occur since (3) does not mandate S to be infallible. 

(I didn't hear what the XXX was - but apparently this has a name). My question is: What is the name of the viewpoint of 'pulling up the ladder of Judeo-Christian morality'? 

Now I'm not making a judgment for or against supernatural claims in this - I'm just trying to understand (a) the assumptions in this observation; and (b) how we reason about such claims. As I understand it we have four general ways of knowing things (epistomology): 

Plato's rejection of the Sophists is reasoned by their rhetoric lacking justice (khairos) - and he says they need to move to 'Maintenance and Restoration'. $URL$ The broader point in this reference was that Plato was the originator of arguing with empathy by better understanding the opponents position first, rather than saying something appropriate to the situation. 

At certain points in history some authoritarian regimes have proposed points of view that opposed individual rationalism. (To give too much detail might invoke Godwin's law - but categorising that behaviour is becoming more important.) An open minded point of view might say this is merely behaviourism. My question is: What is the name of the belief that acting ("the Will") is better than thinking?
