Search example Assuming the four strings , , and , you can replace every string where the same color appears twice (strings 1 and 2) using the search pattern: . The will reference the matching group, matching the whole string only if the color matched in the regex group appears before , too. (Example based on the OOo Wiki Documentation). Replace Example To transform the string to (with regex enabled in the search options), search for the pattern and replace with . 

Enable line numbering for the complete document (Menu "" -> ""; don't forget to enable counting of ""): 

If you put thie field into the header / footer of the page, you'll have a display of the percent completion. This value won't update automatically, but it's no problem to write a one-line macro and define a keybord shortcut. You could even "refactor" that field and define the target value as variable. If you enter the formula above, take care not to insert literally - Word won't accept the formula. Instead, create the formula without in a first step, then edit it and insert the field using the ribbon. Since the word count is available as field also in LibreOffice, i assume a similar solution would be possible there, too, but at a first glance i didn't find a way to define the function. EDIT: A quick and dirty (!) VBA macro may look as follows: 

A common arrangement for appending to files which require privileged access is to use . Its primary purpose, of course, is to write to two places, but you can discard one of them and use the side effect that gives you privileged append. So, something like 

The option says to modify the file "in-place" (i.e. replace the original file with the edited file). On some platforms (notably *BSD, and thus also MacOS) you need an option which can be empty to say you don't want a backup file to be created (or give it something like -i to save the original file as ). It is not hard to combine the two actions into a single regex if you want to make sure they only occur when both conditions are true (though this complicates matters slightly in that you need to understand how to use a back reference); 

Common spell checking utilities include and . Other things being equal, I would recommend the latter; but there are legacy reasons to prefer , and if it's installed on your system already, and is not, it should be fine for English. Maybe also look at which, despite its name, is not just for Hungarian. For the vast majority of the languages of the world which use a (vaguely) alphabetic orthography (and possibly the majority overall), it is vastly better than tools which are based on the limited morphological system of English. 

I have millions of files on a large disk. I want to minimize the average wasted space by correctly formatting the drive. Is there any way to optimize the BlockSize, Sectorsize, and cluster size for a pre-existing disk that has many files? I'm assuming I need to analyze the data I have, format a new disk to spec, and copy the folders over. I'm also assuming that if there are some large files, this will have an impact on the $NTFS internal tracking metadata, increasing their size (as large files consume many segments) 

The only reason I use different browsers is so I can group cookies together, and still have the option for incognito mode as needed. Is there any way I can have a "cookie jar" associated with each cluster of tabs? Is there yet another browser that I can use (I'm on OSX) that will assist me? 

I'm an OSX user and don't like that the scrolling feature moves the entire window on Windows 10. This creates a jarring effect on the entire screen, when I'm dealing with only a particular document. Outlook, with a preview pane, in full screen is an excellent example. IMHO, When I scroll down (or up) excessively, I don't expect the entire app to respond with a shake. Rather, the document (email for example) should respond, or nothing at all. How do I disable the "window shake" when I scroll up / down past the beginning or ending? 

or you can add a conditional to the script to abandon the second action if the first does not succeed. 

I have a text file from a legacy source which contains corrupted characters. At first I thought the corruption was just gobbledygook, but it appears upon closer examination that some of the corrupted text could probably be reconstructed. In order to focus my efforts, it would be helpful to understand what the original looked like, even if I cannot reconstruct it fully. Unfortunately, the document is from a collection which I cannot share freely, but here is a snippet. The message has been converted to UTF-8, but the conversion failed somewhere, so it is mostly illegible. Fragments of text in Czech are visible, where the accented Czech characters have been replaced with Cyrillic characters (which were probably something completely different before the conversion). 

I will concur with the comments to add the user to the group instead to solve this particular problem. 

You were never using or in the first place, and there was some other dead code in your script as well. 

We collect into the array the line numbers of the matches. We then figure out how many of the line numbers in the array are smaller than the middlemost line; their count is assigned to the first partition. (We have to use because we are already past the partitioning point when we out of the loop.) In general, you want to avoid rereading the same file many times, especially if it might be big; and secondly, try to minimize the number of processes. It's not clear what you expect the middle output field to contain. If the file contains an odd number of lines, the first "half" will contain one line less than the second partition. (This is not hard to change, but you have to decide one way or the other.) 

If the certificate is set up properly from a CA perspective, perhaps the web server or the browser isn't building the chain correctly. Make sure the web server has the root and intermediate certificate installed correctly, and in particular some servers (or load balancers) need to have the chain "linked" using a application specific command. Alternatively, know that each browser IE and Firefox (not sure about Chrome) maintains its own CA trust store. You will have to install the root and perhaps thex CA into that respective store. Another tool that you may want to use to compare certificates is the ASN.1 inspector, available here ( $URL$ ) 

I'm using safari, and unsure if this works in other browsers, but when I signed up for a storm path account, I see the following URL 

Here are an example of some SMTP headers that are used internally (in routing) to configure how exchange behaves: 

This presentation allows me to click "yes" or "no" and takes me to a logical path according to my answers. How do I edit the workflow so I can customize it to my needs $URL$ 

You can use , of course, but it is rather unwieldy. Perhaps encapsulate it into a function so you can avoid too many backslashes outside of the actually complex . 

The value is not standardized, but the way I read the spec, any value other than "no" should suppress bounces. I also threw in the option as a fallback; if it works, it could be useful by its own, as many mail servers will not generate bounces for messages which have an empty envelope sender. However, not all sites allow you to control this. 

is executed using and the redirection syntax you are attempting to use is a Bash extension (and a fairly recent one at that; older versions of Bash only supported ). The portable way to append standard output and standard error to a file is 

So, what does it do, and why does the author of this documentation think I think it does something else? This is 7zip 9.04 on Debian Squeeze (i.e. pretty old). 

As an aside, you should not use locking on a forwarding recipe, a trailing wildcard is useless, and the flag is the default; so I took those things out. 

I need my Windows based Outlook users to be able to look up an SMIME certificate from this LDAP directory How can I automatically (via scripting or policy) modify an Outlook profile to include this? 

I am a mac user and am used to quickly using the trackpad after typing. It seems that if any key is pressed, the trackpad is disabled for .5 to 1 seconds. Is there any way I can reduce or eliminate this delay? 

Every SMIME clear signed message has a red icon located near the Urgent exclamation point as shown below. This is often confused with high priority, and sends the wrong subtle message. IMHO a red SMIME icon should only appear for improperly signed messages, not validly signed ones. What Icon DLL can I edit, or registry setting can I use to change this? Outlook 2013 expanded view 

My girlfriend is doing peacekeeping work in Rwanda and she has very poor internet access and it's difficult to stay in touch. What technologies or resources are available for non-connected or remote locations? 

I am noticing a distinct behavior difference between Edge and IE. In Facebook, if I use the trackpad to select "like" I am able to immediately click the "like choice" (opposed to angry, happy, etc). In edge, however, I'm unable to click the like unless I wiggle the mouse. That is annoying. Does this mean that Edge isn't made for Trackpads? 

I have other samples in other languages so getting the Czech sorted out is not really my focus. Here is the beginning of one in, I don't know, probably some Far Eastern language? 

but then you'll need to make sure yourself that the (start, end) pairs in cover all of the space between 0x00000000 and 0xFFFFFFFF if you really want to examine all of it. (And again, notice that the range increments the last byte and that applies the bytes of the value in reverse, in accordance with your stated requirements.) If you wanted to use two different addresses, you quickly run up against the limits of what's feasible to do in your lifetime with brute force; but you could, for example, split the 4-byte number into two 2-byte parts and apply those at different offsets. 

For this simple script, using double quotes instead of single will populate the variables from the parent shell. Of course, if your script contains strings or other expressions which should not be interpolated by the parent shell on the host where you start this script, those need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. But you don't seem to have any of those here. 

I have 10 workstations that had Lync Basic, and 10 workstations that had the full Lync client. Now that I deployed patches, they are both Skype For Business. Is there any difference between the installations? In features or functionality? Below is a picture of a Lync Basic and a Lync full client, each upgraded to Skype For Business. Notice the different product IDs 

I like this javascript based version of a systems thinking diagramming tool. It takes relationships and calculates the values behind it, then animates a dot along the path. So before I get further, I'll post another link to understanding a system here Question 

Is there any way I can get outlook to remind me X minutes prior to every meeting request, and once right when the meeting/appointment happens. 

TLS 1.3 is not enabled by default You can enable this on iOS with this provisioning profile You can enable this on MacOS with this command in Terminal 

I was watching this video and at the 3:30 mark he discusses ITP addresses or TOR addresses. I understand that TOR is an anonymity network, and the fact he mentions ITP followed by TOR makes me want to understand what network he is referring to and what it can do. What is an ITP address? 

This is somewhat obscure, but apparently means and . The package's file listing reveals exactly what it contains. As of right now (version 1.6.6-1) it contains the following files: 

It seems you have to know the old name exactly; there is no wildcard support. It also seems you can only rename a single file at a time. I ended up with the following to rename all the files in an archive: 

Your attempt required there to be a slash before the underscore, but of course, there isn't one in your file, so the regex didn't match anything. You say you want to replace with but several of your attempts look like you also want to remove the underscore before the number. If that is correct, obviously drop it from the replacement string. I speculate your doesn't recognize which would otherwise have been a good attempt. The last one of your tries is so far removed from any valid syntax that I don't think I can comment on it meaningfully. It parses as attempting to use the string as the name of a command, with the arguments and passed to it as parameters.
