We advertised a default originate out of our home location to the remote sites. As long as the carrier is advertising routes, the routes will be preferred from the mpls branches. 

EDIT: As per Ron's comment, if you can't get the licensed IOS from Cisco than you don't have the correct licensing required to upgrade. 

We sat a computer on the switches that were going through heavy broadcast traffic and ran wireshark. What we noticed was a high volume of NetBios traffic and repeated ARP requests where the same host was ARP'ing multiple times for the same target in a matter of minutes. NetBios was supposed to have been disabled on our network; after turning off NetBios services on the endpoints we were able to substantially reduce the amount of Broadcast traffic. NetBios is extremely chatty and continued to reach out for workgroup information before being disabled. 

We've recently installed a POC for Cisco ISE and have confirmed that we are able to log into the switches that poll it for RADIUS information. Since we've moved from TACACS+, we can't seem to find the area of ISE that contains the accounting information for commands entered on the switches/routers that poll ISE. Is there a comparable tool on ISE? Will it require extra commands be entered on the config level? 

I will answer the part of the question that doesn't violate the posting guidelines; "What is a default gateway?" A default gateway in networking is the device that "knows" where to forward traffic to. When your PC makes a request, that request is sent to the default gateway if the request is not bound for the local subnet; that default gateway then "knows" either by being programmed or by some routing protocol where to send your request. The server, or default gateway in your case is most likely a proxy to prevent or log your access of certain web based resources. 

We are currently in the middle of implementing a BYOD policy. Our major opponent is that currently, anyone can hit a site we host publicly and download an cisco VPN software, install it, and with their RSA token + Username/Password use this non-company laptop to access our network. We currently run a Cisco ASA 5510 for our VPN and RSA as our authentication. Is there a way using the Cisco ASA 5510 that we can ahead of time have our users by email register their computers with us (Mac Address, secure certificat, etc. yes I know mac's can be spoofed) and we can enter them into configs to only allow connections from said physical addresses or some other identifier. We can do this via software or ASA configs. Pretty much open to any suggestions at this time. 

The Core layer is responsible for fast transportation across a network. The more intelligent routing you try and perform there the more you slow down the rate of packet flow. You don't want to have a WAN Router also be doing VLAN routing, if you don't have to. You want it receive traffic not bound for the LAN and send it out over the internet or MPLS network. If you had the Core layer do the routing, you'd essentially have all L3 traffic hit it first and be sent back in to the LAN. This is inefficient and causes load on the router that could easily be handled by a layer 3 switch. The distribution layer, however, is where intelligent routing should occur. If I have a group of access switches, each accessing different VLANs, do I want that traffic to have to cross both a distribution switch and then hit a sub interface on the WAN router? No. Shortest, quickest path is from the Host to the Access Switch to the Distribution switch and then to whatever the traffic is bound on the LAN. Additional Reading Not to throw a wrench in the above, but Collapsed Core configurations are becoming more and more common. In a collapsed core configuration, you combine both the Distribution layer and the Core layer into one. You will see this in small enterprises. Your WAN router is still a different device, but instead of having a "dumb" core, you have a core that runs EIGRP, and learns and shares the networks it "knows". Additional Reading 

We recently had an issue where one 3750 switch of a stack crashed due to a slow memory leak. The slow memory leak has been resolved but we'd like to be notified of it by SNMP if it happens in the future. What is the command to enable system crashes to be reported to SNMP? 

The carrier has given me a COS profile of 102: 80/10/10 80% RT for a new 100mb circuit. I've compiled the below as my QoS policy-map and bandwidth configs. 

You have to generate a crypto key AND an allowed IP address for SSH in order to access a firewall via SSH. On routers, you have to create a username and password and create an SSH key. I do not see a crypto-key. What is your IP address? You say you are "behind" 10.109.32.6 but unless you have that address or are part of VLAN12, you will not be able to access the firewall. $URL$ 

Clear Interface resets the hardware logic on the specific interface. It basically resets the controller. If you were looking to clear the configs on a port, default interface will do the job for you. EDIT It does nothing to the configuration of the port. And yes, the GigE's controller for that specific interface is reset. It is not the same as bringing the interface up/down. Bringing the interface up/down only prevents it from taking traffic while is used for interfaces that are not functioning properly to rectify problems with the way the port is handling the traffic. 

We are currently implementing a failover site at a remote location to mitigate problems caused by weather or power outages. CiscoAnyConnect is run from our ASA5510 in Home Office to allow employees to VPN into our network. When we implement the second ASA5510 in the remote location, will we need a second Cisco AnyConnect and Hostcan and Posture module license? Is there a command that we will need to have or setting in place to make sure it fails over properly (other than the normal protocol run between the ASA's)? 

We are running into a situation where we are seeing a large number of broadcasts received on interfaces that are home to servers. I know this is not normal behavior; ARP cache should remember 100 addresses and the switch is set to remember ARP for 4 hours. Below is the amount of broadcasts we are seeing on two particular ports after 2 days.
