I have verified and other side of switch has same configuration. i have matched them word to word. Here is the etherchannel summary 

We have above scenario where currently we have only single link with but soon we are planning to have second link on same BGP router but ISP side it will comes from . I heard its recommended to configure BGP with loopback source but i don't know how does that fit in DUAL router scenario. This is what we have currently configured in my router. 

But if i connect console on bottom SSP-10 module i am getting shell so its good. what is the wrong in and what is ? Here is the picture of LED indication 

Update: Someone suggested run BGP on Internet connectivity but use OSPF for internal routing between Router <---> L3 switch as per above diagram if i plan to configure OSPF between Router and L3 switch then what network i will advertise on OSPF command? Example: ISP provided 10.1.1.0/24 subnet to us how do i configure BGP and OSPF for internal network? Any suggestion? 

We have ASR1006 Router and we are running ACL on it to allow specific port to specific server. Question is there any ACL performance impact on individual IP vs full subnet. like following example. we have 202.100.100.0/24 subnet now i want to use first 200 IPs for web server port 80 remaining 55 (whatever) mail service port 25. Now how do i tell ACL to isolate them or subnet them? Other option i have i create individual ACL for each IP like following but question is does it impact on router performance? 

We are using this switch as and planning to run some ACL to stop bad traffic. I never run ACL on switches so wondering is there any performance impact or how bad it will be? if anyone has any experience or supporting data? More details, we have lots of UDP traffic pretty much streaming so just wanted to mention because small packet size also impact CPU. Does nexus platform use Hardware base ACL or software base ACL? 

Now if I'm right, the metric seen on R2 will be 4. Since we set an inbound metric as 3 and +1 because R1 sent his update with a hopcount of 1. That's fine. Now for example, say I remove the access-list and offset list on R2 and add the following on R1's RIP process. 

Routing tables usually have a default path. Packets that don't meet the longest match for any entry in the routing table are then forwarded through the default route. There also exists Proxy ARP which can help find destinations that aren't in it's local routing table. But definitely the router doesn't forward packets out all interfaces in case it can't find the destination, it just drops the packets, in which case you'd get a destination unreachable or timed out or some error depending on the situation. 

How is 2^11 = 121? Firstly, 2^11 = 2048. The formula for finding the number of valid hosts are (2^n)-2 which is 2046. The 2 being the broadcast address and network address. In the example you've given, 10.0.0.0 is given as the network ID. Since the mask is a 255.255.248.0 one, it means that the hosts jump in terms of 8 hosts, and will have 32 subnets. The broadcast ID of the first network will be 10.0.7.255. So the network ID of the next subnet will be 10.0.8.0, while it's broadcast ID will be 10.0.15.255 and so on. You're not clear with your logic of subnetting. Please watch a few videos on how to subnet. I suggest this one and the rest of their series. 

Both R1 and R2 are running RIPv2 with no auto-summary and R1 has 2 loopback interfaces configured. Now, when we go to R2, by default, the metric to reach the loopbacks of R1 will be 1. Now say we apply the following offset list on R2 

I have nexus switch and i have configured and i want to find out top-talker IP from command line but i am not seeing any command. I have Cisco ASR1k and i have configured and i can see top-talker there with following command Question: does sflow support top-talk like netflow? 

I have this scenario where i have two 10G link from my and both link has two class C public IP which is mentioned in diagram. I want to router data between two VRF & 

In above scenario do i need to specify or open RTP port range on ASA or does ASA will use method when VoIP phone initiate connection to SIP server? How does firewall handle UDP port stat? because in TCP we know its stateful but how does firewall understand its UDP traffic initiated from inside to outside to keep that port open bi-directional traffic? If i enable does that automatically open RTP media port after inspection in ? what if i do not enable in that case do i need to open full RTP port range to allow outside to inside traffic? 

We noticed DDoS attack on our network and we have firewall blocking attack at the same time we notice in it's filling all connection, we have 600k limit. we don't have enabled on this ASA so how to find out who was targeted host? Any method or command which can find DDoS targeted IP or top-talker? 

The Site-to-SiteS with AWS are different :) They only support one security association with Cisco ASA (and maybe other vendors) thatÂ´s why the recommendation is to have only one ACL on the crypto map because if you add another it will with both and it will be dropping the connection between the 2 ACLs. I asked this question in Cisco forum and got answer from there: $URL$ 

You forgot to configure RIP version 2 for R2. You've specified it on R1 and R3, but not R2. Without this, subnet information will not be advertised and hence you cannot use disconnected networks. That's also why R2 is not showing anything on debug mode. 

So now, my doubt is, will R2 receive the update with a metric of 4 or will it receive it with a metric of 5? The reason I ask is because I've learnt that when you apply an offset-list as outbound, it sends the metric as it is configured while when you set it as inbound, it adds the received metric to the offset-list value. Also if we follow the logic that routers increment hop count and then send the update out rather than increment it on receiving an update, this should be correct. But on GNS3 and in a few other places, it says that R2 will receive the update with hop count 5 when by my understanding, it should be 4. Is this a bug in GNS3 or is it how it really works? I'm practicing everything with regard to Cisco 3700 series routers 12.4 IOS version. Any help would be much appreciated! 

Within the same LAN segment? No. Between LAN networks, you can see the same IP address. But within that network, all the IPs have to be unique. So in Site A you've got a LAN with IPs 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255 And in Site B (connected to site A via a router with NAT enabled on it) you've got a LAN with the same IPs - 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255 This is possible. But within the same network, having two hosts both with IP 192.168.1.1 is not possible, it will clash. NAT is mainly so that you can use the same private IPs between sites. Just imagine if for site A we could use 192.168.1.0-255 and for site B we had to use 192.168.2.0-255. And similarly for site C,D,E... you didn't have the option to use 192.168.1 or .2 subnets? That'd lead to a lot of waste in terms of usable IP addresses wouldn't it? Hence, NAT allows same IP ranges to be used between segments. But no you definitely, not with NAT or anything for that matter, have two hosts on the same segment both with the same IP address. It has to be unique. Hope it helped! 

We have VPN tunnel with our customer and they sent their side VPN config and i am trying to put that config in my Cisco ASA 5585 (9.x) version and it has missing command Customer config (remote) 

Solution: This is what i did on radius, map ASA attributes with ldap group. and its working now. /etc/raddb/users 

What i am doing wrong? EDIT: I was following this Doc to setup community RTBH $URL$ Update: I have modify config with following info but still no luck and is default in BGP 

We have Cisco router with fiber transceivers and other end we have does that work to different capability. In short one side and other side fiber port does that work or i should match them? Suggestion: Inside datacenter (short distance) should we go with or 

Does Cisco support Hardware ACL? Because i have read if cisco support hardware ACL then its counter doesn't increase but in my Router its increasing counter but after small delay. is that normal behavior? I have check CEF is enabled by default on Router. 

I download IOS from Cisco TAC and trying to load on ASR1006 but getting following error. I have compared bytes and they are same on cisco TAC. On Cisco TAC they have & but i am not seeing any How do i validate its correct image? 

I have setup ASA5506 for cisco anyconnect VPN and i am able to connect VPN but not able to ping or ssh or anything to any device on remote lan (inside) network 10.0.10.x/24 Here is the network diagram: 

Look like DNS/HTTP isn't working. I have check and NAT is correctly configured. I am suspecting it could be DNS/HTTP inspection policy? but its default i never change it anything.
