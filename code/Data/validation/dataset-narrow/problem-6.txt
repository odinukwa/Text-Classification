It is also worth stating that you can model the whole pipeline in Application Release Automation tools such as BuildMaster or Nolio. Personally, I prefer to build my pipelines from multiple 3rd party SaaS solutions. 

If you have a MSDN or Visual Stuido Online account you can also get £100/$150/€130 per month of credit just because you are a subscriber to one of these services. If you are a startup you may qualify for $120,000 of Azure Credits to host your application through Microsoft's BizSpark programme. Amazon Web Services 

It is my belief that in a cross-functional Agile team following DevOps practices these responsibilities belong to the team as a whole, ultimately being accountable to the Product Owner as the representative of the business. In short, my question is who is... responsible for Environment Management in a team following DevOps practices, i.e., one that does not have an external Environment Manager function available to them. 

Publish Custom Metrics. Create an AutoScaling Launch Configuration. Create an AutoScaling Group and Policies based upon your Custom Metric. 

Practically an organisation could use either solution or if necessary both solution to provide a degree of checks and balances. Are their other architectures or tools that support the management of Free and Open Source dependencies? 

Again where is the - there could be many of them if one commit resulted in many builds. If the state for the build you care about is then you have your answer and you can immediately return the for the commit. Loop over all of the commits from the first phase, if you run out of commits follow the page that is included in the call to . Complete Flow Diagram At a high level the flow will look like this: 

Generally recovering from this sort of mistake involves editing the boot loader to force a root shell. Since you don't have physical access to the (non-physical) machine, things are a bit different. If this is an EBS boot drive, you can try detaching it, fixing it on another machine, then reattaching. This is a good opportunity to learn why it's useful to use configuration management tools for everything: if you were doing this, you could replace the instance in just a few minutes and one command. 

That's only the case if the server you're downloading Python from relies on SNI. I imagine most of their mirrors do not. But really, you shouldn't be compiling Python on every individual server. You should do it once, either on a machine that you freeze into an image that you launch further machines off of, or you package it as an rpm and the machines just download that and install it. This allows you to control the download process. Even simpler: download the package on your desktop (via verified https). Copy it to your file storage. Download from there onto your servers. There's no need to download directly from python.org every time, and it's more reliable to have a local copy anyways. 

Running a job on a specific machine. You can do this with other schedulers, but they're generally designed for tasks that can be run on any one of a set of machines; when you want to do something like run a log rotation on every server in your fleet, that's much easier to set up with cron. Running time-sensitive tasks at exact times. Distributed schedulers will schedule a job to run, but it may not actually run for some period of time, depending on what else is in the queue. Cron doesn't have a queue, and so a task that needs to run every minute will run every minute (or at least as close to that as the OS scheduler will allow). 

This makes it easier to share code across projects, document what has been done so far and handover the code to other or future developers. 

I can think of two architectures that would support the answering of these questions, however, the enormity of the problem could well be clouding my judgement: Approach #1: Walled Garden Effectively firewall off the sources of these open source packages, i.e. npm, Docker Registry, nuget, etc., then create an internal repository of approved packages, implementing some process to whitelist packages. 

As far as I am aware there are no statistical data about the enterprise adoption of each of these frameworks and whether they have adopted DevOps practices in addition to Agile practices, however from experience many organisations appear to gravitate towards Scaled Agile Framework. Kristof Horvath discusses the application of DevOps in these enterprise-grade agile frameworks in his article: Scaling Agile in Large Enterprises: LeSS, DAD or SAFe®?. It is worth noting that adopting an "enterprise-grade" framework is not a requirement in an enterprise, at the end of the day Agile, DevOps and Lean are about adopting the right practices for your organisation, not the most popular ones. 

What can be employed to achieve this in a consistent manner in an organisation that has a large number of development teams, potentially in multiple separate business units? 

Looking through the CloudWatch and CloudFormation UIs I can't actually see any mention of the resulting ARN for a created log group. Question: For any resource within Amazon Web Services how can I obtain the ARN? 

So what is the difference between a sysadmin and an SRE? The year in which they received their title. What is the difference between traditional operations and site reliability engineering? SRE is merely the current incarnation of ops, using new tools (hello, containers!) and, as networked programs continue to become more larger and more important, an increased focus on practices that allow one engineer to do more. 

Any time you're running ad-hoc long-running commands, you should step back and rethink your process, because that should be automated, including error handling. Rather than connecting in to the servers to see status, a better approach is to push that information out. You can do a wide variety of things if your want to write a bunch of custom code, but the simplest thing is probably to start sending the output through syslog to a centralized logging system (syslog itself, or ELK, or whatever). That way you can monitor everything from a central location. Thinking forward, if this isn't a one-off task, monitoring should be automated. That is, you should never have to just watch logs to see if things are progressing as they're supposed to. Instead, you should assume they are (and continue with other work) until your alerting fires off. This is an investment of time into getting reliable and wide-coverage alerting, but as your systems grow in complexity, it will pay off as you don't have to monitor everything any time you change anything. 

To be absolutely clear, these are functions that used to belong to the operations organization and are now owned by the Agile/DevOps organization. There are existing KPIs that drive bad behaviors are: 

Since Google's Site Reliability Engineering Book was released, on more than one occasion I have been told that SRE is an extension of the existing Operations or Application Support model. We've had a couple of questions that defined differences between Sys. Admins, DevOps Engineers and Site Reliability Engineers: 

Because Traffic Manager is a circuit breaker it is capable of detecting an outage in either region and routing traffic to the working region, however there is still a single point of failure in the form of Traffic Manager so the total availability of the "system" cannot be higher than 99.99%. How can the compound availability of the two systems above be calculated and documented for the business, potentially requiring rearchitecting if the business desires a higher service level than the architecture is capable of providing? If you want to annotate the diagrams, I have built them in Lucid Chart and created a multi-use link, bear in mind that anyone can edit this so you might want to create a copy of the pages to annotate. 

Part of adopting the Immutable Infrastructure Pattern is decomposing your system into small manageable pieces that can move through CI/CD Pipeline very quickly, this means that OS patches can be done quickly and in a controlled manner. I often see clients ending up with a halfway house where infrastructure is mostly immutable. However, there are a few approaches to this which I have used in large-scale deployments of cloud architecture, typically I implement more than one as part of a Defense in Depth strategy: 

Since you haven't yet implemented anything, you might reconsider this. Using a system like Ansible vault has a number of security downsides: 

Often in technology we co-opt English words and give them alternate meanings. However, in this case it's really just the standard definition: 

I'd argue that this isn't actually about staging servers. A staging server closely mimics the production environment, and is where a release goes immediately prior to going to production. A feature branch that hasn't been merged into master is not going to be released directly to production, so it should not go on a staging server. If we reframe the question as being about shared development servers, then you'll find more resources as you search. As you've noticed, sharing development resources like this causes a number of problems, so it may perhaps be better to focus on solving the underlying issue instead: why is it hard for everyone involved in this process to run a dev server on their local machine? 

If your goal is actually to have things work, then you need to be honest about failures so you can prevent them in the future. It sounds like the team here is lying (perhaps to themselves, certainly to management) about failures because their goal is to have things appear to be working. These are different things. For instance, take the old joke that QA produces bugs - "my code was fine until QA got ahold of it, and then they made all these bugs!". The bugs were there all along, but the developer was ignorant of them. An operations team's goal should be actual reliability, and they need to be incentivized as such by their management. That means that if they put more monitoring in place that leads to discovering new issues, they should be rewarded, not penalized for the subsequent drop in reliability metrics. 

Approach #2: Audit Allow packages to be downloaded from the internet freely, however, perform source code analysis as part of the build pipeline to report on the packages currently being utilised. 

You only need to compile/test once from the branch; then promote the packages through the Artefact Repository. Your packages are stored forever in an Artefact Repository, for example Sonartype Nexus or JFrog Artifactory, this means you can reproduce an old build as you have the specific packages used for deployment. CodeDeploy will handle the release patterns for you without having to think too much about how to achieve Blue-Green Deployments. 

Yes, I do believe so. To explain that I need to lay some groundwork on how I have implemented something similar, I have simplified the model in an attempt to make it as clear as possible. Assumptions I am making the assumption here that Jenkins, TeamCity or similar is being used as the CI/CD tool of choice. Additionally GitHub is being used and that there is a well-defined and appropriately controlled branching structure: 

Specifically in answer to your 3rd question, if you are willing to look outside of the Jenkins Ecosystem there are alternatives out there that might be of value to you. For my clients who use the Microsoft Stack and have fewer than four teams, I have been recommending the use of AppVeyor it is highly tuned for the .NET Stack and integrated very naturally with and Wix. 

Secondly, it's pretty rare that you actually want to use . Most variables used in Ansible either vary based on the host (and thus should go in / in the project root) or are role-specific (and thus should go in / in the role directory). A few documentation links: 

I'd categorize Site Reliability Engineering as a specialized subset of modern Web Operations. An SRE organization focuses heavily on automating everything, to a degree that is only cost-effective in fairly large companies. Ideas like error budgets can only work when your service has many, many requests, as otherwise you lose granularity (for a smaller service, a particular error could affect 0-20% of your requests, depending on the minute). Related areas like security are absent from the SRE definition because companies large enough to have true SRE teams have dedicated teams for security. The SRE program, as defined by Google, is web ops developed for the specific needs of Google, and not necessarily applicable elsewhere. However, Site Reliability Engineering has been expanding in broader industry use recently. My current job title is an SRE, even though I work at a much smaller company and my job description fits pretty well with John Allspaw's 2012 Etsy web ops definition. My theory is that we've been progressing through titles as a shorthand for espousing the evolution of a single field: 

Fabric (and Capistrano, presumably the unnamed Ruby tool you came across) are a bit unusual in that they're task runners with extra features for easily running tasks on remote hosts. I'm not aware of any other popular tools that do exactly the same thing, but depending on your needs there are a few other options that may work for you. Grunt and Gulp are the foremost task runners in the Javascript ecosystem. While not designed specifically to deploy software, they both have plugin-based systems that allow you do this, and you'll find plenty of articles of people using either one to do so. For instance, this tutorial uses the plugin to integrate ssh with grunt, while this one relies on . Using task runners to deploy code tends to be an approach favored by developers who are wearing an ops hat. When you ask an operations engineer, they're more likely to suggest hacking this behavior into a configuration tool. This can take many forms (for instance, packaging your app into an rpm or deb, then installing it like any other software), but I'm going to focus on what I think would be the simplest and most direct method for you. Ansible is ostensibly a configuration management tool, but it really shines at task orchestration, which I would define as "running a set of actions across a set of servers". The official documentation is a good place to get started, but to give you an idea of what this might look like, you might have a playbook (a YAML file that defines a set of tasks) like this: 

Prevent a deployment from Master overwriting the Hotfix, which could result in an regression. Prevent a Hotfix sitting in the Hotfix branch languishing without being merged in. 

If for example the services as a whole were scaled to support 80,000 requests per seconds and run at about 80% of capacity, a spike in traffic that caused the service to receive 101,000 requests per second would cause 1,000 of those requests to fail. When the retry policies kick in, you end up with additional 1,000+ requests, depending on where the failure was detected which would push the service as a whole up to 102,000 requests per second - from there your service goes into a death spiral doubling the number of failed requests every second. Other than massive over-provisioning of services beyond the projected peak transaction, which would be inefficient. What strategies can you employ to avoid "retry storms"? 

Notes Master is protected as it represents the current state of production, to do this practically you may have another "Release" branch that deployments are made from and only when successful merge into the Master branch. Key Points The Blue Development branch is basically a free-for-all. Hotfix is kind of a free-for-all but any deployments trigger a type of Break Glass by notifying a non-development function who will perform the post-approval and in the process will merge the change into Master. It's essential merges into Master stop while Hotfix is ahead of Master to: 

The mean time to recover has an implied subject - the mean time to recover what? Defining this is key to using the metric effectively. Are you recovering the general availability of your production website? Are you recovering the functionality of a particular feature that has a bug in it? Once you know what you're actually trying to measure, it's much easier to measure it! The general thrust of your question seems to actually be surrounding the competing goals of shipping features and maintaining reliability, which is an ages-old battle. Traditionally it is developers' jobs to implement new things, and sysadmins' jobs to prevent things from breaking, and this leads to departmental conflict, as change tends to cause breakage. One of the philosophies oft associated with DevOps is the idea that developers and ops engineers should work closely together so as to ease this tension. You may also be interested in Google's approach to that problem, which is to have "error budgets" for development teams to spend; once they've penalized stability too much, they must spend the rest of the quarter only working on stability. Along with this, the site reliability engineers have available goals, and if they over shoot, they are encouraged to let more changes through; the idea here is that their goal must not simply be to maintain reliability as high as possible, as then they'd be motivated to fight change in every situation.
