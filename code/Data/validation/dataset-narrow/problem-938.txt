Try to use a very basic formatting of the USB drive, FAT32, formatted under Windows. BIOS/UEFI don't like odd partitions from Linux or Apple, and most other exotic formats. 

Length of USB links is determined from signal loss considerations over reasonably manufacturable cables. These losses are at very high frequency AC signals, where the losses in cable dielectric and cable uniformity matters the most. The DC power delivery is defined from voltage drop considerations, which include a different set of limitations, mostly from DC resistance of a cable, and contact resistance across connectors. USB specifications define allowable voltage drops, but not length. However, cable manufacturers have cost considerations, so it is not economical to make cables that are too thick. As result, the cables are usually made to meet minimal power drop requirements, and one can say that yes, cable power carrying capability (in therms of length) is aligned with the high-speed limitations. 

There are specialized chips (essentially "switchable hubs") that provide this kind of functionality to share a set of USB peripherals between two or more computer hosts. These devices are commercially available, for example: $URL$ Or look for Iogear GUB431 4-Port USB 2.0 Automatic Printer Switch: "IOGEAR's USB 2.0 automatic printer switch allows four PCs and/or Macs to share one printer or multi-function printer. Simply submit a print job and the printer automatically switches to the preferred computer. The switch also enables four computers to easily share one external hard drive, scanner, or any USB device. No more plugging and unplugging between computers." Similar sharing devices are even available for USB3.0 peripherals: $URL$ 

Sound means that your device has sensed VBUS from your port, and asserted "connect" event" - pulled D+ high. This results in connect sound. However, it looks like your device failed to respond to enumeration sequence that must follow the connect event. The investigation depends on whether the port is USB3.0 port, and if the device is USB3 device. If the drive is USB2, failure to enumerate can be caused: (a) failure in digital logic in flash drive: drive fails to respond to USB_RESET signaling, or fails to respond to GET_DESCRIPTOR inquiry. Did you try your flash drive in any other computer? (b) Out-of range termination in the flash drive, such that the host detects false disconnect event; (c) Host port has too much sensitivity in disconnect detector, so with (b) it causes premature disconnect and failure of enumeration. (d) Host failed to provide correct chirp sequence, or chirp amplitude is marginal.. To find the root cause, 

Check if the card is properly inserted into PCI-E slot. Maybe not all contacts have touch... Also check the PCI-E slot for some rubbish, wouch could block contact. If it doesn't help, try the card in different PC. If it isn't detected even there, the card is probably faulty. If it gets detected, you may have problem in your motherboard. 

Yes, there is better method. Use Master session capability of SSH (newer versions). It creates controll session, so you don't have to authenticate for some period of time. It's described here: $URL$ Probably all that you need is to edit/create your .ssh/config. Add there definitions which control the Master sessions: 

First backup your important things from the Windows partition. Then I'd use the gparted from Linux. Backup the recovery partition (with dd) if you want to save it. Unalocated space is fine, it makes no problem. If you are using the swap partition, stop it (swapoff) and remove it from /etc/fstab. Now in gparted delete the linux swap and backup partition. Now you can enlarge your windows partition to new size. The best leave some space for new linux swap in the end of the disk and eventually create new backup partition with the same size and using dd copy the original content there. Create new entry for swap in the /etc/fstab. 

For SSDs there should be some space left because rewrite rate then increases and negatively affects write performance of the disk. The 80% full is safe value probably for all SSD disks, some latest models may work fine even with 90-95% occupied capacity. $URL$ 

You haven't provided any details, like your laptop model, used OS etc. Therefore I can only provide general hints I'd follow in your case: First of all I'd suggest to update OS, GPU drivers and laptop firmware. If it doesn't help, use Google (or your favourite search engine) and search for '"your laptop model" screen blink'. If you find something, apply suggested procedure. If you don't, apply the warranty. 

It depends what you want. If you just want to check for status, then is sufficient. The status usually means, that the service is serving its purpose. If you require more simple test for service activity, you may use: 

If your FTP station has a static IP address or is on the same local network, you could simply set your firewall rules on the rip station to only allow outgoing and incoming port 21 (assuming you are using a non encrypted FTP connection) to the IP address of the FTP server. This will probably be insufficient if you are trying to connect through the internet to a computer with a dynamic IP address, as used by most broadband connections. If it is on the local network it may help to assign the FTP station an IP address manually rather than by DHCP, to eliminate the chance of it changing when more computers are added to the network. 

This page recommends adding blank accellator shortcuts to ~/.config/Terminal/terminalrc'. I run XFCE 4.8 and could not find this file myself. However, in my terminal preferences (under Edit), there is a shortcut tab. Help = F1 is the last shortcut in the list. My terminal emulator version is 0.4.8. Hopefully one of these will be applicable to you. 

Your card is not mentioned specifically, but there is a compatibility table here. It seems different cards can work together in a crossfire setup, provided they are within the same hundred family. For instance any 69xx will work with any other 69xx, but not a 68xx card. Be sure to check that your card is crossfire capable before buying a second one. 

This seems to be a recognized bug with CUPS 1.6.x itself. There is a discussion and workaround for Ubuntu here Hopefully this will be applicable to your situation or at least advance improve your chances of finding a solution. 

It is difficult to tell you anything certain in situations like these, but data packages, phones, mobile broadband modems and other similar devices normally come with a 14 day "cooling off" period, during which you can back out, cancel your contract and get a full refund. It may be worth seeing if your supplier had such an arrangement, and if it does, you could buy and try the services you are interested in. Above all, before you pay any money, make certain that if you're not happy, you can return the device/cancel the contract. I had a similar experience with 3G 4 years ago, and since I was not able to get coverage at my house, I was able to return the device and get a full refund. 

There are hubs which provide Type-C ports. But they are expensive to make, and therefore are non-competitive. The reasons are as follows: 

Why do you want to divide the write time by half? Under your (optimistic) assumptions of Write rate of 30MB/s and 40MB/s for Reads, the answer is simple: in BEST case your application layer will take 25s to read the ENTIRE file, and then 33s to write it back to another drive. So it will take 25+33=58s total, and not a second less. This is the most optimistic estimate under your basic ASSUMPTIONS for data transfer rates. If your application layer has smaller buffer, reads and writes will go in smaller chunks in interleaving manner, so the transfer time will be somewhat longer due to protocol(s) overhead. ADDENDUM: I guess the confusion comes from wrong assumption that each port in the shown card operates as independent channel. It is not. All EHCI controllers are implemented as "root hubs", meaning that each controller has only one list processor (aka DMA), and all HS ports share the same 480Mbps bandwidth. To get reads/writes to go in parallel, one needs to install two cards in system. Or more. 

I don't think you can install a regular XP distribution from a USB stick. From what I recall, standard Win XP image does not have USB drivers installed, so after the BIOS finishes its initial job, the USB drive gets lost, and Windows installation can't proceed. You need to make a special Win XP ISO image to install it from USB, for the ideas see this article. Obviously, the least painful way is to simply buy/borrow an external USB CD/DVD reader. 

However, the adapter of your selection doesn't need any Display Port, nor any Tunderbolt functionality - it is a plain USB 3.0 to VGA converter. You don't need DP support to run your adapter and VGA monitor. But I would strongly advise you to throw away your old VGA screen, and just buy a normal modern LED monitor 22" or 27". Some are under $100 these days. And you won't need any adapter for this. You will save money and waste less power. And preserve your vision. 

I don't believe that HDMI or any other copper cables can help you with 35m distance. But for USB3 speed you can get an optical connection made by Corning Communication. It will be pricey though for a 50m link. EDIT: be aware that the Corning extension can't supply much power, so the device end must be self-powered (have a wall AC-DC adapter). 

Your laptop has chipset Intel HM65 with Socket G2/rPGA988B. According to Intel pages it isn't compatible with your desired Core i7-3632QM. Click on compatible products: $URL$ But be carefull. Your CPU is 35W model so higher 45W CPUs would most probably overheat! 

Check your WiFi router management menu. You should see list of DHCP assigned IPs somewhere. If you're at home, the list won't be long. If you're at work, then you can either ask your admin, who has access to the wifi management or DHCP server (if it's special server). Or you can switch it off, scan your segment for live IPs with 

Yes, dd is the tool you're looking for, if you want to backup all partition. The command is quite simple. The if device is your / partition (probably /dev/sda1), the of is your backup partition on the HDD (in my example /dev/sdb2): 

The faulty state may be: # systemctl is-active myservice inactive # echo $? 3 So you may use it in the test. 

Terminal type or is like superset of . It supports colours. If you want to compare features of terminal types, use utility , like: 

You have 3 options these days. 1) Accept the Z170 (Z370 doesn't provide anything better speaking of SATA ports) 2) Buy additional PCI-E SATA controller (some cheap Axago/Kouwell etc.) 3) Consider AMD Ryzen platform. The X370 (6xSATA + 2xSATA Express + 1xNVME) with AM4. Each SATA Express port functions as either two SATA 3.0 ports or 2 PCI Express Gen3 lanes. So in total, you can have your 10 SATA devices connected. The performance is similar to the Intel offer and AM4 will for sure be able to handle few more generations of AMD Ryzen processors (which isn't usual on the Intel platform...). If I'd buy new PC these days, I'd only consider option 3 as of the future perspective. 

However if you really require and you want to stop it after some time, you may use command. See the example: 

Yes, the memory access will be penalized. If you use different sized RAM modules you'll have just single channel memory access. If you use 2 modules of the same size (and the best parameters too), you'll get dual channel access. If parameters of both modules aren't the same, set settings according to the worse one. 

I have a convertible laptop/tablet with graphics tablet screen, which often logs out of the current X session whilst using GIMP 2.6. I am dropped back to the login prompt without a system wide restart. All unsaved work is lost, making this a real problem for me. This only seems to happen whilst reaching over the keyboard to draw on the screen. I have disabled the CTRLAltBackspace shortcut so I don't believe leaning on the keyboard is causing the problem. There is no output to dmesg or xsession-errors when the restart occurs. Any advice on how to track down or deal with this problem would be appreciated. OS: Linux mint 13, 64 bit (up to date) Hardware: unmodified HP Compaq 2710p, (laptop/wacom graphics tablet), no external devices connected. I have sought an answer at the XFCE forums but with no response after two weeks. 

It seems unlikely. This appears to be the only site currently offering a (partial) view of the inside of the Pixel. The instructions on disassembly have been taken down "temporarily", but until an enthusiast dismantles one this the best chance to find out if the SSD is integrated to the mainboard or is a removable module. There are chips visible in the photograph, which seem likely to be RAM (though I can't find the exact number anywhere online). EDIT: It appears that there is a single flash memory chip just to the left of the USB ports, with a circular white sticker on it. If the SSD is indeed on the motherboard, you would only be able to upgrade with external storage. An MSATA card cannot be used to upgrade because the mini-pcie port that holds the WLAN card is not wired for this. Some discussion, here. 

Your error message suggests a problem, the file you are trying to open is an mp4, not an avi file. If your bink converter cannot open mp4 files, you can either convert your file to .avi with a different tool and then convert it, or you can find a different bink conversion tool. I am not able to provide a recommendation other than to google "bink mp4 conversion". 

This photo makes it clear that the connector is next to the outer casing of the laptop, and so if the HDD were connected in your photograph, the label side would face up, with the connector closer to the bottom of the HDD.
