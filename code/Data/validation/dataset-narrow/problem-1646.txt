I just had some hardtime with a 4.0 dongle myself. The lsusb command wouldn't show my device either despite updating everything. It was strange as dmesg would show it. I ended up taking a new one! Try out another dongle! 

I am now at that point where I activated my dongle (with the hciconfig leadv command) and checked that it is up and running with hciconfig. But when I run an app on my iPhone 4s, to "locate iBeacons", nothing would be shown on my phone. I checked the UUID listened to, it should be correct. Last point I thought about is that if I run a hcitool scan on my RPi, it lists my laptop but not the iPhone, even tho bluetooth is enabled on both devices. I can't tell why, the iPhone should be working just fine since I could pair it to my laptop. If you need more informations (screenshots, exact commands,...), I'll try and provide them. But since I can't think about what might be the issue, I'd rather like to go trough a check list, rather than providing tons of infos not related to my problem. Thank you in advance for your time and help. EDIT : I am adding information about how I am trying to discover my RPi/iBeacon with my iPhone 4S. On the image below, you can see the apps I tried to use and how to configure the ID you are looking for on one : 

It's caused by end line character interpretation. Try instead of if You want proper line break for Windows. Of course it's possible to display properly broken line on Windows - just use alternative software like Notepad++ that handles different line breaking styles. For more information, please see $URL$ 

Yes, there is RTC (Real Time Clock) for this. It's a chip with hardware clock onboard, supported by battery power (it acts as independent power source, just for the clock). See the tutorial showing how to use module with DS1307 chip: $URL$ 

Fan has 3 wires, red and black are for powering it up, yellow is for signal feedback to tell how fast is it going. It could be useful for setting constant speed of fan, but you don't have to connect it anywhere to run a fan. Answering your question if the Pi will be happy... TL;DR: No, it won't be happy at all ...because many things. First, you can calculate how much current it takes, because power equals current times voltage, ie. P=I*V You know the power, you know the voltage and you should know already that I = P/V so your fan draws 1.7/5 = 0.34A = 340mA Now, maximum current per GPIO pin is 16mA, according to $URL$ So it's impossible to run because there isn't enough power available from pure GPIO. Next thing is voltage. Your fan is rated 5V. GPIO outputs 3.3V. So even if you manage to get enough current from your pin, fan won't have enough voltage - should start (it's not guaranteed tho), but won't reach it's RPM. But don't worry, it is possible to connect your fan. Just use NPN transistor like 2N3904, connecting it's base to your GPIO pin through 1Kohm resistor. It's well documented here: $URL$ along with many alternative designs, so I highly recommend visiting this site. I took a sample NPN circuit from there: 

I am working on some audio manipulation with my RPI and have a question on how I should process the signals. Right now I have a USB adapter with an Audio In and an Audio Out. What I would like to do, is have an audio signal come from my phone through the 3.5mm jack into the Audio In, then process the signals coming from the Audio In, then once I am done with my data then send it out through the Audio Output of the USB adapter. In the diagram below, the audio is coming from the phone through the 3.5mm jack (Gray wire) to the Audio Input of the USB adapter. It goes into the RPI and the RPI processes the input, then outputs the raw input value after all the processing is done to the Audio Output port. Question: 

So I am currently trying to set up some peripherals on my RPI3, and I have run into some issues. On my first run through I tried to install the Audio Out via a bluetooth speaker only to find out that my speaker is trashed. I re-installed Raspbian and now I am trying to get Audio In through a USB Microphone and Audio Out through a pair of headphones. The first thing that I tested with the fresh install was the headphones, popped them in switched the sound from HDMI to Analog and it worked like a charm. I plugged in the USB mic and got it to show up on alsamixer but whenever I did arecord test.wav I got thrown an error about it not having an input, I did some magic to the /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf and changed 

Sorry, but it's not possible. Maybe future HDMI standards could implement this, but not now. I guess we'll start using USB-C sooner. As for the Intel Compute Stick, if You see the images explaining external ports, You'll clearly see that there is a Power port (micro USB) as well. 

Try this and let us know did it work :) More info on PHP curl function is available on manual page $URL$ 

You still have to provide some wifi credentials so if I were you I'd buy a router and create my own local network with ethernet connection to pi and wifi connection to your computer. You can then see (from router admin panel) which IP address was assigned to your Raspberry Pi and connect to it via ssh. 

Check your power adapter, try another one. I use bulky ones that are dedicated to tablets. Your USB disk might draw too much energy, so maybe try using powered hub If not, it might be caused by the voltage drop in the electrical grid inside your building (maybe switching on electric cooker or kettle, AC, some kind of engine?) - the drop might be long and deep enough to cause Pi to freeze. If you have UPS, try connecting your power supply to it. You might also check if your system is okay. Try another SD card with freshly installed OS. This could also be caused by some damage to your Pi or the external disk that causes some kind of short circut (cold solder joint / dry solder joint). Change them and check if the problem is gone. 

On that second picture, you can see how I entered an UUID. Since this particular app (talking about "Locate iBeacons") seems to give the ability to turn a phone into a transmitter, I tried with an iPhone 5 and my iPhone 4S to make one as transmitter and the other one was listening. Same UUID, major, minor and power values : couldn't "detect" the transmitter with any of these apps. I tried to listen to my RPi/iBeacon with these 3 apps, using 2 different UUIDs on each (which means, I did 6 tests, not counting my tries with the iPhone 5 and 4S). I am going to try and sniff some bluetooth trafic in the next days (I know someone having a bluetooth analyzer). But if you think about something else, thank you for sharing! 

I am struggling to make it happen : I'd like to turn my RPi into an iBeacon (as there are quite a few tutorials out). I first had a faulty dongle, which I changed. Still it doesn't work right yet. As I am more like an amateur, I seek for help. what I got working so far is (referring to the common steps described in the various tutorials): 

Read first I thought I would give a little edit to my initial question just to add what was the big deal in short! What I wrote at first stays untouched below (the line). I was having trouble to discover (by either monitoring or ranging it) my Raspberry Pi set to broadcast just like an iBeacon. I tried to use as many Apps as I could (on an iPhone 4S) and the issue here was that I didn't enable location services!! 

Provide full path to both PHP file and PHP binary, eg. . You might need root privileges as well. Safer option might be calling your local server via curl, like this: 

You just connect your fan instead of load and use one of the 5V pins (not the GPIO!). Keep in mind that your power supply should be capable of delivering enough energy to keep both Pi and your fan powered at the same time, so don't connect electric heater there ;) 

GPIO input I'd suggest using Opto-isolator to avoid unknown voltage going directly to GPIO. Additional explanation is available on many blogs on the internet, for example $URL$ 

So they advertise it as plug-and-play because they might be powered only by USB sockets from the TV. But apparently not many TV's provide sufficient current to power up anything bigger than USB flash drive. And just a few words regarding MHL adapter. I actually own one of them and they have to be externally powered as well. 

Maybe you should try cross-compiler like VisualGDB ? It provides nice GUI integrated with VS. There are sample tutorials for that plugin as well as community on their forum. You have to pay license after 30-day trial, but for me it's worth it if you are familiar Visual Studio and plan to program your Pi remotely. 

First of all, check if it's AC or DC in there. If it's AC, you should make it DC using sample diode bridge or you might have unexpected behaviours or even burn some components. If you have DC, you can divide the problem into 2 parts. Voltage detection part I'd go for sample comparator. You can use this calculator to get exact values of resistors you have to provide, so it would switch properly. 

I currently have a setup on my RPI using a USB adapter which has an Audio Input and an Audio Output. Currently I am using the Audio Input information to control GPIO pins on the RPI. I am taking in the frequencies and processing them. What I am trying to do, is have the Audio Input immediately go out through the Audio Output of the same USB dongle? How would I set up a script/service so that any audio input going in on the USB adapter, immediately goes to Audio Out on the USB adapter. If this isn't possible, would it be better to have a headphone splitter before the source audio ever gets to the RPI and just use the splitter as my Audio output? My goal is to have the audio coming into the pink port from a 3.5mm jack, be the same as the one that is exiting the green port as a 3.5mm jack. Thank you! 

After I did this it seems to work when I record Audio as the file size looks to be of decent size when using USB microphone but it isn't playing back VIA Analog or HDMI (I also tested to see any sound VIA youtube video). What I think is happening is that I set USB as Audio IN and OUT whereas I only want it as in. TL;DR Is there a way to have Audio Input as a USB Microphone and Audio Output through 3.5 Jack/HDMI Thank you!
