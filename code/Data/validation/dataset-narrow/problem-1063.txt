So, if the OS reports that it has detected a 64 bit processor, then it will be working in 64 bit mode. 

You apparently checked both of your sticks of Ram in the one working slot, and the laptop started and worked with 2gb each time you did this. Just so you understand me, I'm saying that you put one stick of Ram in the good slot, turned the notebook on, saw that it worked fine... then you removed that stick of Ram, put the other stick in the same slot, turned the notebook on and saw that it Ran fine. That IS what you did, right? Because if you did not follow that procedure, then we don't know what is wrong with your computer yet... and we won't know until you actually do that. 

The problem isn't so much the actual downloading. It's the session handlers. So, just side step them. Are you talking about getting videos off YouTube? Use the Chrome extension for downloading video from Youtube and saving as FLV. There's also an extension for just downloading FLV video, but it's made for developers builds of Chrome. And... here's a flash video downloader for Chrome... hosted on Cnet. So, there are options. Not so much changing the behavior of Chrome, but more about changing your behavior... in what you do when you find a video you want to watch. 

Actually that's not exactly true... that just because it will install on WinXP, it should install on Windows Server 2003. For example... Vegas 10 isn't compatible with XP 64. 

This thread at the Oracle forums explains your situation quite well, in that it deals with someone else who shares your confusion. I'll quote a few of the relevant points, but you should read through the thread. 

You don't need to install third party software. Everything you need to transfer files and folders between your computers is already included. Now, if you meant something ELSE by your use of the phrase "transfer data" you will need to detail that. 

If you are talking about Cable Internet, all you need to do is first verify that your cable company will allow you to use your own modem, and then if they do... once you purchase your own modem you supply them with the MAC address of the device. This will allow their equipment to recognize and communicate with the modem you purchased. This explains why the cable technician can walk in to your home after you place a service call, and swap out a faulty modem with any working ones that he has on the truck. He just calls in the numbers on the modem, and a technician at the cable company replaces the old information with this new stuff. Think about it this way. Unless it is a combination cable modem/router, there is no administration panel or user configurable settings you can get into in the modem. If you are talking about DSL or ADSL, that's different. Specific connection based information has to be entered into the modem. DSL modems actually come with router firmware built into them, and it is typically hard coded to only pass out ONE internal IP address. So, it is possible to purchase your own DSL modem, or even replace the firmware on some of the ones given out by the telephone companies, but the modem has to be configured specifically for the ISP that you are connecting to. If you have ever connected a router to a cable modem, and examined the connection details from the router admin panel, you can see the external IP address... the one given to you by the ISP. If you have ever connected a router to a DSL modem and examined the connection details from the router admin panel, you will see you are getting an IP address like 192.168.2.1 from the DSL modem. 

The default port that the Windows Remote Desktop Client uses is 3389. So, first, when you attempt to connect, add that port to the IP address. 192.168.x.x:3389 As has been mentioned, make sure the Windows Firewall is set to allow RDC connections and/or connections on port 3389. Check to ensure there is no firewall installed on the Mac that is blocking activity on 3389. Check your router as well. Feel free to forward all traffic on port 3389 to the specific IP address of the Windows PC. Go that extra step and assign a static internal IP address to the Windows PC MAC address in the reserved DHCP table. 

If you don't want to spend a dime, then your best bet would be to customize your CentOS build to include a VNC server, and to run that server during the installation process and every time the computer is run. This wouldn't be the easiest method, but it would mean that once the installation had a network connection established, you could connect to the computer with your laptop using a VNC viewer. If you have any friends, you can borrow a mouse and keyboard to perform the initial CentOS installation, and then use the same basic instructions I gave you a link to, to install and setup VNC, and then return the keyboard and mouse to your friend. Then, you need only connect via a VNC viewer from your laptop. If you want to head to your nearest Salvation Army or Goodwill store, you could purchase a keyboard and a mouse for less than $10 USD, and then use them to install and set up CentOS. You can still install VNC, and put the keyboard and mouse away for future use. Personally, I recommend getting the keyboard and mouse, and having them should anything go wrong in the future. But, if you insist on not getting them, then the first option, customizing your installation media, would have to be the way to go. EDIT you could also just perform an Unattended Install of CentOS. You would have to find instructions that fit your tastes, and follow them. In most cases, they would involve a little tailoring, but otherwise you would create the install media, connect the install media, start the computer, and stand back. Like... $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ or just do a search for "unattended CentOS installation" and/or Kickstart. 

Sure. Get or use a router that is compatible with DD-WRT firmware. It would be used to replace the firmware on your router. It enables you to use QoS to limit individual computers to just a percentage of the total bandwidth. 

...or just use AllowProperties to disable access to changing the settings. TightVNC... no mention there of controlling access to the clipboard. I notice this setting is conspicuously absent in UltraVNC as well. Don't know about LogMeIn... so I'll set up an account and see... and done. File sharing is easy... and not something you appear to be able to disable. No mention in the settings at all about the clipboard.... But... whatever you copy in the remote session can be pasted into the local session. And oddly enough, following their instructions to share a file ( a text file called new.txt sitting on the desktop of the remote computer) fails. I am given the error that I cannot share that file and if it is on a network resource I need to copy it to the actual machine. I'll have to investigate that. Mikogo isn't remote desktop sharing. It's presentation. The person who connects (and is not the presenter) can view whatever is opened on the desktop. They can't open new files, etc. They can't select what is shown. When they are changed to being the presenter, the desktop view is switched to see THEIR desktop. So... when using Mikogo, you are either viewing what someone wants to show you on their computer, or you are showing yours. So... it looks like using the advanced settings in VNC to alter what parameters can be changed/turned on and possibly even hiding the VNC icon is the way to go. 

The beauty of laptop optical drives, is that aside from the tray panel and how it attaches to the tray, the rest of the drive is universal. Your laptop uses a standard optical drive, and it could make use of a true universal replacement slim drive (the kind where the drive "door" is no wider/taller than the dimensions of the drive). So, yes... any number of the ones I found on Amazon will work in your laptop. Several at Amazon. Note, I'm not talking about a 9.5mm Ultra slim drive... I'm talking about a standard 12.7mm slim drive. Your laptop doesn't use an Ultra Slim drive. 

First, depending on how you installed Folding@home, and what video card you have in the system, your GPU might have been used to carry the majority of the load... as opposed to your CPU. Games can tax a processor, yes... but games require good video chipsets, and are made to tax them as opposed to the CPU. Second, there are much better CPU benching tools out there... tools that have been designed to make your processor work, and to benchmark your CPU. Prime95 (32bit version and 64bit version) is an example. It cranks up your CPU to calculate prime numbers, and it will make every core and thread of your processor work really hard. Now. Note where those files are being downloaded from. An Overclocking site. That means you can get OTHER tools to stress your CPU at the same site. Why? Because it is a site that is geared toward overclocking, and helping you do it right and learn what you need to know. There are MANY such sites out there, and the curtain can be pulled away to reveal them by simply searching Google for 'overclocking'. Third, no. The radiator should not be cool. If you need evidence, go put your hand on your car's radiator while the engine is on. As to your specific temperatures... check the watercooling block mount and make sure it is sitting on your processor correctly. You'd like to drop those temps down by about 20 degrees C. EDIT I must have missed the part of your question where you wanted to rate your system for comparison purposes. You could use tools like 3DMark06 for that. It performs a series of different tests, and produces a number at the end that you can then use to compare against other systems (they have a big list) to know where you rate. Sad to note that if I wanted votes, I should have ignored your actual questions and just addressed a single point.. and told you it was bad and not provided any solutions. I forgot that helping people doesn't rate well here at SU. Ah well... my loss is your gain sir. 

You can install BartPE to boot from a USB stick, but this is not what you want. BartPE is a Preinstallation environment, and you must have all the software you want to use already set up within BartPE beforehand. It isn't like a regular OS... it is a LiveCD environment. You can install XP to run from an external USB hard drive, which means you can install it to run from a USB flash drive. The instructions are detailed and quite complex. This is an EHow article on it. Some people simply connected the external USB device to the computer, booted to the XP installation disc, and their external drive was detected by the XP installation setup as a viable device to install to. They installed to that external device, and everything worked out hunky dory. Have you tried this?
