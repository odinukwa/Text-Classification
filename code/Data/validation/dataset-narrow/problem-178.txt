Have you tried simply plugging it in? Many, even most, (but not all) gigabit ports will negotiate down there. If the one you have won't, buy a small switch that will (look for specs like 10/100/1000 for the port speeds), and put it between slow old device and the rest of the network. Alternatively, put a new(er) network card in the device. 

Well, you have the "test/book answer" and you have real life. In real life, you try it if you want to know the real answer, since modeling the actual effect of walls, floors, etc is still somewhat substandard (or would require more effort to get an accurate model than going and checking in real life takes.) This is a "wireless site survey" and without one you are flying blind. "Free space path" only applies if the path is in free space, which is exceedingly rare except for outdoor WiFi serving playing fields or the like. It does not account for the floor/ceiling you must have if the question is about 2 floors. Most commercial building floor structures (such as concrete over steel sheets) are exceedingly hostile to WiFi propagation. If there are any walls on the those floors, (ie, it's not just a warehouse like space) the answer changes again. 

It's not terribly difficult to train yourself, if you care about the doing. If you care about selling yourself more, BICSI will happily take your money as a certifier. Probably better if you can get your employer to have you certified as continuing education so BICSI can take their money, but if it's not applicable enough to your job, it's not. When I was teaching myself (for work, but the budget was low) I managed to attend a quasi-local fiber optic conference which had lots of BICSI training classes as part of the offerings (but attendees could attend regardless of affiliation - BICSI members would get their cards stamped [or equivalent] to prove they had kept up with training classes.) I've also done some online training webinars under the same circumstances. As someone new to fiber optics who had actually read and understood the basic background information, I found that there was very little new content to most of these training sessions (and many of them were not-so-subtle sales pitches for some company's product, yet they were an approved training class.) I remain unaffiliated with BICSI, but I built a fiber optic network that has been running for 6 years now with few problems, and at a very attractive price for my employer. But I don't have any certificate for that... By the way, if you are talking about "custom length patch cables" rather than fiber in walls or between buildings, I can save you the bother - the industry-wide recommendation is to order those factory made, it's almost always a better cable that's more cost effective. Concentrate on remembering to inspect and clean before every connection, and put your initial educational effort there. 

While this is true on the fiber side of the system, and SHOULD be true on the thing with the transceiver socket (SFP, typically, for current Gigabit stuff) it is evidently not always true for certain annoying manufacturers that like to lock you into their house-brand transceivers at far above the cost of standard/generic/standards-compliant transceivers. One of many reasons I avoid certain brands by default. 

Because "business class" implies use in many situations where the service may be supplied by something other than ADSL. Combined router/modems are pretty much a home/consumer niche device. 

It rather depends on what is real. 24V 6.5W is not 24V 0.5 A - but I think the latter number is just what the default (passive) POE power brick is, and they are oversized somewhat by default. 24V 0.5A would be 12W. 24 of those would be 288W and require the 500W switch. 6.5W X 24 ports would be 156W and the 250W would be fine. 

If you have OM2 in the walls, it makes no difference, and if you have a mixture of OM2/3/4 in the walls, it's probably a good idea to use (only) patch cords that match the highest grade fiber in the walls, as they won't hurt the lower grade runs, though it does run a risk of making the uninformed think that all the cables in the wall are OM4 when they are not. But the uninformed are rather hard to sort out in any case. If you have OM3/4 in the walls, it's not a good idea, though it may "work" for some value of "work." But it's a terrible place to "save" a few bucks while wasting/degrading a few kilobucks of installed fiber plant. 

Singlemode fiber often costs less than multimode fiber. When building a 1Gb fiber network that I wanted to be able to go to 10Gb or faster on eventually, I found that the savings on cost of fiber (about half-price) for singlemode .vs. OM3 or OM4 multimode more than covered the (35% or so with adequate shopping) increase in cost for (brand-new) SFPs at that time - and did not limit my link lengths as OM3 or OM4 did. Nor is it limited to 10Gb. I also gained a huge loss budget, since a singlemode LX set is designed to go 10Km (but also works fine at 5m.) Conventional wisdom has not caught up with that particular reality. If you are willing to look at used ex-fiberchannel SFPs (I was, but I didn't use them in the economic justification phase), the price of singlemode 1Gbe drops through the floor. My preference is to ONLY use singlemode (and, inside buildings, 5e copper) at this point in time. I'll be doing a 25m singlemode fiber sometime soon, becasue it's a between-buildings connection, and I have been eliminating copper between building connections and having a lot less trouble with thunderstorms as a direct result of that. Under different constraints, I would probably consider using OM3/4 multimode for short, easily replaced runs inside buildings or within a server room; under the actual constraints I have to operate in (low budget) 10Gbe is still some time in the future - but I can go there on the cabling I have, when I can afford to. In my opinion, any multimode fiber should be considered as a short-term purchase with the progression of data rates. Just ask anyone with a 62.5 multimode plant (100Mbit, 2Km, IIRC) in place - the singlemode that could have been installed at the same time still works at today's data rates. OM1 is obsolete. OM2 is obsolete. OM3 is darn near obsolete. If you have budget for and need for 10Gb short connections, fiber appears preferable to 10Gb copper, and the economics at last check still supported multimode. Keep an eye on those economics though, as history suggests that the price premium for singlemode will drop.
