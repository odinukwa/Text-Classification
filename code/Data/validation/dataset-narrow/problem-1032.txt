The Send Page by Email Firefox extension seems to only send X bytes of a web page. Or some portion. UPDATE: I was incorrect. The limitation is that sendemail.exe (which the extension uses to send the email has a 16k limit on the body text passed in.) Where I don't have Firefox, I can only send the link, so no full text search at all in those cases. 

I'm creating port forwarding rules on my DD-WRT router (shown below) and want to allow all (any) source networks access. My thought was to specify 0.0.0.0/32 but that is not working. How do I specify this? 

I'm using Outlook 2007 with IMAP. I've configured sent messages to be put in the server-based "Sent" folder of my IMAP account. When I send emails, the email will briefly appear in the Sent messages folder and then disappear. They might appear for just a few seconds up to an hour or so. By "disappear" I mean that the messages are no longer in the list, and doing a search across all folders (I created a Search Folder to search for all messages) the message does not come up at all. I had a number of rules but I disabled them all and the problem still occurs. In addition I disabled AutoArchiving and ensured that there were no filters on the Sent folder. 

Is there a way to prime Outlook's local address cache with names/email addresses from the local address book? It's a real hassle when, for example, you move a user from another email client to Outlook and they have to either type in or look up the recipient's name the first time they email that person. It's so time consuming. Update: Is the process different for Exchange mailboxes vs. IMAP? 

Looking at Amazon reviews for OCZ Agility and Vertex SSD drives, I often see an equal number of great reviews and lousy reviews. People either seem to love them and have no issues or have tons of problems. Reviews for Corsair and Sandisk drives generally seem good to great. What's the story with OCZ? 

I'd like to display an RSS feed (updating dynamically of course) on my Windows 7 desktop. The posts I've read about Windows 7 RSS backgrounds are all about displaying various background images delivered via RSS. What I'm looking for would be similar to the Windows XP/95 Active Desktop feature which allowed for web pages to be presented on the desktop background. 

Instapaper looks interesting because it does page clean-up, but it's not clear to me that it actually stores the page content or is full text searchable. In addition, they state in their FAQ that their storage isn't mean to be long term. Thoughts on addressing the gaps and improving this process further? 

I want to create new Chrome windows (no tabs) from outside of Chrome, e.g. by running Chrome.exe multiple times. How can I do this so as to get a single Chrome window? The default result is to create new tabs in the existing window which requires me to drag and drop the tag to create a new window. 

Under the above conditions, I clocked under 2 hours of battery life across 3 tests (1:49, 1:52, 1:47). If I actually use the computer, we're looking at 1:30. Something is not right... 

I want to remove the folder, so I read How to Remove RSS Support from Outlook and discovered the MFCMapi gem of a utility. I followed the instructions in the section "Delete the RSS folder using MFCMAPI" section, and was able to remove the folder from Outlook. However, the "RSS Feeds" folder now shows in the "Deleted Items" folder in Outlook Web Access (OWA) and also on my mobile devices, but not in Outlook. In OWA I attempted a right-click and delete, but I am told that folder cannot be deleted. I poked around my OST file (I am running in cached exchange mode) using again using MFCMapi to see if I could find the folder but I do not see it. Finally I created a new Outlook profile in which I do not cache messages, so I could get a "live" look at the server and attempt to see the folder and delete it that way, but it still did not show. Any ideas? 

There's a tool called ReliefJet Essentials which does this. The feature is called "Disable or Enable Warnings" and is at $URL$ 

What happens is this: if, prior to activating the hotkey there is any arbitrary window in focus, the browser instance launches in the background which is not what I want. If however the desktop or Taskbar has focus then my new Chrome window comes to the forefront as I want it to. 

So far though I'm unable to find a spider that can handle #1 and #2. * The site is a bill payment service and it has my bill history. I'm looking to stop using the service but I want to keep the history. 

I have a new ThinkPad W500 laptop (w/ 9 cell battery) running Windows 7 RTM 64-bit. All drivers* and BIOS are the latest. Battery life appeared poor so I performed several tests under the following conditions: 

I'm looking to simultaneously send the same email to multiple recipients. Let's say I want to email John and Bill the same email, I want them to be in the "To:" field, but I don't want them to see each other in the address list. I don't want to bcc them both because then they see they are bcc'd. I want them to each get their own copy of the identical email and to have 2 emails in my sent folder - one for each of them. Essentially I want the same result as if I separately sent them each the identical email, but I'd like to do it in fewer steps. Can I accomplish this either natively or with a plug-in, or some pre-existing code? NOTE: I am looking to do this interactively (in real time), not in batch. 

This might work as-is with no firewall changes (except perhaps permitting http and https Internet access for the static IP addresses of the machines running LogMeIn). Firewalls that are configured securely do not permit inbound connections that originate from outside the firewall. The way LogMeIn works is that the LogMeIn client that's installed on the internal PCs initate an outbound connection to the LogMeIn servers (the broker) over https. Given that it's https (or http) this traffic is indistinguishable from normal web browsing. When the external user goes to the LogMeIn web site to connect to an internal PC, the external user rides the https connection that was initiated by the inside client. Since the inside client initiated the connection, all is good. Like I said above, you may need to have your firewall person add the addresses of the inside PCs to the firewall, but again it's all over https and looks like web traffic. Prior to any changes I'd test from a PC that already has Internet access and see what you get. Update: This support article on the LogMeIn web site seems to confirm the above. $URL$ It does make a good point that if there's a firewall (Windows firewall or other) on the internal PCs you may need to grant access to the LogMeIn executables, however this is unrelated to the network firewall piece. Hope this helps. 

If the power adapter is relatively new... and I mean a week or two old... then it can be expected to still produce that odd, "electronic" smell. If you have had the power adapter for months or years, it should not produce that smell any more. If it starts to do it again after all this time, something has changed... and it is rarely due to a good reason. I personally can't think of anything good that would cause it to smell as if it was burning, but I'm just covering all the bases there. So, an audible from a device not designed to produce any sound, and an olfactory from a device that shouldn't produce a smell. Chances are, you will need a new power adapter soon... if not now. Will using it damage the laptop? I'm not advising you to ever use that power adapter again, because I'm covering all the bases. Chances are that you could use it right up until it dies and nothing bad would happen to your laptop, simply because of the way that DC adapters are designed. DC adapters are designed that when they fail, they don't necessarily surge. Again, there are always exceptions and unique situations. My advice is to replace the power adapter. 

This would depend entirely on the dedicated video card you put in the system, but in general, no. A dedicated video card would generate MORE heat, as it would be a more powerful GPU and it would work harder to provide a better display. Now "most work load is shifted to it"... not accurate. First, are we talking about the newest generation of Intel and AMD processors that have GPUs built into the actual CPUS? Or are we talking about older systems where there is a GPU integrated into the design of the motherboard? Because for the purpose of what you are talking about, these are apples and oranges. In the systems where the CPU and GPU are separate, but the GPU is part of the motherboard, there is STILL a separate GPU that is generating it's own heat, and doing it's own work. There is empirical evidence to suggest that in an integrated system like that the CPU will work harder overall, but no actual benchmark testing results have been published to prove this. So, you have a weaker, smaller Integrated GPU producing heat on one hand, and you have the larger more powerful dedicated video card producing heat on the other. Think of it this way. On systems with an Integrated GPU, you may see a heat sink on it, but you rarely see a fan on that heat sink. Regarding video cards, you rarely see video cards without fans today. Why? They generate a ton of heat. 

In general, switching over from Windows to Linux often poses a very specific problem; namely that of processor throttling. Relatively modern computers, regardless of whether they use an Intel processor or an AMD processors, tend to have processor related drivers installed that will throttle the processor when there isn't a demand. That means at idle or when you are performing light tasks (and you are using Windows with all the proper drivers installed) the CPU will actually run at a slower speed... thus generating less heat. You don't see this with Linux in general, because by default you won't have any drivers like that installed... depending on which kernel is being used. It wasn't until 2011 and kernel version 2.6.18 that AMD's Cool and Quiet was able to be used (using the powernow-k8 driver). So this is one potential issue. Your CPU might be a relatively modern one, running at full speed all the time generating more heat than it would normally. As to the first two points I mentioned, if the laptop is more than a year old, and it is used in an average home environment, you could be looking at dust blocking the heat sink fins. Like this... 

That's from this Microsoft Article Now, if you'd rather convert the AVI to a GIF file to make embedding it easier, you can use an online converter like Zamzar. 

Well, according to THIS documentation that describes how to interpret the three LED indicators that you find on a ThinkCentre power supply, the only scenario that shows the Yellow one being on results in needing to replace the power supply. Just curious... if you remove all the cables from the power supply... meaning that you disconnect the cable that connects the power supply to the wall... how do you get powered LEDs? When you said that, did you mean that when you disconnect the power supply from the motherboard? If so, that's not an indication that the power supply is good. The Caution indicator (amber) could kick on when there is a load on the power supply. 

Computer 1 has hard drive issues. Computer 2 had motherboard issues. You took the hard drive from computer 2, and tried to use it in computer 1. You used third party software to erase the hard drive and create, as you say... 

It couldn't be the screen inverter. All that does is provide high AC voltage to the Cold Cathode Fluorescent Light that illuminates most LCD screens. When there is trouble with the inverter, you just have a dark screen. It would never cause the issues you are seeing there, because it in no way connects to the screen in a way that could cause that. Corrupt Video Ram could look like that, but typically is expressed over the whole screen. Yes, there are examples of GPU issues that can be selective... but in general you'd see the issue from the BIOS On. In fact, Video Ram issues will persist even when not using your display. Connect an external monitor, and see if you can see those lines. You can even see corrupt Video Ram issues over a remote VNC connection. 

Mozilla Bug Report. Which tells you that not only is Mozilla aware of it, but they've known about it for a while. Oh, and I know that seems to be a more generic bug report, but this one here is more recent, and more specific to your issue, and is tagged as a duplicate of the first I linked you to. That said, there is code to disable some (most?) Youtube keyboard shortcuts... but it must be added to the embedded tags when the video is put in the web page.
