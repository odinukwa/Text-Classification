You may be able to retrieve some of the remaining ~70% with data recovery tools but if your friend thinks he stands a chance of remembering the password then another approach would be to complete the encryption process. If he remembers the password then he gets 100% of his data. If he can't, he gets 0%. According to the TrueCrypt documentation an interrupted system encryption can be resumed. That should (hopefully) also apply to non-system drives providing that the filesystem is NTFS and you're using TrueCrypt 6.1 or later and Windows Vista or Windows 7. I'm inferring this from the FAQ: Can I encrypt a partition/drive without losing the data currently stored on it? Be aware that any data recovery attempt on the drive prior to completing the encryption may overwrite some of the already encrypted data and render it unmountable/corrupted even if you do manage to complete the encryption process. Best of luck. 

As long as you have the two times entered in cells as proper Excel datetimes then you can simply subtract the starting datetime from the ending datetime. If starting time is in cell A1 and ending time is in cell B1 then you can calculate difference in C1 with: 

I don't know the best way to use VB to solve that but you can solve it directly in the spreadsheet using the array formula: 

Sometimes USB ports on laptops don't have sufficient power to drive an external USB HDD. Try connecting it to a PC instead of the laptop or get a dual input USB power cable which plugs in to two USB ports on your laptop (data/power + power only). 

Although SVG doesn't meet all your requirements it is still the best choice because it is widely supported and there exist lightweight (compared with Illustrator) programs such as Inkscape which allow easy vector editing and support exporting to bitmap (PNG, JPEG, etc.) for use where SVG is not supported natively. There are other vector formats but none of them enjoy the wide, cross-platform and continually expanding support that SVG has. 

You need to increase the range given to to include all the columns containing data that you want to reference. In this case the range needs to include column 8, so it should be $A$5:$H$7 or wider. 

Looking at your ZIP file tells the story. good.jpg and bad.jpg are the same file size but bad.jpg compresses from 1.84MB down to 1.03MB whereas good.jgp is almost uncompressable. This indicates that a large portion of bad.jpg has been overwritten with other data that is easily compressible. So a large portion of the image data (DCT coefficients quantised and then compressed) is completely unrecoverable, even if you could reconstruct the header information. 

Excel datetimes are stored internally as numbers where 1.0 represents one day and 1/24 represents one hour and so on. There are 86400 seconds in a day so the duration in seconds is: 

Photoshop uses various pen tools to create vector paths which you can use to apply stroke and/or fill as pixels on the current layer. Go to Photoshop CS4's help and check out the Drawing section for a full description. 

Returns if Sheet2 exists otherwise . If your sheet name is in another cell, such as , you could use: 

You can use the Library module's Survey mode. It is primarily for viewing several images at once but you can use it with just one image selected and it will zoom to fit, even above native resolution. From the Library module, select an image and press N or otherwise use the menus: View -> Survey. 

Use with no quotes around the 4 if you want it to test for the value 4, not the string "4". Excel will often convert between string and numeric representations but it didn't appear to in this case when I tested in Excel 2010. If I put '4 (apostrophe to force string) then your original formula returns X as you expected. 

The default Normal style includes the General number format. You can right-click on the Normal style on the ribbon and then select and remove the Number formatting from the style. 

ImageMagick's utility (command line) will show you all sorts of info about images in a range of formats. 

The other answers provided so far suggest you reorganise your data to a format better suited to Excel's inbuilt functions and there are good reasons for doing so, but if you really must have your data in a comma-separated text string then the following will work: 

Pivot tables and pivot charts are perfect for this purpose. They'll let you summarise your data into a table and chart and to easily reorganise both of them. 

I can't suggest any software to do this out of the box but you might get suitable results manually in Photoshop or GIMP: 

You want the inbuilt function. The and functions may also be useful for you. If you have very large data sets and/or want to do a more complex analysis then pivot tables are useful too. 

For a mirror, yes. For RAID-Z1 and RAID 5, rebuild requires parity calculations so rebuilds will take longer. 

Give your columns names (such as Title and Qty) and then create a Pivot Table with Title in the row labels and Qty in the Values (it should default to SUM). This has the advantage that if you change your source data, you can refresh the pivot table and have it recalculate. 

You should now have an opaque layer with fairly saturated colours and a layer mask creating the transparency. 

Open from the menu. From there you can apply settings to alter video playback. The tab has, among others, options for hue, saturation, contrast and gamma. You can adjust these to your own liking and save them as a default or as a selectable profile. 

The most simple way to do it is with an Scatter (X-Y) chart but this is a line chart and won't display the bars you want. To do it with bars you need to create a pivot table with date in the row labels and sum of qty as the values. Note this will only work if you only have one sample per date. Set grouping on the row labels to 'Days' and 'Years' and then go in to field settings and turn on 'Show items with no data'. Then create a pivot chart using the bar chart style. You'll get a bar chart with 365 days and the samples spaced correctly. 

You're now left with a live 'table' of your original data. If you change values in the original data, the table version will also update. If you'd like to 'disconnect' the two, you can copy the table to the clipboard and then Paste Special -> As Values. 

Rather than specifying a real file F, the filenames can be read from standard input which can be fed from a pipe. In this instance, the filenames are still expected to be NUL-terminated. A typical example of this would be 

On the first command you provided you should be referencing the .asc signature file - not the .exe file. The .exe file should also be residing in the same directory as the .asc file. From the gpg man page: 

Now might be a good opportunity to get yourself used to using Windows + D to do this. Most unlikely MS can get their positions changed across Windows upgrade :) 

ZFS takes data integrity very seriously and my personal experience with ZFS send/receive is that it's robust. I would suggest you implement your send/receive in the most straight forward manner and use scrubbing to make sure that any corruption is detected. I regularly use ZFS send/receive to backup a RAIDZ to external USB 1TB 2.5" consumer drives. Only once have I encountered an error (detected by scrubbing) on the backup disk. The scrub was done some significant time after the send/receive so I can't be sure whether the error was introduced during the transfer or occurred some time after the data was already on the disk, but I strongly suspect the latter. The backup disk was a single disk with no RAIDZ, snapshots or multiple copies, ZFS couldn't repair the single corrupted block but it was trivial to fix manually by copying the original file. 

I don't think a bootable USB drive or floppy will help you. It sounds to me like your BIOS is corrupted and your PC is not getting past POST to boot. You were on the right track with disconnecting the CMOS battery but I think you will need to manually clear the CMOS settings. Refer to page 119 of the Dimension 8400 manual (2.9MB PDF) 

Put the value 2 in a cell and copy it to the clipboard. Select the cells with the values you want to double. Paste Special and select Multiply Optional: Delete the cell containing the 2. 

Note: This will work when typed in interactively but if you are running it as a script you will need to prefix the variables with %% instead of %. 

It sounds as if your numbers are being interpreted as text by Excel. A good indication of this is that they automatically align to the left of each cell. Numbers normally are aligned to the right. If this is the case, a simple fix is to move into a cell, press F2 then Enter. Repeat for each cell containing the numbers that don't sort. This works by putting the cell into edit mode and then out again. If the contents can be interpreted as a number then Excel converts it to a number. If you have too many cells to do this manually, you can use the function to create another column contain true numeric values and then paste them (by value) back over the offending cells. 

If your time periods are (A) non-overlapping, (B) in ascending order and (C) contain no gaps then you can use VLOOKUP with approximate match (the 4th parameter to VLOOKUP being TRUE or omitted). You'll also need to reposition the number column somewhere to to right of the LowTime column since you'll want to have VLOOKUP search in LowTime and return from number. 

Try pivot tables. They will let you group, summarise, filter and sort your data with a great amount of flexibility. There are a few requirements on the way your source data should be laid out for pivoting to be most effective. Without seeing your data it is difficult to know how suitable it is.
