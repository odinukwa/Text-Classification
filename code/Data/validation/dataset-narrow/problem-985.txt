Your card is not mentioned specifically, but there is a compatibility table here. It seems different cards can work together in a crossfire setup, provided they are within the same hundred family. For instance any 69xx will work with any other 69xx, but not a 68xx card. Be sure to check that your card is crossfire capable before buying a second one. 

This photo makes it clear that the connector is next to the outer casing of the laptop, and so if the HDD were connected in your photograph, the label side would face up, with the connector closer to the bottom of the HDD. 

This page recommends adding blank accellator shortcuts to ~/.config/Terminal/terminalrc'. I run XFCE 4.8 and could not find this file myself. However, in my terminal preferences (under Edit), there is a shortcut tab. Help = F1 is the last shortcut in the list. My terminal emulator version is 0.4.8. Hopefully one of these will be applicable to you. 

This seems to be a recognized bug with CUPS 1.6.x itself. There is a discussion and workaround for Ubuntu here Hopefully this will be applicable to your situation or at least advance improve your chances of finding a solution. 

When you have a network you lose two IP addresses one for broadcast and one for the network. The first IP is reserved to refer to the network while the last ip of the range is reserved for the broadcast address. 

As far as I am aware you will not accomplish this without a little bit of programming or finding a custom app that someone else has created to do this. $URL$ contains information on a command line utility that will allow you to create a shortcut to do what you are looking for In particular look on the blog where they go into detail regarding the following options: They give you examples on how to make a shortcut to call the program using the above parameters to do exactly what you are after. As I've not tried this before I'm not sure how well it works, but if you are having some trouble with the scripting program I am sure myself or others would be able to help. Incase something happens to the above blog, the location of the actual utility is here $URL$ 

Is the problem that you are not getting an IP over wireless? If you set a static IP on your device within that network you can still contact the router? Also do you mean all interfaces besides the WAN port are bridged together? It sounds like DHCPD is not broadcasting over the bridge you setup (probably br0). From the webpage you could go to setup, networking, multiple dhcpd servers, click add and create one and choose its interface to be br0. Also you might want to go to setup, vlans and scroll to the bottom of that page and make sure the wireless box is set to LAN. I think from the web-gui this puts the radio on the LAN bridge. 

If your FTP station has a static IP address or is on the same local network, you could simply set your firewall rules on the rip station to only allow outgoing and incoming port 21 (assuming you are using a non encrypted FTP connection) to the IP address of the FTP server. This will probably be insufficient if you are trying to connect through the internet to a computer with a dynamic IP address, as used by most broadband connections. If it is on the local network it may help to assign the FTP station an IP address manually rather than by DHCP, to eliminate the chance of it changing when more computers are added to the network. 

Your error message suggests a problem, the file you are trying to open is an mp4, not an avi file. If your bink converter cannot open mp4 files, you can either convert your file to .avi with a different tool and then convert it, or you can find a different bink conversion tool. I am not able to provide a recommendation other than to google "bink mp4 conversion". 

It seems unlikely. This appears to be the only site currently offering a (partial) view of the inside of the Pixel. The instructions on disassembly have been taken down "temporarily", but until an enthusiast dismantles one this the best chance to find out if the SSD is integrated to the mainboard or is a removable module. There are chips visible in the photograph, which seem likely to be RAM (though I can't find the exact number anywhere online). EDIT: It appears that there is a single flash memory chip just to the left of the USB ports, with a circular white sticker on it. If the SSD is indeed on the motherboard, you would only be able to upgrade with external storage. An MSATA card cannot be used to upgrade because the mini-pcie port that holds the WLAN card is not wired for this. Some discussion, here. 

First, I would try to get access to chkdsk.exe if possible and run that on the drive just incase there is a problem with the filesystem and linux is just being much more picky about it. It seems that fat32 has a backup boot sector at sector 6. You could always try to replace sector 0 with that sector and see if it helps you out, but I would probably try the chkdsk route and see if that helps you out at all. 

With X and Y being two different values, Acceleration and Threshold I believe. These settings change after a reboot so you would have to add them into a startup script. A quick search says that this command will give you your current value on ubuntu, but im not in a location I can try it right now. 

I've had to deal with some issues like this on a clients workstation before. We needed a utility called CleanWipe which is only legitimately obtained from their support after opening a ticket (It might have changed). I found the following link which explains a little more about the CleanWipe tool and obtaining it $URL$ 

I have a convertible laptop/tablet with graphics tablet screen, which often logs out of the current X session whilst using GIMP 2.6. I am dropped back to the login prompt without a system wide restart. All unsaved work is lost, making this a real problem for me. This only seems to happen whilst reaching over the keyboard to draw on the screen. I have disabled the CTRLAltBackspace shortcut so I don't believe leaning on the keyboard is causing the problem. There is no output to dmesg or xsession-errors when the restart occurs. Any advice on how to track down or deal with this problem would be appreciated. OS: Linux mint 13, 64 bit (up to date) Hardware: unmodified HP Compaq 2710p, (laptop/wacom graphics tablet), no external devices connected. I have sought an answer at the XFCE forums but with no response after two weeks. 

I believe you could upgrade to an SSD drive with minimal difficulty. There is a small possibility that the drive would be blacklisted by the BIOS, which you may wish to research, but I beleive this is unlikely. The service manual indicates several SSD drives for this laptop though I believe that most 2.5 inch drives with a 7mm height should be fine. The manual also indicates that there are i7 variants of this laptop. The listed compatible parts are: 

You don't mention what OS you are running, so I am going to assume it is Windows. Assuming that all of your computers are on the same network and can talk to each other, the easiest method of accomplishing the sharing of files would be to join all of the computers onto the same workgroup and setup Windows File Sharing. Here is the link to a video that appears to walk you through the process, that might be a little more helpful than some of the steps I will detail below. $URL$ Navigate to a folder that you would like to share on one computer, right click on it and click properties. Go to the sharing tab and click share; a new window should appear. Type Everyone when asked who you want to share this with, keep in mind that setting permissions this way will allow anyone else on your wireless network to access these files. You should then notice a link that says "Network Path" above the share button. IF you copy and paste this path into Windows Explorer on any other computer on the wireless network and access the shared files. The format of the network path is \\YourPCname\shared\folder\path.From windows explorer you can also click on the "Network" option on the far left panel, this will show you the names of the computers on your network, double click on any of these to see what folders they are sharing. This should be enough to get you going and allow you to ask more specific questions to further address your needs. Let us know if you have issues with any of the above, are using a different OS, or if you were looking for something else (In which case, please provide further information) 

You should have little difficulty installing any of these provided that you buy the correct socket type, and you can handle the disassembly yourself. If your laptop is still under warranty you may wish to find an authorized service centre who could install the chip for you professionally, at added expense but leaving your warranty intact. 

A solution from link Right click Desktop, go to Properties>Appearance Click "Advanced", choose "Icon" and change size to something other than it's current size. Press "OK" to confirm changes in all relevant dialogue windows. When the icons have changed, restore the size to its original value. This should force a redraw of all icons, clearing the old images. 

It is difficult to tell you anything certain in situations like these, but data packages, phones, mobile broadband modems and other similar devices normally come with a 14 day "cooling off" period, during which you can back out, cancel your contract and get a full refund. It may be worth seeing if your supplier had such an arrangement, and if it does, you could buy and try the services you are interested in. Above all, before you pay any money, make certain that if you're not happy, you can return the device/cancel the contract. I had a similar experience with 3G 4 years ago, and since I was not able to get coverage at my house, I was able to return the device and get a full refund. 

I am preserving a manuscript written by my father. The data files are on 5.25" floppy. I have successfully read the files off the disks, but neither of us knows what format the markup language is. It is one used by book publishers back in the early 1990s. Here are a few lines from one of the files. 

Launch X11 (in the Utilities folder). This will automatically open up an xterm, the X equivalent to Terminal. Use ssh to open a connection to the VPS machine. The option will tell it to forward X data packets to your local machine. The optional will tell it to compress data packets which may or may not work out to your benefit. You will now be looking at the shell prompt on the remote machine. Launch whatever app you need, such as . The display will appear on your own machine. 

I had this happen to me when I used as an SSH server. Apparently, dropbear sets some hard limits before spawning your shell. Switching to OpenSSH solved the problem. 

I'm helping my mother organize her photos in Windows Live Photo Gallery (Windows 7). We've been scanning in slides taken decades ago. We want to arrange the photos by date, so we have been changing the "date taken" on the files. And that's where our troubles lie. To change the date, we right-click on the thumbnail and bring up the Properties. Then we enter the date the slide was taken; say, 10/16/1964. Click on OK and poof! the photo is gone. Just gone. It's not in the trash, it's not in some other folder. Perhaps it has been renamed, but I cannot find it anywhere. I can reproduce this behavior on every photo we've been editing today. We've lost about a dozen just trying to figure out what's going on. (We have backups on the SD card the scanner uses.) Yesterday was a different matter. Oddly, it all worked perfectly yesterday. We haven't changed our process. Any ideas? Update 1 It's not just Windows Live Photo Gallery. Even Windows Explorer does it. Right-click on the image file, change any of the details (subject, tags, date, etc.), click OK and the file disappears. Update 2 Solved, but it's not pretty. You may be asking: what changed between yesterday and today. Answer: McAfee updated its virus definitions. We disabled real-time protection and everything returned to normal. Re-enable real-time protection and files start disappearing. Nice. Another oddity: we went to empty the recycle bin. It said "are you sure you want to delete these 53 items?" (It contained images that we had trashed manually.) But the progress bar indicated it was actually deleting over 3,200 files. Hopefully McAfee hasn't randomly and silently deleted a bunch of other files. 

I have had a few weird problems with desktop HP printers that are similar. The only way I have gotten windows to detect the printers again in my situations was to uninstall the printer driver, reboot and install the driver from scratch and then the printer works. One in particular is more flaky than its counterparts, it is an older model and I am just assuming there is some sort of damage with the unit itself since it supposedly worked better years before, but has stayed on the same XP system. 

Also if you look in your Xorg.conf file under the section for mouse you should see an option title "Resolution" increasing this number should increase your mouse speed as well. 

Well if you are just looking for a cheap way to add an extra monitor and you can not or do not want to purchase a new video card you can always look at some of these USB video cards. The drivers for most that I have seen are only for windows systems and the cards will not be as powerful, but if you are looking for a cheap easy way to add an extra monitor, it is another option besides adding another internal video card. 

Hmm, I should be seeing some output. Ah! Forgot to listen on a different interface. At this point I'd hit the up-arrow to bring back the previous command, then either scroll back to the first argument or press C-a to jump to the start of the command and scroll forward to the first argument. Is there a quicker way to jump to the first argument so I can insert the option? 

This command will tell on the sending side to connect to port 1234 on the receiver and copy the data from stdin across the network. However, the solution has a few downsides: 

This will use far less RAM since you won't have to be running a full desktop environment on the VPS machine. Here's how I do it on my Mac: 

It's easy and straightforward, as long as you can use ssh to connect to the remote end. You can also use (NetCat) to transfer the data. On the receiving machine (e.g., host.example.com): 

This happens to me all the time: I type a long command line and forget to specify some options. For example: 

This will set up to listen to port 1234 and copy anything sent to that port to the file. Then, on the sending machine: 

You need something to create a macro for your keyboard, basically creating a new "hotkey". Many keyboards that include multimedia keys have a program that will let you create new macros and remap the keyboard. Check in your keyboard application or go to control panel -> keyboard and you might find some options buried in there. If you do not then you will need to find a third-party utility that will create a macro for any key stroke and turn it into a new one. I have not had the need to use a third-party utility as the keyboards I purchase always have a built-in option to do this. The following link provides several utilities. If you try one of these and have issues someone here might be able to help you with the configuration. $URL$ 

Yep, its just like chrisF said, Here is a KB article from microsoft explaining it as well and Here is a KB article explaining what a DLL is. Think of them as library files for programs on your computer. They hold instructions on how to do different things for different programs. When you register it you are telling your computer that you have these instructions, where there at and programs that say they need them can use them now.
