I am trying to figure out how to set up my web application so that only clients (external) with issued certificates could access it. (on Windows7) I have followd this tutorial where i got a .CER and .PVK that i could use for creating client certificates with makecert.exe But the problem was that I could not import a .CER file to server. When i followed this tutorial i got an error 

I was told that i have to create the .CER via CER Authority, so I got myself a Windows Server and installed Active Directory Certificate services where i first created the request in IIS and issued myself a .CER file that I could normally import in my IIS on Windows7. But now when I try to create client certificates I am missing private key file. Can some one please help me with this issue, since I have never fone this before and I am having trouble understanding the procedure. 

I am going to close out this question even though I have not fixed the problem. I am not seeing any convergence on an answer. I very much appreciate all of the responders time and input. I am going to spend the next day starting from ground zero an re-building the vpn connection. If I am still having problems I may open a new question. I know much more from everyone's suggestions and inputs. Again, thanks for all of your help. Regards, Steve Mansfield 

The role successfully installed and I am getting "green" on the role status indicators. The server firewall is enabled but I wrote a netsh script to "firewall set portopening All" for ports 1723 and 47. I am using windows 7 VPN login using PPTP protocol and I am directing the VPN connection to the static IP addr lan port. Like I said I can successfully login into my VPN but I cannot see any of my network resources. I can also remote log in with no problems at all. 

I am a new administrator to Windows Server 2008 R2. I am trying to set up a VPN connection to my server with not much luck. Thus far I can connect to my server with a VPN PPTP connection but I cannot see any of the public files on my server or see any other resources on the lan. I have a dual port LAN card with one set to a static IP address connected to a cable modem. The other lan port is configured to obtain an IP address automatically and is connected to a wireless router/firewall that is then connected to cable modem. All of my other lan resources(workstations) are also connected to this router/firewall. The firewall is enabled on this wireless router. The cable modem is configured as a bridge -- in other words the firewall is turned off. At least that is what COMCAST explained to me. I installed Network Policy and Access Services Role and included, 

You can try using Phalanger. It is a PHP compiler for .Net, and as you are running a windows server with IIS, this seems to be the best option, as it will increase performance of the PHP application. 

I'm looking for some help. We got a WAN, which includes several different locations across US and Europe. Now I have a need that when someone SSH to a DNS, he will get connected to a server close to his location. When I was looking around for info, all I could find is DNS redirect based on Geo location. But I would need it for internal IPs, so no Geo location information available. And looking at the DNS record types, I don't think I can set it up with just another DNS record. 

Do you have in the vhost config for this directory? AFAIK this is required. I would also change the user to 

At this point I'm not sure what else to try. I already copied the whole TFTP to the HTTP server, tried using gPXE scripts which will rewrite the source using DHCP option 209/210. But they all fail because I cannot load it in the DHCP config using HTTP. Can anybody give me some hints on where to look for errors, or how I could convert my current PXELINUX to gPXE. Any help much appreciated. UPDATE: I was playing around, and finally got it working. Was an error in the DHCP config. Here is what I'm using now: 

The server runs in a farm with another two 32 bit Windows 2003 servers with code built for 64 bit environment. This only happens on new 64 bit server, where the IIS worker process starts "eating up" the memory. I have temporary resolved the problem with setting the application pool recycling in IIS. What could be the issue? Another info is that I am using 32 bit application pool, because one of the components is not build (yet) for 64 bit environment. Any help regarding this leak would be appreciated! 

Resolution: Deleted the groups AS_Observers and AS_Administrators (if they are there), and then installation succeeded. Good day. 

I have created certificates based on this tutorial: $URL$ Then I have imported "MyPersonalCA.cer" on IIS host server based on this tutorial: $URL$ I had to import the certificate via MMC, because IIS is giving me an error: "Cannot find the certificate request associated with this certificate file. A certificate request must be completed on the computer where it was created." As stated this is a known bug, but i cant get pass the error. I have imported certificate in Certificate (LocalComputer) snap in and provided a friendly name. It all looks ok. But i still cant select the certificate on my webpage binding in IIS when trying to enable SSL. EDIT Ok I went as suggested and issued the .CER file via CertAuthority. On another machine I have installed Windows Server and CA. I have created a request in IIS and issued myself a .CER file. This file I can normaly import to Windows7 IIS. But now I want to create client certificates. The certificate is missing PVK file and i cant create client certificates as described in the first link. Will post another question ... System: Windows7 Home Premium SP1 32bit,IIS 7.5 Can someone point me to the right direction on this? 

I am trying to connect to my work desktop computer through a VPN connection using Microsofts Remote Desktop Connection at home. I get a successful VPN connection but when I enter my work computers name, userid, and password through Microsofts Remote Desktop Connection I get a "Cannot find Computer" error message. If I use the IP address instead of the computer name I am able to successfully log into my work desktop computer. How come my remote VPN connection cannot see my work computer's name but the IP address works fine? Also when VPN connected I cannot see other computers on the work network. I am able to remote desktop connect using my computers name when I am at work on the same LAN. I know many would say what's the problem, just use the IP address. However, I am trying to set up a remote desktop access proceedure for other employees in the company who are not that computer literate. I can easily find my remote computers IP address but it is not that simple for others. I am running Windows 7 Professional on our work desktops and VPN through our Windows 2008 R2 Server. Any ideas? 

If you are looking for Cluster Filesystems, there are plenty open/closed solutions available. Just to name a few: GFS, Lustre, GlusterFS, OCFS2, Veritas Cluster FS. The last one is a commercial enterprise FS, but out of experience the best one. Edit: Forgot to mention that any of these should resist on a SAN device shared across all Cluster Nodes. It is also a requirement for Veritas CFS. 

I have already opened a issue for pyvmomi ($URL$ but no answer so far. Basically what I want to do is run the Guest customization after I have deployed a OVF to the ESXi. On a vCenter server, this is working as expected. But it is failing on ESXi I guess the main question is, if Guest customization is working or not on a single ESXi server. If anyone can answer this, or even better, has experience with using PowerCLI or PyVmomi to do this with ESXi. I'm out of ideas. Thanks, Christian 

You don't need mod_rewrite for this. It would only bee needed if you want to catch any error to a specific error page. 

One possible cause could be if 'HostnameLookups' is enabled for the Apache server. This would cause no delay on a local network, but could cause a slightly delay when access is happening from the outside, as it has to send more requests to nameservers.
