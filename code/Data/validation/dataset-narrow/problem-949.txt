First, manually make the change from to inside just one of the fields, and then select the whole field code (including braces), and press Ctrl+C to copy it. Then, in the Find and Replace dialog box, in the Find what field, type as you did before. Then move the cursor into the Replace with field, and either select Special > Clipboard Contents or just type . 

Alternatively, I could have had Word add a paragraph after option D that said "Correct answer:" followed by the value from the correct answer column. Or I could have just generated a numbered list of all the values from the correct answer column. 

This is like Fleet Command's solutions, but doesn't insert static text or show only 1 page of each inserted document. 

Once you've done this, you can make changes to the bookmarked text in document A and then update document B so that it shows those changes. Or, you can make changes to the inserted text in document B and save those changes back to document A: 

In this condition I do not think You can fix it via ssh. Do You have access to any form of console (e.g.: serial)? How did You create (or where did You get) Your RootFS? If You have access to console try: 

The right answer seems to be to unpack the tar archive using fakeroot (to avoid becoming root) and then use rsync. Possibly repack the archive, if needed. Unfortunately things are not this easy because bad interaction between ssh and fakeroot. I will detail what I did to help whoever will search. Theory is straightforward: 

Sure enough solves the issue, but it will be back at next VM boot. How can I set this permanently? (note I have no local xserver on VM, so I don't have a and similar files) I would also like to understand what happened. Can someone suggest where to look? 

create a temp directory unpack tar archive into it rysnc as needed if something changed locally repack int a new tar archive cleanup 

Right-click the Heading 3 paragraph style, click Modify, and then select Frame in the Format drop-down to put Heading 3 text into a frame. By default, the Text wrapping property will be set to Around, creating a run-in heading that shows up in the navigation pane and doesn't require hidden paragraph marks. You might have to adjust the style's paragraph settings (especially Spacing: Before, Spacing: After, and Line spacing) and/or the frame's position properties to make the text properly lined up with the text that wraps around it. 

Any headings that are added or styled in the future should now be correctly numbered or lettered. For the level-2 headings that are currently numbered (lettered) incorrectly, you can manually reset the numbering by right-clicking one of the letters that should be 'A' and then clicking Restart at A. (For other heading levels, the name of the menu command may be Restart at 1, Restart at a, Restart at i, or something else, depending on the setup of the multilevel list.) 

I had a similar situation on a Windows 7 laptop where nearly 500 GB was "missing" on my system partition. The partition was full, but Windows Explorer was unable to detect the missing space, and the "windirstat" program simply showed a 500 GB "unknown" entry. However, the TreeSize Free (Administrator) program ($URL$ was able to show what the problem was, namely that someone had misconfigured the Cobian Backup program such that the source and destination directories were the same. As a consequence, it recursed until the partition filled up AND made nearly infinitely long directory paths that neither Windows Explorer nor windirstat were able to handle. Perhaps needless to say, none of the Windows directory removal tools, including cmd rmdir, would work to remove this mess and it was with great difficulty that I finally managed to clean it up. 

(The worse case i've encountered is that after uninstalling the intel HD Graphics 520 display drivers, over 200 driver files are left behind that HAVE to be manually deleted AFTER uninstalling, because if they are not manually deleted, the new driver bundle will absolutely NOT install correctly leaving things like graphics acceleration completely broken.) 

After a bit of investigation I found out can do what I need. Here comes an excerpt from standard documentation (Dnsmasq setup): 

I have a router running, among other things, with standard setup, so I get DNS proxy plus additional local servers, plus name resolution for all machines whose IP address is managed via DHCP server. Servers and other hosts are on my domain So far so good. Now I need to connect via VPN to a customer site () who has a very similar setup (they are not using dnsmasq, but net effect is the same). I set up a small (virtual) machine acting as router forwarding (with NAT) from local network to IPSec device and added a few static routes to the (2) hosts needing to see customer.net; I did this manually instead of pushing the routes through dnsmasq. Also this seems to work without problems. Now I have the last problem I don't know how to solve: I can access machines in private address space only specifying the IP address, no DNS resolution is available from How can I access without losing connection with ? NOTE: I can modify my setup (I would prefer to limit changes to the few hosts actually involved), but I have no control on Situation I would like to have is: 

On the References tab, in the Table of Contents group, click Table of Contents > Custom Table of Contents. Click Options, and then, in the list of styles under the Styles check box, delete the 1 next to Heading 1 (or whatever style you're using for part headings). Select the Table entry fields check box. 

If paragraph marks aren't visible in Word, make them visible by pressing Ctrl+Shift+8. You should see that the paragraph mark (¶) at the end of list item 4 and all the following list items is blue, like this: 

On the References tab, in the Table of Contents group, click Table of Contents > Custom Table of Contents. In the Table of Contents dialog box, if you don't want page numbers to appear in your TOC, clear the Show page numbers check box. Click Options. Scroll down the Available styles list until you reach the heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, and so on). Clear out any numbers in the TOC level field for these and other styles. Enter an appropriate number in the TOC level field for each paragraph style that you're using for your lists (for example, enter 1 in the field for the List Number style, 2 in the field for List Number 2, and 3 in the field for List Number 3). Click OK twice to insert the TOC. If the indents and spacing of the paragraphs in the TOC aren't what you want, adjust the appropriate paragraph styles that are used for the TOC (by default, TOC 1, TOC 2, and so on). 

Download the barebones Intel drivers specific to your OS version for the 8260 wifi chipset from here: 

i never could get the intel dual band wireless-ac 8260 chipset to work reliably in several new (VERY expensive) Panasonic CF-54 laptops. my experience has lead me to believe the problem is the massive Proset bloatware, not the barebones drivers or the chipset. This is my fix for W7, but the steps are the same for W8/10: I spent days (weeks really) trying everything I could think of and many suggestions from intel and the internet as well. nothing worked. the chipset was balky in connecting if it would connect at all, and when it did connect, it was almost always REALLY, REALLY, REALLY slow and frequently disconnected! And this was the case with multiple different routers, both old and new. In complete despair, I finally decided to completely nuke the MASSIVE (and as far as I could tell, nearly useless) bloatware known as Intel Proset/Wireless and instead just install the basic Intel WiFi drivers and let Microsoft manage the WiFi (which Microsoft has almost always done flawlessly since Vista SP1) and see if that might fix the problem. It did fix the problem! Here's what to do: 

Create a style for these notes (or repurpose an existing style that you won't use for anything else), and, in the Font properties, select the Hidden check box. Users will then see the text if the Show/Hide ¶ option is selected in the Paragraph group on the Home tab (or if the Hidden text check box is selected under Always show these formatting marks on the screen on the Display tab in Word Options); otherwise, the text will be hidden. It will also be hidden when the doc is printed, converted to a PDF, or read in Word's Read Mode view. 

Of course, this approach assumes that the numbering starts right on the first page of the actual file. If you also have a cover page and other front matter for each guide, you'll need to insert a section break before the content that you want to number in this way. You'll also need to adjust the page number format so that the numbering starts at 1. 

I need to reach remote sparse machines (ARM Linux Appliances) for maintenance and support. All these machines are Customer owned and plugged into their own private LANs (where I have no privilege), normally behind a light firewall NATting the LAN to the Internet. Interaction should be started by Customer (from the Arm Linux Appliance) requesting assistance. Customers (with few exceptions) are not really technically minded, so I can not ask them any setup, just "press that button" when They call me. I do Have an Internet-exposed server I can use as rely, but my main development machine is behind another NATting router/firewall. All I need is basic console access (Appliances have no KVM) via ssh or equivalent. I tried several available solutions (n2n, tinc, pwnat), but I must be missing something essential because all solutions install with no problem, seem to connect to their net (ifconfig shows traffic), but then they do not appear to work (I cannot ping Appliance). I also noticed the above software is quite old, sometimes obsoleted. What is the current advised "best practice"? I am aware of LogMeIn (and I will evaluate it), but I would like, if at all possible, to avoid incurring in costly royalties.
