From reading Dell help, and the following document: $URL$ It seems the last configuration will the best performance one - is this correct? Also, is there any real difference between UDIMM and RDIMM for this kind of configuration? Thanks! 

We seem to have some issue with recovering Exchange 2003 data via BackUp Exec 12.5 to Recovery Storage Group. We have set-up a dial-tone Exchange database, and now trying to restore latest backup to new recovery group. Problem is, it seems as BackUp Exec recovers the data to the dial-tone database instead of Recovery Group. There is no way to select destination in BackUp Exec, but I was sure Exchange alone knows where to restore data. I also double-checked the "this database can be overwritten by restore" check-boxes on dial-tone and recovery data-bases - it's unchecked on dial-tone, and checked on recovery, as instructed in every article. Following this guide doesn't seem to help - it still restores to dial-tone: $URL$ P.S.: if this doesn't work, how safe is restoring the backup directly to dial-tone, and just using it as the production data-base from now on? Thanks for any ideas! 

We have re-created RAID1 on our IBM X3400, with the 8K-l RAID card, and now the RAID1 is in status of Quick Initialized. I've read online that the performance of this status is might not be optimal, and some actions required to bring the operation paramters to optimal. Is this correct, and would the synchronize action (as I don't see anything else available) help? Thanks! 

We have a logical RAID1 drive in bad stripes state, which kept that status even after replacement and rebuilding of both drives, and gives errors in Windows logs about failure of writing to disk. IBM support suggests erasing and re-creating the RAID, then re-installing the Windows. The resulting down-time unacceptible for us, so we want to clone the RAID (via Acronis True Image), erase and re-create the RAID, then dump the cloned data back. Following IBM logic where RAID erasing and re-creation resets the whole RAID meta-data, this should clear the bad-stripes status, and start from a blank page. Question is if such strategy is possible, and will produce the desired effect? Any idea is appreciated - thanks in advance! 

Can anyone explain what is the major difference between Heartbeat and UCarp for IP fail-over scenarios? They both seem to provide this functionality, perhaps UCarp simpler to set-up? Thanks. 

Is there any specific module/package in Linux responsible for initiating shut-down, once the power-off button was pressed? I installed a minimal version of CentOS Linux by removing the base package, and the power-off button stopped working. It does works fine in regular installation, so there must be some package missing? 

We have started using the DFS sharing functionality in Windows 2008 R2 (previously we used regular shares on Windows 2003), and noticed that for every office document we work on, it's work-file (filename starting with ~) is kept on the DFS-shared volume, so we have to erase them manually. Did this happen to anyone else, and is this a known issue? Searching online doesn't produce any meaningful results. Thanks. 

From the dump it seems as problem in driver, but I can't just get what driver responsible for this. I will appreciate any hint what could be the culprit, or how to hunt for one. Thanks! 

Can anyone recommend a good open-source inventory-agent, which would help enumerate both software and hardware on Linux servers? Thanks. 

We use GnuPG for encrypting data, which we upload to a central storage. The public key is being stored on a web-server, and the encrypting script re-downloads it if it's changed. This was done in order to easily refresh the public key every so often on all the servers. After some security thinking, I got the paranoia, that someone can (unlikely, but potentially), break into the web-server, and replace the public key with his own. This would give 2 very unpleasant effects: 1) The hacker could read the data, if he manages to break out into the central storage as well. 2) Even if he doesn't - we won't be able to read the data as well as the private key got changed, and it all can be considered as lost! Can someone advice how to prevent this threat, or perhaps suggest a more robust, but still convenient, key refresh approach? Thanks! 

We ghosted our old Windows 2003 drive to a new 1TB one, and connected through new PCI SATA card. The x260m server fails to boot with error 1962: "Boot sector not found." When we connect the drive directly to motherboard, it boots fine, so the problem is probably in getting BIOS to boot from the SATA card. Has anyone encountered and solved such issue? EDIT: We tried disabling the on-board Sata controller (Hostraid/SAS?), but there is no such option - only enable, enhanced and compatible. Tried also to chance boot device priority to all possible choices - no luck. Thanks in advance! 

We have a file-cluster on servers with multiple disks, and we have created a software RAID1 over boot and / partitions, planning that if a single disk goes down, we still will be able to boot and serve data from the remaining disks. The problem is that when one of disks missing, the server when booting up, displays the following error: fsck.ext3: Unable to resolve LABEL LABEL is one of the missing disks partition - boot and / RAID1 partitions seem to work fine. Is there any configuration to ignore these errors, and just bring the server online? So if there one of disks missing, the server will ignore any errors, and just will continue booting? 

I'm trying to make two physical interfaces visible to a Xen machine. I followed the guide ($URL$ and created two Xen bridges for two physical interfaces / updated the guest config file with the new bridge. The problem is that my guest machines are still unable to see the eth1. I'll appreciate anyone who had success with this posting any notes or checklist. The host (Dom0) is CentOS 5.5 64-bit, guest is CentOS 5.3 64-bit. The used Xen is version 3.0.3. Thanks! 

I'm trying to clone an existing single disk (on Windows server) to RAID 1 via new ServeRAID M1015 / SAS9220-8I HBA card, but can't find in the card's bios options any way to do so. Can anyone advice about this particular controller, if it possible to clone an existing disk? The only other way I can think of, is making a new RAID-1 from scratch, then trying to clone the existing disk to it via disk cloning tools, but really prefer not to do this because of possible complications. Thanks. 

I'm trying to figure out how $RPM_BUILD_ROOT relates to BuildRoot. It's clear that BuildRoot is the temporary path used during RPM construction. But here for example, they say buildroot is used during actual installation? $URL$ " RPM_BUILD_ROOT â€” This environment variable is used to hold the "build root", into which the newly built software will be installed. If no explicit build root has been specified (either by command line option, spec file tag line, or rpmrc file entry), this variable will be null. " So, does buildroot has any effect during actual installation? Or it's only needed for RPM building, and user always specifies the target path via --prefix? Also, during files and postun sections, any sense to use the buildroot? If not, what is the correct way to specify files and directories, taking into account the prefix set by user? Thanks. 

I have a CentOS server with 4 disks, each with 1TB that totals to 3.636 TB of usable space (according to $URL$ But the server df command shows the following status: 

We are buying new Dell R410 servers, and I'm trying to figure out the best RAM performance we can get. Dell offers the following choices: 

The solution suggested on Citrix forums was pretty simple - connect network cable to second NIC, and move all machines to it. Surprisingly, it helped. 

but Apache complains that: [warn] default VirtualHost overlap on port 80, the first has precedence Any idea if/how it possible to have Apache merge the both configurations? 

Trying to install web package in WebPI via Cygwin SSH (for automation) returns this error: There was an error reading IIS configuration schema from 'C:\Windows\system32\inetsrv\config\schema\'. When launched from the desktop Cygwin it works fine. Any idea what permissions might be missing, and how this can be solved? 

I have multiple WSGI instances running each on it's own user account. I'm trying to give the users to reload their own HTTPD processes only on Python/DJango code update, without impacting the other users (as full Apache restart would do). Any way to accomplish this? 

We have set up a XenServer, and trying to set-up a CentOS 6 guest VM. The installation went fine (using RHEL 6 template), but I'm unable to properly configure the network. The guest VM is able to ping the host machine, but unable to ping any outside machines or gateway. The network settings look just fine - same subnet range and valid IP. Any idea what else I can check? Thanks! 

Has anyone tried the second option, and how it worked out? I'm especially interested in High-Availability performance under such environment. Thanks. 

Does anyone has a good experience of setting a staging area in a remote data center? Should it be on a separate VLAN, or it can run in same LAN, by tight control of which servers are allowed to boot from DHCP? My idea in general is to allow something similar to our local staging area - but instead of bringing servers here, deploying then shipping to data center, they will be delivered directly to the data center and be deployed there. Regards. 

We have a really strange issue with recently installed DNS server. No matter which request submitted, it always returns 1.1.1.1, until the whole server is restarted. Restarting only the DNS service doesn't help. After the restart, the issue returns after some time. Has anyone encountered this, and can recommend how to resolve this? Thanks. 

Have a strange issue on freshly installed CentOS 6, with Samba Windows 2008 R2 authentication. The login succeeds, and even the home directory created, but then I'm thrown back to the login scren again. The message log contain the following errors: 

I'm trying to install CentOS 5.11 on DL160 G5, with 4 bays holding 3TB sized drives. The installation with default partition layout completes successfully, however on boot I get to a blinking cursor screen - it's not even reaching GRUB. I've tried updating BIOS to latest one available (17/11/2011), and even manually sizing the boot partition to 200 MB - it's still has the same effect. I presume a GPT needs to be used (rather than the default MBR), however unable to find how to enable it during the installation. 

Having failures to build RPM using some spec file which works great for other users, I found out that it for some reason changes the current directory to rpmbuild/BUILD: 

I need to keep ProxyPass configurations in separate files due to deployment system we use in following form: File 1: 

So on overall, I'm about 900 GB short. Any idea where that space went, and how I can get it back? Thanks! 

with the message "sda not found". As the SSD is SATA3, shouldn't it be called via the standard sdX names? The machine is physical (Tyan AFAIR), and I'm trying to deploy latest CentOS 5.x via TheForeman, which includes DHCP/TFTP and Puppet. The disks are SanDisk Industrial/ Embedded SSD (32 GB), mounted via 2.5 to 3.5 adapter to server disk brackets and connected directly to the motherboard SATA ports 

To anyone with OpenShift Origin experience, is there any benefit in skipping any IaaS infrastructure (like OpenStack), and installing the PaaS layer right on top of hardware? What would be the upsides and downsides of such approach? Thanks. 

I have quite strange situation, where my CentOS 5.5 box loads are high, but the CPU and memory used are pretty low: 

Is it possible for both Xen host and Xen guest to share same IP (albeit with different ports)? We have a single public IP, and want to have both the Xen host (as host only, no other role) and the Xen guest, to use it. Thanks. 

We just installed Exchange 2010 for transition from 2003, and before continuing, wanted to upgrade to available SP1. Reading the forums, I seen a lot of complains about list of required hot-fixes and general in-compatibility. So question - is it worth hunting all these hot-fixes and install the SP1? Or it better skip this update and wait for SP2? Thanks. 

I'm trying to prevent the search engines from crawling through SSL version of the site, to prevent content duplication and canonization issues. I found the following great article: $URL$ Problem is, that I'm using lighttpd, which doesn't seem to have the RewriteCond directive, to limit the rewriting only to SSL. Can anyone advice if this possible on lighttpd, and give a snippet? Thanks in advance! 

For other users on same machine exactly, it stays in the directory it was launched, and able to find the required files, so it works fine. I double checked my .rpmmacros, and the only entry is the topdir pointing to rpmbuild directory. The SPEC file is: 

Solved by splitting to two VD's, one small with just enough space to contain the boot partition, and the other with the rest of partitions. 

After several years of using MySQL, I've encountered some security issue that quite baffle me. I create a new database, and a new user, then grant CRUD rights only to the new DB, to this user. But when I log in either via some MySQL client, or via CLI mysql, I can read and change data in all databases. I double-checked myself and verified that I should have access only to single DB - still I can access every DB. Is there any setting for MySQL that just cause it to ignore the security, and I have accidentally turned it on? Thanks. 

Can someone provide cons and pros for having DHCP in a data center? I know this is usually a taboo, but maybe there were developments which alleviate the said issues? Thanks. 

When trying to install requirements.txt (or anything else for the matter), pip just time-outs every time with host reset message. This happens only under VirtualBox (guest CentOS 6.4 64-bit, host Windows 7 64-bit), and only for pip/easy_install tools. Almost appears as pypi CDN just flat out rejects the connections. Anyone knows what can cause this, and how this can be resolved? 

I have some open-source Xen images (.img), that I want to convert to VirtualBox. Both the methods I tried (convertfromraw or to .xva via xva.py then to ova via XenConvert) produce FATAL: Fatal: No bootable medium found!. Any idea what the most reliable method is for performing this conversion? Thanks in advance. 

Any idea whether Google bills for IP that are attached to stopped VMs, and is it the same rate as for an unused IP? (which actually makes sense). 

I'm planning to migrate from MySQL to PostgreSQL, but worried about the apparent luck of replications solutions there. Are there any current replication techniques that can be used out of box? Heartbeat/DRBD would probably work, but I'm looking for approaches that are more integrated in PostgreSQL itself. 

Found it, apparently our router doesn't like the extra hope the virtual machine adds, works fine in another place. 

The 29GB of primary disk coming up with Ubuntu 14.04 are not enough for our needs. Also (from what I understood), the attachable disks are not SSD. Is there an updated method of resizing the primary disk, rather then the one described in the somewhat outdated guide here? $URL$
