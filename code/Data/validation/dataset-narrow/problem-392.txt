I receive database notification mail whenever a job fails. Error message of the failed job (Step Id=0 in the Job History) is included in the mail; 

One of our developers with blanket privilege on a database wanted to create a regular user mapped to a login when what he mistakenly created was a user without login and now I'm unable to remove the user. command runs forever with no result nor an error. The user doesn't own any schemas as well. How can I remove this user? Thank you 

There are agent jobs with multiple steps in our servers and all their steps are defined as "go to the next step" "On Failure". So, even a job step fails, operator doesn't get notified because eventually the job succeeds. How can I modify all steps in all jobs so that job fails reporting failure if a step fails? edit: best way, I guess, would be to use msdb.dbo.sp_update_jobstep dynamically to update all steps where @on_fail_action !=2 Thanks all. 

I was just wondering what might be causing this implicit conversion as both the parameter and the field data type "UserName" is varchar(64)? SP is called from framework like this: 

but not the step's failure message (Step Id > 0 in the Job History). I also want to see the step's message so that I can identify the root cause directly from looking at the mail. For example, step 1's message in the above example. Is it possible to include a job step's failure message within the alert mail? 

What are my options in moving result of a query in one server to another table on another server? Data contains ~400.000 rows so it won't be a quick one. (Both of them are SQL Server 2008 R2) Thanks all. 

How can I integrate the replace function into the select statement so that all characters other than alphanumeric, comma and space in the result set are replaced by ' ' (space). This one won't work: 

I want to schedule a Full Text Index's population to keep it more up to date rather than leaving it to Automatic and not knowing the next population time as the users are complaining about the data they enter would not show up until too long a time has passed. For this, I right click on the table on which Full Text Index is defined and go to Schedules. It asks to choose the "Population Type". "Table-Incremental" and "Table-Update" are two of the options. I don't want to go with the "Table-Full" option as it might consume a lot of resources. What is the difference between these two ("Table-Incremental" and "Table-Update") options? Thank you. 

How can I find the query causing the missing index DMVs suggesting to create a particular index? Thank you. 

I have a scheduled job which runs nightly. I want it to stop itself at 07:00AM in the morning whether or not it is completed. I have seen some duplicates in the site but they don't exactly address the problem. Thanks. 

There is a non-clustered index on Username column of the Member table. Plan cache shows an Implicit Conversion as such: 

I ran sp_spaceused and Disk Usage by Top Tables standard report for a table. The results for sp_spaceused are: name rows reserved data index_size unused SomeTable <1301755> <7691344 KB> <3931672 KB> <3673840 KB> <85832 KB> However Disk Usage by Top Tables report shows: 

Recently I logged myself as a different user (testUser) but now that user seems to be persisted in the drop-down menu of connection dialogue box and I couldn't find a way of getting rid of it. Even worse, it seems to be the default login as whenever I change my connection I have to go to the drop-down menu and choose my usual user otherwise the connection will be made in testUser's context. How can I get rid of testUser from connection dialogue box? Thank you. 

We are migrating our SQL Server 2008 R2 to another physical server. For this, I will script out all jobs and run it on the target server. My question is about handling the schedules: When a job is scripted out, there is a parameter called of type uniqueidentifier for the step . Should I include or remove this parameter from the script? Is this value specific to the original server and therefore should not be included? If so, how can I create the matching one on the target server? Thank you. 

It was working alright on the previous server. How can I resolve it? I'm on SQL Server 2008 R2 Thank you. 

Can you please help me in querying the plan cache in order to see which queries perform a scan and which queries perform a seek operation for a particular (nonclustered) index? I'm on SQL Server 2008 R2? 

I'm trying to write a query which replaces the special characters with space. Below code helps to identify the rows. (alpha-numeric characters, comma and space is valid): 

LastLSN + 1 of the Full database backup will fall in between the FirstLSN and LastLSN of its subsequent transaction log backup. ($URL$ 

Query involving full text search is generating the following error message after restoring the database to a new server: 

I have a strange behaviour on one of my SQL Server's tempdb. It has six tempdb files, according to SSMS and queries, all pointing to S directory. Each of them have ~5gb of initial size. The weird thing is S is quorum actually with only 2gb of free space. Tempdb files simply don't exist in S nor in its sub directories. The question is where are the tempdb files? :) How can I physically see them? Thank you. 

I have a database with 5 .ndf (secondary) datafiles on SQL Server 2008 R2. (Each of these datafiles is assigned to a separate filegroup.) I want to know what data is there in those files. Is it possible? I know there are full text indexes in these filegroups (and since there is only one file per filegroup maybe the sole purpose of creating this many files were to place full text indexes in different filegroups, I don't know). I want to make sure there is no data other than full text indexes. Thank you 

I have a full text index defined as 'Automatic' radio button checked on in its Catalog. When I modify a word in the full text indexed column, the new word appears in the sys.dm_fts_index_keywords but the old,updated value does not disappear and still shows in the list. It is also true when a word is deleted from the column as well. When I rebuild the catalog though the old (or deleted) word drops off the list. It looks like full text indexes does not honour deleted words. Why would that be? 

My full back-up starts daily at 02:00 AM. It takes about 3 hours. I also take T-Log back-ups every 15 minutes (at 15,30,45 and 00 hours). I can verify the LSN sequences of T-log backups when I "restore headeronly". However, there seem to be a gap between the last LSN of the full backup and the T-log backup taken immediately after backup had started (i.e 02:15) Below is restore headeronly output from the full backup started at 02:00 FirstLSN: 76583000073086500011 LastLSN: 76595000084143900001 ...and this is the restore headeronly output from the log backup started at 02.15 FirstLSN: 76570000086250400001 LastLSN: 76571000009693900001 Shouldn't the last LSN of the full back up and first LSN of log back up be the same? I compared the LSNs of the log back up taken at 05:15 and 05:00 (when the full back up has finished) but there is no sequence again. I also checked RESTORE FILELISTONLY of the full backup and CreateLSN, DropLSN of log file is 0. What is it that I might be missing here? Thank you. 

We have a reporting query which is erratic in terms of execution plan and run duration. It is either 5 seconds or as slow as 5 minutes. The query is a Select statement with no DML involved. One thing I noticed is the costly Eager Spool operator after an index scan in slow executions. However, index seek is used when executing fast. I updated the stats but it didn't help to speed up. I was just wondering why sometimes optimiser chooses to use Index Scan (and Eager Spool) rather than Index Seek and what causes it to do so? Attaching SS of both slow and fast execution plans. SS is saved as a file from Plan Explorer so may upload some other tabs if need be. Thank you Edit: The query runs fast in the mornings, slow in the afternoons, always.
