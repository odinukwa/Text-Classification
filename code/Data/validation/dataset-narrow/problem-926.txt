For multiple instances of SQL server 2000 servers on the same server, how can I set up to use static ports? I tried to search it on the Internet and i came across This article. If I use this article, how will assign port number for seperate instances? Thanks in advance. 

Execute LogShipping_Destination_Schema & LogShipping_Destination_Logic in master on destinations server Run: exec bts_ConfigureBizTalkLogShipping @nvcDescription = '', @nvcMgmtDatabaseName = '', @nvcMgmtServerName = '', @SourceServerName = null, -- null indicates that this destination server restores all databases @fLinkServers = 1 -- 1 automatically links the server to the management database 

The above process creates linked server with integrated security for authorisation. Work around-change the security on linked server to use service account. 

To find out edition of SSRS, go to: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\90\Setup Bootstrap\Log on the server which has SSRS Open the Summary.txt file. Look for the log file for Product : Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services. In the SSRS log file, search for keyword "edition" 

I can backup and restore databases on Microsoft SQL server Analysis Service 2008 using GUI as from Backup SSAS I want to schedule backup and restore it to another server every night. so what i did is : I scripted out the backup and restore process from the GUI. Created a new SQL server agent job in database engine and added a "Run SSAS query" step. Copied the scripts to this step. But it fails. the scripts that the GUI copied out look like: 

The drops you can see in the graph are the cron jobs running and eating up more space trying to free some space. MySQL binary logs are not enabled. 95% of the disk space used on this server is located in the /var/lib/mysql/dashboard_production which is the directory where the MySQL data is stored. We have had this issue before with a different application (Zabbix monitoring) and had to dump the DB and re-import in order to free up space. This was a very painful process and not a very elegant solution but it ultimately worked. Is there any way we can reclaim this disk space ? What we can do this stop this behavior ? Edit 1 We are indeed using innoDB and we are not using configuration directive "innodb_file_per_table". As requested by Felix, the output of the command is the following : 

I have a tricky question for you, well at least seems tricky to me. Here is the setup. I have a linux file server and another linux server. I am looking to use the disk space from the filer server on the other linux server. The only catch is that I would like the data to be encrypted on the filer server to avoid have random people looking into the data. So to sum up, the data needs to be encrypted on the file server but mountable on the other linux server via NFS or some other protocol. The solution needs to be at least free and/or open source. Thank you in advance for your help ! 

I am setting up biztalk logshipping for Biztalk 2009 database. Following $URL$ article, I am doing the following to setup biztalk logshipping on destination server: Enable Ad-hoc queries by: 

I have migrated some DTS packages to SSIS 2005 using "Migration" wizard. When I tried to run it, it fails saying you need a higher version of SSIS even though the destination SSIS server is on 9.0.4211 level. then I digged in the package using business intelligence studio and saw that one of the package subtasks is "Transform data task" (the dts version) and the package fails to run that. The storage location for this dts task is set to "Embedded in Task". I didn't touch it. why didn't it convert this task to an SSIS data flow task? any help please? Thansk in advance 

Are there any general rules/tips which we can use to run Sql Server Reporting Services 2005 reports faster? I have been tuning the Tsql behind the reports but does there exist any SSRS specific performance tuning? regards Manjot 

On a SQL server, why do we need a weekly update stats job (with full scan) when we have AUTO_UPDATE_STATISTICS=ON for all databases? Doesn't this option update statistics all the time? Regards 

A solution to this is CloudFlare. It acts as a reverse proxy for your site and blocks DDoS attacks. It can also perform security checks and reputation checking for the IPs trying to access your site. 

Short answer : no. Not over the public Internet. One way to do this is to set up a MPLS link between these two networks or a VPN. 

Sun VM = Virtualbox. Hardware assisted virtualization. Very much like VMWare but with a lot of Open Source. Very good solution for desktop uses. Xen = NOT a linux kernel patch set. This is utterly wrong. Xen is a full-blown hypervisor. It sits below the Linux/Unix kernel. The kernel of the OS running atop can be patched to work with Xen which allows native speed for VMs. It is an open source projet from which the Citrix version was derived after they bought the trademark. Xen kernel patches are now integrated into mainstream Linux kernel (called pvops). VirtualBox = See Sun VM. Oracle VM = Xen packaged and adapted by Oracle. Sun xVM = Xen adaptation to OpenSolaris. No plans to have it removed... It is even in Oracle's roadmap. All are here to stay. Oracle VM is Xen for Linux and Sun xVM is Xen for OpenSolaris. 

Work around- used dynamic sql to capture all logins, stored it into a temporary table. Scripted out for the ones needed and then ran executesql. 

I am a database administrator and I need to move SQL databases from one server to another for enterprise project management, Project Server 2007 installed on WSS 3.0 (both at patch level SP2 + Aug09 CU). I know how to move databases but I don't know how to re-point the application to the new server. Can anyone please help me? - Thanks! 

SQl services are runing under different domain accounts. So, I asked the domain admin to create SPNs for the servers, SQL service accounts for beoth source and destination using name and FQDN. enabled computer name and service accounts for delegation. When I run the following: 

Can anyone tell me what is the Equivalent of SQL 2005's SQLAgentOperatorRole (msdb ) in SQL 2000? I want to grant a login ability to disable a job in SQL 2000. Thanks in advance.... 

We have a Microsoft Access database + application (on Server A) which connects to a remote SQL server (Server B) using System DSN ODBC connection (on Server A) to the SQL database server. The users are open this Access database remotely as it is on a shared location on the server A. They still have to create a local ODBC connection on their computers to connect to Server B. Is there anyway that they can access the Access database and not have to create a local ODBC connection? thanks in advance 

You have to install the Mac Keyboard drivers for Windows. I believe they are available on the MacOS DVD. 

EDIT - Disk space Disk space on both servers is sufficient. MySQL is in /data for bdd1 and in /home for bdd2. 

You should really consider using SquidGuard or something similar. There are blacklists available on the Internet that you can download and use easily. 

I second what ConcernedofTunbridge said. Forget about low end SAN or NAS. The performance will most likely be worse then with regular DAS. If you need fast disk access in DAS, go the SSD route. The performance of SSD beat any hard drive disk by orders of magnitude. 

ZFS is definently what you are looking for. There are many ways it prevents data corruption. The most significative example is it only commits data that has been fully written to disk. This should prevent most, if not all, data corruption. Another way it does this is checksumming, it checks that the data written to disk is correct. This will help in case of power failure when only part of the data gets written to disk. Also, battery backed RAID cards are really a no-brainer... 

fixed- since it was restored daily. i have excluded it from re-index, dbcc checkdb, update stats etc maintenance plans. even though they ran during seperate schedule, excluding the database fixed the issue. 

In SQL 2005 and above, If i dont want to give someone sys admin rights how can the person see Activity monitor and sql server logs? what is the minimum level of rights to see Activity monitor and sql server logs in SQL server? any help? regards Manjot 

Workaround- created seperate counter log. It might be because there are too many counters in that counter log... 

As per BOL the migration component only migrated what it can...not 100%. The client machine had to have ssis installed. and then i used config files. 

solved. One of my friends answered: Start the Server Network Utility. To do this, do one of the following: Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft SQL Server, and then click Server Network Utility. In the Instance(s) on this server list, select your instance of SQL Server. In the Default port box, type a static port number, and then click OK. Note The static port that you specify must differ from the dynamic port that your instance of SQL Server is currently listening on. Restart the instance of SQL Server. From: This article 

Are you sure they are using your webmail ? Webmail is a web interface used to send emails, we agree on that ? I advise you to remove your webmail asap because someone is most likely using some sort of vulnerability in your webmail software. Upgrade it and put it back online. If the spamming continues, try to see which user is sending email and disable their account. Check if someone hasn't inserted a malicious web page that sends out email. I had this exact situation 2 weeks ago. If so, delete it asap and seriously reconsider reinstalling your server. Also, is the webserver local to the webmail ? If so, are you sure you're not an open relay ? There are tests that allow you to test this. Big ISPs only allow the IPs of their clients to send email via their mail servers. If you are not an ISP, you want to force your clients to authenticate (see SASL authentication for Sendmail) or allow specific IP which you know are good. 

If this is on the same server, you should not install more then one HTTP server. You just enable the Apache server to listen on the outside IP adress :-) Installing two HTTP servers on one machine is pretty pointless. If this were a two server setup, then it would be a good idea so that the backend machine is less vulnerable to attacks from the Internet. 

If the temp db drive is unavailable (others system database files are available), how can I trick SQL server 2000 to create new temp db on C: and start up? When trying to start up using from command prompt, it just displays the following and thats it: 

How can I know which edition of SSRS, SSAS and SSIS service is installed on a server? Finding database edition is easy but how to find edition for other SQL services? Any help please? Thanks in advance. 

We have a central management server on which we collect Baselines for remote servers. Baseline includes perfmon counters like logical disk, SQL server buffer manager, physical disk, network interface etc. We save it to a SQL server database. The problem is, it is not collecting data for logical disk for 1 server. To check that there is no problem with counters on this server, I created a server specific baseline to collect only the logical disk counters for this server remotely. It collected counter data just fine. this server specific baseline is running under same credentials as the full baseline. Server specifications: Windows server 2003 R2 standard (64 bit) edition Management Server specifications: Windows server 2003 enterprise edition Any help why it is not working for the full baseline? I have dropped and added the counters manually but it doesn't help. Thanks in advance 

First of all, both providers must use the same virtualization technology. If that is not the case, forget it (or get lucky). Second, you must be able to get the raw image of your VM which should roughly be the weight of all the data in your VM if it's a sparse image or the size of your partition if it's a full image. This image is usually stored on a SAN or NAS at the provider's datacentre. I have never seen this being possible... An alternative could be backup software. I know that there exists software that are capable of backing up an entire OS but I don't have any names in mind. 

There is really no reason why this shouldn't work. You are just running a specific OS on top of XenServer with a specific application that is an iSCSI target. Just to be clear, this is a really bad idea for anything other then a temporary low IO testbed. 

You really should consider DRBD (RAID-1 over TCP/IP) with a multi-node filesystem such as OCFS or GFS. You can also consider getting a SAN on which you will be able to put any one of these filesystems as well.
