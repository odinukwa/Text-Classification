Not really an answer but a sort of "work around". Since the Host OS creating the zip file is a Mac I tried uploading this .zip on a Linux web server I manage, then I unpacked the zip, and the files were correctly named once extracted. So I repacked the files in zip and downloaded on my machine, now all files have the correct names. I'll just leave this here as a quick memorandum, I hope there are are other solutions more practical than this! 

I noticed a weird address in the Local Address column in the Network tab of Process Hacker in lots of program that work with internet connection (like chrome, firefox, dropbox, thunderbird etc..). The address in question is this one: hhbekxxw5d9e.pflexads.com. Most of these preocesses have the same adrress also in the Remote Address column. Some of these send and receive data over the network. I've tried scanning with Malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essential, both with no results. I'm on Windows 7. My file is picked from $URL$ so luckly those requests are blocked, I'm no expert in these things and wondered what is producing this and if it's anything that should not be neglected. Any suggestions? UPDATE It uses small traffic, but it stacks up from time to time: starts with few bytes and then it goes for some KB. Fact that worried me most is that this address is in also 1password process and Teamviewer too. I'm no netowrk expert, but I've tried with Wireshark to filter the recordings with filters on what is listed on the Process Hacker network tab. Unfortunately the output of the filter is blank, wich is kinda odd to me since I can actively see reported in the network tab of Process Hacker that data is going for those processes through those ports. Am I blatantly missing something? 

The above script opens thunderbird, but fails to select a message. Executing just the xdotool command shown above, on the command line, does work, just not in the script. Any suggestions? 

I want to run a script every 5 seconds, but (to conserve resources) only when a specified application is running. Is there a way to do that with crontab? 

Currently using Thunderbird 52.5.0 (64-bit) under Arch. The account settings menu allows you to set the starting folder, and the preferences menu allows you to either enable or disable the "Thunderbird Start Page," but not set default to message text. In order to actually select (and therefore see) the text of the first message of the starting folder, it currently takes three key strokes: n, ctrl+home, up-arrow (if there is new mail, only one stroke, n). Is there a way to force Thunderbird to focus on the first message at startup? Using xdotool in a bash script, you can start thunderbird, then send the command to view the "next" message (as it only requires one keystroke, n). The plan is to use xdotool this way: 

This generates an output of the lines of bash commands, bit it does not actually process them, so how do you make them run in command mode within this same script? UPDATE: The following script generates a file containg each command line: 

The answer provided by Maximus is no longer valid for cmder 1.3+ You have to create a file (for ex. ) inside your cmder folder with your customized definition (source). Below my customization: 

Please check the images below I've attached for better details. On the left side you can see the document layout in InDesign (transparent content is there just to show you what is the entire content placed), on the right side is what can be seen in Acrobat Pro opening the resulting exported pdf file. Notice that this happens placing pdfs and Illustrator files. 

As title goes, is there a script for Win 7 to get printed on a .txt file all the images (JPG, PNG, GIF ecc) inside a folder along with "filename" and "pixels dimension"? I've tried with on command line but only lists name, file size ecc.. 

Have you tried with FileTypesMan from excelent Nirsoft? It's a small application that can allow you to set specific icon per file extension. I think it should be able to change the icon without messing with the default program. 

Ok solution with ImageMagick, simple and quick (but ofc requires the library). Open the cmd line in the folder you are interested (Shift+RightClick inside your folder window and select "Open command window here"), then in the cmd prompt use this 

Can't view the "In-Place Archive” folder within Outlook 2016: The “In-Place Archive” folder is not visible within my local installation of Outlook 2016. The MS tech that assisted with onboarding stated that the folder would take about a week for the folder to appear in outlook after enabling the feature in the admin panel. I'm still waiting for it to appear two months later. After some research, it looks like my plan, Office 365 Business Premium only supports viewing the in-place archive folder in OWA. Apparently you must have the Professional Plus version if want to see the in-place archive folder in BOTH OWA AND Outlook: 

You are referring to the Windows Snap feature (also known as "Aero Snap" in Windows 7). When you have a two monitor display, windows essentially treats both monitors as one, so the "inside" of both monitors is like the "middle" of a single monitor. EDIT: I'm wrong about this - please see the post by Brandon Mitchell for a great tutorial on how to do this. I stand by my recommendations below though :) You could use a 3rd party solution to accomplish the "middle snap" you are trying to achieve. There are many options, but This reddit post has a pretty good list of what's available. Search for "Windows Tiling Software" if you'd like more options. By the way, if you have Windows 10, you can also use 2×2 snapping and vertical snap features here is a good article on using them, and I would be remiss if I didn't mention Virtual Desktops as a potential solution. I create a virtual desktop for each "group" of application windows I'm using for a particular task. For example, Virtual Desktop 1 will have all of my programming applications, while virtual desktop has email & other communications. Switching between them is a breeze with the shortcuts - much faster than have to click around. Good luck! 

I'm creating a template document for a client in Word 2010. I'm trying to implement some instructions in the document, so that if the file is either printed or exported as a .pdf file, those instructions are not available/visible. Comments are quite nice visually speaking, but unfortunately I can't find a way to avoid them to be printed or be visible when exporting the document to .pdf. Is there any way to accomplish this? 

Solution with ExifTool The best deal imo, with the command already coded in the file name of the .exe its totally a drag and drop script to use wherever you want! Update For convenience, I've slightly modified the inline file name of the exe to this 

I received a zip file from a Mac OS user with several hundred of .jpg files, some with very long names. Opening the .zip file wit 7-zip on my Win 7 machine, lots of these files have very weird characters; I guess they were encoded like this in the zipping process. Here is a sample 

What can I do to be sure that "out of frame" content is not present once I export the pdf file? I want "out of frame" content cropped/trimmed/deleted, not clipped. 

This way I've reduced to the minimum the .txt output to a single line per image () and added a recursive option () so that it can process subfolders too.
