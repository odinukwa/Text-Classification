I've been trying to figure out a way to get information on the indexing progress programmatically (how many files to go or "indexing complete"). I stumbled upon the class Win32_PerfFormattedData_WSearchIdxPi_SearchIndexer and was surprised by the number of zeros it showed me, especially the zero next to "IndexSize". 

I would like to install a driver for HP LaserJet 4250n on a Windows 7 machine. The HP site gives me a universal driver which is not what I need. After installing that driver, I have a new icon in Devices and Printers, "HP Universal Printing PCL6". When I choose this "printer" after clicking Ctrl+P, a window opens in which I can input the address of the actual printer I want to use. It does work in that the printer prints the things I need, but it's twice as much clicking as I'd like. Can't I just install a driver for the actual printer I'm using? Where can I find it? 

Has anyone with this VAIO been able to install Windows 7 and have it detect the monitor and graphics adaptor? Am just getting "Standard VGA" for the display, and "Generic Non-PnP" for the Monitor. Resolution is limited to 1024 x 768 as a result. Any ideas? I can't find any drivers that would work. Hints appreciated. 

I currently have AppleScript which runs on a folder and is taking up my machine whilst it's working. I wish to be able to do it without UI interference. Any ideas? Thanks. 

So works like a charm. Although if I just the hostname in any other application within OSX - such as Safari/CoRD, they simply can't resolve the hostname. I have to instead use the FQDN - why is this so? Why did this work in Leopard and is now broken? Would love a solution. Thanks 

I found this because I was looking for an improvement over my startup subst scripts - they worked OK, but sometimes executed after folders crashed on startup because my drive wasn't yet mapped. First, I edited the registry, but was unable to get it to work. However, I did come across this alternative, which although it doesn't use subst does answer for me the question, "How to make SUBST mapping persistent across reboots?" Don't use subst... (insert appropriate 'computerName' and 'pathName'): 

I tried 150%, but this caused unacceptable degradation to fonts in certain programs, such as MATLAB. At 125%, I am unhappy with some of the effects, but it is a fair balance to be able to read my email without zooming on every message. On the other hand it is a big downside to overcome deficiencies in one app, so I think I may just switch to this mode when I have a lot of email to read and then switch back - despite logging off and on twice! 

What is the information these zeros represent? Am I not looking at the right class? If I am, should I do something to get different numbers? This is on Windows 8.1, but the computers I'd actually like to do things like this on are Windows 7 and Windows 10 systems. I'm working from a Windows 10 machine right now, and it looks a bit different. ActiveConnections shows 2 instead of 0 here. I've also noticed that on both computers some of the properties missing in FormattedData, Frequency_Sys100NS, are shown in RawData: RawData: 

And here's an example of what the Search Indexer performance counters look like in mmc.exe (this is again on the Windows 10 computer, but it looks the same on the the Windows 8.1 computer). It's just a vertical line moving across the screen - the counter is Index Size in this case. 

*For many applications, these are poor choices for long term use. They do allow you to observe the behavior of filling and rotating the logs more quickly than large logs do. Finally, don't forget to nohup if required! With nohup, you do not need the (s=10e6 and n=30 here): 

I like for my use case, but my use case is so trivial/simple that it is not laid out very simply in the docs/examples I found. Here is a simple multilog rotate example: 

I am eager to know how others deal with this, since I don't understand the workaround that I fumbled through (which I'll list if it does not come up in answers). 

In my experience, variations in script or executable behavior often result from environment (PATH, etc.). For this reason, I highly recommend using a wrapper script to configure the environment for the script or executable of interest and then use to test execution of the wrapper. It can also help to strip the environment before configuring any required environment variables in the wrapper script. This is also useful for cron, Jenkins, Rundeck, and many other ways of invoking scripts or executables. 

I wish to retain the 'Open "safe" files after downloading' check box, as it contains things like images and pdf's that I do want to automatically open using Preview. Although am sick of downloading MP3 files which are automatically added to iTunes and are immediately played back. Anyway to stop this behaviour for JUST mp3's? Thank you. 

Check out $URL$ Once you've mounted several NFS machines, IF that's what you're after, then you can present them through a single logical volume. 

If you navigate using the terminal to the directory containing your VM: $ ls -lha you should see some "name-SnapshotX" (where X denotes how many times you've taken a snapshot) files. You CAN delete these, but not recommended. As far as resizing your HDD. VMware Converter (Windows only) is the best way of doing this due to the automated partition adjustment. As if you do it manually (by adding more through Fusion HDD dialog), you'll just have a large drive, with a lot of empty space, which your Windows will not recognise, and then you'll have to muck around with partition resizing internally. Hope that helps. Cheers. 

What does this even mean? How should we deal with it? In this case, qfdevelopment_metapkg is an apt package that contains only dependencies in order to install the necessary packages prior to performing development for the qf project. I had installed the package (originally) using: 

Now, after installing, the presence of this script causes the apt/deb system to keep the package instead of automatically causing it to disappear. Alternate workaround - without editing deb A different workaround - that does not require modifying the deb - is to just install again at the end to get things squared away: 

I am shocked that there isn't a better answer for Outlook 2010 on Windows 7, so I will be checking back. What I settled on is pretty poor: using the "Make it easier to read what's on your screen" feature in Windows 7 and setting an overall magnification to 125%. Unfortunately, you have to log off and log back in in order to see the effect, which makes it a pain to experiment. This feature is accessed in Windows 7 by right-clicking on the desktop, selecting "Screen resolution", and then clicking "Make text and other items larger or smaller" near the bottom. There is also an option to "Set custom text size (DPI)", but I didn't take the time to try it out. You can also access this dialog by typing "Make it easier to read" into the control panel search. 

I'm an L2 helpdesk guy and I have a user whose Lenovo L440 will not connect to wifi. The wifi icon in the notification area shows a red X and the "turn wireless on" button is greyed out in the Mobility Center. When she presses F8, it shows that wifi is on. The adapter is enabled and "allow to turn off to save power" is unchecked. We've reinstalled Pro/Set Wireless, and tried to install the adapter driver from the Device Manager. When I uninstalled the device there, checking the "remove driver" checkbox, it did not find the driver in Windows Update and I had to install Pro/Set Wireless from the Intel website. I've reinstalled the Hotkey Features Integration package and the Power Management driver. I've queried the software and hardware radio states using Managed Wifi and it shows that the hardware switch is off. Now, L440 does not have a hardware switch on the outside. The Windows troubleshooter is saying the same thing: check an external switch. Which there isn't. So my question to the knowledgeable SuperUsers is: how is this possible? The case is out of my hands now (local IT will be doing their magic), but I would like to understand what's happening because these tickets are relatively common. It's usually not as difficult to resolve them as here but we definitely do need more understanding of how this works. I'm probably asking a lot but perhaps there is someone here who can explain how exactly Windows determines the value of PhyRadioState[0].dot11HardwareRadioState and how it can be off when no physical hardware switch is present. And I would simply appreciate any light shed on this. 

I adapted this from Hank Arnold's suggestion at this discussion of mapping local drives. I had guessed that \\myComputerName\c might work, but I didn't know to apply the $. Before you try the "net use" command, try to navigate to to make sure you have 'computerName' correct. 

John T's accepted answer (GNU screen, accessed with ) was what I needed, but I needed a few minutes learning some basics to make it useful. Here is the jump start I needed on key bindings (straight from the man page) - note that you need to install the GNU version for vertical splits (listed after the FAU version that was in my Mavericks). Also, I highly recommend you skim to see what suits your needs. You can always just launch another terminal using screen and then read the manual... Screen version 4.00.03 (FAU) 23-Oct-06 (included in Mavericks and likely similar in earlier) 

which simply takes all logon sessions. And again, it's like I haven't logged on at all: User LogonTime ---- --------- mycomputername\IUSR 1/22/2016 12:07:50 AM mycomputername\SYSTEM 1/22/2016 12:07:09 AM mycomputername\LOCAL SERVICE 1/22/2016 12:07:11 AM mycomputername\NETWORK SERVICE 1/22/2016 12:07:10 AM mycomputername\ANONYMOUS LOGON 1/22/2016 12:08:03 AM My actual username is not shown... Why could that be? What can I do to get to see my logon session? 

I'm writing a program one of whose functions is to get the current logon sessions on a Windows computer. It queries WMI for the current sessions with logon type 2 (interactive), logon type 10 (remote interactive) and logon type 11 (cached interactive). The code I have works OK, except for one thing I just noticed. When I was testing it in my work domain environment, everything was fine, but now that I'm at home and logged on outside of our work network, I'm not getting any sessions at all -- and I thought I would get my logon session as a cached interactive session. So I've tested it with this PS code taken from this website:
