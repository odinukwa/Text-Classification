THERE IS A MISTAKE IN THE SCHEMATIC: I am using a NPN transistor not a PNP My code (or at least the important part of it) is shown below: 

You can use with a cronjob. This is what I do when I need to run something in the background at boot. To do this, you will need to install with the command: 

This is the more widely used solution, as with a USB sound card you can use a microphone. You can pick one up for less than $5 on eBay and Amazon. 

Like @Milliways said, you will need to run the command then navigate to and then and select no. Then reboot and you should be set. 

If surround sound directly from alsa is what you need, I suggest taking a look at this article: $URL$ The article also covers JACK. 

This waits 60 seconds after the boot to run the script. You may need to wait longer or shorter depending on how fast your boot is. Time your boot and change the to the appropriate time in seconds. 

I have seen videos of people folding/creasing these types of cables. (Source) But I do not know if this is okay to do with the RPi Camera's cable. Could this do harm to the cable and cause it to not work or be unreliable? The reason I need to fold/crease it is because I have a project in which a Pi Zero is almost touching the walls of it's casing, so the cable only has about 0.5cm of space between the Pi and the wall. EDIT: At about 1:50 in this video he states to not make kinks in the cable, but he does not provide any reason for this. 

Are there any GUIs for Mariadb on the Raspberry Pi besides phpmysql? I'm hoping for something that's as easy to install as 

When I ran a Pi 3 on 2.0 amps, it ran, but I got the lightning bold on the upper right corner telling me it was under powered. When I used a a 2.5 amp adapter, that lightning bolt went away and everything worked. When I tried to run the Pi 3 from a 1.0 amp adapter, it booted up, but stopped after 3 seconds. I don't think the Pi 3 could power another Pi 3. 

One problem you'll run into is making php play the song without timing out. node.js can serve up web pages as well as run omxplayer in a separate thread. It handles multithreading in an unusual way. Everything is multithreaded except your javascript code. I once programmed a Raspberry Pi to yell Shut Up! as a joke when I accessed it remotely using a browser from another room on port 8000: 

Adafruit.com sells the Adafruit RFM95W LoRa Radio Transceiver Breakout - 868 or 915 MHz for $20. They can easily go 2 Km line of sight using simple wire antennas, or up to 20Km with directional antennas and settings tweakings 

I am using a TTL to USB cable with my Raspberry Pi and I would like to forward that UART signal over the internet, or just over my own network via a usb to wifi chip of some sort. How would I go about doing this? What port would it be over? How would I access it via Macbook? Yes, I am aware of ssh this is for debugging when my Pi does not boot far enough to turn on wifi.

There are better ways than that for turning on and off light bulbs. Like using relays: $URL$ Or Arduino: $URL$ 

Now, to set the device to your default card you will need to edit the file with the command scroll down until you find the lines 

Like @SteveRobillard stated in his comment, it's probably best just to buy the powered hub first and save you the possible trouble of not having it in the first place if you needed it. 

I have come across a very peculiar problem. I have a Raspberry Pi Zero V1.3 running Raspbian Jessie Lite on a 64 GB SanDisk micro SD card. The Pi is powered via the micro USB port (not the OTG port obviously) and the cable it is powered with can be switched on/off. When I switch the cable on, the Pi's USB ports will become powered, as my Wifi dongle or serial adapter will turn on, the 5v and 3v3 pins will become powered, but the ACT led will not turn on or flash or anything. Turn it off, and back on again, and everything works fine, the ACT led flashes and the Pi boots fine. If I do a and switch the power off, wait a minute, and switch it back on, it will not boot. Switch it off, then back on, and it will. It will only boot every other time. What can I do to fix this? Is there a reason for this happening? Could it be caused by the fact that I'm using a 64 GB card, and not a â‰¤32 GB card? I've seen other people use this size (and larger) card and have it work fine. Later tonight I will (reluctantly) reformat the card with a complete overwrite method, and see if it works. 

Sometimes people try to hack into your computer from the internet. People (even foreign governments) scan every ip address looking for computers listening on known ports such as 21, 22, and 80. From my experience, it takes about ten minutes on the internet before somebody starts to try to hack into your pi. They try to log in with many different common passwords and sometimes crash the service. I recommend changing ports 21 and 22 to something else. Edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, and change the line with 'Port 22' to 'Port 2022' (or add that line if it's not there) While you're there, make sure that 'PermitRootLogin' is set to 'no' reload the sshd config (/etc/init.d/ssh reload), and you should be able to log in on port 2022 from now on. Changing the ports to different numbers means someone would have to do a port scan to find the open ports. Configure your router to block and detect port scans. But I dont know how to turn off the government back door in your router. I don't have instructions on how to change port 21 because I use ftp over ssh. 

Once booted, the command will be running in the background, if you want to attach it and watch/interact with it, you will need to enter the command: 

The Pi's standard baudrate is 115200, while most modules are 9600, and some are different, make sure you are using the correct baudrate. 

I needed to install the newest Raspbian for it to work, both Jessie and Jessie Lite worked. But I had to format the card from scratch. would not work. 

The Raspberry Pi needs a special driver for Xbox 360 controller compatibility. To download this driver, enter the command . RetroPie should immediately recognize the controller's input. This is a good tutorial for this as well: $URL$ 

Turn the Pi over and look for the square solder point. That is pin 1. Pin 1 is the pin closest to the PWR led. 

I am purchasing another RPi because my original is broken, but not entirely, so I would like to chain them together via and ethernet cable. Each Pi will also have access to the internet via wifi, but can I take the wifi adapter out of the first and use ssh via the local connection made by the ethernet cable? Is there any software I need for this, and how whould I go about doing this?
