If you are referring to computer systems that allow for open public Internet surfing, I would recommend following these links... $URL$ $URL$ The first will get you started downloading Boothbox. A Free Open Source Internet Kiosk. The second link is a post I wrote with a guide I wrote to help one work with Boothbox. My actual document is missing from my website, but I will try to correct it tonight. 

So according to Cisco's website, yes you can have your 877 be a server. But I would highly recommend against it. I setup a VPN solution with the 871 routers connecting to a head end 2800 router and had all kinds of problems. Lower end devices just are not made to handle a lot of simultaneous VPN connections. My recommendation would be to buy a 2800 or 3800 series router with a VPN module. The hardware module will allow for more connections, but will also handle the connections a lot better. How you want to set it all up and where to put your head end is up to you, but I think having the head end sit on the outside of your network just as your 877 does today is probably the easiest. In the links below you will find a lot of ways to do this, but the easiest is to use a head-end like you have now, but with beefier hardware. Take out the spaces for those links and search the second one for "Easy VPN". $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

But I want to mount the share depending of the OU of the user. In example, if a user logs in machine1 and he belows to OU=marketing: 

I have a directory structure in a shared folder with specific folder permissions for making projects in a Active Directory Domain like \server\shared\Projects\Project1, \server\shared\Projects\Project2, \server\shared\Projects\Project3... There is no user that have full permissions on the projects folder and I have created a script to set the permissions, but only a user with full permissions like the AD domain can execute the script (a .ps1 or a .vbs) and set them I was thinking if a web server with AD authentication can do the work. A user with privileges logs into the web with the credentials, give a name for the project and push a button, in the server side a script is running that create the folder wiht right permissions and returns the output to the web. How can I start? Is there a better way to do this? 

I have a Microsoft Windows domain and I want to add the ubuntu machines with Likewise-Open. There is no problem with that, but in my windows machines I have a GPO that mount a net share depending of the OU of the user that makes login into machine. I want to have the same with the ubuntu machines and I think that maybe it can be done with pam_mount.conf.xml file I have this configuration: 

In case this helps other people, I have a Synology NAS and the NFS point actually added another item to the path. I was trying to mount "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/folder" as this is what I do in Windows. But for Ubuntu with NFS I had to use "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/volume1/folder". 

If anyone is interested in experimenting, just use Wireshark. If someone really gets on our case about slow connectivity or dropped packets we just mirror a port on a switch, connect up a laptop with Wireshark and take a look. 

So the initiating server was able to connect at one point and now all of the sudden it cannot? And the only thing you know that has changed is the initiating server has file services installed? Could perhaps a default setting been changed? I know that on server 2008 systems there is some setting to allow remote desktop connections for older remote desktop connection applications from older systems. Is there a setting to allow you to remote connect to older remote desktop connection systems? Has anything changed on the 2003 system? Can you verify it can accept connections? Try to initiate the connection from another host. For instance do you have an XP client or another server 2003 system you could attempt to initiate the connection from? If that works then the issue would likely exists on the server 2008 system. If not, then it is either an issue with the server 2003 system on the other side of the tunnel or a network issue. 

I'm building an IT infrastructure for managing all the workstations in my company. I am interested in Puppet and a external node classifier as The Foreman, but I see all the time that Puppet and The Foreman is based for servers, is there any reason to not use Puppet and The Foreman for workstations? It is insane to manage about 1000 worksations or more with this configuration? Thank you 

I have on account and I don't want to give it Administrator permissions, only to create OU, users, and groups. The trouble is that Accounts Operator can't create OU, how can I add a group for this purpose? Or can I change the permissions of Accounts Operator group? The domain is made with Windows Server 2003. 

I want to make two things: First of all, I want to have my own repository of ubuntu in my servers to not overload the usage of Internet in my company and to control the updates. I think that I have to use apt-mirror And also I want to add my own packages to the repository. What is the best way to do this? Do I have to have two repositories? One with the mirror and another one with my packages? In case of conflict with my packages how Ubuntu solve this? Thank you 

I have one Windows 2003 DHCP Server, with one NIC in the subnet 192.168.40.x and I want to serve IPs from two differents subnets 192.168.40.x and 192.168.178.x. Now, I have the subnet 192.168.40.x full but the Server is not giving adresses from the other subnet. It is possible to do the server work with only one NIC? My setup is this: Windows 2003 Server [192.168.40.x] · Scope [192.168.40.x] full Router 192.168.40.x Broadcast Adress 192.168.40.255 DNS Server 192.168.40.x, 192.168.178.x · Scope [192.168.178.x] empty Router 192.168.178.x Broadcast Adress 192.168.178.255 DNS Server 192.168.40.x, 192.168.178.x 

Routing and firewall seems a little too high level for this issue. You say servers connected on the same switch will ping, but ones connected to other switches do not. I would say you need to trunk your VLANs on the switches. Check all your trunks and make sure that the necessary VLANs are added. If you run VTP, make sure you added the new lab VLAN to VTP using the VTP server. The reason I do not think its a routing issue is because if two devices exist in different networks they always have to talk to a gateway before they can talk to each other. Doesn't matter if they are connected to the same switch or not. So in the case of the server and lab computer, they are in different VLANs. So if one tries to ping the other, that ping has to go up to a layer 3 address first (the gateway) before the ping will respond. The OP states that a ping from the lab computer to the server on the same switch works fine, so routing should not be an issue. 

What I'm getting at, 90% of my servers have something like HP DL380 Gen7,8,9 or HP DL380 G7,8,9. That is standard names I'm used to. But a a few follow a name like HP DL380R07 or DL380R05 or something like that. The "R0" is throwing me off. And these product names dont have "Gen" or "G" in the name which is what I'm used to. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I'm hoping this is the right place to ask...
