The Cisco 88VA SEC/K9 has Advance Security as default feature set and so supports IPsec VPN (see table 3 and 4 in this datasheet) 

Those are for the slot, subslot and port number. This is mainly used by (and come from) Cisco routers, which are modular. Those routers can have different cards inserted into a slot, so the final numbering will depend on the type of card inserted. From sunsetlearning.com 

You can use VLAN to separate your 3 networks, but with only the EKI-7656C switch, which is layer 2 only, you have no way to allow the Modbus connection between the VLAN To do so you need a router or a firewall that will perform inter-VLAN routing and filter which traffic is allowed between the 3 VLANs. Another way would be to have the modbus device multi-homed, I.E. having a separate interface in each network, but this require those devices to have several interfaces, and it is not recommended (this would somewhat break the isolation between the networks). 

MX, CNAME, PTR, and NS records point to hostnames. A records point to IP addresses. Putting an IP address in an NS record is a pretty common DNS misconfiguration. One reason is that you might have NS records pointing to servers outside of your domain for someone doing secondary DNS for you. That remote domain might change the IP address of the server (but leave the hostname alone). 

Since you say you see no capabilities, there is no "route refresh" capability being advertised so there is no choice but to reset the BGP session in order to effect the change in routing policy. References: 

You can configure a Palo Alto Networks firewall to fail over to the other ISP. You need to set up two sets of NATs -- one for one ISP and one for the other -- or set two DMZs, one for one ISP and one for the other (or overlay two subnets on one interface). It will use both for inbound and will fail over to the second for outbound when one fails. You can start reading here. 

This is not the hosts that decide which route a packet will follow, each router in the path make it's own decision. (Actually, the originating host could use the IP strict source option to force the packets to go through a specific route, but it's rarely, if ever, used, and it's totally ignored by routers on the Internet) So each router can change the router of packets depending on the network condition (link drop, congestion on a link, load balancing...) What a host can decide is to alter it's TCP window (flow control), to modify the rate at which it sends information, but this doesn't impact routing. Except for Policy Based Routing, routing is a layer 3 decision that doesn't take into account layer 4 (TCP / UDP) information, so it's performed in the same way for TCP / UDP / ICMP etc... 

The most basic topology you can build involving a router is Host A -- Interface 0 [Router] Interface 1 -- Host B If you set: Host A 

It is to prevent routing loops due to bad practice or configuration errors. Example: Jackweasel.COM is single-homed to some transit provider Victim.NET who has assigned them a private ASN, say 65000. Someone at Jackweasel.COM decides to initiate a peering session with Clueless.ORG who has a public ASN, and has agreed to peer with Jackweasel using the private ASN that Jackweasel has (it would surprise you how many people would not notice off that bat that they are setting up a peering session with someone who is using a private ASN and might also peer with someone else). Now Jackweasel announces routes learned from Clueles to Victim. Victim will now keep that full path in its route announcements to prevent a loop just like it does with regular BGP announcements using public ASNs. Basically it is a matter of "someone is multihomed with a private ASN so I now have to treat the path the same as I do with public ASNs to prevent routing loops in other networks". It also might break connectivity to the announced routes for everyone else on the planet using that same private ASN. You might also be surprised at how many people accept routes with their own ASN because their network is not fully meshed. They have a colo in Virginia and one in California and they are each announcing a different /24 using the same ASN so they allow announcements carrying their own ASN to be installed so the two colos can talk to each other. But it also helps protect the Jackweasel who did this because they now see THEIR own private ASN in route announcements from Clueless (and who knows how many other peers they might have set up that way) that they sent to Victim. 

This shows me disk0, which I am assuming is the SSD, but is there a way I can get more information about the SSD? 

I have to set up a connection from a BIDI SFP to a unidirectional SFP. Any idea how this i even possible? is there an intermediary device that can aggregate the Tx and Rx of one fibre and output only into one line? 

I know the file is available, and it can see it because when i change the file name in the command (put in a non-existent file), it says no such file or directory exists. I have tried it the other way around as well (from the server to the rotuer) but I get instead. This is extremely frustrating as there is no documentation on this error. EDIT: The FTP is between the Juniper router and a Linux server. I also tried going down to the file name itself: 

I can't figure out why you are running two instances of OSPF on the the 2900's. This looks way more complicated than it needs to be. You can run OSPF in passive mode on the firewall and distribute a default route from the 2900's. You put a static route on the 2900's for your /24 pointed at your firewall outside IP. Since this is active/standby, if the firewall fails over, the IP address moves with the active firewall. There really is no need to announce anything from the firewall, it is just listening for a default. If you are announcing a default, there is really no need for HSRP either, that can go away. The firewall will just send the traffic to where it hears the default. It might well load balance to both 2900's, though. Seems you are making it a lot more complicated than it needs to be. There is only ONE firewall address in this configuration so a static route will work just fine. Even so, there is no need for more than one OSPF instance and the only thing you are using that for is to handle the case where a router dies. Then the firewall uses the remaining path where it hears the remaining default route. 

So each implementation is free to use the broadcast address or not. RFC826 is updated by RFC 5227, but it doesn't change this: 

You just need to wait for the port to goes in forwarding mode. By default on Cisco switches (and it seems in packet tracer), when a port goes UP, the STP process block the port until it determines that the network is loop-free, by listening for BPDU on this port. To avoid this you can configure ports that are connected to hosts (I.E. not other switches) with the command. This will cause the port to goes in forwarding mode immediately upon connection, but still run STP discovery and block the port if a loop is detected. 

In OSPF the network statement is used to configure which interface will participate in the OSPF process (I.E on which interface to send and listen for Hello packets) This is done by comparing the value of the network statements (in ospf configuration) versus the network configured on all of the routers interface. The network configured in ospf doesn't have to be an exact match to the network configured on the interface. The latter can be a subnet. For example: 

All data bits flow at exactly the same speed down the wire (the speed of light in the medium of travel). So a bit of data travelling 1000 miles down a 10 meg circuit arrives at the other end at exactly the same time as a bit travelling down a 100Gig connection. The difference is the RATE at which the signal can transition state between 1 and 0. The faster you can transition the state of the signal, the faster you can send the next bit. So -- basically there is no such thing as "speed" because it all operates at the same speed (the speed of light), what differs is the RATE of data bits you can send. That is the "bandwidth". The faster I am able to flip the state of the signal from 1 to 0 and back again, the more data I can send in a given amount of time. Imagine two signalmen using old time semaphore flags. One signals quickly, one signals slowly. The actual light reaching your eye is arriving at the same speed in both cases but one can send a lot more data in a given time than the other. That signalman has more bandwidth and can send more data in a given period of time. The data doesn't travel faster, but that one can pack more data into a given slice of time. 

Has anyone successfully used FTP on a Juniper Device. reading their documentation, the method of using it is: 

Since there aren't many resources out there regarding virtual rendezvous protocol, my basic understanding of it seems very similar to BGP. Which basically had me questioning why the protocol even exists. Can anyone please explain VRP, and how it differs from BGP? 

Is there a way to check the current interface output/input rate on Cisco devices? the interface statistics only give the average over 5 minutes, and monitoring the interface seems to have a very long lag (as it also only shows the updated value over 5 minutes). When I do a show interface on a Juniper device, it gives the current input/output rate.. is there a way to do this on a Cisco device? 

From the way I understand it, Source based RTBH ($URL$ works on the principle that only if the routing entry for the IP address is present, it will allow the packet through. My understanding is that if I initiate the connection to 123.123.123.123 (which is on the internet) then the response will be allowed to enter as the FIB will see that the request was actually initiated from my end (hopefully this is a correct understanding). My question is that at any given time.. someone will always be on Google, or Wikipedia. So how can one prevent an attack from someone who is spoofing their IP and using the IP of a large organisation such as Google or Wikipedia. If my understanding is correct, If I initiate the connection to Google, then the response will be allowed in (as the FIB will see that I sourced it), but how would it know that it was someone impersonating Google that is re-entering. 

It will work. You will get more loss at the splice than if you were splicing like fiber but you can do it. You can even mix the fiber types in longer runs. Reference: Mixing of G655 and G652 Fibers in a Network 

As long as you are fully meshed and the you can backhaul your own traffic arriving at one site but destined to the other, sure, it will work. So if your peering session drops with either ISP, your more specific will be withdrawn (you HOPE!) and the traffic will flow to the aggregate route on the other ISP and you can then backhaul the traffic to the other site. The most frustrating problem I see is network providers that advertise unreachable routes. Either through some screwup internally or whatever, they announce a route to their peers that they can not actually reach inside their network. There isn't much of a workaround for those cases. As for the F5 handing reply traffic back via the interface on which it was received, most load balancers can do that. I don't specifically know if the F5 will but I know Citrix Netscaler will and A10 will so it seems to be a rather standard feature.
