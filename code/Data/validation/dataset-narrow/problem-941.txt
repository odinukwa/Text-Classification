This has been a feature request in Ubuntu for a while now. As of yet their is no official support, but there is a work around: a) Export to PDF in OpenOffice. b) Use pdfnup to print multiple pages per sheet. 

I been trying to convert my HTML file to MediaWiki format by exporting it using OpenOffice. I keep getting this error message though: 

I've had this problem on my laptop for sometime now. Anytime I try to use my touchpad it works correctly about 60% of the time in Windows, the other 40% of the time, it will jump to a random spot on the screen. It has had this problem in Windows XP, Vista, and 7! I did clean installs of each OS. Now heres where it gets weird, when I switch to Ubuntu 9.04, my touchpad works fine 100% of the time. Is there some way I can fix this? 

It could be that one of the ports is USB 2.0 and the other is USB 1.0 or 1.1 USB 2.0 is the newer technology and it supports faster rates of transfer. 

I recently bought a Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 and it has one minor annoyance: It continues to dim the screen when I unplug it from the power cord. I have tried setting the screen brightness in the advanced power settings but no matter what I set this to, the laptop always gets dimmer when unplugged. 

I'm trying to install my wireless drivers (which uses a broadcom card). I tried to install them using the restricted drivers offered on my Ubuntu CD (since my only internet connection is public Wi-Fi). However when I clicked activate it got about halfway through the install process before it gave me this error message: 

I really hate the Google Chrome Dev warning that opens every time I use Google Chrome on Linux. Is there anyway to disable it. 

Create a folder in your home directory (ie. ) called and paste all fonts there. This should work since it's ubuntu based but I'm not 100% sure. 

It will turn my screen off, then back on. So I'm thinking that maybe my script isn't getting called. 

BABUN: You should take a look at Babun! I'm a Linux guy and this is the first program I install on my Windows machines. It's a very nice redux of cygwin and installing it is as simple as any other .msi installer. By default the shell is zsh, which I love, but you can easily change that to bash and bash comes preinstalled with Babun as well. 

I'm running Ubuntu 9.04 and when listening to music I usually just turn the volume up and down with the buttons on my PC. Tonight however, I found out that my headphones I've had for 3 years broke (only the right speaker was working because of a short), so I open volume control and adjusted it so that it would send all sound to the right speaker. Now whenever I play music without my headphones and try to change the volume with the buttons on my computer it does absolutely nothing. Is there a way I can reset the default values for the volume control? 

The Windows Vista and Windows 8 boot loaders should now be each on their own partition where they belong. To get rid of the boot menu one has to delete the Windows 8 menu entries from the Vista BCD and the Vista entry from the Windows 8 BCD, as and don't seem to work on their own. This can be done easily with EasyBCD. Another thing to keep in mind, most of the Windows boot fix tools will work only on the partition with the boot flag set and do not allow to operate on a different partition. Thus one needs to ensure with that the boot flag is set for the proper partition. This caused most of my confusion in the process, as even tools like EasyBCD would constantly try to operate on the wrong drive (i.e. the Windows 8 partition was marked bootable, needed to reset that to the first partition). If everything is done should properly detect both Windows partitions and be able to boot into each directly without the Windows boot menu. 

I am searching for an encrypted filesystem for Linux that can be mounted in a write-only mode, by that I mean you should be able to mount it without supplying a password, yet still be able to write/append files, but neither should you be able to read the files you have written nor read the files already on the filesystem. Access to the files should only be given when the filesystem is mounted via the password. The purpose of this is to write log files or similar data that is only written, but never modified, without having the files themselves be exposed. File permissions don't help here as I want the data to be inaccessible even when the system is fully compromised. Does such a thing exist on Linux? Or if not, what would be the best alternative to create encrypted log files? My current workaround consists of simply piping the data through , which works, but is very cumbersome, as you can't easily get access to the filesystem as a whole, you have to pipe each file through manually. 

I want to copy files securely from one computer to another, the other computer however isn't trusted and I don't have direct access to it other then giving the owner of the computer instructions. In addition to that this is a one-time only situation, so any cumbersome setup should be avoided. What would be the easiest and most portable way to do it? What I have in mind would be a program with the following workflow: 

I would suggest you install (available from the Grub boot menu after installation) and check if your memory is alright. 

This might need to be done from a Windows Installation disc in recovery mode. Fourth step, boot with the Windows recovery disc and let it repair the Windows Vista boot or do it manually with: 

I have two (or more) video files that I want to play side by side. I could do that simply by opening them in two seperate windows, but that would also seperate all the controls (play/pause/forward/...). I want to play them in a synchronized fashion so that pause/forwarding/... works on both videos simultaneously so that they always stay at the same timecode and they don't go out of sync. How would I accomplish that in Linux? This is needed for viewing only, so compositing them into a new video file first should be avoided if possible, but if there isn't an easy way to do that, I welcome answers doing it with composition as well. 

I just wanted to update this: Google has now added about 30 new themes to their page, under the artist tab. Some are really good, some aren't but at least we have more choices. 

Which I placed in a folder called: and titled the script , but it doesn't seem to get called after standby. If I just type: 

Everytime I start Ubuntu I get a warning message that says my hard disk is failing. Big deal, it's just a warning, I'm a programmer, I ignore warnings (kidding). On a more serious note: I've already backed up all my data that I need, but I gonna continue to use this computer until it explodes dag napbit! So how do I tell Ubuntu that I don't care and make it stop showing me the warning? 

I would try installing the Synaptiks touchpad tool. This solved my issue when my touchpad wasn't recognized on my laptop. 

Is there a way to hook up a standard DVD player to a DirecTV HD DVR and record the content to this disk? If not is there a way to record the content onto a computer to later be recorded onto a DVD. 

Is there anyway I can change a shortcut key that an application has under one of it's menus in Ubuntu. For example I'm running and want it to clear the window when I press CtrlL. 

I have the airline plugin installed for vim and no matter which theme I pick there is always an orange arrow in the bottom right corner of the screen. How can I fix this? 

I'm just wondering if there are any unofficial Google Chrome Themes that I can easily install (eg. don't have to copy a .dll to the themes folder)? I would like to be able to click apply theme (just like you can on Google's Official Themes page). Do any exist? 

One way you could do this would be to create a folder full of shortcuts to these locations. Then pin the shortcut to the taskbar. Remember to change the shortcut icon before you pin it to the taskbar. 

It is not possible to downgrade from a fresh Windows 10 install as you only have a license for Windows 10 and not Windows 8.1. The only time it is possible to downgrade is if you upgraded from a previous Windows installation. 

When opening/saving a file using GEdit you see a open/save file dialog. The default location to open/save files in is . Is there anyway I can change it so that the default open/save is ? 

Such a tool does exist, it's called Timeshift. The linked article is about Ubuntu but it works for multiple distros. 

It's most likely not a virus written by a scriptkiddie. Viruses are sort of hard to write for *nix (not to say it can't be done). Does it turn off or just log off? If it turns off you might check to see if your computer is overheating. Edit: Try disabling Desktop Effects (Compiz). Ubuntu doesn't want to play nicely with ATI graphics cards. I had a problem with resuming from standby only to find out that Ubuntu was forgetting to tell my screen to turn back on because of my graphic card. 

It should print events to the screen when it gets data. is part of the package in Ubuntu. Neither of these will make your Barcode scanner work, but they will allow you to figure out where the problem is. If works, but doesn't, then you have to tweak your Xorg.conf and manually add it as extra keyboard, if neither works then its a Kernel driver problem. 

If you just need it once in a while, not permanently like you get with , and the solution isn't flexible enough, you can also use good old bash scripting: 

Are you sure the content of authorized_keys is correct? Maybe something went wrong when creating the file. To fix that try removing the file and then use: 

Possible hardware damage aside, how safe your data is really depends on the file system you use and unlike the popular myth journalling file systems aren't a cure for data loss, they can be quite the opposite. The reason for this is journalling itself just means that the integrity of your filesystem is protected, it does not mean that the integrity of your data is protected. With XFS on Linux for example you have a very large window between when your application writes the data and when the data actually hits the disk, if something happens in between the data is gone. That by itself wouldn't be all that bad, but combined with a few quirks of what POSIX allow in terms of filesystem semantics you get into situations where when an application replace an old config file with a new one you have no guarantee that in the case of a crash either of the files survives. Instead you may end up with a 0 bytes file. And this isn't a one in a million accident, it basically happens on every second crash on your average desktop system to some random config file (the .gconf database is an easy victim). Other filesystems, like ext3, don't suffer from the issue, as either their semantics are a little different or they have a much smaller cache window. Early versions of Ext4 and reiserfs suffered this to, but have been fixed in the meantime. Long story short: data that is already on your disk and doesn't get touched will survive, data that however is modified can easily get wiped when you use the wrong filesystem, while its pretty safe with others. 

If both paths refer to the local filesystem (even when one of them is a network filesystem), rsync can't use its delta transfer and will transfer the full file. 

I have a Microsoft Ergonomic 4000 keyboard and I am running a custom keymap (dvorak with some stuff for umlauts): 

I have a tar file that I want to split into multiple smaller tar files. This would be easy with , but I want the splitted files to be fully usable tar files themselves, which can't do as it will split at arbitrary points, not at file boundaries. So how to split a tar file into smaller parts at file boundaries, so that no file ends up being half in one tar and half in the other tar? Solutions that don't use tar and accomplish the task by other means would be welcome as well. PS: Yes, there will be cases where this isn't possible (tar with files larger then the split size).
