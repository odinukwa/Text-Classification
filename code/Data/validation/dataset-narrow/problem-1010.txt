Good afternoon all: Here is the relevant infrastructure setup I'm using: Modem--->Router-->Router (192.168.1.1)-->wireless bridge (ddwrt; static 192.168.1.254)-->Proxmox Server (static 192.168.1.101) On this server, there are two virtual bridges - vmbr0 which is bridged to eth0 (the port used to connect the server to the wireless bridge) and vmbr1 - which is configured as blank. On this proxmox server, I currently have three VMs - Centos7, debian stable box, and a pfsense-2.4.x install. The pfsense box is configured as follows: vtnet0 = virtual nic attached to vmbr0 (bridged to eth0 which is uplink for entire server) vtnet1 = virtual nic attached to vmbr1 (no configuration for this vswitch vmbr1) WAN = vtnet0 (virtual nic attached to the bridged connection to eth0 which connects upstream) WAN: IPv4/DHCP: (192.168.1.* address from upstream router's DHCP) LAN = vtnet1 (virtual nic attached to virtual switch without configuration on proxmox host); LAN = IPv4 STATIC 172.16.0.1/12 

X-axis will be time (year1q1-year2q4). Y-axis will be your cost ($, Euro, Rubles, whatever). You can do business units by color (e.g. all RED are X, BLUE is Y, GREEN is A, YELLOW is B, ORANGE is C, Black is aggregate. You can then either make three sets of these charts (one for each type of cost), or you could aggregate the costs and do line shading by % (e.g. very light green = cost 1 for green group, medium shaded green = cost 2, etc.). As someone with a bit of a background in econometrics: Sometimes conveying a lot of datapoints takes a loooot more than one graph - and even then a lot of your graphs may need... interpretation in the slides. Good luck! 

From the graphical point of view, the recovery mode does not start graphical driver (named modules in Linux) which is often loaded by the non-started graphical service. Instead, it uses limited generic graphic console features which requires no specific module. Graphical modules are big and complex, and can crash your computer when they misbehave. If you experience issue with them, then you will love recovery mode which will let you fix it using a reliable environment. Recovery mode compares with optional kernel parameter , or whichever is the specific run level you want to join instead of the default one. 

In my case I have two results being and and in fact the first is a dependency for the second which is the module to use. Load it this way (with root privileges): 

Since this is Javascript, you can of course create and use private helper functions and variables. Further reading You will find a bunch of documentation over the Internet. Among others: 

Taking the example of a graphical interface on which you double-clic an executable icon, you have your executable forked from the process showing the icon you clicked on with basically this source code: 

with the field taking almost always the form . Hence, you can inject your username and password this way: 

And you can read their time-stamps using a simple command. I think it will show creation time-stamps closed to deletion time. 

This is not possible. As stated by infixed you can still find you external drive device file using symlinks from or and associated mountpoint from there using if you want (not always installed). 

Is there a possibility that this problem could be caused by the GPU overheating or any other part of the mainboard? If so, why would an external monitor not be affected? Is a different chip responsible for the screen on the laptop or the external screen? Is the NVIDIA GeForce GTX850M that is part of the laptop taking care of both internal an external monitor? What part does the integrated Intel HD Graphics 4600 play? Any suggestions how to further troubleshoot this issue would be appreciated. 

I'm using the latest version of google chrome on a yoga book on windiws 10 and have the following problem: when I launch google chrome after a short while touch screen functions stop working correctly. It is as if the right mouse button was clicked as tapping on links only opens a context menu and scrolling does not work anymore. It has to be a software issue, most likely a chrom bug as only chrome is affected and all functions always work well for around one minute. 

I have recently replaced the battery of my Asus laptop, but ever since I'm running in some problem. I can always boot up normally and everything works fine. When I don't have it plugged in, quite often the screen suddenly turns black (connecting to an external monitor shows everything is ok), but the laptop monitor stays black until I put it quickly into standby and back on. When the computer is plugged in this happens as well, but only very rarely. Running on battery seems to make it much more susceptible to it. Any suggestions why a change in battery can cause something like that? 

I don't think you can do this. You need to copy/past again. The issue is not related to slash beeing also the substitute command separator, since substitute command accept any separator. The issue is about the back-slashes to be substituted, which have been already treated as simple useless escapements of character on their right. Hence, when you call the substitute command, backslash is already vanished from the source. Just try to re-call the command as is (). Instead of printing the exact same command including , it will execute the command minus already-processed backslashes which result in . And obviously you can not find nor replace a missing character. Trying to do so will fire an error. 

Yes you can. I finally successfully repaired my Win7 x64 computer few days ago and gave it a try this way: 

Also note that the command you run will search for every files as a first step, and then call only once with all matching names as a second step. Calling with 20 filename arguments is reasonable but 800 file-path argument becomes to be a bit too much. You system has limitations about the length of command-line argument (see ). I would suggest you directly ask to execute your command which will break calls in several sub-sets. Next command will call once per folder containing files, which appears reasonable: 

If you did not write it somewhere then you are unlikely to find it back. One of the very few way to get it is to consult ARP cache of computers connected on the same networks your laptop connected recently, and not restarted meanwhile. You must know that it is very hard to locate a computer given one of its MAC addresses since they are only visible on the same network the computer is currently connected to. You can not use it through the Internet. Another way could be to use online accounts your computer is configured to auto-join and track activity from there (online antivirus account if any, google connection logs if a google account is automatically used, maybe Microsoft Office 365 or Skype account, etc). You will then get public IP addresses the police can work with, or you can give those details to the police for it to ask any activity to the service provider if they don't give those data to end users. 

I chatted with Microsoft support and they eventually gave me a new product key. It was necessary to chat to a supervisor and explain to them that I had a faulty motherboard that was exchanged 

I'm operating on a large amount of data with python pandas and it is depended on RAM only. My computer only has 8GB of RAM but I have a 1TB SSD. Is there a way with windows 10 to increase my RAM with my hard disk? I read about virtual memory and a the paging file. This is already enabled but doesn't seem to have any effect on what the computer considers RAM. Any suggestions are appreciated. 

I purchased a new computer which has windows 8.1 pre installed. However, in order to keep my old data and software I took my old SSD hard drive over to my new computer. The hard disk has windows 10 installed, from a previous upgrade. Now Windows is asking me to activate and enter a product key. How can I get a product key? I have basically paid twice for windows, once on my old and once on my new computer. I can hardly be expected to purchase windows a third time. Who can I get a product key? thanks 

When I try to access the internet over a linux machine I get the following error that requires me to click on accept. How can I click it from a linux command line? 

My laptop with these specs recently started to have issues with the screen flickering or turning black entirely. Normally I would have said it's just the connector cable, but some of the behaviour make me think it could be something else: 

You can also add few more speed and safety options like relatime,nodev and maybe nosuid,noexec. See man mount for available options. 

The daemon can also helps in this situation. It runs in background and learn which programs and libraries are often in use. It then them on next boots for a faster launch. As opposite to those files are not locked in RAM but read once after boot so their RAM space can be reused for something else if required, hence there is no guarantee of a faster launch. 

And git v1.8.2 fixes that new behavior for command which was still affected. The workarounds I can see of interest are: 

I don't think you need to run as root for your need. Let's have a look to your hard disk device file. It should looks like this: 

Note that this behavior is not consistent across releases of column. Version 2.26 uses to compute cells visible width and leads to a different mis-alignment. 

This has to do with run levels, which selects a set of auto-started services. Recovery mode (which usually selects either run level or ) starts a very minimal set of services. It does not start graphical, network or antivirus ones to cite a few. You can see a list of services installed on your system this way: 

VLC supports both: general command-line options and per-MRL options. You can find details on VLC Wiki Command-line help: 

But the death and parentship of the child is not exactly as you say. Basically ­—and when the parent process is still alive— the child process is the child of its father (yes!-) It has its PPID (parent process ID) set to the still-alive process which forked it. Things changes when the parent process dies. Child process continues to live but its PPID is set to a still-alive gran-parent process. There is always one since process never dies.
