Everest generally works for me although its not free, you can have a go with the trial version though. 

I have a Dell Inspiron 1525, and my DVD drive suddenly stopped showing in Windows Explorer. When I checked device manager it shows this error "Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing." I tried to disable and re-enable it, also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the device. When it does re-install I get a prompt saying that "Windows has determined that this is the most current driver for your device." The device shows up in device manager with a yellow exclamation mark, is there any way I can download the drivers as there is no manufacturer name on the device and I can't find drivers for the DVD drive which is named "HL-DL-ST DVD+-RW GSA-T40N" in device manager. My current operating system is Windows 7 

I have my old data on backups now these are atleast 2-3 years old and we used to use DVD-R disks then, I burn using Nero and always verify my disks after burning. Now I have a new LG GH22NS50 Super Multi DVD Writer which doesn't read these disks, I checked these on my older Samsung optidrive dvd writer and they do detect but this DVD drive doesn't burn DVD's anymore and hence I'm stuck. Does this mean that all my old data won't read on new age DVD writers? I now burn to DVD+R disks but wat about my older data? besides this writer supports DVD-R so why won't it read. When I insert the disk it shows up a blank DVD and windows asks me if I want to burn data to it. Can anyone tell me why and how to solve this? 

Another recommendation is to use TimeSnapper, to keep track of your day and analyze it. There is a classic version which is free and a pro version which has more features but is paid. Here's a comparison chart between the two versions of the product. 

Have installed your firmware? Your laptop model comes with Vista drivers and those work perfectly with Windows 7. I have Windows 7 installed on the same model and it works perfectly with the Vista drivers that came with the laptop. If you don't have your drivers CD/DVD download them from this link 

Electronics are priced lower these days but so are their usable lives gettin shorter. Repairing the monitor would be a cheaper solution for right now, but u never know how many times your going to need to do that in the near future. You might even land up spending more in the long run. I'd suggest you buy a new monitor, will last you for a longer time than the repaired one anyways and will save you the time and the trouble of going back an forth to the repair shop. P.S. I have this pendrive that I have been using for the past 6 and a half years its 256mb in capacity an it cost me a fortune then but it works like a charm even today.. the 8gb drive that i have is the 4th one in the past 2 years so you know what i mean when i say that electronics are priced lower these day but their usuable lives.. emm.. you get the picture right? 

MyLifeOrganized seems to be the answer to my prayer. TimeEdition is nice but not that comprehensive in features as this one. Thanks 

You should be able to remove the keyboard layout by removing it, but as in your case it can't be done, the second (alternate) option seems more apt at the moment till someone else can figure that out. What I can show you is how to set DVORAK to be your default keyboard layout. Firstly you need to set DVORAK to be your default input language and apply the changes. This will set it to open all your programs with the DVORAK layout by default. 

Windows Update wants to keep installing an update that I have manually installed. How do I stop Windows update from alerting me to install this update. Is there anyway that i can delete this from the update manager? or tweak the update manager to understand that this software has been updated, without uninstalling and reinstalling the software. Also the update manager keeps wanting to install language packs that were already installed, this is very annoying as these are false updates anyway to bypass this?

If your objective is to record Skype calls, try this app its free to use to record your calls. I've used it for a few months it works well. 

How to Forge is a nice place to begin with, very visual, very friendly and detailed how to's. Click here for Ubuntu specific tutorials on How to forge I would highly recommend this tutorial: The Perfect Server - Ubuntu 10.04. Its the perfect tutorial to get your server up and running from scratch plus you learn from focused setup experience rather than just reading and experimenting experience (which is a good thing but its always better to get your hands dirty right at the beginning.) I found this site very helpful while working with CentOS

I think its possible if your running Windows Xp try this (I'm running windows 7 so no real way to check) Start-->Run->Mplayer2 source 

Not sure if this is your solution but LG has a network monitor solution. This allows for a single PC to be shared by up to 11 users at the same time. 

Got the solution I had for additional security disabled options on the lan adapter i.e. file and printer sharing and client for microsoft networks were unchecked. And hence some pc's which had these unchecked were non-discoverable on the local network 

The dump files are here if anyone wants them, anyone knows the solution to this? Extra Info: I have a Dell Inspiron 1525 with Windows 7 

You would need to open up your laptop to fix any loose connections are game for that? There could be a possibility that the card that connects the screen to the motherboard could be giving away. I suggest you get it checked up at a shop if you are not too sure about taking the laptop apart.

Along with CCleaner I use Defraggler once a week, also while i was using Windows Xp increasing the virtual memory and turning down the graphical effects showed a significant increase in speed. Also don't forget to include the temp folder to CCleaner as that is not included in the default options and its needs to be added from options -> include and then simply write the folder path 

This is what Microsoft has to say about Understand Application Compatibility just a generalized answer not directly targetted to skype but it covers most of the aspects of why compatibility mode was needed and its advantages and flaws. 

I have tried installing WAMP Server too and even that refused to start up. Edit: The computer is running Windows 7
