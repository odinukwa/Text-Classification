You have hit what I have always considered a pain point in the naming here. Let me start with a small correction to what you said: technically speaking, the MTU is the maximum size of an L3PDU inside an Ethernet frame. The L3PDU is made up of IP headers and payload. So payload =/= MTU. Now, when you talk about this informally, you often just say "payload", without clarifying whether you are talking about the payload of the Ethernet frame, or the effective payload of the L3PDU inside it. And this brings me to the issue: the confusion comes from the fact that some of the names actually overlap. When you talk about TCP MTU, you are effectively talking about the maximum packet size, which is a value that is independent from the physical Ethernet MTU, which remains 1500 bytes. In summary, the real MTU is the physical one, i.e. the maximum size of the IP packet inside an Ethernet frame. When you talk about MTU with regards to other network layers, you are effectively talking about the maximum packet size, which doesn't necessarily have the same value of the physical MTU. This article talks about this in a bit more detail, but here is an excerpt that is relevant to this question: 

Either the UE sends a PDP deactivation request before it is switched off or, if for example you pull the battery on the phone, it won't be able to and then you will instead hit the inactive timeout in the GGSN. 

I would argue that repeaters hardly do exist today. A repeater amplifies the electric signal but is a completely analogue device and does not in any way interpret the signal. A repeater is the same thing as a 2-port hub although I've seen some companies starting to use the term repeater for equipment that resembles a switch more than a hub. Contrast this with a switch that receives a frame, interprets it and extracts the destination MAC address which it then acts upon to forward the frame to it's correct destination. A bridge is the same thing as a 2-port switch. Due to the low cost of switches and their support for higher speeds, the market for hubs/repeaters is slim to none. 

Introduction The steps described in this manual have been applied in order to enable the connection between multiple VLANs which reside on the same switch. Two VLANs have been configured. VLAN 1: 

it appears that the is identical and the portchannel is in trunking mode. However, there was a discrepancy between the VTP passwords for some reason. After synchronizing the passwords on the VTP Client and Server by executing and changing a name of a VLAN ( && && ) on the VTP Server, the MD5 digests became identical 

After checking this thread on the Cisco Learning Network and subsequently executing some checks on both the VTP Client and Server, e.g: 

With two default routes you can achieve redundancy but other routers in your network will just follow the default route to the closest core router so load balancing might not be according to your needs. The easy solution is to just have full table everywhere but if some routers aren't up for it (limited TCAM or similar) you might need to opt for using a default route. Make sure that your core routers have a direct link between each other and exchange the full table over the iBGP session between them. If both core routers inject a default route but one loses its ISP link it needs to see the routes from the other core router so it still have valid paths to the Internet. With full tables like this you can also fine-tune the local-preference/MED/whatever of routes you receive from respective ISP to achieve more even load balancing. Do note how your other routers will still follow the default so traffic might go via one core router to the next core router and exit to your ISP. Full table avoids that. 

The role of modems is to modulate and demodulate (hence the word modem) data so that it can flow over the phone line, effectively transforming the data from digital to analog and viceversa. For this reason, they can be considered Layer 1 devices. They cannot work on Layer 3 of the OSI model (routers and Layer 3 switches can do that). Correct, but they are not necessarily used only with telephone cables. They could also be used with a cable (CATV) line. Yes, the data flows in the wires to the next network devices. In summary, the next router in the nextwork will receive the stream, deencapsulate it until the layer 3 IP packet inside it is exposed, and will use this information to decide where to send the data. This is repeated until the data arrives at the destination. 

The steps of this manual have been executed in order to configure SSH. Once SSH has been configured, how to access the switch from a computer using SSH? The following steps have been executed in order to assign an IP to a switch and subsequently connect to it. An IP has been assigned to a Cisco Layer3 switch. 

The following documentation has been read regarding EIGRP in order to configure it on Switch1 and 2. The Switches are connected via a port channel. However, neither Switch1 is able to find Neighbor2 located on Switch2 nor Switch2 is able to find Neighbor1 located on Switch1. Configuration: Switch1: 

And to answer the question in the title: yes, they are still used today. It's just that you don't see them most of they time because they are built-in the routers you buy in the shops. 

I think there is a little bit of confusion when it comes to some networking fundamentals here: first you say that "TCP works on top of IP", which is correct, and then you ask if it's possible for IP to send packets "without passing through TCP protocols". Since IP works at a lower OSI layer than TCP (IP is a level 3 protocol while TCP is a level 4 protocol), it's TCP data that gets encapsulated by IP, not viceversa. Every OSI layer (and TCP/IP layer for that matter), provides services to the layers above it and sends data to the layers below it. So yes, IP can send data without using TCP, it's TCP data that cannot avoid going through the IP layer. Note that potentially, another Level 3 protocol could be used, IP just so happens to be the most widely used one. 

LTE is a standard for building a mobile network. It lists the available bands on which to operate on and Band 4 is one of those bands. See $URL$ for a full list. If someone mentions only "LTE" than the band is not specified but you can look up which bands are in used by a specific operator in a given country on $URL$ For example, where I live (Sweden), that would be band 3, 7, 8 and 20 for my operator but no-one ever refers to it as "LTE with band 3,7,8 and 20", it's just called "4G" or "LTE". There could be a few different reasons for specifically mentioning the support of a band. If it is from a representative of the mobile operator it is likely they perceive it as a selling point. Lower frequencies have lower attenuation and therefore propagate further enabling better coverage. Higher frequencies are usually handed out in larger blocks so to enable higher throughput. Note how 20MHz of 900MHz spectra will enable the same speed as a 20MHz block in the 2600MHz band. Another reason, however a bit unlikely to be pitched by a operator representative, is that certain bands are less commonly supported on handsets, so you might want to check that the device you intend to use support the bands that the operator is using. 

Port 1, 2, 3 and 4 from Switch1 have been assigned to VLAN X. All systems bound to these port can access each other. 

System bound to port 1, 2, 3 and 4 from Switch1 are able to access each other, while these are unable to access the system bound to port 5 of Switch2 and vice versa. Question How to add ports from different switches to one VLAN and enable access from and to the systems bound to these ports? 

Introduction If VLANs are configured on one switch (Switch1) and this switch is subsequently connected to another switch (Switch2) using a port channel, the VLANs configured on Switch1 are visible as well if the console cable is plugged to Switch2. However, the ports assigned to VLANs by Switch1 are not visible, while viewing the configuration of Switch2. Question Is it possible to view the configuration of the ports of all switches in the network by plugging the console cable to one switch like this is the case for VLANs?
