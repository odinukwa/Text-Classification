I am seeing ASA VPN allowing user A to authenticate in both tunnel, how do i lock down so user A won’t be able to authenticate in Finance and user B won’t be authenticate to Sales, in short user can only authenticate to own group profile. 

Is this permanent so we can't remove it forever? or next software upgrade will wipe it out? How to deactivate if we don't want to use it? 

We activate Cisco licence (Security Plus) to enable 10G ports and everything working but now i want to that licence but i am getting this error 

You can run command on Cisco IOS using SNMP but its little complicated and not standard practice but anyway just following this document $URL$ I would prefered using shell script to rancid tool to execute command on cisco devices. 

What appropriate MTU size should be used in datacenter switches and routers? is there any standard or pros and cons? Default is 1500 but that isn't enough to push data. should we used 9000 MTU on all datacenter switches? 

We have created peer with our ISP and my ISP send community to do backhole but how do i configure that and send community string for blackhole traffic. ISP said use community for RTBH, I did following config but didn't work 

Cisco comes with 2.5G throughput license and later you can upgrade to 20G. I have question if i have 10G link and i get attack of 5G and i use ACL to drop all packet on ingress interface in that case does 2.5G comes in picture? How does 2.5G throughput affect my requirement to drop all packet in Ingress. 

We have Cisco ASA5500 and we purchased for users for 3 year now if i want to increase users count then how can i increase it to ? Can i just buy users license and add into or i have to by brand new users license? (what will happened to my old 25 users license in that case?) Interesting enough when i applied 25 users license, its not showing me anywhere that you have users even it is showing , does that means i have 5000 user limit? 

We have Cisco Nexus C9396PX and i want to run on this to do failover, I just looked at licence and its showing following does that mean switch has activated Layer 3 license? 

How do i check the status of failover to make failover is correctly configure. Is there any downtime or small packet loss? How do i do failover instead of active device? Anything else i need to make sure before doing failover? like sync config, connection etc? 

Questions: How does etherchannel will loadbalance traffic here when traffic coming from internet, L3 will hash IP src-dst but one that traffic pass to first L2 switch (distributed) how does that traffic will loadbalance on 2G link using ? what src mac address it would use and shared traffic? 

Is there an any option in cisco Router we can restrict size to something smaller? default is but for experiment i want to allow only and if packet if bigger than 512 discard them. 

HP 6120XG ( Interface 18 connected to Cisco switch port e1/18), I have put VLAN tagged on port 18 but my server can't ping, something is wrong or i didn't configure correctly.. 

Here is the connection table output, I can see UDP traffic and my SIP port 6050. How can i tell don't track UDP connection? 

We have following ASA 5585-x with two SSP-10 module and i am seeing following error when i plug my console on top (SSP-10) module. 

But i want to use and there you can't use wildcard so how do i adjust above mask in object-group with subnetmask? is following is correct in respect of masking?` 

We have implemented Remote access VPN on ASA and integrate with cloud base service, where we have LDAP server and provide RADIUS service to provide LDAP+OTP base authentication. In my VPN config we just tell use RADIUS for authentication and everything working fine but now if i want to create multiple Group and provide authentication base on group and set ACL, how can i do that? This is what we have, EMPLOYEE group and now i want to create other group which has only 2 users called CONTRACTOR and i want them not to authenticate using EMPLOYEE profile. 

I am seeing my interface is flapping but just wanted to make sure it whether it because of mixing fiber mode or something else. 

We have Cisco C3850 running license recently we decided to run protocol for that we need license. Question: Do i need to buy new license or i have already that i just need to activate using ? 

Solution: Talked to Cisco TAC support and they found rommon (Firmware Version) has bug, and they upgrade following two component 

Solution This is most interesting issue of my life so hold your breath...! Noticed CoPP Drops in glean & arp 

Question: We have two ntp server & and NTP server syncing time with public NTP server, should i put two different public NTP server list on NTP1 & NTP2 server or public NTP list supposed to be same on both ntp1 and ntp2 server, what is the best practice for that? UPDATE: Output: 

Remote vpn users can access network but they are not able to access network, i do have retune path etc in router. Interesting thing i can ping subnet from ASA but remote users can't access from ASA routing 

After shutdown port e1/24 problem resolved :) No CPU spike and no packet drop. I have open ticket to find out what device connected to e1/24 ( i believe its server but lets see) 

We have 4G (4x1G) LACP trunk between two cisco switch (c3850<--->c4948) and i am noticing it's not doing proper load-balancing. I found SW1 using algorithm and SW2 using algorithm. Should this suppose to be same? What is the best load-balancing method i should use? We have mix traffic in our environment like VoIP, TCP/UDP, SAN backup nightly etc. SW1: 

Q1. In above diagram i can see Core router connected to spine switches so that would be L3 network between them but is that going to be OSFP or HSRP style network and how multiple switch in spine will flow traffic up to Core layer? what protocol is advisable in this kind of scenario? Q2. between Leaf and spine it is going to be network so how Leaf switch will select link to send traffic to spine, how spanning tree or vPC will be created there for spine where spine are not interconnected? or am i missing something? 

But when i open data i am seeing wrong date like and port is , is it something related to cisco netflow setting? 

We have and i create (without intermediate switch/hub) two 1G cable between two ASA to create failover + stateful link using g0/6 and g0/7 interface. Interface config 

And i think who doesn't match will will use default route Is above config enough? or should i use too? Edit Do i need ? what if i don't do that? 

EDIT: Notes: We don't have router, all we have L2 switch network. We have many servers behind trunk, so should i use src-dsp-ip? or src-dst-mac ? 

Interface configuration: first i configured failover and then i run this command in this case it will set .109 ip on standby ASA-2 right? 

I am doing some practice on related switch and want to allow SSH from specific Ex: vlan1 In GNS3 i used router with 16NM ethernet module to emulate switch, so i am using following command to tell allow SSH from only vlan1, it seems not working. Do i need ? 

Actually we just want to do RTBH triggering and don't want to do high level of BGPing. It's going to be very simple implementation of BGP. 

I am configured about in community because my router not accepting that. here i am using route to send null. 

and this interface never come into forwarding state. what i am doing wrong here? is my cisco config is wrong on trunk? EDIT In f5 side we have default STP setting which is "Passthrough", Should i change it to RSTP? 

Now how do i allow my Internal Public IP subnet to access everything on internet. In stateful firewall you can do it because it hold state of connection but Router ACL isn't stateful. How do i solve this problem? 

I need suggestion related this issue. We are getting DDoS every two days and its small DDoS last for 5 to 10 min. but sometime its longer in that case we call ISP and they route specific targeted IP for sometime and we moved service to new IP. Now question is, is it possible we setup private BGP with our ISP and we do null route from our router so it trigger route on ISP route? In short we need control of doing null routing, calling every time ISP isn't good solution because sometime they are busy then we have to wait in line. Can anyone suggest what we should do? We are small company and can't effort buying outside service to scrub DDoS they are expensive. 

We have two primary & secondary and they are pretty old running from since last couple year and we never bother to touch but recently we are doing some maintenance and found we need to failover device without any downtime. Question: 

We have Cisco ASA VPN with Sonicwall but we are seeing randomly after 8 hours or sometime 10 hours. I am unable to trace issue so just wonder is there a simple setting to renegotiate tunnel automatically or something like that? We want to keep this tunnel IP for ever, what could be wrong? UPDATED config 

How do i router data between two VRF & ? EDIT If there any other way we can achieve this scenario without using VRF? 

We have many other tunnel and they all have also we have also wonder why above config doesn't have tunnel-group 

Just found today there is a 0-day exploit in many Cisco switch which use cluster management protocol which allow remote command execution. $URL$ As per above link when i run this command to check CMP is running or not, its seems its not enable on my switch does that means we are secure?
