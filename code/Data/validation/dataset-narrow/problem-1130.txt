Let $T_n,O_n,U_n$ denote the sets arising from these three cases, for a fixed size $n$. It is not too difficult to show the existence of a bijection $Sort_n : T_n \rightarrow O_n \times U_n$, which implies a well-known 'hook length' formula due to Knuth. One unpleasant aspect of this bijection lies in its assymetry: we would like to get a pair of similar objects in order to get extra symmetry properties (e.g. what would happen if we switch the two objects and then apply the reverse bijection?) Therefore, I'm asking naively if you think that the symmetry could be restored by considering more general structures. I'm not optimistic on this question though: there might be a positive but difficult answer that so far eludes me. A side remark: this bijection $Sort_n$ already enjoys some interesting symmetry properties in connection with the Schützenberger involution, but we would need something stronger to get an interesting algebraic object (possibly a Hopf algebra?) 

The well-known Gauss pivot method can be used to solve a system of linear equations over a field. I'm aware of two extensions of this method: (i) the Büchberger algorithm for computation of Gröbner bases, (ii) the resolution algorithms for CSPs with Maltsev polymorphisms (see 'Malt'sev Constraints made Simple' by V. Dalmau, 'Constraint satisfaction on finite groups with near subgroups' by T. Feder). I would like to hear about other variants/extensions of Gauss pivot to settings where we don't have an explicit field/group structure. For instance, can we solve efficiently a system of equations over a permutation group by a similar approach? This problem does not fall in case (ii) above as in general the solutions of an equation will not form a coset, although it should contain problem (ii) as a special case. 

Consider a set $S \subseteq \Sigma^n$ where $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet and $p : \Sigma \rightarrow [0,1]$ is a probability function. Let $T$ be a tree leaf-labeled by the elements of $S$. Consider the following random process which labels the nodes of $T$ in a bottom-up order. Given an unlabeled node $x$ whose children $y,z$ have been labeled with words $w_y,w_z$, we assign to $x$ a word $w_x$ as follows: 

I'm interested in two 'natural bijections' that involve labeled forests and Young tableaux. Let me give the definition for labeled forests. By this, we mean a pair $\cal{F} = (F,f)$ where $F$ is an $n$-vertex forest, and $f$ is a labeling of its nodes from $1$ to $n$. We say that: 

Consider two posets $P,Q$ and an element $x \in V(P)$. Let $Pe(x)$ denote the immediate predecessors of $x$ and let $Su(x)$ denote the immediate successors of $x$ in $P$. Let $Min_Q,Max_Q$ denote the minimal, resp. maximal, elements of $Q$. Fix two mappings $Conn_1 : Pe(x) \rightarrow Min_Q$ and $Conn_2 : Su(x) \rightarrow Max_Q$. It is then possible to define a poset $R$ by starting with $(P - x) \uplus Q$ and by adding an arc $(w,Conn_1(w))$ for each $w \in Pe(x)$, and an arc $(w,Conn_2(w))$ for each $w \in Su(x)$. This operation has a simple meaning for trees: given a tree $T$, you pick a node $u$, and you substitute it by a tree $T'$ by attaching the leaves of $T'$ to the children of $u$ in an injective manner. This means that the trees are closed under this operation of substitution, and thus we could expect that it preserves the property you're interested in. I admit though that I have no idea of what I'm doing with this defn, this might be a joke so please check on your side :) 

The following notion comes from algebraic combinatorics and might have some connections to language/permutation theory. Fix an integer $k$. Let us call a $k$-Yamanouchi word a sequence $u$ of integers in $[k]$ such that (i) for every prefix $v$ of $u$, we have $|v|_k \geq |v|_{k-1} \geq \ldots \geq |v|_1$, (ii) when $v = u$, the equalities hold. These words generalize the notion of Dyck words, which are basically 2-Yamanouchi words. It is well-known that Dyck words are counted by Catalan numbers and can be put in bijection with numerous objects (see e.g. here). On the other hand, $k$-Yamanouchi words are in bijection with Young tableaux of rectangular shape $k \times n$, and thus are counted by the "hook length formula": $Y^k_n = \frac{(kn)!}{n! (n+1)! \ldots (n+k)!}.$ I'm not aware of any other known bijections involving $k$-Yamanouchi words, so I am asking for possible references or new bijections, involving for instance trees or permutations. A note of caution: these objects seem much harder to handle algebraically than Dyck words so it's not clear whether they can give rise to "well-structured" objects such as trees. 

It is commonly admitted that strict constraints can be relaxed through a 'fuzzy' or 'statistical' framework, as suggested by the paper 'Fuzzy topology and order', Antarctica J. Math, 4(1) (2007), pp. 147-165. However, I believe that the 'half-integrality' suggested above should be sufficient for your concern, without resorting to a continuous spectrum of values. 

By the basis definition, it is immediate that a permutation $\pi$ is skew-merged iff both $\pi$ and $\pi^r$ are vexillary; this suggests some possible link between these two classes. I am interested in the following algorithmic questions: 

I'm currently investigating a family of temporal relations called 'Ordered Horn' ($OH$ for short). This class was introduced in 'Reasoning about Temporal Relations: A Maximal Tractable Subclass of Allen's Interval Algebra' by B. Nebel and H.J. Bürckert. Following this paper, we define an OH clause as a formula over $\mathbb{N}^k$ of the form: 

the skew-merged permutations consist of the permutations that can be partitioned in an increasing and a decreasing subsequence; their basis is $\{3412, 2143\}$. the vexillary permutations have basis $\{2143\}$; they have been introduced by Lascoux and Schützenberger in connection with Schubert calculus ('Schubert polynomials and the Littlewood–Richardson rule', Letters in Mathematical Physics 10(2), 111-124). 

Fix an integer $n$. Considered as a multiplicative group, the sets $A = (\mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z})^*$ and $B = \mathbb{Z} / \phi(n) \mathbb{Z}$ have the same cardinality $\phi(n)$, but it does not seem possible to give a 'well-behaved' bijection witnessing this fact. On the other hand, by considering the ring $R = \mathbb{Z} / n \mathbb{Z}$, it is possible to give a bijection between $R^A$ and $R^B$, considered as sets of functions. Indeed, any element $f \in R^A$ can be written uniquely as $f(x) = \sum_{y \in B} \hat{f}(y) x^y$ with $\hat{f} \in R^B$; this is well-defined as for $x \in R$ we have $x^{\phi(n)}$ congruent to $0$ or $1$ modulo $n$. Conversely, $\hat{f}$ can be recovered as $\hat{f}(y) = \phi(n)^{-1} \sum_{x \in A} f(x) x^{-y}$. This has the desired properties: consider the matrices $K \in R^{A \times B}$ and $L \in R^{B \times A}$ defined by $K(x,y) = x^y$ and $L(y,x) = x^{-y}$, it can then be checked that $K.L = L.K = \phi(n) I$. I would like to know if there are references to this bijection in the literature, and if there are other examples of 'indirect bijections' witnessing a combinatorial identity for which a direct bijective proof is not known. 

I don't have a definite answer to your question, but "braid sorting" seems a possible candidate. According to this wikipedia entry we can define it as follows. Let $X$ be a group, and let $H$ denote the set of tuples $(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \in X^n$ such that $x_1 \ldots x_n = 1_X$. If we let $G$ be the braid group $B_n$ generated by the moves $\sigma_i$, we can define an action of $B_n$ over $H$ by: 

Schnyder Theorem states that a graph is planar iff its incidence poset has dimension at most 3. This has been extended by Mendez to arbitrary simplicial complexes (see "Geometric Realization of Simplicial Complexes", Graph Drawing 1999: 323-332). Strangely enough there is a much older paper with a very similar title "The geometric realization of a semi-simplicial complex", but I suspect that it's on a different topic. 

Metamathematics started in the 19th century with the discovery of paradoxes intrinsic to certain axiom systems involving infinite objects; attempts to resolve these paradoxes led to the formulation of set theory, transfinite arithmetics, and more recently to model theory/proof theory. While of interest to mathematicians, this line of research had so far a small impact on combinatoricians / computer scientists which deal with finite or countable structures. In particular the countable structures we are interested in are often $\omega$-categorical which rules out the possibility of independence results à la Gödel. So I would like to know if there are examples of interactions of metamathematics with "concrete" combinatorics (by which I mean essentially discrete algebra, structured algorithms and computational complexity), and how these kinds of interaction could possibly materialize given the apparent absence of overlap of the fields. 

Consider a variety of algebras $\mathbb{V} = \mathbb{V}(\sigma,\tau)$ which consists of the set of algebras defined over a fixed signature $\sigma$ and satisfying a set of identities $\tau$. We may then define its ordered version $\mathbb{V}_{or}(\sigma,\tau)$ cas the set of algebras admitting a total order $\leq$ compatible with $\sigma$. By this I mean that: (*) for each $f : X^n \rightarrow X$ in $\sigma$, for each tuples $t,t' \in X^n$, if $t_i \leq t'_i$ for every $i \in [n]$ then $f(t) \leq f(t')$. Given such an ordered algebra $A$, we may define its order type $ot(A)$ as the maximum order type of a well-founded order $\leq' \subseteq \leq$ without accumulation points. We may then define the spectrum of the variety $\mathbb{V}$ as the set of ordinals obtainable in that way. Is this notion known in universal algebra, and if so, which varieties have a known spectra? An easy case seems to be the variety of ordered fields: for instance, the field of reals $\mathbb{R}$ would have order type $\omega$, and the field of rational fractions $\mathbb{R}(x)$ would have order type $\omega^{\omega}$. So is the following true: Conjecture: the spectrum of the ordered fields consists of the ordinals closed under addition and multiplication? (NOTE: I added the requirement that $\leq'$ has no accumulation points, as otherwise any countable ordinal would be embeddable in $\mathbb{R}$. The precise meaning is relative to $\leq$: if $S$ is the set of elements of $\leq'$, we ask that for every $x \in S$, there is an interval $I$ of $\leq$ properly containing $x$ s.t. $I \cap S = \{x\}$.) 

It is well-known that sorting permutations by transposition is in $\sf{P}$, as the minimum number of transpositions required to sort $\pi \in S_n$ is exactly $inv(\pi) = \{ (i,j) \in [n] \times [n] : i < j \text{ and } \pi(i) > \pi(j) \}$. This notion of "inversion number" has also applications in algebraic combinatorics, for instance it allows to endow $S_n$ with a structure of lattice, called the permutohedron and based on the weak Bruhat order. It can be illuminating to recast the problem in group-theoretic terms. We are given a group $G$ with generator set $\Gamma$ and a mapping $i_G : \Gamma^* \rightarrow G$, and another group $H$ on which $G$ acts transitively, and we want to solve the following problem: given $h \in H$, find a minimum-length $w \in \Gamma^*$ such that $i_G(w).h = 1_H$. In the permutation case, $G = H = S_n$ and $\Gamma$ is the set of transpositions. Question: are there other instances of this problem which admit efficient algorithms? 

The notion of Tits building was introduced by Jacques Tits to study certain questions in group theory. The wikipedia entry gives a way to construct a Tits building from a vector space, but I would be interested in a simpler construction defined as follows. Let $\mathbb{V}$ be a vector space over a field $\mathbb{F}$. Construct a simplicial complex $SCI(\mathbb{V})$ with ground set $\mathbb{V}$, where the simplices are the linearly independent subsets of $\mathbb{V}$ - note that this essentially defines a representable matroid. Consider two basis $B^1 = \{u^1_1,\ldots,u^1_n\}$ and $B^2 = \{u^2_1,\ldots,u^2_n\}$ of $\mathbb{V}$, such that the basis-change matrix $M_{B^1,B^2}$ is lower-triangular. We can then define an apartment $O_{B^1,B^2}$ which is the subcomplex of $SCI(\mathbb{V})$ formed by the subsets $\{u^{i_1}_1,\ldots,u^{i_p}_p\}$ for $1 \leq p \leq n, i_j \in \{1,2\}$. Question: does this construction satisfy the four axioms of a Tits building (given in the above link)? If so, what are the possible applications to matroid theory? 

It is frequent to find statistical studies observing some correlation between two events; this correlation is often interpreted by the medias as a causality relation (e.g. "blue-eyed people have more kids" or "obese people have more chronic diseases") although most often there is little scientific support in favor of one causality relation rather than the other. So the reasonable conclusion is that these studies can only observe "correlation" but not "causality". Now suppose that a correlation between two events $A$ and $B$ could be interpreted not as a binary causality (e.g. $A$ implies $B$) but as a ternary relation involving an unobservable "cause factor" trigerring an observable "correlation" (e.g. $K$ implies $A$ and $B$). This leads to some basic questions that might have some connection with computer science / graph theory. First, even if we cannot detect the "cause factor", can we distinguish experimentally between the above two scenarii? Second, is it still possible to prove "causality" with a more fine-grained knowledge of reality, or do we have to abandon it completely? I guess this second question hinges on physics and philosophy, as it depends on the assumed model of physical reality -- for instance causality makes sense in a deterministic, sequential world but maybe not in some alternate models involving quantum theory and branes ??- (NOTE ADDED: I expect that my answer will be labeled as "off-topic" but there might still be some cross-disciplinary people interested in it) 

The structure you suggest is known as a 'semihypergroup', a notion introduced by F. Marty in 1934. According to Google, some of your questions have already been attacked by a diverse community of mathematicians involving Greeks, Iranians and Thai people. The most challenging question seems point (iv) but I'm unsure about the outcome, though a positive result in that directions would probably have far-reaching consequences -- possibly in relation with Rhodes' interest in the separation of complexity classes. 

I am interested in two "super-objects" problems from computational biology. The first problem, dubbed Shortest Common Supersequence ($SCSy$), takes a family of sequences $s_1,\ldots,s_k$, and seeks a common supersequence of minimum length. The second problem, dubbed Shortest Common Supertree ($SCSx$, introduced here), takes a family of p-trees $t_1,\ldots,t_k$, and seeks a common supertree of minimum length. I have some issues ascertaining the fixed-parameter tractability or $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hardness of the following parameterizations: (i) $SCSy$ parameterized by the number of sequences $k$: the problem is claimed to be $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard in M. Hallett's thesis without proof; (ii) $SCSx$ and $SCSy$ parameterized by the number of duplications of the super-object: in the above mentioned paper, the first problem is claimed to be FPT and the second is claimed to be $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard, but I couldn't convince myself whether this is correct. Any people from the FPT scene willing to help? 

A (possibly infinite) group $G$ is noetherian if it satisfies the following equivalent conditions: (1) every subgroup of $G$ is finitely generated, (2) there is no infinite strict ascending chain of subgroups, (3) any non-empty collection of subgroups has a maximal element under inclusion. Note that this property is hereditary: if $G$ is noetherian then so are all its subgroups. Also, being noetherian is equivalent to require that the poset of subgroups $(Sub(G),\subseteq)$ is a well-order. The order type of a well-order $(S,\leq)$ is defined as the supremum of the order type of its linear extensions. By extension, we may define the order type of a noetherian group $G$, denoted by $ot(G)$, as the order type of $(Sub(G),\subseteq)$. We may then ask the following questions: (1) What ordinals $\alpha$ can be obtained as the order type of a noetherian group? (2) Is it possible to reduce that question to noetherian simple groups? For instance, if $H$ is a normal subgroup of $G$, is it true that $ot(G) = ot(H) + ot(G/H)$? 

Due to the apparent unpopularity of my previous posts, I'd like to post a question about graph theory which seems to be a popular topic here :) Among the many known classes of perfect graphs, there are three classes that I find especially interesting: (1) the weakly chordal graphs, whose obstruction set is $\{C_n,\bar{C_n} : n \geq 5\}$, (2) the chordal graphs, whose obstruction set is $\{C_n : n \geq 4\}$, (3) the strongly chordal graphs, whose obstruction set is $\{C_n : n \geq 4\} \cup \{S_n : n \geq 3\}$. Here, $C_n$ denotes the $n$-cycle, and $S_n$ denotes the $n$-sun (obtained by starting from a cycle $x_1 ... x_n$ and adding the edges $x_i y_i x_{i+1}$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$). These classes admit polynomial algorithms for clique/independent set, the most general one being for the class of weakly chordal graphs and uses a clever 'two-pair contraction' argument (see 'Optimizing weakly triangulated graphs' by R. Hayward, C.T. Hoang and F. Maffray). Intersection models are known for classes (2) and (3) as they correspond to the clique graphs of acyclic, resp. totally balanced, hypergraphs. Are there any known results about intersection models for weakly chordal graphs? As a side note, there is a recursive construction of totally balanced hypergraphs due to Lehel (see 'A characterization of totally balanced matrices'), and I was also wondering about possible algorithmic applications of this result?
