I imagine that since actual server name and apparent email domain are different, sending mail is somehow considered open relay and actual message goes to void. Anyway, does anyone have an idea, how to fix discrepancies with name or how to fix SMTP server name? TNX! 

For details, read the Whitepaper: Configuring Outlook Profiles by Using a PRF File -> link I created a very simple logon script, almost too simple, actually. I could have checked whether the profile already exists and skip the procedure altogether, but sometimes quick and dirty works just as fine: 

Consider also the path for Offline mail caching... You might want to rename the file if you're using two profiles, so that one profile does not overwrite the cached emails of the second profile and vice versa: 

Further comments: The larger company is planning to implement seconnd solution internally for accountants and other "office" PCs. The infrastructure isn't there yet, but people with experience in this area will work on it. The smaller company would then also have about a third of its computers virtualized and put up on terminal server. 

we used to have Exchange on the SBS 2003 server inside our AD environment. Earlier this year we moved to outside Exchange provider but for the time being our local Exchange was still up&running and forwarding email to the new email accounts. Now the time has come to turn it off and I'm not quite sure what that means for SBS environment and how to proceed. Specifically, there is a local e-mail account associated with every user in the domain. Can I simply change the e-mail address of every user to their outside address, or should I first delete the Exchange account for every user + their Mailbox, and only then update the e-mail address? What do you suggest? How do I proceed? TNX! 

I think I need to set up Queue Trees on the Mikrotik and create a main queue for the available up/down speeds and divide by some priorities. Currently I don't know where to start as I can't see a way to create two distinct queues for incoming and for outgoing traffic (as I have an asymmetrical bandwidth). I see there are predefined (parent) queues for each interface but the problem is that I am using VLAN to provide WAN access to three completely independent subnets. The single physical port I'm using is : 

One of the decisions left to take is whether to use software RAID1 or hardware RAID1 + BBU. Software RAID is the solution I'm very familiar with (I'm managing a number of servers since 15 years and I know how the tools work). I never had a serious problem with it (mainly only the HDD fail). These are the reasons why I prefer software RAID. What I dislike about hardware RAID is the incompatibility between controller vendors and the lack of experience I'm having with them: different configuration options, different monitoring method, different utility programs - not a good feeling for creating a cluster system. I know that, when using a BBU, hardware RAID can both be fast and reliable (write through cache). However, since all data will be stored in a highly redundant manner in the cluster, my idea is to use software RAID1 and disable barriers in the file system to increase write performance. I expect that this will lead to similar performance like hardware RAID1. Of course, I risk data loss due to the volatile write cache, however IMHO that should be handled by the clustering mechanisms anyway (the whole machine should be able to restore data from the other nodes after failure). I'm not having concerns about the CPU resources needed by a software RAID implementation. Is my assumption correct or am I missing some important detail that would help me making the right choice? 

SITUATION: A larger company acquires a smaller one. IT infrastructure has to be merged. There are no immediate plans to change the current size or role of the smaller company - the offices and production remain. It has a Win 2003 SBS domain server, Win 2000 file server, linux server for SVN and internal Wikipedia, 2 or 3 production machines, LTO backup solution. The servers are approx. 5 years old. Cisco network equippment (switches, wireless, ASA). Mail solution is a hosted Exchange. There are approx. 35 desktops and laptops in the company. IT infrastructure unification: There are 2 IT merging proposals. 1.) Replacing old servers, installing Win Server 2008 domain controller, and setting up either subdomain or domain trust to a larger company. File server and other servers remain local and synchronization should be set up to a centralized location in larger company. Similary with the backup - it remains local and if needed it should be replicated to a centralized location. Licensing is managed by smaller company. 2.) All servers are moved to a centralized location in larger company. As many desktop machines as possible are replaced by thin clients. The actual machines are virtualized and hosted by Terminal server at the same central location. Citrix solutions will be used. Only router and site-2-site VPN connection remain at the smaller company. Backup internet line to insure near 100% availability is needed. Licensing is mainly managed by larger company. Only specialized software for PCs that will not be virtualized is managed by smaller company. I'd like to ask you to discuss both solutions a bit. In your opinion, which is better from the operational point of view? Which is more reliable, cheaper in the long run? Easier to manage from the system administrator's point of view? Easier on the budget and easier to maintain from IT department's point of view? Does anybody have any experience with the second option and how does it perform in production environment? Pros and cons of both? Your input will be of great significance to me. Thank you very much! 

This only works as long as both machines have running. I can start/stop and consistenly only see replies while the program is running on both machines at the same time. It doesn't matter on which machine I try. Is this a kernel bug or (more probable) has my configuration some problem? Is it normal, that the bridge and bonding interface both show the same MAC address? I only configure it manually for the bonding interface, which apparently changes also the bridge.. FYI, config overview: 

IPsec To get a secure connection, all IP traffic is encrypted using IPsec. This works, I can ping between the two machines without any problem and shows only encrypted packets. GRE-TAP A GRE-TAP (tunnels Ethernet frames over IP) interface is then set up in both directions, because I will need a virtual network interface later on: 

Update I get a working setup when I set the bridge interface into promiscous mode (). I'm not quite sure if that is normally needed. OTOH I don't think it has any downsides... BTW, there a similar RedHat bug report exists, but setting down/up doesn't help in my case.. 

I have Linux devices with a single ethernet interface and two IP adresses. The first () is statically configured to . The second () is configured via DHCP and it may happen that it gets a similar IP like , meaning that the subnets overlap. The routing table looks like this: 

I have a standalone Win 2003 server with Windows Sharepoint Services (WSS3) running on it. I had to rename the server and I had bunch of problems resulting from this. Note that the server is not in AD environment. I fixed the problems with Sharepoint (directly related to a rename) by using steps 1 & 3 from this site (TNX) Nevertheless, there are still strange references to old server name all over the place: in registry, in Windows Internal database, in Sharepoint Central Administration... Most disturbing problem is that Sharepoint isn't able to send email notifications to participants. This is IMO due to the fact, that Simple Mail Transfer Protocol service is still "answering" with old server name. When I try to telnet locally to the mail server (SMTP), I get a response: 

If it is possible you could try moving WinSXS to another partition as a workaround. To my knowledge there isn't any way to get rid of the contents of WinSXS. This cute little thingy is in the heart of Vista/Win2008 operation, so... I haven't heard anything better as moving it to another partition. Here's a link to a blog describing how to do it: Click I would suggest you do a full backup (even better: an image) of your entire C: partition before trying the procedure. Mind you that I tried this only on Vista, not on Win2008 Server. 

NB: is a separate active NIC (Ethernet cross cable) but that should not matter IMHO. The problem The setup looks good to me, however, PING does not work (this was run on ): 

I'm trying to get Linux bonding working over a VPN (GRE-TAP). The funny thing is, that it only works when I have running on both hosts, but more on that later... There are two machines, called and . They are connected together using a simple switch via eth1. 

The bridge works because when I activate the interface and set up some IP addresses (just for testing the bridge), ICMP PINGs work perfectly. 

This is on . On the other host the same interface is set up in the other direction. Bridge A bridge is set up that currently uses only the GRE-TAP device. I need the bridge because later on I want to add more machines (my plan is to bridge all GRE tunnels together). The end result should become a VPN mesh network (with a dedicated GRE-TAP interface for each host-host combination). But since for now I'm just doing a first test with two machines, the bridge is of course somewhat useless, but nonetheless important for the test itself. 

I guess creating a queue for parent won't work as packets won't be marked on that level (right?), since all packets are VLAN-tagged. I'd like to have the same QoS as I had with FireQOS but what's really important is the VoIP part. So, how should I configure the Queue Tree? 

I have a user in a domain who has access to multiple subfolders in multiple folders. His rights were defined pretty granularly. Now he's leaving the company but will continue to work for a firm as a contracted resource. I need to find all folders he had access to and revoke his permissions, then set him up with a different set of access permissions. Is there any tool (freeware, preferably) that lists all NTFS permissions for a given user? I've tried with AccessEnum from Sysinternals, but the list cannot be filtered by username and is useless for me. I've looked at CACLS, too, but as far as I can tell it displays permissions ordered by file, not by user. Any ideas? 

Next, I attached script to OU Group policy and voila! I wrote Instructions for users, and still helping some to finish setting up the profile. Still much easier as manually configuring all clients. Anyway, the following site was crucial for my breakthru, so it deserves to be linked here: Pay them a visit Thanks to Matthew, his post pointed me in right direction. 

Well, I found the solution that works perfectly. It uses a simple Logon script, so Avery Payne, one might say you were at least partially right :) Outlook (2003 and later, don't know about earlier versions) allows importing the profile info through PRF file. It is a plain text file, so you can write it from scratch, or preferably - export it from existing profile and edit as needed. I used the second variant. I downloaded Office Resource Kit - I was exporting PRF file from 2003 version, so I downloaded Outlook 2003 version (ORK.EXE, download it here). Installed it and got the Custom Installation Wizard, which enables you to export existing profile to PRF file. Needless to say, you first need to configure a working profile on the PC you're exporting from. After successful export, I edited the PRF file to lose unnecessary stuff and to generalize some settings with Windows variables, so that I get user specific info after the PRF file is imported:
