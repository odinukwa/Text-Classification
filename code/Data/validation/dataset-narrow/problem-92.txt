Great question! This is because a layer-2 switching loop can form on the Consumer-grade switching equipment which could produce Broadcast Radiation and impact devices connected to the broadcast domain. 

While DNS and DHCP services are often available on a router, they are often taxing on the networking device, limited in features, limited in management capabilities and are not suitable in medium to large scale deployments. @RonMaupin addresses the first point very well, but I also want to draw attention to the other two points. 

The thresholds will differ depending on the IOS, platform, and component in question. The command will display the temperature thresholds. When a threshold is crossed, a SNMP trap will be sent, if the router is configured to do so. Here is a sample output: 

More information on the command can be found in the Cisco IOS Configuration Fundamentals Command Reference . 

STP was originally standardized as IEEE 802.1D. Its purpose is to build loop-free, layer 2 typologies. STP does not detect and then mitigate Broadcast Radiation. STP builds loop-free topologies by sending special frames called Bridge Protocol Data Units. 

According to your screenshot, the ARP Cache entry for 192.168.1.1 is , which is likely the MAC address of the router interface to which you are connected. According to your output of , the MAC Address of your Network Interface is . 

I was able to fully replicate your topology in GNS3 using IOS 12.4 without any issues or error messages, and without any changes to the configurations you provided. R2 may have had the incorrect configuration at one point which resulted in error messages on R1. Another possibility is that R1, R3 and R4 were connected to a single SW1 at one time. The error can also be replicated using your topology by connecting SW1 and SW2 via a single cable. If you are actively receiving the error messages, I suggest double-checking your EIGRP configurations. You can use the following commands to verify the EIGRP configuration and neighborship. 

will drop all unknown destinations. Without a more complete configuration it is difficult to hypothesize its full purpose. A popular ISP service is to provide a private Layer 3 MPLS cloud without Internet access. In this scenario, the customer branch location would send their default traffic (Internet traffic) to the customer HQ, rather than directly to their ISP. would be in the customer VRF and could be a safeguard on the provider side to drop all other traffic. 

I recommend reading O'Reilly's Network 101, Primer on Latency and Bandwidth for a reference on this topic. O'Reilly defines Latency and Bandwidth as follows: 

To put it another way- Imagine that you have an entire library of books to transfer to another library. Your data set is the books that need to be moved. You can transport the books on trucks. The trucks represent a packet. The road represents the network. The speed limit and traffic lights represent the latency on a particular road or transit medium. The number of lanes on each road or maximum number of trucks that can drive simultaneously represent the bandwidth. Increasing the speed limit or independently using a 10-lane highway to transport the books may get the books to the new library faster. However, changing the speed limit did not widen the roads, nor did widening the road change the speed limit. Which gets ten trunks full of books to the new library faster? One truck that can be sent to arrive every 10 minutes or 10 trucks that take 100 minutes to arrive? Both will get ten trucks of books to the new library after 100 minutes. Which is better? That depends on the type of traffic and situation. The literature goes into the concept deeper with some detailed examples. 

On ASAs, some ACL rules will implicitly allow returning traffic. These rules only need to define a single direction of traffic. The CLI Book 2: Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide, 9.7 call out distinctions. 

Thus, if you wish to revert, you must overwrite the current permanent key with another permanent key with fewer features. If you do not have such a key on-hand, you will need to contact the Cisco License Team. A user in another forum reported that they were able to accomplish this successfully. 

It sounds like you are using a single Tunnel interface to define both DMVPNs at the Spoke-End. Split your DMVPN at the Spoke-End into two tunnels and you can influence EIGRP path selection with tunnel Bandwidth or Delay. 

For the IOS Guides, you have to drill into the individual error messages to find the severity level. The ASA has a specific section, breaking down the severity Level. Per Cisco documentation, the ASA IOS does not actually list any Severity 0 (Emergency) level messages. After a quick glance, I was not able to come up with any IOS Syslog messages with a Severity 0 (although, some may be found after some deep digging into the documentation). Cisco does not call out any reason for lack of Severity 0 messages. However, Cisco does allows users to reassign the severity of Syslog messages. I suspect the lack of default Severity 0 messages is to give users a custom level to which they can assign. The thought process could be that if a user needs to reassign a Syslog Message Severity Level, it must be very important and it will likely be assigned the highest severity level. 

This depends on the type of traffic (Stateful/Non-Stateful), type of failover (Active/Active, Active/Standby, Cluster), type of failure (monitored interface down, hardware failure, flapping interface, etc), failover timers, and how modern the hardware is. I always recommend a maintenance window and prepare for unexpected downtime. Thorough testing will provide a baseline. Cisco has some guidelines here: $URL$ 

$URL$ If your example ACL was on an ASA, you would still be required to explicitly define the reverse traffic because the protocol, , is stateless. Router Extended ACLs do not have notion of statefulness. The reverse/returning traffic must be explicitly defined. An exception to this rule is "Reflexive ACLs" and are outside the scope of this post. $URL$ 

No, it is not possible to change the MTU for a single interface, nor is it possible to change the MTU without a reload on your switch platform. The documentation you provided explicitly confirms this statement and describes why. Environmental variables such as MTU or configuration registers are global variables. This means it affects the entire switch. The switch loads its environmental variables during the switch boot process, prior to the loading of the switch configuration. 

By default, if the interface is down, administratively shutdown or non-connected the route will not be injected into the routing table. This is a caveat when using interfaces as the next hop instead of an IP address. There are exceptions to this such as Null interfaces. 

There are other purposes and uses for this configuration, but it is safe to say Internet Access is the most common goal.
