The easiest solution: Tell your carrier that they have to choose different VLANs for this traffic engineering purpose. You are the customer!! Their sales-engineers should have gathered the appropriate information to make sure there wasn't overlap before designing this solution/service for you. Don't accept the circuits until they resolve their issue. IF they are using Q-in-Q, they only need to know which VLAN goes to which location for administrative purposes, not for any technical reason, and should be able to change their configuration. More complicated solution: Investigate Q-in-Q tagging/VLAN tunneling, for yourself. Depending on your hardware/licensed capabilities, you could maintain your locally significant VLAN tags, and then slap another tag on the frame for the carrier. Then when the frame arrives at your destination, strip the extra tag off, then send the frame on it's way based on the original VLAN. 

DHCP Discovery (DHCPDISCOVER) - Sent by the Client seeking a DHCP Server. DHCP Offer (DHCPOFFER) - Sent by the DHCP Server to offer an address (and other DHCP options) to the Client. DHCP Request (DHCPREQUEST) - Sent by the Client to accept the lease for the offered address. DHCP Acknowledgement (DHCPACK) - Sent by the Server to acknowledge that the Client now has the lease for that address. 

As I said above, I can force the traffic over to my preferred path (R3 to ASA1) by manually setting the cost on R4's link to ASA1 higher: 

(If you want more info, the Cisco IOS Security Configuration Guide, specifically the sections on Configuring IPSec Network Security and Configuring Internet Key Exchange Security Protocol, go into more detail on the relevant commands.) 

This is why you would see them utilized for devices on the local network. The reasoning behind at least parts of each of these three "private" address ranges is fairly straightforward, but again outside of logic, these are guesses based upon my readings over the years. First consider that the classful networks are as follows (source Wikipedia article on Classful Network): 

There are many other ways you could go about it, that's just one possibility. This doesn't give you supervisory ability to only connect the call if a customer answers, but that's part of what the UCCX and UCCE solutions provide. 

Note: Unless we can get one of the original authors of RFC 1918/RFC 1597 or someone from InterNIC/RIPE NCC at that time (1994-1996) to comment*, we may be left at taking guesses, and the answers to this question being mostly opinion based. 

Go to Monitoring, then select VPN from the list of Interfaces Then expand VPN statistics and click on Sessions. Choose the type of tunnel you're looking for from the drop-down at the right (IPSEC Site-To-Site for example.) Click on the tunnel you wish to reset and then click Logout in order to reset the tunnel. 

(It's also worth noting as well, that if Comcast gave you those public IPs that you're using in the static NAT statements, they won't work out your Verizon connection.) 

R1 has no clue that it is part of an LSP that spans to R6. It only cares about the local/connected labels and FECs. That is part of what makes MPLS Label Switching fast and effective. It doesn't have to know the whole path. The router just knows that to reach , I apply label , and exit interface . Then later hops in the path utilize the same process, swapping in the appropriate next hop label and switching the packet on. 

The configuration from your customer is a Cisco IOS crypto configuration from a Cisco router, it is not interchangeable with Cisco ASA software. You will need to take the relevant portions of that configuration (PSK, peer IP, crypto ACL) and put them into a Cisco ASA configuration like your existing tunnels. It would presumably be similar to the below: 

Once you have the MAC address of your client, you can run the command where is the MAC address of the client you're interested in. It should give you all the information you're after. You can also run and see this information for all associated clients. See the below sample: 

This gives a readout for which OID's you are polling. It will allow you to see, by judging the time stamps, which OID is taking a long time to poll. This is usually where your problem lies. See the below sample output: 

Yes, LSP's exist towards all reachable FECs. And an MPLS packet could now be switched across the network. 

I have verified that our older locations using 2821's do not have this issue... is this something to do with IOS 15, the ISR Gen2's or both? 

CME 8.6 will only work with CUE versions 7.3, 7.4, 8.5, and 8.6. Since you're talking about a plain NM-CUE in a 2811, that module will only support up to CUE version 7.0. Your best bet for a hardware solution would be the NME-CUE, which can support up 8.6 in my testing. The other option, depending on your other requirements for 15.(1)M4, would be to roll back to an older IOS on the 2811 for an older CME. See the Cisco Unity Express Compatibility Matrix and the Cisco Unfied CME and Cisco IOS Software Compatability Matrix for more information. 

However, without LTM configuration of some sort (Virtual Server, Forwarding Virtual Server, SNAT, or NAT), the traffic would simply be dropped and never even reach the point of doing a route-lookup against the routing table. The F5 LTM is a Default Deny device, it will not forward traffic that you have not explicitly permitted/configured. Finally, for more information on Forwarding Virtual Servers, read SOL7595 and for more information on Static Routing on the LTM, read SOL13833. 

And there are more conditions, but the bottom line is that wireless networks are wireless, so there's no guarantee of delivery of traffic and therefore no guarantee of receipt on your Monitoring station. :) 

There are several ways to find the IP ranges of major organizations such as Facebook. The most basic of these, is to open up your terminal/command line of choice and issue the command: . This gives you the associated IP address to that DNS name; in this case, was the answer from my DNS server. Then run a "whois" lookup for that IP address (you can go to Whois.net if you don't have a whois tool in your command line): The relevant output in this case is: 

To directly address your questions, it will usually require very specialized configurations to accomplish the spanning of Airplay services across your network. And the specific configuraition will depend heavily on your current wireless solution (Cisco, Aerohive, Ubiquity, etc). In general, if you search for your wireless vendor and Bonjour, you should find documentation to at least point you in the right direction. I have had mixed success deploying Cisco's Avahi Bonjour gateway solution, and wouldn't recommend looking into it unless you absolutely have to. The bottom line to me is, as you pointed out in your third question, you'll always be at Apple's mercy because this is a closed, proprietary, undocumented service* intended for home network environments. So, unless Apple decides to change that, I would avoid implementing it in an Enterprise network wherever possible. *The underlying code for mDNSResponder is open, non-proprietary, and available under the Apache license. However, Apple's implementations of this internal to their iDevices and MacOS are all outside your control and could change at anytime. 

Be in range of the sending station (duh) Be of the same type as the sending station (single vs multiple spacial streams for example) Be listening to the same channel/frequency as the sending station (listening to 2.4 GHz channels won't help you capture 5Ghz traffic, etc) 

Honestly, the most common way that I've seen the 3750's hit the curb, was when the core switches were upgraded to Nexus 7k's. Usually (but not always) part of that refresh is to move TOR to Nexus 2000 FEXs or Nexus 5000s. Even though the 3750's don't have the largest buffers, in most people's minds, they work "well enough" in most enterprise DC environments. Unless you can put a dollar value on the problems caused by having 3560's/3750's in a DC, I doubt you'd be able to convince management to replace them outside of a regular product refresh cycle.

First, I look at the running-configuration for the object name and for the string , which matches . This gives us the names of all network object-groups, and we now have to simply look for instances of , then go up to find what object-group it is a member of: 

Class-maps can be used for much more than just policing traffic. The more general "cbQOSClassMapStats" would show a different count if you were also taking other actions than just "police". For example, if in the same class map you were also queueing, you'd need to look at the "cbQOSQueueingStats" OID. I'd recommend reading through Cisco's MIB object navigator for CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-MIB for more information. 

Remember what the F5 LTM is for, it is a Load Balancer and is designed to explicitly proxy connections through it's Virtual Server constructs. In order to have it simply pass traffic, you can configure a "Default" Forwarding Virtual Server that listens on all addresses and on all ports. This allows you to somewhat cheat the system, and have it transfer traffic through the device, but not to a pool of servers. This is commonly used to allow traffic to flow from the servers behind the LTM, outbound to the world for patching, etc. In addition, if you wanted to do more than simply route that traffic (for example to apply any of the dozens of wonderful "knobs" that the LTM provides such as TCP fixup or an iRule), you could do that on a Forwarding Virtual Server. 

Now as a note, SNMP v1 is not a secure way to monitor/maintain your network equipment. Where possible, (it is not in this case) I recommend using SNMP v3. There are several authentication and encryption enhancements in v3 that are well worth implementing to secure your network management setup. You don't have that ability to do so on this gear, because sometimes the lack of newer/more secure features is what you trade off for lower price. 

I don't know if there are any commercial solutions to this problem, (I'm sure there are) we've just been solving this for many years with a little bit of "macguyvering". We take a rack-mount shelf such as this one, and flush mount it to the wall/pressboard in the closet with anchors. Then, we simply put the standard rack ears on our gear, and hang the equipment vertically from the ears of the shelf. We use this in MANY closets as a cheaper/more space efficient alternative to putting a two-post rack or a wall hanging cabinet in there. I've attached a couple of pictures for clarity: 

I would take a look at this support document from Cisco. In part it recommends to run the following command to see which OID's were recently polled: 

You can ALSO turn on causes for auto-recovery, but that is risky if a port was shutdown for BPDUGuard violations, for example. Some possible errdisabled causes you could auto-recover from: 

Since I have the default 7-bit character lengths turned on, it interpreted the æ as angle brackets. Now, I turned on 8 bit character sets and logged out of my session and back in (the logout is necessary to begin using the new terminal settings we just configured): 

I am no expert on these devices, but in looking at the D4E1/D8Eq modules that you reference, it looks like you could possibly take the incoming E1 circuit and break it into two fractional-E1 circuits. Then you could connect one half of the E1 to each router, but you would be permanently halving your throughput on that particular E1. Perhaps you could send 20 channels to the primary router and only 3 to the backup router, instead of splitting the E1 in half exactly. However, two caveats: 1) I would reach out to RAD and ask them if this is a supported/intended use for their device. It is very possible that the device simply muxes/demuxes the circuits, but provides no supervision in the sense that your CPE is currently doing. That is to say, an E1 from your carrier may not be able to establish connectivity when connected to this device. 2) In my opinion, you're fixing the wrong failure scenario. I've seen the carrier's E1/T1 go down FAR, FAR, more often than a failure of the CPE. (This seemed to be true both when I was the carrier and working in the enterprise sector.) I would look at carrier redundancy first, then look into duplicating your edge equipment.
