John T's accepted answer (GNU screen, accessed with ) was what I needed, but I needed a few minutes learning some basics to make it useful. Here is the jump start I needed on key bindings (straight from the man page) - note that you need to install the GNU version for vertical splits (listed after the FAU version that was in my Mavericks). Also, I highly recommend you skim to see what suits your needs. You can always just launch another terminal using screen and then read the manual... Screen version 4.00.03 (FAU) 23-Oct-06 (included in Mavericks and likely similar in earlier) 

PS I had forgotten about this issue as I had worked unrelated items. Today I was running into the issue again and was briefly excited to see somebody had asked before realizing it's my question and that there were no answers, so I had to fumble through it myself. 

I adapted this from Hank Arnold's suggestion at this discussion of mapping local drives. I had guessed that \\myComputerName\c might work, but I didn't know to apply the $. Before you try the "net use" command, try to navigate to to make sure you have 'computerName' correct. 

Additional items with 'Screen version 4.02.01 (GNU) 28-Apr-14' (installed using just now) All of the items listed above in the 4.00.02 (FAU) version, as well as: 

For reference (in case the link disappears), the original said to use the following to clean up, but depending on filesystem type: 

I tested it out and this is great! It excludes plain 'ls' commands from my history without excluding more interesting commands with lengthy paths, but having recently harvested a great deal of wisdom from SU I am eager to know what other commands superusers might recommend or other lessons learned. What can you share about using the HISTIGNORE variable in bash? 

I like for my use case, but my use case is so trivial/simple that it is not laid out very simply in the docs/examples I found. Here is a simple multilog rotate example: 

Differences among .bash_profile/.profile and .bashrc - see excellent discussion at $URL$ Interaction of my local environment with the remote - I debug this by stripping out controlling the local environment, such as with 

You use SUMIF(range,criteria,sum_range), if you do not want to manually enter all of the possible criteria you can use in combination with a H or VLOOKUP(). This is my preference for something like this, easier to adjust and can format your output differently to a pivot table. SUMIF() Reference 

I don't think its a problem Mouse / Keyboard as they are both quite standard devices, which work fine through a Hub connected to any machine and also through the KVM Switch whilst connected to Computer 1. Any help or advice people might have is very welcome - over the years I have had many problems with different KVM's and can never understand why, when simple unpowered USB hubs work fine. 

To create 3D PDF's you need a PDF Printer which supports this, I haven't seen a free piece of software to do this, but there may be one. Try these - 

It could be that the graphics card does not support analogue output. With DVI you can have an analog or a digital signal. With analogue a basic adaptor can convert DVI -> VGA, but if the signal is digital you need an 'active' adaptor. Active adaptors have to convert Digital to Analog so require additional power and are more expensive. I think you may need an active DVI -> VGA adaptor. 

This has been a problem for me for too long, and I have no idea how to resolve. I use a Dell Laptop with a docking station, the 14" Touch Screen has a greater than HD resolution. This means that when using the laptop screen, I have the displayed scaled to 125%. Generally this works well, and when my laptop is docked and connected to my two desk screens (1920x1080) I have the display scaled at 100%. The problem is that randomly some desktop components do not respect the DPI scaling settings. e.g. PowerBI (a Microsoft application!) was working fine for me yesterday while docked. Now today some of the text is wrong, see screenshot. Notice how the popup autocomplete window text is too big, and therefore cutoff. What confuse me is that this was fine yesterday. This issue seems to happen in Visual Studio and other Microsoft products more often than other applications, which is extra frustrating because I'm running their OS (W10 v1511) and their software and it doesnt work!! Any suggestions? 

I was reading the manpages for bash on the plane and I stumbled across the HISTIGNORE variable. To test it out, I immediately edited my .profile to define this variable: 

I found this because I was looking for an improvement over my startup subst scripts - they worked OK, but sometimes executed after folders crashed on startup because my drive wasn't yet mapped. First, I edited the registry, but was unable to get it to work. However, I did come across this alternative, which although it doesn't use subst does answer for me the question, "How to make SUBST mapping persistent across reboots?" Don't use subst... (insert appropriate 'computerName' and 'pathName'): 

I am eager to know how others deal with this, since I don't understand the workaround that I fumbled through (which I'll list if it does not come up in answers). 

I tried 150%, but this caused unacceptable degradation to fonts in certain programs, such as MATLAB. At 125%, I am unhappy with some of the effects, but it is a fair balance to be able to read my email without zooming on every message. On the other hand it is a big downside to overcome deficiencies in one app, so I think I may just switch to this mode when I have a lot of email to read and then switch back - despite logging off and on twice! 

What does this even mean? How should we deal with it? In this case, qfdevelopment_metapkg is an apt package that contains only dependencies in order to install the necessary packages prior to performing development for the qf project. I had installed the package (originally) using: 

I like the general concept in the Macworld article referenced by @Dave, but I don't want to nuke intentionally placed hidden files or folders (especially .git or .svn) and I want to clean up non-msdos filesystems as well as dos. Note that this will cause scripted deletion/destruction of your files, so I recommend you only do this if you pretty much comprehend what this script does and you're OK with potential mayhem. I took their suggested script and changed it as shown below. As they said there, before editing make sure to (so this script can invoke the original umount). After editing, and . 

You need to add the data you have to the data model in excel. Then you can pivot it and do a SUM on the hours. Depending on your version of Excel, you may need to install PowerPivot add in. 

You should notice that the hiberfil.sys is the same size as the RAM you have installed in the machine. 

Use a table in word, fill in the left most column with the question numbers manually then add "a" to "x" in the other cells. Manually set the background colour to black and the text colour to white on the cells you require. If you already have a list of question numbers and the correct answer (a,b,c etc...) then do it in excel using conditional formatting to highlight the correct answer. Then just copy and paste into word. 

I don't understand how / why this will not work, I have a un-powered USB hub which works with all three computers and the two peripherals connected. The keyboard is a DELL KB212-B and Mouse is a classic Microsoft White 5 Button Optical USB InteliMouse. The USB portion of a KVM should be a hub and the parent USB connection gets disconnected and reconnected to the other parent USB port when the switch is pressed? The StarTech manual says to change the following BIOS options, which do not exist in a DELL BIOS : 

Pretty simple question - Why, every time my machine does a Windows 10 feature upgrade, does it lose all my taskbar preferences and what I can do to resolve? 

I have a lab setup on Hyper-V 2016. It was a few servers and two Domain Controllers. I had some issues with the host and noticed that my vm's rebooted randomly with a message unable to connect to VM Storage. The storage was a storage group with 2 1TB HDD's and 4 256 SSD's. I assumed that the Disk IO was just too much and caused the issue so to remove some of the IO load, i removed all the snapshots. (Big Mistake!) I connect to the lab today and both domain controllers are unbootable, looks like they ungracefully shutdown during a windows update - the bit preboot. Tried a couple of reboots, a fix about deleting pending.xml but can't get either of them to boot. Is there anyway to recover a domain controller with no backup, just with access to the hard disk? 

I am about to implement a working copy of /etc/init/subgit.conf (not to be confused with SVN_REPOS/conf/subgit.conf in SubGit) and will post pending better answers. Note: SubGit is a particular implementation of bridging Subversion and Git. 

I am shocked that there isn't a better answer for Outlook 2010 on Windows 7, so I will be checking back. What I settled on is pretty poor: using the "Make it easier to read what's on your screen" feature in Windows 7 and setting an overall magnification to 125%. Unfortunately, you have to log off and log back in in order to see the effect, which makes it a pain to experiment. This feature is accessed in Windows 7 by right-clicking on the desktop, selecting "Screen resolution", and then clicking "Make text and other items larger or smaller" near the bottom. There is also an option to "Set custom text size (DPI)", but I didn't take the time to try it out. You can also access this dialog by typing "Make it easier to read" into the control panel search. 

Why we should care: this issue manifests when a helpfully offers that autoremove will remove all of the just added packages - because the package that depends on them was removed. Workaround It seems that this results from the package not installing anything. I solved the problem by adding a trivial script that I install into the bin directory: 

It seems that upstart is the right way to shut things down and start them up during the reboot process, but I failed to find configuration files with a search of SubGit documentation and a general search of the web. The start and stop commands in my case are as simple as follows, but both username and repo path depend on user installation: 

Now, after installing, the presence of this script causes the apt/deb system to keep the package instead of automatically causing it to disappear. Alternate workaround - without editing deb A different workaround - that does not require modifying the deb - is to just install again at the end to get things squared away: 

You have several options to achieve this, It's hard to say which is best without more information - here's two options... 

I want to view the USB bandwidth usage of different devices on my Windows 10 laptop (1607). I found this article from Microsoft which advises to check in Device Manager, however the Advanced tab doesn't exist when I look at the properties of my USB Host Controller. The controller name is "Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft)" so I thought I might need a less generic driver from Intel. But when I check the Intel site I can only find USB 3.0 drivers for Windows 7 and below. Is there a way on Windows 10 to view the USB bandwidth usage of individual devices? 

I have just tested this on my system and the per app volume setting persisted between closing iTunes and opening it. I have not tried with a reboot, maybe this resets the per-app settings? 

I have this disk partition layout - with 2 working W10 OS's. One on the 40GB partition and one on the 400GB partition. I want to use the additional 34GB in the OS on the 40GB partition. I dont mind reinstalling the OS on the 40GB disk, but want to keep the 400GB W10 OS intact. Is this possible somehow? 

You do not need to change the MBR, if you have two physical hard disks, change their Boot Order in the BIOS so that the Grub Disk boots first. 

I can't say 100% yes or no, but there are some things you may be able to investigate to increase your confidence either way.... What is the maximum output resolution on the mini-display port. Graphics cards have seperate 'heads'. If the maximum display resolution on the head is 2x the monitor resolutions you are using, you can probably use a splitter. If not, probably not. 

If I had to do this, I would do it via option 2 - but I have experience in excel and scripting. I guess you need to weigh up the time involved trying to do it manually vs the time it will take you to work out custom formatting and potentially H or V Lookup in excel.
