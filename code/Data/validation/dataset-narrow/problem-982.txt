Since the upgrade to Ubuntu 9.10 I have issues with getting USB device resets on my Maxtor OneTouch USB harddrive: 

You can't directly merge partitions, but what you can do is just delete the partition and resize the other partition into the new free space. This however requires that the deleted partitions comes directly after the one into which it should be merged. You can list partitions with and manipulate them with cfdisk, fdisk or gparted. If LVM is used, then there is no such restriction, you can just the logical volume and the free storage will automatically returned into the pool of free space in the volume group, which can then be used to resize the existing partition (). To see if LVM is used look at the output of: 

For Linux: If you don't mind a little Python scripting you could write a daemon that listens to HAL for events and then launches a script once a device of your choice has been plugged in. An example script would look like this: 

The device itself continues to work fine, the resets however wake the device out of its sleep state and thus cause it to spin up, which is very annoying. Interestingly, as the log shows, the resets happen at pretty regular intervals (i.e. one hour or half an hour), not randomly. An USB card reader seems to have the same issues, while another USB harddrive from a different manufactor works fine on the same PC. What could be causing this and how could I fix it? 

Every now and then it would be useful to add a command directly to the history in Bash without actually executing it. So far the closed thing I have found is adding a in front of it and hitting return. Are there better ways? 

How widespread is the problem of dead pixels or hot pixels these days? Has the problem become worse with larger monitors and resolutions or become better with better build quality? Do any hardware manifactures handle this problem especially well? Are there any statistics on how many monitors suffer from dead pixel? 

is the easiest way in this case, if for some reason you want to make life more interesting you can use HAL. To list all devices you use: 

You just have to modify the function to limit it to the specific device and replace the call with your custom script. For limiting it to the drive the property could be used and a full list of available properties can be displayed with the program. To start the daemon on boot, just start it from . 

General advise when messing with Grub: Build yourself a grub boot disk first. You can find an iso image in the Ubuntu package and after installing that you can find the file in . Having such a disk handy saves a lot of time when the MBR gets messed up, which happens a lot when installing new OSs. About the install itself, chainloading in step 3 isn't really needed, you could also just start the other OS from within the given grub, but that might require manually adding the boot entries instead of letting the OS generate them automatically (see ). In general I wouldn't waste to much time planing ahead, when you have a grub boot disk ready its trivial to recover from a messed up MBR, just type: 

When it comes to simple CD ISO images it is possible to burn them to a DVD+/-R, but what about the more general case? Is it possible to copy a CD with audio tracks to DVD+/-R? What about mixed mode CDs that contain a data track? What about those old hybrid CD that contain also a Mac filesystem? Using the DVD in a CD-only drive will of course not work, but would it be possible to make it work in a PC that contains a DVD drive? How compatible are CD-R and DVD-R in general? What things does one support that the other doesn't (aside from one having 700MB and the other 4.7GB)? Basically what are the use cases for which one would still need a CD-R in these days and couldn't use a DVD-R as replacement? Edit: And an additional question: Who decides if a CD is an audio-CD or data-CD, is it the OS that interprets the data one way or another or does that difference already happen in the drives firmware? 

Might be faulty RAM or a faulty graphics card. To check the RAM you can use memtest86+, no idea if there is similar software for the graphics card. If you have an old graphics card floating around, you could simply try to use that instead. 

Your rsync command line looks correct ( is needed to keep partially transfered files), you however have to make sure that you are actually using rsync for the data transfer itself by specifing a remote path: 

This used to work fine for years and it still does, except that I am now having issues with a stuck Mode_switch key. When I hit Control_R and Mode_switch at the same time (happens a lot by accident), the Mode_switch key gets into a 'stuck' state, all letters I type afterwards come out in their umlaut form as if Mode_switch is pressed. I can unstuck the Mode_switch by again hitting Control_R and Mode_switch at the same time, but that leaves Gnome in a broken state where it doesn't react to my Gnome keyboard shortcuts any longer. The key presses themselves are still registered by the window manager as one can see changes in the applications (cursor in Gnome Terminal will turn into an unfilled rect, as if the application lost focus), but don't trigger the bound action. Does anybody have a clue what could be causing this? Or does anybody has an idea how I could debug this? xev doesn't seem to help here, as it is reporting normal KeyPress/KeyRelease events, even when the key is stuck. Also the Gnome key bindings don't get reported at all when its in the 'broken' state. I assume they are captured by the window manager before they even reach xev. I am using Ubuntu 10.04 with Gnome and Metacity, I have disabled all OpenGL related effects, so Compiz shouldn't interfere. Some general info on which applications are involved in Gnomes key binding handling would be helpful as well, as I assume its metacity, but restarting metacity doesn't fix the issue. 

In case a PNG of the webpage is enough and you don't need the HTML source, you should be able to use , a small command line utility that comes with Ubuntu. It's however not exactly a feature rich application, so it doesn't offer much customization, it might however be a good starting point for further hacking and thus maybe even allow getting the processed HTML output relatively easily. 

I have an old Athlon 800Mhz PC with a Matrox G450 video card here that is used for watching DVD and video, for most part it works quite fine, but every two seconds the video playback stops for a fraction of a second. It's a tiny but noticeable and annoying glitch. CPU usage doesn't seem to be the problem, there isn't any major IO going on in the background and no obvious background process that could be causing this. Starting the playback with 'nice' or a larger cache () didn't bring any improvements. The machine is running Ubuntu 9.04, under Windows98 the problem does not appear and video is fluent. What could be the cause of this problem and how could I try to debug this further? My current guess would be that its hardware/irq related issue, but thats pretty much just a blind guess. Edit: The problem seems to have disappeared, sadly I have still no idea what solved it or what caused it in the first place.
