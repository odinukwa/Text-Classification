It's time to reboot to make sure that everything works. You may need to update your BIOS boot order settings to match the changes. In my case, the BIOS settings were already correct, so I was stuck in a reboot loop; each time I wanted to boot my computer, I had to manually select the old drive with the misplaced EFI partition. If everything worked as expected, you'll be able to delete the old EFI partition. If it didn't work, or your BIOS is still configured to boot from the old partition, Windows won't let you delete it, even if you use the override flag in diskpart.exe. Since you probably want to get rid of that old partition anyway, deleting it is a great way to make sure you're booting from the new partition. 

Run Disk Cleanup. (You can search for it in the Start menu.) Check . Uncheck everything else. If this works, you can stop. Click . Open the command prompt. Attempt an automated icon cache clear: (prior to Windows 10: ). If this works, you can stop. Kill : Delete a cache: Delete more caches: If thumbnails were also problematic, delete those caches, too:: Start File Explorer back up: 

$URL$ Thanks for all your prompt replies, I decided to install fedora 24 and followed the above guide to install Skype and it worked. 

Link to my script in question I have been working on a script to help me setup my computer after a clean install, and for the most part it has been running relatively smoothly, but by accident I found out that bash scripts can contain functions and I was elated! Naturally I tried it out on one of my more complex scripts and instead of running as it should I got weird results. Mind you I have not encountered any obvious errors, rather the results are completely unexpected. I have for example put one of the results that I got under the conditions of my wireless card being disabled, and after I call my repo function (my complete script is shown in the link above) it skips the command to copy the files and goes straight to asking if I want to install my wireless card which was never called in any of the functions that should have been called. I have given the result of my example below, but the whole script is not running the way it should under any condition. Please help because I am at a loss. I am running fedora 24 64 bit and I will be happy to provide any of all other wanted information or files that are not included in this question. 

Reinstalling the driver seems to have worked. It's possible that simply resetting the device would've had a similar effect. 

Issue 7: Low disk space Unsurprisingly, if your drive is almost full, File Explorer will have issues saving thumbnails and will be rather unhappy about it. The solution here is to clear some space. Simple enough. Issue 8: Windows is borked, proceed to panic Anytime someone mentions this problem on Microsoft Answers, a Microsoft rep always recommends the same solution. I've never heard of it working for anyone, but it can't hurt to try. (Besides, if you contact Microsoft, they're going to tell you to do it anyway.) It could theoretically fix certain obscure issues. 

Issue 5: Windows Setings Sync I've heard that Windows Settings Sync has caused issues with icons for some people. I haven't been able to reproduce this, but you can check whether it's the issue by disabling it temporarily. It's likely that there's either some underlying setting that's the true culprit; it may be resulting in bad icons being uploaded. Reportedly, this primarily affects search results in Cortana and the Start menu. 

I am trying to edit a script so that it will check for an internet connection before executing the rest of its commands, but the problem is that no matter what I try the result (online or not) the answer is always 0 I have provided the code that I came up with below in hopes that someone could look at it and give some ideas on how to solve my plight. I have tried multiple ways with all the same result. I can provide more of the code or my computer information if needed thanks. 

I have created a script that is supposed to (in the below section) store the name and location of their corresponding values in an assigned variable, then list the name variables in a column. I have successfully done this before, but for some reason all I am getting are empty lines. Please help me because I can't seem to make heads or tails of this problem. 

If you ever want to re-enable Defender, change to on both lines. You can download the files to disable and re-enable defender from Gist. 

Updated DNS block list; works as of version . Add this to your hosts file (typically something like ). Works best with IPv6, since is a "drop-all" prefix. Works with IPv4 as long as you don't have anything listening on . You can use , but I would advise against that, since the connection won't die immediately if you have another program listening on port 443. ( is loopback, not just .) 

This may seem like an obscure fix, but the issue stems from the fact that AppX package logos are typically stored as PNG files. When this issue arises, you may also notice that PNG files are lacking proper thumbnails (you won't see previews while browsing folders in File Explorer). If the app causing the problem has installed similar handlers for other image file types, you can perform the same steps as above to the affected file extensions to restore the thumbnails. Keep in mind that this may affect the functionality of the app, so you may have to make a trade-off. Issue 2: Thumbnails are disabled in Performance Settings 

Hey I'm running my shell script that interacts with folders and files, but my $PWD that it keeps pointing to /home/MyUserName directory and this messes with what it is supposed to do. I am running Linux 4.4.8-300.fc23.x86_64 GNU/Linux: 

i ran the proper dnf update command but in the middle of cleanup i got logged out and some of my processes got restarted. on restart nothing new was installed including the new kernel. now dnf won't recognize the missing update packages, it keeps saying that the system is up to date but it isn't. i even tried dnf clean all and that did nothing any help would be greatly appreciated because i would prefer not to reload my computer i literally just loaded it on a side note before the update i edited grub.cfg to remove nomodset from my kernel params, but i don't see how that would affect it 

For years, I've had the exact same issues with app thumbnails. Particularly for Metro-style apps (RT/UWP), I often see a blank or default icon, primarily in search results and settings. I've been troubleshooting it for years, with no success until now. I'm documenting this here because I know I'm going to encounter it again. When I search for a solution, I'll hopefully find this page. Background In Windows 10, UWP apps are shipped as AppX packages. This includes many of the new built-in apps (stored in ) as well as apps downloaded via Windows Store (stored in ). PowerShell offers several cmdlets that are useful for managing AppX packages. Throughout my troubleshooting, I found Get-AppxPackage, Add-AppxPackage, and Remove-AppxPackage particularly useful, especially since is inaccessible to normal users, even administrators. Before attempting these fixes, you should be comfortable editing the registry, working with the command prompt and PowerShell, and making backups. You should be prepared to wipe everything and reinstall Windows should something go wrong. Issue 1: Third-party thumbnail handlers for .png Some third-party apps like to install custom thumbnail generators. Some of these apps do so in a way that breaks things. In my case, Google's Drive File Stream was the culprit. Keep in mind that this is different from having a default program for a file; Windows Photos remained the default for me. To solve the issue:
