The optimal process involves many tools that can give you a detailed view over the server. The more informations you can get, from different sources, the easy will be to identify the cause. You can check the logs for any problems that occurs during the time when this happens. As well, some basic informations are available in Munin. As well, you can install NewRelic to have a more clear picture over the process list and I/O status during the high load. This will show you which project caused the high load. As well, you can check logstash for logs or logentries You mention that you also use well known frameworks. Check if you are allocating enough RAM for them. I presume that most of them use a database. Is the DB server installed on the same machine? Is it on a dedicated machine? Are you using any sort of caching (Varnish, APC, etc..) ? 

I have an e-mail server powered by Postfix. Aside from traditional e-mail accounts on my server, I want to maintain some accounts whose only role is to forward all incoming mail to differnet address on different mail system. For example. I own domain and I set account with address on my server. And I want this one account to forward all incoming messages to mailbox in different mail system, in domain that does not belong to me . I know, that i can add an entry in in my lookup table. 

I have a SOLR Master and a Slave running. After upgrading to SOLR 4.10.2, and fixing all other errors, I cannot get pass this one: 

Search for files in /target_directory and all its sub-directories, that have been modified in the last 2 days: 

Strictly to your question: 1) yes 2) have a look at the log files for those services under /var/log . The second part of the question depends on what you will find in the log files and trace the cause of this behaviour. 3) you can use monit -> $URL$ From the website: 

You can olso view X-Powered-By header using some browser add-ons, for example "Live HTTP Headers" add-on to Mozilla Firefox. However most production servers doesn't include X-Powered-By header. 

Suppose we have Windows Server 2008 R2 without any RDS CAL's. Is it possible to give access to Remote Desktop to a user which is not in 'Administrators' group ? I've tried everything and it seems that it is not, but I may be wrong. 

? Is there a real difference in operation or is just a way to enforce this restriction when some of rules listed in results in ? 

From the logs you can see the the session is timing out. That's why your transfer gets aborted. Increase the timeout value. 

There is only so much you can do with bash. However for TUI progarms you can do pretty much everything you need with ncurses. $URL$ There are wrappers over the C functions provided by curses; if youâ€™re already familiar with curses programming in C. 

As detailed @ $URL$ Search for files in /target_directory and all its sub-directories, that have been modified in the last 60 minutes: 

Problem may be in Your Cyrus settings or in PAM settings ( probably Cyrus SASL uses PAM to communicate with MySQL in Your setup ). I advise You two things: 

Of course now we can pipe it to use it's output. I just wonder why I have to press "Enter" two times in my SSH session after typing the command for it to work. 

I have Windows Server 2003 with CopSSH installed on it ( Cygwin + sshd ). W would like to be able to run a PowerShell script via SSH session command and then use it's output. Is there such capability ? How to do it ? 

The issue persists. I have also tried other solutions, like changing the following into the solrconfig.xml: 

This caused different errors, so I rolled back to (the above part is now commented out. I have compared the configuration files with an environment that works and they look identical. Thank you. 

All these commands so far only print out the locations of files that are matched. You can also get detailed file attributes of recently modified files, using "-exec" option as follows. To search for files in /target_directory (and all its sub-directories) that have been modified in the last 60 minutes, and print out their file attributes: 

I am trying to configure Postfix so that it would accept mail from authenticated clients outside . When I try to send a test email from my iPhone, which is configured to use port 25, SSL and password authentication, the mail gets rejected by Postfix. I get the following in : 

After much experimentation it turned out I had to add to (not to be confused with ). This has fixed it. 

I am seeing the following messages in my server's . They look like stack traces and are not preceded by any narrative (e.g. "such-and-such has gone wrong"). I am almost certain they are related to I/O problems I am experiencing, but it would be instructive to understand what exactly these messages are and what triggers them. 

I have a LAN behind a Linksys RV016 Router. It is connected to the internet with DSL line with asymetric parameters 2Mbit download / 512 kbit upload. In this LAN I have MS SQL server, and i want to connect to it remotely via VPN. To do this I use my RV016 router's PPTP function. Connection works fine, but ... little to slow. And here is my question: what may be the bottleneck - is it only my DSL line's speed parameters ? Or may it be caused ALSO by router's hardware parameters (processor, RAM) ? In that case is it reasonalbe to set additional server VPN server inside the LAN, so that router only forwars communication on appropriate port and the rest is up to VPN server ? 

The plan for the two WAN interfaces is as follows. All outbound traffic will go to the primary, with exceptions based on destination IP/subnet or possibly on src+dest IPs/subnets. Such exceptions should be routed to the secondary. It would be very nice if, should the primary go down, the secondary would automatically take over for all outbound traffic. I am reasonably sure that I can put something together based on dd-wrt. However, I'd like to hear from you what alternatives are out there (especially something easier to set up for my use case, even if it means paying more for the hardware.) 

First thing it is good to add PowerShell's executable path to user's PATH environmental variable. We do it by adding to user's .bashrc file line like: 

But I'm worried that to deliver message, Postfix will use original envelope sender address. It's okay if sender is from domain example.com that belongs to me, but otherwise server may classify this message as a spam. Is there some way, to alter envelope sender on delivery ? Are ment for this ? If so, is it okay, that my server sends an e-mail using specific envelope sender, and then something else in message being forwarded ? How else to deal with such problem ?
