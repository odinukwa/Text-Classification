Unless you have a very compelling reason, I would split off some of your services on VM2, so that a problem in SQL doesn't knock out your file server, filling the file server knocks out your IIS, etc. With the thin-provisioned disk (as ewwhite recommends), you should still have plenty of room for everything. 

This is a bit of a broad question, so this is a broad-stroked answer. In general, a NAS is more of an appliance than a server. The OS is not as full featured as a dedicated server OS, but it has an interface to let you share files. A common feature is to have different RAID levels (0 & 1 almost always, 10 and 5 common) available for data availability. This increases uptime, since a single drive failure (other than RAID 0) will allow you to continue to work. It is not backup, since if you lose the NAS in a fire, you've lost everything. There are plenty of other features, but I'm sure that there are other better descriptions of NAS elsewhere. The good news is that less features generally means less care and feeding over time. But there's also less functionality as well. You won't necessarily be able to install any arbitrary application on it, like SQL Server. In your case, since you're talking about a file-server replacing NT (!), a simple NAS may be worth considering. The big questions that only you can answer are how much downtime are you willing to accept, and how much are you willing to spend to mitigate that risk. 

I have a VPN to my work which is quite fast... I Remote Desktop to my work PC, which is running a Microsoft Virtual PC. Working with the PC while I'm actually at work isn't too bad, but when I try to interact with it over the remote desktop, it is VERY slow to respond. Even simple typing can be slow, but screen painting and response time is painfully obvious. Any suggestions to help speed it up? 

I have a production MS SQL Server 2005 DB that I have recently become an "unintentional DB Admin" for... while poking around the settings for the DB I found that it has the default AutoGrow settings of 1MB. I've read (and generally believe) that this is not an appropriate setting - the DB is 14GB large. I'm willing (and likely) to change it, but my question is... If no one noticed it in all of the years we've been using it (especially users), why should I change it now? To put it another way, I guess I understand on a basic level why 1MB is too small - it's probably autogrowing often, perhaps daily or several times a day - but I'm thinking "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". What specific justifications are there to increase the autogrow? Does it lock users out while autogrowing? Does it re-index? Does the DB do anything besides just add more disk space to the DB? 

I'm at my wits' end on this one. Scenario End-user is trying to print at home to her wireless printer, a LaserJet Pro M1217nfw. Every time she tries to connect, it asks for admin privileges to install the driver. After some research, I find this article: $URL$ I make the changes to the two printer classes in Group Policy. I've ensured that the GPO has been applied to the laptop. Using a laptop with the same GPO, I was able to get my home USB printer to connect (using my normal user privs, no elevation). Great! When my user tries it at home, though, she isn't able to get any farther than a UAC prompt. This happens when she tries to do this wirelessly or via a USB port to tes. My theory is that I need to add another device type. If there is a way for me to determine what Device Class that printer is asking for, I suspect I could just add the GUIDs to the GPO, but I don't know how to determine that. Nothing is leaping out at me in Event Viewer. So: 1.) What am I doing wrong for laptops accessing home printers? OR 1A.) Is this not a best practice at all to let users install printers on work laptops? If that's the case, how do you manage users' home printing? 2.) If my solution is just to add a Device Class, how do I find out what Device Class a peripheral is identifying itself? 

Basically, I don't care about fragmentation on the disk as a whole, I'm just curious about one file in particular... in my case, a SQL database and transaction log file. I'm looking for something that will provide very basic statistics - number of fragments, average fragement size, etc. I'm NOT looking for fragmentation statistics of the SQL data / indexes - I already know how to get that. 

Somehow my desktop system has been infected with Roxio Media Manager... I say it that way only because the MSI is continually executing on my system and I can't make it stop. The install never succeeds because it apparently needs some resource that it can't access for whatever reason. I can cancel the install, but a few minutes later it starts up on it's own again. The only thing I've found that works is to just leave the installer running in a failed mode, but that stops me from running any other MSI based installs or uninstalls. I think this started happening after I uninstalled a bunch of software that I don't use from my machine, but I'm not 100% sure. I've checked everything I can think of but ... there are NO Roxio anythings in my list of Add/Remove programs, I've run MSCONFIG to check startup files and there's no sign there of anything Roxio related (that's active, anyway). I've disabled any/all services that have "Rox" anywhere in the title. Is there anywhere else that I should check to try to figure out why this MSI is constantly trying to install itself? I'm nearing the point of wiping my machine and starting over from scratch.
