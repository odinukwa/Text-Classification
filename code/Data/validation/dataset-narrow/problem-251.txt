Is it good to reclaim space using resizing datafiles? What are the things to be taken care before resizing the datafile? 

I have Percona Server 5.6 running in linux platform.. recently I faced an issue where mysql instance was continuously restarting for no reason.. mysql logs had this error: 

Apparently, the issue was with the OS variables. I tried increasing open files parameter for mysql user from the default to 5000. Restoration worked just fine. 

Those mysql exporter and node exporters of Prometheus which I need to deploy in my database host - what would be overhead of them? Resource intensive? I did go through Nagios as well - Is Nagios better than Grafana and is it possible to use Grafana with Nagios? 

My Container database (CDBROOT) is showing as read-write mode and while my pluggable database is showing as mount-state. Does that mean the application is using the container database and not the pluggable? Also, is it possible to move back to the non-container database architecture? 

I need to make log-bin-trust-function-creators persistent so that I need not make it to true everytime on instance restart. 

Please note I have not given scan exclude and scan order in both the nodes inspite of this being multipathed disks, yet the same is getting mounted in node 1 but not in node 2. What could be the issue? 

I have a Percona MySQL database 5.6 running in a linux machine. I have created new users called test1 and test2. What I did was I imported mysql database from my test setup to this new setup. After which when I run the query 

I have enabled default auditing in one of my database. Oracle 11g. Audit_trail is set to DB, other than that for a particular schema 'test' I have set: 

I have an three node AlwaysOn AG setup, running on SQL Server 2012 SP3 in Windows Server 2012 R2. Node 1 and Node 2 are in the same physical location. Node 2 is the secondary replica. Third node acts as a DR, in a different location. I have setup this system without shared storage and it is running on VMs. For cluster quorom, I have not added a witness or file share which MSFT says it is recommended irrespective number of nodes in Windows Server 2012R2. Here in my case, number of nodes is 3 and for odd number of votes, quorom is node majority. Is witness required in my scenario? What risks do I face here without witness? The reason i'm asking this is because we had an Microsoft's assessment tool run in this setup which prompted that one of the critical observation in this that Witness or file share is not available. I'm trying to understand why it is a concern. Recently, one of my nodes got evicted because of VM level issue, production was live only one of the nodes. Total votes was 2. Cluster did not go down. Now in what scenario this witness would have helped me? Considering I do not have a shared disk for AlwaysOn, I'm not in a situation to add a witness which should be a shared drive I suppose (correct me if I'm wrong). Links that I referred to: 

Platform - RHEL. Database - 11.2.0.3. I have a diskgroup name TEST with AU as 1. I need to have the diskgroup with AU as 4 therefore I decided to drop the existing DG and recreate the new one with required AU. I dropped the existing DG, it got dropped just fine. When I try to create new diskgoups with same name, it gives me error as below: 

Stop the slaves in B, C and D. Stop A and change the port in A to 3360 and start A. Stop B and change the port in B to 3360. Ensure skip slave start is set to true. Start B and run change master to master_port=3360 and start slave. In C, run the same as step 4. Start slave in D. 

I have many databases for which I have configured data guard setup. When it comes to monitoring the standby's, I use OEM to check the lag and I have enabled mail alerts as well as and when gap is more than 50 archives. But the thing what I recently observed is that in one of my standby databases my recovery got stopped for one or more reasons and unfortunately lag also did not go above 50 so there was no alerts. In such a situation how I can ensure when my standby's recovery MRP itself is not active and I should be alerted in such a situation.. How is it possible? Any soultions? 

I have set the file size for the user mysql as unlimited in /etc/security/limits.conf. Timeout values: 

Okay first things first, this is probably a common issue which gets resolved going through all those questions and googling it but still I face this issue: 

Should I need to enable ? If I enable this, will I be able to take binary log backups from my passive master? If I enable it in passive master, I should not enable the same on active master right? 

But no-luck! Does sql-developer needs any tweaks for connecting to RAC scan-ip's? I have tried all the possible the answers in SE and googled. Thing is i'm trying to connect to the database through one PC but not every PC. What could be the possible issues? How to go about debugging? 

I have a OS user 'test' who doesn't belong to dba group or oinstall group. I need to access the database using sqlplus but I'm unable to access the sqlplus even after setting oracle home ans path and tnsnames. Any solution? 

InnoDB buffer pool cache should be in bytes only or it can be in G (currently I have set 12G and it is not working). Should I change to bytes? In my.cnf, does the order in which the variables are given matters? or it takes randomly? Say, I can give buffer pool in the last in [mysqld] and InnoDB buffer size as first - does it matter? 

I have setup Master-Master replication on two servers. Now, my question is that if I need to have the second master as only read-only, what should I do? I tried doing 

This one says without witness, cluster will survive until last node One from MSDN blog says that Always configure a witness irrespective of nodes 

I have the need to find top resource consuming queries in my Percona 5.6 server so that those queries can be fine tuned to improve the performance of the database. Also, is it possible to get the history of highly resource intensive queries for the past 3 days? Is it possible to fetch the info from the logs? Thanks.!
