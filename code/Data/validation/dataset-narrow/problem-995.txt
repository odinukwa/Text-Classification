I tried this right now. I used 7-Zip to create an AES-256 encrypted *.zip (PKZip) file and then open it in Windows 10 File Explorer. I'm using Windows 10 1709 (OS build 16299.125) aka "Fall Creator's Update". File Explorer listed the files in the zip file correctly (this is expected as zip files do not encrypt filenames), but gave me an error when attempting to extract a file: 

However Windows does not pick an actual colour from the wallpaper, instead it picks from its internal palette of about 8 colours, some of which are nice, but others are rather unattractive, such as the "vomit brown" you can see in my screenshot example, even though my current wallpaper is blue and amber. Is there a way to set the colours in that palette? Are they stored in the registry somewhere or as an embedded resource somewhere else? I couldn't see anything relevant in unfortunately. 

In my organization I'm a member of many distribution lists, I have a rule for each DL/ML such that each message is delivered to a subfolder for that DL, however it's important that any messages sent to a distribution list, but containing my name in the , , or in the message body are delivered to my Inbox and not my distribution list subfolders. I have a rule set up in my Exchange (Office 365) account that looks like this: 

As for your specific question: it's likely you simply have the processor built-in GPU disabled in your EFI/BIOS setup area. You said that your motherboard already has an ASPEED GPU built-in, so I'll bet your motherboard is configured to disable the CPU-integrated graphics and to substitute ASPEED instead (this may be preferable for many reasons). If you disable the ASPEED graphics then the system should default back to the Intel CPU-integrated graphics. For further reading, search for "Intel Graphics Technology Interface". 

Today I upgraded to the Creators Update by running setup from the ISO mounted locally. When I got back to my computer I opened Task Manager and saw my memory usage was a lot higher than it was previously (it's now almost 6GB memory usage at idle after logging in instead of 2-3GB with the previous Windows build) - the processes tab revealed that there were upwards of 60 different instances of running. This 6GB figure is just for process memory - not including memory used for caching or "standby". I ran to get a listing of which services were in which processes and it lists almost every svchost.exe instance as only having one running service contained within (with the exception of a handful of instances that are running a few system services). Here's my output: 

The messages referring to "Equation 3.0" is shorthand for the "Microsoft Equation Editor" which was an OLE component. It was a rebranded, cut-down version of Design Science's MathType editor. OLE components are small binary programs that are loaded into an existing process (usually office/'productivity' programs) which then display an inline UI. It was popular in the 1990s as a way to allow users to "embed" content from other programs into Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, etc - this is what happens if you copy cells from an Excel spreadsheet and paste into a Word document, then double-click to edit it in-place. This technology eventually became COM (and COM+ and DCOM, led to the .NET Framework, and now is the basis for WinMD/WinRT in Windows 8 and Windows 10 - it's come a long way). Anyway, because these components are binary programs in their own right, it means they must match the instruction-set architecture of the host process. If you're running 64-bit (AMD64) Office, then you need an AMD64 build of the Equation Editor. ...unfortunately, such a build does not exist (probably because it's too old and unmaintained to rebuild, or Microsoft doesn't have a license to the source code from Design Science anymore). So you'll need to use the 32-bit version of the Equation Editor, which only works in the 32-bit version of Office. You can install the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Office side-by-side, but I recommend instead creating a simple VM (virtual-machine) to install an older 'good' version of 32-bit Office to act as a format-bridge (Office 2010 is my personal favourite). From within a 32-bit install of Office, you'll need to manually convert the Equation object to use Word's new Equation system - have fun, it isn't easy! 

My Dell XPS laptop has a touchscreen that I do use sometimes (to scroll webpages, for example) - because Windows 10 recognises the presence of a touch-screen it renders the Taskbar context-menus and notification area with wider spacing to make them easier touch-targets, but it wastes space for me because only really use the mouse/touchpad. Disabling the touchscreen device in Device Manager causes Windows to render the taskbar normally, but I don't like losing functionality that way. Is there a way to retain the use of my touchscreen, but have the taskbar rendered with normal spacing? 

I don't know Autohotkey myself, but you'll need to write a simple script that sets this registry value before launching the new process. 

This is a very similar problem to this QA ( How can I delete a file that "Does not exist" ), except I'm on an entirely Windows computer, whereas the OP in that question was SSHing to a NAS running Linux. I was using with GitKraken and was performing a merge that I later aborted. During the merge I was diffing two files from two commits in the same branch and (or GitKraken - I'm not sure who was responsible for the file, exactly) created two files on-disk representing a merge-conflicted file, each file represents the file's state from each commit. When I was done, I tried to delete the files (it failed to clean-up after itself) - one of the two files was deleted successfully, but the other file cannot be deleted. 

I've recently gotten a new job on the other side of the planet. Exciting stuff. But then I need to concern myself with my data. My computer set-up is as follows: 

I have an Excel spreadsheet showing the balance of a bank account over time. Each data-point is the balance of the account immediately after a transaction (so there might be several per day, with the date+time it happened, or there might be weeks with no data because the balance remained constant with no transactions). When I create an X/Y Scatter or Line chart with Excel, the series line is comprised of straight lines directly between two sample points. This line, therefore, is meaningless because in real-life there is no "midpoint" between two balance points: the balance remains flat until the next transaction. Is there any way to have Excel create charts with flat, horizontal lines between data points in a chart? 

In my spreadsheet the column is hidden because I recalculate it myself. I want to have a summary for each month with data looking like this: 

No, it does not. The Dell PERC H310 is a rebadged "LSI SAS 2008" RAID controller. As the name suggests, it was released around 2008/2009. The 4K Native specification was completed in 2010, two years after the LSI SAS 2008 (and H310) were initially released. There were no firmware updates released by either LSI or Dell to retroactively enable 4K "Advanced Format" mode. I note that Microsoft didn't support 4K in Windows until Windows 8 and Server 2012 in 2012. For most use-cases the performance and capacity benefits of 4K formatting are not particularly spectacular and really depend on your whole system stack (drives, controllers, operating system, and running applications) to be specifically designed to benefit - this article from 2010 running Windows 7 shows marginal improvements at-best: $URL$ In summary: "No, but don't sweat it." 

At first-glance, this rule seems fine - except that it applies the operator, so logically only messages with my name simultaneously in , , and the body will be moved to my inbox. Surprisingly this does happen - but it means that a lot of messages fall through the cracks. Rather than creating one rule for each, is there a way to change it so these predicates are applied with the operator instead of ? I'm using Office 365 Exchange so I can't use VBA rules (which, in my understanding, run on the client). 

This diagram is included in this technical paper that details the graphics-processor in the same processor, though it does not go into detail about the Display Controller component. 

In the screenshot above in Excel I have opened a CSV file of money transactions from my bank. The transaction date is in column , the amount in , and the bank's computed balance in . I'm computing my own running balance in column () and column provides a highlight to indicate any discrepancies (, unfortunately as the screenshot shows, Excel is saying that does not equal . I wanted to see if there was a rounding-error going on, so in column I set the formula and then expanded the number of decimal places shown. Which shows a minute error of . Question 1: Where is this insignificant error coming from, and why does Excel suddenly consider the values different in row 206? Question 2: Other rows have an identical discrepancy (e.g. 188 and 184 vs. row 206) so why does Excel complain all of a sudden? Question 3: Why isn't Excel treating currency values as integral values and not floating-point, so there shouldn't be any error at all. 

I am using the first-party Slack desktop client for Windows. Other systems, like Lync (Skype for Business), Skype, all the way back to MSN Messenger, allowed me to receive notifications when contacts came online. As Slack works on a disconnected model across all of a users' devices the concept of "coming online" or "going offline" / "signing out" doesn't really apply to Slack, but Slack does still classify users as being online/available, idle, away and sleeping. And to my surprise, there doesn't seem to be a way to tell Slack to notify me if a particular contact changes status, or specifically, is no-longer marked as away or not-signed-in-on-any-device. Searching online for "slack notify when someone comes online" just yields irrelevant articles listing UI features of Slack that I was already aware of. Interestingly, Slack's own API does expose presence events, e.g. $URL$ - I'm just surprised the official client won't let me as a user subscribe to them. Update I suppose this is intentional - it isn't Slack-like to require these notifications: the scenario is that you want to be notified so that you know you can talk to someone - because if they're not online you cannot send them messages (Offline Messaging support in MSN Messenger and Skype notwithstanding). Given that Slack will deliver the message to their client software, especially mobile devices, regardless, it means all you need to do is send the message you want to send them anyway and wait for your recipient to reply... eventually. The problem with this approach is that sometimes you want to talk to someone without wanting to seem like you want to - there's also the problem of decorum: I could send my boss a message at 3am and wait for his reply at 9am - but I don't want him to think I'm up on SuperUser.com at 3am... 

I know you can configure individual services to run in their own instance of svc with the command, but to my knowledge I've never run this command. I took a quick look at and it looks like the key values for most of these services is missing the flag bit at which controls if a service runs in its own instance or not. I wonder what could have effected this change. Has anyone else observed this behaviour before or after installing Windows 10 Creators Update? If it is a default configuration change, will it have any implications on system performance or stability? I suspect it will increase system stability because if a service crashes it won't bring down other services - but this comes at a massive cost of RAM - but I've never experienced a service crashing on me - or at least ever noticed it (instead the worst problem I've had is with consuming 100% CPU for hours on end - and that's not a problem process isolation will solve). (I just noticed: they finally added an address bar to the Registry Editor!) 

When Google Chrome profiles were introduced in 2014 they had a Lock feature where you'd need to enter a password to use that profile. My workplace has a number of shared machines (e.g. conference room computers, kiosk computers, etc) where we don't have unique user accounts, instead we switch our Chrome profiles using the titlebar menu to access our own Gmail / StackOverflow / GitHub / etc. As some of these machines aren't very secure, I'd like to "lock" at least my account by requiring a password before someone can click on my profile picture. I've seen articles online from 2014 and 2015 that describe it, but I don't see the Lock button anywhere: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

According to various leaks ( $URL$ ) and ( $URL$ ) the CPU frequencies of the upcoming Broadwell-E i7-6000 processors are as follows: 

I have a Table (as opposed to a Range) defined in Excel 2010, named . The table has blank rows separating groups of 3 to 5 rows with data. Note that not every column in every "non-blank" row contains data. However data exists in column B (named ) for every non-blank row. I want to format the table (either using Conditional Formatting or static formatting) such that all of the all-blank rows have an off-white background color. So far I've tried the following Conditional Formatting rules with no luck:
