It seems as this isn't impossible but I haven't found any software that does this, except this one, but it isn't even released yet: vBoot. My objective is: 

In Google Chrome's , I see an opton labeled "Run PPAPI Flash In The Renderer Proces". The only resource I've found is that PPAPI, "Pepper", is an alternative to Netscape's NPAPI. My questions are: 

This is a long story so I'll try to trim it down, please ask for any information. This machine is running Linux Mint Debian, it's an ASUS A7N266-VM with GeForce2 Integrated Graphics [NVCrush11] that is targeted by the legacy drivers. So, there I went to compile it. I booted into text mode, had the (.run) installer disable nouveau (which worked fine), rebooted (again in text mode), had the installer compile and set up the driver, and rebooted into text mode. Suffice to say it was a mess of garbage, so I read the manual (again), looking for what it could be. It says something about AGP, so I disabled AGP with X server configuration option to 0, and while the garbage on the screen was less pronounced, it still looks like this: 

It's ok if I have to get used to new tools (up to date VirtualBox solved all my needs). It's also ok if I have to deal with scripting, even some coding, or anything that can help me achieve that task, as it would be very useful to have a portable WinXP VM that I can boot into. In a nutshell: to run VirtualBox/VMWare/other XP image without booting into a preinstalled OS. 

I'd say: try the first option, and if that works then switch to the system-wide settings to see if things change? 

Using Automator's Folder Actions you could run such commands for new files in a specific folder, if that's what you after. 

Try to boot into Safe Mode, by holding down Shift while starting your Mac. From Mac OS X: What is Safe Boot, Safe Mode?: 

...and compare it to the metadata of a file that opens as expected. Maybe , or show something odd? (Some shameless plug for Apple Mail, and surely not an answer to your question, so just in case you cannot fix it and are considering if you should kiss Thunderbird goodbye: Apple Mail works fine with the Energy Saver –Thunderbird always kept my Macs from sleeping, but haven't used it for 3 years– and is Time-Machine-aware. When entering Time Machine while Mail is active, you'll get the galaxy thingy for Mail rather than for Finder. You can then even find messages for accounts that don't exist anymore, and to restore them you don't need to know how Mail stores the messages on your hard disk.) 

Hence, modifying a file while not changing file size or date, keeps Time Machine oblivious of file changes. But maybe that only applies to comparing the last backup against the current state on disk. If you do not see the file in the last backup at all, then Time Machine cannot compare the current file to the last backup either. Or, if the folder has not changed for a long time, then Time Machine will skip it altogether. So, maybe you just need to make Time Machine process that file's folder again. Simply add a file to that same folder and remove it, which will add the name of that folder to the FSEvents database. Then, when Time Machine runs, it will surely know that the folder needs processing. If it then only looks at files that were created after the last backup then this won't help you. But maybe it really checks the existence of each file in that folder, hence copying the missing files to the backup after all. Just give it a try. If just poking the folder doesn't work, then all you can do is change the file date. If you're okay with that, then the command can do that: 

I'd expect problems (and wouldn't do that). It's likely that it could happen, do you have any need to do such a restore? Now, I'd never recommend system restore. It happened to me that I had files that it deleted, sometimes I didn't knew what it was doing, and others, it didn't restore what it should. If you can, move your data to a separate drive/partition, periodically make backups (especially of your most important data), and reformat your windows partition once in a while, better yet, keep a system image ready to recover from. But if you insist, make a drive image, try to do the restore, and if it fails, restore it. 

I'm running Tomboy on Windows, and altough it lets me change "the font", that setting only affects the main font, while the monospaced font is preset to Courier New. Courier New really hurts my eyes badly, like it was some Papyrus-ComicSans half-breed. I want to set it to Ubuntu Mono. How can I do this? 

So, how can I find out which versions are avaliable for on a specific repository, or in all repositories in my ? 

Many of them seem to be useless, but accortding to the last post here post, Windows XP expect these files to be there: 

Ok, this might sound ridiculous, but of all the issues I could have, I'm scratching my head over booting into text mode. Normally I'm in the opposite direction, such as not working. To put the wtf-level of this into perspective, I just managed to run Photoshop CS5 without problems (I'm trying to go into text mode to install nVidia graphics drivers). Speaking of levels, the runlevels concept is confusing me; Debian seems to have a default runlevel of 2 - in the readme for the drivers it says such a runlevel would be text mode, and not even have networking (and that the "default" would be 5). Just to clear that up, on this Debian, says: 

Some online services like Dropbox will try to save a new revision whenever you hit Save (if the document is in the Dropbox folder). 

Your browser needs to know an IP address, while the server then needs more details as for which site to serve. So, to host multiple sites on you cannot serve all of them at or . Instead: 

Hardly a native app, but spreadsheets like OpenOffice.org Calc and Microsoft Excel might help? Just remember that the default time formats† such as will show 26 hours as , and minus 2 hours as or . To avoid that: Use square brackets in the format, for both the inputs and the results:. Then all you need is the function: 

Without knowing what devices you use: if one of them (preferably the wireless router) supports "bridging mode" then that device can be thought of as being some kind of "slave". The other device will then take care of assigning IP addresses and the routing; the "slave" will just take care of passing everything to that device. This will solve a lot of problems in one go (like "double-NAT" issues). Unfortunately, the term "bridging" is used in many different meanings, like an Apple AirPort Express can act as a bridge in three different ways: 

This shows the row number minus 1 if the value in the same row in is positive, or an empty cell otherwise. Subtracting 1 converts rows 2 thru 8 into a position of 1 to 7, to ignore the first header row. So, now we know that the 1st, 4th, 5th and 7th values from are positive. Next, in : 

My question is, does any software do this kind of thing? Any way I could do it (I'd be happy enough to get the CRC, the drive's "wrong" data, know which is the offending block/sector there, and write a script to brute it myself, if relevant directions are given). By the way, this is a mechanical HDD. Edit: After taking a look with hex editors and such, I noticed that a bad block appears as garbage, such as filled with zeros or a copy of the last block (this seems to depend on the program), so in order to get the "real data" that is corrupted, we'd have to disable some hardware-correction that refuses to read a block which is bad. I believe this is called ECC. Also, I expect that if just a few bits are marking a block as "bad", then some 32-bit checksum from Windows could be used to brute force a match. So this question may be answered simply with guidance to do this by myself. 

                                      Could anybody tell me a sane, simple way of booting into text-mode on this Debian-based distro? 

But it's so bad it's not even worth it. Sorry nVidia folks, you suck at making a driver for your own board. I know it's an old board, but nouveau drivers are quite better. 

I've tried adjusting the timings (e.g., ), but even if it did report the change (by calling again), nothing changed - changing e.g., , on the other hand, caused visible results (screen clipping). The display module is . gives me: 

Make sure you have no filtering enabled, which should then show ... messages are hidden by filters on top of the console output: 

Given the problems some people reported with printers during (early adopter) updates from 10.5 to 10.6, I'd not try to migrate the drivers... Just plug-in the printers and see what happens? 

Run Time Machine at 10 am. Add some files to your Mac at 11 am. Run Time Machine at 1 pm. The files from step 2 will be added. Delete the files you created in step 2 from your Mac. Run Time Machine at 2 pm. The files from step 2, written to the backup in step 3, will still be on the backup, but no longer on your Mac. Run Time Machine at 11 am next day. All yesterday's backups will be deleted, except for the first which was created in step 1. Hence, your backup no longer holds the files you created in step 2 (and were deleted from your Mac in step 4). 

So, if anyone here knows about it: edit that page! However, that very same Windows section does list other options, some of which apparently "fall back to implementing a FUSE compatibility layer on top of FIFS which implements a SMB server to provide access to other filesystems". I doubt it's useful, but if all else fails then looking at that list might help. It seems that Dokan might be a good FUSE-like alternative for Windows, especially for SSH/SFTP. (And, when really taking things to extremes, one could even use DeleGate as a FTP-to-SFTP gateway, just in case one finds something that only supports FTP...)
