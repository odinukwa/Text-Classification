Am I right thinking that UEFI and GPT completely deprecate all the CHS/MBR legacy and eliminate all the sector size related problems (alignment, max drive size, etc.) as well as partitioning limitations (like the maximum of 4 primary partitions)? 

I have created a dynamic TrueCrypt volume file, set it size to 40 GiB and put about 20 GiB of files on it. When I open the volume file properties it says "Size: 40.0 GB, Size on disk: 23.0 GB". When I try to move the volume file to another physical partition it takes a lot of time as it tries to copy all the 40 GB instead of just 20 GB that the volume file actually takes. Also, when it is less than 40 GB free on the target drive it says insufficient space even though it is more than enough space considering how much does the image file actually take. How do I overcome this? Creating a new volume file on the target drive works but needless to say I'd like a better solution. 

I have got a WMV (v9 (WMV3), 960x720, 30.000030 fps, planar 4:2:0 YUV, produced by PowerPoint 2010) file and need to convert it to MPEG2 - the only format my TVset can read from an USB flash drive (I have also tried MP4/h.264, AVI/XVID - nothing but MPEG2 works). I have managed to to the job with simple 

Linux XWindow system has a pretty convenient (IMHO) feature - instead of using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V all the time, I can just select what I want to copy-paste and wheel-click where I want to paste it. Can I reach the same behaviour in Windows XP without using a mouse vendor-specific driver/tool? 

Whenever I run a CPU-heavy activity (like compressing a big set of files into an archive for example) my CPU switches to its full throttle (maximum frequency) and shuts down of overheat in less than a minute. Instead, I would like it to keep slowed-down slightly to do the task a bit slower but be able to reach the finish. At the same time I don't want to dim my screen brightness or adjust anything else what standard Windows power-saving system does. So how do I actually set a cap to limit my CPU power? The CPU is Core 2 Duo T7250, the OS is Windows 7 32-bit, there seem to be no BIOS settings or jumpers available to configure the frequencies. 

When I look into my Firefox history trying to find a page I've visited recently, the history is usually overwhelmed with google.com search, GMail, Google+ and Google Reader pages (and some other pages equally useless to account). Is there a way (an extension perhaps) to fight this? 

And this seems to work if... I edit a cell to remove a hidden single-quote from its beginning (which serves to protect a cell content from being interpreted) as all the newly formatted cells now store values like 

I have got both GnuWin32 and cygwin installed, but I seek a solution that will work in Windows command line promt (and so will be callable from Totat Commander), not in cygwin command line promt. 

UPDATE: I've found out that you don't even need to create an Explorer shortcut. Just put the avatar folder wherever you want (as I've said, it is needed to remain there) and drag it into the Start menu. 

If I enter a long string into a cell it (the string) is normally displayed in its whole, taking a part of the next cell area. Line A (1) on the picture below is an example. If I enter a long string into a cell it (the string) is truncated and a red triangle is placed into the cell to indicate this if the next cell contains any data. Line B (2) on the picture below is an example. I would like to turn off this behaviour (truncation) to acheive the effect illustrated by the line C (3) of the picture (I've produced it with a graphics editor now). Is this possible? If yes, how? 

It is not a secret that spontaneous stored data corruption (like a bit flip) is not a frequent but still pretty possible event in normal SDRAM (including DDR 1/2/3/4 SDRAM) operation. Servers and heavy-duty workstations use ECC mechanism built in to their SDRAM modules to address the issue guaranteeing that a data word read is always the data word written to that particular address before. But what about desktop/laptop PCs and hand-held gadgets using non-ECC RAM modules? How can a developer be sure that a variable contains exactly the value written to it? 

Every time I use CCleaner to clean my system, regardless to what settings I set up (as far as I could find), it purges my Start Menu most used applications list (the main (lefrmost) column of the Start Menu). Is it possible to disable this behaviour? I only want it to delete temporary files. 

I've got a time series data table with one function (row) value available for every month and the second for every 3rd month (every quarter), having holes (empty cell values) for every 2nd and 1st months of a quarter. When I try to make a chart, I can only draw a bar or a point chart, but I want the actual data points to be interconnected with lines visually filling the gaps. How to achieve this in LibreOffice 3.6? 

by hand every time I boot. How to automate this? I don't want to install GRUB to MBR and make it my primary boot loader. 

It came out (I've used an RS-232 maintenance terminal connection bypassing SATA to diagnose the HDD) that the hard drive had gotten severely damaged and was failing in an avalanche. I conclude (as I had never (throughout my 12 years experience) seen CHKDISK coming unresponsive) that CHKDISK hanging can probably mean the same (low-level HDD failure) in the most cases and the wisest things to do would be to stop using CHKDSK and either grab all the data readable as quickly as possible or turn the HDD off to prevent further damage and make further data recovery easier. 

As the ISP-provided modem was generating pretty weak WiFi signal I've disabled its WiFi function, bought an Apple AirPort Extreme and connected it's WAN port to the modem. Now everything works just perfectly, but the AirPort configuration utility keeps complaining (yes, I know how to turn it off, but I am curious) about double NAT and demands me to reconfigure the modem to bridge mode. Why should I? What problems can double NAT cause? 

I have just found it myself, sharing for just a case anybody else may need it too: It's Microsoft AppLocale and it can be downloaded from here. There also is a quick introduction into installing and using it here. 

The problem seems to be the particular hardware models (Huawei EchoLife HG520i modem/router/AP and Intel Ultimate N WiFi Link 5300 NIC) incompatibility. I can conclude this as I never have the problem with any other access point but always experience it whenever try working with a modem of the same model (they are quite popular in our location) and I never have the problem with this modem as lon as I use a different WiFi NIC (a PCMCIa one based on a different chip). 

I use KiTTY (a PuTTY derivative) to access SSH servers from a Windows PC. But I can't find how to paste text from Windows clipboard into KiTTY SSH console (neither Ctrl+V, nor Ctrl+Shift+V seem to work, and there does not seem to be Copy/Paste commands in the window's context menu). Maybe you know? 

for the first moment of the year 2012. Then, willing to make LibreOffice to recognize the format (as I was looking forward to plot a diagram), I've selected the column, chosen and entered the custom time format as 

I need to change volume balance every now and then as my headphones have the right ear too silent (while still very good in all the other criteria) while the built-in speakers are Ok. Unfortunately balance adjustment is hidden so deep in Windows 7 that it annoys me a lot to go there every time (it was much better in XP). Is there an alternative way to change it? Like a handy app just for this, a console/powershell command or a scripting way? I only need to switch between two states: normal and one biased. UPDATE: Though I have accepted an answer, I am still looking for better alternatives as the app suggested is, as I have said, too unstable. 

I have been using a personal HTTP proxy to remove ads and boost caching for a while but have then noticed that my Firefox still works when the proxy application is shut down (while the browser is configured to use proxy at 127.0.0.1:8080). Looks like there is another proxy running on my PC, perhaps even malicious. How to detect it? 

Once my external has became too slow I've ran . And it has found no problems. Next time (in a day approximately) I've ran it it still found no problems in files, indices and security descriptors but went fixing bad blocks in log file after that, then doing something with a bad block file and then with bad block bit map, then hung. I've turned it off, rebooted the computer (and switched the hard drive off and back on (not too quickly)) and ran chkdsk once again. And it hung after verifying security descriptors. Then I've tried . has been working more than 20 hours and looks hung now, the output is the following: C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator>chkdsk f: /r The type of the file system is NTFS. Volume label is ntfs-exs. 

Create the folder (named as shown above) wherever on the hard drive. Create (I've created it on the desktop and removed it at the end) a shortcut to with the folder full name as the parameter like this: explorer.exe c:\Quasifolders\Network Connections.{7007acc7-3202-11d1-aad2-00805fc1270e} Change the icon and the name. Drag it into the Start menu. Delete it from the Desktop. 

I've once read somewhere that Windows can treat programs' executables and DLL files as parts of swap file rather than duplicating their content into pagefile.sys when swapping them out of physical memory. Is that true? 

I've just moved to a new accommodation where I've got a WiFi (802.11g) router (Huawei EchoLife HG520i) right in 7 meters from my desk, so the signal is excellent (as reported by software). But despite excellent signal, the connection tends to break very frequently (automatically reconnecting immediately though, but still annoying by breaking VoIP conversations and causing browser "Server not found" errors from time to time). What may the reason be and how to fix this? What link parameters I should try finetuning in the router and/or in the computer's WiFi adapter driver? I've got no problem with other WiFi networks, so I believe my laptop's WiFi adapter to be Ok. 

There are numerous proxy-related extensions for Mozilla Firefox but all of the seem too bloat for me. I don't need proxy lists management etc. All I need is a status bar button to turn proxy usage on/off (I need this frequently and don't want to use settings window (nor any menus)). Know of such one? 

Or a blogger.com blog having both RSS and Atom feeds rels. But my Firefox (7.0.1 on XUbuntu 11.10) doesn't indicate this! I have to view a page source code to see whether there is an RSS/Atom feed for it or not. Why? How to fix this? 

In a case of mine a very high (compared to the video stream) resolution graphical frame (saying "access denied" (when my IP changes)) can appear instead of a video stream, which makes VLC window to resize, getting bigger than my screen is. This annoys me. Can I set up VLC to never resize its window when I don't do it myself and resize content instead? 

(note the single quote - it is only visible when you edit a particular cell). And I am to do so for all the cells in the column. How can I automate this? UPDATE: I've already found a solution for the particular case of mine: it helps to set a column format to "time" in the CSV import dialogue. But I am still curious how could this be done in case I wouldn't have the original .csv data file to import but only the .ods file with the data already imported without the format specified at the import time. 

I always use UTF-8, but KiTTY always resets to ISO-8859-1 for new sessions, so I have to configure this every time. Can this be altered? 

I use to receive tar.gz files fromm colleagues but unpacking them with 7zip is not convenient as it unpacks a tar file from gz first while I usually seek to get the tar file contents (so I have to unpack the tar file explicitly next). I've tried adding command to Total Commander button bar but it turned that doesn't work but returns the following error (tried it in bare command prompt): 

I've found the list of CLSIDs available for this trick here. But let's go further. I hate having icons on my desktop and I've found the way to put this to the start menu top level: 

I have added a person to my Google Chrome set-up and would like to get exactly the same set of extensions as the first person has. Is there a way to clone the set-up without the "log-in to Chrome" feature and any other on-line facilities? 

and values let web applications to know my actual screen resolution while I don't always want them to know it. Can I set my own values for these properties? I am interested in solutions for both Firefox and Chrome. 

but the quality of the result is dreadful (clearly visible visual distortions are introduced) and the playback is not smooth (too slow at some moments). I have also tried 

I only need a couple of bookmark buttons (and would prefer small favicon-only buttons without text) and don't want to add a whole long bookmark bar. Is there a way to add a button to the main toolbar itself? 

I need to update AdBlock lists every day. Is there a way to configure this to be done automatically instead of going to the AdBlock Options page and pressing "update now" by hand every time? 

Whenever I start typing a sentence in a LibreOfice Calc cell it suggests autocomplete options based on other cells contents. I usually would like to accept it and make a slight modification but when I press Enter to accept it exits the cell and I have to use mouse to start editing it again. Can I accept an autocomplete suggestion without finalizing editing?
