One nice solution would be to use TDA7297 stereo amplifier IC (2x15 watt stereo), and build a custom PCB: 

I used the method described here and here , which is a python script based on interrupts, to enable safe shutdown via push-button press. These are the steps in short: 1- 

I want to auto login to the terminal after boot (Jessie). I tried the instructions here ($URL$ but it didn't work. I think the problem is the new systemd init structure in Jessie. So, is there any method to auto login to the terminal in Jessie !? 

I want to monitor a log file (omxd log file) in real time, and execute some commands when some sentences appear in the log. I searched this site (and many other sites) and these are what I tried: 

This method worked fine. When a usb flash memory was plugged, it automatically started to run the file. However, after upgrading to Jessie, it doesn't work. When plugging a usb flash memory, it gives the following errors: 

I installed $URL$ which is a playlist daemon for . It works great! It is very helpful, and I recommend it to all users. 

I'm trying to install Urho3D on RPi 3. (GPU = 768 MB) I installed all the essential dependencies. All the steps went fine. Until this error which occurred during the final make step: 

I'm using a CAT6 cable to connect my RPi 2 to D-Link ADSL Modem. But I can't! Here are what I've already tested: When the system is up, I run: 

Has anyone tried out these solutions before? Which one is more reliable, has the least delay between videos, with maximum synchrony? Is there any other solution besides these ones? 

I use RPi B+ for playing a folder of videos automatically after boot. But the problem is that during the initial boot, the red LED on the board blinks 2 times (one after 4-5 seconds of boot, and the other after 5-6 seconds.) I searched a lot on the net, and I'm pretty sure that the red LED on the board is related to power only. First, I was using a cheap usb mobile charger; the red LED used to blink very often, both at boot, and later on operation time. So I changed the PSU, and bought a reliable 5 V / 5 A power adapter!! The number of the blinks of the red LED decreased. It was good. But still I would get blinks on the beginning of each video. So I changed the power cables to thicker ones, because they can provide enough current. Fortunately, the blinks on the beginning of each video disappeared, and it got solved. However, still I get those 2 red LED blinks at the initial boot. What would be the cause !!? 

I've installed xbian on RPi. I want to edit the files in my SD card using my computer, Ubuntu 14.04. However, when I insert the SD card, the Ubuntu cannot mount the Xbian partition, and gives the following error: 

Currently I'm using omxplayer on Raspbian to automatically play a folder of videos in loop after boot. It works great. The only problem is that it takes almost 90 seconds to boot and start to play video files. I switched to Xbian ; it was better. But still it would take almost 50 seconds to boot and play video files. So I decided to find very minimal distros with fast boot process. I searched a lot, and found Minibian ($URL$ and Moebius ($URL$ which both are probably the minimized versions of Raspbian. These distros claim to have very fast boot processes (20 and 10 seconds), which make them ideal for minimal embedded applications. This is great. However, it seems that people have had problems installing omxplayer on these distros. Would you please help what we shall change, or what dependencies we shall install first, so as to be able to install omxplayer on very minimal distros, like Minibian or Moebius !? By the way, do you suggest any other light and minimal distro to use? Thank you for your time and support. 

OS: Raspbian Jessie How can I change the color of all the logs and text during the initial boot (and also the final shutdown) to black? (including the login user/password prompt) !? My goal is to have a completely silent boot, where no text is shown. 

I just recently installed Urho3D game engine on Raspberry Pi 3. But the problem is that when I run each of the example games, the game opens and I see the scene, but the keyboard keys (or even the mouse clicks) don't work, and I'm not able to move or do anything. All I can do is Ctrl+C to quit (which sometimes doesn't work either!!). How can I solve this !!? 

First, I do not see any mention of the red light. Second, no mention of voltage readings at the 5V and 3.3V pins. At the very least we would need that much information in order to know whether the internal voltage regulator itself burned out. 

I have a Pi 3B set up as a workstation. Naturally I want xscreensaver to kick in at some point then lock it some time later. That all works fine. However, I also use xrdp with Windows Remote Desktop to monitor a live gnuplot graph from a PC at the same time. (I purposely avoided using vnc which could attach to the console) With xrdp I believe it creates an entirely separate virtual console. The problem is that the screensaver is activating during the RDP session. (Both are logged in as user pi) So far I have tried disabling it in the RDP session and found that it also disabled it on the console. Question is in the title: Can I stop console xscreensaver from affecting remote connections? 

Please allow me to suggest you use I2C for this. Use the Wire.h library on the Arduino and A4 for SDA and A5 for SCL. Plus GND. When you invoke the Wire.begin(x); command be sure to give your Arduino a unique address, x, such as 0x20. Raspi-config can enable I2C on the Pi, and you can use GPIO pins 3 and 5 for SDA and SCL. Here is a basic tutorial: $URL$ Once you apt-get install i2c-tools you can use i2cdetect -y 1 to see the Arduino's address when it is ready. Another major advantage to using I2C is that it is easy to add a real-time clock (DS3231) or other I2C-enabled devices including more Arduinos.. More to the point of your question, here is more info on the Pi's pins if you want to connect to them directly: $URL$ Cheers. 

If the file is in the current directory, then it is not necessary to use a fully-qualified path to the attachment. And if used in cron remember that the jobs always run in the user's home directory, so it is good practice to use a full directory path to the attachment file. Voila. That's it. Couldn't be easier. It works both on Raspbian and all the later versions of Ubuntu. 

(Shown here with header pins soldered in place directly above the screw hole) Don't use too much heat or solder. A little bit will do. It is delicate underneath, with a thin trace. I leave them just open, and use the green wire to briefly short them together. Alternatively, connect to a momentary-on (NO) pushbutton. For my data-loggers and such there never is a need to hard-reset like this. A simple 

The question is in the title. Should we all rush out and do that to our stable systems, even before there is a Stretch NOOBS? Have enough people done this to consider it safe? 

Every time I use leafpad it all seems to work just fine, but on the console it leaves behind the error message: 

Filezilla is the simplest way to do it. You can install it on one Pi and use it to see the directories on both, for transferring. It is easily installed: 

It will prompt you for a remote-access password, then ask you to confirm it. At that point you can use any VNC client to access the regular desktop. But there is a better way: To go a step further, install Remote Desktop Protocol. 

The first step I would take is a reading at the 5V pin. Make sure the power is actually making it through. Then I would test the 3.3V pin. 

If the red LED never comes on, then maybe it has failed in some way. Like in jetliners where the landing gear light fails so everybody panics until the Air Force looks and can see the gear is actually down. I agree that starting with a good fresh NOOBs SD card would be a good way to see if the green light acts differently. If it does not then in addition to possible damage to the red LED there might possibly be damage to the SD card socket. Since the hardware is cheap and available you may want to borrow a friend's for a test or buy a new one. And finally, make very sure you have a power supply intended for the thing. Improper power can lead to all sorts of strange indications. Again, they are cheap and available, so either borrow a known good one or just buy another yourself. Good luck. 

Lots of issues in one post. I don't see any particular question in there. But I wonder if you have a friend who has a Rpi where you can test SD cards so you at least know the software works? The basic answer is to start over with NOOBs. If it doesn't work on a particular SD card then try another. I highly recommend nothing larger than 16 GB nor smaller than 4. In the OP you do not mention what kind of screen. I can only presume HDMI. In which case I start at the basics. 1) is it plugged in? 2) is it turned on? etcetera. Probably the most diagnotic part of your post is that the red LED is on. That is good; means you have power that is acceptable to the Rpi. And that the green LED is not on, which always means the software (bootloader, etc.) is not trying to read the SD card. So, based on this little bit of information in the OP, I recommend you start over with a 16 GB micro SD card and format it as FAT, then download a fresh copy of NOOBs and get it over to the SD card. Then boot that. Feel free to report back here the results. We'd like to know the condition of LEDs and the HDMI display. Cheers 

This is included in many Linux distros, and can be installed easily otherwise. For other systems, it is possible to run it off of a DVD or USB stick, so it can be used there as well. The Linux part also means it supports the SD card format if it is , so it can be reformatted easily and efficiently, and less problems are likely to occur. Most disk utils, particuarly on Windows, will likely destroy any boot data on the SD card and muck it up in other ways. Here a screenshot of GParted showing the contents of an SD card with Raspbian on: Note: The boot partition will likely have a label or flag 'boot' To carry out operations on a partition of an, right click on it, and select 'Unmount'. If a partition is mounted (shown by a set of keys next to the partition name), no operations can be done on it. Once it is unmounted, you can check it for errors, reformat it, rename it, delete and create a new one, etc. Documentation on using GParted can be found here 

A tutorial of interest can be found here, with how you can set-up the display etc, and also if you run: 

This can be connected to by an Android device, using ConnectBot. This is rather good, but you cannot always use characters such as or , as there is a severe lack of things like arrow keys, as it uses the default keyboard. This can be improved by using Hacker's Keyboard, which you can install (also for free) as well, and may be one of the better android apps. If you have connection issues, this can sometimes be resolved by running this on the Pi - - to remove the default compression settings. (If this results in the sort of error, run to create the directory first) 

What the dongles' power consumption should be? The USB 2 spec (which OTG partly falls back on - also not all devices conform to either) says that up to 500mA should be available at around 5V through a USB port. As the the USB devices expect to be able to get at most 500mA each, this may equate to trying to get 1A through a 500mA USB port - this might not be a good idea. Another limit in place when trying to power through any Pi is the power input - on most Pi's this is limited by a 2A polyfuse[Note]. So with the Pi Zero needing say 400mA, and the USB devices wanting at most 500mA you may be fine, it may reboot a lot, or it may melt/break somewhere. Note: I don't know whether Pi Zero has one, perhaps the only current limit in place on it is whether it melts or not (see here) So long story short, a powered USB hub (that doesn't back power) would work best - this also can be used to power the Pi as well, which will keep the wires to a minimum (you don't necessarily have to power the Pi separately). There is a list of ones that should work here. What output the power supply should have in order to handle both dongles? A power supply that can output 1.5A or more (7.5W) should work (for the Pi and 2 USBs at a near full power) - I think it is recommended to use a 2A supply on nearly all Pis though. 

The image is probably at (windows path), if anywhere. I think you have mixed up the s and s - probably in this step: 

If you want better quality you can use a variety of USB Sound Cards, or addon boards like the HiFiBerry. 

Source The board connects to the GPIO P1 header on the P1 (the big one in the corner), which has the following Pins: 

A (now) somewhat obvious answer is to get the Raspberry Zero W (Wireless), which on currently seems to retail for about £5 more than a normal Zero (£9 to £10 currently on most UK retailers - w/o header pins and other accessories) This has various benefits over other solutions, including: 

After being left for at most half a day after the incident, it still works... My questions are: A) Have I voided the warranty? I can't find anything on this... if so I might as well solder on a reset P6 header... B) Having scraped through this, what impact would this have on my Pi? The GPIOs, the Graphics, the USB ports all seem to work. Looking at where it has melted through the writing on top of the packaged processor and RAM (this Pi is a model B), would it just be the RAM that is affected? Would this significantly affect the Pi's lifespan? C) Will it better to leave it, or start using it again? I am trying to get the 'robot' (box on four wheels) ready for going away for Christmas, but I don't want to cause any more damage. I did a quick two minute test on it, and it seems fine, but I don't want to make anything worse...
