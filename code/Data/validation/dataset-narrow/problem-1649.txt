I have a Raspberry Pi 3 with built-in wifi card. When I do run I can find the wlan0 device. Before I never had a wifi problem until I connected the Raspberry Pi to my TV through the HDMI port. On my laptop, I can see that the access point is detected and working fine. The Raspberry Pi however is showing: No wireless interfaces found. 

The Problem is that the program is stuck Waiting for a song to play even if I play a song with VLC, JUK or Browser. What am I doing wrong? 

Basically, I have 10 LEDs in a row connected to my Raspberry Pi. Each LED has its own GPIO pin. Then, I play a song with my Raspberry Pi. Since yesterday, I was trying to find a way to visualize the volume of a beat of the song with LEDs. Put simplier, if the beat volume is at 100 percent, 10 LEDs should light. If the current beat volume is at 60 percent, the first 6 LEDs should light, and if the beat volume is at 10 percent, only the first LED should light. So far I am able to play the song, but I am trying to find a variable to will help me to calculate the beat volume in real time (while playing the music) My question is how to find that variable that will allow me to calculate the beat volume in real time. I used the library so far. Here is my code: 

You may add more devices to the network, you just must assign the device a new different static IP address. The default operating frequency/channel (2.412 GHz: channel 1) is frequently congested. Try using a different channel in the event of difficulties. Change to a different number Use to find other channels. src: $URL$ 

Now what is the Pi's IP address? Search for the MAC address, all RPi 3 have the same start to their MAC address. (Won't work on enterprise network, ask admin about privliages) : 

Some tutorials I found are outdated, but the following answer contains a collection of notes I have used to set up home, school(enterprise), & Ad-Hoc wireless connections on my Raspberry Pi 3. 

I have 8 RGB LEDs in a Row. Each RGB LED has 3 GPIO pin to control the color Red Green and Blue. I used all available GPIO pins. I works for the 7 RGB LEDs. One LEDs does not light properly for 2 colors. I check the GPIO Pin and it's the 9th and the 10th. It's written MOSI and MISO as well. I don't know if that's related to the problem. 

I have two raspberry Pi 3 with built in wifi card. I run a program that required internet on one of them the whole night last night. The next day, I say the red temperature gauge indicating an overheat and the program was disconnected from the internet. I stopped the pi immediately and let it cool for two hours. Then when I rebooted, the wifi card was not detected anymore, even when I run the -a cmd. wlan0 just disappeared. In addition, the temperature started to increase very fast from 50 to 70 although I don't run any program on the pi. To check if it was a software problem, I swapped the SD card of my pi to the other Raspberry pi that was healthy. The healthy pi detected its wifi card without any problem with no heat jump. Is it a hardware fail? If so, is it possible remove the wifi card if it causes the fast increase in temperature so that I can at least use my pi with an external wifi usb dongle? Also, how can I prevent that problem next time? How to tell the pi to turn off immediately when it reaches a certain temperature? Thanks 

Yes, the keypad you linked to would work because it treats each individual button as a separate switch. This tutorial describes how to connect switches to raspberry pi GPIO pins. The keypad won't need any additional hardware because the GPIO pins (some of them, at least—I'm not sure if they all do) have pull-up resistors. 

You need to set up a DHCP reservation on your router. DHCP is the protocol used by routers to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices on the network. You can tell the router the MAC address of your Raspberry Pi and the IP address you want it to have, and it will always reserve this address for the Pi, even if it's disconnected for a time. This doesn't require any configuration on the Pi's end. Routers have all kinds of different interfaces, but I am pretty confident that this is a feature all will have. I can't give a guide for all routers, but here is a tutorial that might help, and Googling around with the name/model of your router will probably turn up more specific results. As far as I know, you can use just about any IP address in the private network range. I would go for anything with 192.168.1.X where X is from 2 to 255. 192.168.1.1 is usually reserved for the router itself. If you want more info see the Wikipedia article about Reserved IP addresses. 

Ad-Hoc Network / Access Point / Bridge Connection You want to wireless connect to the pi but there are no available wireless networks. Create your own! The Raspberry Pi can be set up to broadcast a wireless network. This network allows you to connect the the pi, but will not connect to the internet.

Raspberry Pi 3 (kernel 4.14.30-v7+) This post is a collection of notes and tutorials I have used for setting up wireless connections to the Raspberry Pi. Please let me know if you experience any issues. 

Enterprise Network Connection This is how I connect to my university wifi First create password hash and save to file (keep the single quotes around your password): 

Most TVs have various scanning modes, which is part of the reason overscan is necessary. If you can find an option called "format" or "scanning mode" or anything like that, select the "PC" or "Just scan" mode. In this mode, the TV will display its input pixel for pixel. It seems that not all TVs have this mode, sadly, and there's no way around it, but most should. 

What you are asking for is a port expander, like joan said. If you want a lower-level or cheaper solution, you could control 12 devices with 4 wires using Charlieplexing, but that is more complicated. Like joan said, GPIOs are plentiful on the rPi, but if you are hoping for a low-wire count solution to have your sensors far away from the rPi, you will almost certainly need at least 3 or 4 wires, either Charlieplexing or i2c with power and ground. If you have a long i2c line, be careful to have a sufficient pull-up resistor. Good luck! 

Run this on Pi, Then I connected from to the second IP address listed via ssh pi@[ipaddr] from my Ubuntu host machine. With ethernet bridge (I have not tested this, but from the same tinkerers as ↑) $URL$ 

Check your micro USB cords y'all! Not all usb cords transfer data. Now the Pi is able to find the device. 

Less Simple More complicated but will connect to known networks and create ad-hoc if none are found. Follow this tutorial (no ethernet bridge, I have used this successfully) $URL$ 

I followed these calibration instructions from the manufacturer. I have attempted to calibrate from the command line 

Managing Multiple Connections Add priority flags to each network in wpa_supplicant.conf default priority=0 (greatest priority goes first) My prioritized wpa_supplicant.conf: 

First off, while this chip looks to be good (and I really like those yellow headers), it can't help you with inputs and outputs at the same time. I don't think you had that question, but I wanted to answer it in case you did. For level-converting digital inputs without extra hardware, you can rig up a voltage divider for the inputs to reduce the 5 V to 3.3 V. 18 K and 10 K should be a good ratio, with the 10 K resistor between the 5 V signal and the 3.3 V input and the 18 K resistor between the input and ground. I haven't tested these values with a raspberry pi, but it works on paper. Feel free to google around to see what others use, and definitely test your circuit with a multimeter before connecting it to the raspberry pi. That combo I gave you will produce up to 3.2 V, but if you want to play it safe, reduce the 18 K resistor to 15 K, 12 K or even 10 K. The raspberry pi detects logic high for anything above 2.0 V. If you need bi-directional communication like I2C, it will be hard to level-shift without more hardware. Now, for analog signals (I think this is your real question), there is a guide that describes a rather clever method for measuring analog signals between 0 V and 3.3 V using only the raspberry pi and a comparator like the LM311, which are pretty common. The idea is to generate an analog voltage with the raspberry pi using PWM and comparing that voltage to the input until a nearly accurate value is found. Here is the link: $URL$ Remember that you might have to use a resistor network like the one I described to adjust the levels of the analog signals to safe values. The guide looks very thorough and there are schematics and code provided, but I don't know whether it is designed for multiple inputs. Good luck! Update: I missed the link to your kit. To answer your question more directly, no. It doesn't look like anything in that kit is equipped to read in analog signals. Those boards all appear to have a lot of digital I/O but nothing analog. 

And attemping to calibrate from the gui(menu->preferences->calibrate touchscreen), I receive the same error. What is going on here? The display variable exists and the screen otherwise works. Waveshare 5inch HDMI LCD (B) Raspberry Pi 3 kernel 4.14.27-v7+ 

SSH must be enabled by placing a file named 'ssh', without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card. This will allow you to connect from an external device. Network connections must be defined 

Headless set-up Raspbian currently looks in the boot partition for a couple files to allow a headless set-up or connect a Raspberry Pi to a network and establish an ssh connection from an external machine without a monitor, screen or mouse. After you load Raspbian OS onto an micro SD card, :
