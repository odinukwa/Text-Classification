The logic seems to be if there is not contention I will get the data at line rate (32ms) 150 users woudl consume 150*40000*8 = 49,152,000 which is 50 % of 10 meg. If the link is contended and hence policed to 50 meg it will take twice as long as only 50% of the BW is usable 

I will assume you are running IBGP, you never send a prefix you received via IBGP to an IBGP neighbor, also there would be split horizon (don't send a route back to the person who sent it to you). Since this box only has one neighbor and it is not originating any routes by itself, it will not send any routes, so the policy is implicit, but there. 

I cannot speak for anyone else but I do a TOR 8 to 16 port 'terminal server' that is connected to a management Ethernet, we do not try to use the structured cable to bring them to a central set of terminal servers. We then test as part of the turn up. We also home run the cables, as it is less likely that someone will disconnect one in error and you don't know that the cabling is wrong till you really need it. Unless you have on site people you really trust, I would not try to save $$s on this. 

If you have the conflict resolution configuration in place, the device will chack if the IP address is already assigned to another client or not. Also, If the clients are already assigned an IP and the DHCP for some reason stops, the client will continue to communicate normally before the renew period expires. So in case you reconfiguration affects the DHCP, you clients that already have an IP will not be affected. The new ones will get the IP from the new pool after the conflict test is passed. However, if your setup is critical, I strongly advise you to do a test of this scenarion on a spare router before implementing it on a live system. Also try to find a low traffic period for your change. 

LAN1 (source:192.168.2.100, destination:192.168.202.100) -------> LAN1 Gateway Router which will do NATing and VPN. (change source:192.168.102.100,destination:192.168.202.100) ---------------> LAN2 Gateway Router which will terminate VPN and do NATing (source:192.168.102.100,change destination:192.168.2.100) ------------------------------------------------------> Packet reaches LAN2. 

FETs are not required to connect 2Ks, they are far cheaper than SFPs and for some odd reason (to me) you can only order them when you order 2ks. As Ricky said you are going to see a non standard Ethernet encapsulation but that is a matter of does wireshark support it. Cisco will be happy to take the extra $$s for SFP+ 

Most products require you to configure MAC addresses in DHCP for imaging to, so a normal PC will not use DHCP addresses from the imaging server, this begs the question why have a PXE VLAN? I use one for servers but all production networks are tagged so we can rebuild the server without needing to change the switch, but I would suggest this setup is needlessly complex. Use 2 DHCP servers 1 to build and one for normal operations and have a small scope in the build DHCP server. 

Each VLAN creates its own broadcast domain in 1 or more physical switches. If you have a switch taken out of the box it tends to put all ports in vlan 1 so for say a 24 ports the broadcast domain includes all 24 ports. If you were to create a vlan 2 and configure half the ports to be members of vlan 2 you then have 2 broadcast domains each of 12 ports. if you create a vlan 3 and put half the ports that are still in vlan 1 in it you would end of with 3 broadcast domains 2 with 6 ports and 1 with 12. 

The selection criteria between the two choices needs to be refined further in your question. If all you care about the throughput on the switch and ignore all other things, you can go with the device that provides more throughput. 4500 switch is a layer 3 switch used for access or distribution (even core for small networks) with huge capabilities and flexibility. It is a modular switch meaning that you add modules based on your needs. For sure it will be more expensive and might be an over kill for your needs if all you need is to add a few servers to your network. Buying the 2960S stackable switch on the other hand will be cheaper as it is a layer 2 switch used only for access layer. You can always always buy more switches add stack them together if you need to add more servers. Please keep in mind that your server performance is not only governed by the access layer switch you will buying. It will depend on the complete path your user data traverses before reaching your servers. 

ASIC can be thought of as a kind of chip. It is normally built in order to do something in hardware that otherwise would be done is software. So Cisco can build an ASIC for anything it wants. Depending on the model of the switch there is 1 or many ASICs. TCAM is a memory design since it is usually found on the chassis systems it is implemented as 1 of many asics. TCAM is used for particular lookup functions like routing (CEF) or ACLS, so if an ASIC does not need to do that kind of lookup it works separately from TCAM. On the other hand ASICs that handle QoS marking work hand in glove with TCAM. The presentation below on cisco live discusses some of the design tradeoffs, and a good place to look to get an understanding of what goes into switch design BRKARC-3466 - Exploring the engineering behind the making of a switch (2013 Orlando) it contains lists of the asics and a lot of general switch design information 

You will need double NATing to achieve this without changing IP addresses. You can not ping an IP that is in your LAN and expect it to reach somewhere else. As long as you are part of a LAN and communicate locally, your traffic to IP address in 192.168.2.0/24 will always go to your local network. As mentioned above, you will need two IP ranges lets say 192.168.102.0/24 and 192.168.202 that will be used for double NATing like this: 

LAN2 (source:192.168.2.100, destination:192.168.102.100) ------> LAN2 Gateway Router which will do NATing and VPN. (change source:192.168.202.100,destination:192.168.102.100) --------------> LAN1 Gateway Router which will terminate VPN and do NATing (source:192.168.202.100,change destination:192.168.2.100) -----------------------------------------------------> Packet reaches LAN1. 

As you can see, LAN1 appears to LAN2 as 192.168.102.0/24 and LAN2 appears to LAN1 as 192.168.202.0/24. 

There is an option to resolve IP conflicts between clients on Cisco IOS. It needs to be configured carefully. from this source: 

ARP tables are populated when the machine sends any traffic to the network (DHCP or any other). The switch receives the packets generated by the machine and grabs the mac address of the machine and puts in ARP table with the information of the port it came from. So, if you can't see the ARP entry of the laptop, it means that the laptop did not exchange any packets with switch. A note, there are two commands for arp: and .
