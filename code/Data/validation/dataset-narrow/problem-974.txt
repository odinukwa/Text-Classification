You have a couple options available. In my opinion, the best solution would be to utilize a WISP router. A WISP router will connect to the ISP through your family's router and additionally, will rebroadcast the signal so your other devices can access it. The only time you would then need a repeater is if the signal from the WISP is weak in certain areas of your place. I don't know your technical expertise, but you can create a homebrew WISP. WRT54G can easily be sourced for cheap, which when set into client mode can be used as a WISP. You can also buy dedicated WISP routers. 

This is a relatively common occurrence when installing to a USB drive, it is caused by xorg.conf being corrupted, or changed. So restoring the failsafe should solve your problem. First, make a backup of it to be safe:

I had the opposite experience, as a Dutch ex-pat living in the US. I wanted to retain some of my Dutch and thought by installing the Dutch language pack this would help. But I too have Windows 7 64-bit Professional. The solution I followed is outlined in this thread, although be aware that it violates the EULA and the best (unless someone knows a better and legal solution) option is to purchase an English language OEM copy. 

You don't mention which version of the software you are using, but for recent versions the following is generic advice that will work: In photoshop, go to the Help menu, then click deactivate. That tells Adobe you're no longer using this computer. Then uninstall correctly through the product uninstaller, typically found on the start menu. When you install on your other computer, the product registration will reactivate your license. In MS Office, you can just uninstall using the uninstaller and the product takes care of the deactivation itself. ~$URL$ 

The best way I know that non-technical folk can get as anonymous as possible is to use the free TOR Project, which uses a series of volunteer proxies to route traffic so as to mask its origin. You can get the TOR Project as a plugin to Firefox and use Firefox in Private Browsing mode to avoid leaving traces on the host computer and you can go even further and use a sandboxed browser, either through running your browser through Sandboxie or in a Virtual Machine, or you can get dedicated sandboxed browsers such as KACE that when run alongside TOR will give you a good chance of staying as anonymous as possible. It is very hard to remain completely anonymous. Below are the links to all these goodies! :) 

If the password is displayed but masked with on the router's configuration page, typically $URL$ for your router, you can install the Web Developer toolbar in firefox or chrome and use the option to display the password in plain text. If that doesn't work, then here are 4 more options to recover your ADSL password, as long as you're on a Windows machine. If you're on Linux or Unix, try this instead. 

From the command prompt, type . This will provide a list of options available. If you then want to know the specific options for each, type or , where is one of the options from the original list. A full list of them is also available online, but I can't vouch for accuracy. (although at a glance it seems sound.) 

You're going to want to run through the setup for the PHP Plugin again, to make sure you configured everything correctly. I use an external WAMP server, as I can better mirror the environment I am developing for. They have a guide on how to set that up, too. 

As sirex says, Lastpass is brilliant. You won't need to even go through the hassle of connecting your cellphone, as it stores your usernames and passwords after a one-time correct login, or you can import accounts from other password managers, it then auto-fills your details on subsequent visits so you only have to click the login button. If you then are concerned that this would only be for one computer, or you don't want to go through the hassle of downloading lastpass for each computer you work at, try using firefox portable in dropbox for on-the-road password bliss. You will need: 

If you are certain you no longer need what is in it, you can use the free program "unlocker". $URL$ There is an x64 version that will work for you. 

I don't know of a way to do it without VBA, but the following is taken from The Scripting Guy blog on TechNet. You should refer to the blog post on how to use it, but it is the best way that I currently know of. 

Yes, there is a major performance difference. The 580M is compared in reviews to the 560 or 560ti. The following link is a reputable source with an objective overview of the 580M. At the bottom of the page you will find benchmark results you can directly compare with results from the 580. $URL$ 

I'd download VMWare Player, or VirtualBox, both of which are free, and then go to each of the distro's websites and grab their VM iso dowload and try it out. Nothing to lose doing it that way, as you'll soon see which you prefer. If they don't offer a VMX version for VMWare, you can simply use easyVMX to roll your own from their regular downloads. Ubuntu is always a good starting place, as it is designed to be user-friendly towards new linux users. There are also flavors of Ubuntu with different GUI's, such as Kubuntu and Xubuntu. But remember, underneath all the fluff, most Linux flavors are all the same and so your skills will transfer. What do you develop? If you're doing web development and just need a LAMP stack, most Linux distros are simple to get up and running. As a Linux novice, I'd have you go with Ubuntu again, solely because of the amount of documentation and tutorials out there for you to learn from. 

I run two U2713H, which is I believe the same base monitor, just a few inches larger--so this should work for you too. I use a free program called f.lux to fine-tune the kelvin. It is really designed to protect against eye strain of the extremely bright settings that most monitors come with out-of-the-box (and uninformed users tend to stick with). So by default the program finds your location and sets the color temperature to rise and fall as the sun does in your region. But yu can manipulate it however you want by selecting the color temperature for it to stay at permanently. I do something in-between. I have it set permanently to what I find comfortable during the day to avoid eye strain, and then have an adjustment for evenings that is not too far off. If I am doing color sensitive design, it has a function to turn off for an hour without having to close the program down. I also use a Datacolor Spyder 4 Pro to maintain the same color calibration. It's worth the money if you're doing color sensitive work professionally. 

There are also some major considerations, such as the internet connection speed of your audience, the types of devices the target audience will be watching on, and of course, your budget. Assuming the worst case scenario, no budget at all, you are limited to free services such as Livestream, Justin.tv, YouTube, and Vimeo. There are some cons to each service, but for free they really are very good. Some of thee cons are streaming at non-HD resolution; the displaying of advertisements before, during, or after your broadcast; no video analytics; and/or, no video archiving after the live event has finished. So you will have to research what best suits your needs. Livestream.com does not have ads, does not have archiving, but it does have easy-to-use software and service. So it would be my choice to stream for free. You can only stream SD quality with a free account, but here is a very simple solution that will get you streaming in no time: 

This happens to a lot of my portable hard drives too. I regularly have to switch between Linux, mac and various flavors of Windows and can't always keep one hard drive for each type. But I've used them with this behavior ongoing for a couple of years now. The data is still fine, I don't why it does it, but I'd say keep a backup and don't worry too much about it. I've run the windows drive error check and it fixes it for a short while before coming back. So if someone else comes along with a way to fix this behavior, then great, I'll have a fix too, but otherwise I wouldn't sweat it. :) Edit: I did just find a way to fix missing or corrupt partitions on your drive: - Follow the instructions from here 

Quite honestly, whether you trust your software or not, the very first thing to do is to create a complete backup of your drive before you try any repairs whatsoever. Also ask yourself if you have noticed any problems with your HDD. Funny noises, slowdowns, glitches, etc. These are all indications of a failing drive, but sometimes a HDD will just fail outright with no warning. The key is to regularly backup, preferably with a bit-by-bit solution such as Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image. But if you don't care about imaging your drive, then just backing up your important files to an external drive will also work. Once you have a complete backup, you can try running some other HDD diagnostic tools, such as: 

I think the bottom line here is that if you have enough space, then it won't do any harm to load up the SSD with your Apps. If you don't have that much space, then I suggest only putting Apps on the SSD that will benefit from being there due to their need for fast access speeds, such as games or multimedia editors. 

I believe this should work if you uncheck SSL for inbound and outbound mail. Tools -> Accounts -> Mail -> Properties -> Advanced -> uncheck SSL Also, this article might help you find other places SSL/TLS gets enabled in Avast. 

You're correct. The corsair blog has a good post on this topic with the following image being a part of that post. The H100 will work in the same fashion. I use a H60 with push-pull to aid the radiator in dispersing the heat. Youtube also has a bunch of videos showing the H100 in push-pull configuration. 

It runs on a CD-ROM, or a DVD, or a Flash drive and only stores information in RAM, It will not save anything to a hard drive, even if swap space is available. This means that ultimately, your data can't be traced to the computer you are on. Rather than quote the rest of their about page, go take a read and see if its of any use to you. It is important to note all of the above answers information, and if you're uploading images, you should also purge their metadata before saving them online. That's one further step towards anonymity. Of course, if you're hosting the blog on hosting you've paid for, then you must anonymize yourself there too. Pay for WHOIS privacy, or use a third-party domain management service. Set your web server to disable log creation. This can be a pain for those wanting to troubleshoot issues, but it is another avenue of retracing those who connected from what IP address at what time ... so turn them off. 

You can create a system image using a third party software such as Acronis True Image, Norton Ghost or a free software such as Easeus Disk Copy and image the new drive. There is also the built-in Backup/Restore functions which essentially does the same thing. Microsoft provides the following guides to system images: $URL$ $URL$ The following tutorial is very simple to follow through the entire process of backing up and restoring: $URL$ 

C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Temp Also reachable through WIN+R, then typing %appdata% and then following Local -> Temp. 

I have recently gone through something similar, and so have done a lot of research on what is out there. There are a few things you will need: 

Your username in Windows is just for Windows. Nearly all software will allow you to customize. Some prominent software, such as Microsoft Office products, pull your Windows username into the software by default; however, they offer a simple way to change that within the software option menu. So the bottom line is that you shouldn't worry, choose whatever you want it to be. 

As you are developing a website locally, simply include the jQuery library and a jQuery script with the following code: 

My opinion is not specific in your case, as your workstation is actually very nice—I use one at the office too. The other answers already give my main opinion, which is that I believe they do it to avoid wasting their Customer Service Support's time and therefore their profit margin. But I also believe certain manufacturers disable features to try and get you to purchase the more expensive computer, maybe under the Professional line, or the Extreme line, which may have features unlocked that appeal to the crowd they're selling it to in the same way the actual CPU and Motherboard manufacturers do. 

Putting the Apps on your SSD will decrease the available space on your SSD and as SSDs are currently still very expensive per GB, this might therefore be a reason not to do this. Trillian doesn't need a fast running hard drive to work well, so doesn't benefit from being on the SSD, plus the AV and spyware can be set to run "out of hours" from your storage drive.
