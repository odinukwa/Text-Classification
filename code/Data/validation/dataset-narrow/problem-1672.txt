So, we would only need 48 Watts to supply all four ports with 2.4 Amps simultaneously. The Anker is capable of 60 Watts, so it has power to spare. RESULT: You should be just fine with this power supply. Good luck, and have a fun time with your Pis!!! 

The quick answer: No, you cannot run it on the Pi at this time (same goes for the other games you mentioned). The full answer: Stickman is a Windows GUI application. It requires the full Windows OS to run properly. Unfortunately, as of this time (Dec 2017) there is not a full version of Windows that runs on the Pi, or any other ARM-processor device. There is a lightweight IoT version of Windows that runs on the Pi, but it is not intended for running full-fledged traditional Windows applications and/or games. Good luck! 

I would recommend trying either DietPi or TinyCoreLinux to start with. They offer different experiences based on what you're trying to do. Good Luck! 

Here's another question/answer similar to this one that seems to fix an issue like yours. Maybe that fits your situation? If so, please let us know. Thanks, and good luck! 

For your first question about amperage, here's a layman's attempt at an answer: In this case, the 2.5A rating of the Pi is a measure of the maximum amount of electricity it wants made available to it from the power supply. Each individual Pi you plug into a port on the Anker should be fine because it has a rating of 2.4 Amps-per-port, which is "close enough". Now on to the second question: What is the "second" rating (in your case "4.4A") about? It's the total amount of electricity the entire device is capable of giving out all at the same time. So a 4-port, 2.4A power supply could potentially be called upon to give out 9.6A if all four ports are drawing their maximum simultaneously. But, if it's rated only at 4.4A, then you won't be able to plug in multiple Pis simultaneously because they will be starved of electricity. However you could plug in a few phones to charge them at a slow pace, etc. Now to answer the BIG question: Will it work? How do we know then if the power supply you chose will support all four ports at 2.4A simultaneously? We need to know it's power rating. In this case, the specs say it is a "60 Watt" supply. All USB ports are 5 volt devices, so now for a little basic math: 

If you don't own the page being displayed, you can wrap it in an invisible IFrame that refreshes it's contents every so often. Here's some code for that IFrame I found somewhere on the net (not my code! - If I could attribute it I would)... 

You now have an LED that is short-hardened with two wires coming off the bottom. A nice neat package. 

If you need a newer version (10.1, etc.) then you may have to compile from the source. Painful, but doable... Good luck! 

There are too many variables that effect how much power a device draws to try and answer this for you directly. So, I will try to give you a process: 

I'm seeing mixed messages about running PyCharm directly on the Raspberry Pi, but there's an existing thread on StackOverflow that seems to mention you can run it there (see below). One thing is certain: Jetbrains does provide a way of doing remote development between a PyCharm installation on a Laptop/Desktop and a remote Pi, but that's not what you seem to be asking. Here's that link, please report back if you are successful or not: $URL$ Good Luck! 

As of right now (11/24/2017) you can install Postgresql v9.6 (stable/armhf) directly from the default Raspbian repositories via this command in the terminal/shell: 

This is a common question that has already been answered in another thread. Essentially you need to set it up in the LXDE environment's file. Here is the link to that thread with full instructions: Execute script on start-up Good luck! 

Use whatever app you want to set/unset the GPIO output voltage high/low to switch on/off the LED. Good luck! I hope this helps! 

This is a VERY subjective measure, and you should always do real-world tests to verify. But at least it should get you in the ballpark range of what a given size of battery will get you. Good luck! 

I am dubious of the fact that there are 2 copies of showing up. This usually means that you have either configured your device to talk to 2 SSIDs, or, you have some duplication of configurations somewhere in your networking setup. Also, I noticed some settings in your section of the file that might not be needed, and could be causing issues. You might want to try removing all of the settings in that key except for your and , making it look like this: 

Most settings have sane defaults. Sometimes the extra settings can cause issues unless you specifically have needs for them. Let us know if this helps! 

Because of the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), Python is notorious for not being very friendly to multi-threaded application design. One possible solution is to use the Python MultiProcessing library instead. This library provides process-level execution to "emulate" much of the capabilities you normally get with multithreading. Might be worth trying it out! Please check back in and let us know if this helped. Good luck! 

For this situation you are going to need an adapter that converts 10.8v down to the 5v needed by the Raspberry Pi. Typically you would use what is called a Buck Converter for this. These are readily available in online stores such as Amazon, ebay, etc. Do a search for terms such as "12v to 5v dc-dc buck converter with usb output" to find one. Note: For your input (10.8v) you will specifically want one that accepts input voltages less than 12v. Good luck! Let us know what you find. 

For someone in your situation, I would highly recommend looking into an open-source solution called Home Assistant. This open-source app runs on a Pi, and can coordinate the control of a large number of IoT devices from many vendors. Once you get it running and understand the basics, you can then dive deeper and learn to extend it with custom capabilities. I hope this helps! Good luck in whatever you do. (PS: I am in no way affiliated with the team/community of people that make the Home Assistant app. I'm just a user of it, and based on your question I think it might fit your needs.) 

OK, so this is a fairly standard problem on older versions of Raspbian. You need to tell the system to expand the root filesystem to use the available space on the SD card. To do this, follow these instructions: (Optional, but recommended: Go out and re-image with the latest version of the Raspbian OS. As of this writing, that would be Stretch. Jessie is outdated at this time. With Stretch you shouldn't see this problem as it will auto-expand for you.) For older versions: 

Your Pi will reboot. When you login next time, try the command again. The root filesystem should expand now to use up the rest of the SD card space. Write back here to Let us know if this works for you (and if so, please mark this as the answer). Good luck! 

Unfortunately, there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what an IoT Device is, so any specific interpretation, including the one I'm about to give below, could be taken to task. So take it with a grain of salt. When you mention "IoT", most people typically tend to think of small, independent, network-connected, single-purpose devices that are doing things not typically done by a more traditional full-fledged computer (laptop, desktop, etc.). Your specific use-case is similar to that of an electronic billboard or display-only Kiosk, which many consider to be IoT devices. From that angle, you are good-to-go! (Yay). On the other hand, this could have just as easily been done on a laptop, a desktop, or a small "typical" classic PC computer, so there are probably those that would say it's not really an IoT device. I think you could probably tilt your odds toward it being considered as a true IoT device by making sure your solution leans heavily on the "Independent" part of the IoT description I gave above. If it... 

The GPIO on the Pi is essentially Digital, not analog. You can use capacitive timing circuits as shown in the answer from @fred_dot_u above, but this will require some code. Here's another example of the same type of timing circuit. If you are looking for an answer that does not require either coding (to calculate timing) or a proper ADC, then you may just be out of luck. There's no silver bullet for this unfortunately. Going with a non-Pi solution such as Arduino, or (better) ESP8266 or ESP32, may solve your ADC issues since they natively support analog inputs. But, not knowing any of your other constraints, I cannot say if they will be a better bet for you than just grabbing a simple ADC HAT for the PI, or wiring up an MCP3008 directly. Good luck in your quest! 

It might be that the necessary code is not in the new user's home directory. Check out my answer to a similar question here for a possible solution: Why is my username in the terminal not green Good luck! 

Yes, you can connect the LED safely between any GPIO pin that is set for output and the ground pin. For something like this I recommend a setup where you do this for each LED you are adding: 

If you were to implement most of those things, then I think you would be hard pressed to find anyone that could make a solid argument that it is not an IoT device. At least that's my 2 pennies worth. I wish you well in your assignment! 

On newer versions of Raspbian, the SSH service is turned OFF by default for security purposes. This is a good thing, but it causes you to have to go through one extra step before booting it up: 

This is just a WAG (Wild-A**-Guess) based on seeing resource consumption issues in the past that behave similar to your description... The following code looks like it is used to generate PNG images, but I never see any type of cleanup to release the memory/resources used by those images: 

Maybe this is a memory or other resources starvation issue? The app runs fine until memory is used up, then it has to start swapping (which is REALLY slow)? Just something to look at - could be this, or a bunch of other stuff. You might want to start by checking the memory utilization on the device while it runs your code. If it shoots up fast, that may be the issue. Good Luck, and if it is a memory use issue, please reply to let us know! 

Boot into the Pi and login as the user (password=) At the command prompt, type Select the first option The app will go out and apply the necessary changes, then reply with the message Select , then select When prompted to reboot, select 

There are lots of little (and big) tweaks you could do to make this a really solid process optimized for your needs and timings, but this should give you the general idea. I hope this helps! Good luck! Come back here and let us know if this helps! 

I found a good question/answer related to this in another post HERE. Good Luck, and please write back here to let us know what you found! 

For this type of thing I usually recommend MQTT. Here's a good broker/client that will work on both the Pi and your laptop: $URL$ Good luck! 

Assuming you want to take some action on the Pi whenever the flag changes on the remote server, you might want to look into using MQTT, a lightweight message queuing protocol that allows for you to easily have the Pi subscribe to messages that are produced by the remote server. A very good MQTT implementation that should work on both ends is Mosquitto. It's very easy to set up and use for this type of continuous messaging. Good luck! 

Based on the information I can find online (example here), I don't believe the ARM Cortex-A7 used in the Raspberry Pi supports Huge Pages in the L1 TLB, so it most likely won't work properly due to the Hardware itself. If someone finds a more definitive answer, please let us know! 

Most likely when you burnt out the USB ports, you actually fried the USB circuitry on the LAN9514 combo USB+Ethernet controller. If that is the case, then you won't be able to fix it unless you have another 9514 chip and the equipment necessary to remove and replace surface-mount electronics. (Eek!) Regarding using GPIO pins as USB, you would need a full USB software stack with the correct drivers. Unfortunately those drivers cannot exist because the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins are 3.3 volts, and the USB specification requires 5 volts. The amount of current supported by GPIO is also significantly smaller than needed to run USB as well. So as much as I hate to say this, you may have to go get another Pi to solve this particular problem. I really love your way of approaching this problem by not giving up though! Keep up the creative questioning of how to potentially re-use things that are available to you (like the GPIO ports)! Take care and good luck! 

If you cannot get the 3.5" jack working, Android Things also supports USB audio as well. A viable solution might be to just get a $7 USB audio card that has 3.5mm jacks on it, something like this: 

If you are looking to use networked communications I highly recommend a messaging system like MQTT (a good one for the Pi is Mosquitto). And here's a good instruction set on how to install it on the Pi. Please note that the instructions call for using the Debian Wheezy repository, which is now out of date. Replace "wheezy" with whichever version of Debian/Raspbian you are using. As of the time of this answer, the latest is "stretch". Essentially your master pi runs the broker, and the others run clients that publish data to the broker. They can also subscribe to the broker if they need to accept data and/or instructions from it. It's basically up to you how you use it because you configure the topic hierarchy and it just sends whatever you give it to/from the broker. Using MQTT can result in single-digit millisecond-level communication speeds, even on Wifi. If you need faster than that, you should probably be looking at custom GPIO communications like @Milliways mentions in his answer. I hope this helps! 

As of right now (Dec 2017), SunFounder makes a Raspberry Pi sensor kit that you can find on many popular sites for about $50. It has about 20 sensors and the necessary cabling and adapters to use them on breadboards. You will still need to get the Pi, the SD card and the power-supply. But you can find other "starter" kits out there that have those items in them. Hope this helps!
