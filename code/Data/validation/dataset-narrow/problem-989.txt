Here's the maths (and some badly explained music theory) of how the timing works so you can set it up in different times if you want to. We needed to set the project up in beats per minute. 5 seconds pass every 12th of a minute, so ideally we would just set 12 as our bpm. However, Garageband has a minimum bpm of 40, so we choose 48 because it is a multiple of 12. Each beat lasts . We set the project up in the 4/4 time, which means that a beat is a quarter note and there are 4 beats in a bar. We don't care about bars so ignore that. Each beat is a quarter note means that a beat is referred to in our project by 1/4. The echo plugin has a maximum full note length of 1/2 (1/2 = 2/4 so it's two beats) which is equal to . Because of this, we have two echo plugins, both set to 2.5 seconds delay. The second plugin catches the output from the first and delays it again, meaning that the total delay is of course . phew. Sorry it was a bit later than anticipated, my mac decided to run out of battery last night. 

Will add the line "How are you" to the end of This works on both Windows and Unix based OS. (Linux, Mac OS...) On windows, using or in the echo string will output time/date as part of the string. 

I have an Ubuntu 14.04 Server machine set up with 3 drives: Two 2TB HDDs, and a 4GB USB drive for system. It seems that every time I boot the system it changes what drives are assigned to /dev/sd(a/b/c) I need to be able to mount these drives permanently and I can't do that if they're constantly shifting assignments. Is this a problem with the way I'm mounting them, the BIOS or the system software? 

Switcheroo is a nice little chrome extension that redirects addresses to other ones. To use it for your purposes you would: 

I'd use a program called Sharewatch. It allows you to view who is currently connected and what files they are accessing within your shared folders. You can show the user name, IP and computer name of connected users and you can disconnect users that you don't want on your shared folders. Usage is pretty self explanatory - just expand the categories until you see what you need to. Sharemonitor is a similar program that also shows recent access history and saves log files. 

It shouldn't matter at all, as long as there are no defects with either drive. The OS will copy one file at a time until it's done, it won't try to move terabytes of data instantly. It will only run at the speed of the old drive, not break it by trying to pull it all out at USB 3 speeds. 

Once again samba has completely confused me. I need a share which is accessible (r/w) to only authenticated users. Everyone needs to be able to modify others' files, so I'd prefer to use groups for permissions. When I try to connect from my windows machine or my macbook, it tells me that my account does not have permission to access the share. The share directory's group is set to users. The user is in group users. Whenever I type "groups" or "users" neither the added client user nor the group shows up. I also cannot log in using the account "jonah" which I added to test the samba connectivity. I have no clue what the problem is and I need to get this done, so here's my smb.conf. 

I've set up a PPTP server on Ubuntu Sever 14.04. I need to allow a foreign client to access the LAN, but NOT attempt to use my internet connection. When connecting to the VPN the client loses internet connectivity presumably because my PPTP server is not set up to allow use of my internet to clients (which is how I want it). All I want this to do is enable the client to "join" my LAN and access SMB shares on the local network etc. I have tried disabling "default gateway" on the client's connection to the VPN. How do I get this to work as intended? My router is set up to point PPTP to the server. I am going to include the configuration files used to set up PPTP so that people more knowledgable than myself can hopefully pick up on where I've gone wrong. The only thing I've done in /etc/pptpd.conf: 

I use plist editor pro when messing around with iOS apps. It has a nice visual key editor as well as a pure XML view and is free, unlike many others. It's very simple and I think that's why it's so underrated, even though it completely fulfills its purpose as what is basically a jazzed up text editor. 

Now, because the echo plugin only supports timescales of up to 1/2t (not enough), we'll need to repeat this effect, as the current setup will delay after 2.5 seconds rather than 5. The easiest way to do this is to click the preset selector (where it says Manual) and click make preset. Save it as whatever you want. Now, add another Track Echo effect underneath the first one, open its settings by clicking its picture, and select your newly made preset. Finally, make sure your track is blue (selected) by clicking it and press i. This will start monitoring your microphone and repeating what you say 5 seconds later. To stop it, press i again. You can now save the project and open it every time you need this functionality. 

If it's complaining about services, then your best option is to look at the windows services. Try opening your start menu, typing and hitting enter. This brings up the service management window. From here you can look for any audio related services that are disabled and enable them. After that restart your PC and see if it works. If it doesn't, disable it again and try any others. Don't enable them all at once - go through them one by one until you find which one to keep. it is a long process, but keep in mind too many unnecessary services can really slow your PC down. 

It will depend on your speakers/headphones. A computer speaker system will most likely have an amplifier inside it to boost the volume from headphone up to speaker. An online datasheet will likely tell you their maximum volume. If you want an exact figure, you could just put a microphone in front of the speaker and have that monitored by the PC, but as every sound system is different your OS will never be able to tell you the exact dB of the speakers just from its own output. 

I have a PPTP server that I can connect to using its LAN IP, but not using the external IP. My router is set up to forward PPTP to the correct machine and the server can access the internet. However, I cannot use my public IP to connect to the server. Is there a setting in pptpd that blocks external connections, or is this more likely to be a problem with my router? I have successfully used a PPTP server on the same network before. (It was running on the same machine, but the OS has since been reinstalled. Could that have an effect on the current setup? What about assigning it a new local IP?) Running ubuntu server 14.04 

Pretty sure unless you're willing to spare the small expense of pressing fn+←, there's no real option apart from using an external keyboard. I'm sure that you could delve deep into the built in keyboard driver and find something, but it's likely to disrupt other apps if you remap Home. 

As your mac came with garageband, we can use that to implement this. First of all, open a new garageband project (any template) with a bpm (beats per minute) of 48, create a new track using ⌘+⌥+N and select Real Instrument. If the right side panel is already open, then go to the Edit tab. If it's not, then double click the new track at the left of the window (You can ignore the Compressor and Noise Gate, they're turned off). Click in one of the empty spaces and select Track Echo, then click the picture to the left of the newly added effect space (looks like a canyon) to open up the settings. Set it up like this: 

"Users" I know works. The other two directories have been known to cause trouble when moved. Your best option is to always install new software to your secondary drive. You can, however, create individual Junction points (see below) for each folder inside your program files folders. For directories for use by Windows, you need to use NTFS junction points. This means that windows treats the junction point (shortcut) as the actual directory to which it refers, meaning your data will be somewhere else, but your programs won't see any difference. The command for creating them is: 

If you connect a cable router to the LAN port of this one, you should be able to set it up as it's own network. You'll want to set up DMZ on the first router to point all traffic to the second one, and disable it's WiFi if you won't use it. As an example, I have a router in my room connected to the main router downstairs, and it allows me a fast internet connection without having to use WiFi. The problem you may have is if the networks are configured to use the same subnets you might find that you can't access the settings / LAN on the second router. Have a look here if you're not sure what this means. 

If you unplugged your microphone for a bit, then Skype will have defaulted to a loopback/"stereo mix" input device. Try checking in Skype's settings (Tools>Options>Audio Settings) and see what its microphone input is set to. If it's not set to your microphone, then change it. I'm going to advise against rerouting and say find the cause of the problem 

This happened after I'd deleted all my system restore points to save disk space on my 60GB SSD, and run a MBAM scan the day before. Yesterday I downloaded a video file that would not play, though it had all its metadata correct. I dismissed it and downloaded a different version. About 2 hours later windows shouted at me because DllHost.exe was using almost all of my RAM. I killed it and came to the conclusion that the dll used to generate thumbnails had been compromised by the supposedly corrupted file. I tried to delete the video and it instantly came back with the permissions set so that I couldn't delete it anymore. I attempted to log in as the administrator account (which is usually disabled, but without a password) to discover that a password had been set. I plugged the disk into my Raspberry Pi to bypass the windows permissions and successfully deleted the file. I then logged back in to my PC and soon windows explorer was using about 4GB of my RAM. I killed it and attempted to replace it with a backup, but lacked permissions to rename it, which I used to have. I restarted explorer and nothing out of the ordinary happened, and my PC behaved normally for the rest of the night. I turned it on this morning after a bit of thinking, and now svchost.exe was using immense amounts of memory. None of the services running under it were abnormal, so I killed its tree and it came back as expected, but using a normal quantity of memory. After 5 minutes or so it suddenly spiked back up. I installed BitDefender and told it to scan explorer.exe. It stopped working and when I restarted it had no GUI. I told the application to exit and all signs of it disappeared but the process was still running, and RAM usage was starting to climb. I attempted to kill it but task manager said I had insufficient permissions to stop the process, and it now had SYSTEM listed as its user. It seems far too clever to be "regular" malware, and I see no effect of it apart from using huge amounts of memory. It does this when not connected to the internet, so I don't think it's sending my data around. I have now disabled my data drive and turned off the computer. I need to know if this is something that can be fixed or if my best option is to wipe my SSD and reinstall windows. I do have another windows machine that I can use if extremely necessary, but otherwise I need my PC back by saturday. 

This requires that the original folder be moved or renamed before the link is created. You'll also want to do this through the Administrator account so that no files are in use while you're moving files around. Another method (and what I did with my SSD setup) Is to change where windows puts the Users folder. You can do this by changing the registry value to the path to your new users folder. After doing this, I renamed my user profile folder to , restarted the computer, logged into the Administrator account and deleted my user account. I then Created an account with exactly the same credentials and logged into it. After Logging in once I went back into the Administrator account, Deleted the new folder in the Users directory and renamed back to . A restart for luck and I could log in to my old account and all my settings and files were there. As for the missing cmd problem, a system repair disc seems like a valid option. 

Yesterday I could connect to my PPTP VPN and access a SMB server on it perfectly well. Today it is throwing up a bucketload of problems. The VPN is now stopping internet traffic, even though it's set up to use the 192.168.2.x range, and I can no longer connect to the samba share, as the device appears to be invisible. Both servers are running from the same machine running ubuntu server 14.04. I need to know why this happened and how to stop it from happening again. It perplexes me to see that this worked yesterday and is so messed up today. Is there anything that can cause similar effects?
