Yes it could be the reason.I think Your Mysql Data directory is in the /var.You please open your my.cnf(may be you can find it in /etc directory) file and check whether the data directory in /var or not. I think so much space is available in /Home directory and you can use it as your mysql data directory. 

For a long time I’ve wanted to know how MySQL scales as you add more memory to the server.We looked for a balance between utilizing the hardware as much as possible, limiting the system complexity, and lowering the price-to-performance ratio.Please suggest proper solution for this issue. 

With this line root cannot ssh into the box. To become root, ssh in as a normal user then use su - to become root once logged in. 

EventLog Analyzer is a web based, real time, agent less, event log and application log monitoring and management software. The eventlog analyser software collects, analyzes, reports, and archives, Event Log from distributed Windows hosts, SysLog from distributed Unix hosts, Routers, Switches, and other SysLog devices, Application logs from IIS Web server, IIS FTP server, MS SQL server, Oracle database server, DHCP Windows and DHCP Linux servers. The eventlog analyzer application generates graphs and reports that help in analyzing system problems with minimal impact on network performance. 

You want to use Supervisor. It's made exactly for this purpose, plus it will do things like restart the process if it dies, provide a web-based GUI to control it, etc. 

You need to set up either a POP3 or (preferably) an IMAP server. Then create your email boxes there as normal. Use the appropriate PHP functions to simulate a mail client and periodically poll the email boxes for new messages. 

There's a whole bunch of ways to do this. Probably the most popular, modern way is using Kerberos and PAM. The "old standy" is NIS. Some people might point you at OpenLDAP, but keep in mind that LDAP is a directory service, not an authentication service. Attempts to "authenticate off of LDAP" are hacks normally used to shoehorn Linux into an existing Active Directory network. 

is the most reliable way to get a user's IP address when your app is behind a reverse proxy/load balancer. However I don't know what you mean by "trust"? is an HTTP header that can be easily modified by the client or any system between you and the client. You don't want to use it for anything like authentication. 

Have you tried rebooting your router? The fact that some of the servers behind your NAT gateway work, but others do not leave me to believe that the problem is on your end, not Amazon's. If it's a consumer grade device, try updating the firmware. What brand/model is it? 

I got the solution.My ip table is blocking the sqlyog to access server.changed the configuration in the ip table config file and it works smoothly. 

well everyone knows that 'root' (the username) is the admin of your box, so by denying 'root' remote access to ssh into your box you are making it just a wee bit harder for the hackers to get into your box since now they will have to guess a username on your box. 

You can find the all available sessions by using MessAdmin. Its a default tool with Jboss Application Server for administrator's help.Example for accessing Mess Admin shown below $URL$ 

Lately, I've been hearing system administrators and managers ask about solutions to keep people from accidentally removing their data. These are very smart and dedicated people asking for a solution so that data isn't lost either by accident or on purpose. A wild idea I've heard to solve the problem is getting rid of user access to the rm command. Is this truly a crazy idea? Administrators who have users who either accidentally, or sometimes absentmindedly, remove data. The problem they are facing is that the user removes the data, most likely using rm, and then realizes they actually needed the data. Please tell me the best solution to sort out this problem...??? 

In this instance, the OpenVPN would be used to logically extend your LAN. This would allow your devs to connect to the web server, database, etc. as if the EC2 instance was a computer plugged into your network. The alternative is to tunnel everything through a SSH connection using port-forwarding. Each developer would have to manually set up their SSH client to do this and for each TCP port they wanted to connect to. Functionally, these two options are equivalent (and even use the same encryption technology). But a VPN is generally easier for users to use because it "just works". 

Cisco and SonicWall VPN's are both IPSec-based (as are most VPNs used in the corporate world). You can interconnect them if you set up a site-to-site VPN. We do this all of the time with our clients to avoid the same problem you're encountering. Our firewall is just a Linux box running iptables and a IPSec daemon called "Raccoon". You just have to make sure that the dozen or so different settings all match. 

Not unless a) both your providers support BGP and b) they'd be willing to advertise your routes and c) you have your own ASN. Otherwise DNS is your only option. It's not a horrible choice though if you set your TTL really low and using one of the smarter DNS provider that can redirect traffic based on non-responsive ping. CloudFlare is also an option if your site is primarily static information that can be cached and served to users in the event of an outage. Really though, if you truly need this level of HA, you should be hosting in a datacenter. 

There are a number of mail servers that are being used out there (Postfix, qmail, sendmail, etc. See $URL$ for a list of them). You want to do some research into the various ones out there and pick the right one for you as their feature sets and complexity will likely play a part in which server is right for you. Postfix seems to be a very popular choice, often coming pre-installed with many distros. After having chosen one, you need to do some reading on your server of choice. You'll have to learn the various configuration options out there and choose ones that are best suited for your situation. The following mail gives you some idea to configure Mail server $URL$ 

Is there a program to recover emails that I deleted in my gmail account? I've already checked the "trash" and they are gone.Please help me. 

Shell script should not delete any files under* root dir*. My* path will be like /export/home/ftp/ ... I did some research and figured out the way for finding and deleting the files older than 30 days from a specific path, using find and exec commands. *find /export/home/ftp/ -type f -mtime +30 -exec rm -f {} \; But according to the requirement I want to delete console.log and server.log only from that directory and exclude the remaining files. Please help me out in this issue. 

I get a similar story in the Dom0's log. But as you can see, it completely disables the NIC's IRQ and shuts down the interface. 

The problem was a faulty NIC driver. My research indicates that I could have patched and recompiled the driver, but it was easier to just swap in a different NIC. 

From the sound of the error message, it seems like I also need to dedicate eth0 (PCI ID 01:04.0) to the domU. Am I correct? If not, what am I doing wrong? Thanks! 

I am building a CentOS 5.4 system that boots off a compact flash card using a card reader that emulates an IDE drive. It literally takes about an hour to boot. The ultra-slow part occurs when Grub is loading the kernel. Once that's done, the rest of the boot process only takes about a minute to get to a login prompt. Does anyone have any suggestions? I suspect that it may have to do with UDMA. Everything IDE-related in my BIOS seems to checkout. The read performance hdparm is telling me 1.77 MB/s. Ouch! (But even at that rate, it still shouldn't take an hour to decompress and load the kernel) 

I'm using CentOS 5.5 x64 on both the dom0 and domU. I am attempting to pass-through a 3-port NIC (Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8110SC/8169SC Gigabit Ethernet (rev 10)) to the domU using pciback. However, when the first port on the NIC is brought online, it causes the domU to crash. Any suggestions? (eth0 is the on-board NIC, which works fine). Edit: By the way, adding 'swiotlb=force' to the domU kernel line (as recommended in the dump) causes the domU to fail with the same error, only it happens immediately upon launching the vm. 

Please look in to the picture,here am trying to open(with vi editor) my server console log file(around 100MB) and it takes more than two minutes to open with so many special characters.after deleting the first line (means typing "dd")then i can easily view the file and size of the file is also reduced very much.My server OS is RHEL 5.4 and jboss is running in to it. Please help me to avoid such junk characters coming to my server console log files and it helps me to save my valuable space in server. 

This is a list of Internet socket port numbers used by protocols of the Transport Layer of the Internet Protocol Suite for the establishment of host-to-host communications.Pls see the 20 th and 21 entry.The FTP server always receives traffic on port 21. It sends out traffic with a source port of 20 

Basically this is a bug in MySQL that causes the problem but a work around is simple. The problem happens when the Auto-Increment value of a table grows beyond the limit. Just run this SQL query in MySQL to fix the bug. ALTER TABLE AUTO_INCREMENT =1 Table_name is the name of the table where you found the error while inserting data into. Don’t bother about the Auto_Increment value even if you have records in your table. 

Python (by far) is the best all-around language for this type of stuff. It's cross-platform and is used for everything from 3D games to web apps nowadays. Investing the time learning it will give you a very portable skill. Python also has a very clean syntax and easy to pick up the basics. 

This solution still doesn't allow different processes to bind to the same port. And I'm not even sure that I'm on the right track here by looking for an iptables solution. Any suggestions? Is there maybe a hack that be applied in userland? Thanks! 

Wow... you're taking me way back. I used to work front line support at an ISP back when softmodems hit the shelves. Soft modems were sometimes a problem because they didn't do any of the DSP stuff on the modem itself, but within the OS driver. This was cool because you could add new features to the modem with a driver upgrade. It was also the source of many problems because you were relying on Windows to do the job previously left to dedicated hardware. More info at Wikipedia: $URL$ 

First off, you have two conflicting requirements: you don't want a do-it-yourself approach, but you want it cheap. You need to figure out which of those two is more important. What's this server needed for? If it's feasible to host it off-site, you could look at leasing a box at a datacenter (Rackspace, Cari, etc.) You could even get a fully managed server so you only have to worry about the application itself. Of course this extra service is more costly. For the super-cheap start-up route, you could even use Amazon EC2. However, EC2 is going to be more expensive in the long run and you're going to get yoru hands dirty managing it. If it's not feasible to host it offsite (it's also functioning as a file server for the office, etc) then yes, buying a server from Dell (or similar) would be your best bet. The cheapest that you'll likely be able to find a server for sale is from your local off-lease reseller, Craigslist, or Ebay. You can find really nice, recently decommissioned servers for awesome prices. Be aware though that they don't normally come with support though, so once again you'll be on the hook for that. Edit: If you're purchasing used gear, be sure that everything is in order with the OS licensing. If the OS came with the hardware (OEM version), you should be ok. However, larger corporations will sometimes purchase the OS separately from the hardware (MS Open Licensing). That type of license would not be transferable to you when you purchase the box.
