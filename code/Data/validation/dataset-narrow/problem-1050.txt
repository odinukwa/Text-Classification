Boot from a live disc into some linux system to verify it is a windows problem. Reinstall drivers Try to roll back SP1 or did you mean you installed the whole windows 7 recently? Verify there are no hardware conflicts, like several devices on the same irq sometimes causes trouble. In that case try throwing a bunch out and letting windows reinstall them sometimes assigns different irqs. If all else fails, you will have to find users with the same problem and hope they have a solution or debug the system which I suppose you don't want to do. (Google is your friend...) 

I often have to post files on different sites and some websites' forms only have a browse button to upload from your computer. If I have the file on another website, usually I have to go: 

I am using a usb-stick based operating system. So I use different computers and network connections. If I use Vuze for example, could a remote entity (eg a tracker) track my movements by seeing some sort of unique identification for my Vuze installation appear at different ip adresses? If so, is there a way I could change id everytime I start the program to avoid this problem? 

On a domain like truecrypt.org, you cannot see the actual website trough https, but when you download the signatures of their files or their pgp key, they will send it to you through https. However firefox does not seem to give me the possibility to look at the certificate in this situation. What is a practical way of looking at the certificate, preferably without having to install extra tools... 

Using debian wheezy and iceweasel, I somehow managed to have it no longer redering text in pre tags. It still shows the background but no text. This is no color problem, I cannot select anything. I can see the code using "show selection source". I have already tried reinstalling the iceweasel package, and running in safe mode, but to no avail. As a sidenote, it might be more than just pre, the textarea for asking and answering questions on stackechange have it also. The cursor just stays in the left of the textarea and I only see what I am typing thanks to the instant preview. Recent changes to my system is that i tried to install monospace fonts like consolas and inconsolata, which failed (they show as boxes), and that I played around with the system default fonts in gnome tweak tool... However changing settings doesn't resolve the problem on first sight... Tor browser bundle, which has a completely different profile as well as executables also has it. I tested by making some monospace text with css and it still shows monospace fine... Another textarea on a site I am building works fine, I don't know what is special about the ones on stack exchange. I know I am very talented in making software break, but it is really incredible how it can break in such ridiculous ways though... Any clues more than welcome, I am flabbergasted. 

I second the notions about talking to your father. Circumventing his password will only get you into trouble. But, to everyone who thinks you need to do outrageous things (like removing the hard drive) to get Linux root access: The Linux root password is ridiculously easy to work around if you have control of the boot process. All you need is access to the bootloader () or a LiveCD (, mount root device somewhere, , , voila.). BIOS passwords, now, that's a different story. Unless you have the physical access to reset the BIOS. Bottom line, you have physical access to the computer, it's hard to keep you out. Now, original poster, please go back to the top and read the first line again. 

TortoiseSVN provides a powerful "log" dialog showing a list of commits (including who, when, and commit message), plus a list of files modified in that commit, including the ability to easily "click through" to a file's diff for that commit. 

If this is a one-time operation (as opposed to an attempt to keep the two servers in-sync continuously), that's easy. On the old server: 

For compatibility reasons, I need my system (Windows 7) without any .NET higher than 3.5. Unfortunately, it seems that Windows Update will automatically update the .NET framework. While I can uninstall the framework again, Windows Update will keep buggering me with .NET 4 related updates and patches. How can I set it up in such a way that .NET 3.5 stays the latest version of the .NET framework installed? 

I have a fileserver running at home (Synology DS214se) which, among other things, serves my (per controlled NFS). This works just fine for all practical purposes, with one exception: The timestamps on my computer and the fileserver are not completely in sync. This has no practical impact, except for when I software. Every now and then, will give me warnings about "something wrong with the clock", and files having timestamps zero-point-something seconds into the future. Both my computer and the fileserver are configured to use my router (FritzBox) as NTP server. Are these kind of sub-second drifts to be expected with NTP? Is there anything I can do about it? The OS on my computer is Linux Mint 17. The fileserver runs Synology's own DSM 5.2. 

In alot of senses it will be exactly like as if it were a normal drive, so you could lose unsaved data and the file system could become corrupted. It can be kind of annoying if an encrypted file system is corrupt and won't mount anymore, but I if I'm not mistaking truecrypt offers some option to decrypt data without mounting it so you can get on it with traditional tools to recover data. I cannot really give you good references here, but that is from my memory of how truecrypt works. I wouldn't be surprised if the truecrypt documentation talks about this. 

for public keys and: for complete keys (including private part). Where you can supply (partial) fingerprints for KEY1, KEY2 etc. 

At some point today my email client warned about an smtp certificate change of self signed certs. I took a screenshot of the certificate fingerprints and refused the connection because it does not seem to make sense. The server in question has a valid https certificate, but on their website nothing about their smtp cert, nor about it having changed. Now if they answer me that they didn't change it, this is probably an ssl injection and I would like to send them details including which exit node did this. It would also allow me to compare with tested exit nodes like this service: xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/badtornodes/ I must have a default tor logging settup on linux. Where can I find which exit node I was connected to at a given time? /var/log/tor/log seems to have only warnings and upwards in it... 

in a terminal tab that I always leave open (and opens automatically on boot) so I have realtime feedback of all logging from systemd on my computer. If desired, you can use the match filters from journalctl to limit the noise, but for now I like to have everything at hand. 

Somehow I had uninstalled the gnome-session package, probably by uninstalling evolution. After reinstalling that it worked again. 

Eg. have firefox take the file from the cache or download it silently and upload it transparently. I hope I won't have to write that myself... 

I had a debian squeeze, and decided I wanted more modern software versions. I set my repositories to testing and started to run all the updates. I further installed some software. No gnome extensions except for tweak-tool. I definitely rebooted during this whole process. I have my debian on a usb hard drive, so I then took it on another computer and when I logged in the desktop showed only the wallpaper. The black bar on the top disappeared upon clicking "login" and about a second later the black mousepointer turned white. Next nothing. I see the debian wallpaper (the login screen one), not the one I had set up in gnome, and nothing else. No panels, not app switcher, no right click, nothing. I can go to tty with cntr-alt-Fx. Now I brought it back to the machine where I had it working before, but that has the same problem now. I looked around in the logs and on the web, but found nothing much special. Tried restarting gdm, tried reconfiguring gdm and xorg with dpkg. No avail. Im pretty stuck with an unusable system... any hints appreciated. It seems some other people have asked about similar issues, but the answers don't work for me... ps: is there a way to turn on fallback from the command line? 

Compress and copy at your discretion. Look at the help output for further options (like incremental dumps, limiting the dump to certain revision ranges etc.) Then, on the new server: 

Post Scriptum: David Spillett perfectly answered the original question - "how to change the inode size on an EXT3 partition?". The underlying question, however, was "how do I access an EXT3 partition from Windows after I created it with the Linux default values for inode size?". The answer would be Ext2Fsd, which is an EXT3 driver for Windows that doesn't balk at large inode sizes. (It does not, however, support GUID Partition Tables (GPT), required for drives larger than 2 TB.) I thought this might be of interest for the many people who look at this question. 

No entry within a tarball may begin with a "/", i.e. have an absolute path. It's a security feature, so that if you unpack the tarball, you can be sure that all files will reside in the target directory and subdirectories, instead of being scattered all over the system (and possibly overwriting critical files). The warnings you see result from stripping the leading "/" from any absolute paths, both for normal files ("member names") and hard links ("hard link targets"). For example, this command... 

There is a xkbvariant "altgr-intl" that puts the dead keys under the AltGr qualifier; i.e. while typing regularly, keys like are not "dead". If you need them for international characters, you can type e.g. AltGr-" + e to get Ã«. This particular layout is also available for Windows. 

This line resets all environment variables when using , for security reasons. In order to keep the values of etc. in a invocation, you can specify exceptions to via : 

I've got a working Xming / Cygwin installation set up on my Windows. Well, mostly... I did set my home directory to /cygdrive/d in /etc/passwd. When I start the Cygwin Bash Shell (the pimped-up DOS window), this works - $HOME is set to /cygdrive/d, Cygwin finds my ~/.bash_profile, everything is fine. However, when I start an , it starts in , and it does not source my .bash_profile, which is annoying as hell. Sometime during this afternoon, it worked, and now it's broken, but for the life of me I cannot remember how I broke it. Help? Edit: Sorry, I should have been more precise. The xterm is started as , i.e. as login shell. It does find the global profile (because it runs a bash and sets $PS1 correctly), but it obviously gets confused about $HOME (and thus does not run ~/.bash_profile because it cannot find it). I know a way or two to work around it, but I'd like to find the cause of this muckup, not fix the effects. Edit2: Further testing showed that this - $HOME not being set according to /etc/passwd - happens only when the application is started from the Xming / Xmingrc taskbar menu. It's also contagious: Any sub-xterm started from a "broken" xterm opens in the wrong $HOME. Likewise the other way round: Any bash / xterm started outside the Xmingrc menu (that opens in the proper $HOME) can start sub-xterms that also are correct. I'm a bit confused here. 

Please provide a bit more details -- what software/platform are you using to send email?, please provide more details about the undelivery message. There is a tag marked "outlook" with your question, so I am guessing you are using Outlook. I use Outlook 2007 and I am definitely not seeing this problem. I just created a test account with username te'st'@mydomain.com I sent email from my work account (using Outlook 2007) to this test email address. I did not have to do anything special in Outlook. I just entered the address in the "to" field just as I normally do. The email was received just fine. 

Another option is to use soocial.com . You can then sync between Outlook and Soocial as well as between Soocial and Windows Live. So your sync will look somwhat like: Outlook Contacts on PC <==> soocial.com contacts <==> Windows Live contacts ( I have been trying soocial out for the last few weeks. It was working like a charm, until about last week. Since then, its not been syncing with Outlook. It does still sync with Windows Live. I am hoping its a bug that will get fixed soon. ) $URL$ 

Exchange supports IMAP and POP connectors. And at many corporations, these connectors are left enabled (for easy access from platforms that may not have MS Outlook clients, such as unix) If there is an IMAP and/or POP interface enabled in your environment (just ask your sys-admin), then this task will become a lot easier. With a google search, I was able to come with these (some are old, so not sure if they will still work or not): 

I had the exact same problem (using Vista Ultimate x64) after the Vista SP2 update. After I upgraded my audio drivers ( Creative SB X-Fi and Realtek High Definition Audio), my problem got fixed. Here are the steps I followed: Control Panel --> Classic View --> System --> Device Manager In Device Manager, under "Sound, video and game controllers" Right click on each entry and choose "Update Driver Software..." and follow prompts. Choose the "Search automatically for updated driver software" followed by "Yes, always search online (recommended)" to make life easy. Hope this helps. 

That's better, but still not what you want: uses regular expressions, not shell-style wildcarding. The asterisk, for , means "0..n repetitions of the previous character" - a character you did not specify. Close, but no cigar. If you want an "any" pattern, you are looking for "0..n repetitions of an arbitrary character". The latter is represented by the period () in regular expressions: 

I am about to install Linux (Mint) on a first-generation Eee PC. The device is fully sufficient hardware-wise (as I verified using the "Live" environment), except for one thing: The internal storage (~4GB) is not big enough for a full-blown installation. That shouldn't matter that much - it wouldn't be the first network-booting system in my home network that relies on my NAS storage for its root filesystem (the first being a Raspberry Pi happily doing its chores). However, with the Raspberry things were different - I had a fully functional installation, which I merely copied over to the NAS, tweaked the bootloader, and there you are. With the Eee PC, things are differerent. As far as I can see, I would need to install to the NAS mount point, right from the start. However, the installer dialog only shows me /dev/sda partitions to chose from, not mount points. Trying to search the web, I found lots of advice installing from NFS, but none for installing to NFS. Anyone having an idea? (Like, wrapping the NFS mount in some way so the installer "sees" it as a block device? Something like that? Or something completely different?) 

I am using a private user group setup, i.e. a user 's home directory is owned by , not . For this to work, I need to set the umask to 002 globally. After a quick , it seemed for a moment that modifying the entry in should do the trick. It does, too -- but only for console logins. If I log in to my desktop, and open a terminal there, I still get to see the default . Same goes for files created from apps started through the menu. Apparently, the display manager (or whatever X11 component responsible) does source some different setting than a console login does, and damned if I could tell which one it is. (I tried changing the setting in , and no, it did not help.) How / where do I set globally (and for all users), so that the X11 desktop environment gets the memo as well? (The system is Linux Mint / Ubuntu, in case that changes anything...)
