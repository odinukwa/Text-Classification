By default, an ASA will not include VPN-tunneled routes into the routing table. Since they are not technically in the routing table, BGP cannot advertise them with a statement. Setting a Reverse-Route allows the route to be injected into the routing table. It is enable in the crypto map portion of the VPN. Example: 

Cisco has a large listing of Syslog Messages and Severity level here: Syslog Messages This list includes Syslog Messages for the following: 

There is another feature of to consider: External Routes. One trick I have used to influence EIGRP Primary and Secondary paths over DMVPN is to use a dedicated EIGRP AS for the secondary path and then redistribute it into the primary AS. Redistributed routes will be injected into the EIGRP process as External Routes. Externals Routes will have an AD (Administrative Distance) of 190 by default and therefore be less preferred. This is not always optimal nor can it always be applied in all use-cases but it is something to consider. 

There are a few strategies to deploying AnyConnect. The Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Administrator Guide, Release 4.4 describes them in detail including client prerequisites and configurations. 

The simplest solution would be to add a dynamic routing protocol such as , or . Then raise the Administrative Distance of the static routes so the dynamically learned routes are preferred. These static routes with the higher administrative distance become floating static routes. 

Interface F0/0 and F0/1 on R1 are misconfigured. R1 interface F0/0 is configured for instead of . R1 interface F0/1 is configured for instead of . I recommend either "swapping" your cables or re-IP addressing your interfaces. 

R1 likely does not have a route to and R0 likely does not have a route back to . By default, a router will add connected routes into its routing table. This means that R1 will know how to get to , and . The router will not dynamically share or learn its routes with other routers without a dynamic routing protocol such RIP, OSPF, EIGRP or BGP. A router can be configured to statically install routes as well. A common example is a default route or "all zeros" route. One solution would be to run a dynamic routing protocol across R0 and R1. Another solution would be to manually configure static routes on R0 and R1. Static Routes 

Plug your internet into the same firewall. Then you can have ACLs for your servers, hosts and internet if you want to use the firewall that way. We plug lots of networks into firewalls for some customers. Some firewalls record traffic patterns much better than a router. If someone tries to access the financial server from inside the network you'll have record of it for example. (if you have a capable firewall) 

You can do DHCP and Routing from vlan to vlan with an ASA5516. It's a little more complex with the rules and it doesn't do sub-interfaces like router on a stick. It's more like an SVI (switched virtual interface) of a layer 3 switch. An SVI is a fancy way of saying create a vlan, set the ip address of that vlan interface on the ASA or switch and use it as the gateway. Traffic is seperated on each port by vlan tags similar to the sub-interface idea (on a router the encapsulation dot1q command on a sub-interface is identifying the vlan tag to look for). This below is beyond answering your question and I apologize if I'm butting in. Just trying to offer some advice. If you plan to get an ASA5516 with firepower do your research. Its a complex venture. I just installed one for a school with 1500 people. Each feature requires a license/subscription. You'll need anyconnect vpn licenses if you want more than the 2 it comes with. If you want historical data you MUST have a VMWARE esxi server to load the Cisco created VM. No other virtual environment works. (Some have manipulated virtual box but I don't trust that in production personally). You use seperate rules to direct traffic to the firepower module. It's a VERY expensive and complex device for a 75 person business. If i may make a suggestion, I personally suggest put some money into a router or a decent layer 3 switch to take the load off the sonic wall to start. An HP2930 (labeled Aruba now) may even do the job (no cisco routing protocols but most small business are static routes anyway). It extremely easy to program. I think the Cisco 2960x switch is now offering similar routing as well (you could check) Let the sonic wall manage in and out traffic only. For the money of that ASA you could put a layer 3 switch and route at each closet (and then buy a used car...lol) but it sounds like that's not necessary with 75 users and under 250 devices (I'm guessing). One layer 3 device should suffice. It would be your mixed core and distribution layer. You would plug your servers, wifi controller, phone system, etc... in it if you can. Your backbone devices basically. It would be a good start. I'm not always brand partial but for non-network engineer types or I.T. folks that don't have the opportunity to get good with cmd line because they are so busy now days, the HPs enterprise grade procurve switches have a Web gui that's hard to beat. The 2920s now called 2930s have proven themselves in my opinion very well especially for the price. Edit... I also agree with the comment above. If you can move dhcp to a windows server that will give you more control and more insight. If your AD server isn't a dedicated AD server you may run it from there. If you have an inside DNS server that could be a good place as well since your network ip helpers go there already. Good luck Fixitrod HP Switch Selector HP Aruba 2930f switch Datasheet 

Note that by themselves, VLANs do not enhance security. They simply limit broadcast domains. If the world was only as big as your diagram above, sure, traffic would always be isolated within a single VLAN. In the real world, traffic needs to be routed in order to be useful. You must control traffic between the VLANs with a layer-3 aware device such as a layer-3 switch, router or firewall. 

In the event of all things equal and the routing process supports it, equal-cost load balancing will occur. Exactly how the router handles the load-balancing depends on your configuration, version of IOS and potentially your router platform. Cisco dives into the matter with the following documents. 

$URL$ The line up/down Message ID can be found in the "Cisco ASA Series Syslog Messages" documentation. 

You can only deactivate Time-Based Keys as per the Cisco Documentation. The permanent key must be replaced with another permanent key with fewer features. 

You are receiving the error because the "password" you are entering is not a proper MD5 hash. Check to verify that you are trying to enter a complete MD5 hash and that it is not another type of hash. Cleartext, Type 4 or Type 7 passwords will not suffice. You may be trying to use a password obscured by a Vigenère cipher. The Vigenère cipher is often refered as a Type 7 password. It is associated with the and commands. Type 7 password hashes look something like this: 

I admit, I have never attempted this before. However, it appears you should be able to with a properly configured custom "Event List". According to the Cisco ASDM User Guide (excerpts): 

The author of your reference article does not appear to fully understand or clearly illustrate the relationship of Bandwidth/Latency. 

Prefix Length - The longest-matching route is preferred first. Prefix length trumps all other route attributes. Administrative Distance - In the event there are multiple routes to a destination with the same prefix length, the route learned by the protocol with the lowest administrative distance is preferred. Metric - In the event there are multiple routes learned by the same protocol with same prefix length, the route with the lowest metric is preferred. (If two or more of these routes have equal metrics, load balancing across them may occur.) 

I was corrected. Iogin via the console cable to ios has no enable password. I posted the below. I thought some older IOS's used cisco but I can't find evidence of that. To many diffrent devices to keep straight I guess. These below are logins, not direct to ios. Username:Cisco Password:Cisco Or Username:cisco Password:cisco and some Username:blank Password:Cisco or cisco 

People sometimes set these up wroth password of cisco or Cisco but there is no out of box default... 1st option start guessing 2nd option... If you have a copy of the config and the password is encrypted with type 5 or 7 enter at this website to get the password. 3rd option is follow the password recovery procedure given by Cisco. Follow it stop by step. I'll put it below. 4th option. If you don't care what's on the switch this may be the way to go from the start. I'll add steps below the recovery 

It appears you restarted the switches with the reload command first (proper restart). That's the rom with reload. The reset time appears to be the time somebody restarted it diffrently like pulling the plug. If you had issues with the update I'm guessing hours later somebody pulled the plug and possible did some work on them to get them to boot. 

Backup your current config and use the following commands after your own research and your own risk. I typed all this on the fly so I may have missed something. Please backup your config before testing this. After setting these commands you need to add the gateway address to your devices. The VLAN interfaces we create below will be the gateways for those networks. If you already use a gateway for your current network do not add the interface vlan command for that vlan. Add another route like I did at the bottom. I'll put an example. Also, just a note, vlan 1 isn't suggested to use as a security measure. Most sites do, but I wanted to make the note. 

Configurations should be sync'ed unless commands have been sent to the Secondary unit directly. If you suspect otherwise, a configuration comparison should be made. Some other recommendations are listed below. Ask any engineer and they will likely have additional recommendations. 

Depending on your use-case, a simple work-around could be to use VPCs or the pre-built Ubuntu Docker appliance as hosts instead. 

Aside from CLI show commands, you may want to look into 3rd party software with traffic visibility. I cannot give specific names as applications and vendor recommendations are off-topic. However, there are a lot of options out there that give granular visibility of the traffic flows and break them down and track traffic tags such as IP ToS. Look for applications with NetFlow support. Cisco basic NetFlow v5 will track the following information: 

By default, the router will install the route learned via EIGRP into the routing table. This is because EIGRP has a lower Administrative Distance than OSPF. It should also be noted that both learned routes will remain in their respective routing processes. Thus, the router knows about both but will only select one route when routing. Routers select routes in the following order: 

WAN interface is a vague term but it has a couple widely used meanings. @RonMaupin has given a great description of what WAN interfaces mean to enterprises. In addition to his description, I would also add BGP as another important WAN edge protocol. However, WAN interfaces often have a slightly different meaning for SOHO and Small Business networking devices. The WAN interface is often a routed interface with a few additional features preconfigured. The features are bulleted below. The remaining ports on such a device are often switched interfaces. The purpose is to accept an ethernet handoff from a device such as a cable modem or DSL modem and provide internet access to the switched ports/interfaces. 

While you may not be able to tell whether queues are explicitly being congested from the reports, you are often able to tell whether tags are being properly applied and honored. 

If your two devices are on the same physical network or vlan you can give your computer nic two ip addresses. In windows give your nic a static address. Click advanced at the bottom of the Nics properties page. From there you can add a second address that can communicate with 192.168.120.1 device like 192.168.120.2. Layer 2 networks don't really "care" about the ip addresses but the devices do. That's why this is possible. I use this method all the time when setting up devices. If you don't want to do that nat or regular routing are your options. If you are simply trying to communicate and use Dd-wrt this is the basic idea. Keep in mind this is a home/small business router normally. Set your "internet port" or "Wan port" (this is the terminology used on most home routes, it's just a routed interface) as 192.168.120.2. Plug in your device. Make the lan side (which is like giving the vlan the switch ports are using an ip address or in Cisco is called an svi) 192.168.1.2, plug in your laptop. Dd-wrt will allow the two networks to route. If you must connect to a 192.168.1.### address then add the nat and port forwarding. There are tabs for port forwarding and the tab for nat is called nat/QoS I Dd-wrt. Link to a tutorial here 

Our company bought new Sophos firewalls and doesn't want me to troubleshoot the ASAs anymore. I'll put this as an answer to keep it from popping up unless there is another way. Hoping this issue doesn't raise its head with the new firewalls! Thank you for your help. 

If a switch has 3 subnets and the global gateway points to a router that has routes to all 3 subnets from whatever network your management computer is on then you can manage the switch with any of the addresses on the switch. The reason is when you point to the gateway with that one address the router will look at the data and route it properly, as long as it has an interface with the proper subnet. I think i understand why your asking thing. If a computer had a gateway address from a diffrent subnet it wouldn't work.
