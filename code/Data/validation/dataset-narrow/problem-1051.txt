I may delete this based on your answer, but if you are using the same username, it will assume you don't mind kicking yourself off, but it will ask both sides if they want to do it if they are different users. I tested with a standard user currently logged in, and an administrator connecting to make sure it would still ask. 

What model system do you have? I would download "System Information for Windows" free here: $URL$ . Look specifically at the Hardware>System Summary, Hardware>Motherboard and Hardware>Memory. With all that information, and you can post it back here, you will be able to tell everything you want to know. 

This one reviews very well (4/5), and was lean when I installed it (only 36K) on a test comp. You don't say what OS, but it is also tested through Vista, so probably also runs on Windows 7. It is freeware. $URL$ (Anti ScreenSaver). 

There is a limit of 4GB (in some instances, only 2GB) on a folder: $URL$ There is apparently no way to lift the cap other than to "configure the mail directories and/or the Local Folders directory to be stored outside of the profile", as in the link. 

Then go to Extra>Options>Security and set a password. This is going to be pretty secure, but if you want extra security, install it with the VPN option. This whole thing is VERY easy to set up and to use. Once you run it, it has a great file transfer option. You can also use it when you are not at home, and still connect as long as her computer is connected to the Internet. 

OK, I installed that on a test VM, and had all the same errors you did when trying to ininstall it. I did a little search of the registry for Sony here: 

Yes, you have clogging. That can happen when the ink sits there and dries out. In most cases, you just lose a cartridge, but in this case, yours in in the printer. Here are some links that you can follow to help you try to fix it. $URL$ (I like the idea of putting alcohol in your old cartridge to run through the system) $URL$ (searching youtube for "fix clogged inkjet printer" returns more people fixing their printers). 

Watch this video on how to install XP on a USB drive, and boot to that: $URL$ Borrow an empty drive, and swap it out. Do a quick OS install and run the update from there. Use Easeus Partition Manger to resize, and create an empty partition AFTER your current partition. Then install Windows there. 

There are no performance benefits (you are still writing to the same, one, drive). Personally, I use them as one big chunk. I only partition my main internal drive into System (C:) and Data (D:), otherwise, unless you have another logical divider like that that you REALLY want to use(like movies on one partiton, and songs on another), one partition is fine. 

I would image the disk first if the contents are extremely valuable. Then run chkdsk, try to decompress them, then chkdsk again. Personally, I don't trust compressing files, and never do it. It is just one more thing that potentially can go wrong. 

What you could do is edit your C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\HOSTS file, but it only supports IP to name mappings. Edit: Josh King brought up a very good point about a third party application. My favorite is Visionapp Remote Desktop. Although newer versions are paid, version 1.5 was free, and is still available on the Internet, like here: $URL$ Among its features is that you have multiple desktops open simultaneously, and they are tabbed (I had two open for the screenshot), so they are very easy to switch from one to another. You can also have multiple credential sets, and have the inherit, or specify them on a connection-by-connection basis. You can also order the calculations alphabetically, and even add them to folders. 

We use LeapFile: $URL$ It is not free, but it is very reliable, and it works great. Read the "Why LeapFile" web page for more info: $URL$ 

For brochures, while you can get very good results with a standard high-quality printer for what you are looking to spend, you likely will not get the same results as a professional printer, and you may not be totally pleased with the results (read, you wasted a lot of money). For brochures, most smaller print shops don't even do them themselves, and send them out to places that have equipment costing 100's of thousands of dollars. They don't use standard printers to get the best results. Farm it out. $URL$ (go to the section on commercial printers). 

I looked at the registry pretty deeply, and the Live Messenger settings myself, and could not find a thing, so I checked the Internet. This seems to be a very common request (to open Outlook, or even gmail in a web browser), but I found more than one Microsoft MVP (so they tend to be pretty good with MS products), who confirmed what I thought: You can't do it. Sorry. 

Larry, I do not know why you do just get repartitioning software. For a server, it costs some money for a commercial product (you can try a free one like GParted), but it will save you a lot of effort...and time is money. I recommend Acronis Disk Director. Not being a professional, and I am not trying to be condescending, you are risking A LOT. First, your use of XCOPY is going to cause you untold problems because it does not copy the ACL (permissions). You need to use robocopy from the Windows resource kits. With Acronis, it is simple and fast, and if something goes wrong (and I have never had this happen), you have a support team to fall back on. 

First, your keyboard may simply be broken. It does happen, but before you have to consider replacement, you can try these basics to cleaning sticky keys: 

You can also play around with the command with options similar to this: The /o-d-s sorts them by date and size, the - means do it newest first and largest first, and the /tc means use the create date. The /s is common and searches sub-directories, and the only annoying thing is is that I cannot get it so sort the entire drive as one unit, rather than by directory. 

It will almost certainly work, and do NAT (translating your public IP to many non-routable internal IPs). It would help to have the model number to guarantee it, but as long as it is a router with wireless, and not a pure wireless access point, that is the market D-Link is in. 

Google, being so big, has many servers. When you ping www.google.com, you are pinging a DNS entry that is a CNAME, which is an alias that points to multiple servers, which operate in a round-robin setup. So if you ping it again, you may not get the same server to respond (once your DNS cache clears). That CNAME/DNS round robin setup servers up one server after another for request after request. This also allows them to bring a server down for whatever reason, like maintenance, and not skip a beat. 

I would say it is simply coincidence. With so many sectors, some are going to go bad, even on a new drive. I know of no way your motherboard can cause this. 

4GB is all you theoretically can address based on the 32-bit OS, minus a portion for video memory, usually bringing it down to 3.25GB on most current systems. You would need to go to 64-bit Vista for it to see all your memory. If you decide that you want to re-format and do that, if you can get the media (if you have an OEM version, you need a 64-bit OEM version disk...you can probably purchase this cheaply from the manufacturer of your PC), there is no difference between 32-bit and 64-bit licensing for the same version of the OS (32-bit Vista Ultimate to 64-bit Vista Ultimate). Your same product key will work. Do a full backup of your data first. 

Install and run CCleaner. Make sure that all the service pack and hot fix uninstalls are deleted from c:\windows (they are hidden folders, and all start with $) Run windirstat and see if there is anything else that is large, and taking up space. 

The answer is normally no. Usually, it is some kind of user error, and they don't even realize they did it. I would check my backups (see what file list a restore gives you), and compare them to the contents of the current folder, that will tell you for sure if the user is simply mistaken, which I have seen 100% of the time. In my experience, they always have accidentally draged a folder into another folder. If they can tell you the name of a specific file a simple will find where they accidentally move it to. Another option: I don't know if you have Shadow Copies enabled, but if so, right click on the share, and then the "Previous Versions" tab. You may find something there too, but I am not sure if moving the file also moves the shadow. 

You cannot do it the way you are trying, at least per Microsoft. I quote: "Names can contain a period (.). However, the name cannot start with a period." It is probably hardcoded to work that way. $URL$ 

It probably is the motherboard, and you are right, if it is that, not worth fixing. The only other things it could be would be the power supply or battery. It may be hard to borrow a compatible power supply, but if you can, I would. I would also try it without the battery installed. 

If you are an administrator on the network, you can just do it at a command prompt: net user user_name new_password I tested this...will add more if I can find a way to do it for domain non-administrative users. Just another point, which may not help you, but if you have access to Outlook Web Access 2010 (2007 if your administrator made special modifications), you can change your password in the options. P.S. I came across this: This is pretty cool for just locking the workstation: rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation Note: Comments below were in response to my initial answer, which has been changed. 

Of course, the reason they can use less is that they are using memory in the first place to do the storage, so it is already reasonably fast compared to a traditional hard drive, whereas the harddrive needs that cache memory more to make it perform better. If is also doubtful that they use enough to even warrant listing it as a feature, and it would probably look bad in comarision to traditional drive specs, so they opt to leave it out. $URL$ 

To be honest, I don't think so any more. I just played with that registry key, and changed the values from 0-9, but in each case, unless it was set to 0 or 5, it gave me my Favorites, not Shortcuts as in 2003. The /select switch lets you select a folder, but "Shortcuts" is not a folder, so it does not work. I think the best bet may be to add your Shortcuts as Favorites instead (and set the registry value to 6). That might be as close as you get, and it seems pretty close to me, at least for Outlook folders...Internet shortcuts are another story. Hit CTRL+1, then right click any of the folders at the bottom you want to add to your Favorites. 

You picked the only web camera I have, so I plugged it in and looked at the settings in the application. There is no way to turn it off. Since the area of the blue light is black, I would cut a small piece of black electrical tape and just cover it since it is causing issues. 

Tom Wijsman, the proper sequence for troubleshooting connectivity is (and I detailing this because I am not sure what you have done as of yet, and I am not writing this just for you): For the computer in question, let's assume a local IP of 192.168.1.100, subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, and a gateway of 192.168.1.1. For this explanation, 192.168.1.200 is another local computer that is known to answer pings. We are looking for replies. Before you start, turn off your software firewall. For home users, in your TCP/IPv4 Properties>Advanced>DNS it is usually sufficient to only have "Append primary and connection specific DNS suffixes" and "Append parent suffixes of the primary DNS suffix" checked, which is the default.
