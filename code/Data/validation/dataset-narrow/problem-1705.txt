Late answer, but recently experienced it. I noticed the interface is down. Yours is down too. Running on an updated firmware solved my problem. Not sure how that happened, as the people from this raspberrypi.org thread insists on downgrading. 

That’s it! Now you can enjoy all your GBA games on your RaspberyPi. Totally not copy-pasted from here. Full credits go to the original author. I do not, in any way, claim that this is my work. 

It should continue playing in the background. One caveat of this is that I'm not sure how to integrate this into a script (haven't done any research at the moment). I'm guessing it's possible. EDIT: Check Patrick Cook's comment. 

Have you tried opening it using ? You sometimes need to explicitly mention your HTML file's file name. Make sure the Python file and the HTML file are in the same folder. 

All of these come packaged up in a nice little box that you can order from The Pi Hut for £5.00 (inc. VAT), €6.26 (inc. VAT), or $8.39. There are also several free (6 currently, 8 planned) worksheets/projects that you can do with your Pi and the CamJam EduKit that you can download from the CamJam EduKit page on the CamJam site. Hope this helped some! 

I doubt it. There weren't any real changes to the core components or software of the Pi, the SoC remains the same, as well as the chip driving the USB/Ethernet. The changes were simply the extra USB ports, more GPIO, a new power circuit, a new port for audio/component video, and a redesigned board. Thus, if the Model B didn't work, I don't think the Model B+ will either. 

I have heard that the serial interface on the Pi 3 may have problems (something to do with Bluetooth), but I haven't encountered it in recent times. It may have already been fixed. $URL$ 

Low voltage. Your adapter probably can't handle a Pi. Go get a better one, preferably one that can handle 2A. 

It's already working since you can connect to it. Putty would give a error otherwise. In this case, make sure you typed the password correctly. If you did not change it, the password should be . Another possibility would be you're connected to the wrong machine. 

Yes, it can be overclocked. Here are the details: The Pi bootloader still follows the overclocking parameters that's usually placed in the file despite not having any overclocking settings for the Pi 3. doesn't have any of the overclock good stuff since the Pi 3 doesn't officially support overclocking. Basically, what you'll do is manually edit those parameters in said file. I'll assume you're already familiar with the Pi so I'll leave out the how-to-edit part. My stable frequencies were at 1.4 GHz for ARM, and were at 500 MHz. 7 overvolt. 

Have you looked into putting the the root file system on to an external HDD or USB pen drive? It's faster (in the case of the external HDD, as for the USB stick it is actually slower) and it extends the life of the SD card, as the SD card is simply used for booting; the root file system is stored externally. This also makes backups/restores easier, as well as transferring files. Here's the site I read about this on: $URL$ and here: $URL$ From the first post: 

and changing the index from -2 to 0 via adding to the file. However, this wasn't working. The correct way to do it is to add followed by . Essentially what doing this is forcing the default sound module () to be disabled while the usb sound module () is enabled. What I believe was previously happening with just adding was that the module and the were conflicting, with both being enabled. 

Now that a game ROM is in the directory and a copy of the bios file is in the correct location go into EmulationStation with 

Absolutely DO NOT connect the battery in parallel with the load. The charger will not know if the battery is full or not and will continue to pump power both to the battery and the step-up converter. Since the battery is still receiving power and is still charging, it will overcharge and explode. If you want to do this properly, you should use a proper LiPo charge controller with an integrated power output (link) which will eliminate the charger+booster combo in your setup. The module linked above is featured on Adafruit's blog (link). You can also search the internet for something similar and cheaper than that. 

If the dpkg command fails, try running and then touch a new one via . Fixed another user's problem here: raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=11824. 

I have recently messed around with Sonic Pi and I have got it to play MIDI notes (via .) However, I am attempting to follow the guide to SonicPi in the MagPi issue 23 and it told me to enter as my first command. I did so and pressed ran. However, I am getting this error: 

I believe it may have been a battery/sync issue. I've used it since and I had to swap the batteries out and re-sync the keyboard and receiver. Granted, this was on Raspbian this time, but I believe it should work with NOOBS as well. Sometimes the answer is the simplest thing, just sitting there waiting to facepalm you. 

A male-male USB-USB cable won't work. You have to make your PC act as a USB slave which is not possible for regular users and/or because of the hardware. PCs are almost always master-only. The Pi also thinks it's a master. We can't have two masters or else one or both of them will break and/or literally burn or, in the best case, the connection simply won't work. Also, going without adapters is not possible for regular users. You'll need adapters. Just go buy a cheap WiFi/Ethernet adapter if you want it cheap. It will save you the hassle. It's also cheaper considering you have to replace your PC/Pi when something breaks because of totally unnecessary tinkering (unless you're a hardware hacker, then I encourage you to do it). Going with adapters is the cheapest and the best way (if not the only way). If USB is not your thing, there's ENC28J60. It connects using the SPI port on your GPIO pins. 

The smaller partition is going to be your boot partition. In Raspbian it is anyways. I have yet to use NOOBS very much, so it may be different. The first is also most likely the boot partition, so just take the Disk name (...) and then tack on and the partition Number (marked below): 

which perfectly describes my issue, but I have no clue why this hasn't popped up before! I am going to re-image another SD card and see if that works, but I really hope that this hasn't fried my Pi's ethernet and USB ports! Basically, my questions are, 

This feature was available when using firmware from 12/04/2012 or later. However, this feature is removed from default firmware as of 18th March 2014. NOOBS still supports a safe mode, using the same gpio pins. If you are using a firmware version between 12/04/2012 and 3/18/2014 and wish to learn more about this, you can read a topic on the Raspberry Pi official forums and on the eLinux page. 

First of all, make sure you use the proper kernel headers. I assume that your kernel headers and source code are more updated than the kernel you're running. Try to do an then reinstall the module. If the problem persists, triple check that your kernel headers match your current kernel, recompile again then try to install. 

I assume you're working on and its subdirectories. If not, simply change to the correct directory (in you case, ). I recommend you use the default and move your files over there. Not sure how got write permissions there but here are some pointers: 

Don't forget to enable IPV4 (or V6) packet forwarding. I wasted a month of my life figuring that out. 

I believe this is what you need. As of right now, I believe your code is attempting to run the function within SQLite, and I don't believe SQLite has that. EDIT: My bad, you probably can't execute a command within a Python SQLite command/connection. This should fix it: Correct 

Welcome to Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange! I googled and found (on the official Adafruit instructions page for the TFT) that their files (the drivers/modules needed to run the TFT correctly) are for Raspbian only. You could compile your own kernel using their Patchfile but Adafruit doesn't have any tutorials and don't plan to support this in any way. Source: 

One thing you could do if you want to have a more stable Pi is to just use the SD card to boot the Pi and then shift to using an external HDD or USB device. This is common solution to SD card reliability, check here
