What I expect to happen: Vim should appear in the "Other Programs" list What happens: Vim does not appear anywhere in the list, the first choice on the list (notepad) is still selected. Some advice I saw online indicated that I should add a registry entry that the installer missed. So I added "C:\Program Files\vim\vim73\gvim.exe" "%1" to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Applications\gvim.exe\shell\open\command]. This didn't seem to help. Any idea what I'm missing here. EDIT: well, this is interesting. I can set vim.exe to be the default application, just not gvim.exe. 

For various reasons, I was stuck using vim.exe instead of gvim.exe on windows recently. One of the only irritating aspects of this was that the alt-key did not work. (Mouse didn't work for scrolling either). When I tried to use alt-up (arrow), I got an 'I'-like character inserted instead of my chosen mapping. 'ga' lists it as 206, Hex 00ce, Octal 316. Any idea what this is or how to fix this? (vim 7.3, windows xp) 

Well... I got it working, but this is ugly. Registry hack [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.cpp] : (Default) : gvim And then create: [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\gvim\shell\open\command] : (Default) : "C:\Program Files\vim\vim73\gvim.exe" "%1" 

No, this is not true. However, you can end up with corrupted data, since the data wasn't recoverable from the original drive. When a drive has a bad sector, the drive firmware uses various tricks to try to recover the data (flying closer to the disk, increasing the tolerance on the signal detection system, simply trying to read it a dozen times and hoping one of them works, etc), only if all of that fails... the drive reports an error back to the operating system. What happens now depends on which knobs the operating system has turned. The drive typically tries to blacklist that sector and returns some pregenerated data (usually 0's, although this is configurable) back to the computer. For subsequent writes to that location, the drive internally remaps those sector addresses (LBAs) to a special section of the drive dedicated to such things. Most hard drive errors are never seen by the user, since modern drives are fairly good at recovering data on their own. Some types of drive errors, such as bumps on the surface of the disk or damaged heads... have a tendancy of "spreading" across the drive. Causing you to lose more and more data as time goes on. If you are seeing errors persistently, you should be getting rid of that disk quickly... since you may have filled that section of the drive used for overprovisioning, or simply have ALOT of errors. 

Another alternative (and yes, I realize this question is several months old), is to convert from your svn checkout. Just make sure you do a complete checkout (generally one level above your /trunk) and run on that. 

I seem to have a knack for figuring out my problem, just after posting here on SU. In this case, it turns out that cdcontrol needs the /dev/cd0 (ATAPI interface) to provide that little status message "No volume level info available". A simple and it was working as I remember it. (and added to my loader.conf, of course) 

I would like to be able to tell if the CD drawer is closed, with a disc present, on FreeBSD 8. Back in FreeBSD6, I could use which would return "No volume level info available" until there was a disk present. In FreeBSD 8, it returns "Left volume = 255, right volume = 255" no matter if a disc is there or not. 

i have over 500 (50MB) .tif files and i want to convert them to .png i have tried nconvert and find it working, but there is no multithreading, is there a simple way of doing it in a bash or batch script? preferably windows but cygwin will work to 

the graphics manufacturer stated power is maximum, but as a rule of thumb, most tech savy people use atleast a 430W psu or higher like a corsair CX500W power supply to power a Radeon R9 270 graphics card with the cpu and everything else it all depends on what else you have in your system, what cpu?, what motherboard?, how many harddrives/ssds 

it depends on the laptop some have real easy way to replace RAM, HDD/SSD and Wifi, but others dont, (ram soldered to mb etc) and no you cannot upgrade the CPU (unless you want to change 80% of the laptop), why would you want to?, the cpu is tied to the fans, so if you install a faster cpu, the fans wont keep up and sometimes the chassis is made for that cpu anyhow i agree with james 

cores and memory type/speed is two factors that count alot ' and it also depends on the manufacturer , nvidia has less cores but they are faster compared to the high number of amd ones use in theirs gpus, but they are around same performance level a 1600 cores (stream units) gpu with GDDR5 5000mhz is faster than a 1600 cores (stream units) gpu with DDR3 1600mhz another example is a 1400 cores (stream units) gpu with GDDR5 6000mhz can be close to a 1600 core (stream units) gpu with DDR3 1600mhz there is no single factor, unless you count benchmarks 

i almost have the same setup and i use AMD Eyefinity3 with U2412M 1920x1200 off a radeon HD 7970 You can also make it a single surface $URL$ You can find eyefinity cards for every price bracket. I do recommend a midrange. not the lowest end. just because its nice to have a little 3d perf than none at all Radeon R7 360 and R7 370 etc (Important! pick the one with DisplayPort+HDMI+DVI) Demo of eyefinity from Guru3D $URL$ and i almost forgot AMD Kaveri based APUs support eyefinity as well (max 3 displays) 

Setup Tinc VPN on both the machine and watch magic happend $URL$ Tinc will create a virtual private network over wan (the internet) and if you have a fast outbound bandwidth it will stream video/audio just fine, i have tried it a few times and it plays pretty reliably inside tinc tunnel (windows share) 

do you find it in device manager? $URL$ and it does sound like you have installed wrong driver, what kind of wifi card is it? atheros, broadcom, intel? 

You will need to install windows 7 on the device and run "Get Windows 10 (GWX)" and reserve your copy worked for me, i fished out a ancient 7 install media with key 

have you tried openvpn-as $URL$ its free for 2 users if he uses windows or mac viscosity is a good openvpn client $URL$ or the openvpn option in the network-manager in ubuntu/Linux another option is to use SSH Tunneling Windows $URL$ Linux $URL$ 

am trying to figure out how to partition with parted i want to create 2 partitions first partition with EXT4 maximum size and one the second partition with 16MB FAT16 

have you tried checking your system memory and ssd/hdd? sometimes the driver can crash by a corruption in the system memory or disk try taking out one stick of ram and change os drive.. etc also try running GPU-Z and see if its overheats $URL$ 

This is an issue thats bugged me for a couple years. I have a Netgear FWG114P Router here at home, and I never got it working with my company VPN. I could always connect to the VPN, and then after about two minutes, I'd get dropped. The tech guy at work and I tried everything. We had the same issues with my wife's company VPN. The only suggestion that worked was to pack up the Netgear Router and then buy a Linksys one. The Linksys router has worked just fine out of the box and both our VPN connections work great. Now I'd like to extend my wireless network to a distant corner of our house, so I'd like to bring the Netgear out of retirement. Anyway, anyone else have issues with VPNs and Netgear Routers? Any possible solutions I could try? 

Is there a way to get Windows 7 to automatically realize that my wireless printer has changed its IP address, and update accordingly? I have to change it manually every time and its annoying me. In all honesty, this doesn't happen very often, but my wife doesn't understand the problem, and she'll come upstairs and scream that the "printer is broken", then I have to stop what I'm doing, go downstairs and change the IP address. Its very annoying, and there must be a better way. Or, do have to handle this from the Router side and make sure my router always gives my printer the same IP? 

I subscribe to the Bloomberg on the Economy and Bloomberg Surveillance podcasts. Both of these podcasts tend to release multiple episodes at once, so my iTunes only gets the most recent episode when it starts up. Then when I connect my iPhone, I only get that most recent episode synced, when I'd really like to get all of the episodes. As such, I miss many of the episodes. The only way I can figure to solve the problem is to start iTunes each morning, then go into each podcast and select Get all to make sure I've got all the episodes, then reconnect my iPhone. There must be a better way. 

Whats the difference between the Intel Dual-Core(brand name) processor and the Core 2 Duo? It seems like clock speed is the only difference, but I want to make sure that is the case. It seems like anything over 2.6GHz is Core 2 Duo, and anything under 2.6GHz gets the label Dual-Core. 

Somehow I changed the default number of copies to print in Word. It's now set to 13, which is like some kind of booby trap for my household. I can change it ever time I print, but every now and then I forget to, and I get 13 copies of a Joel on Software article for reading on the train. How do I set the default number of copies? 

To create snippets for our documentation we generally take small pictures using the Windows snipping tool and then put them into Paint.Net to add some text to the image. The trouble is, if I paste an image into Paint.NET that now becomes the only area where I can add text/shapes/etc. For instance, if I create a new image that's size 800x600 I can draw anywhere in the image. I think paste in a screenshot of size 400x200. My original drawings are still visible, but I can no longer add anything outside of the 400x200 area of my pasted screenshot. I've tried pasting normally, and pasting as a new layer, but nothing works. The background layer cannot be edited outside of the 400x200 area after pasting in the image.
