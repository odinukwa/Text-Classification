You should be using underground electrical conduit. To answer your question about how big, it depends. On how many cables, of what diameter etc. Make sure you stay within 300 feet of total run length, or you won't pass a LAN cable test Here is a good site that shows you how to calculate how big to make your conduit. Make sure you leave room for expansion, bad wire replacement etc. AND a pull wire! 

If you setup each clients DNS so that it has an extra search domain (widget in your case) and the DNS server for that search domain is your DNS server, then it should work fine. This is the same thing most people do to internally resolve local machines in DNS, except that you are doing it across the Internet. The only issue I could see is that your ISP might block incoming port 53(DNS) traffic. 

It's possible that you had a secondary or tertiary MX record... If so, the mails will be on that server and you should be able to issue an ETRN command and have them sent to your current mail server. Do you have a copy of the DNS record before you switched the MX records so you can check that possibility? 

The issue is that your mail server is not generating the bounce. The receiving mail server is. It's up to the receiving mail server to include the message in the bounce. Most mail admins won't include the message because it just opens them up to being a backscatter relay. Your only option as I see it, would be to contact the mail admins for each user and ask them to include the message in the bounce if your domain is the source... 

Make sure that your clients are not using Rich Text for the email format. This is the default if you use Word as your email editor, but it can be switched to HTML format instead. Here is the Microsoft explanation for this. Here is the search on Microsoft support if you have other environments not covered in the first one. 

Another good tool is to create a qmailctl script (see section 2.8.2.1 from life with qmail link above). This will simplify most qmail management greatly. 

You will also need to check that the startup command for qmail-smtpd includes tcpserver, or the tcp filtering will not work. See these instructions (life with qmail) for further help on this, especially section 2.8.2.2. 

Yes, this is normal operation for ESX 3.x. Basically it (incorrectly I think) puts all the differential VMDKs on the same datastore as the .vmx file. For example, if you have a VM with a VMDK_1 file on DS1 and another VMDK_2 on DS2 and you create a snapshot, you will see two new files on DS1: 

We currently have an IBM DS4300 Dual Controller Fibre SAN. It is a good box, but getting pretty old. It came with 256MB of cache per controller. Recently we replaced the batteries in one of the controllers and noticed that the cache is a DDR PC2100 ECC DIMM. Of course, we are thinking about how cheap this RAM is now and is there any good reason we can't upgrade the RAM. IBM used to have a "Turbo" upgrade to this box that doubled the cache and had a bunch of software features for about 10K USD. Since that product has been end-of-lifed, I don't think we can get that upgrade and we don't need the software upgrades (FlashCopy, StorageCopy, etc). Besides the obvious potential warranty issue, what if any issues would we expect to see if attempting to put 2 - 1GB DIMMS in this unit? Any other things I am missing here? EDIT: Memory label: 

I loaded this is an telnet session so there was no refresh, but if your IP address is 67.210.98.60, then you are no longer redirecting people to a bad site. If your IP address is not 67.210.98.60, then your DNS has been hacked. Running an nslookup from here, I don't see that your nameserver is domaincontrol.com. Did you let your domain expire? I have seen a domain get parked when it expires. On another note, maybe these guys are at it again. You might call GoDaddy and double check. 

Check that your firewall is not blocking active ftp connections. WinSCP will default to using passive connections if it can't establish an active one, but the command line FTP can/will not. Unfortunately, if active FTP connections are not supported from endpoint to endpoint (I.e. someone's firewall is blocking it), then you are dead in the water with the command line FTP... 

If the domain in question is cadbury.com or cadburyschweppes.com, which is the PTR of the IP address in the logs...then no, the SPF records do not exist. You might want to look at not failing when there is no SPF record, only when the SPF record does not match the IP address you are talking to. Not every domain has an SPF record, and it is not a requirement for sending email... 

Login to the firewall Go to VPN -> Setttings Click the pencil next to the Tunnel in question Click the Advanced tab. Check the boxes next to the items you want to enable (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH) 

I am not sure that you will get a concise answer to this question... SpamAssassin can be configured by each mail admin differently, including adding new rules, changing the score for existing rules, changing the threshold for mail being marked as spam, etc. For example, we use a default score of 3.5 instead of the 5 that you are using. We also jack up the points for any emails that hit Pyzor, SORBS or any other blacklist database. Concerning diagnostics you can run: 

We had the same problem using the VSP instead of the built in Microsoft VSS. In the properties of the Master server -> Client Attributes, set the Snapshot Provider to "Use Microsoft Volume Shadow Copy Service..." That fixed it for us, as the settings were then controlled by the client OS, not NetBackup. 

Just in case someone finds this later, we were able to update the Cache memory without trouble. Noticed a huge improvement in speed (as expected), especially when writing files to the SAN. 

In our case, we created an internal CA and put any certs made by that CA as trusted. I.e. it was in the Trusted Root Certification Authority section. 

If your services spike often or you are developing on either "box", then I would virtualize and take the hit on performance in exchange for increased stability. 

Hardware firewalls as a general rule tend to be more reliable and faster. Since the manufacturer can choose/build the OS, they can make it very specific to supporting a firewall. Software firewalls don't have this luxury. They are dependent on the OS they are installed on. That being said, there are many good software firewalls. Some, like iptables, are even free. If you are looking to protect a medium to large business network, then IMO you should choose a hardware firewall. I think you hit the nail on the head with your question, it's really the same question: you get what you pay for. EDIT: Another thing that should matter to you is ICSA certification. There are about 20-25 hardware firewalls on this list and about 50 software firewalls, including personal firewalls. 

Have you checked your eventvwr logs? Do you have other Domain Controllers (DCs) in this domain? Which one is the Global Catalog (GC) FSMO? Try running 

To calculate this, take your IP address and do a bitwise AND with the subnet mask, then reverse the octets that aren't zero. i.e. 

Any chance to terminate the VPN in a DMZ instead on the LAN? If so, then you could punch a hole through the DMZ -> LAN on port 1433 to your SQL server. If it was me, I wouldn't want anyone whose computer is not maintained by my company on my company's network. Thus the reason for putting them in their own DMZ. What if they get a virus, or are part of a spambot network and start sending out spam across the VPN tunnel out your Internet connection. There are a lot of scary scenarios for a paranoid person. :-) 

One other thing to bring up: If you are going to use it as a database server, you will want to gauge how long your average query is going to be. If you get two long running queries, your database server is going to become unresponsive to the third query (even if it is just a simple single record request). We made this mistake on a database server and the users very quickly became very unhappy. Especially if you are using Stored Procedures with RBAR in them... After about a week, I placed an order for another dual core chip to fill the second socket. Our database runs our accounting package, which frequently runs queries that feed reports. Some of these queries hit tables with millions of records in them and take 15-30 seconds to run. If your load is different, you might be able to get away with one dual-core socket. 

Click the details next to the BL in question and it will tell you why you are on there and how to remove your self. EDIT: I see that you already know that you are on the UCE Protect... Most mail admins use clearing house BLs that query all of the known ones, like SORBS, UCE, spamhaus, etc. You would need to talk with AT&T to determine which ones they are using. I noticed that they have a form you can fill out to find out why you were blocked... EDIT2: Also, you should try adding your IP(s) to $URL$ Supposedly, this will get around the UCE2 and UCE3. rant As a side note, I don't blame you for being upset at AT&T using UCE2 or UCE3. The people that run that blacklist have a bad attitude that is hurting everyone. They seem to think that you can switch ISPs on a whim when they won't shutdown a spammer. This mentality is just not practical in the current age of spam botnets of millions of computers scattered around the globe. /rant 

I am assuming you have a barcode reader in that library... Have you checked to see if the Logical Media labels match the physical labels on the tapes? You can check this through the Netbackup Admin Console -> Media -> Volume Pools -> NetBackup and examine the MediaID vs. the Barcode. If they are different, then that's your problem. I would try relabeling the media in your NetBackup pool that it refuses to write to. Relabeling can be destructive, but if the tapes aren't being used, then I am guessing it's not much of an issue... EDIT: To clarify, I meant to logically relabel them to match the barcode, not physically. 

will give you more information than you ever cared to know about how spamassassin is grading your email message. Regarding rulesets: Here you can get instructions on making your own. These guys write some extra rules that work well. Since you are sending out SPAM (remember that SPAM is unsolicited email and promotions are no exception), it is very likely that after you start sending out emails that many of the SPAM databases are going to start flagging your emails as spammy. In fact, DCC and other auto-learning tools do exactly that. Your in-house test will score lower because your email is not in those databases yet, but after your email is in the wild, the scores will start to creep up as the databases catch up. 

Not sure on the StorageTeks, but on our Tandberg, we need to use Tandberg supplied utilities to get diagnostics from the robot. The built in Veritas diagnostics always fail... 

Might be just my ignorance of Exchange, but for our company, choosing an open platform was important so that we could modify the mail server to suit our needs. I think going with your initial suggestion and separating the two is the wise move. Imagine if one of your customers decides to start sending SPAM using your exchange server. You get added to an RBL and now your corporate email is treated as SPAM as well... I think that you want to choose an enterprise level linux, such as RHEL and pay for support! I am a personal fan of QMail running on linux because of its flexibility and security. 

What connection type are you using? If using Named pipes, try switching to TCP connections. We had similar problems with our 2005 server, and disabling Named pipes and forcing use of TCP connections took care of it for us. 

Are you doing anything in your login scripts that violates UAC? Try disabling UAC, and rebooting (this is necessary for the UAC change) and see if it still takes 10 minutes. Windows 7 does not show status of login scripts when the UAC fails and so you have no idea what is going on...at least that's been our experience. 

This can be real disaster if DS1 has very little extra storage and your VMDK_2 file is heavily used. We had a situation happen to us where the C: drive of a file server was on DS1 and the file sharing drive (F: in our case) was on DS2. A snapshot was taken during a VCB backup and ran for about a week before it was discovered. By the time it was discovered, DS1 was pretty much out of space and we almost lost a server while trying to consolidate the snapshot... it was a bad deal. So you want to make sure the Datastore with your .vmx file on it has enough room to save the snapshot .vmdk files. 

On the Restore database dialog, there is a setting: and the default is . So your restore operation should be restoring only the most recent backup. Here is some more information from MSDN on this. Since a full backup includes the Transaction log, it could make sense to include two full backups. The first one could be used for the initial restore and then only the transaction log from the second full backup could be used to update the incremental changes from there. Another reason could be if the transaction log was truncated after the first backup was performed and your .MDF file was corrupted in the meantime. At that point you might want the MDF from the first full and only the transaction log from the second full. 

As long as you permanently delete your messages (delete them from Deleted Items), Outlook Express will login in to the POP3 server and delete those messages. Another one I like to use is the other check box on that page that says: "Remove from server after X days" Set X to whatever makes sense for you. In your case, I would set it to however long it takes you to read the 1000's of messages per day. Regarding IMAP, it will work better for Synchronizing your messages, but you will notice that it requires a good solid connection to the Internet. Even though there is a local copy of the mailbox on your machine, it still trys to check into the server a lot to see if it needs to change things. This will make OE slow down noticeably. Also, depending on how big these messages are, Rocketmail is going to limit how many messages you can keep since IMAP stores the messages on their server. The other thing annoying about IMAP is you can't change the pre-defined folders and you can't subfolder under those pre-defined folders. Hard to explain here, unless you try for yourself.

You don't want to do this or your windows updates and any other software installation needing a reboot to finish installation will fail. We tried something similar and regretted it... I would recommend that you create a .bat file that you train your users to run after they boot up and before they open any files/programs... You could start with: 

I think you are going to need to configure your broadcom driver differently. You should have two separate "virtual" network cards and then the physical network card on the 2008 server. Each virtual should have it's own VLAN configured. This will happen automatically once you configure the broadcom driver to have two VLANs. A reboot will be required after this (at least on my Win7 machine it was). The physical network card is really not used by the OS anymore, the virtuals are. After you set this up, then bind your DHCP scopes to the appropriate "virtual" network card based on the VLAN desired for each scope and you shouldn't have anymore problems. 

and check the output for problems, especially with the SYSVOL and/or replication with other DCs. THIS CAN BE DANGEROUS: If this is not the only DC in the directory, and the event logs don't reveal anything, try making a copy of the sysvol\domain\policies and place it elsewhere on the hard drive of the server. Make sure you do this during off hours and make sure you perform a complete AD backup using:
