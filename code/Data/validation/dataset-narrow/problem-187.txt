We upgraded from 20 Mbps to 50 Mbps DIA about two months ago. This required a router upgrade as well. Since then, anyone who starts a large HTTP download - e.g. an ISO, large spreadsheet or log, movie file, etc. - can take all of the available bandwidth and block others from accessing the internet. The old router didn't have any kind of QoS configured on it. Further, it was a very vanilla config. It simply had some named ints, the security levels of each, and the IP addresses associated with each int. The ISP supplied the new router and we don't have access to view the config, but they said they don't have any kind of QoS configured on it either. My questions are: 

I'm auditing switch interface descriptions at work. I work nights and sometimes people during the day shut down their computers when they leave, so I don't see which computers are on interfaces when I'm not there. I have a mix of Cisco 3500 and 3600 series switches where it's possible to use curl (then some grep statements) 

to get the running config, MAC address table, interface descriptions, etc. I'm using this to generate reports of MAC address tables and int descriptions when I'm not at work so I can audit switch interfaces to see what phones and PCs are online when I'm not in. I have MAC addresses documented from machines when they are unboxed, so I can compare the MACs I have with the ones reported in the automated curl statements. This will also be used to see if anyone's violating the "Don't BYOD" policy. This has worked flawlessly with the 3500s, 3550s, 3560s, and 3650s I have. I also have some sg300s that don't appear to be able to do that. Is that an accurate assumption? 

We noticed DDoS attack on our network and we have firewall blocking attack at the same time we notice in it's filling all connection, we have 600k limit. we don't have enabled on this ASA so how to find out who was targeted host? Any method or command which can find DDoS targeted IP or top-talker? 

We have with and it seems strange on our SNMP monitoring its showing Max CPU utilization 70% and avg 35% but when i check on command line numbers are totally different, what is the best command to check CPU utilization on Cisco which give correct info. We are pumping 4Gbps on this router and running BGP with bunch of ACL and netflow. I want to see who is eating most CPU (i believe it must be ACL but just want to see how much?) 

Nexus 3064 CPU spike and packetloss I have L3 Cisco 3064PQ switch which is running latest "nxos.7.0.3.I4.7.bin" basically I am using for routing so my ISP 2x10Gbps link terminated (with LACP) on single switch (without STP,vPC) it and currently live traffic is 10Gbps on switch but i have notice periodic packetloss and not sure where its coming from, after digging i found when my CPU spike up to 70% i have seeing packet loss. If you notice in below picture that 60% spike and at same time i have noticed 1 ping packet loss. How do i debug this issue and find out what is that pike for and why its happening periodically 

I install certificates so infrequently that I do this all the time and I never bother trying to restore it. It's trivial to just re-do the CSR and request another cert. Most SSL cert providers will give you unlimited re-keys and even if its an EV certificate they'll re-issue the certificate within minutes. You'll probably save a lot of time by just starting from the beginning. 

This is a limitation with packet tracer it seems. I quickly replicated your set up in PT 7.0 with no luck. If you put a server on a new switchport, put the port on the correct vlan and mark that port as trusted DHCP will work fine. I think if you did this with real kit it would work fine. 

I'm not sure that's a loop. I'm not really sure what that is. The ACL looks fine so you probably want to talk to HP about this. I had a case similar to this where a procurve based L3 switch would not manage its arp table properly. I think it was on the same software branch as you too. Called HP and 5 minutes later it was confirmed as a known issue and due to be fixed in next release. If you check the release notes for the next firmware version does it mention anything about ARP being fixed? Or is it listed as a known issue in the current firmware release notes (firmware release you're running now). The next morning it happens, try clearing the arp table/cache with clear arp. Try to ping from vlan 120 to a server again and see if it works. I think the firmware versions are free from HP (at least on the lower end models). We were looking at the 5400 to use at the core and ended up going with a Comware based HP switch instead and its been solid. Procurve is great (we have customers using a lot of them at the access layer) but I've seen odd issues like this crop up, especially on the newer firmware versions. 

Look like DNS/HTTP isn't working. I have check and NAT is correctly configured. I am suspecting it could be DNS/HTTP inspection policy? but its default i never change it anything. 

If you see following diagram we have two separate links (10G) coming from same ISP terminated on router where we are planning to run BGP. From ASR 1006 two 10G fiber terminated to switch. Notes: I know BGP doesn't make sense with single ISP but in future we have plan to get second ISP but for now we have only single ISP. Question: 

Update: Someone suggested run BGP on Internet connectivity but use OSPF for internal routing between Router <---> L3 switch as per above diagram if i plan to configure OSPF between Router and L3 switch then what network i will advertise on OSPF command? Example: ISP provided 10.1.1.0/24 subnet to us how do i configure BGP and OSPF for internal network? Any suggestion? 

But in Nexus switch i am not seeing any command or related doc, how do i announce my subnet in ospf in nx-os My nexus 9k config 

I download IOS from Cisco TAC and trying to load on ASR1006 but getting following error. I have compared bytes and they are same on cisco TAC. On Cisco TAC they have & but i am not seeing any How do i validate its correct image? 

I have this scenario where i have two 10G link from my and both link has two class C public IP which is mentioned in diagram. I want to router data between two VRF & 

Why when we had 20 Mbps service did we not have this problem where any one user could monopolize all the bandwidth to the internet? Am I correct in thinking that Quality of Service configurations would prevent this or does QoS simply identify which traffic has priority over another, and does nothing for competing traffic of the same type? If it's the latter, and my vocabulary is wrong, what statements do I need to configure and where (we have a Cisco 4507 core switch, a Cisco Pix on the primary ISP, a Cisco ASA on the backup ISP, and the inaccessible ISP router is a Cisco 2911) so that no one user can take all the available bandwidth to our internet connection? 

We had a broadcast storm that went undiagnosed for several hours. After the problem switch was unplugged and traffic returned to normal, we had a handful of machines and switches that were broken. On one switch, the sole uplink interface had to be moved to another int. On another, one of the two etherchannel physical members is down. One machine has a SSD and it didn't boot up after it was shut down. BIOS says it's a 32 KB disk. At least one other server's fans would ramp up to high RPMs every couple of minutes. I read that storm traffic not intended for a machine is dropped by the NIC, but broadcast traffic is sent up the network stack and can cause high CPU utilization. I imagine if the OS was writing log files because of the increased network activity it could eventually fill up disk space and/or burn up an SSD because of the increased read/writes. 

We have a scenario where a customer is having a managed L3VPN installed and would like to run OSPF internally. The issue is that the provider will not allow us to provide and manage the CE device and they will only use BGP as the CE-PE protocol. They've told us that we can run OSPF internally and form a neighbourship between our L3 switch and their managed CE. They will then redistribute the routes into BGP and in turn, advertise those routes to their PE. That doesn't seem like a valid design to me. That means at each site we'll need to run an instance of OSPF in area 0 and as far as OSPF is concerned every site will be a different autonomous system, right? Due to the BGP in the middle (between managed CE - PE) the routes will be external OSPF routes and we wont be able to connect our area 0's together. I think it will work for now but I imagine it will cause headaches in future if we try to scale or make the solution slightly more complicated. I think if we ever decided to have a backup leased line or VPN tunnel the LSA's would be type 2 and therefor a preferred path than the external routes caused by type 5 LSAs. I know OSPF as a CE-PE protocol is valid and would essentially address all the concerns above but I think that option is probably off the table. Are there any caveats/concerns with the solution above? Should we be pushing harder for the provider to run OSPF as the CE-PE protocol? 

We have IPsec tunnel which is working but somehow getting drop and reconnect itself and that causing disturbance in application, i am unable to find root cause. I have check and map setting both side also key lifetime too. This is what i am seeing when i continue run following command. 

We had DDoS couple days ago and following is netflow data but i am confused with numbers which i am seeing here. If you look at first column so it's in GB what does this means? I have checked network interface graph and i am seeing only spike in link. 

EDIT I am pinging my peer public address and packet loss there so its not Internet issue. I am clearly seeing my tunnel getting drop and after 2 packet drop its back itself, Is there anyway i can find reason for dropping tunnel or logs? We have many tunnel to remote site and they all working fine except this one. I am continuing ping to remote LAN IP and intermediately seeing packet drop and same time i notice tunnel down, and after few packet missing in ping it back itself. If you notice my output, i am notice this 

I want to send A/24 to ISP1 and B/24 to ISP2 so should i use or better just configure on related interface, what would be best option? 

we have 10G fiber running since 1 year but today i have migrate that same link to ASR1006 and i am seeing following error, what could be the wrong? 

On IOS/IOS-XE you can use either reflexive ACL's or use stateful inspection with Cisco Context Based Access Control (CBAC) or Zone Based Firewall (ZBF). ZBF is the current way to do stateful inspection. It works by creating zones and applying the zones to interfaces. Then you create a class-map to identify traffic and use a policy map to inspect the traffic that you identified in the class map. You then create a 'Zone Pair' in which you define a traffic flow (inside to outside) and apply the policy map to that pair. IOS will then perform stateful inspection on that traffic like any other firewall. Documentation for ZBF on IOS XE is here: $URL$ 

Looking at your question it looks like you're confusing DHCP and routing. To be clear, they both accomplish different tasks and really have nothing to do with each other. DHCP is a way to dynamically assign IPs to clients. Routing allows you to get from one network to another. To answer your question.. There are really two ways in which your computer will know there is a router on the network. Either because you have manually assigned an IP address/subnet mask with a default gateway (default gateway being the router), or because the computer has been set to request an IP via DHCP and within the DHCP offer it received from the server it contained a default gateway for the client to use. The client will not attempt any communication with a router until it has an IP address and default gateway configured (again manually or via dhcp). The computer will then look at its own IP address and subnet mask to determine if the IP address it is trying to communicate with is on its local network. If it is then it will attempt to send the data straight to the device and if it is not then it will look at its configured default gateway (router) and send it there. The router will then send the traffic to the destination because it has a route, or to another router that might know where the destination network exists.
