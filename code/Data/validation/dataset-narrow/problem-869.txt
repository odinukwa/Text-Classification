I'm specifically NOT looking for instructions for any given mail server, such as Exchange or Postfix. But it's okay to say: “you should have X and Y in your set-up, because when talking to server software Z, it typically tries to weed out open relays by checking for these.” 

We have a single public subnet, with a BGP router as the primary gateway. Now I'm interested in configuring a second router for redundancy. How do I deal with multiple gateways on the servers in our public subnet? I found some other questions related to multiple gateways that seem to deal with NAT set-ups. In my situation, the servers all have public routed IP-addresses. So from what I can tell, it doesn't really matter which route incoming or outgoing packets take. But I figure the servers need some way of telling when one of the gateways is down, and route around it? Is this accomplished with protocols such as OSPF? And do I need to deploy this on all my servers? 

I'm faced with the task of setting up a public-internet-facing email server, that will be relaying mail for all of our other servers in the network. While the software in itself is set up in few keystrokes, what little experience I have with managing an email server has thought me that there are tons of awkward filtering techniques employed by other email systems. Systems that my own server will inevitably interact with a some point. Hence, my questions: 

I managed to solve this by having sign the files. For reference, this is done with the option in , and is documented in the manpage. 

If you are using addresses other than (or ), then you may need specific rules. But if so, perhaps you can explain the reason why you are using such addresses, because your problem domain may very well end up matching your network domain. (Or at least make you consider other options.) 

You can set up a reverse proxy to serve at port 80, and forward all requests to 8080. Apache is one of the web servers that can do this for you. There is a basic reverse proxying example in the mod_proxy documentation. 

Remote machine is A Your cloud server is B Your desktop/laptop is C A initiates a SSH session w/ reverse tunnel to B. This opens a port on B's localhost, pointing back to port 22 on machine A. All traffic travels over this tunnel. Check the -R option to the ssh client. From C you ssh into B, then ssh to the port on the localhost that is the B end of the SSH tunnel that A initiated. 

I don't collect form info, etc. on my sites, but I do want everything to run HTTPS so I set up vhost configs to redirect non-HTTPS requests to the HTTPS side, with a non-named catch-all that redirects to example1.com - 

You can do this on the webserver level using (name based) virtual hosts. Set DNS for both names to the same IP. Configure apache with 2 (name based) virtual hosts. domain1 has a document root of and contains some directories, including one named /download - so the file system path to that folder is Set up domain2 so that its document root is What domain1 sees as $URL$ domain2 will serve up at $URL$ Another lazy way is to use symbolic links, if you tell the webserver to follow them. You can also alias various directories, so if you install phpMyAdmin it can be available on $URL$ but the files all live in /usr/lib/phpMyAdmin and that directory is simply aliased in. 

Depending on how the client is configured, it may or may not send the hostname when it makes a DHCP request. But, as the example shows, you can access it via the MAC address. On my own home set up, I use the hostname field in the dhcpd.conf so I know which machine it is (livingroom-tv, my-desktop, wifes-iphone, etc) and depend on the MAC address option to determine which machine is actually getting that particular IP. DNS is handled separately with a fake domain (my.house) because only a few machines actually need DNS entries (for me/my convenience) and is not integrated in any way with DHCP. Almost all of my static-dynamic MAC address based IPs are given out to control access - I have a VERY short lease time, and when the kids need to be blocked from access, I simply change their default gateway or point them at a second DNS server that restricts where they can go/what they can do (ie, on their phone facebook.com may say "you should be doing homework!" :) ) 

The company I work for recently got hands on a batch of second hand PowerEdge SC1425 machines. We'd like to put these to good use. Our operating system of choice is Ubuntu Server 10.04 64-bit, which installs just peachy on this type of machine. Now I'd like to install the firmware updates from Dell, which are apparently marked as recommended. This includes the updates for the BIOS, the BMC, and possibly some other hardware. I find it incredibly difficult to locate the files on the Dell website, and install any of them on an Ubuntu system: 

The username will be available in the environment variable . This works for nearly every authentication method, should you ever start using digest or maybe even kerberos authentication. 

The and table concern the local machine itself receiving and sending packets respectively, no matter which interface or address is involved. You probably want a rule that accepts everything received from interface in , and accepts everything sent on interface in . In plain iptables: 

We have a small network of servers for which DNS service is critical. However, it seems to be a pain to set up redundant DNS service. What we currently have is two caching/forward resolving servers set up running Ubuntu with Unbound. With the standard set-up, it seems the best we can do is configure a very short timeout. I'm finding very little help with Google. The solution that seems to be most common is to create a virtual IP or set up heartbeat. But I'm not sure that'd work in our case, because the forwarding servers are in separate subnets and physical locations. Regardless, I'm wondering: 

I work for a service provider, and we've suffered an attack. We've learned from it, but nonetheless it has cost us. The good thing is we have pcap traces of the event, and IP addresses. Now my question is, how does one send a good abuse mail to the other provider? The situation complicates, because there is money involved, and the other provider is a regular ISP serving private people, in another country. We'd love to see our money back, but has anyone ever succeeded at doing that? 

When you find out if the space that can be reclaimed is substantial, you are ready for the next step, running Optimization Jobs: In Windows Server 2012 Data Deduplication, Optimzation Jobs perform the work of deduplicating data and optimizing a volume. These jobs can be run on-demand (manually) or on a scheduled basis. You can trigger an optimization job on-demand in Windows PowerShell by using the Start-DedupJob cmdlet. For example: 

You can give selective DNS responses based on location with BIND Views if you are using BIND as your external DNS server. The Technical Preview of the new version of Windows Server also has a feature called DNS Policies which looks very promising. To serve content based on client location and other criteria such as User Agent or schedules, F5 has an appliance called Global Traffic Manager which used in conjuntion with their load balancers achieves what you are looking for. In Cloud environments, Amazon's Route 53 can accomplish the same. In order to keep the data in sync you must have a storage backend capable of do synchoronous replication, or use the replication provided by MySQL, which will keep the replicated data consistent. 

You can accomplish this by editing the registry. In , create a DWORD entry called and set the value to . Also, you can use the URLRewrite module or install URLScan, more about this in the following article: $URL$ 

The article that you pointed out does not necessarily apply only to domain environments. As noted at the end: 

If the virtual machine is not registered on the ESX host and you want to search its configuration file, run this command and press Enter: 

You can use the real time monitor and filter to match your desired interface to view how much bandwidth is using that interface, and which applications are using that bandwidth. 

How Much Disk Space Can I Expect to Reclaim? When you install the Data Deduplication role service on a server running Windows Server 2012, DDPEVAL.EXE is also installed in the C:\Windows\System32 folder as an additional command-line tool. DDPEVAL.EXE can be run against any local NTFS volumes or NTFS network shares to estimate the amount of disk space that can potentially be reclaimed by moving that data to a Windows Server 2012 NTFS volume with Data Deduplication enabled. 

First you'll need to turn your USB filesystem(s) into a bootable ISO image. Remastersys may do this for you... it can clone a running system as configured. Once you have the ISO image, you'll need to set up a PXE boot system using a TFTP server, DHCP server with some options, etc. 

The "milter service" is a pass-off from Postfix to run messages through an anti-spam (spamassassin) or anti-virus (amavis, etc) scanner before sending out and/or delivering to Dovecot/etc. to be sent ot a users in-box. That "can't connect" message means that your milter service is either not running or it isn't running on the port that you've specified. Check in your to see exactly what the milter service is supposed to be providing, and then look at the configuration for that thing. Or just post your file (properly formatted please) 

By not having a valid shell, the system default umask isn't being applied/used. What you can do is put your users in a group, and force a few things via the file, including a umask - 

Then enable SSL in apache - - and then restart apache2. The output of you show looks like it is correct - if you (re)start apache2 does it show as listening if you look via ? 

What is more important than a FQDN is the server has a sense of self-identity and it can confirm it. So should have a simple hostname in there (I have multiple linode machines, so I use node1, node2, etc). That same name should have a pointer to 127.0.0.1 or 127.0.1.1 in You'll need a real DNS-level FQDN if you want to use DNS to access your box, get SSL certs, etc. Good thing is linode GIVES you a FQDN - in the form of liNN-NNN.members.linode.com where the Ns are numbers (and may be more of them). You can see it in your control panel under "remote access" or contact the support folk. If you start configuring services - mail, http/https, etc - then each service will have a config file (or files) and you can specify in that what hostname/FQDN to respond to. As long as DNS is pointing that hostname/FQDN to your IP, stuff will work. Depending on what you do with your machine - for example, if you set up a mail server it MIGHT pull your hostname, etc. in to create its own config on initial install.
