Although this is dependent on your motherboard, say if SATA port 0 has a different operating mode than SATA port 1 (or whatever ports you have them connected to) there would be a difference, but most likely they are all the same type and speed and the actual location the drive is connected to on the motherboard will not affect performance. However, in your case there is a significant difference, your motherboard, an MSI Z77MA-G45, does indeed have different speed ports, it has two SATA-III (6Gbps) and four SATA-II (3Gbps) ports. SATA1 and SATA2 are 6Gbps ports and SATA3-6 are are 3Gbps ports. On page 1-22 of your owners manual, it clearly shows the different ports and speeds. It would usually be advisable to have your boot device on SATA1 (the first port) and then the drive you want the fastest access to besides the boot drive to be connected to SATA2 as those are SATA-III ports (assuming you have SATA-III drives), after that drives could be connected to any port. Optical drives do not need to be connected to SATA-III ports as most do only support SATA-II anyway. The startup speed in this case could very well be related to which port the hard disk is connected to, but would require more information to diagnose (that wasn't really the point of your question). 

I don't know why any SATA SSD drive would NOT work since this laptop has a standard SATA interface. According to Crucial, all their SATA SSD drives are compatible and this should be a fairly good representation of all manufacturer's industry standard SATA SSD drives. You should not have any compatible issues with standard SSD drives in this device, regardless of size. 

Download the latest Windows 10 ISO image, mount it a new VM and install like normal. $URL$ Windows 10 will function indefinitely in a limited manner, but for most things it will work fine, I have been running the same VM install for almost a year with no issues, I just can't change the background. 

You didn't state your distro, but this should work for most of them that use YUM. The proper package names are the same for yum or apt... it is: or or Assuming you have enabled Google Chrome's repository, here is an example. 

Even if the embedded graphics do not work, your graphics card should work fine. PCI-E is fully backwards compatible, so your 2.1 video card will function just fine in a 2.0 slot. 

In previous versions of Windows we could install the Intel Advanced network drivers in our notebooks to connect to specific VLANs via the embedded Ethernet adapter. In Windows 10, the option is not available and there is a message that says: 

150Mbps is the maximum theoretical speed, but that is not really achievable in the real world ... 40-50Mbps is typical on Wireless N assuming both devices are connected at the optimum settings with Wireless N, you did not state your laptop's connection. Also remember that WiFi is a half-duplex protocol, essentially cutting that in half or even a quarter if you going laptop to router to phone and back. Your numbers do seem a bit low, but you did not give any additional information to give an answer on. $URL$ 

This is a BIOS/UEFI issue... HP, like many other mainstream manufacturers, use locks in the BIOS to prevent the use of unapproved or unauthorized hardware in their laptops, typically about WiFi, Bluetooth, and 3G/4G data modems, called a whitelist. The reasoning for this is it may cause "undesired functionality or other issues" but in reality it is just forcing you to purchase accessories from them directly. The difficult part is to find out exactly what is on this list because manufacturers are seldom willing to hand out this information. To change your wireless card you have two options, first is to update the BIOS with one modified to allow ANY WiFi or Bluetooth adapter, a good place to start looking for information on this would be here. Second, would be to change the card/module to one that better fits your needs that was offered by the manufacturer as an option on your laptop (see more below). If your device has UEFI, it gets much more complicated because most UEFI have a security measure which prevents flashing a modded UEFI. Luckily for you, HP is one of the few manufacturers who freely distributes their service and technical manuals, which also include a list, with part numbers, of all parts that were available for a device. The HP Mini 110 and Compaq Mini CQ10 - Maintenance and Service Guide clearly lists 2 or 3 different network cards were available in your device: Ralink RT-3090 802.11b/g/n WiFi Adapter module Atheros 9285G 802.11b/g/n 1Ã—1 WiFi Adapter module Broadcom 4312G 802.11b/g WiFi Adapter module If you examine the manual and find the part number listings for WLAN starting on about page 28 of the document listed above, you will see lots of part numbers for varying parts of the world. You will have to find your country, then search the internet for the part number to see the exact chipset information for each part. For the most part, these parts can be purchased on eBay or similar site at a relatively low price. Going to any adapter outside of what is listed in the maintenance and service guide is risky at best. 

Your monitor supports a maximum resolution of 1920x1080, your new graphics supports a maximum resolution of 2560x1600... The new graphics card should detect the monitors maximum capabilities and only display in a maximum of 1920x1080, in Windows you will likely not even be able to select a higher resolution, doing so will cause the monitor to not display an image and could possibly damage the monitor. With your current monitor, the highest resolution it can display is 1920x1080, so to answer your question directly: No, it will not support 2560x1600 regardless of the graphics card. 

Seeing this parameter at a near zero value is normal, provided it does not increase over time, which is an indication of degrading hardware and imminent failure. Regardless of the results of self-testing or other information, this drive should be replaced as soon as possible to prevent catastrophic data loss. Personally, if this value in excess of 20 (not 20k or 200k, but 20) or increasing, I implement backup and hardware replacement procedures as soon as possible. A quick check of a few drives on some computers on our test bench indicate all have their values are 0, except one laptop which at 8, but it's 2 year history indicates only one reallocation event about 15 months ago. 

You claim to have a background in networking but do not understand these simple concepts? 1) Depending on your T&C with you ISP, you are most likely just paying for a "pipe" to the public internet, restricted to a set maximum speed limit or data volume limit without a guaranteed level of service. 2) See below explaining proxy 3) Your ISP likely doesn't have "servers" on the internet, but routers and switches connecting to a bigger upstream pipe. All of your data will always go through them as there is no other physical or logical path for the data to take. 4) You can't, without physical control of the devices there is no way of knowing. Although if your proxy service supports a VPN connection, the data will likely be encrypted so that even if it is spied on it would be useless to the person looking at it. In this case, proxy service essentially submits all requests to/from the internet on your behalf and it to the far end it appears to be talking to your proxy service and not you directly, the physical and logical connections of your ISP are still used. Normal interaction with Google.com, simplified for example: Your web browser -> ISP network -> Internet Cloud -> Google (path back is just reversed) But when a proxy service is in use, it looks more like two separate transations like this (again, simplified): 1) Your web browser -> ISP network -> Internet Cloud -> Proxy server (STOP) 2) Proxy Server initiates new request -> Internet Cloud -> Google (path back is reversed in two distinct steps as well) The proxy server becomes your agent... Imagine you wanted to buy something at the store, you have two choices to buy the product, you can either buy the product yourself or send Proxy to do it for you. If you buy it yourself, the store knows some information about you such as what you look like and maybe how often you come into the store. But if you have Proxy go buy it for you, the store doesn't know you or anything about you, just that Proxy comes in buys a product, and probably a bunch of other products too. Make sense? All of the above is talking about a "web proxy", but some proxy services use a VPN to connect to their proxy server, this is kind of the same thing, but still different. In this case all of your data (not just web traffic) is sent over an encrypted tunnel to your proxy service before going out to the internet, the information still flows through your ISP's network but it is an encrypted tunnel of data. 

That power supply is actually rated at 420w peak, 350w continuous output and two 15A +12v rails (30A rating), it should be sufficient to run this rig (assuming you have mentioned everything, but I assumed two 120mm fans as well), and you can get an adapter online for a reasonable cost like this one. For that matter, most video cards will function fine with the 6-pin connector plugged in because the 2 missing pins are just ground connections, although this is very much NOT a recommended solution. From your information, entered into a Power Supply calculator, this rig would require just under 300w power with an 18A draw on the +12v rail. That said, upgrading to a modern 500 watt power supply would probably be the best choice given the age of unit to guarantee trouble free power the system. 

Your computer is fairly new, why would you think it wouldn't work? As long as the interface is the same (most all laptop computers in the last 6+ years use a SATA interface) the likely hood you will run into a BIOS/UEFI limit on HD size in modern computers is near zero. That being said, any drive up to 2.2TB should be a drop in replacement with no changes to the system, just reinstall or us a utility like Macrium Reflect to move your data and resize the partitions all in one operation, and away you go. If you are moving to larger volume sizes like a 4TB drive, you will have to use GUID/GPT style partitioning which could pose a few differences, but since you are looking at a 2TB drive this shouldn't be an issue. 

Adding a reset button is a simple matter, provided your motherboard has pins or other connection for a reset button. Most retail motherboards (Asus, Gigabyte, MSI) have them but many OEM (HP, Dell, Lenovo, etc) boards do not. If your does, a simple momentary contact NO (normally open) push button switch connected to the reset button connector on the motherboard will suffice. The switches are available at most electronics component stores (Frye's, MicroCenter) and can be easily mounted by drilling the required size hole in a blank drive bay insert, although mounting in a spot with sufficient space behind it in the front of the case would work as well. 

To directly answer your question, No, newer cards are not less compatible. You may find a few pieces of older equipment that have an issue with the speed of the newer cards, but I think that would be more the exception than the rule. That being said, there are several other factors that would need to be considered using newer cards in older devices including capacity, format, etc. 

To give you a blunt answer, no, you do not have to... you do not have to do anything as long as the applications work, but that isn't always the best course of action. You SHOULD apply any security or critical updates at least, these are intended to fix security issues or exploits that are known. Regardless of how you lock down your system via Kiosk mode or close ports in the firewall these pose a potential risk. That is why these things are called exploits or security holes, they could, potentially, give an attacker an exploit into your machine that is not a normal way of access that is closed off through your mentioned methods. 

Although your question is quite vague, I believe you are saying you have a Beetel 450TC1 ADSL Modem/Router and have switched from ADSL service to a broadband service that gives you a standard Ethernet connection for Internet access? You should get a different router, one that is a real wireless router and not a ADSL Modem/Router combination. ADSL Modem/Routers in general have no provisions for external Internet access, such as from your new broadband connection, it expects the only Internet access to come from the ADSL connection (which you no longer have). It is likely not possible to make it work as a "standard" WiFi router, especially given it doesn't have the correct interface. Your best course of action would be to acquire a standard wireless router. Given that you do have a USB dongle, and I assume your computer has a wired Ethernet connection, it is possible you would use Internet Connection sharing (Hotspot), but that would depend on your operating system and setting it up is outside of the scope of these answer, but there are multiple tutorials online for most operating systems that are capable of it.
