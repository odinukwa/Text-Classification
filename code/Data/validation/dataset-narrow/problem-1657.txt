The lost pings are not a uniform distribution over a time period. They stop for many seconds and then go on. This is a typical example with lost pings between and : 

As @Milliways commented here is where the power of comes to play. There is no need to wait that sequential processed commands are finished. is working parallel (that is what it makes a bit unfamiliar). It can start services after other services are started. Because this "network-up thing" is a very common problem, we have a nice service for it named . Now it is very simple to start after . Let's do it with as template. You can replace it with . I use Raspbian Lite from . Create and test it: 

At this time I only have Raspberry Pi 3 for testing but oldoldstable raspbian does not run on a RPi3 out of the box. We have to use an updated version. Thanks to who made an updated raspbian wheezy for RPi3. Therefore we have to take this test with caution. I downloaded and flashed it, made , rebooted and tested. The result was very stable but not 100 %. From 106000 packets transmitted I got 2419 packet loss. jessie lite is the successor of and the changeover to . I installed latest version of 2019-07-05-raspbian-jessie-lite (for me: added in , deleted in ). Ping-test after warm-up without packet loss. Then updated the installation: 

You have made the assumption that 24 clocks are required. A quick look at the datasheet suggests 18 clocks are required per cycle. This gives a figure of The faulty assumption is that all devices require transfers in multiples of 8 bits. 

No harm in using a capacitor. Connect one between each gpio you are reading and a ground pin. As close as possible to the gpio's pin. Similarly no harm in using your own 10K resistor instead of the built-in (50K) resistor. The lower value will give better protection against interference on long wiring. That said, a bounce-time of 350 ms should be more than sufficient to squash any spikes, so there is something odd going on. 

It updates the repositories indexes (update) and then upgrades (upgrade and dist-upgrade) all the packages. Finally it gets rid of any newly orphaned packages. It ensures I'm up to date with the Raspbian and raspberrypi.org repositories. EDITED TO ADD is normally in the program path so the script can be run by simply typing . However the script must first have been made executable with the command 

As written in the first line of it is generated by resolvconf. If you want to set a static domain name server you have to uncomment in the line: 

Raspian is distributed with disk-images containing all the same Disk identifer, so we spread the same identifer for different storages all over the world. Doesn't matter? No, we get problems as reported here. Disk management tools like or correct this silently to a unique Disk identifier when used. But then Raspbian fails to boot because it has it's old and now wrong numerated Disk identifer in it's root parameter. In the opposite it seems that the UUID of a partition never changes as long as the partition exists, even with duplicates on different disks. It's unique on the disk. 

I haven't told that I use multicast streaming in my home network with a configurable smart switch that can handle this. Most ethernet ports belong to a multicast VLAN with enabled so clients can easily drop in a port and look TV, e.g. with . I've looked at the problem with because this produced clear instability. Stripping down the problem step by step I come to look with during ping test and raspi direct connected to the switch. I saw that there are pauses in when sends an (don't know why this is send). Here is a typical trace (192.168.10.121 address of the raspi): 

It can not be done. When power is applied the Pi will boot. The boot process takes several seconds. As part of the boot process the operating system (normally Linux) is launched. You can only run a Python script once the operating system has launched. Depending on the Pi model this will be, say, 10-30 seconds after power has been applied. 

You don't need anything fancy. You could just use a ULN2003A to supply power to the LEDs and apply PWM to its inputs to control the brightness. The maximum brightness should be set with an appropriate value for the LED current limiting resistor. This video shows the Pi generating PWM to control the brightness of LEDs connected to a ULN2003A. The persistence effect is generated by varying the PWM level. 

I do not see why that pigpio code would be affected by PWM. It would be affected by the system being busy - just like any other code would be. For any serious timing purposes with pigpio you should be using callbacks. The callback will tell you when the GPIO changed state accurate to a few microseconds - regardless of the busyness of the system. $URL$ is an example of using callbacks with the pigpio daemon. The following is an example of the sort of thing to do using the library directly. In this example the callback function is called sonarEcho, which simply times the difference between the echo going high then low. 

If you get your application running start it with an optimized service for . is starting services parallel so with smart selected dependencies and starting just needed services you should be able to start your application as fast as possible. Here I have made a simple test service in an other context but it may give you an idea how it works. 

Your adapter has a self-assigned ip address . So it is very likely that your raspi with followed apples and has also a self-assigned ip address from the address range . With this your raspi has also got the name on the subnet. Try to 

troubleshooting works without . as firewall only restricts communication so for troubleshooting make sure is complete transparent. If you have some rules there then save them (out of scope here) before flushing [1]: 

There are some quirks with adding a third partition to the Raspbian image. First it will expand its root partition on first boot to the whole SD card so you cannot simply add a partition afterwards. Second is that using a disk partitioner like (I prefer ) it will silently modify the to a unique id. Because Raspbian uses the in and in to address partitions, it will fail booting then. For further information look at [1]. So we have to expand the root partition to 3 GB, add the third partition and modify and before the first boot. For addressing the partitions we use . Let's do it. First flash an image, assuming the SD card is at . For reference I use Raspbian Stretch Lite 2018-04-18. 

The Pi has no analogue inputs so you will need to buy an ADC (e.g. MCP3202) to read the voltage. That will convert the analogue voltage to a value which can be read by the Pi (in the case of the MCP3202 the value would be in the range 0-4095 and the SPI interface would be used). A problem is that you need a stable reference voltage. The Pi's 5V line is unregulated so you would probably have to use the Pi's regulated 3V3 line. In that case you will only be able to measure voltages in the 0-3.3V range. Given that your battery is probably greater than 6V when fully charged you will need to use a voltage divider (perhaps a pair of resistors) to drop the voltage to the 0-3.3V range. 

A BO motor (as far as I can tell from Google) is a DC motor. A DC motor requires a motor driver. You need a motor driver board or you need to create your own motor driver from discrete components. 

And you should get responses out from the internet, e.g. from the google nameserver. First try from the raspi then from the phone: 

Could it be that most people use wifi and therefore this failure is not detected? I've searched for notes to my problem and have found some questions with similar problems and no one has a solution. Raspberry Pi Ethernet connection ethernet internet connection stopped working RaspBerry PI 2B loses ethernet connection Why the Raspberry PI loses the ethernet connection? (also in comment @Fran Marzoa) Ethernet connection drops after several seconds (comment from @Suncatcher May 17 '17 at 9:33) Internet connection impossible through PC via Ethernet Share WiFi connection through ethernet Raspberry Pi 3 with CentOS no SSH without a keyboard With google query raspberry pi stops responding to ssh I find many other hints to this problem. Ensure it's not a problem with power supply I use a dedicated power supply for raspberry pi with 5.0 V / 3.0 A output connected to the micro usb power connector on the raspi. Except the ethernet cable and a for the serial console there is nothing else connected to the raspi. Ensure it's not a bad ethernet connection I use high quality double shielded CAT 7 ethernet patch cable. To test the connection I replaced the raspi with a laptop and do the ping test: 10.000 packets transmitted, 10.000 received. Ensure it's not a failure of the used hardware I use the same new class 10 sd card with the test program on two different Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and on a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B. It doesn't make any difference. I always have the same packet loss. Ensure it's not a bad sd card I flashed following sd cards with the test program for the ping test: sd card class 2, 4GB sd card class 4, 4GB sd card class 6, 16GB sd card class 10, 8GB sd card class 10, 16GB It all makes no difference. I always get the packet loss. Reproducible setup With this combinations of possible parameter it is not easy to get a reproducible setup and it is not said that this is valid for your test environment. For me I found to have: 

You are using two different GPIO numbering systems. The gpio utility is using wiringPi numbers. wiringPi 25 is actually GPIO26 on pin 37. RPi.GPIO is using GPIO numbers, so 25 refers to GPIO25 (which is on pin 22). Probably simplest if you change to use GPIO26 in your Python code, i.e. led = 26. 

When devices powered by the Pi stop working or start working erratically it's always worth checking out the power supply and for any recent software upgrades. Power supplies can fail and software can be broken. The voltage between TP1 and TP2 on the Pi should ideally be between 4.75 and 5.25. 

The way I initially connected was with a USB serial dongle at the PC end connected to the Pi's UART and ground. You can then use terminal emulator software to log in to the Pi. You then have the old fashioned 80x25 text window to enter commands etc. I think Windows users tend to use a tool called putty for the emulator (there was a tool called hyperterminal in the distant past). This is the sort of dongle you need. Try to get one with male to male jumper leads thrown in. $URL$ You can also connect the 5V to the Pi's 5V pin to power the Pi Zero from USB at the same time. I used this dongle.

switching between the two operating modes by script - either isolated network or connection to internet router. This has the disadvantage that pi.lan is down when connected to the internet router and vice versa. Invest into an additional wifi dongle. For me this is the best solution because we can make clean routing with all possibilities of network management. Use only the available network with internet router but restrict isolation with . 

This is a common problem with tons of documentation on the web. A very informative discussion I've found on [1]. In general there are mostly 3 ways you can "bridge" an ethernet wire to wifi. 1. real bridging on OSI layer 2 would be the best solution. But wifi needs additional information in the ip header for this. Many router uses this for WDS (Wireless Distribution System) [2] but need an additional address field enabled in the ip header. You usually can do this with: 

Generate a seconds worth of 100Hz pulses and add with wave add generic. Do the same with a seconds worth of 16Hz pulses and add with wave add generic. Then use wave create. The resulting wave will be the merger of both. You don't need to use a seconds worth, just enough so that the waves come back into alignment, e.g. 0.25 seconds would be enough. 

There are plenty of spare gpios to connect a 433MHz receiver (it only needs one gpio). Of course if you have a A+, B+, or Pi2 there will be more spare gpios on pins 27 to 40. The problem will be physically attaching any additional hardware. You'll probably need to solder wires to the underside of the pins as the LCD display will be blocking normal access. 

Some ESCs need to be "armed" by minimum and maximum pulse lengths (the 1000/2000). Your ESC may be different. Change 4 to the GPIO you use. 

There is a Problem with naming the root-parameter in cmdline.txt. So also mount , correct the boot-parameter in to the device-name and also in . Usualy this is and within a running raspi. Clean up. 

In the default Raspbian image I find &ast;raspberrypi&ast; kernel, bootloader, firmware etc. Using a bootstraped Installation I don't find them but using the same entries in /etc/apt/sources.list. In detail: With a default Raspbian image Update package lists, list raspberry packages and archive directory. 

Put the SD card into your raspi and boot. If you do exactly the same as above you should be able to ssh into your raspi through wifi. If not the raspi isn't the reason (or it's broken). Look at your environment. Or you have done wrong settings. 

Of course this will not fit your specifc needs. You may need to start other services and start your script before or after them. This can be defined in section . There are many examples out there on google. Please have a look at them. You may look here for starting after "network-up".
