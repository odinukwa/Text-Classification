If the font is installed on your computer, then maybe copying the text to some word processor does the trick? And even when not installed, some word processors might still show the requested name in their font dialog. (Other than that: a screen capture and WhatTheFont! might help, if it's worth the trouble. Or select the text, and then "print" the selection to a new PDF document, to see what its font properties shows then?) 

Due to using for the last parameter, this yields if the value is not found. This can be trapped with , like so: 

Battery issues are not much related to NVRAM/PRAM, but to the SMC. See Apple Portables: Resetting the System Management Controller (SMC). If this is the first time you calibrated your battery: after I purchased a new battery, my Mac would shutdown suddenly when the battery was running low, even after calibration. For some reason, it took me a few calibrations to fix that. I can't explain why, and it's quite likely that something else fixed it, but in the end the chip on the battery finally learned the true capacity of the battery. So, maybe one or two more calibrations might help... 

Sure it does, if the one who is in control of the telnet session knows how to do it. ;-) Your telnet command should yield something like: 

Earlier versions seem to support this kind of bridging as well, but your mileage may vary when not using an Apple base station (so, I don't expect problems for your situation). According to Apple's AirPort Express frequently asked questions: 

Using the proposed things like DynDNS.com will give you a "static" host name, but not a static IP address. If that friend really needs to know an IP address for the filtering then you're out of luck. 

...but if the extra memory implies less disk access, then the total power usage might decrease...? (Just guessing here.) 

You're basically asking how to get the n-th filtered value from some column into the n-th row of another column. Microsoft explains getting the n-th filtered value in Excel: Finding the nth Value That Meets a Condition. This uses "array formulas" to perform calculations on items in an array (a list). Microsoft's example can be extended to the get the value matching a row number. If your array is in , and you want to only show values , then the following can be used in (not tested): 

If that indeed shows some reference to your Hex editor then Thunderbird has messed up. If you don't see any reference to your Hex editor, or if it claims No such xattr: com.apple.ResourceFork, then somehow your Mac uses that Hex editor given the file's metadata attributes. Show that metadata using: 

And shows fine on my computer. It is a HTTPS URL, hence if your browser does not give you a certificate error, then you should be safe from being redirected to some third-party. 

"Your" IP address will actually be provided by that other network. Personal details (hence possibly including your location, or even your name): yes, if you don't use encryption to connect to personalised web sites or email servers. 

I assume Windows can have different proxy settings for different connections. (That's true for a Mac.) So: maybe some proxy server is misbehaving? For easy testing, Firefox allows for 4 different proxy settings: 

...that means you have to specify the serial number, without the . Optional parameters are enclosed in square brackets, . For, for example: 

In short: is there any way to get the full -details for domains like , using the command line on Max OS X? Running on the command line for, for example, is like searching for all domains that include that phrase. So, thanks to whois-spam, this gets one the following on a Mac or on FreeBSD: 

Select menu File, Save As, and be sure to select File Format: "Application". This will create something that looks like a single application, but actually holds a folder structure. In Finder, find the place where you saved the application, right-click it and select "Show package contents". Find file and open it with a text editor. At the end, just above the last two lines , add: 

I don't know how the image in my test was saved, but it does not have any EXIF data. Could the quality still be stored in the image? 

So, despite ignoring the warning, in this case you downloaded from the expected server. Certificates are all based on trust: you trust your browser, your browser trusts a few "certificate authorities", and those sell certificates to website owners. For better trust, the certificate authority should have asked for some proof that the domain(s) are indeed owned by the buyer. (If they don't, then if someone is able to mess with DNS servers and could buy a certificate for a domain they don't really own, then they might fool your browser into accepting that without any warning. In case of Mozilla, it's even an Extended Validation Certificate, so trust is high.) And most importantly: website owners know they should keep the secret parts of their certificates very secure. Without that secret part, another website cannot use someone else's certificate. So, cannot show a certificate that says it's , unless the secrets were compromised, or unless the two websites simply have the same owner or even refer to the very same server. So, unless trust of both DNS and the certificate were somehow compromised: if a server tells your browser that it is known as , then such is true. In your case, the server you downloaded from is known as , and is owned by the Mozilla Foundation. Now, Mozilla could have bought a certificate that lists both domains as being valid for that single server (using the so-called Subject Alternative Name). But I guess you just used an old domain, and Mozilla is expecting everyone to use the new one, and hence did not bother getting the old domain into the certificate as well. So, next time? 

When getting then, according to some James Sadler, you need to run . Indeed, on my account (admin, but not root), it is set like that. My OS X 10.6 is an upgrade going back to Tiger. In the same post, James also claims: 

You can surely test that using telnet as well. First, Base64 encode the string "username:password" (using, of course, the actual username and password; for this example), and then: 

Just in case in the future more keys are recovered: when copying the encrypted files also make sure you copy the Bitcoin wallet address, as that will be needed to search for decryption keys. 

Just for the archives, for those on a Mac: even Preview can easily do the trick, using annotations. (Control-Command-T to add Text.) 

I guess that calls for somehow adding an X-Forwarded-For header, like some proxy servers would do. But, though not an official standard, I wonder if it "allows" for IP addresses from a private range though. If you can make your browsers use GlimmerBlocker proxy, then you can add such headers through a Modify Request rule: 

For those looking for old versions to run on Mac OS 9, there's actually a new version of Mozilla being actively developed: Classilla, with version 9.1 planned for March 15, 2010. 

If you're not using keys: I can see there's a option too, but I doubt you can also set the password itself in that file. 

VPN clients (like the "VPN Network" in Windows) often have an option whether or not to redirect all traffic over the VPN connection. The remote VPN server may or may not actually allow such traffic. Note that OS X has a different default than Windows. Windows by default sends all traffic over VPN, but a Mac does not. (On a Mac, the Advanced button shows an option "Send all traffic over VPN connection". Windows has a similar option; in Windows XP it was called "Use default gateway on remote network", which would show by opening the properties of your VPN network, selecting tabsheet "Networking", selecting "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" and clicking "Properties", and finally clicking "Advanced"...) When all traffic is sent through the VPN, then even "normal" web browsing is done through the remote VPN server. This might be useful when traveling in some countries that filter certain web sites. As the VPN connection is encrypted, using it for all traffic might also be more secure when not knowing who can listen in to the network (hotel, internet café, Starbucks WiFi, ...) that is used to connect to the internet. And sending all traffic over the VPN might be a bit more secure as any "hacker" (or spyware) who has gained access to the workstation will be disconnected as soon as the VPN connection is started. It depends on the security of the VPN server whether or not such unwanted traffic could be re-established through the VPN server. It also depends on the policies of your company whether or not this option should be changed. 

That is: if it's a plain number, then simply divide by 1,000 using . Otherwise copy the first character using , and use to concatenate the remaining characters from position 2 up to the end given by and divided by 1,000. 

So, the success of depends on the actual structure of your document. I hope there's a better way, which also takes the actual hierarchy of headings into account (maybe something related to a table of contents), rather than just inserting references to possibly unrelated headings... 

I expected a sane browser to warn you when a form on a HTTPS site submits to a non-HTTPS URL (your first example). But some more testing reveals that such is only partly true† . April 2013: 

By default, Keychain Access shows the login keychain. If the sidebar does not show any other keychains to choose from, then hit Command-K (menu View » Show Keychains) to see more choices. On my Mac, both the login keychain and the system keychain show the same AirPort Network password, though the latter is a few years older. The first seems to be used by name and the latter by MAC-address. When looking at the Access Control to see which application can access the passphrase, then one sees some differences as well. But for another Wifi network I only have an entry in the login keychain. (Maybe the system keychain was used in previous versions of Mac OS X, but is still used if no entry in login is found?) I guess deleting all that matches indeed seems the best thing to do. (As a side note: when one has mounted some network drive with limited credentials, and one wants to change that credentials even when the old ones are still valid, then one also needs to search in the system keychain, not in the login keychain.) 

So, the question boils down to: why doesn't your neighbour get any authentication dialog on that computer. 

(Hence, for your example: right-click a low resolution image, choose Open in new window, and replace the suffix with , or for larger tiles, with the whole suffix instead.) 

(For those in doubt of replacing an Express with an Extreme: note that the latter does not support AirPlay! I noticed that just in time...) 

I doubt it will help you, but the "Open with" setting is stored in the resource fork. You can kind of display it using the following command from Terminal, replacing with your file: 

SFTP has no problems with port mappings, and thus no issues with NAT router/firewalls. (And, many home DSL and cable modems are in fact NAT routers, and attaching a standalone wireless access point might even introduce "double NAT".) In FTP, and hence in FTPS, multiple connections are needed. Client and server agree on the IP address and ports to be used within the so-called "application level" communications. But, a NAT router or firewall (which would rather only care about "transport level" issues) needs to know about these details, and hence needs to inspect the actual data. This raises many issues, which are non-existent for SFTP. 

As far as I know, Excel (2007) only allows undo twice while still editing a cell -- it's then basically toggling between the last edit and the previous cell contents. Going out of edit mode allows for normal undo behavior. (I've sometimes experienced that undo applies to all open workbooks: change file A, change file B, change file A again, and then undo twice while file A is active: the last change in A and B are reverted, not the two changes in A.) 

The makes the range absolute, and thus fixed when copying this formula to other cells. (In Excel, one could also use to search the whole column instead.) The last parameter, , makes this independent of any sort order in . Likewise, to get the index of the value in within the range : 

The bookmarklet is a bit hidden, as it is dynamically generated after one confirms their email address (by clicking a link in an email message one gets). It looks like this: 

Assuming you are using shared hosting, it could actually be attacked via another website running on the same server. If the shared hosting is not set up in a secure way, then sometimes other accounts can be used to read your files, no matter how well you set the file permissions. (Like: when the web server is set up to read any file, then some simple PHP script could be abused to browse files from other users.) 

(Err, yes, this answer is way too long. And there's no happy ending for the bullets! Highlights in bold...) The images from the question are defined in Apple's Last Resort font, which holds 236 different funny symbols. I guess the name says it all, but according to Wikipedia: 

Many inkjet printers actually even use (and thus: require) colour when printing in greyscale. If the colour cartridge is empty, such printers might refuse to print in greyscale, and thus will not print images. (And those might even not print black text when selecting greyscale.) When you don't need colour, get a black and white printer instead. Odd things have been reported. Like for some brands printing in black and white using best quality avoids using the colour cartridge, while selecting some economy mode would actually use colour: 

Or after login in using , start if you may want to come back later, to look at the progress or output. 

For HTTP, some proxies add some special HTTP header, like X-Forwarded-For, to specify the original IP address. If present, then its value should be used with care, as one can easily add a fake header and make it refer to some innocent person. Such header won't help you when dealing with FTP (which does not have the notion of HTTP headers), but maybe the same proxy IP address is in your web server logs at about the same time. If so, then you still need to make your web server write the headers to the log, or at least this special header.
