One way to do it is to specify the path of the actual file (using - You didn't say what package you are using) 

A simple star analogue design. Feed your voltage in 3.3volts lets say. Then from the "centre point" (Pin 1 Vcc) you calculate a set of resistors that will give you various output voltages when the reed switches activate which can be measured (Pin 4 Vdd) 

So you save allot of GPIO's but you have to work out a software solution now. There are several ways to work out the pins but you can leverage the speed of the Pi to set the GPIO's in a specific way, thousands of times a second. The benefit of this circuit is that you do not need diodes to control voltage flow. Sequential exploration of rows: 

Et Viola, you has Raspbian OS running on your machine, albeit in x86 mode and not in ARM So keep in mind anything specific to ARM will not work, like compiling ARM sources will not work! Use to install packages or if downloading packages use the x86 compiled ones 

If you would like to learn about OpenGL ES used on Raspberry Pi here is a interactive walk through with examples. You can find out more about OpenGL at opengles-book That can be useful for the GUI and at the moment you do not need X to run them (in some ways nice but in other not nice) You would also need to implement hardware decoding video using the available (and if licensed options) spoken about on the charities site. 

Try using the speedtest download file. If you still have bad speeds try and reboot your routers and switches. It could also be a bad cable but in the worst case its a faulty Pi. 

More debugging options You can also attach to any remote process without opening any project, and just clicking on the play button. But this won't work well if it crashed at launch, but may work if an app crashes at a specific location each time. 

It not really about the intensity of the light but about the timing. The Pi is not real time.. that is why you might have issues. The receivers on the TV's are very sensitive (specially designed for IR receiving) but the light signals flash so quick that you cannot even differentiate while looking at an IR with a camera (unless is a high speed camera) What you really need is a RealTime MCU like Atmega with its own oscillator (not built in one) because the frequency must be as perfect as possible each time you want to send your IR signals. Its like its sending morse code to the tv, in super high speed. Everytime you see a flash on your camera there could actually be tens or more flashing happening within 100 milliseconds sending specific "morse" code style that must be precise. Commercial devices are very very difficult to work with because if a segment of your IR is off slightly it will get rejected. This is to reduce IR noise from other remotes or remotes that send similar signals. The reason you have to be perfectly aligned is to do with timing. At an angle the light reflects differently and slight shift in time just gets rejected. There is nothing you can do to increase the range and increasing intensity of the IR light might make it worse! Because the IR does not need to be fully lit and the reciever can already see this. Here is an example I found on the internet. This shows that the LED actually flashes 6 times on and off within 1millisecond, with a short silence windows for separating . A remote could send this command 20 times a second but as longas 1 complete command gets to the TV that is fine. If more than 1 the TV knows not to repeat it unless the next second revies the same command (even if its 20 times). 

As demonstrated on the Arduino Atmega328. The RESET pin must always be pulled up so that the internal circuit knows it is operating normally. If this pull up drops to the point where the internal circuit thinks its changed from HIGH to LOW (because of battery going flat) that is known as a brown out- and the 328 will reset and behave erratically. So in this case it is imperative that the RESET pin is always HIGH to indicate normal behaviour. 

To use it you load the registry files into your windows, open up putty, load the colour profile. Then adjust your connection settings and other tweaks. Save that to a new profile. 

The problem is only 1 OS can use the SD Card module at a time and not several because of IO synchronisation issues that will corrupt data instantly. Each BCM runs of an oscilator and the internal mechanics decide what speeds to run at. If another Pi at even a slihgly varying clock speed would be connected you would have serious issues. It might be possible by multiplexing the channels, but speed will decrease exponentially since this becomes half-duplex. Say you connect 8 Pi's via a multiplexer.. then the speed will be reduced 8 times. Besides no normal operating system driver is capable of understating this "wait" period and will crash. It is possible theoretically to have several partitions and have other Pi's boot of these partitions over TCP/IP, but you cannot share the partitions because the driver disallows sharing of certain files to prevent Kernel Panick. 

I think to get RW access you need to unmount it while plugged in then remount it with . I am sure you can add that into your program to do this via the interface and calling bash command directly as 

Well it looks like a standard DynDNS protocol? The only reason that ps script will not work is because it is trying to setuyp recurring jobs. I do not think you can do that yet on Win10 IoT. By looking at the powershell file, all it is doing is a webrequest to a URL 

In my opinion the best way is NOT to keep the data file open the WHOLE time. I am unsure of the intrinsic workings of all these pipes/software but the concept is used in a lot of battery operated applications but even proper servers use this. What you can do is something in the lines of: 

High Low is detected on falling or rising edge, just putting 1v doesn't produce and edge so to speak and may be inconsistent. 

It depends on the chracter set that is programmed into the HD44780. The generic Hitachi has two code pages with a 16x16 matrix which gives you 256 characters per code page and 512 in total. The actual code that tells the LCD screen which symbol to use might not understand what you are trying to display and throws that error. You most likely need to set the PAGE and Select the character number you are interested in. 

Really, in the case of personal FM transmission, it is mostly down to the fact that if it works on an FM frequency, utilise that one. Some troubleshooting: 

Clients You can get the Plex client for Raspberry at RasPlex which is optimised for rendering playback but it will also play video via any HTML5 enabled browser via the WebGUI. Server for Raspberry Pi 3 Now with the Raspberry 3 we have an option of running a Plex server. There are no official arm packages but you can download pre-built Plex server packages. Please follow one of these two guides. 

UV4L driver, on Raspberry Pi 2 now support HTML5 embedded video with very low latency.I have tested it and it works great with HD video, no more flash plugins! Gstreamer pipes, ffmpeg or CVLC! Here are some more documentation about it, compatible with Pi1 also but with a few caveats. 

pcDuino is a great embedded device purely for the use of Linux (Or the Bastardized Version of Linux, called Android) The biggest version with comes in at $76 at SparkFun (But other venders are available and may be cheaper) but sadly it doesn't meet the Gigabit requirement (But you can add a USB Gigabit) Otherwise it is packed with allot more features and runs Ubuntu LTS! --Edit Nov'2015 There are newer version available now, Like PCDuino8 Uno 

There should be 4 pins but it seems like it pins and are connected to 3v3 on the PCB side. Not entirety sure what that is for to be honest. Never seen that before. As it turns out 3v3 is used to power the magnetics inside the RJ45 port. There are no direct connections between the pins and the PCB. Really pins and should be used for PoE. The schematic looks like they have the required 4 resistors but then it seems like they are connected directly to the shield and not even connected on the PCB. It may be possible to change this by replacing the jack with another magnetic jack but it doesn't look promising. Using a non magnetic RJ45 is not possible at all, unless you provide the magnetic components conversion separately. 

The code behind the server and the nodes is up to you. Pick a language you would like to learn, Python being the best documented with samples for Rasbpain and C# for IoT - With tons of documentation and examples too. Once you learn the basics, you can add data to a request. Like the name of the node, timestamps, or even post photos/video as binary. 

**WARNING: Boring electronics theory, hardly any pictures or diagrams, just black text... Amps do not make voltages more stable, Amps have nothing to do with that! What makes voltages stable is the quality of components and design of the power adapter. Cheap 1A power supplies usually drop to 800ma when they are loaded because, they are cheap! Cheap (or non existent) filter capacitors, simple voltage regulator and rectifier bridge used, usually burn out after 6~12 months. But that still doesn't answer why they supply 2 or 3 amp power supplies!? Even a 0.5 Amp will work (like plugged into TV USB for XBMC) but as long as you do not plug in any other USB devices, like WiFi it will generally not use above 500ma, but its a bad idea of course. A good power supply is a switched (switching) power supply, like the ones used in computers, but obviously we do not need 450watts! But you can get 25 watt (5v * 5A) and they cost 15USD (cheapbay) but they supply 5V at 0% load or 5V at 99% load, and they can provide up to 25 watts of continuous power, on cables up to 2 metres! Just because they are built better and have better electronics to filter (stabilise) voltages! As demonstrated in the graph below, the only reason that increases the load on the power supply (Amps) reduces the voltage is because unregulated power supplies (cheap) ones inherently have this flaw to them. So in the graph you see unregulated the voltage drops because the design is cheap, but really, in proper power supplies the load has no influence on voltage. Other reasons might be because they get better deals from the supplier, or you get a USB hub, which you power of the 3A, allowing you to connect a USB HDD, WiFI, USB TUner and the Pi to make a mean PVR. So the Pi will never user more than 1A and the 1.1A polyfuse will be happy! OK this graph shows the difference between the cheap power supplies you talk about and regulated power supplies. (Yay, a graph!) (The actual curve is more parabolic than linear, where the voltage starts to drastically fall at about 50%~70% load, but it illustrates the problem well)
