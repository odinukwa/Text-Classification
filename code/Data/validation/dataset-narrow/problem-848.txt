If you have console access to a Cisco Router you can use Cisco Password Recovery techniques to get in, then dump the cleartext config file via TFTP - you then have access to cleartext passwords, or passwords that are trivial to decrypt. So you do need to factory reset. If you haven't got the login details for the routers (in which case you can probably get in via SSH over a network connection), then you will need to use the above techniques to get in, then issue the command to drop the existing configs. 

The best/only way of minimising downtime would be to maintain both IP addresses for 48 hours, preferably on the same server, if your supplier will allow this. 

Well, yes you can do this, but you will have some underlying OS, even if it is a bare metal hypervisor. If it is a hypervisor, you will need another computer (running a GUI) to to access the VMs though. So if you are trying to do this on a single machine, you need to find the smallest OS that will still run the hypervisor. Or like duffbeer703 hinted at, wait till a BIOS level hypervisor comes out... 

I have a number of Cisco ASA 5505 and PIX 506e around the world acting as VPN endpoints. They connect to a Cisco VPN Concentrator 3000 at HQ. I am using Easy VPN to set up the VPN (i.e. most of the config is central on the VPN Concentrator) The majority of endpoints work absolutely fine. However, there are three that do not. 2 ASAs and 1 PIX get disconnected from one of the VLANs on our network. This is the VLAN that my monitoring server runs on - so those endpoints look as if they have gone down. However, I can still ping the endpoints from our user VLAN. If I then SSH onto the endpoint, and do a ping to my monitoring server, the connection comes back. Then after about 10 minutes it stops working again. I've looked at the configuration of my endpoints, and I can't see any significant differences. One common feature is that the affected endpoints are connecting to the internet via retail quality routers. However, I don't see how this could affect traffic within a VPN tunnel. Any ideas or suggestions? I've also got a thread on Cisco's forums at $URL$ One other person has reported the same problem. 

So this is kind of silly, but if you add to the end of the URL, it will go to the old page. $URL$ You might report this to Microsoft's web people using the "Contact Us" button at the bottom of the page - it seems like a bug due to them rearranging their SharePoint sites after the 2010 launch. 

Here is the Microsoft licensing information for Web edition: $URL$ And here is the list of technical limitations (compared to other editions): $URL$ I'm certainly no licensing expert but your use case seems to fit into the web edition model. 

I don't think what you want is built into perfmon. You could always take any counter and export it to Excel. There you can do any sort of data manipulation that you wish. 

IIS 7 has a new "request filtering" feature. You probably want to use the hidden segments configuration: 

FastCGI and PHP both have their own timeout settings that also affect this. See this blog post on IIS.Net for details: $URL$ The problem you are going to have is that some of these things (like the FastCGI configuration section) are done (exclusively if I remember correctly) at the file level, not in the file. You would need to talk to your hosting provider to increase the timeouts. 

I don't know of a definitive source for the Wake Source codes, but next time you see a 0, try running the following command at a prompt: 

2 possibilities for you. The first is kind of ugly, but there is another command called that does the reverse of - you give it a privilege name and it shows what users/groups have that privilege. You could script it to loop through all the privileges and show users/groups with that privilege - and further script it to list the users in groups instead of groups. The second is based on Powershell - get the Powershell Community Extensions and use the cmdlet. You get your own privileges by running: 

If you can save a file into the folder through Samba then you can examine the properties of the file to see which user and group own it - that should be your answer. 

High-end motherboards, as mentioned by larsks, should not be taken to mean motherboards that have "fakeRAID" support. If you have one of those then you will have a much better time using Linux soft raid, unless you want to dual boot another OS on the same drive array. Read up on Ubuntu FakeRaid support if you fall into this category and want to pursue it. 

Go with any Linux distro that VMWare have provided documentation for for your version of ESX, and whichever one you are most familiar with. If you aren't familiar with any, then just go with whatever version of Linux they were already running on. If that isn't consistent, then probably go with Ubuntu because it is quite well documented for a Linux newbie. 

I need to migrate a bunch of VMs from one ESX 3.5 Cluster to another. Storage needs to be migrated from one iSCSI SAN to another, as well as the VMs. Hosts on Cluster A have access to one iSCSI SAN but not the destination. Hosts on Cluster B have access to both SANs. Manually I can do this by powering down a VM, doing the migration with the storage specified to migrate as well, then powering up the VM in the new cluster. I know I can do this with multiple scheduled tasks, but the power on task cannot tell whether the migration has completed. I'd have to guess the appropriate times. How can I create a scheduled task that will do all this, with each step waiting till the preceding one has finished? Bonus points if anyone can suggest how I can also reconfigure the Network label used by the network card of the VM as part of the scheduled task - the new cluster has the port groups named differently, so I am not sure the VM will connect to the new Port Group correctly after migration completes (at least the manual migration tool is flagging a potential issue here). 

Create all of the new users on the new server On both the old server and the new server, get a listing of all the username to SID mappings. To do this, open up Powershell and run the command (on each server): get-wmiobject win32_useraccount | where { $_.localaccount } | export-csv serverusers.csv You've got some manual work to do now - you need to take both of the spreadsheets and map the SIDS from the old server users to the new ones. Create this in a new CSV () with a format this is something like: On the old server, save the ACLs for the files you care about using icacls. For example, if your files are in a folder called you would go into that folder and do: icacls * /save c:\acls.bak /T Now you need to do a search and replace on the acls.bak file - for every row in your CSV, find all instances of oldsid and replace it with newsid. Here is a powershell script to do that: $file = get-content C:\acls.bak -encoding unicode $csv = import-csv c:\sids.csv foreach ($row in $csv) { $file = $file -replace $row.oldsid,$row.newsid } set-content c:\acls2.bak $file -encoding unicode Copy all of the files to the new server Restore the ACLs on the files in the new server (again, assuming this is under c:\ftproot): icacls . /restore c:\acls2.bak /T 

You can directly call the SharePoint APIs through Powershell. Here are some links to help out: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

@resmon6 answer is excellent, but for the sake of completeness - if you save the config to a tftp server using passwords etc. are not obfuscated. 

If your dedicated host is assigning IP addresses like this, then they should be very familiar with providing support to their customers on how to get it working, so really - ask them, as you may need to use particular IP addresses and gateways on different physical NICs and only they will be able to tell you which these are. You need to understand what subnet each IP is on, and then a NIC or vNIC that has that IP assigned will need to have a gateway in the same subnet in order to be able to communicate with it. The config you posted set a gateway in a different subnet to the IP address assigned to the NIC. 

It isn't uncommon to find the device in each location that is making the VPN connection is also capable of acting as a DHCP server - e.g. Cisco ASA, Linux server, pfsense, m0n0wall. Depending on the capacity of the device and number of clients at the site, this might be worth taking advantage of. This is particularly useful where there may be site specific configuration you want to push out via DHCP. For example, you might want to include a public DNS server in the list of DNS servers assigned, so in case the VPN fails, but the Internet is up, people at the remote site can access public resources even if your central DNS is unreachable. It is also a lot easier to visualise/explain this way. 

This option was removed in Server 2008 as a security enhancement. This is because the application runs as the cluster service account which has elevated privileges. Even in 2003 clusters, the security best practice was to not have this checked. 

There is no scheduled time. If you are worried about missing them, Microsoft does have various security advisory notifcation methods available: $URL$ 

At this point you have the basics of what we need to accomplish your request. If you go to you will get your website from either Website 1 or Website 2, but it will be completely seamless that there are other sites. Now what you can do when you want to deploy a new version of your application is: 

If you are moving the database from one Microsoft SQL Server to another, you are better served by either using the "Copy Database..." wizard, or by taking a backup of the database and restoring it to the other server. The Export/Import wizards are for moving data to/from other database systems. 

I think when you are running SSRS in native mode, the most integration you can get with SharePoint is to use the Reporting Services Web Parts for viewing reports from your SQL Server. Take a look at this blog post for setup details: $URL$ 

According to this article, yes it does. The combination of Indexing Server and NTFS should make it so that any change to the file (including ACL) is indexed pretty instantaneously though, so they should never be out of date. Even if they are out of sync - if the actual file on the file system is more restrictive than what is indexed, the user will still not be able to view it. The worst that happens is they can see that the file exists (and any abstract/other properties you have setup.) 

This prompts for the password, then throws up the UAC dialog, and then opens the app. Is there a way to do this that bypasses the UAC dialog (without just turning off UAC altogether)? 

I have written a Sharepoint 2007 web part that sends a field from a form to a specified email address. I have got the form working as I require, but at present it can only send to internal email addresses. Sharepoint's email functions use SMTP to send to our Exchange 2003 server, but because our Exchange server is configured to prevent relaying, if the To: address is not at a local domain, it won't deliver the mail. I don't want to open up our Exchange server to be a completely open relay. What I want is to allow my Sharepoint servers to send mail to addresses outside our domain. The following seem possible: 

I just set up a Windows Server 2008 R2 domain controller. Since the reboot of the domain controller I have been unable to RDP to the domain controller with my Admin account. I get this message: 

My ASA 5505 has three VLANs. One connected to the internet called , one for our office called (which connects to the corporate VPN) and one for a publicly accessible . Each VLAN is on a separate subnet. I want to ensure that traffic from to the vpn or internet has priority over traffic from the . Put another way, I don't want the traffic to overwhelm traffic. I can create ACLs for my two inside vlans: 

Since you already solved the problem by rebuilding this isn't helpful to solve it - but for future problems, most of Hyper-V is manageable through WMI and you could have solved the problem that way. Rather than getting into the details of that though, I will link you to the Powershell Management Library for Hyper-V, which is a sweet Powershell based wrapper around the WMI calls. You could have used it to remove the NIC from the VM and that should have given you your access back. Get it installed now before you have future problems... 

I did some testing on this, and it does seem to be a bug - but only related to views that filter on blank/empty fields. I setup 2 views with alerts based on them: 

SSRS 2008 does (by default) not rely on IIS. You can run them side-by-side if you wish, but it is no longer required. To configure the URLs to access SSRS, you use the Reporting Services Configuration Tool - you probably want the "Advanced" configuration for Report Manager. See the following link for detailed instructions on how to setup URLs in SSRS 2008. $URL$ 

Here is a suite of powershell commands to perform actions against Hyper-V (including starting/stopping). They should be usable remotely through PS Remoting as well, but I haven't tested that. 

I would say that you are misunderstanding the purpose of this VM. It is intended as a quick way to give a demo of Office and SharePoint 2010, and do some high level evaluation. It sounds like you are wanting to make a full-fledged development machine out of it. If that is the case I would say you are better off creating your own VM from scratch so that you can control what is going on with the install.
