Failover of a LAG connection means that the traffic would failover to the link(s) still up. It is much, much faster than STP failover. It is even faster than routing protocol failover. Your BFD and OSPF session would remain up if there is at least one link of the LAG still up. Don't confuse the LAG interface, which OSPF and BFD use, with the individual interfaces of the LAG links. As long as the LAG interface is still up, and it will be if even one of the LAG links is still up, then OSPF will continue to run on the interface. The LAG interface decides which link a flow will use, and it will shift flows to remaining links when any link goes down. This is invisible to the flow. This happens very, very fast, and there is no way that OSPF would miss enough Hellos to decide the neighbor is down. 

I used to be heavily involved in designing and overseeing cable plant implementations, and I studied and earned the RCDD (Registered Communications Distribution Designer) and the RCDD/NTS (Network Transport Systems) certifications (both require at least two years of experience and strong references, so they are not just paper certifications), but I haven't worked on cabling itself for a long time. On the other hand, if you need to order transceiver modules for your equipment, it is quite helpful to know about different cable media, and which standards apply to each. You should clearly understand the most common IEEE 802 standards (you can get most for free), although it is unlikely that you will need to know much about Token Bus, Token Ring, FDDI, etc. You will need to be able to troubleshoot things, and if you don't understand how this stuff works, you are at a big disadvantage. Understanding the way ethernet, IP (both IPv4 and IPv6), TCP, UDP, switching (including the related 802 standards for thing like VLANs), routing (especially OSPF and BGP) all work are the absolute minimums. You should be familiar with the ethernet, IP (both IPv4 and IPv6), and transport (TCP and UDP) header fields, and the functions of each field. Depending on the job, you may need more specialized knowledge, like the various Wi-Fi (802.11) standards and headers, firewall technologies, data center technologies, etc. 

This establishes two static default routes. A lower AD will be in the routing table unless it goes down, at which point it is removed from the routing table, and the backup route is put into the routing table. This is invisible to the hosts because the hosts use the layer-3 switches for their gateways. Hosts don't know or care about the routing; all they care about is that they have a configured gateway, and the gateway is supposed to know how to route traffic toward the destination. 

This is something you really want to hire a cable vendor to do. Outside Plant (OSP) cabling is a specialty, and there are things you must do for safety (legal requirements), and things you must do to make sure the cable will not fail. For instance, outside cable is not allowed to extend more than 50' inside a building, you must bury it at least 24", or below the frost line, whichever is greater. Direct buried cable needs to be armored, loose-tube, and probably gel-filled. There is also grounding, bonding, and lightning protection that must be carefully done because the armor will be metallic. This is not something for amateurs, and the cable vendor will run bulk cable and terminate it to a cable patch panel with the appropriate type of connector. 

Yes, there are IPv4 options that may increase the packet header size. That is one of the things that IPv6 fixed. The maximum IPv4 packet header length is 60 bytes. An IPv6 packet header is always 40 bytes. 

Assuming Core0 is both the root bridge and HSRP primary for all three VLANs, and the uplinks are and , you should do something like this: Core0: 

The theory you mention was never a standard. In fact, RFC 1393, Traceroute Using an IP Option created a Traceroute option. This RFC has now been moved to Historic status by RFC 6814, Formally Deprecating Some IPv4 Options, Section 2.3. Traceroute: 

It looks like your problem could be that the path to the network is 40 hops (per the routing table of BR), and that far exceeds the RIP maximum hop count of 15 (16 hops being infinite for RIP). You may be able to solve this by creating a static route on BR and redistributing that into RIP with a much lower metric. 

With TCP throughput, there are a lot of factors which come into play. For instance, when the window is larger on a single link, congestion along the link could be a bigger factor. Because of congestion on the single link, IP packets could be dropped, causing TCP to resend segments, thus slowing down the transfer. There is also, a QoS function called RED (Random Early Detection) which randomly drops IP packets in order to prevent queues from becoming full. This forces TCP to slow down and resend segments. A window is just the amount of traffic which can be sent before needing to wait for an ACK. If it doesn't take long for the ACK to be sent back (how fast the receiver takes to send the ACK, and how long the latency is between the two hosts), your transfer may not be slowed much. The real way to dictate the speed of traffic flows is to use QoS to establish queues and bandwidths for traffic based on criteria you determine (e.g. DSCP markings). 

You have a cable which has the transmit and receive pairs reversed on one end, basically, a crossover cable for 10/100 Mb. You did not, however, create a proper 1 Gb crossover cable since you only swapped two of the pairs, and 1 Gb uses all four pairs. A lot of things today have Auto MDX, and they should be able to adjust, but not everything does have this, and those things won't work unless you use a crossover patch cable on one end (not both ends) of the horizontal cable. By the way, why go to the expense of Category-6 patch cables if the horizontal cable is Category-5e? This is completely useless, and could lead someone to believe that the horizontal cable is Category-6 when it is not. A cable plant should use the same rating throughout because the rating of the cable plant is the rating of the lowest rated link. 

MAC addresses are assigned with a vendor identification (OUI) and an identification which is unique to the vendor. There is no order to this in a particular LAN since you will have devices from multiple vendors, and even devices from the same vendor will not be in order. The IEEE assigns OUIs and defines how the LAN works. This only goes as far as the layer-2 boundaries. Layer-2 needs broadcasts to operate, and each and every broadcast must interrupt and be processed by each and every host on the LAN. This can get out of hand very quickly, placing a practical limit on the size of a layer-2 network. Imagine having you PC pounded by broadcasts from every host on the Internet; it couldn't keep up. There are also multiple types of LANs which are not directly interoperable. For instance, Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) can't directly communicate with ethernet (IEEE 802.3). You would need a translation bridge at layer-2 like used to be used between token ring and ethernet, or you move up the stack to layer-3. This is where layer-3 steps in. Layer-3 is independent of the layer-2 protocol used by the hosts. It has its own addressing which is independent of the layer-2 addressing. Layer-3 addressing is hierarchical, allowing segmentation of layer-2 LANs so that broadcasts and other communications can be isolated. If that's not enough addresses for you, layer-4 can have its own addresses, too. For instance, TCP and UDP use addresses which are called ports. Upper layers can have addresses, too, but there is no real standardization for those; the application designer can create any addressing desired for an application. Hosts are unaware of the layer-2 address of other hosts. They need some sort of layer-2 protocol to help with that, and many were developed over the years, but the limitations of layer-2 didn't allow layer-2-only networking to scale to the size of today's networks. When a host wants to talk to another host at layer-3 (I will assume IP as the layer-3 protocol for this, but the concept applies to any layer-3 protocol), it must determine if the other host is on its own LAN. It can do this by masking the destination address with its mask and comparing it to its own network. If the destination host is not on its LAN it will need to send the traffic to its configured gateway which will be on its LAN. At this point, the host needs to discover the MAC address on it LAN, either the destination host or gateway. To do this, it uses ARP. ARP sends a broadcast asking, "To whom does this layer-3 address belong?" The destination host or gateway will respond with its MAC address, and the sending host will use that to create the frame and send the traffic. The sending host will also cache the layer-3 to layer-2 resolution for a period of time so that if there is more traffic destined for that layer-3 address, it already has that information. If the layer-2 destination is the gateway, the gateway will get the frame and strip it off, leaving the layer-3 packet. The router will then determine where to send the packet next, and it will create a new layer-2 frame for the new layer-2 segment over which the packet must travel.
