Now if I start 'cec-client' from the command line, I will see it output information when I press the "Play", "Stop", "Pause", etc. buttons on the television remote control. So from that perspective, the system is working. I'm not sure if you can send commands from the RPi to the television, but if you figure out how to do it I would love to know! :) P.S. I unplugged the HDMI cable from the television and ran 'cec-client -l' again. It reported the same information, so the television doesn't seem to matter. 

The implication, to me, is that not every feature is supported. If that feature is not supported, the device should respond with "Feature Abort". Let's say I try to send the command using the following: 

That should put the text "A B C" on the screen, but it does not. That's reasonable if the television doesn't support that feature. Unfortunately, the tail of the cec-client output looks like this: 

This was very important to me as I do not have the admin password for the router I connect to. Now, I will say that even once I identified the ip address of my raspberry pi, I still couldn't connect even though nmap says the port was open. I immediately get a message of... 

You can mount the same device in multiple directories simultaneously. You can create mounts anywhere you want to mask a directory. 

I hear a lot of "couldn't find it on the network" issues. I'm going to suggest running this to find all the machines with the ssh port open. 

I can take that hash and use it for browse the state of the source code at the time this image was created. To do this I put that hash at the end of this URL: 

This is still not documented anywhere, but the rc_gui tool (I'm assuming it would be a graphical user interface to the raspi-config if I were to ever install the full desktop) uses command line options to the raspi-config bash script. You can see the full list of options in the C source code 

I purchased a PiTFT from AdaFruit. I'm drawing directly to the screen by memory mapping /dev/fb1 and that is working. The problem happens when I update the screen with the color white. I can see faded remnants of the previous image in the new white image. Eventually the previous image fades out entirely and then I see a solid white image. I've tried blanking the previous image with black before drawing white, but that did not solve the problem. Is there way to work around this problem or is it a limitation of the display? It's fairly noticeable, so I would like to clean it up if possible. 

What is the easiest way to watch YouTube in a web browser when using Raspbian? I tried using something called PiVid with Chromium, but videos never played (despite it otherwise working as described here: Bringing YouTube to Raspberry Pi Browsers. I was not able to try Midori due to a problem with ICU (I'm running a custom version). Do I need to use a certain release date? 

My Pi used to freeze up and I tracked it back to the 800mhz overclock that they say "most Pi's can handle". I used to get freezes every few hours. Got rid of ALL overclocking settings and got it running at stock 700mhz and I haven't had a freeze since. Overclocking options are in . All the overclocking options explained here. Hope you get it sorted out. 

I'm wanting to use my Pi as a dashcam and I'll have it set ffmpeg to make mpeg4 recordings. On the Motion website here they describe you being able to generate mpeg films I have done tests where i cut the Pi's power as its recording to simulate a "car crash" or the car stalling(with no UPS). I assumed that the recording that was happening as the Pi lost it's power would be saved up to the point where it lost power but the file was 0kb with no recording at all. I'm stuck here and have messed around with lots of settings trying to get this working. I need this to work "On the fly" because I'm planning to use one of these as a security camera and if someone was to cut the power supply cable I wouldn't get a video of the person. A UPS isn't an option as this has to be as tiny as possible(half the reason why I use the tiny Raspberry Pi Camera Board) 

(imaged from 2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie-lite) Steps 1. For me it was enough to simply install OpenVPN via: 

Hey look it does! That means I can probably find a copy of the image at $URL$ I can now download that image and run it on a local device and experiment with possible solutions. My day now looks like 

I did not need to change anything. (Though I did uncomment when I was losing my mind, I changed it back and reboot to confirm the statement ) 4. I lost my mind reading 2 dozen articles explaining everything about installing EasyRSA and everything else the was redundant to step #1. 5. I realized that I left the wrong extension on my config and did: 

So, yes there are many paths that you don't want to backup. You avoid most of them by mounting your primary partition at a 2nd directory. Others will still have data you don't want to backup like , , and . My process went like this... 

I'm wanting to use my Pi as a dashboard camera and I'm wanting motion to save its files to the usb but it doesn't have permissions to save to it. The usb is currently FAT32 so I can plug it into a Windows PC and see the files. If making it ext4 will fix this I'll do it. The motion daemon needs to have access to the usb without a user logging in as the Pi will be headless. I have tried setting user to nobody in the permissions but I get Operation not permitted errors, even running as root user. Any help will be appreciated. 

Are there any other characters that are used to make comments other than the and that mean special thing? 

I use Motion detection and a webcam as a security camera. It's headless with no internet or keyboard. To turn the camera off while it's not need I just turn the power supply off. Because I shut it down this way the time doesn't get saved onto the SD card, which I think happens on a normal shutdown?, so when I boot it up next time the time it loads off the SD card is way back to the last time I ever shut the Pi down correctly. This makes the timestamps and file names of the images Motion is storing on my USB stick double/triple/quadruple up with previous recordings and it makes it hard to sort through and some files also get overwritten. I am wanting to know a way where a script(the one that saves the time on normal shutdowns) saves the current time of the system every 10 minutes or so, so that if the Pi looses it power and turns back on, it will continue making recording from where it previously was(within 10 minutes)(might overwrite a few minutes worth). 

UPDATE: I notice that there is nothing in there about the locale or keyboard settings. So, that suggests to me that we must examine the source of . Luckily we have plenty examples above to get an idea of how to use that script eractively. So, what I need to do to solve this problem headlessly is: 

TL;DR: In your configs must end in and not ! Environment I'm about to make some bold claims that are specific to... 

I can also go to $URL$ to see if the first 6 digits of the hash acc4f5 matches a release that is ready to download. 

The content of will give you the precise git commit of the pi-gen repo that was used to create the image. It is unfortunate that you have to be able to mount/read the EXT volume in order to see it. I have created an issue for that. Here is how you can use that file. I have a device deployed 2,300 miles away that is experiencing an issue, but I am still able to SSH in. The content of is:
