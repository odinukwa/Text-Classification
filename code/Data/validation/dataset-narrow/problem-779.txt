although it would be nice, but there is no unapply available. you would have to write an undo recipe yourself, depending on what you did exactly (installed package? then purge it, added user? then disable it, etc.) the replaced files should be stored in the clientbucket (/var/lib/puppet/clientbucket usually but it depends on your version and your setting) 

Puppet is not really designed for deployment because when there is a large number of files involved you could run into issues. You can look into capistrano for app deployment. $URL$ 

you need to use a load balancer with its dns record at www.example.com to forward different traffic to different backend servers based on the requesting port. if you don't have a hardware lb, you can use something in software such as haproxy. 

Also, it should be noted that if an account is locked due to too many authentication attemps, you won't see that in /etc/shadow. You can find out the failed logins count of an account with 

Elinks which originates from links. It has support for Javascript, tabs, frames, tables... I also like w3m, but I don't think it supports Javascript. 

I have a mounted NTFS partition under Windows (2003) and Linux (RHEL 5.7) at the same time. The LUN resides on SAN and is presented to both servers at the same time. At first, the setup looks ok as I initially can see files from both Windows and Linux. Writes are only initiated from Windows and I mounted the partition under Linux with read only (ro) and no access time (noatime) options. But when I add files from Windows, I can't see them under Linux. Is there anything I'm missing? Is it even possible at all? I would like to achieve this in order to avoid copying from the network for a data migration of > 1Tb. Do you see any other way to do it? 

You can study livecd layout of your distro, but likely you need /var instead of /var/log and in some distros there are files in /etc that must be writable. /home as well unless you put home dir elsewhere. 

If you cannot even ping the localhost, then try to ping lo addresss 127.0.0.1 to see if that works. If not your lo interface is not up and you need to fix that. Dhcp working? Does that mean your virtual nic is getting all the network information? What does ifconfig command return by the way. 

Port can be reassigned to confuse people etc., so if you have a plain http server actually listening on port 443 then your http url should work, and vice versa. However the restriction you are facing may be more than just the port. Since ssl and http are different protocols, it is trivial to figure out that the packets are not http and your connection is thus blocked. It is probably easier to do ssl tunneling if your http traffic in this case. 

We have many sites world-widely, in which a Linux server (tftp, PXE, nfs, dhcp service, http enabled) is used to deploy Linux clients automatically unattended. Now we have a needs to deploy Windows 7 clients. How to do that? I have some thoughts, and a lot of questions. 

We have a NFS server provide home directory for many account, which provided by a NIS server. I have account A and B. In /home/A, I try to copy "cp -a /home/B/somedir ~/". Then I found in /home/A/somedir, all files are owned by user A. Then if I do "chown -R B:B somedir", I got "Operation not permitted" error. I am user A, "cp -a" didn't preserve the original user (B). Then I cannot chown my own files. Any suggestion? I fix my own issue by "chmod 777 /home/A", "su - B" and "cp -a somedir /home/A/", and "su - A", then "chmod 755 /home/A". But it is not a good solution. 

you need to find and replace that uuid in your grub configuration, something like /boot/grub/menu.lst in grub. in grub 2, /boot/grub/grub.cfg is generated when you run update-grub, so you could temporarily modify that file and boot, and then change the grub settings and run update-grub once you have booted into your OS. another option is to temporarily replace the uuid reference to the actual disk partition, and again fix that later. 

I would suggest that you use a network server with a filesystem designed to handle what you need. The first thing that comes to mind would be something that supports zfs (freenas and nexenta, though the free version of the latter has some limitations) or if you can afford it you can buy something like netapp. I am less familiar with UFS available on freebsd etc., but heard that would work too. 

There are several admin-like accounts in our Linux server, different account for different purpose. Sometimes, there need multi-account co-work to finish a job. Manually, I can login and type the commands. But How can I make it into a single script (BASH)? BTW: sudo didn't work on my server 

both [[ string1 == string2 ]] and [[ string1 = string2 ]] means equal. But some other guy told me their machine don't support ==. The error message is: syntax error: `==' unexpected. Seems they use pretty old UNIX with korn shell and I'm using REHL5.2. Since I cannot access their machines, how do I find out which version start to support "=="? Thanks 

there is no known way of querying the config of a running sshd instance, i think, if you are referring the openssh server. depending on what you want to do, you could use the -t flag to test a configuration file to make sure that it is valid before restarting the server, so that you don't get kicked out, esp. if you do not have any out-of-band access to the server. 

As long as the user can write and create files in the directory with your log files, you can use another user. However, if your logrotate config is editable only by root, then I don't see much risk there. If someone can subvert that they can gain root and can cause far more harm than just messing up with log files, so the concerns, while certainly exist, do not really justify customizing a standard app such as logrotate. 

If you really want to use , you need to first select a window with , but be aware this configuration does not configure logging for all windows... 

Vim has vimdiff mode which is quite good. It obviously works in console mode too. It give you color highlighting of differences and the possibility to edit the diffed files efficiently. Vim is also installable or even installed on most *nix system these days... It is better if you already know Vim though... 

I'm looking to transfer data across 2 lv of an HP-UX server. I have a couple of those transfers to do, some of which are mostly binary (Oracle tablespace...) and some others are more text files (logs...). Used data size of the volumes is between 100Gb and 1Tb. Also, I will be changing the block size from 1K to 8K on some of these partitions... Things I'm looking for: 

I have a build with a text parameters in Jenkins, when I input big data into text area and try to build, it comes 

When the host xxx try to request a dhcp, the dhcp server shows error: DHCPDISCOVER from AA:AA:AA:AA:AA via eth0: network 10.0.0.1/24: no free leases. But when the host yyy ask for a ip address, the dhcp server do give out a DHCP offer. Can I assign 192.168.0.0/24 address within a dhcp server only have 10.0.0.0/24 interface? How can I configure to make it work? 

Is there any workaround? Thanks! my ENV: java.runtime.version 1.6.0_41-b02 org.jenkins-ci.main:jenkins-war:1.502 

local -> gateway ( only ssh port enabled ) -> remote I can ssh to gateway then to remote, no problem. Can I establish a ssh tunnel between local and remote via gataway? I 'd like to access local:9980, which will forward to remote:9980 via gateway. I'm worried about tunnel using port 22 on gateway will be a trouble for others' ssh use. Thanks
