You'll need your Audit Policy set appropriately so Windows will log the events in the first place (why this isn't a default setting is beyond me). Additionally you will want to use different EventIDs ( and ) for Windows Server 2003. 

This is the crux of it. The fact that you can temporarily "resolve" this by rebooting the access point without making any changes elsewhere inclines me to believe the issue is with the access point itself. You should verify that rebooting the access point does "resolve" this issue by waiting until a client reports the problem, verifying that the problem exists and then reboot the access point to see if it resolves. Do not physically move the client once it generates this issue, as it might simply be that users report the issue, move somewhere else and the issue isn't present any more due to better signal strength instead something related to access point. If you are not using Enterprise or Business grade access points your problem is likely best solved by replacing them with appropriate devices. The economics of commodity grade 802.11 equipment does not encourage the production of resilient devices. 

You should confirm with that services actually are listening on those ports with a and then narrow the scope of your troubleshooting from there. Is it possible that you have additional Windows Features that you need to uninstall? 

The PackageCode is different. The Installation Sources should be different too. From the user downloaded executable installer: 

This is more or less true. Back before switching technology subnetting to account for the total amount of broadcast traffic was a serious concern. Now days though switches are much more efficient both in terms of general architecture compared to hubs (i.e., they do not forward EVERY packet to EVERY port) and they are better with the broadcast traffic they do have. I have heard WAG numbers that 500 clients per subnet is about where you should start to consider subnetting based solely on traffic and broadcast domain concerns but I would not be surprised if enterprise-grade switching hardware could handle much more. Obviously, test and test again as everyone's workload is different. 

We have two Windows Server 2008 SP2 (sadly not 2008 R2) Domain Controllers in a small 150 client domain that are exhibiting very "peaky" CPU usage. The Domain Controllers both exhibit the same behavior and are hosted on vSphere 5.5.0, 1331820. Every two or three seconds the CPU usage jumps up to 80-100% and then quickly drops, remains low for a second or two and then jumps up again. 

Do you have DNS aging and/or DNS scavenging properly configured? As you said yourself, it sounds like you have too many old DNS records hanging around on your domain controller. My suggestion is to look into setting up DNS scavenging or at the very least, delete the old A record (x.x.x.84) and then renew your workstation's DHCP lease for testing purposes. DNS scavenging will periodically remove the old DNS records that were dynamically generated when a client received a DHCP lease. This is a Good Thing (TM). DNS records are only good (and useful) if they are actually fresh. Having a bunch of records that point to clients that are no longer there isn't useful. You might also want to look at your DHCP lease TTL to make sure that it appropriately matches your DNS TTL and "aging" policy. A contrived example: if your TTL for DHCP leases is 12 hours and your DNS aging policy is to keep records for three weeks, you're just setting yourself up for trouble. The earlier mentioned technet blog post is a good place to start. 

Just as a first pass try giving the switch as apt-get will then try to install postgresql and postgresql-common from squeeze-backports but not its dependencies (in this case logrotate). I don't have a Squeeze system to test with, but I think this is what is happening: Squeeze is no longer the current release of Stable and is now oldstable. Squeeze-backports pulls its packages from the then version of testing (Wheezy) which is now the current Stable. The version of postgresql that you are trying to install is actually from the current version of Stable but was designed to run with most of its dependencies from oldstable (i.e., logrotate 3.7.8-6 from oldstable/squeeze compared to logrotate 3.8.1-4 from stable/wheezy) but since squeeze-backports and wheezy are roughly analogous using the switch means that it's trying to pull logrotate from wheezy's repositories for some reason instead of being satisfied with version 3.7.8-6 which is included in oldstable/squeeze. Generally this is caused by either having the wheezy repositories added explicitly with bad apt-pinning policies setup or you have repositories that are pointed at a release-type (stable/testing/unstable) and not a Release (squeeze/wheezy) in which case you have a much larger problem. You should endeavor to fix your issue by upgrading to Wheezy as it is the current version of Stable. This is the best solution for a whole number of reasons. If you can't or are unwilling to do that, try using the switch so you don't pull the dependencies for postgresql from backports or using apt-pinning to pull the required stuff from Wheezy. 

Seems logical to me. The network space aside, you only have so many clients and they can only produce so much traffic. 

@Evan Anderson's answer has most of what you need. A few additions. There's really no reason to spread out your patch panel locations unless you have a specific requirement to do so (such as subdividing the floor and renting to separate tenets). Keeping everything in one location drastically simplifies things. In my experience, it almost always preferable to home run your stuff back to a central cabinet. The other thing I really wanted to add is to over-provision! If you (or a contractor) are rewiring provision for the future. We often spec out twice as many network drops in a room than the requirements originally qualify for. And almost always we end up filling them in a few years. I'm not sure how you do your phones but here's another neat trick. If your phone company can relocate their demarcation area to your new network closet, have them terminate their phone lines in 8P8C connectors (i.e., RJ-45s). Then all you have to do to relocate someone's phone is just patch from the telco's panel to the appropriate wall jack. As a bonus, if you ever go to a VOIP phone system in the future you won't have to pull new cable. This will of course require cooperation between your phone service provided, your cabling contractor and you, but it is well worth the effort as it greatly simplifies dealing with phone service.
