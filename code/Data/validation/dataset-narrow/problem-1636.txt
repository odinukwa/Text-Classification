I figured out the problem was due to a bad power supply. I turned it on with nothing pluged in and it worked. I swithched to a better power supply and now it works even with the dongle pluged in on start up. 

I would check the voltage one the tutorial link posted. It is for a 12v strip. Yours says 24v? Raspberry pi 5v. Seems a bit inefficient to me. 

I want to get my 13 year old coding. I have a RPi3 I downloaded Retro pi so he could check it out. He went online and found all the cases that are out there for it. He wants one so he can build the retro pi game system. He will get board with the game system soon enough. My question is if we use the zero for Retro-pi and want to later add raspbian will we have enough RAM to do both or should I buy a different model to begin with? 

When I power up Pi Zero, I get to the page to boot into safe mode and the screen goes black for a few seconds and then flashes and shows four colored squares in the top right corner of my screen. If I try and press shift to boot into recovery it does the same thing. I have not seen this issue before is it my SD card or possibly a power problem 

The systemd files ensure that when the installer is done and reboots that the system automatically logs in. The .bashrc file ensures that when it logs in that first time, it performs the remaining installation that you choose in the full Raspbian rather than busybox, which makes it a whole lot easier. 

I would recommend FooDeas/raspberrypi-ua-netinst as the base for making your installer. Download a released zip, configure a few files, put it on the SD Card, put the card in your Pi and it will boot up and install however you choose without needing any further intervention. I have written a blog post here that explains how to turn it into an installer that can do anything you want. (By showing how to automatically install NodeJS). There are a number of ways raspberrypi-ua-netinst can be made to perform complex installations but I only explore one method fully (both here and in my blog). The raspberrypi-ua-netinst installer, as it is, is slightly limited. As it is, you can easily do the following: 

I'm struggling to figure out how the WiringPi C library manipulates the GPIO hardware. Is it possible to change multiple output pins on the GPIO simultaneously in C using the library? For example, writing a byte onto 8 of the pins? And would this be slower than modifying one pin at a time? 

If I use a password manager to store all passwords including my password for the pi itself. Does any type of text file or folder get created and stored anywhere on the raspberrypi..or only on the usb drive? 

This question is unclear. What exactly do you want to know? I also started with zero knowledge of RPi 9 months ago so I understand being overwhelmed. However you are not giving enough information and asking to many vague questions to get any good answer. You need to tell us things such as what RPi you have and what operating system you have. I assume your not using the command line but a GUI. But assumptions help no one. These are just examples only the tip of the iceberg. If you do not have a basic understanding of the device you are using how can you expect to control it? I strongly suggest going to $URL$ click on help and then click on the documentation box. Start from the setup/quickstart tab and read every section of every tab finishing with hardware. Then visit the learning resource center. You mentioned something about drum beats or something and gpio pins and a breadboard. Making a beat has nothing to do with the pins. If you have an SD card with NOOBS then you have Sonic pi a program for making music. That is just one option, there are many more. I am still very new but confident in what I know and I know more everyday. I decided to learn from the command line. I knew that I was getting a raspberry pi to learn Linux, Bash, python and php. I had no project in mind only learning the tool. At first I read and practiced the basics of getting around the system, knowing how to operate it and what is on it. Also learned about copying, making and moving files. I learned my network and things like SSH login. I set up a web server, copied and backed up my system. I learned what packages were installed and how to install then remove other packages. Do you know how to get packages or use github? You are confused because you are jumping steps. You can't get answers to your question because you are not asking answerable questions. I speak from experience. learn the basics first. Ask questions as you encounter them. Dont dismiss sections because you feel that it wont apply to what you want to do, because it just might...you dont know what you need to know. 

Im trying to compile C for a PIC16F using SDCC on the RPi. It's slow going but I hope that installing an up to date version of gputils as per here will help. So how do I do that? I previously installed gputils simply by apt-get (Stretch, RPi 2). I cant work out how to tell what version it installed. Do I need to compile it? Or will some binary be what I want? Please assume minimal linux competence! 

Beginning Raspbian Jessie (and I presume future versions as well), has been replaced by . So instead, follow instructions here. It will automatically log in as user To quote the answer, create this file: 

I want an external circuit to know when the Pi has started booting up and finished shutting down. How early/late is it possible to control the pins? And how might it be done? I'm thinking of writing a simple C program and using systemd to control when it's run. But how early/late would this actually be able to work? What software alternatives are there for controlling GPIO state as early/late as possible, short of recompiling the kernel or other high-skill methods? Also I want to avoid hacking the hardware, as I would want to make a hat for the Pi with this circuitry, and I want to be able to install it on a normal Raspbian installation 

I bought my son a pi zero w. Originally we he wanted Retropi. Now he wants to stream Steam instead. I found information that said adding a graphics card to RPI 3 it is possible to stream some games. I have found no information referencing the pi zero at all. Does this mean it is not possible? 

$URL$ You will need to calculate that question yourself. The cost of mining and hash rate is unique to every miner. If this is endevor is a must for you I suggest you look at pooling if that is still an option. Keep in mind the calculations that are trying to be solved to actually get any bitcoin are very complex and take alot of power That needs to be apart of the equation. Join a bit coin forum they can help as most of the users are currently mining. 

Is it possible for Raspberry pi to flash Noobs to any Android device? I have no device I am actively trying this on yet. If it is possible I a Nexus device running Android is what I would try to work with. I want more control over my Android. 

The USB ports run off a single USB controller so you can't just disable a single one. And the ethernet also runs off the controller, so you wouldn't be able to use it if you disabled it. Even if you did disable USB, it would save very little power. Wifi, CPU and RAM use the most energy, as well as the graphics processor. To use less power you could also disable the LEDs which would probably help more than turning off the USB controller. So reduce the software running on your Pi that uses a lot if CPU, that will help the most. And use ethernet instead of wifi if you can. Disable graphical output if you're working headless. "Tearing" off the USB ports is a really bad idea, and wouldn't do anything anyway. 

You can monitor the entire install process via the UART if you connect a serial-to-USB converter to the Pi's UART GPIO pins and the USB of your PC or similar (using Putty if you're on windows). The systemd files make it log in as root with input/output via the UART so you can easily interact with it without having to rely on a working SSH connection. Just change the contents of to perform the remaining configuration of your system, eg install and configure Apache etc. You can bundle your files for with the installer files directly on the SD card. In case my blog goes down or whatever, the key to my method is you create a file with this in it: 

I have a Netgear router that is compatible to flash DD-WRT. I have read you can use mac windows or linux. I only have a RPi3 no other computers. Will my Rpi3 work for this? I am running the latest Rasbian and have a 16G sd card. 

Dude It is very well documented no motors for the pi. Get arduino, sparkfun, or adafruit micro controller for this stuff. Pi and Arduino work well together and both offer features the other lacks. Just as a reference check out the Arduino web IDE. Open file-examples and see all the possibilities instantly. RPi can not compare in this way 

I saw a variety of answers. some I knew and some i did not know. There is also one I always use that has not been listed yet. If it has and I missed it oops sorry. sudo hostname -I 

I am running Raspbian jessie 8 on my RPi3. I am trying to see what version of samba is installed if any. I do not remember installing it as far as i know it is for remote access but I am not totally sure. It seems like when I update I see it updating but again i am not 100% sure. Can some one give me a hint on the command. I have already tried uname -a, smbd -v, and smbdstatus. 

Then just create some script, and in call your script, and ensure the script will not get called in future. There are other possible solutions; in the issue discussion, one person explains how he made his own repository and package which he configured the installer to use. He also posted a link to the source. And there are one or two other suggestions as well. My method isn't perfect, but for the sake of keeping things short I will leave it as it is - it will get you off the ground. Mainly I suggest reviewing secirity since everything is done as root. But please do let me know if you have any issues or suggestions. 

Why? They use relatively little power, are easy to set up as a cluster since come with ethernet, and are quite cheap. If you use the graphics processor to crunch numbers, the Pi is actually rather powerful. They have minimal components, a powerful and efficient ARM processor, and are well-supported software-wise. They might not be the very most efficient solution in one way or another, but easy and affordable for a tech hobbyist. Like with any cluster, some possible uses:
