I think the scope of the organization matters a lot. If there are 200 hosts total or less on a network and traffic doesn't need to be segmented for any reason, why add the complexity of VLANs and subnets? But the larger the scope, the more it might make sense. Splitting up networks that normally wouldn't need to be can make some things easier though. For instance, our PDUs that supply power to servers are in the same VLAN or subnet as the servers. This means our vulnerability scanning system used on our server range also scans PDUs. Not a huge deal, but we don't need PDUs to be scanned. Also it would be nice to DHCP the PDUs since they are a pain to configure, but since they are in the same VLAN as servers right now, that is not very feasible. While we don't need another VLAN for the PDUs, it can make some things easier. And this gets into the whole more vs less VLANs argument that will continue on for ever. Me, I just think have VLANs where it makes sense. If for instance we gave PDUs their own VLAN it doesn't mean we always have to give small groups of devices their own VLAN. But rather in this case it might make sense. If a group of devices doesn't need to have it's own VLAN and there are no advantages to doing so, then you might want to consider just leaving things as they are. 

Besides making your own CD, you will also need to recompile the kernel. I haven't done this in awhile so I'm not sure how much help that link will be, but most docs I have followed in the past have been fairly straight forward. If you need further help you might want to stick to the Ubuntu forums. Some of the followers on those forums are masters at this stuff. Recompiling the kernel should also allow you to make a truly customized CD that should run pretty speedy, because you can take out modules you know you do not need. 

Sounds to me like the issue exists with the computer or your account. I'm hesitant to think its an issue with your account since you say ADUC works on other computers, presumably with your account. Does the computer you try this from have a connection to the network? I would assume so, but it might not be a bad idea to do a release and renew from the command prompt. Also verify the IP settings to make sure they are valid for your network. The computer you are trying this from, is it on the domain? If not add it then try ADUC. If it is, check the computer name and make sure an object exists for it in Active Directory. If the object exists, try removing the computer from the domain through System Properties and re-adding it to the domain after a reboot. If none of that helps I'm bout out of ideas... I will update if I think of anything else. 

I'm not sure how well my answer applies, but at my company we use ESX and virtual center to manage. When I log into Virtual Center I look at our ESX server settings, not the settings of the individual servers. We have 5 ESX servers in a clustered environment, so I'm just looking at one of those 5. I click on the configuration tab, then "Virtual Machine Startup/Shutdown". I have seen this option before in other versions of VMWare, so I bet you have it too somewhere. Once in there you can edit the properties of this item and choose how servers startup/shutdown. We set all of our servers to "Any Order" except the absolute critical ones, those are ordered, but we only order a select few. Hope this helps... 

Unfortunately the answer for you depends on your situation and scope of backup project. At my company we are quite large and backups are deemed crucial so we use a Netapp solution. I would agree with you and shy away from a hard drive to hard drive backup though just over USB. I would consider having a backup server if possible and large storage space so that you can go as far back as needed. One system a server admin I worked with used was an Apple Xserv RAID. Very easy to implement and not too costly. It scales nicely and since its Java based, can be managed by any OS. So OSX is not needed for the front end management. As others say, offsite if possbile, but again it depends on your scope. 

Are you sure you downloaded the correct version? There might be a specific version meant for server and the version you are trying to install is XP. Also 32bit vs 64bit might make a difference. Maybe you need the full package? $URL$ Or scroll down to the bottom of the following website for some command line switches to try... $URL$ 

You actually wouldn't need to license Ghost to them, just XP. But you do need to buy licenses for the number of computers you are ghosting. My recommendation would be to use Clonezilla. Load the image on a USB drive or thumb drive then when you have to image a computer just pop in the USB drive or thumb drive, pop in the CD, and restore. Very easy, no mounting of drives necessary, and should be very quick. 

I'm thinking something to do with the network or Internet for this issue since you say CPU, Mem, and Page don't seem active... Check your Windows Update settings for your server and home user on XP. I notice on my system at home that if updates are set to automatically download that when they do download sometimes the system really lags until those downloads finish. If that doesn't seem to help, check for NIC activity. I'm not sure what a good method for doing this would be. You can run Performance Monitoring and when the system seems slow check NIC activity in that. If you see spikes during lag times, you could then do a capture with Wireshark to see what traffic is going out/in of that server. If both of those don't seem to help, I'm not sure what else you could check for. Faulty hardware somewhere along the line would be my next guess.
