You can check the header of the HTTP connection. If the header containg the field the content is gzipped (see also wikipedia and W3C HTTP protocol). 

There is simply no way to use a passive adapter as DVI-D/Display Port/HDMI are a complete other technology than VGA. VGA uses analogue signals whereas DVI-D/Display Port/HDMI use digital signals. DVI-I uses also analogue signals therefore you can have a passive adapter from DVI-I to VGA. 

it should be possible to access your folder. You can only change into a folder when you have the appropriate execute permission for it. 

Update To explain things a bit more (as mentioned by duDE): The join used in the question is called equi-join, this means that only rows in are selected that also exists in (and vice versa). The outer join selects all rows contained in and joins all matching rows from . If does not contain a matching row then is returned for all columns. 

The is no simple answer as it depends on the updates made. If the kernel had a serious security problem then it is good to restart as soon as possible. If the kernel had only minor fixes then the restart could be postponed. If you guarantee an availability > 99.9% then you will almost always have a clustered system where you can reboot the nodes one by one without interrupting the service. So you reboot the first system and reatach it to the cluster. Then the second and so on. Then the service will never become unavailable. 

This is not (easily) possible with linux as some files are written to the home directory (e.g. or ). You can create a new group and assign this group to the users that only read files. Then give the file permission to the files and assign the created greoup to the files. So the users can only read the files. Also you can give the permission and assign the group to all directories so that the users may not write files into directories. 

When using the Remote Display feature you have to connect to the host on port 5000 and not to the guest. So try to connect to the host on port 5000. Therefore the networksetup of the guest (wheter bridged or not) does not matter. 

I've been tasked with creating a VM with Windows 3.0 and Office 3.0 on it. I have the install disks for Windows and Office but not for DOS. Do I need to have DOS installed first to install Windows 3.1? 

I have an HP Mini 110 with Splashtop OS as an 'instant on' OS. I've updated to the newest version which has a Chromium browser...and not too much else You know what would be really cool? The newest Chromium/Chrome OS build on there instead Can someone in the know tel me if this is even possible? (just to be clear, I don't want to put Chrome OS on my hard drive or boot to a USB drive. I want Chrome OS installed in the same place that Splashtop is installed.) 

So I've found something that works extremely well. klip.me is a bookmarklet and Chrome extension that sends the text and pictures on what ever page you're on to your kindle. It's simple and quick. The Chrome extension is way better than the bookmarklet, though. Good for people who use Chrome all the time, not so good for people who use Firefox all the time (like me!). The bookmarklet works, but it's spotty at times. I find myself using the 'view this page in Chrome' add-on for Firefox and sending the page from Chrome. 

I can send a bunch of documents as attachments and have Amazon convert these documents and send them to my Kindle. I do it all the time for .doc and .pdf files. But what if there's a long email or article I want to read on my Kindle? I don't want to have to open up Word, copy the article text to the document, save it, open up gmail, attach the .doc to the email, send it to the correct address, wait.... Is there a way that I can automate this process? Is there a 'Read It Later' style bookmarklet or something that I can just click to send to my Kindle? 

This was a theme issue. The user had changed his Windows 7 theme and broke those images. I noticed that an MSE popup was not the color that it should have been and the sticky notes that he had on his desktop were white in the middle when they should have been yellow all the way through. I set the theme back to Windows 7 (the default) and it fixed the issue. I don't know what happened when he changed it back, but ultimately the theme was the issue I don't have any idea why 

What should I do now? I am completely out of ideas. (I have also tried BOOTICE, but that did nothing too) 

Your key is actually stored in the BIOS. But don't go looking for it in there. Since microsoft decided to remove the stickers at the bottom of your laptop, 

The " that are included are required Option 2 also fixes your issue with Microsoft Edge, Cortana, etc. Hopefully one of the options worked for you! 

Your only choice will be to use a software to retrieve the missing key. Download this software and unzip the software, after opening try searching for it with the MSDM option checked, 

I've decided to upgrade to Windows 10 on my Dell Optiplex 760, but the problem is when I boot from the USB, nothing happens. This is also the same on my laptop which is where I downloaded the iso from Microsoft's Insider Build page, I have tried both arch's (x86 and x64) and both won't boot from my desktop. What should I do? Specs: Dell Optiplex 760 Intel Core2 Duo (64 Bit Processor) nVidia GeForce 210 1GB DDR3 2GB DDR2 RAM Intel Virtulisation Technology (VT-d / VT-x) CD/DVD RW Drive 

These DNSUnlocker things are everywhere on every page on my PC. I don't even know how it even got on my system. After finding it in control panel and uninstalling it, it seems to still terrorize my pc, with most words becoming links for "ads" which is really annoying when trying to click play on one of my games. I won't be able to add images because the images button has been taken over by the adware. How can I stop this "DNS Unlocker" adware from messing up my PC? 

Go to run (Windows + r) type regedit and press enter. click ok when notification window prompt. Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER>Software>Microsoft>Windows>CurrentVersion>Explorer>Advanced Create a Dword (32BIT) value by right clicking and selecting New > Dword (32bit) with the name ‘EnableXamlStartMenu’. Give it value 0 Log off and login again. 

It is possible, but you need to put the iso onto a usb disk. (4GB or more, I reccomend 8GB just in case) Now download the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool and install it, afterwards open it and select the ISO file, click USB then let it do its job. Once it says its completed, go to Computer (Or this pc) and click your USB. Then navigate to the sources folder and delete the file. When you load your windows 10 installer from usb, it will show all windows installations! 

I have a user that just bought a brand new MacBook Air and put Office for Mac on it. He's trying to connect to our Exchange server where he has a ~17.5 GB mailbox. The inbox starts downloading, gets to 699 items with 199 unread and Outlook crashes. Does Outlook for Mac just not like huge mailboxes? Also, are .ost files stored on the Mac like they are in Windows? 

I have a new hard drive, put Windows 7 on it and want to get all the files off of my old hard drive. I put in my old hard drive as a slave drive. I can see the files but when I try to move 'em, it tells me that I'm not the owner of the file. I try to take ownership of the file and it doesn't work (it doesn't tell me that I can't take ownership of it, it goes through, just gives me the same error when I try and open the file again). I've tried modding the permissions, no dice. Anything else I can try? 

I gave myself full access permissions to a number of people's mailboxes to move mail from an old system into their new mailboxes. I went to file>info>account settings and added the other mailboxes manually. After I was done with it, I went through the same steps to remove the mailboxes manually. However, the folders do not disappear from the Navigation Pane! I've tried right-clicking and deleting the folder; it tells me that I need to remove the mailbox in the 'account settings' options. I go back into 'account settings' and the mailboxes I want to remove are not there. When I try to click the mailbox to view the mail, it tells me that I don't have access to the mailbox (I removed full access permissions when I was done moving the mail). Am I missing something? How do I remove the mailbox from my Navigation Pane? 

I have two of the exact same 2TB external HDDs. I copied a bunch of information to one of them and then copied everything from the first to the second HDD and now their sitting at different amounts of free space. The copy job completed without error and there are no obvious large hidden files lying around. First question is: how can this happen? I used robocopy so I know I brought over all hidden files and everything Second question is: is there anything I can use to make sure both HDDs have exactly the same information on them? 

When the content (e.g. a document or an Excel sheet) is created on the fly the size cannot be known before. In this cases the server cannot send you the size of the download before and the brower cannot display the total size. 

To access a folder like you want to access it you need the permission (execute) for the directory. So if you change the premissions with 

You cannot directly modify a file inside a or file. To modify a file inside a compresed file you have to extract the file, modify it and then create a new compressed file with the modified file. It is pssible that a program does this transprently for you so that it seems that you directly modify the file in the compressed file. This extract, modify, compress scheme is needed as the compressed file depends on all the content. You cannot simply change a file (with different size) inside a compressed file as all pointers in the compressed file must be adjused in this case (also you have to move the other files in the copressed file which is programmatically copying the content to a new file). 

The answer to this question highly depends on the laptop you own. And the answer to this has two parts: BIOS and hardware. The BIOS reports the number of drives it can handle which is 2. This is because the first HDD controller could handle 2 drives and therefore the BIOS up to date can also handle 2 drives (for compatibility reasons). In laptop it depends on the size if you can house 2 HDDs. Most laptops with 15" or less have only 1 HDD bay whereas some larger latops could house 2 HDDs (e.g. I've a Dell Inspiron 1720 which houses 2 HDDs). 

You confuse automount with autorun. Automount is basically not harmfull as it only connects the device with your computer. This is also done in Windows (when the drive letter occurs it is mounted automatically). In Windows automount is activated always (without hacks it cannot be deactivated) where in Linux you have an easy choice. What is dangerous is autorun. This is dangerous on Windows and on Linux as it can run unwanted scripts. Therefore I would suggest to turn it off. 

Your USB has most likely become corrupt. Open CMD and type in when CMD shows in the output type in locate your 64MB USB drive. Mostly USB's are recongised as disk 2, BUT PLEASE CHECK THIS OR YOU MAY LOSE IMPORTANT DATA! type in WARNING: PLEASE MAKE SURE IT HAS SELECTED THE USB AND NOT A PARTITION ON YOUR HARD DRIVE! when it outputs type Wait for the process to finish. Close DISKPART and press WIN+R and type in Check to see if the full 4GB is there (In windows' case, 3.7GB*) If it is, right click the partition and select "New Simple Volume" Follow the steps and select "Quick Format" You should now have your full 4GB Back. *Windows technically does not use Gigabytes, but instead Gibibytes. Learn more here: EDIT: If it does not even let you run CLEAN, your USB drive has most likely triggered the read-only function in the firmware, which is irreversable What is a Gibibyte? 

This is a Toshiba C50B14D, today when trying to power it on it refused to, the power light would illuminate, the fan would spin very quietly, then it would shut off. No display or anything. I tried the usual Toshiba diagnostic steps all the forums are talking about, but none of them have worked. I tried powering it on with the power cord and no battery, it does the same but the charging indicator will flick off then on again. Is the main board or any other component dead? I'm not sure as it doesn't have error codes like Hp laptops do. 

Right click on your start menu button. click on search. type power shell. right click on power shell from search results. click on run as administrator. Execute below code : 

System restore didn't have anything, system image didn't have anything, and startup repair was just useless. It just couldn't Identify the problem. This is a really serious issue as I cannot even get into my PC. Can someone help with these questions: 

So I just refreshed my windows 10 Pc. (Keeps all my files) but now at the boot screen I'm stuck with this: 

I want people to login to my sky router like you do in cafes and some places with free wifi. (e.g Wifi powered by the cloud) I want to do this as I would like to put web restrictions on different users. For example one account (Named "foo") gets access to everything. But the other account (Named "foo2") only gets access to a quarter of things.
