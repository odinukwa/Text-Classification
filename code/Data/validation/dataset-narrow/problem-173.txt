simple example (N = network section H = host section) NNN | HHH HHH HHH Legacy Class A 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (address range) /8 (cidre = 255.0.0.0 - subnet mask = 0.255.255.255 - wild card (only used when configuring certain routing protocols e.g. OSPF and EIGRP) NNN NNN | HHH HHH Legacy Class B 172.16.000.000 to 172.31.255.255 (address range) / 16 (cider = 255.255.0.0 - subnet mask = 0.0.255.255 - wild card mask) NNN NNN NNN | HHH Legacy Class C 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (address range) /24 (cidre = 255.255.255.0 - subnet mask = 0.0.0.255 wild card mask) wikipedia has good articles on both subnet masks and wild card masks These (address if not in totality due to VLSM (variable length subnet masks) are still used by network admins, to help predetermine the size of network which they are dealing with. I hope this answers question 1 of 3 which you asked. as for question 2: each router is different, there should be no reason you could not change what address range it distributes (as long as it co insides with the above range). however with out the actual router make and model I can not advice up on that. as for question 3. every pc typically will get their IP address from the router via protocol called DCHP, when your PC is connect to a network it will send a DHCP request using UDP, to ask for a IP address. If a DCHP server hears this request and has address left in its pool then it will temporally reserve an address and offer this address to the client in this case the PC. the DCHP address pool is configured upon what the addressing system has been set to. e.g. 192.168.0.0 /24 then it will release an address between the ranges of 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254 (inclusive) however they may be (almost certainly) "reserved addresses" which are address which should not be sent via DCHP, these are typically the address of any routers (default gateway), manages switches and servers which are on the network. Hope this helps TLDR; 

As you can see this is a GNS3 lab I put together. I have an ASN#99 with 2(two) prefixes (99.1.1.0/24 and 111.1.1.0/24). I also have two ISP neighboring routers. Tier3-1 and Tier3-2. I am trying to get from Tier1's perspective, the best path for 99.1.1.0/24 prefix is through Tier3-1 and the best paht for prefix 111.1.1.0/24 prefix is through Tier3-2. Keep in mind, I cannot touch Tier3-1 or Tier3-2. This is probably something simple I am missing. Appreciate everyones help. 

I am setting up a ISPEC tunnel between a Linux System running Openswan and a Cisco ASA 5505. The strange thing is, the tunnel comes up I believe (based on the screenshots below), but I can't get traffic to traverse. I am wondering if it is an issue with the LAN being a Looopback interface on the Openswan system. In summary ASA side(2.2.2.2) has LAN 192.168.0.0/24 and Openswan side(1.1.1.1) has LAN 172.16.255.1/32 which is a loopback interface on the Openwan system. I am getting the following error and am fairly confident it has something to do with this line: 

Hope that my answer will clear what you are asking: first of all lets talk about the speed test and what does it actually mean. When you do any speed test from any pc at your network (recommended to do the test directly from the ISP router)well,it shows the bit rate for the download direction that can be transferred from the pinged server to your pc and the upload speed will show you the bit rate from your pc to the pinged server. and when you do the speed test ,you are not actually using this data rate ,you are only sending the ping message and getting the response. but the real usage will happen when your pc and the other pcs in your network will try to actually download/upload data from/to specific web server. 

I'm not sure why this is happening, but I have a Cisco ASA peering with a Forigate to create VPN Site-to-Site Tunnel. The odd thing is I see this in ASDM, the Cisco ASA is creating two(2) identical tunnel IDs? Furthermore, bringing up the Tunnel will only work if a host on the Cisco ASA network initiates a connection through the Tunnel, not the other way around. 

Testing in a lab...I have a VLAN directly attached to a Cisco ASA 5520 that contains host machines who use IPs from a public address space, 11.11.11.0/26 for example. The ASA has two interfaces this dmz interface containing the hosts on the 11.11.11.0/26 and an outside interface containing a /30 peering point to an ASR running BGP etc. Is there a way to configure the ASA to allow connectivity to and from this 11.11.11.0/26 without having to put in NAT statements since both interfaces are two different security-levels? 

the default gateway address comes from the old class-full addressing system it should be possible look in your router's setting the address come from a protocol called DCHP 

like user1801810 said 192.168.xxx.xxx /24 (255.255.255.0) is a class C private address (this means that it can be used by anyone, on a private network such as a home or a office) this traditonally gave 254 usable address e.g. 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254 where 192.168.0.0 was the network address (mainly requried for DCHP (Dynamic Contol Host Protocol)(what assigns your IP addresses)). And 192.168.0.255 is your broadcast address. Where through the usage of VLSM (Variable length subnet masks), the class-full system is all but obsolete, the base addressing scheme e.g. 

I think Cisco was referring to the interesting traffic is automatically put into a GRE formed tunnel. Which is different than we normally think of when making a GRE tunnel. Usually it has to do with routing and you need a virtual interface to have an IP address so you have something from R1 to push routes to R2. Correct, in WCCP you don't have to specify an IP address for the GRE interface wccp0. Most of the times I've see it set to the same as the physical interface so you can run squid on that IP address only. As long as you have ip_forward=1 the packet is already decapsulated and in the wccp0 virtual interface. You can verify this by doing a tcpdump -i wccp -vvv and you will see stuff. The trick here is WCCP happens after the routing process, which is usually how we use GRE. We are skipping the Tunnel interface IP part because we are using an ACL on the Cisco side, and Squid WCCP process gets the packet since it's automatically decapsulated when it arrives. Squid isn't a router so we don't need a Tunnel interface IP for next-hop statements...the decapsulated packet is ready for processing.... WCCP SSL redirection using Squid3.4+ and Cisco ASA 

**Why each and every single port on Layer 2 switches need to have it's own MAC address? This question has been asked and answered with each has it's own MAC and one of the purposes was STP protocol use. My question is that are these mac addresses used for etherchannel load balancing whenever the portchannel configured to load balance based on src-dst mac?is the source mac in cisco command indicating to the port mac address? Thanks, Ethem 

16-bit ASNs and 32-bit ASNs are interoperable. You do not have to renumber. If you do not plan to expand your network it is sufficient to check that your tools still work when you enter a 32-bit ASN. If you are using the latest equipment and software and your upstream provider supports 32-bit ASNs, apply for a 32-bit ASN. If you are using older equipment and software, apply for a 16-bit ASN. 

I have a Twice NAT routing question. How do I forward an IP packet based on the pre-translated destination? Right now I have conflicting subnets between two sites which is why I am doing the Twice NAT. However, I believe the Cisco ASA is routing based on the post-translated address and therefore not forwarding the packet in the correct direction. Here's my code 

However cisco complains the route already exists, even though it is for the outside interface. I really don't like doing it this way, however I can't seem to find a way to have the Cisco ASA forward the packet based on the pre-nat destination.

as Ron mentioned before there is no common network between your routers and every single interface is on a separate network and the reason is that the wild card mask that you have configured on each of these interfaces which give you the option to have interfaces on the same network only using the 1st octet (.255) 2nd octet (.1)cannot be changed. You can fix that by using a different wild card mask such 0.0.8.255 and here the ping can work and all your interfaces will be on the same network but you will be losing the benefit of the router which is separating between 2 different networks Better practice is to change the IP addresses on the interfaces and have both of the connected interfaces to be on the same network. 

I am trying to figure out if there is a way to ping from a Cisco IP Phone? Specifically a 7945G running SCCP45.9-4-2SR1-1S ? I have successfully gained SSH access to the CLI of the phone, however I don't see a ping command? 

interesting traceroute I am getting thru a firewall where we are NAT'ing both Source and Destination. I am wondering if it is possible to get this to work. We are trying to set up a traceroute monitor to trace routes out on the far end of our firewall. We are using Nagios to report back if the last hop changes to gives us an idea of any fluctuations. I have the Nagios script working internally, however when I cross to a Host on the far end of the Firewall. I am receiving werid info back from the trace route command. I've tried both ICMP and TCP traceroutes. Here is what I am getting.
