The SDcard seems fake?! I cannot believe this, because I thought I've been using its 26GB capacity in the past. Is there anyone can share some wisdom on this issue? 

I used the netbootin to generate a Mint 17.1 live USB on a EFI kubuntu system. It can be boot in computer with UEFI mode. However, if I change to legacy mode, the live USB cannot boot at all. Is there any way to create a legacy mode compatible live USB? 

I have some DN which does not have entry in DNS server x.x.x.x can only be resolved by server y.y.y.y and some DN will be wrong in y.y.y.y but correct in x.x.x.x. In traditional linux I just put 2 lines in . 

This directs all outgoing traffics through 10.0.0.1 which is the VPN gateway. But I want route all traffic through local gateway 192.168.1.1 except certain address for example 172.217.26.36. I try to delete the . Then try to add a new entry: 

I just found out. If you download several files (any file, text, image, binary) as zip from google drive. Then unpack it with Ark locally. All the files in that folder will automatically get exec permission ... This is very dangerous. Any idea what is wrong here? I try to compress exactly same files into zip and unpack with Ark. The behaviour is normal. I try to unzip the downloaded zip file in terminal with . It also behave normally. 

However, the DNS lookup does not follow the order I give. Since the y.y.y.y is a local server it always response faster, dnsmasq always use response from y.y.y.y and never use response from x.x.x.x. Is there anyway that I can enfore the lookup order in dnsmasq? I am aware I could do something like in dnsmasq.conf. However, in ubuntu 14.04 there is no such file and the resolv.conf is automatically generated. [update] I add "strict-order" to . Restart the network and networkmanager, it has no effect so far. the dnsmasq command run by networkmnager is like this: 

In this way, program will first send request to x.x.x.x. If it does not have that entry it will fall back to y.y.y.y. Thus everything will be fine. The modern linux distro normally use dnsmasq. I can still give multiple DNS server by network manager. show this: 

Flashing the BIOS If that does not fix the problem, you can try flashing your BIOS. To flash you follow the simple instructions in the user manual on page 85. Assuming an Intel Core i5 CPU and model Q502LA You can download the BIOS VERSION 207 here. 

This is pretty simple to do using the Command Line Utility. You don't have to download any software or anything at all for that matter. You basically have to clean, create partition, make it active, format it (make sure you don't have any important data, as it will be deleted), and assign it. Just follow this guide step by step here. 

If it is not the hosts file or an adware on your computer as pointed out by @pgr, it could possibly be your DNS server. If you're in a country which blocks Google's DNS name, your ought to try changing your DNS server to Google's Public DNS Server. It might be a bit slower than your local DNS servers but will ensure you almost 100% uptime and resolves to the correct servers. You can change your DNS Servers via your network adapter. 

Flashing the BIOS If resetting the CMOS settings did not work and your BIOS version is below 1.80 (which it is), you can try flashing your BIOS. This option should be used as the last resort after you have tried everything possible. Download the BIOS update from here. Place it on a USB and use the Instant Flash tool in the BIOS to proceed. Follow the guide in the manual on Page 52 for more details and information. Instant Flash 

So, If you did not format your hard drive and it has not been 28 days since you have installed Windows 8.1, you're in luck. You can simply go ahead and use the automatic diagnostic tool (provided in the link) which will retrieve your personal data and put it back in place. If you don't want that, you can go ahead and recover the bookmarks manually. Every browser works differently in terms of bookmark saving location and importing options so I'll list the three most popular Windows browsers and how to recover each of their bookmarks. Google Chrome 

Right click desktop and select the AMD Catalyst Control Center option. Common Display Tasks > Rotate Desktop Select your monitor and change it to Landscape (or whichever orientation you prefer). 

You could restore to a system restore point if they were confirgured to save and you have a save point that's before the virus infection, but not too old as to be painful. 

Of course, if you're going to go to the trouble of recompiling alpine you may just want to change the checkpoint code to write after each change, but be warned that whatever you do, it's likely to result in decreased performance if you increase checkpointing frequency. One more thing to note - you can see when checkpoints occur currently by turning on the option . Two asterisks will appear when it is saving to disk. 

Ultimately if none of these work you last option is to remove the drive and try and get it out once it's outside the laptop. 

The best way to do this is with Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. This allows you to create custom keyboard layouts, which are then installed and can be set as the system keyboard layout. It'd be pretty easy to create a layout with the Alt and Windows keys switched, and this method has the advantage of residing much lower in the OS than a 3rd party tool or Hotkey program. This means that when you hit Alt, the OS sees it as LWindows (and of course vice versa). This is going to be more reliable than overriding the default behaviour of a system key, which AutoHotKey seems to offer. 

Color consistency is a headache - it is almost certain that there is no way to get this to appear the same on all machines and all browsers (even assuming calibration!). But we can try our best. Embedding ICC profiles, if they are honoured, gives you control over the color space used to display the image and can guarantee color consistency. Your problem is occurring because without a profile, Safari renders colour in monitor color-gamut rather than sRGB. The only reason it looks fine on the first Mac is bcause the monitor color-gamut just happens to match sRGB. You're using CSS styles with RGB codes to set the background color. The CSS3 standard proposes a color-profile property that would let you include a color profile to control how this background colour is rendered, but unfortunately almost no browsers yet implement this. Using a tagged image containing a color profile as your background (and eg tiling) instead of CSS would enable you to ensure consistency across all browsers that honour ICC profile tags in images. Unfortunately this is not all browsers (eg IE doesn't), hence my synopsis at the start that there's no guarantee you can ever get consistency everywhere. I recommend that you create a tiny image using the desired color, tag it with an sRGB profile, and use this as your background. This should get you consistency almost everyhwhere (since IE/Windows assumes sRGB for everything anyway). 

First of all try Pressing these key combinations. If that works, you're set! If not, the easiest way to do this is through the Windows built-in Screen Resolution Control Panel Window. Otherwise the graphics card control panel can be used as well. By the hotkey (CTRL+ALT+Arrow), I can tell that you either have Intel or NVIDIA graphics card and its corresponding software. All these methods are explained in detail below. Right click your desktop to determine which graphics card you have. If you have an Intel graphics card, there will be a context menu displaying Graphics Properties. If you have a NVIDIA grpahics card, there will be a context menu displaying NVIDIA Control Panel. If you have an AMD grpahics card, there will be a context menu displaying AMD Catalyst Control Center. Windows Built-In Feature 

If that doesn't work, also try removing/uninstalling these features if you installed them through the MB CD: 

Navigate to: Copy the Favorites folder and paste it on the desktop. Navigate to your current user folder: Delete your Favorites folder (WARNING: This will delete ALL your current favorites) Cut and Paste the Favorites folder from your desktop to this directory (). 

Resetting the CMOS Settings If disabling fast boot and the utilities I described in the previous section did not work, I would recommend clearing your CMOS settings by resetting the jumper cap on the motherboard. 

Outlook should open. Try pasting in any data and if the data is pasting in without failure, one of your add-ins is the culprit. You can disable the add-ins one-by-one to find out which one is causing this problem. Description of what the safe:3 switch does: 

Test and see if the problem persists. If it does, you can try deleting your user profile. Follow this simple guide from the Google support page. 

Try and change the Power Option settings for the "When I close the Lid:" to Do Nothing under the Plugged in Category. 

Start Chrome and Open the Chrome Menu Go to Settings > Extensions (On the left hand side) Delete all of the extensions that you haven't installed by pressing the trash button on the right. 

Are you sure it is a new laptop? Either way, I would go with the first option since it would be running at a higher speed and after 4 GB of ram it doesn't really help that much. If you need that extra RAM (ex. if you run a lot of high-end programs simultaneously) then the second option is fine but as I pointed out in the comments it will decrease the speed. It just depends on what you want to do. For normal operations such as browsing and running MS office software, and Photoshop, 4gb of ram is fine. 

In kubuntu, the chromium browser put the usr/pwd entries in a wrong place of the kwallet. It put them into . It cannot be displayed at all. I can export the data into xml. However, it is coded with base64 armor. How can I get those logins back to plain text now? The is empty now which does not have any logins. 

with the clone tile, I can only achieve the size increasing with a parameter row (400%), col (100%). However, I cannot find out how to increase the separation like this. 

I haven't turned on the windows 7 box for about 9 months. When I try to check the updates, it is supper slow. So I turned of the update other Microsoft product option in . After about 40hours calculation the windows update finally figured out all updates it required. After installed all updates, I reboot the computer. Everything seems fine. However, when I click the in . It directed me to this url: $URL$ instead of: 

I had a nvidia GPU and onboard graphic card (ivy bridge). Is it possible to enable both cards in ubuntu? When I do CUDA computing I would like to use the onboard graphic card to handle X-display and nvidia GPU to dedicate on computing. But when I need the openGL support I would like to switch back to use the GPU. Is there any way we can do this? updates 

I try to add the debian sid source on ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I have already installed debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring. 

So the intel graphic is there. I tried the prime-select intel, it applied several alternative config, but nothing changed. Then I reboot the machine, it stuck at black screen. I then disabled the intel graphic in bios, boot back. the prime-select tell me nvidia profile is in use. I enable the intel graphic again. Boot back, it still said it is nvidia in use. I also noticed in x-server setting I never have the prime profile option. Do I need to reboot after switch to intel graphics? updates 1 I finally dig into dmesg.log then I find out: 

but I cannot find hybrid-detect any where. The system seems using gpu-manager. But it still has bugs: "update-alternatives: error: no alternatives for x86_64-linux-gnu_gfxcore_conf" and "/etc/modprobe.d is not a file" 

You can get 'Open With' in the context menu for any file by simply holding the Shift key as you right click. If Shift + right click doesn't work, Shift + F10 may work. To get 'Edit' in the context menu you need to edit the registry. Open up regedit and browse to . Create a new key called , then create a new key under that called . Edit the default value of the command key to be . 

This is on the radar of the Panorama team, but has not been implemented, either directly in Panorama or in a third-party add-on. I am experiencing the same problem - I typically have 80+ tabs in ~10 groups, which are nicely (manually) arranged so as to prevent the tabs being stacked. Creating a new group gets really fiddly though, as if I put it over the top of (or even near) an existing group it causes the groups to 'auto arrange', usually very badly, undoing all my careful arrangement. Auto-arrange is something that would be theoretically possible to create as an add-on. This problem, and the idea of an add-on, sees some discussion here: $URL$ 

then shrink the log file to free drive space. Note I've assumed MS SQL. You will need an ongoing strategy to prevent this from happening again. Depending on your application and level of laissez-faire, you may want to: 

A much simpler and more sensible solution: don't defrag it daily. It's highly unlikely that it needs it. What makes you think that it needs defragging daily is required? Most modern filesystems don't get fragged very quickly or easily, and a defrag will essentially reduce fragmentation to an aboslute minimum, so doing it again two days later is unlikely to do much unless you have some serious hardware issues. If it's eg performance issues that are making you think defrag is needed what makes you so sure they're being caused by FS fragmentation? 

I used to have this router and had troubles with it dropping wireless connections frequently. Some things that will improve your situation: Check if there are firmware updates available and install them if so. As jack said, set your wireless channel to one that isn't used much. He didn't mention how to choose what this is though. Best way is to use NetStumbler which will show you what channels are used by other networks, and the signal-to-noise on each channel. It's also likely that you don;t need to reset your router to fix the described state above - does selecting 'Repair Connection' fix things? Finally, it may be worth setting up and Alternate Configuration in TCP/IP properties of your wifi card. This is a fallback IP/gateway/DNS in case DHCP failes, whcich is one of the possible causes of the 'limited connectivity' error
