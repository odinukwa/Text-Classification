If you don't have a WP7 and only a desktop computer the best solution is to use the WP7 Emulator. You can find more informations here: $URL$ If you have installed the latest version of XNA, the WP7 emulator is installed at the same time. If you don't have it, you can get it from here: $URL$ You can also read this post on AppHub, someone else had had the same problem as you: $URL$ 

The smallest increment you can do on a float in C# and have a significant value to be different from 0 is float.Epsilon. From MSDN Single.Epsilon 

I'm trying to implement an axis-aligned bounding box with center/half-size instead of min/max. And I have some problems when it comes to create a method to detect if the aabb is visible or not. I try to do the same as on this website at "Method 5": $URL$ I'm trying to implement this formula: 

I've just tried to draw it normally and it appears at the center of the scene. After that, i don't know what to do to make it appears at the bottom left of the screen regardless of where the camera looks, as if that was part of the UI. 3DSMax has the same thing at the bottom left of each frame. 

Yes GLUT is obsolete and not under developement since 1998 with the release of the 3.7 version. From French Wikipedia: 

_signPlane is an array of Vector3 using the following formula and applied for each plane once per frame when the frustum is updated: 

To my knowledge the best project i have seen is Burger Engine. jst download the code and check how well they have implemented.The whole thing is data-driven from xml and they used very well entity based architecture.worth looking at it. $URL$ 

I gave a quick try(infact took some time to get used to shader lab syntax ;) as i was trying after quite some time). Let me know if this shader works for you. Basically checking the frag color by sign value of dot product of view direction and normal of the vertex. Btw, I set the culling to off. Thanks for letting me trying this out. Very happy with the output ^_^ . I'm aware of doing without shader but thought of giving this a try with shader. Sorry for replying abit late to your post. Link : $URL$ Update: Here is the explanation of the code. This is infact how Back-face culling works. The Dot product between The camera view direction and the vertex normal will tell which way the vertex is oriented. Whether its away from camera or towards the camera. Dot product value of those two vectors goes negative if the vectors are away from each other. So , the same math is used to find out which texture we need to show. In the code, I took two texture samples (_FirstTex,_SecondTex) as properties. Vertex Shader 1) First we need to convert vertex co-ordinate which is in object space to Clip Space. 2)Next we use world View space direction(_WorldSpaceCameraPos) provided by unity cg includes(UnityCG.cginc,UnityShaderVariables.cginc) and normalize it. (Infact there is no real importance of normalising here as we just need sign of dot product.) 3)We then need to convert vertex normal to world space.(Please check the comment there for converting to same co-ordinate system). We can do the other way as well(converting view direction to object space). 4)Find the dot product and save the value in color.w to pass it to fragment shader. Fragment Shader: 1)We find out the sign of the dot product value and based on that decide which texel to fetch. 2)Return the texel color. Let me know if you need any further clarification. 

Im making a topdown 2d game, and I've made a decent entity system so far. But I want to do the following with it: I want to have drawing depth, so if a , for instance, tree is above another tree then it should be drawn underneath the other tree. Here is baisicly a picture of what I mean. This is what Im trying to avoid: 

Left: it works good, it goes all the way to the wall (btw the red square is the collision box). Right: The player only goes down that much and leaves a gap inbetween it and the wall (the circle shows the gap) and you can not go down to go all the way to the wall. The movment code: 

Ive made this 'game' where you can fire an aibility (a fire ball for instance) from the player towards the mouse (to the point where the mouse was at the time of casting/fireing/shooting the ball), now Id like to know how I could implement it so that if it reaches its destination that it stops, and also how I could make it travel in the direction of the mouse but for a ciurtant distance only. Here's the code for the fire ball thing: 

(4 being stone and 3 being the stick item) Each slot has its own item variable. So how can I access all of them at the same time? Or even if there is a simpler way to do this. Thank you 

I'm learning OpenGL and really like to know how the interaction with the Graphics card will be. I feel understanding how it was implemented in the Graphics driver, will let me know complete internals of the opengl(With this I can know what stages/factors influence my decisions regarding performance in opengl). Are there any ways for this path to proceed.Does exploring the 'Mesa lib' will help me in this aspect? Am I in the right path? [I posted this question in SOF but it seems here is the right place for this Question.] 

So here you need to understand a VBO like - "It can be able to store the whole vertex attributes". Basically a VBO is a "buffer" that you can bind to any of the vertex info. Answer 1 : Yes (Check the above description) Answer 2: VBO's are usually "faster" than usual vertex lists, as there is no need of pushing the vertex info every frame(if the data is static). Even If the underlying architecture is unified memory architecture, it will have benefits as there is no "overwrite" of data unnecessarily. Answer3 : STATIC_DRAW/DYNAMIC_DRAW are just flags to tell the underlying GPU where to keep the buffers.The underlying GPU will decide where to keep the buffers based on the flags you give.So this should be in mind for better throughput.But, in Unified Memory Architecture(where GPU will be sharing Main RAM),I think it will not make any significant difference. 

Even though i'm completely satisfied with r2d2rigo's answer, I would like to explain how i will visualize about VBO's :D First, Even-though VBO means Vertex Buffer Object, It doesn't mean that it holds only vextex coordinates. 

It seems that the UDK only support iOS for the moment and so there is no way to make it works on Android: $URL$ As you say Dungeon Defenders was built with Unreal Engine and not with the UDK. According to Epic Game some problems such as performance and app size issues on Android prevent them to release an Android version of the UDK. 

When you try to call the Effect property of your ModelMeshPart you get an Effect instance and Effect is the base class for all effect. So you can't cast an Effect instance to a BasicEffect because BasicEffect inherits from Effect. Furthermore you don't need to cast it to a BasicEffect. Your line: 

I'm creating an application which allows the user to manipulate 3D models. I would like to draw 3 axis representing the world coordinate system in 3D in order to give the user an idea where he is. These axis are represented by a 3D model. Now I want these axis to be always shown at the bottom left of the screen. I know how to draw them but not how to project them at specific coordinates on the screen. How can i achieve this? EDIT: I use XNA. The axes have been created with 3DSMax, each axes is a cylinder surmounted by a cone. When I load the 3DSMax file, I get an instance of the Model class. 

it seems you're not the only with this problem : $URL$ This exception occurred because there is a missing folder "testdata" and a file "alphamap.png". This file is used by test classes of Slick. Have you downloaded the full distribution or only the library? When i download the full distribution i can find a testdata folder inside the zip file. You can find it here: $URL$ You can find a link to download the full distribution in the menu at the right of the page. 

Currently i'm working on a sprite system which will have frames which make animations. Usually a sprite contains current position, current frame number to be displayed in the running animation, etc... This is what I mean is STATE. Let's say there are 100 NPC characters in a game which will have different animations running at any time.If we are maintaining the state in Sprite class, we usually create 100 sprites and draw it as each sprite has its own state. But I feel the same thing can be done like this, Imagine, position and animation state is separated from the Sprite class.When ever we want to draw we will just set it and draw the frame at certain position.With this approach there is no need to have 100 sprite instances.We can make the exact above situation with one single sprite instance. For me I feel separating the "state" kills encapsulation.But at the same time it will have a benefit in terms of huge memory! Please give your Pros/Cons on this kind of approach? 

So, here if you see, we are limited not to use memcpy as we need to check each pixel's color validity! 

I was earlier in the same confusion and finally found out there is no proper solution for this. My consideration for Google play was not for ranking but for using the leaderboards and multiplayer features. And again If I go with Google Play Services alone, I miss a-lot with Facebook login. So you decide which has more weightage and pick one of it. If you are targeting only for Android I suggest going alone for Google Play services as most of the users will have an account. I picked Parse.com and implemented my own leaderboards and used Facebook for logging in (as I targeted iOS as well, I see FB has more reach). In between, I tried OpenKit and dropped as its getting closed soon. Now i'm checking NextPeer which is a bit close enough to solve my problem. Will update once I play with NextPeer. Hope this helps! 

What is better way of setting up a map for a java 2D topdown game? Would it be having an ArrayList of tiles, a simple 2D array, a HashMap? (Note: the tiles/blocks or whatever are squared) 

Im making an rpg game and right now I'm working on crafting. I've made a crafting slot class, and an arrayList of that class. I've got 10 of those slots in total, 9 placed in a 3x3 'order' and 1 below (like the minecraft inventory). I want to check if the 9 slots contain some items in a particular way, and if they do to put a item in the 10th slot. I can figure out how to craft stuff, but I don't know how to read all those 9 slots at the same time (btw Im using an enhanced for loop to update and render all of 'em). I figured I would check if the slots contain items in this order 

The blue stuff is water and rivers, the gray in the middle is "the mountains" and such. How could I create such a map design, but a random one through code. If anyone has an idea of how this is done, please tell me, or even link a tutorial if you know a good one. Thanks. 

So Im making a topdown 2d rpg in slick2d and lwjgl 2, and I wanna make a map, but not just random map, something like this: 

If you want to learn basic networking I sugest you watch this tutorial series , (episodes 38 - 59 are about networking). He explains how servers work and such. You can then bend the code towards your needs. 

Check these frameworks I found out related to this architecture... www.burgerengine.com PushButtonEngine Arthemis Framework - $URL$ Having a look at Unity Api. You can find a lot of stuff regarding the Component based architecture. (Will update the list as soon as I find somemore...) Update: 

I haven't worked on pyGame before.But , A quick look on souce code of it, lead me to assume that it is using 'sdl' Blit functions under the hood. Usually Sdl blit will be very faster and optimized so, just make a not of the above points and profile once again! Good luck! *Update:*Setting color key is like adding one extra check when blitting each pixel to the surface.Some thing like this - 

A quick search gave me these two links.On which platform you need? $URL$ [Sample done with ChipMunk] $URL$ [detailed description on usage ] 

From your code I can understand that you might be comparing the floats directly. Comparison will not directly as you think in case of floats. Try checking for the difference and decide whether they are equal or not. Because floating point precision is a problem all the times. Just go through these links which a programmer must know. $URL$ PS: As its tagged XNA, vector2 has floats as attributes. Please complete your question for clear details. Hope this helps. 

I haven't used Corona.It needs a license if you need to publish.Cocos2d on the other hand is really flexible and stable 'graphics' engine right now. I would suggest Cocos2d-x (C++ version) as objective-c version has some performance issues when your update cycle is Overloaded.This performance issues is ONLY because of the message passing System in Objective-C. As others said,You need to depend on the support of 'third party Engine' if any thing NEW comes up!But cocos2d is flexible at that moment! If you are targeting multiple platforms,Cocos2d-X is ready for that as well! Check this link - $URL$
