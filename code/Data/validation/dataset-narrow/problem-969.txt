You could use a token ring configuration, but then you would need a media access unit which performs the same basic function as a router. If you want Ethernet, you would need a switch as bryan said, which again, performs the same basic function as a router. In any case, if you want more than two devices to be connected, then you need some sort of device to route the packets. You may be able to find some sort of esoteric network topology that allows several devices to be connected directly, but I doubt it since that would cause problems if any one of them has a problem, is shut down, etc; that is why you need a separate device. If you only need two, then you can connect them directly with a patch-cable like Kevin suggested, a direct-cable connection like with a serial Interlink cable, or special USB cables. 

Just recently I needed to take screenshots in DOS and looked up some old programs I used way back when as well as some new ones. Among the best were 

There is also a shareware one called Grabber and another freeware one called Capture. A few things should be pointed out: 

Wine aficionado often like to keep their wares between 50-80% humidity. Computers prefer a lower humidity between 30-60%. If the wine cooler supports manually setting the humidity, then sure, it sounds good. If however it is automatic, then it will probably keep the system too humid and puts it at risk for things like electrical problems and rusting. From what I can tell, this model is completely automatic for both humidity and temperature, meaning that it will be optimally set for wine, not a computer. 

As the name implies, it is the system, ie the kernel, so you can not stop or kill it without killing all of windows. Moreover, the System process is like , that is, it contains multiple items, so you would need to figure out which specific component is the one occupying port 80. The concern is that most of the components that run in the System component tend to be drivers and the like, and as such, have high-level access to the system. A webserver does not need such access, so I would be extremely wary because it sounds like a virus or rootkit is running on the system and is providing a web interface. You will want to run some security software to check your system for malware. (From what I can tell, it seems that for some reason, IIS does implant itself in the System instead of a dedicated process like a well behaved program, but if you uninstalled it, then it cannot be the source of the problem. That said, check to make sure that IIS is not still present and/or running.) To find the specific component that is occupying port 80, run Process Explorer and double-click System in the process tree. Look in the Threads tab and sort by Start Address. Now look through the list of drivers and see if any look suspicious. There will be some Windows files as well as driver files for your video, audio, network cards, and such, but you can Google any that do not look familiar. You can check TCPView to monitor any connections to your system. 

My mother needs to print photos of the family, but since photos have 100% coverage, the ink cartridges run out quickly. Buying new cartridges is far too expensive (it would be significantly cheaper to just have them printed at a photo shop). So as an alternative, we are looking at ink refill kits. I have a few questions and concerns about them however: 

A great system inventory tool for DOS is HWiNFO. There is also a Windows version. At one time it was a commercial program, but is now freeware. 

In your specific case, it sounds like a recent problem and an intermittent one at that. Does it usually happen on the same day and/or at the same time? It sounds like some new device that is causing interference when it turns on. Have you installed any new electronic devices or appliances in the past few months? Have you gotten new neighbors or was there any recent construction? 

Do they even work? That is, will there be any significant difference from using a real cartridge? Is it safe? Will I be damaging my printer? (If the ink is poor quality, the cartridge may be ruined, but that seems to be the case anyway since you have to drill a hole in them.) If so, then can the cartridge be refilled over and over again? Are there any compatibility issues? I would think that so long as the colors are correct, ink would be ink (particle and nozzle size notwithstanding), yet some refill kits list specific cartridge models or advertise ink that is "specially formulated for X printers/cartridges". 

Close all Chrome windows Navigate to the parent folder of your user-data directory and rename it to something like or Run Chrome and navigate to some pages (to build up the history a bit) Try editing the address in the Omnibar 

What happens is that if you plug a new drive in, sometimes a BIOS will change the order of the drives or reset the boot device list, so you need to make sure to specify the correct device again. As a result, what is probably happening is that when you plug the bad drive in, the BIOS changes the boot device from the good drive to the new drive, thus causing the boot to block on it. Simply change it back to the good drive. 

If it crashes, then there is something wrong with your Chrome installation. Try updating it or uninstalling and reinstalling a fresh copy. If it does not crash, then the problem is with your user profile. In that case, you can consider deleting your old profile (probably undesirable) and using the new one. If you want to keep the old profile (likely), then delete the new folder and rename the old one back to (consider making a backup copy). Now run Chrome again and clear your history. (If it only happens with some URLs, then open the History page (Ctrl+H), click Edit items... in the top-right corner, and delete just the offending items. 

You should also be able to get rid of it by disabling the floppy drive option in the BIOS. That way the whole controller should be invisible to Windows, even if you reinstall. 

For such BIOSes, you need to separately specify the specific device of that type if there are more than one (eg multiple HDs, multiple CD/DVD drives, etc.): 

It sounds like your problem is reliably reproducible. Try testing the same procedure with an empty/new user profile. 

Yes, does indeed store its settings in in the same path as the executable file. You can copy the settings to another OS by copying the file to the same place as the target file (or just copy both to wherever you want). The only caveat is that if you use a shortcut to run the program, make sure to set the starting directory to that of the executable so that it sees the file in its current-working-directory. 

This usually happens when Chrome thinks that it has data in the cache that is not actually there (I experience this when I clear the browser cache in the OS instead of in Chrome, but it can also happen if the cache is flagged or not updated incorrectly). Refreshing usually fixes it, but if not, then just clear the cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete), then refresh. 

No, 110 is simply the model number of the product. You can choose a specific port yourself. A look through the manual does not really specify a default port, but there are occurrences of port 4000 and port 5001, but it looks like 4000 is the normal one. Therefore, try using the following command: 

No, there is no built-in way to automatically remove a file in ÂµTorrent. Automatically stopping it is the closest you can get. Your best bet is to request a way to automatically remove a torrent once it reaches the specified ratio, making sure to explain that you can already automatically stop torrents anyway, so automatically removing them is no more harmful than that. 

Some capture in ASCII mode (ie, create text/ANSI files) while others capture graphics (ie, create JPG/BMP) files. (Either way, you can convert the results manually.) They may not work depending on the screen. Usually they work by installing a TSR to intercept screen writes. That means that something that is output via direct hardware writes cannot be captured unless the software has the ability to read the graphics card's buffer/memory. 

This part sounds like your BIOS is changing the boot device without your realizing it. Some BIOSes allow you to specify a drive by its position in the hard-drive list as below (eg HDD-1, HDD-2, etc.): 

Have you tried the Synch function? Wrench->Options->Personal Stuff->Sync->Set up synch. Then you can select to include your extensions. 

Chrome uses a per-process model which means that for each tab (or group of related tabs), it uses a separate process instead of a separate thread. That basically means that each tab is a separate running program. That way, if any crash, they go down by themselves instead of taking down the whole browser (it does the same thing for plugs and most extensions). This has its obvious benefits (the sandboxing being the primary one), but of course it also has disadvantages like the fact that each one has memory overhead, which means that Chrome uses more RAM overall for the same set of open pages than browsers that do not use a per-process model (other browsers have started moving toward this method since Chrome was released). As you have noted, the per-process rule does not necessarily mean that every tab gets its own process. It depends on how the page was opened. Using open in new tab or open in new window opens the page/link in the same process as the parent, but open in incognito window opens it in a new process as do the new tab and new window commands. Another reason that pages take up a lot of RAM is that these days, most web pages include lots of JavaScript and Flash which make them both CPU and RAM heavy (which also means that older systems cannot browse the Internet that comfortably, so there is no longer such thing as a "used, old, but good-for-browsing system"). Worse, plugins and extensions (and possibly even Chrome itself) could leak memory after a while, increasing the memory usage in time. 

Unfortunately there is no (known/easy) way to see the per-page memory usage. The closest way is to press Shift+Esc or right-click the tab strip and select Task Manager to see the per-process memory usage. One thing you can try is to open each page in a new process (using one of the aforementioned methods) and then compare. 

Unfortunately, Chrome does not (yet?) include a built-in (read easy, practical) way to alter the actual shape or size of the interface elements. Themes only allow you to set textures and colors, which is why if you look at available themes, they all have the same sizes and shapes. I would imagine that there are others who have asked about it, but if so, I cannot seem to filter out the relevant issues (though chances are good that they have been unceremoniously closed anyway). 

That folder is where Windows stores Windows Updates. It is generally safe to delete its contents so long as you have no pending updates. That is, if you have not performed any recent updates or at least have made sure to reboot and complete any recent updates, then you can delete them.
