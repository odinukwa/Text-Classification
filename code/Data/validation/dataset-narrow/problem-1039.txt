It is supposed to be a perfect grid with straight lines. As you can see, it's not (what's printed is blurred, the picture is not out of focus). If you click the image to view it not scaled down, you will notice that certain lines on the grid even split in two and then merge back together. On the left, where it says "PGBK", you can see what I mean by blurry text. All the other cartridges (C, M, Y and BK) do not have this problem. So far I tried: 

So using a short but difficult password is just counter-productive. It's more difficult to remember and less secure. Use a simple but long phrase. 

When you activate it, it will display how much money you are paying per hour, and how much money you have left. When you run out of money you throw it away and buy a new one. That's a hardware device that is in your hands. By definition, it is absolutely possible to "hack" it so that you have infinite money. But hey, no one does it! So the "DRM" is working in this case. Other examples of DRM-like technologies are cash: you can in theory make fake bills that are exactly the same as real bills. It's just extremely difficult. And the list goes on: passports, IDs, etc. So the goal is not to make it impossible, it's to make it difficult, and in this case DRM does work. 

When I open a file in Office (from SharePoint), this takes a while and shows a progress dialog. When I then open a second file, this blocks the Office program (e.g. PowerPoint or Word), as the dialog box prevents Office from loading the second file, showing 'PowerPoint can't do this because a dialog box is open. Please close the dialog box to continue' (see picture below) This is silly as the only option I have is to click 'OK' and it continues loading, however can be annoying as sometimes this dialog box is hidden. How can I prevent Office programs to block when it's opening two files simultaneously? I've looked online but could only find issues related to security settings, however this is related to slow loading, not security. 

EXIF is a format to add metadata to files (mostly pictures), JPEG is a lossy image format, for storing photographs. I think reading the Wikipedia articles should clear things up, the two things are related but not really comparable. 

It actually does work up to a certain degree. The goal of DRM is not to prevent a person to run/copy the software, but to make it more difficult and annoying to do so. If there isn't a crack yet then you will have to reverse engineer the protection mechanism and create one. Most people don't know how to do it, and most of the people who do find the process too annoying and prefer just paying for the software. If there is a crack, all the people who download it risk getting infected by a trojan or virus. The real world is full of protection mechanisms similar to DRM. For example in my city they sell a $50 device to pay parking fees: 

When I shut down my PC I usually have roughly 50 application instances open with unsaved pending changes, and roughly 100-150 that can be closed immediately. Before Windows 8 shutting down the PC started closing the applications and whenever it encountered one with a pending save it showed me the save dialog to which I had very little time to respond, after which I was forced to either terminate the process or abort the shutdown. The situation sucked, as I was forced to initiate the shutdown several times as I went through the dialogs. With Windows 8 things are even worse. As soon as you initiate the shutdown you are shown a useless screen where you can't do anything except see a list of the applications pending a save showing up as "Not Responding" and your only choices are to forcefully terminate them (without saving) or abort the shutdown. This leaves me manually closing all the open applications which is a very annoying and long process, taking up to 10 minutes. Is there a way to tell the PC to shut down which shuts down all apps without pending saves but lets me have a chance to respond to the save dialogs, shutting off the PC when I am done? 

I've crimped my first RJ45 connector onto a Cat6 network cable and it seems to work fine (yey Internet). Now I wonder, how to test the cable thoroughly, i.e., how to test whether it is able to reach its Gigabit maximum? I do not have one of those fancy cable testers which are horribly expensive. Is it enough to copy some file from one computer to another and check the data transfer speed? Are there any command line utilities (Windows 10) to test network loss on high-speed transfer? 

In Notepad++, in contrast to most other editors, I cannot use SHIFT+ENTER in the find dialog to search in the different direction (prominently used, to go back to the previous find position). Is there a different shortcut? Any option I can set to enable this behavior? 

I've got a brand new DS216j NAS. It is a budget NAS, I know, still, I was hoping to get more than 3MB/s upload rate. I can't find out what is the limiting factor, but somehow all my uploads are limited to around 3MB/s. Any ideas on what could be the reason? Network is fast enough, I can copy at a much higher rate between two computers on my LAN. What's also weird: if I simultaneously upload to the NAS via FTP, web (File Manager) and Windows Explorer I have around 3MB/s at EACH. Is there some kind of weird connection limit in place? I have checked, and my user (not being the default admin), has not set any limits/quotas. Any other ideas what could be wrong? 

I think the reason was nicely explained in one of the comments of the blog post linked by Roald's answer: 

You probably inadvertently pressed ctrl shift '. This is a windows shortcut that affects some applications (examples include: mIRC, gtalk, wordpad, etc) and causes the behavior you are describing. Pressing the shortcut again or restarting the computer will disable it (and hence Dmnisih's answer is incorrect). 

You can achieve very high download speeds much much faster by increasing at the cost of higher bandwidth overhead. From personal experience I can say that changing that setting greatly improved download speeds, especially in the first few seconds/minutes after adding the torrent. It can be found in Preferences => Advanced. I have it set to 2000. This is most helpful in torrents that have a very large amount of seeds (more than 100) and the vast majority of them are not uploading or uploading at very low speed (your typical public bittorrent tracker). It is useless for torrents that have something like 30 seeds (but in that case it doesn't increase the bandwidth overhead either). 

which resolves the dependencies automatically. Personally I used Macports to install python2.7 with matplotlib and it seems to works fine on 10.7. Fink is in the process of upgrading their internals to work with the new 10.7 build system. 

I'm making time lapse movies spanning several weeks and want to get rid of the pictures taken during the night (i.e. between 22:45 and 5:00 in this case), how can I do this easily? I've found the following partial solutions: 

To my knowledge only workarounds exist, such as giving the password away via SSID or other means, or having an empty password. That way the communication can still be secure (depending on the configuration). 

I'm not sure why this helps, so perhaps somebody can add some background as to why this helps. Hopefully this helps someone else.
