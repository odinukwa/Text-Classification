Are you using DHCP in this environment? If so, I believe you can specify one or more WINS servers as part of the DHCP lease. This is the option in ISC DHCP. This would configure them to use a wins server you specify without having to go touch each machine. 

I think you need to set up a display manager such as GDM. When Xvnc is starting up, it tries to communicate with a running display manager via XDMCP. That's what the option is in your xinetd file. I've set up GDM on Hardy before, and it worked pretty well. Give this a try: Install GDM if it's not already installed. Edit /etc/gdm/gdm-cdd.conf: 

There is a standardized interface. RFC 2136 describes it. The program that comes with BIND implements it. As far as I know most DNS servers support it. You'll have to shop around carefully though unless you're running your own DNS servers, as a lot of providers don't enable it. $URL$ $URL$ 

I like the other answers, but you could also try loop mounting all the RHEL iso's (on one of the servers you already have configured), and then serving them up with http - I believe RHEL lets you choose http server. This worked for me - and I could just let it go for hours and not worry about a thing. 

I personally try to avoid mixing a compiled program with the rpm ones- as they require changing where each program looks for components of the other (and env Variable setting). You may find it easier to compile php than try to use the rpm version - which you are most likely going to have to munge with for hours until php plays nice with the source-built apache you have. I think you may actually find it easier to build php than try to mess with the paths in the pre-compiled version - but I have always done the rpm builds of both apache and php (which works fine). Again my rule is don't mix local build versions and centos rpms - that is bound to cause you headaches. 

I thought there wasn't a way to do this, but turns out there might be. The CustomLog directive can look for the existence of an environment variable to decide to log the request or not. Combine that with mod_rewrite to set that environment variable, and I think you have what you're looking for. 

I can't say much about the performance difference between BDB and FSFS, but I can definitely say that FSFS is far more stable. I'd suggest using it over BDB simply to preserve your sanity. When we had a largish repos running on BDB, we had to run recovery on it at least once a week, often several times. It was irritating. Now that we use FSFS, it's been rock solid. 

If you really want your site on both domain names without any redirection, you can use a RewriteCond to pull out just the domain name, and it will be available to the RewriteRule as %1. 

do you only have one ftp server on your system? I had similar problems, and then low and behold I looked deeper into the issue and there were two ftp servers installed that were conflicting. I uninstalled one and the problem was fixed. If you did the 'yum install vsftpd' you shouldn't have to mess with pam files (Somethings usually wrong when you start messing with PAM). If that's not that run chkconfig --list | grep ftp and see what comes up ( see if vsftpd shows up there - if not something may be wrong with the install). And my final suggestion would be to run a yum update. 

I'm using tomcat's jscv to start the server ** as a service ** as the user tomcat (using jscv -user tomcat "lots of other parameters"). My server runs fine, however my question is: 

Guy - There are two kinds of power management, one is c states (i.e. c1enhance for intel - something similar for amd), and the other is p states (cool 'n quiet for amd). Is this 'CPU power management' listed under advanced software features in your conifiguration -or are you seeing this somewhere else? If CPU power management is disabled that might mean you already have cool 'n quiet disabled in your bios. Power.CpuPolicy should be set to static if you want cpuz to read the clock frequency. However - dynamic 'dynamically' scales frequency up and down. It may make sense cpuz reads only 528Mhz - your server will run at the lowest frequency necessary to accomplish the current task. See Faq 1 at CPUZ . Maybe try running a load on your server and then see if the frequency scales up. If it is not scaling you will need to do 2 things to (possibly) fix them: 

That's it. It clearly won't tell you how a file was changed, but at least you'll know that it did change in some way. 

Create the directory /etc/default/grub.d if it doesn't exist already. Create a file /etc/default/grub.d/myextraoption.cfg adding to the variable you want (Append to it only, with an extra space. You want to be careful to not clobber or mangle any existing data there.): 

First thing that comes to mind is that mod_rewrite isn't on. Just loading the module isn't enough. Somewhere in your config you also need to enable it. $URL$ 

will show you the target of a link. Is that what you need? Another option is . Oops, sorry, didn't read everything there. How about . The tells ls to dereference the link, so you'll see the target there instead of the link. 

Most of the time, e2fsck will not run unless it thinks it should. You can force it in a situation like this. Try adding the flag, like . 

So basically this is what I have learned from this experience: Don't use the packaged version of gjc and then install other java on top of that (even when using alternatives!). I guess this could be the 'best practice' rule: 

If you're talking about ESXi 4.x I don't know any ways to make a virtual machine not using the GUI. I know you can copy and move existing machines - or even deploy new ones from your 'gold' copy of your favorite OS. If you're talking about using the VMware player, again just use the GUI - it was made for a reason and it seems to do its job well. When you say "separate server using the vmplayer app" it sounds like you probably just want to install ESXi and run that... Please explain what you are trying to accomplish better. 

The MegaRAID MSM is MegaRAID_Storage_Manager-13.01.04-00.noarch And MegaCli is MegaCli-8.02.16-1.i386 All of these packages are installed through the LSI provided packages. Any dependencies have been installed through yum, so they should be up to date. I find it hard to believe that there are no temperature changes (not even \pm 1 degree) at all throughout a day (as the temperature of the environment is not nearly constant). Everything else works properly so I find this odd. I should note that gives the same temperatures as - so where ever these utilities are obtaining their data from is consistent. If anyone has seen this or solved this issue I would appreciate some insight as to why these values don't seem to update. 

Try putting quotes around in your command lines. I suspect that has spaces and those might confuse it by looking like several separate arguments. 

What kind of video interface do you have in your system? Some on-board video chips use the system memory for their own uses, making it unavailable to the OS. It's most likely configurable in your bios. 

That will ensure it starts on system boot and all that goodness. With that in place, just don't touch the one in the sharing panel. 

Do you have this job in a user's crontab (Can you see it with ?) or is it in the system crontab ()? The system crontab (On linux at least, don't know about other systems) requires an additional user argument that the user crontabs do not. In a user specific crontab, it should look like: 

Make sure to remove the packaged erlang first. Grab erlang here: $URL$ I used R13B02-1, but whatever the latest is should work. Configure with . I compiled it without any of that and Couch died immediately on startup. I think the threads is the important one for Couch, but all those seemed like good ideas. 

Do the same for C1Enhanced in the bios if the above doesn't work. If you do this you will be running hotter / more power (if you server is constantly idle). These settings don't really matter if your server CPU is utilized fully (near 75%+ constant CPU load- i.e. you can't save any power if you're always running close to 100%!). Finally - CPUZ is not a great choice for determining processor specs in a vm. You should use some benchmarking software (SPEC) to get an accurate understanding of what your processor is doing! I have windows machines under ESXi that read all kinds of weird ( some read 50% max cpu utilization when it is 100%- some get confused if you add/remove processors/ switch to a computer with higher/lower base clock speeds), so I wouldn't rely on any software based CPU gauges. You really need to run a benchmark to give you an understanding of whats actually going on, as there is too much between you and the CPU when virtualizing! 

Have you upgraded the Mac OS since installing XCode? System updates, major ones anyway like 10.5 to 10.6, may remove those programs from /usr/bin. Download the latest Xcode and reinstall. It should put them back. 

As Dennis pointed out above, it's gzip. Part of the gzip header is a mod time for whatever is compressed in the file. If you need gzip, you can compress the tarfile as an extra step outside of tar rather than using tar's internal gzip. The gzip command has a flag to suppress the saving of that modification time. 

Screen recognizes a few extra control sequences that the terminal inside a window can send to affect Screen. Of particular interest to you will probably be the \ek and \e\ sequences. Anything in between those two will be used by Screen as the window title. You can then put the window title in your caption line. $URL$ Give this a try: 

Using sge with resource complex called 'gpu.q' that allows resource management of gpu devices (these are all nvidia devices). However on the systems there are multiple gpu devices (in exclusive mode) and if two jobs are allocated on the same node there is no way for the user to opaquely create a context on the correct gpu. Has anyone run into this problem ? I was thinking of somehow managing specific gpu resources and mapping the host and device id's. Something like 

I have an ASUS PIKE 2208 ( this is LSI SAS2208 ROC ) configured and working with four physical drives. Additionally I have installed the LSI SNMP agent. The agent provides all the data defined by the LSI-MegaRAID-SAS-MIB. However, I've noticed that after LSI MegaRAID SNMP agent is started the values (on Objects such as LSI-MegaRAID-SAS-MIB::temperatureROC.0) do not change over long or short periods of time. Put simply, values seem to remain the same once the snmp agent has started. However simply restarting the snmp agent seems to (sometimes) update the values. Interestingly, if a consistency check or patrol read are performed, values from the SNMP agent seem to update (the drive temperature fluctuates both up and down - not just up as one may expect from increased disk activity). I'm running Centos 6.5 with the following versions of the LSI MegaRAID software: Agent:LSI MegaRAID SNMP Agent Ver 3.18.0.2 (Oct 30th, 2012) firmwareVersion = 23.16.0-0021:3.270.95-2635:Jul 12 2013:14:20:36 driverVersion = megaraid_sas:06.505.02.00 

I just did this install myself recently. The Erlang included in Hardy is too old. Simple as that. You need to build Erlang as well as CouchDB. 

This is not at all clear in the documentation. What I believe is happening here is that causes the session to read only the rows or bytes or whatever that existed when the table was locked, regardless of what size the table actually is when it gets to it. Rows can continue to be inserted into the table, but only at the end, past the locked portion of the table. 

Short answer: Use the flag on your RewriteRule. First, a little Apache backstory. When Apache receives a request, it goes though a process of mapping that request to the local storage. After that, Apache actually has two pieces of data on what you requested. The request url, and the file path. So a request for is translated into and that path is stored separately. mod_rewrite lets you tweak this behavior to route urls where you want. Now, the two RewriteRules you have there are implicitly doing different things.
