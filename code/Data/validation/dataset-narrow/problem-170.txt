Is there a way to "TagAll" VLANs on a HP Switch Port as it would be in a Cisco environment (by default on a cisco trunk port all VLANs are allowed, or one can explicilty define "allowed vlans tagall -> which then again is default config and won't show up in the running conf) So far on HP Switches I am only aware of the ability to "vlan x tagged port y". Everytime I created a new vlan on the HP switch I would have to add it tagged to the port if. Any one know of any options? thanks 

Connection refused means the switch us alive (pingable). So it could be an acl, or the vty lines being disabled. It's possible someone logged in, changed the config and got thrown out. If you are lucky the running config hasn't been saved, so you could reboot (usually a "reboot in X" is a good idea when messing with authentication) and hope it comes up with a saved config that still allows access. Or simply as Ron Maupin said, get console access. If it's in a remote location I would try get someone to restart it. Do you save your logs somewhere? Perhaps that will give a hint as to who did what. Also another thought, yoy said you use TACACS, is the TACACS server reachable from the location of the switch? Check routing and acls towards the TACACS servsr. In general it's good practice to configure a local fallback method, so that when tacacs is not reachable you can use a local user. 

MooseBalm, can you confirm, you are blocking RAs and the problem has been solved? It would be even better if you could kill them closer to the source, on the AP, or disable it on the clients completely. 

Does anyone know if it is possible to remotely change the mgmt IP, vlan and default gw of a HP Switch without loosing connectivity when ssh to said IP? 

some routing protocols can be in the same L2 domain and support the likes of apple talk or other non IP L3/4 protocols. These would need to be in the same L2 domain but not be in the same IP subnet, since IP is not required. In such a case it may be practical to use VLANS without considering IP/Subnetting of any kind. 

The medium for wireless communication is air/space which is limited. There is only so much of it. The more clients connecting the more medium is used less medium there is for others. The signal strength would not really be compromised. The signal strength depends on the room parameters (humidity, type of walls, other radio frequencies in operation). There is a limited amout of clients that can connect. The limit is generally bound to the specs of the access point, but in essence would be limited to the amount of available bandwidth/space in the air within that given frequency. So I think to answer your question, the more users connecting to an access point the less performance in general you can expect, this resulting because of shared bandwidth/medium (space). Signal strength is more of a constant, how far that signal gets or how many clients your access point can serve is based on other factors. 

RSTP needs backwards compatibility with STP switches. Thus Discarding state merges Disabled, Blocking, Listening into one. Ideally if running a complete RSTP topology then discarding becomes practically unneeded due to the explanation below. In STP BPDU will only be sent from root bridge > down, therefore non-root bridges would only forward on BPDUs that are received from the root-bridge via their root port. Therefore topology change will mean a longer convergence time as the TCN has to be propagated to the root bridge first then from the root bridge out to all remaining bridges in the switching domain. For STP Hello(2 secs), max age timer (10 x hello time, by default 20s), then 15s each for Listening and Learning. If no timers are touched for STP and you haven't enabled any add-on features like backbonefast or uplinkfast then you can be looking at ~50s for convergence time. In RSTP all switches can send BPDUs every hello time period not just the root bridge, the BPDUs carry up to date information. This enables faster convergence as the switch that determines the failure can advise the rest of the switching domain(bridge) of the TCN(Topology Change Notification) immediately. As the failure detection time becomes 3 x hello timer. Therefore if the hello timers are left at the default of 2 secs, detection of a failure can happen within ~6 secs. RSTP also has two additional port states: Alternate port : Technically in discarding state but is allocated as a alternate best path to the root-bridge. If the current root port fails the alternate port will take over. Backup port : This port is allocated as a redundant designated port. If there is already a designated port forwarding for that segment then this port will remain backup until it is needed. Technically this port is in discard state until needed. One more point RSTP marks edge ports as ports connected to end devices (No BPDUs expected on this port). This enables STP 'portfast' features to ensure the host port comes up as quickly as possible to avoid dropping DHCP packets etc. These are the main differences - Hope this helps. 

The antenna still needs to be connected to something that will function as the bridge in Building B. This will allow a bridge connection between A and B allowing clients to talk between the buildings. As the clients will need to associate with something locally as well as they won't just bounce off the passive antenna. I'd put an AP in Building B that can bridge to an AP in Building A to provide a wireless uplink (bridge connection), ideally in the 5GHz spectrum. This connection can be omnidirectional depending on distance between buildings, if it is a fair distance away (>150m then I'd probably start looking at directional antenna instead). Then have that AP also function as a local AP in the 2.4GHz spectrum for building B clients to associate with for connectivity. Omindirectional 7dBi should be plenty... but again there is no mention of area/distance/size so it is hard to provide a recommendation without these measurement factors. 

Solution: This is what i did on radius, map ASA attributes with ldap group. and its working now. /etc/raddb/users 

Update: Someone suggested run BGP on Internet connectivity but use OSPF for internal routing between Router <---> L3 switch as per above diagram if i plan to configure OSPF between Router and L3 switch then what network i will advertise on OSPF command? Example: ISP provided 10.1.1.0/24 subnet to us how do i configure BGP and OSPF for internal network? Any suggestion? 

EDIT I am pinging my peer public address and packet loss there so its not Internet issue. I am clearly seeing my tunnel getting drop and after 2 packet drop its back itself, Is there anyway i can find reason for dropping tunnel or logs? We have many tunnel to remote site and they all working fine except this one. I am continuing ping to remote LAN IP and intermediately seeing packet drop and same time i notice tunnel down, and after few packet missing in ping it back itself. If you notice my output, i am notice this 

We have with and it seems strange on our SNMP monitoring its showing Max CPU utilization 70% and avg 35% but when i check on command line numbers are totally different, what is the best command to check CPU utilization on Cisco which give correct info. We are pumping 4Gbps on this router and running BGP with bunch of ACL and netflow. I want to see who is eating most CPU (i believe it must be ACL but just want to see how much?) 

We have VPN tunnel with our customer and they sent their side VPN config and i am trying to put that config in my Cisco ASA 5585 (9.x) version and it has missing command Customer config (remote) 

We have ASR1006 Router and we are running ACL on it to allow specific port to specific server. Question is there any ACL performance impact on individual IP vs full subnet. like following example. we have 202.100.100.0/24 subnet now i want to use first 200 IPs for web server port 80 remaining 55 (whatever) mail service port 25. Now how do i tell ACL to isolate them or subnet them? Other option i have i create individual ACL for each IP like following but question is does it impact on router performance? 

We have 4x1G on trunk and for troubleshooting i want to monitor one of its physical port. Can i monitor using port and configure its physical port for source SPAN? 

RSTP - configure both links the same. Ensure that RSTP is enabled on both sides of the link via 'set protocols rstp interface xe-blah' or just ensure 'set protocol rstp interface all' is configured. RTG - Must explicitly disable RSTP. RTG and RSTP are mutually exclusive. Once RSTP is disabled configure both links the same but also provide the RTG group configuration under ethernet-switching options - ($URL$ Link aggregation - Create aggregated ethernet interface, the trunk configuration goes under the aggregated ethernet interface while the physical members will just be configured to be members of the AgEth bundle. Example: 

Really plain and simple: A routed protocol is one which is designed to be routed via a given routing protocol. Example 1: IP = routed protocol EIGRP = routing protocol EIGRP enables the routing of IP. Therefore it is a routing protocol which routes IP. Example 2: CLNS\CLNP = routed protocol IS-IS = routing protocol IS-IS enables the routing of IP and CLNS\CLNP. Therefore it is a routing protocol which routes IP and CLNS\CLNP. 

It is best practice not to be logging in as root however unless special circumstances requires it... even then you would log in as a normal user and 'su root' to gain elevated privileges. What I would do is setup a user profile under 'set system login': 

Keep in mind that one basic rule for the ASA is that to initiate traffic from a lower-security interface(Outside) to a higher security interface(Inside) there must be a explicit ACL entry to allow this traffic through. Without seeing your ASA configuration it is hard to tell what could be causing the problems. 

Ubuntu(Linux) doesn't perform gateway functions aka forward IP packets by default. You must explicitly tell the system to do so >> /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward This guide should help you: $URL$ My hunch is that on your physical topology you already made that change. 

I concur with Daniel. 'How Computer Networks work' is a broad spectrum.... this needs to be focused to what the end outcome is. If you want to have solid Network Engineering knowledge there will be plenty of advice here, however without knowing what your goals are there is little point listing them down here. There are some books I do recommend for general knowledge: 

What you're looking for requires creative use of pipes like you've already suggested. Just a thought - why wouldn't you use a NMS and query the telemetry data to display this for you? 

In above scenario do i need to specify or open RTP port range on ASA or does ASA will use method when VoIP phone initiate connection to SIP server? How does firewall handle UDP port stat? because in TCP we know its stateful but how does firewall understand its UDP traffic initiated from inside to outside to keep that port open bi-directional traffic? If i enable does that automatically open RTP media port after inspection in ? what if i do not enable in that case do i need to open full RTP port range to allow outside to inside traffic? 

we have 10G fiber running since 1 year but today i have migrate that same link to ASR1006 and i am seeing following error, what could be the wrong? 

We have IPsec tunnel which is working but somehow getting drop and reconnect itself and that causing disturbance in application, i am unable to find root cause. I have check and map setting both side also key lifetime too. This is what i am seeing when i continue run following command. 

Everything working good but when i remove cable to test Redundancy i am seeing error in failover state command 

Look like arp related issue showing every ~85 second my arp table getting flushed so something is not OK here... what is triggering arp-flood? Lets investigate in STP because because that could be the problem of arp, Hmm based on following output something changed at 

We have above scenario where currently we have only single link with but soon we are planning to have second link on same BGP router but ISP side it will comes from . I heard its recommended to configure BGP with loopback source but i don't know how does that fit in DUAL router scenario. This is what we have currently configured in my router. 

I have verified and other side of switch has same configuration. i have matched them word to word. Here is the etherchannel summary 

We had DDoS couple days ago and following is netflow data but i am confused with numbers which i am seeing here. If you look at first column so it's in GB what does this means? I have checked network interface graph and i am seeing only spike in link. 

I have setup ASA5506 for cisco anyconnect VPN and i am able to connect VPN but not able to ping or ssh or anything to any device on remote lan (inside) network 10.0.10.x/24 Here is the network diagram: 

You're likely emulating using the wrong NICs. If the correct NICs are used the ge interfaces should appear in 'show interfaces terse'. Configuring them is one thing... but having them actually present within the virtualized device is entirely different. If you're using virtualbox to run the vSRX image then try - paravirtualized network (virtio-net) NIC. I believe that should help. 

1) Yes the Primary vlan is the entity that homes the shared subnet for community and isolated vlans. Why would each switch have their own Primary vlan address? (Is your switch management vlan the same vlan as the Primary vlan?) Thus I imagine your core switch is performing MLS(Multi-Layer Switching) and homes the Primary Vlan SVI? 2) You don't need to define three different isolated vlans. The purpose of the isolated vlan is to only allow communication between an isolated port and promiscuous port. By definition the isolated host will not be able to communicate with any other type of port other than the promiscuous port. Just trunk one isolated vlan through the pvlan domain and utilize it. Another note is that a Primary Vlan can be associated with at most one isolated vlan and many community vlans. Likewise a Promiscuous port can only served one primary vlan, one isolated vlan and many community vlans. 3) Why do you need to trunk the vlans through to your fortinet firewall? If it isn't absolutely necessary I'd turn this into a routed link between the core switch and the fortinet. If your core switch is L3 capable. 4) Just use a Promiscuous-PVlan trunk for the link to devices that don't support PVLAN or protected ports. This will ensure secondary vlan tagged frames are rewritten with the primary vlan tag when crossing the trunk. Although if you make 3) happen then this may not be necessary anymore AIUI. HTH. Feel free to ask for clarification. 

Beacon frames contain timestamps which the client uses to update its clock. Technically it does know when a beacon arrives due to this. A client is expected to wake up and listen to a minimum of one beacon when the listening time is up. HTH. 

Without a screenshot we can only make an assumption. One thing I will point out is that vlan 1 is the native vlan by default on a trunk port. The native vlan is used to send untagged traffic via a trunk. Perhaps this is what the CLI is displaying.
