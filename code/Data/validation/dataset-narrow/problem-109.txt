In OSPF DBD packets are send as unicast packets even in braodcast network types right ? Question here is, how does the OSPF router know the neighbor's interface address in the LAN ? Only information it has exchanged already is HELLO packets, which has neighbor's Router IDs and the interface address of DR and BDR alone. Also the subnet mask of the LAN. 

AFAIK 802.1Q tag is optional in the FRame header. So it may or not be present in the header right? SO how does the Packet processing ASIC or processor identifies or parses to interpret the frame header as vlan tag present or not present ? 

I think I got confused by the output on lsdb on ABR. It will display LSDB for both areas , but for a moment I forgot that it is ABR and was wondering how summary lsa for network in neighboring area(area 2) was displayed in area 0 router still displaying it as area 2. Later realized that is it ABR and LSDB being displayed in the show output is combined LSDB of both the areas:- Answer: Area ID of type-3 lsa for a network in one area(say area 1) is not retained when generated for another area(say area 0). output:- topology:- 

How is the originating AREA ID of a type-3 summary lsa is fetched? This is the AREA ID displayed as in "show ip ospf lsdb". The AREA-ID field in OSPF header is the area to which the OSPF packet is destined right?, then how is the originating AREA ID information is retained for type-3 LSAs when flood across areas ? 

The definition is correct. On layer 3, IP addresses are used to identify machines throughout different networks. Basically you can think of it like this: 

When a computer asks for a webpage, it wil first select a random unused portnumber from the random range (1024-65535). Let's pick . Then the following sequence will happen: Computer send it's packet with: source IP , source port , destination IP , destination port . The packets arrive at the webserver, it sees it's own IP and port , so it knows this is a request for a webpage. The webserver then sends the webpage back in packets with Source IP , Source port 80, destination IP , destination port . The computer recieves these packets, and knows wich requested webpage it was, because of the portnumber . These port combinations are often written as such: and . Now, the number of computers on the internet far outnumbers the number of IPv4 addresses available. To preserve address space, a set of private address ranges was introduced, that can be freely used for address sharing. These rangese are referred to as RFC1918 and are the following: 

SNMP counters will not be cleared while the device is up. The idea is that the software polling the counters will keep a tally of the current counter and simply looks at the delta since the last poll. See also this Cisco FAQ about SNMP counters, which says: 

R1 knows routes from R2 (Direct) and R5 (Direct) R2 knows routes of R1 (Direct), R3 (Direct), R4 (Reflected by R3) and R5 (Reflected by R1 and R3) R3 knows routes of R2 (Direct) and R4 (Direct) R4 knows routes of R3 (Direct) and R5 (Direct) R5 knows routes of R1 (Direct), R2 (Reflected by R1) and R4 (Direct) 

Can a single NLRI have more than one AS-Segment in an AS-path? Is AS-segment same as a AS-Number in a AS-path ? 

Only master generates next sequence number, so in this case will master keep sending empty DD packets with more bit turned off and just increment the sequence numbers until slave turns off the more-bit ? If the understanding in above point-1 is not correct , will the master not hit exchangeDone before slave ? 

Context :- For network monitoring/packet mirrioring techniques like SPAN and RSPAN. Why is it mandatory to have a dedicated vlan for RSPAN ? why can't we mirror the packets received in a port and send it directly to a specific destination, why to forward it as vlan only ? 

The link-type in router lsa link information would be stub if the interface is passive.(loopbacks are passive by default), which implies that there is no ospf router on that link. If a OSPf link is not passive then OSPF uses link type as transit. Point-to-point and virtual links are explicitly configured and hence the config information can be used to fill in the link-type os router lsa links. Hope this cover all link types. 

From RFC and tutorials in the internet I understand that the MPLS cloud acts as a switch and switches traffic between end points in a VPLS. And that VPLS ID along with RD is used to reach the VPLs site across mpls cloud. But I 'm trying to understand how the destination ip address is mapped. Any reference? Any one has sample vpls packet captures ? In show vpls table cli commands of vendors like cisco and Juniper the VPLS ID is mapped with a destination ip addresses. How is this mapping formed ? 

(For the following I will ignore any DNS lookups or layer two action, since that isn't the relevant part for the NAT story.) Any TCP connection is a tuple of four parts: 

MAC addresses aren't stored in RAM, but in TCAM. You can adjust the Resource Allocation of your TCAM by using a different SDM profile. The default is 6K unicast MAC addresses. The only profile that offers more space for is the VLAN profile, which offers 12K address, but reduces the number of routes you can use to 0. Having 6K MAC addresses is indicative of a different problem though. When you see that many MAC addresses on a switch, you might be looking at Layer 2 segments that are too large. When you have too many hosts in the same Layer two segment, you have a lot of overhead of all those chatty hosts. Also, if anything bad happens on the network, and there is no segmentation, everything will be affected. Also, seeing so many MAC addresses on the 3750X probably means that your network is very oversubscribed, making the 3750X a huge bottleneck. So, the better question to ask yourself first is: Why are there so many unicast MAC addresses on this switch, and how can this be reduced? 

NB: For the reflection to happen, the RR does not have to be able to route to the destined networks. All calculations and validation of what goes into the routing table, will be done at each router individually.
