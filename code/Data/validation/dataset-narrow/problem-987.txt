People need to keep in mind that not all bios firmware are able to deal with a GPT drive. I have a USB Seagate 4 Tb drive that was GPT from the factory and neither of my two computers would boot with the drive plugged into the USB port. The machines will freeze at the F2 Enter Setup F10 Boot menu screen and the only thing that can be done at that point is to turn the power off and turn it back on. Once I converted the drive to MBR which kills about 2 Tb of drive space, both systems will start and boot into the OS as normal with the drive connected. I'm looking for a BIOS patch to rectify this problem. 

What must be considered regarding extensions in any application is that the application must have the functionality programed into it. While Opera Neon may be based on Opera, the current staff at Opera do not, and have not had the same vision of usability that the original developer of Opera who has not been with Opera for a long time, had. The ability to support extensions was intentionally programmed out of Opera as the current developer team is of the opinion that extensions that make web browsers more user friendly and able to serve the user's needs, are unnecessary. Sadly, the mentality of not serving the user's needs is currently spreading across the developer community and is evident in the way Firefox has not only limited it's flagship browser, but introduced bugs as well. Neon is based on the concept that new is always better even if you cannot do with the new, what you are able to do with the old. If you wish to add extensions to your browser, you have no choice but to either stick with the previous version of Opera or, change over to a browser where the developer community retains and supports that vision that a browser should and ought to be flexible enough to support the user's needs. Not hinder their browsing experience. 

I am working on an article with colorful drawings, but because it will be printed on black-and-white printers, I want to make sure it looks good without colors. I have Ubuntu and currently use Evince to view the paper (in Postscript or PDF format). Is there a way to tell Evince to show me the paper as it would look like when printed on a black-and-white printer? Alternatively, is there a different PS/PDF viewer that can do this? 

I would like to install a transparent proxy with content filtering (such as Squid) on my Siemens ADSL SL2-141 router, such that all requests in my home network are automatically routed through the proxy, without having to install the proxy on each computer and each browser. I looked in the API of the router and haven't found any setting that looks like "proxy". Here is the list of commands I see when I telnet into the router: 

But, it seems to have no effect: I can still access this IP address from my browser. What am I doing wrong? EDIT: I changed the settings based on the answers, but it still doesn't work: 

My BenQ screen looks unsharp and grainy. I downloaded a new driver from BenQ site, but I don't know how to install it. Windows Vista's hardware manager shows "Generic PnP monitor". How to install my downloaded driver? 

I just wanted to update this: Google has now added about 30 new themes to their page, under the artist tab. Some are really good, some aren't but at least we have more choices. 

I really hate the Google Chrome Dev warning that opens every time I use Google Chrome on Linux. Is there anyway to disable it. 

So I have a Dell Inspiron 1526 that has a broadcom bcm4312 wireless card. I installed Ubuntu and (big surprise) the wireless card isn't working. No problem for a hot shot like me who has fixed this same problem before on my old laptop. Just install bc43xx-fwcutter and install the firmware, well it didn't work. Needless to say I've been googleing for more than an hour and I'm tuff out of luck. So how can I get this to work? Oh, one minor note: I don't have anyway to connect to the internet on said computer because all I have is wireless that is being pick upped from across the street (no ethernet), but I do have another computer that can connect. 

I want to have both of my scrollbar buttons at the bottom like the way it is on a mac. How can I do this in Ubuntu? I know some themes support it but I was wondering if there was a way to make this permanent for all themes. 

In my work computer, I like to stay logged into my email accounts, Facebook etc. However, I am concerned that someone might get into my computer when I am away (e.g. an administrator can log into my computer even if I lock or logout), open a web browser, and thus access to my email and Facebook without even having to know my passwords. Is there a way to add a startup password to browsers (particularly Firefox and Chromium), such that this simple hack will not be possible? In Firefox there is "Master Password", but it seems to protect only the passwords saved within Firefox, e.g., if a hacker tries to login from Firefox to my email account, he will not have Firefox automatically fill the password. But, if I am already logged in to my email account in Firefox, it doesn't even ask for my password so this doesn't help. 

I just bought an ASUS laptop with Windows 8 installed. How can I access the BIOS? I tried to click any of the usual keys during power-up: ESC, DEL, F10, F8, F2... non of them work - I just get to Windows. How can I determine the correct key? Do I have to just restart my laptop over and over again, trying each of the keys on my keyboard, until the BIOS shows up? 

Such a tool does exist, it's called Timeshift. The linked article is about Ubuntu but it works for multiple distros. 

My Compaq Presario laptop hard drive has failed (luckily I was prepared). Now I want to refurbish this machine for another use. I'm going to need a new hard drive and was wondering where I could get the cheapest model. I don't need a big hard drive (just big enough to run Ubuntu). That means anything bigger than 15 GB's will do just fine. I need an IDE (PATA) hard drive. Where can I get the cheapest one that is bigger than 15 GBs? 

This has been a feature request in Ubuntu for a while now. As of yet their is no official support, but there is a work around: a) Export to PDF in OpenOffice. b) Use pdfnup to print multiple pages per sheet. 

I have the airline plugin installed for vim and no matter which theme I pick there is always an orange arrow in the bottom right corner of the screen. How can I fix this? 

I've had this problem on my laptop for sometime now. Anytime I try to use my touchpad it works correctly about 60% of the time in Windows, the other 40% of the time, it will jump to a random spot on the screen. It has had this problem in Windows XP, Vista, and 7! I did clean installs of each OS. Now heres where it gets weird, when I switch to Ubuntu 9.04, my touchpad works fine 100% of the time. Is there some way I can fix this? 

My connection to gmail is very slow and I am trying to understand why. Running traceroute gives the following output: 

I have the exact same settings for the "inbound" direction. Even when I access the IP adddress directly as http : // 65.55.206.228, it is still not blocked. EDIT: Here is the traceroute: 

EDIT: I now noticed that the link http : // 65.55.206.228 hangs in Chrome and Lynx (as expected), but it does open on Firefox. 

My Windows 7 computer was very slow, so I decided to shut down most of the startup services (using msservice). After rebooting, I found out that I don't have audio. At the taskbar, there is a small audio icon with a red "X". Hovering over the icon shows that "The Audio Service is not running". I went to Control Panel->Services and tried to start the "Windows Audio" service, but got an error: "Error 1068: The dependency service or group failed to start". I tried to start the "Windows Audio Endpoint Builder" and got: "Error 1722: The RPC server is unavailable". The services called "Remote Procedure Call (RPC)", "Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Locator" and "RPC Endpoint Mapper" are all started. What more services do I need running in order to start the Windows Audio service? 

Is there anyway I can change a shortcut key that an application has under one of it's menus in Ubuntu. For example I'm running and want it to clear the window when I press CtrlL. 

Everytime I start Ubuntu I get a warning message that says my hard disk is failing. Big deal, it's just a warning, I'm a programmer, I ignore warnings (kidding). On a more serious note: I've already backed up all my data that I need, but I gonna continue to use this computer until it explodes dag napbit! So how do I tell Ubuntu that I don't care and make it stop showing me the warning? 

I have a laptop (Compaq Presario V5000). It's about 4 years old now. My dad bought it at Walmart on Black Friday for $389 (it only had 384MB of memory (now it has 2GB)). It has seen 3 Windows OS's and 4 Ubuntu's (I dual boot). The hard disk has begun to fail. I already have all the data backed up. I wouldn't say my computer is slow, but I wouldn't say its fast either. The processor is a Mobile AMD Sempron 3300+ which runs at about 2.0 GHz. The current tempature after being on for about 6 hours is 43 C (or 104 F). So I'm just wondering:
