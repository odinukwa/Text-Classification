It will depend on your computer, BUS type, and possibly the type of fan it has (some 2-wire fans, common in laptops, do not show up). I would definitely download Speedfan here: $URL$ Then go to Readings tab>Configure>Fans tab. If your fan shows up, you can configure it, if not, I doubt there will be a way to configure it. As you can see in the screenshot, I cannot configure my laptop's fans, so this is not uncommon. This is probably because I have an unsupported BUS, as can be seen on this page: $URL$ I looked for both of your BUS'es, but could not find details on them. You can find this using Software Information for Windows, run it, and look in the motherboard section, or you can simply install Speedfan, and see if the fans show up. 

Not just no, but hell no. It is slower, more expensive, and the weather will definitely interfere with your signal at times. I have Satellite T.V. and want off of it. Only get it is you cannot get Cable or DSL, but would otherwise have to settle for dial-up. 

In Windows, I use "Software Information for Windows", and I have found that occasionally, it can be wrong. My current laptop is specified as having a maximum memory capacity of 2048MB, and a maximum module size of 2048MB for each of two slots. The reality is that the max per slot is correct, and I am safely running 4GB. This information is probably being gathered from the same place regardless of OS (in other words, that I use Windows and you don't is only relevant to how we access this info from the Motherboard), and it clearly can be wrong. Consult the manual and specs for your board or computer model. 

I am editing a document I created and published to the web for another difficult problem, and adapting it to your question. I cannot be 100% sure that the Resource Kit tools will work with XP, but I believe they probably will. 1) Create a batch file to run your script and start your Ruby server. To be frank, I don't have enough info to tell you how to do that. Copy the batch file to a safe place like c:\windows\system32 2) Download the Windows 2003 Resource kit and install it to a directory with NO spaces, not the default in “C:\Program Files”. Use C:\RESOURCEKIT, as I will use it for the rest of the document. This is very important for some programs, which don't understand the space in “C:\Program Files”, but not for others...to be safe, put it here. 3) Open a command prompt, and change to the directory where you installed the Windows 2003 resource kit, in this case, C:\RESOURCEKIT. 4) From that directory, install the script as a service with the following command “instsrv YourServiceName C:\RESOURCEKIT\srvany.exe.” without the quotes around it. You can name the service any reasonably not-too-long name you like, and this will appear in the Services.msc. This should return “The service was successfully added!” Next we have to configure the new YourServiceName service. 5) Open the Registry editor to the [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\YourServiceName] key. 6) Right-click on the YourServiceName key and do “New>Key” and name it Parameters (case sensitive). 7) Expand the new Parameters key and in the right pane right-click and do “New>String Value” and name it Application (case sensitive). 8) Double-click your new “Application” key and enter c:\windows\system32\YourBatchFileName.bat and save it. The service is now ready to run. 9) Test run it from within the Control Panel>Administrator Tools>Services MMC. You will see the service YourServiceName now listed and you can start it. Here is a copy of my original article: $URL$ 

To the best of my knowledge, there is no setting in Outlook to do that. You could download it all, then set your archive setting to remove everything after a certain date to the archive.pst file. 

KVM is designed exactly for that, and there are newer ones that will let you use dual monitors. What I am not sure they will let you do, and I have my doubts about, is have one screen of each computer. 

I do not know if you can fix the disk, but depending on how valuable the data is, File Scavenger would recover it, but the version you would need is $49. $URL$ 

This sounds like it could be any number of things. I am not sure it is Flash player because IE uses an Active X version of it, and the others use the Plug-in version of it, but it is still very easy to uninstall both and then re-install them, so worth trying. I would also use the Flash uninstaller and follow the directions in the link. Another thing in common could be file system corruption, so try running a few times at an elevated command prompt. One last thing that could be in common is Windows file corruption, so run at an elevated command prompt. This will check to make sure that critical Windows files are intact, and not corrupt. 

As noted by soandos, the most restrictive permissions will apply, so if you only have read on the share permissions, it will not matter if you have full control on the security permissions. 

You can follow Wil's answer and fix it, but since you know you are connecting to a computer you KNOW is safe, you can check the box to ignore the certificate. The certificate is just designed to make sure you can trust the host you are connecting to (whether with Remote Desktop, as in this case, or a web site using HTTPS), and you know you can trust it in this case since it is your computer. You can import the certificate, but why bother "fixing" this when you can just check the box, and move on? 

Unfortunately, you most likely cannot do anything about this. The good news is that you have not been hacked. Despite my job as a professional IT guy, I knew a man, 25 years my junior, through chess tournaments, who was one of the world's most prolific spammers (before the CAN SPAM law) until AOL sued him out of business. I got the rare opportunity to see how a major spamming operation works, and frankly it was quite amazing. It also gave me great insight into how they operate, although I am sure it has evolved a lot since, although not for him. He had a T-3 and 40 more 1Mb DSL lines all pumping out millions of SPAM messages daily (250,000/hr 24/7). One of the things spammers do is spoof headers, meaning they say that it is coming from anyone they like. I do a lot of e-mail server work, and part of what I often have to do is test e-mail using Telnet. I put in the e-mail commands line-by-line, and as part of that, I could send an e-mail as anyone in the world, even the President of the United States. There is no verification check. We can tell that a header is spoofed by looking closely at the header information when the e-mail comes in, and what really counts is the underlying IP address it originated from. Of course, if you had their IP address, you could track them down in no time, so they also spoof that in a way: They relay mail through computers that are infected with viruses designed just to allow this relaying. These spammers find underground programs to scan for these open relays, or often they just pay the owner of a botnet. So back to how and why you get the bounce messages: I know my acquaintance would just randomly pick roughly 40-50 unlucky e-mail addresses per spamming computer out of his list of millions, and put them in the "From" box of his spamming programs. So any time one of those e-mails gets sent to an undeliverable e-mail address, the bounce message goes right back to the unlucky e-mail address that was used in the forged header. The only thing you could do is turn off or block all bounce messages, but this is something that is really done at the server level, a level most people do not have access to. The good news is that they will probably randomly pick different e-mail addresses next time, so the problem will hopefully go away...for you. For anyone trying to fight spammers, I do not think you can really fight them by trying to track them down using IP addresses, but one thing that struck me watching the operation I mentioned: Follow the money. That is how to really track someone. 

That router was discontinued back in 2008, and developed long before that, when some ISP's still had these relay servers. I think that most home user will now find this type of feature much more difficult to use now, especially if they do not have the option to enter credentials. My suggestion is to try getting it to work on port 25 first, so you can get the server relay issue addressed first, which is probably an even bigger issue, and then see if you can change the port. 

I actually do exactly that on my Exchange Server: I create different e-mail addresses for every business I do business with, and associate them all with my account. I have Dell@, Symantec@, etc. If one starts getting SPAM, I can delete it, but I also know who is not careful with my e-mail address. You will potentially run into problems, but not because of the domain name. How do you plan on sending the mail? The main issue that I can see facing you is the PTR record: Many domains, and most of the large ones, will drop your mail as SPAM if you do not have a PTR DNS record. If you do not have a business class Internet connection with a static IP, you will not be able to get this (you have to ask your ISP to do it too), but all is not lost. You can pay for a relay service (smarthost), and relay all your mail through them, and they certainly have the requisite PTR record. 

The DVD can be used on other computers, even from different manufactures, but you need to have a valid key for that second computer. 

This is confusing: "the limitation appears to be additive - there is no way (that I know of) to define an exception for a specific user." I am not sure what you mean because you should be able to define exceptions. Log in as the user, and set his specific HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry entry to allow him to access USB devices by turning off the entry. If he is not an admin, this registry entry will not save, so you will have to either give him admin rights, even if only while you make the change (log out and log back in if you do make him an admin), or log in as an administrator, and find his hive under HKEY_USERS and change it there as an admin. You will need to set all the others, who currently have profiles not to allow it. Now, to set it for all future users, navigate to 

I do not know much about that font, but read these two links to see if you can make them work. $URL$ $URL$ 

I did not have a clear view of what was going on at first. I believe that what is happening is that you are downloading, and since you are using a download manager, it is buffering the data, and keeping a constant amount when you are connected, since your Internet connection is relatively constant. The data being written here is Internet to disk (buffer). Once you close your Internet connection, the data and buffering stops, and it writes all the data that is left back to disk at a much higher rate since it is then disk (buffer) to disk (to file). You can see a similar phenomenon if you watch your DVD software (if it has a visual buffering indicator) write a disk, and right at the end, as there is nothing left to buffer, is clears out very quickly. 

Go into Computer Management (right click My Computer>Manage) and navigate to . Right click your share (it will be different from my screenshot), and click "Stop Sharing". 

Personally, I would prefer XCOPY here since it has more options that may be useful, especially if you change the batch file, and then remove the old directory and files using a switch. I would also dump the quotes unless there is an actual space in the file location or name. In your last move, you actually dropped a quote, and that would probably produce an error. Your last statement is also incorrect: You only put the quotes around the WHOLE command before switches, not portions of it. I added the switches I consider potentially useful: You can see what each does by doing an xcopy /? at a command prompt. I would also question whether your, in your last copy, if abc.htm is really in the root directory...check that, and edit accordingly, if necessary. Lastly, make sure you edit the user portion to reflect your username. I don't know anything more about your last line since that is application-specific. 

As noted, the problems can be numerous, but what I would try is first hitting F8 on boot (hit it a few times early so you don't miss it), and trying "Last Known Good". If that does not work, try system restore from "Safe Mode Command Prompt Only" (again F8 on boot). $URL$ 

Between the directory it is in, and the page, you should be able to tell if it is legitimate. If it has nothing listed in the details page as to who made it, and it is located on one of your temp directories, or Internet temp directories, you probably have a virus. If it is in \Program Files, and you can Google the maker of the file, and see they are legit, you are probably OK. 

Actually in radio theory, range decreases the higher you go in the spectrum, but you gain clarity. That is why submarines use very low frequency (VLF) to transmit long distances. $URL$ Despite that, I still like the upper ranges since they seem to be less susceptible to interference, like from most cordless phones in the 2.4 GHz range. This link deals with phones, but the radio theory is the same. $URL$ (go down to the section "What's with the new 5.8GHz?") 

Many home routers are not that granular to allow blocking of download ports, and I checked your manual, but I was surprised to find yours could. You have a number of options on pages 39-42 below, but the one I would go for is: 

Since you say that it is never connected to the Internet, we can all but rule out viruses, so you almost certainly have almost certainly corrupted some important program file along the way. 

The abilities of any Anti-virus can be debated since none of them are perfect. In this case, if you look at all the links at the very bottom, the site is clearly skewed against Windows Security Essentials, so I would hardly trust it. They clearly have an ax to grind, at least, and they may be up to real no good. As far as your second point, I agree, I would not normally run two anti-virus programs simultaneously as it would indeed slow performance. 

Go to Control Panel>Mail>Show Profiles and check "Always use this profile" and pick one. Your GMail is trying to open Outlook for you. 

Go into Start>All Programs>Accessories>System Tools>Scheduled Tasks. Use the "Add a Scheduled Task" wizard, and browse to your program if it is not listed. Choose "one time only" when prompted for how often you want to to do it (you will change this in a moment). At the end of the wizard, click "Open advanced properties for this task when I click Finish". Once you complete this, you will be able to go to the Schedule tab>Advanced and set the job to go off every 5 minutes. 

If you type do and it opens in a regular box, the answer is almost certainly not. The program is calling the command box on its own, and in full-screen mode. You are not going to be able to change the program's code. I also know of no way to inhibit the cmd from running in full screen. If do Start>Run>cmd and it opens in full screen, then it is something in your registry and we can attack that if you post back. 

Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 use the same kernel. It is probably just common code that was borrowed, and used for both OS'es, and by accident they left that directory there on Server 2008 R2. I can confirm that both directories exist exactly as you decribe on other clean systems.
