I generally prefer to solve problems without macros, however I couldn't find an easy solution without them now. Below macro inverts selected matrix and writes it back to the original location or to a new worksheet. To run the macro: 

Type in a cell and select it (CTRL+C) Select the range you want to modify Go to - home - paste - paste special, in the pop-up window mark "Multiply" then press Ok. 

it's actually 6 cells, it seems to be one as borders are white, but small round / square icon at the end of cells indicates that that's the end of the cell. Also there are some extra space below the texts, it may come from 

You can't do exactly what you're looking for. Closest workaround is to add a new column to your data where you enter different values for rows to include / exclude. Then it's easy to filter on pivot table. 

At first create two columns with all the 100 possibilities for the two digits. Insert your calculation in the third column, e.g. , here you can filter for the desired result, or you can use a pivot take I'd you don't want to have hidden rows. 

You can set the action that happens when you close the lid. Setting it to hibernation will hibernate your pc the same way as if you would do it manually. I don't see any reason why not to do it. Sleep: there is also a setting "hibernate after", it will wake up the pc even from sleep and hibernate it. Again it doesn't depend on whether you sent your pc manually or by closing the lid. Some laptop's has functionality to detect when they're moved and stop HDD (hp calls it "driver guard"). So for those laptop normal carrying shouldn't cause any problem (worst case could happen is that the battery drains totally if you constantly shake it and it can't hibernate). If you have anything other set to wake up laptop (wireless mouse, installation...) those will of course wake it up from sleep. I've also a Windows 7 laptop, I set "hibernate after" to 2 hours, I carry it sleeping during the day and I hibernate it for the night. 

Not the most elegant solution, but you can e.g. look for words longer than e.g. 3 characters, this will exclude majority of your issues. 

You follow the wrong logic, checking the criteria outside of won't work. Instead of use INDEX and MATCH, that way you can create a more flexible formula: 

Your only chance is if you can place two routers which can "see" each other without any object between them, that case just look for two routers with 150 m range and that will work (and probably they will be outdoor, so that's also a criteria). As I write this it's the only chance, you won't find a router sending signals through 37 layers of ceiling. 

At first, I fully agree with @Raystafarian, Excel isn't the right tool for that. However, if you really want to do it here, here is a solution with a few helper columns: 

I think most elegant way to do this with a pivot table: Set your name column as column label, set your number column as values and select to summarise it by minimum. 

The formula for this column is: . That will display "original store number" if it's included in the "reduce store number" column, else it'll be empty. After it you can filter for numbers in the new column and copy data to a new sheet. 

Both formulas are array formulas, so you need to enter them by CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. When you create your formulas, you need to be very careful to include ranges with the same number of cells. 

Answer for part 1. of your question: Your formulas were close, just you need to add another condition: 

I've replaced my pc just a couple of weeks ago, and the previous one had the same issue too (same software & versions). I suppose there is another program installed interfering with the shortcut, how can I find it? 

Probably you can also download the driver from the internet so you don't need CD reader to install it (or ask somebody with working driver to copy it for you). 

You don't need to use VBA for this, just use a pivot table. By default you'll not get values duplicated (first pivot table in screenshot). If you need them duplicated, then you need to add a helper column in your data to make values different depending on value, e.g.: 

Use a named range: named ranges are shifted together with cells, so referring them will always refer to the same cells. 

The only difference from previous one is the first parameter of , which is the same formula used within small to find data in the selected row instead in the title. Both formulas are array formulas, so you need to enter them by CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER 

go to the first cell of "emp name" press CTRL+down - this will go to the last row of your data press right to go to "sal_date" column press CTRL+SHIFT+up - now your whole column is selected press CTRL+D - this fills down the formula if you want to convert formulas to constant values: CTRL+C then in ribbon select paste - values 

This will highlight your search term, but also everything before it in the same line. Notepad++ uses POSIX REGEX which unfortunately doesn't support lookbehind. 

Now you can select your helper column, F5 - special - check "formula" and unmark "number", this selects all the empty rows. Just right click on one of them and delete - entire row. 

I use Oracle SQL Developer (version 17.3.1.279) in Windows 10 64 bit. It's connected to an Oracle database in the network through TNS. Whenever I open "query builder" first time for a query, or after some changes in the SQL code it takes a lot of time (30-60 s) to load. Also "completion insights" appear very slow (3-4 s), so I generally just finish typing table and column names before they appear (setting is 0.6 s for them to appear). Based on above issues, I suspect SQL developer each time reads information from the database. Is there a way to make it store information locally instead? (structure of the database is quite permanent, it changes less then once a year) 

Troubleshooting formulas can be difficult, and already to find a direction to start may not be easy. 

It also works correctly if text contains numbers, keeps everything until the last letter in the description. 

Instead of considering each score equally, give them different weight based on the total achievable score. 

This formula works for each year, start of fiscal year at 1st of February and start of second week at 2nd are "hard coded" in the formula. 

You can move pictures with arrows, but I don't think you can change their order. A solution could be just to cut it (CTRL+X) then paste it (CTRL+V) to the new location. So moving the image without mouse (rearranging from A B D C to A B C D): 

Put this formula in any column, starting from first row, fill down at least for ten rows to get correct result in case all numbers need to be displayed. This is an array formula, you need to enter it with CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. 

Here is a formula, it counts all occurrences of the customer number where DM is not "no donation" and it's not empty (to avoid false counts when you add new rows). 

Whenever I try to drag and drop a table from the left column (e.g. ) to the query builder, it opens the table as a new tab (next to "start page" and "AllTAbles.sql") I need to activate my query again, and only the second attempt to drag works (this is consistent, always the second one works). 

Most probably NO. Both brands probably uses proprietary communication protocols which are not harmonized (no business interest of any of the companies to do so). (If you have a docking station in your office, you can store it's receiver there, and long term solution could be to stick to the same brand) 

Note: adding empty line between records didn't work for me through pivot table settings, but you can always add an empty column to your source data and include it in the pivot table too. 

In Word go to - File - Options - Proofing In Autocorrect tab remove mark from "Correct accidental usage of cAPS LOCK key". This is a general setting, if you'd prefer to keep it, then you can also create an autocorrect rule (at the bottom of the same form): Replace "idin?" to "iDIN?", this way just type it with lowercase letters and Word will automatically convert it to the right form. 

make sure your data has titles go to insert tab - pivot table (this can be slightly different based on you Excel version) move first column's header to "row labels" move second column's header to both "column headers" and "values" 

You can't achieve it with column settings, instead: To make the first column in the first page just insert a table of one cell (or a text box, that will do the same) 

As commented already, even with a macro it's not possible to prevent excel from starting a formula. If you really want one keystroke and leave the cell then you need to change from + and - characters e.g. to "p" and "n" and you get get a macro which change them to your desired output when you finishing editing of cell content. Other workaround could be to type 0 and 1 and change them with conditional formatting. 

Instead of "cell value" select "use a formula to determine which cell to format", then for the formula enter: Where is the address of the active cell of the selected range (e.g. A1) Update For easier management of references: 

select a cell in your data, go to insert - pivot table, click ok add all columns as column headers select all data in your pivot table and CTRL+C (copy) paste special - values and number formatting to a new location
