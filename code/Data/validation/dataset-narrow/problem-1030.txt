I'm running Firefox on Arch Linux, and my support for international fonts is very limited. This results in a lot of tofu on web pages: 

I'm interested in abandoning OS X in favour of ElementaryOS, a Linux distribution. Before I do that, I want to know about any "gotchas" which would make installing Linux on a Retina MacBook Pro different from installing it on other hardware. The two possible hangup points in my mind are: 

I'd actually figured this out a little while back by installing Google's Noto fonts. I'm not at my Arch box right now, but under Fedora these are available in the repos as for the lot of them. 

And right now, you somehow logically ensure that P can not access L or I but only other Ps? And because P has physical access to AP you want to prevent what happens P presses the reset button. The problem is, someone with physical access to the AP could just pull out the cable and connect directly to your network and attack it. So doing some clever configuration on the AP does not help. What you want is a setup where the router manages who can access what on your network. (assuming P can not physically access R) There are several possibilities to achieve security here. One would be using VLANs. So setting each port of R where an AP is connected to belong to some specific VLAN (Access port). It would not work if the AP would do the VLAN tagging, because then the attacker could try to tag his own packets to belong to another VLAN. This would be called trunk port. You could use this tutorial as a primer on VLANs: $URL$ 

I'm trying to set up to run a shell script, but for some reason, the script doesn't get executed. I'm on system with OS X 10.8.5. file 

This server was a Raspberry Pi connected over gigabit ethernet to the modem/router. Once again, notice the spikes. It's not unusual for longer ping tests to have 5-10% packet loss, either. What could be causing these symptoms? I'm almost sure it's the modem/router; I've tried connecting a downstream router broadcasting a different network, but the issue persists both for local and non-local hosts. 

I'd like to know if these are indeed things to worry about, and how (if?) I can get around them. I'd also like to know if there's anything else I should look out for during the installation. My OS X version is 10.11.5. 

So, basically I am outputting the result of the first operation to and pipe it into another pdftk process and so on untill I am done. Is there a better way of doing this with only one pdftk process? Operations used are: and range selections on the pages. 

Since the stick works fine on the TV (which often use linux-based operating systems) and does not work in Windows, I would guess it is a partitioning issue. Use some partitioning tool (e.g., gparted or Partition Master) and check the partitioning. Things to look for: 

Obviously one could also use a binary code, or have multiple domains meaning the same, etc. etc. Conclusion This are just some of many methods that an attacker could use to transmit information to the outside world. Obviously one could combine some of these methods and also use encryption and/or obfuscation to make detection harder. Therefore preventing uploading via the browser is more or less useless. 

I'm trying to get my Arch Linux installation to recognize a Kobo Aura H2O e-reader. I've connected it via USB, which starts charging the reader. Usually within a second or two, the reader itself asks whether to connect to the computer, which I allow it to do. After this, the reader doesn't show up as a mounted or unmounted drive, though. I've tried to look at the output of , but it doesn't show up there, either. Finally, I can't find it under . My OS is installed on a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro. How can I get my computer to recognize this e-reader? 

I have an apache webserver (shared hosting) where I have access to If I place a in it gets applied to all subdirectories. The domain belonging to this has several subdomains that link to subdirectories of this webspace. I want to use authentication for some of the subdomains, whereas the main page should be password-free. e.g.: 

Does anyone have an idea what I do wrong? I tried iperf3 versions 3.0.7 and 3.0.12 *In the end I want to ensure that some low-bandwidth connections are preferred over anything else in the network. 

A good reason would be to use multiple monitors. Most of today's graphic cards have 2-3 physical monitor connectors (althou some could provide the image for more). But also many mainboards have grapic cards (or use the cpu for that) and have their own minitor connectors. So, it depends on how many monitors you want to connect. Another reason would be to use the GPU for computations. This basically boils down to the question: does your software support using multiple GPUs for computation and can your computation-problem (a game can be seen as a computation problem) benefit from such a setup. If, for example, you want to do bitcoin-mining, the more hardware the better - but if you just want to play some 3D game, it will probably not support this and therefore not benefit from it. 

I have a small home network with a Hitron modem/router (model number CGN3ACSMR, software version 4.5.8.22). Since having the router installed a month ago, I've been experiencing some odd latency patterns, both when accessing hosts outside my LAN as well as when trying to access hosts on my LAN. It's not usually intrusive, but it makes SSH annoying, and it prevents me from hosting certain services (games, streaming API servers, etc.) on my network. Here's a dump of to , done from my laptop, connected over the modem/router's 5GHz network: 

I'm working on a computer with extremely limited internal storage, so I want to set up pip and my Python environment so that new packages are installed to an SD card (which is going to be inside the machine all the time anyway) by default. Does pip provide this kind of functionality? 

Probably not, but BitTorrent (BT) might still be a good idea for your problem. BT divides large files into chunks (so-called pieces) and calculates SHA1 hashes for each piece. Pieces can be loaded individually of each other (out of order and also in parallel). After a piece is downloaded completely(!) the SHA1 is checked and if a corruption is found the piece is discarded and downloaded again. The size of a piece is variable but per-determined by the torrent creator. The default value piece size 256 KiB. Larger torrents usually use larger piece sizes. For example the ubuntu 16.04 ISO (1.3 GiB) uses 512 KiB. The Caine 7.0 ISO (2.9 GiB) uses 1 MiB. So, if your piece size is not that big, bittorrent will achieve what you desire. To save bandwidth, maybe you want to disable some BT features like DHT and PeX and rely only on trackers. You might also want to limit the number of parallel connections and the number of parallel pieces, in order to complete a piece before your connection might break. (I think this can be achieved with the "in order" setting of qBittorrent) Also many clients (like qBittorrent) can also use HTTP sources in addition to the torrent protocol. Althou I am not sure if they also to the piece checksum thing for HTTP sources. 

Notice the 100+ms spikes showing up periodically. Here are the (very similar) results of pinging an address on my LAN, once again done from my laptop: 

I have a 2012 Retina MacBook Pro running Arch Linux with GNOME. Normally, I listen to music using the analog audio I/O interface -- the 3.5mm socket. Recently, I had to attach a USB microphone to the laptop. While doing that, I used the microphone's built-in 3.5mm socket to monitor the sound I was recording with lower latency and less distortion than what the laptop's internal amplifier, and the backing software, would produce. Because of this, I went into GNOME's sound options and updated the audio output profile to digial, which allowed me to pipe system sounds through the mic and into my headphones while I was monitoring the audio received by the microphone. After switching back to using the 3.5mm socket on my laptop and reverting the audio output profile to analog (the only option available without the mic), the outputted audio's really distorted. After some tinkering using the ALSA mixer and reproduction of the issue on the laptop's main speakers, I've concluded that the issue is that outputting audio to my headphones now results in the bass part of the spectrum being cut off completely, resulting in a tinny, distorted, and almost downsampled effect. Unfortunately, I haven't found any settings allowing me to tweak the bass response for the 3.5mm out. Where can I do this system-wide? 

Use a regexp to have every sentence on a new line. This can be done (for example) be searching for all and replacing them with Remove all whitespaces at the beginning of the line. Now go ahead and sort the lines (TextFX -> TextFX Tools) Convert the EOL character to UNIX because ot makes things simpler (Edit -> EOL conversion) Now search for duplicated lines by searching for 

Question: what should happen with non-HTTP traffic in the wireless network? Apart from that, you will have to do certain things: 

Bonus question: how big will the partition created by be? Will it be ? My intention is to not use the full size of the disk but to limit myself to 3 TB in order to be able to replace a failed drive with a different model. Do I need if I have aligned partitions? Is it useless? Does it harm me somehow? What about the stripsize? Do I need to modify it? What if I use 5 disks instead of 4 disks? Is there anything else what I should consider?
