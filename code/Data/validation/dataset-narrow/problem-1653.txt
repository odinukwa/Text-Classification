This is simplified drawing to show you idea. Maybe you should build something like toilet reservoir valve: 

I have Raspberry with Raspbian and RaspBMC (installed from NOOBS). I use Raspbian without monitor, keyboard and mouse at my workshop. SSH, apache and samba is all I need to interact with PI there. Sometimes I take my Pi to use it at home with RaspBMC. I connect it to TV and mouse. Sometimes I forgot reboot Raspberry and choose Raspbian to use Raspbian at workshop and I end with XBMC. The question is: Where "last operating system used" is stored? How can I reboot into Raspbian when RaspBMC is running? I have SSH enabled on XBMC. 

(image source: link) If you need digital signal (when specyfic level is reached) - you can use simple switch. If you need analog value - use potentiometer. 

What a nonsense. If someone has 4GB card he can just remove folders from folder after unzipping NOOBS. 

According to this and this Raspberry Pi B+ has 600mA current limiter and it can be changed to 1.2A (1200mA) by software (in config.txt file). And you don't have to use big and ugly powered USB hub to put more power into your USB device. You can split USB cable or make some adapter and connect +5V device line directly to +5V from your power supply. I have something like this: 

So you can set up wifi via the cmd line by editing the /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf file with the following: 

If you can download and install an SSH client for your phone then sure. But then one would wonder what exactly you could do at that point. There are plenty of options for all major Mobile OS's. I have used JuiceSSH and for android and it works well $URL$ The SSH Client for Windows Moible: $URL$ And surely there is something for IOS Most of the clients work about the same, you enter your IP address of your Raspberry Pi, then enter the username and password in the required fields. 

So I have set up a webcam with $URL$ on my Rpi due to some recent vandalism and opened up the appropriate ports to view my camera while away from home. I know there are other things that affect the bandwidth usage such as amounts of activity and resolution and a few other things. So my question is because I have limited bandwidth usage every month, I want to make sure that data is only being uploaded to the internet when there is an active request by the client? Is this correct or do I need to rethink having it available online? Let me know please. 

I'm using multiple Raspberry Pi devices. I use one for RPi software development (I'm programmer), one for multimedia (RaspBMC), and one for other purposes. The way I'm moving files to these devices and manage them from PC is not productive. I would like to use one of cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox or maybe something else) to sync all devices with folders on my PC, so I can just put files in folder on PC and wait until these files will be synchronized with RPi. I want to create directory structures like this (or similar): PC: 

Yes, Raspberry Pi can handle a lot of LEDs. Building 5m strip (with that many separate "channels") is more challenging. 

I just downloaded current version of NOOBS (1.3.10) and there is only one operating system (Raspbian). After zip file unpacking - I see that there os only Raspbian in folder. NOOBS 1.3.8 version was 1.4GB, current version is about 700MB. Anyone knows what is going on? 

My power supply is a bit diffrent, but it has two USB outputs too. You don't need this with B+ model, but it's good to know. 

Two of my RPi devices have Raspbian. One is RaspBMC. I'm already using Google Drive and Dropbox services. If there is something else for my needs - I can give it a try). My question is: Which cloud service will be easier to configure for my needs and work on both - Raspbian and RaspBMC? I'm using Windows 7 on my PC and current versions of Raspbian and RaspBMC on Raspberry devices. 

Personally, this is my favorite method of shutting down my Rpi2. $URL$ Essentially it allows you to shut down your pi with a paper clip, or another conductive object. You could probably modify this to work with a button. Basically, you touch to GPIO headers and the pi runs the shutdown command. Pretty cool if you ask me...Not as elegant as a button but it still works. 

My guess is that you are not meeting the power requirements for the Raspberry Pi 2. The Raspberry Pi Foundation recommends at least 1.8w of power for the Rpi2. Not having enough power can cause seemingly random behavior like you are describing. Please see here for details for more details. $URL$ 

Jesse Lite does not include the GUI it is just the core OS. Thus when you put in your username and password you get the terminal. This is very useful for headless servers that you can communicate with SSH. Or you can hook a display up to it and use it that way. Advantages... Lower performance overhead, and uses less disk space. and if configured correctly you can stick it in a closet and forget about it... Why would one use this? Example, Well I just finished a project where I put up a security camera (usb) outside, ran the USB cable into my garage, and to a Raspberry Pi, that is connected to my network via WIFI. Also, you could use this for a web server, DNS server and all sorts of things (limited only by your imagination). Good news though. You have two options, you can download the regular Raspian Jesse, or you can install LXDE. To install it just type the following command after you log in:
