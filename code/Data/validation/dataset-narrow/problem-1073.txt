Update: You have routers with built-in ethernet switches (pretty common nowadays for small-office/home routers). So you can probably use the "secondary router" as a dumb switch and save yourself a lot of problems. 

WinSCP can be used to schedule updates using FTP. Normally you want files to be overwritten if, and only if, the local copy has a more recent modification time. See WinSCP's synchronize command 

To do what you ask using only built-in tools I'd look at powershell. Here is an example from powershellcommunity.org which you could use as a starting point. 

Yes, see USB protocols As I understand it, the USB spec defines a complex set of layered protocols and device profiles. For example, USB devices can conform to high-level templates like mass-storage, keyboard (or Human Interface Device, etc) and be managed by a generic device driver. Some USB devices can communicate at a lower level such that the OS low level USB support can recognise that device-specific higher level drivers are needed. 

If you really want to print just the lastname, and not the whole line, you should consider using awk (or perl) 

Wget does stop when dd breaks the pipe but the resulting file isn't the right size. So maybe just let it run, manually stop it and cut the part you need (e.g. using dd) Finally you can chop the non-zero part of the file on computer 1 (e.g. using dd) copy to computer 2 and cat the pieces together. 

If the file was encrypted when it was deleted then any recoverable data is still in encrypted form. This assumes file-level encryption. The answer would be different for a plain file placed into an encrypted filesystem. 

A headset will eliminate the possibility of feedback problems. Your friends may notice the benefit more than you do. Latency in the system may mean that your microphone feeds back to them a delayed echo of what they have just said. This can be very difficult to talk over. 

Check if the package manager knows about nginx, if it does, use that package manager to uninstall it. 

"UltraDMA 133/100/66/33" means Parallel ATA (PATA) historically known as just "IDE". So you have two controllers, each of which controls two SATA connectors. The main controller also controls two IDE connectors. Each of the IDE connectors supports up to two devices. The BIOS description is "SATA controller mode: [IDE] or [RAID]": My initial guess was that "IDE" refers to a pair of internal PATA (IDE) connector for the VIA 8237A controller and that "RAID" refers to a pair of internal SATA connectors for the same controller. In that case You could probably only be using one or the other pair of connectors at a time. I now suspect that 

Note that you reverse the order of the four numbers and append Remember that an IP-address may have multiple domains, and that the administrators do not always (but mostly should) set up the reverse mappings in DNS. 

So you could restrict certain PCs to this guest zone, with time-based access. There may be other features in the manual that would accomplish what you want. â€  Google for "DIR-825 manual" 

But if the site is not static, has password protected areas or contains forms, you are not going to be able to retrieve all of it easily. If you need to count all the words on, say Amazon, you might need to top up the credit card associated with your one-click account :-) 

The above shows how characters are separated but has rather idealised rise and fall times, I believe a scope would show something more like what follows (note inverted mark/space axis compared with prior diagram). 

See $URL$ for getting the machine to boot Xen You should note that CentOS' upstream source (RedHat) have dropped Xen and support KVM. To install KVM and then install some management tools for it: 

With DOS and perhaps early versions of Windows, I believe there were some problems (which I don't recall) with using quote marks which led to people using printable characters in this way. I haven't tried the case where %1 contains a quote mark for example. 

I have a client app that accesses an HTTPS web-service. It uses an external library for SSL support. The service provider has advised they are dropping SSL 3 support and, from a specific date, will only support TLS 1.0 (or later) connections. I can configure the client to, for example, access a test web-server on my PC (or a Linux server) using an HTTPS GET request. How can I set up a test service, using something like Apache, or maybe Perl, to positively test whether the client supports TLS 1.0 or later? 

KeePass can import from CSV, so export from RTF to text (to remove the bold and other formatting), then use something like Perl (or your favourite scripting language) to convert to CSV. Perl is very good for this, but it probably isn't worth learning Perl just to convert 70 records. 

None. This is partly because "all major formats" is not a well defined list. You could make a list of the formats of interest to you, for each format identify a command that will check it. The command might be a conversion to another format where the output is to a null file or one that is subsequently deleted. Then write a script to apply appropriate command to all files, detect failure and delete or separate files that fail. 

etc Syntax highlighting only works for files that vim recognises as being a file for which it has a set of highlighting rules. If you read vim's help, you can find out how to add your own highlighting rules files 

Current versions of the most popular browsers support (most of) Unicode (so long as you have fonts available that contain glyphs for the scripts you want to render). You need to make sure your web-server provides the appropriate character-set and encoding indications in HTTP headers and/or in HTML. See Wikipedia, Unicode consortium and Alan Wood 

This often works better than inserting arbitrary page breaks. When adding text to an earlier paragraph you don't get blank pages or other odd pagination effects. 

is a program specific to my development environment but you may have (or be able to construct) something equivalent. I'm assuming you've tried obvious techniques such as 

If you don't pipe the output of your commands into something like , you will be able to use Putty's scroll-bars to view earlier output. Putty has settings for how many lines of past output it retains in it's buffer. 

You should be able to substitute for in Inkscape. There is an extension for font replacement Complete Guide to Pre-Installed Fonts in Linux, Mac, and Windows 

If the program must be run with the current working directory set to the directory containing the program you can combine both commands on one line: 

On the server, if Windows, you can use Windows Explorer to select a folder and share it (use the right-click context-menu) If you don't belong to a Windows Domain (you'd know if you did) you just have to make sure both computers are in the same workgroup and (ideally) have the same usernames and (ideally) passwords. 

At the moment I have private keys for these in separate PPK files. I have shortcuts to these on the desktop - so clicking the desktop icon launches Pageant and prompts for a password. After doing this for each PPK file, I can log in and out of the server(s) multiple times during the day using various user-ids without entering passwords. So far so good. Could I streamline this further by somehow combining all these PPK files into a single PPK file? If so how? 

If you are worried about someone misusing information on your computer, you should take a broader look at security options available 

Review the full list and choose the most appropriate. If the server is capable of returning an XML document detailing the error then it is normal to do so. The SOAP Services I use have this allowed for in the service definitions. The client has to be able to cope with unadorned HTTP errors as sometimes a server fault occurs before the request XML is even parsed. 

You could change 5555 to 23 (Telnet's default port number) Change /bin/myscript to your VLC script or binary. 

To change the meaning of those keys, you must install a suitable driver. Windows 8.1 drivers sometimes work on Windows 10. You may be able to do some remapping using some other generic driver or keyboard/scancode remapping tool. 

Use to check that NTP is operating. Remember, NTP is designed for continuous operation and may take considerable time to settle at an accurate value. Note that NTP software doesn't like making huge adjustments in time so it is worth checking that both operating systems have the same ideas about how the motherboard RTC is interpreted. Typically this is used at startup to set the Linux system clock. e.g. in /etc/default/rcS 

A CD laser head has a working distance of 2.1mm, the mechanism maintains this distance dynamically in order to keep the laser beam focussed on the reflective layer in the disk. Unless your scratched CD has scratches deeper than a millimetre or ploughed ridges greater than a millimetre it is unlikely that there will be physical contact. My Kill Bill volume 1 is 1.2 mm thick, this is typical for optical disks. So I suspect it would be hard to gouge the disk sufficiently to cause problems and still have something that you'd have any reason to put into your DVD drive. 

Regex syntax varies from application to application. I am unfamiliar with Ultredit and will give a generaql anser Your regex lacks capturing parentheses ([0-9]+),[0-9]+,([0-9]+) 

No that isn't possible. It's a hardware issue. The electronic circuitry attached to a microphone jack differs from the electronic circuitry attached to a line-out, headphone-out or speaker-out jack. 

The lp command works, I'm not really concerned about not being able to on /home - that's a security feature I like. 

This sort of issue is why I only buy printers that support PCL5 and Postscript (or emulations of these) - I still have enough problems with printers. 

If you manually log in to those servers using Putty, click the "Yes" button on that dialog, Putty will cache the server key so those dialogs will not pop up on subsequent connections (unless you reinstall ssh on the server or change the server's key) You can use plink, a command-line version of Putty, that should not pop-up these dialogs (or use openssh) I haven't used plink.
