Here you can reach the internet from all vlans. Now, because you want to deny access from one vlan to another, you need to create access list and applied to the subinterfaces that you created on router: Eg: 

You need to remember that always will be an implicit DENY into every access-list. On the same way, if you put a deny statement onyour route-map, something like this: 

Your first ponit is rigth, you need to separate each Point to Poin link between routers in one subnet, like you said: Eg: 

Mainly, network services running on devices like servers, pc, voip phones, are associated to ports, eg: 80 for http, 443 for https, 21 for ftp, 22 for ssh. Those are well known ports, ther are lower than 1024. The thing is, by security reason, on edge devices, are places some access list to protect internal users, on that, are blocked traffic destinated to ports (mainly well known ports), that can compromise some system. Then , when you request some web page and made a request to some server on 80 port, the request from your machine is generated on sone port upper 1024, that it's not listening for nothing, but your application, on this case, your iexplorer, or mozilla, or chrome, has the possibility to open and send a receive traffic accross then, and once you get what you want, close it. I guess you need to learn and read about osi model and networking, you can begin with Computer Networks, by Tanembaun, it is a GREAT start point for you, and this stuff is easily explained. 

The ttl(time to live) value will depend of the initial value of your ttl field(that is depending of your operatins system). Here you can find some common values: $URL$ If you are using windows(not 95 version)127 will be your result because it is just one jump has happens, the ttl value change(decrease) on the way that a packes passes by one router or some devices betwenn 2 networks. On that way, once the packet get into router b, and it forwarded to router A, on that moment the ttl value is dereceased by one. 

The port of the switch connected to the firewall and the AP must be located on the same VLAN like "Access Ports". You must configure your AP on the way that be a bridge between your LAN and wifi users, on the way to provide the IP address gives by your Firewall and not by your AP. 

Yes, UTP permit it. In fact, this is the access mode with Ethernet works. A collision occurs when two or more devices on a network attempt to transmit over a single data channel (e.g., a twisted pair copper wire cable or an optical fiber cable) simultaneously. It is detected by all participating devices, and, after a brief, random, and different interval of time (called a backoff delay) has elapsed for each device, the devices attempt to transmit again. If another collision occurs, the time intervals from which the random waiting times are selected are increased step-by-step in a process referred to as exponential back off. CSMA/CD is a modification of pure CSMA. Carrier sense refers to the fact that a transmitting device listens for a carrier wave (i.e., a waveform that carries signals) before attempting to transmit. That is, it first tries to detect the presence of an encoded signal from another device. If a carrier is sensed, the device waits for the transmission in progress to finish before starting its own transmission. Multiple access describes the fact that multiple devices send and receive on the medium. Transmissions by one node are generally received by all other nodes using the medium. Collision detection is used to improve CSMA performance by terminating transmission as soon as a collision is detected, and reducing the probability of a second collision on the next try. The techniques used for detecting collisions depend on the type of media: in the case of electrical wires, for example, collisions are detected by comparing the transmitted data with the received data. CSMA/CD operates at the physical layer is the bottom level in the OSI (open systems interconnection) seven layer model, which is used to standardize and simplify definitions with regard to computer networks. This layer defines all physical and electrical specifications for devices used to interface to the network, and it deals with data only in terms of raw bits (i.e., it does not recognize MAC addresses, IP addresses and packets). A major feature of CSMA/CD is that it is simple to implement. This has helped make it an international standard and an important part of the ethernet, which is the most widely deployed architecture for LANs (local area networks). 

Repeaters works on Layer 1 of OSI model and Bridges works on Layer 2. The main thing that repeaters does is to REPEAT the signal from one side to other, it no taken on mind destination or something else, it just repeat the signal to the other ports. On the other hand, bridges conmunicate 2 networks from different topologies. This one also works matching the destination MAC address, to send or not, the transmition to that network segment. Bridges are more like a switch, a small switch, a 2 port switch. I´m not have any price, but i think bridges DO NOT cost more that repeaters, the contrary, because, with the repeaters you can connect a lot of equipments, it have about 8, 16 ports, and bridges only have 2 interfaces, on the way to EXTEND and separate a collision domain into 2. 

You probarly need to enable SNMP on your devices, with the correct community, unless you do that, no response could be received by your SCOM. If you already done this, then you can check on the logs of your devices to see if SNMP request are received, and some kind of error, if happens. It is not, you need to check if the SNMP default port, 161, are been filtered in some place. Remember, this is only a global answer, every equipment have it owns steps to configure SNMP. If yow can't resolve, you can edit your question and put devices model. 

I think the @Ron Trunk´s answer it is great for you, and, for your notation, everytime that a packet arrives to a router and is routing by some interfaces, in that moment, the source mac address field change by the owner mac address of that port, allowing fast connectivity by l2. In fact, on the moment that the packet arrives to it destination, it comes with the source mac address of the gateway of the destination network. You can look in a easy and safe way that whe are talking about if you simulate with packet tracert, gns3,... and capture the traffic and compare the mac address. Mac address are for l2 connectivity like ip address are for l3 connectivity 

You need to be sure that you are connected to a trunk port, only with this you will receive tagged frames. On that way, you can connect your PC and with wireshark, sniff the traffic with IP 0.0.0.0, it means ALL traffic. I think you can take your traffic and see what you want with this scenario. 

If all connected devices can conmmunicate each other, then you should see if you have put the default gateway in all your pcs. Also, if your switch are capable, can put some loopback interfaces in, eg, your gigabit switch 1, to troubleshoot from here to your network, and tried a ping test from here to your pc, notice that this ip address mus be in the same network of your equipment. From here, you need to review your connectivity, and see if you are good with the distances for UTP(100 meters) and cable types used(crossover cables for the connections between switches) 

First, you really need to find some good books to clear your concepts, i recommend you Computers Networks, by Tanenbaum, the best of best for me. On the other hand, the OSI model look some like this: Equipment1 Equipment2 Application --- Application Presentacion -- Presentacion Session ----- Session Transport ----- Transport Network ----- Network Data Link ----- Data Link Physical ****** Physical The principle is that the upper layers send the data to the lower layers, until de physical layer, that is on charge to transmit the info in form of ligth, or electromagnetic waves. But, all the upper layer only spoke with it same on the other equipment. To transmit data, by eg: from the lower middle of equipment 1, segments of data are created on the transport layer, and passes to the network layer, when are added some things and the IP header, and then pakets area created with that info. Then it passes to de Data Link layer where occurred some proccess and frames is the result, that are passed to the Physical Layer where all of that are transmitted like BITS, "zeros and ones". On the other side, the invert proccess is carried out, and everyone of the Layer proccess his info. The SYN that you are asking is send to the other machine and until is not proccesed, that machine not send it SYN,ACK to the origin machine. Again, you can read this in one easily form on the Tanenbaum book 

You can use a free firewall solution that can do great things on your scenario. Like you said, sever is 10 Gb capable, then get the software and install it. With that you will have a router, if you need it, and the main thing, a firewall. Put the IP on your WAN interface, and the same on your LAN interface. At this point, you need t create a static route across your WAN link: 0.0.0 0.0.0.0 next-hop(ip_of_your_isp) 

Seems to be a network loop my friend, you must check the logs on the switch, and see was wrong, looking mac address flaping or something like that 

I have a practical doubt. Can someone explain to me if i can connect 2 networks equipments using XFP and SFP+, MM the two, accross a SM fiber, ´cause i recently made the escenario and did not work. The 2 connectors, XFP and SFP+ work on 850 nm, on a distance of 300m, every of that a just checked. The link never came up, but the same link where connected to other slot using 1Gb SFP and instantly came UP. 

You need to take in mind that interface counters will save it numbers, what you see on that is the last "Total output drops" meassure by the interfaces on the past where it was UP. If you want to check a new link, you need to clear the number, try: 

If you are using a switch, i guess the only passive option to sniff the traffic for/from that machine is configuring port mirroring(on a capable switch) on the interface connected to that device. There is another way, an ACTIVE scenario called MITM, man in the middle, where you need to spoof the device identity for the switch point of wiew, receiving and sendig your own data, and the device data, to de other people. But i recommend you the first option, the second has some "deep legal stuff", cause you are able to "change" the information sended a received from that device. 

First, Wireshark need to be listening on one interface. When you open Wireshark, there is a list of availables interfaces on your host, physical NICs and Virtual ones, what you need to do is select the specific virtual interface. With that, the packets must be listed. 

interface vlan 10 ip address x.x.10.x 255.255.255.0 interface vlan 20 ip address x.x.20.x 255.255.255.0 

I guess you need to check if some kind of NATing is needed of if this is part of you ISP provider. It is not, you need to configure NAT on your router. 

With this, the route map will never will do nothing 'cause the deny statement. If you want that a route map try to match something, your statement need to be a permit on some way. 

It can reach the two networks, but, your modem router, only knows that it wil connect to internet across the serial link or something like this, i´m talking about the link connected with the cloud. Then, the same happens when the modem receive a packet from an equipment located in the network 192.168.10.0/24. The modem knows this network cause it has connected DIRECLTY. YOU MUST ADD some route on your modem router with destination 192.168.1.0/24 across gateway 192.168.1.69/24. This is the way that packets from 192.168.1.0 will be reply to that destination. The problem is this, the REQUEST arrive without problem, but the modem UNKNOWN the location of the network 192.168.1.0/24. 

First you need to check which is the interface that isn presenting the flapping event. Then you can write: 

You can create access-list, that can be applied on the interfaces in outgoing direction, matching some traffic with the IP that you need. Also you can work with iptables on your server,. but, on the other hand, why you want to use vlans?? 

! Whe you put login local i to line vty 0 4 ! You are refering to all the local users ! Those that you are declared like !username 

First. You need to set-up on your firewall EIGRP(on the way to LEARN all the routes, i thinking It don´t knows how to reach youre second switch), but, STOP, you HAVE a Palo Alto firewall, i know that EIGRP is a Cisco Propietary Routing Protocol, then, you need to set-up a DEFAULT route to Switch1(10.1.70.2). This can be a possible solution to your issue. 

The on switches, you can check by commands by what port switches learn that MAC, and get into the wire until you get what you want. Remember: This is only possible if you have switches with managment capabilities. 

It is correct to say that each of that card, DPC,DPCe and MPC provides packet forwarding engines. Everyone of this card uses this mechanism to forwarding. Several types of DPCs are available. Each DPC includes either two or four Packet Forwarding Engines. Each Packet Forwarding Engine enables a throughput of 10 Gbps. 

Port groups are the ports of the virtual switch that connect to virtual machines, uplink ports are ports of the virtual switch that are mapped to physical link. 

I guess you need to change the first line of your script, and add -f at the end. Then, it must look like this: 

But switch see is x.x.x.y and x.x.x.y2 are on the same network(It has his ARP table who match MAC with IP). If you does a capture, you can see that on the same switch, that if from one network to another, you tried to make a ping request, this one "Who has x.x.x.y? Tell y.y.y.y2" never happens. Switch only conmunicates equipments on the same network 

Example: Client: iperf -c ip_Server Server: iperf -s Also you can change the parameters to do a more strong test
