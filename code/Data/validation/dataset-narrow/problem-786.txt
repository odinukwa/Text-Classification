I use a utility called Eraser. I think it was recommended in some Microsoft TechNet posting or MSDN. And it's totally free. 

For small businesses with less than 10 PCs it's often an overkill to even have a central server, much less buy a Windows Domain Server which costs heaps of cash. However the need remains for people to share files and printers amongst their computers. The standard solution would be to share the folders publicly. But sometimes that can be undesireable, for example if some unauthorized laptops appear in the network regularly. Another solution is to create the same users on all computers (including setting the same passwords). This allows for authorized access, but adding new users or chaning passwords is a pain. It would be great if it was possible to set up one of the machines as a central "user database". Other computers could then authenticate against that computer, and even set permissions on shares. Is this possible somehow? 

I'm using a linux box as a router: The Box has 2 public ips and local ip, i'm using natting to allow local users to access the web. When a local user access the web, source natting happens here, the packets going through the public interface are they checked through the OUTPUT chain or through the Forward chain ? The same Question for the returned packets of the already established session are they check via the INPUT or forward chain ? One last thing: Consider me as a local user the packets will go like this PC ---> LinuxBox Local Interface ---> Linux Box Public interface ----> External world. When the packets come back: External Word ---->Public interface ----> Local interface ----->PC If i want to apply a rule on the packet when they move from the local interface to the PC, should i use the FORWARD chain or the OUTPUT chain ? What do you think ?? 

Is there any software that would test the reliability of a CPU? Like, check how all the instructions are working, verify that cache is not damaged, check for known CPU bugs, etc. I've got a machine in which I suspect that the CPU might be failing, but the symptoms are weird enough that I'm not certain... 

My guess is that it should be at least as good as tapes. Perhaps even better, because the magnetic disk itself is in a contained environment and magnetically shielded. However, I'm pretty sure that nobody really knows what happens to a HDD after, say, 20 years of unuse. It's the same thing as with CD's and DVD's (the archival-grade ones) - they simply haven't been around that long. Well, OK, hard drives were there 20 years ago as well, but comparing them to hard drives of today is pointless. 

You can specify only one GATEWAY, and if you added the GATEWAY in both interfaces files the GATEWAY of the higher interface number will be used as in your case eth1, which is correct from route -n you have displayed. If you want to use multiple GATEWAYS you have to use policy routing as suggested in the previous answer. 

4- Use source natting instead of MASQUARGE which most probably you are using. to nat each group of ips to their specified internet connection. You need to go over the steps i have mentioned above, and search for further info, i took me over a week to make it working but now it takes only 5 mins to set up a new provider. 

It's all about marketing and getting more money for Microsoft. Therefore the desktop versions of Windows have a severe limit on concurrent requests in IIS. Don't know the numbers by heart, but it would choke immediately if used under production load. You can however run 3rd party webservers just fine. I just don't know if any of them support ASP.NET. 

I understand that this question is not OS-specific, right? Under Windows, I tend to give all my machines as few partitions as possible, but no less than two - SYSTEM and DATA. If the machine has two physical disks, then one (smaller) will be SYSTEM, the other DATA. If there is just one disk, I split it in two partitions. The reason for that is just one - when I need to reinstall the machine (and there will be such a time), I don't have to worry about the contents of the SYSTEM partition - I just do a full format on it and a clean install. This of course means that my Documents (and preferrably Desktop too) has to be mapped to a folder on DATA, but that's easy to do, especially on Vista and later. I've also tried making more partitons (like GAMES, MUSIC, MOVIES, etc.) but that only resulted in some of them overflowing into others, creating more mess than order. 

example: ifconfig eth0 192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 add default gw, assuming the gateway is 192.168.1.254 

if you are using windows as client side, i would suggest to netlimiter software as it's easy to use, the tc is hard to configure specially in case of download as you would use polycer shaper. with netlimeter you can control upload and download speed easily, from the client side. 

You can list all available versions of a package and install the desired one or latest: You need to do the following: 

You don't need to mark the packets, To do what are planing to you need the following in the server config file add the following: 

I've got a little private webserver where I have several virtualhosts. I know that it's impossible to assign a certificate to each individual virtualhost, because the server finds out which virtualhost was requested only AFTER the SSL connection has been established. But is it possible to have a single SSL certificate which lists several domains? Or at least a wildcard domain, like *.example.com. If yes, what Linux commands do I have to write to make such a self-signed certificate? Added: To clarify - I have just one IP address for all the virtual hosts. 

Actually, Microsoft Virtual PC already has an option called "Compact virtual disk". Read about it in the help file. However, to achieve the best reduction you will need to zero-fill the empty parts of the disk. For that you will need a third party tool - but there are plenty of those. Just google. Sorry, misread your post. You already tried that. In that case you didn't read the help file hard enough. I quote: 

Yes sure, With raid 0 you will: Enhance performance as blocks are striped. For both read and write operations. You will not gain any redundancy with this raid. 

just solved it, seems to be a routing issue, just marked the packets destined to that port the with ip-rules added them to the desired table.. 

Assuming your public interface is eth1 and local interface is eth0 2- Set natting the natting rule with: 

We are using Elastix as an eFax system, the issue is that when trying to send Arabic text it appeas as "????". The issue appears to be in converting the text to postscript, Elastix uses HylaFax as virtual Fax and Hylafax uses: 

I've got a Linux server I can only connect to remotely. I want to backup it, but it'll have to be over the Internet, and I've chosen Google Drive to hold the backups. The only piece of puzzle I still don't have is how to package and compress all the files. I want compression, because space on the Google Drive is limited, and it would also reduce upload times. I could of course use the standard tar+gzip/bzip, or zip, or maybe even something fancy like 7z for best compression. But what I'm wondering about is this - many of the files that will need to be backed up will be things like JPEG images, which don't compress well at all, no matter which compressor I use. It would be faster if those files were copied to the target archive as-is, rather than compressed. Other files are text files, which compress better with a specialized algorithm (can you tell yet that I'm backing up websites?). Is there some kind of archiver which recognizes such files (by file extension would be fine) and applies a different algorithm for them? I think I've seen one somewhere, but I don't remember which one it was and if it has a Linux version. Or perhaps I'm overthinking this? 

to convert the text to postscrit, The question is that is it possible to support arabic characters in postscript ?? i have checked this function in linux: 

I'm having 2 ISPs, need to balance traffic between the internal users ... Firewall is SRX210 The question is: Each ISP has there own DNS, how to make the dns resolving based on the used ISP? Example: If ISP1 goes down, how to prevent DNS-clients from continuing the trying to resolve using ISP1 DNS ? and how to force using ISP2 DNS ? 

The issue is that, the shell asks for passphrase ? i don't know what is it! Am able to use this key using putty, but not from linux Am I missing something here?
