Hyper-V synthetic interfaces are bound to the hypervisor, and the Hyper-V product has most everything (if not all) you will find on other platforms. Lastly, I would suspect that all vendors are going to end up offering the base Hypervisor for free and the profit will come from management and add-ons. Enterprise virtualization decisions really need to be made with product comparisons and considerations of the product road-map. 

Socket Pooling continues from IIS 5.0 to the current Windows versions. Try disabling the socket pooling and see if you can get your web site working. I ran into this problem and wrote a blog post about it titled Separating IP:PORT Bindings on Windows. 

This design wouldn't require a change to your server deployment, rather just adding a certificate to each site along with a url rewrite rule on your main site. And, don't forget to add the redirect url for remapping from http to https: 

UPDATE 2: MySQL is configured as a service (part of the install process, nothing I did) and executes the following syntax (as it appears in the registry): 

Don't forget about your network interface needs. You might want to have at least two interfaces (our four for load balance/redundancy) so that you can have the Host communicating through a different interface than the VM's. You could also consider dedicated interfaces for certain VM's to avoid network bottlenecks for things like SQL and Exchange... 

It sounds like you might be running into an issue with Socket Pooling. From Microsoft's technical whitepapers: 

Exporting a certificate's public and private key is built into Windows, as long as you imported the certificate with the "Allow Export" flag set... In case you have a certificate that doesn't allow you to export the private key you can use a third party tool to extract the private key... iSEC Partners wrote a tool called Jailbreak that allows you to export "locked" certificates... I wrote up a review of it on my blog... 

The Basic Tier is free. It provides basic features, a moderate allotment of logs, and access to built-in metrics. If you try using metrics other than the built-in ones, you may get this error. As per this documentation the Monitoring agent's metrics are only available with the Stackdriver Premium service tier. 

If you want to create a backup of your VM instance which includes your E-commerce (Magento) and have the VM backup include files, configuration files, databases in the VM disk, orders info, etc, you can create a snapshot of your VM as per the following snapshot documentation link. This documentation will guide you to create a snapshot backup of your instance persistent disk which will include the VM instance configuration file and database if hosted locally, depending on your configuration. To create a snapshot: 

This error appears to suggest that you’re using the Stackdriver Basic Tier which allows ‘Logging agent only’ as per the documentation, section ‘Stackdriver account service tiers’. I presume you would need the Premium Tier: 

Are you trying to sftp into a GKE Docker container? Have you checked that your firewall rule has the correct priority set and that no other rule above it is hampering you efforts? 

If you want to have full copies of your VM disks regularly, you can consider creating custom images of your (boot) disks, as explained in this public documentation. 

As this GCP public documentation states, Snapshots are incremental and automatically compressed, so you can create regular snapshots on a persistent disk faster and at a much lower cost than if you regularly created a full image of the disk: 

Navicat for MySQL (there are also Oracle and PostgreSQL versions too). Not free though. US$179 for the downloadable version ($189 for the CD). Highly recommended for all MySQL DBAs and developers using MySQL. There is a trial version available as well. 

One way: add xerox_1600n to your network's DNS infrastructure (the internal/local DNS servers your client machines use) . It won't "magically pop-up," but it will resolve when entered. 

I want to sysprep a Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 machine that has SQL Server 2008 R2 SP1 installed (for reference, SQL Server 2008 R2 has a new sysprep feature that allows the instance to be sysprepped). On the server is a SQL Server client alias that points to the default SQL Server database engine instance. For reference, the alias is called Alias-SQLServer and has been configured in both 32-bit and 64-bit cliconfig versions (that is, both registry keys exist) The alias points to the local instance as the image will be used to create development VMs and the installation script for the application that is being developed will use the SQL Server client alias in order to generalize the installation scripts. I can't seem to find information about whether the sysprep tool will update the SQL Server client alias's registry keys with the server's new name once it's unsealed. My guess is that it is not; how is sysprep to know that the server name the alias points to will be different for each image? Right? Perhaps if the alias points to localhost instead of the server name this will work? 

If I provide a credential object containing a user in the DOMAINDMZ domain, the error goes away and the scriptblock executes as expected: 

Have you installed RStudio in a Linux VM? If so you can ssh into your instance using command and then use wget from inside your instance to download the file: 

At the Google Cloud Platform click on Products & Services which is the icon with the four bars at the top left hand corner. On the menu go to the Compute section and hover on Compute Engine and then click on Snapshots. At the menu above click on CREATE SNAPSHOT At the ‘Create a snapshot’ page fill in all the required information and choose the correct disk for your VM Instance. Click on create a snapshot and wait until the snapshot is created. 

The only option at present is to create snapshots/images of the VM Instance boot and the additional disks, however there is a feature request so that this feature can be made available in the future. There is no ETA but any updates can be checked on this link above. 

Can you run a dig command from your client machine to one of the machines the DNS server resolves for and share the results? Take into account that the Google Cloud DNS server that you have at the other end has to be registered with higher level DNS servers in order to be reached as explained in this page. If not, the world has no way of knowing you have a DNS server service on the Domain Controller. If you have already registered the DNS server, then you have to look at your client configurations as well, check your client machine name, domain name and name server you have set up. If it’s a Linux machine you should look at the configurations in /etc/resolv.conf and add the nameserver which depends a bit on which unix version you have. 

I have set up a lab with a number of Windows Server 2012 R2 machines. The lab has an Active Directory domain (DFL: Windows Server 2012 R2, FFL: Windows Server 2012 R2) and these machines are joined to the domain. By default if left unattended these Windows machines will automatically lock. I do not want the machines to lock automatically. I do not have any security concerns with having the machines remain unlocked as this is an isolated lab. I have created a group policy object that sets a number of configurations and the machines still lock. I have verified that the GPO has been applied to the machines. The GPO configures the following settings: 

On the suggestion of checking the Power Management settings by @joeqwerty I created a new Power Plan with the following settings: 

Copying the files in 12\TEMPLATE should do the trick, assuming the "templates" you are talking about are site definitions. You'll need to do an IIS reset on the server you copy to once the files have been copied. Usually site definitions are "site collection templates," so you would see them when adding a new site collection. If they are "site templates" you'll see them when adding a new site. There are no .STP files involved with site definitions. Best practice is to package and deploy a site definition as a solution as this simplifies the process. 

You may need to use the ADScpRegister utility from (included wtih RMS for Windows Server 2008, located in "C:\Program Files\RMS SP2 Administration Toolkit" ) to re-register the the URL: Here is a guide for installing RMS on Windows Server 2008, that discusses the ADScpRegister utility. 

wget might get disconnected during the download but you can use options described in above link that will help you make the download successful, like the -t and -c options for trying the download more times or continue getting a partially-downloaded file, respectively. After the file is downloaded you can use 7ZIP to unzip the file in the directory where it was downloaded to using the command: You can copy the file to a GCP bucket using the command: If wget and 7zip are not installed in the VM you can install them as per instructions, wget and 7zip, as follows. This examples are for Ubuntu or Debian Linux VMs: 

The first successful snapshot of a persistent disk is a full snapshot that contains all the data on the persistent disk. The second snapshot only contains any new data or modified data since the first snapshot. Data that hasn't changed since snapshot 1 isn't included. Instead, snapshot 2 contains references to snapshot 1 for any unchanged data. Snapshot 3 contains any new or changed data since snapshot 2 but won't contain any unchanged data from snapshot 1 or 2. Instead, snapshot 3 contains references to blocks in snapshot 1 and snapshot 2 for any unchanged data. 

The first snapshot that is created is a full backup of all your data in the VM boot disk. Any further backups contain any new data or modified data since the first successful snapshot. It would be very important that you follow the recommendations and instruction in the above documentation link to ensure that your snapshot is successful. It is also important to check and test that this backup is correct and check that you can recreate your systems from it should a disaster occur.
