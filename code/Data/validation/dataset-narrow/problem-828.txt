This error seems to be caused by . Check your central apache configuration and remove the directive for this directory and it should work. Source: $URL$ 

You can configure it in the console, under the default realm -> configuration -> user lockout. Here's the documentation (I'm assuming wls 12c): $URL$ 

I'm just starting to look into Azure and AKS. In order to do this, I have to enable a bunch of resource providers. I did this using the Azure CLI, like so: 

WebLogic uses certicom as the SSL provider by default. On version 10.3.3, they've added JSSE support. I haven't seen this specific error you're seeing, but maybe enabling JSSE will resolve it for you. You configure it at the server level, under Server > Configuration > SSL tab > Advanced tab 

You need to also remove the and directives from the virtual host's configuration, otherwise it'll be logged via the virtual host's log files. That said, how many virtual hosts are you running? You should be able to increase the fd limit to accommodate the number of virtual hosts you're running. Try apache's documentation example on this: 

Get a tcpdump, preferably filtering by their IP origin, and analyze it using a tool like Wireshark. You can see what's going on on the TCP level and better understand their issues, but if you have high load, analyzing it can be painful. Getting an end user experience monitoring solution. I realize telling you to spend money on a tool to solve an issue you have right now is not what you're looking for, but these are generally good value for the money in your kind of situation. 

When users want to log into one of our servers, the default domain is set to the machine name instead of the organization's domain, which is to say that the domain dropdown shows the machine name in the text part, while the organizational domain does appear in the dropdown (populated by the network, I assume). I have heard that one may set a default domain to appear instead of the machine name, and I need this to be that way. I expect it's a registry entry, but I have given up finding one which applies. Can someone please tell me how to do this? 

I have a server that is running all versions of .NET Framework, from 2.0 up to 4.0. An application I need to deploy won't run correctly on later versions, and was originally compiled for 1.1. Is it safe to install version 1.1 on the machine without causing any problems with the later versions? Edited to add: To the accepted answer I must comment on how it went after actually installing .NET 1.1. It went fine, except there was one problem that occurred. Sql Server 2005 Developer Edition was on the machine, and after 1.1 was installed, Sql Server Management Studio was no longer working correctly, and had to be removed and re-installed. Only a small problem, but noteworthy. 

Pick the website, right-click on it and choose Properties. Click the HTTP Headers tab and at the bottom of the panel is Mime Map. Click on the File Types button and use the resulting dialog to add file extensions and MIME types. Commenter is possibly correct, and ServerFault is possibly a better place for questions like this. But we coders have to worry about this kind of thing often enough, so I don't think it's too far off-topic. 

But, for some reason, one of those providers, specifically , is indefinitely in a state. I can check it via CLI, like so: 

LogFormat's %X should write to the log file when the connection has been aborted after processing was done. I haven't tested it but from the documentation (mod_log_config), this seems like what you're looking for. Keep in mind that this doesn't necessarily mean there's an issue on their side. I can think of two other ways of troubleshooting this that would give you even more information: 

I left it in this state overnight and it's still in the same state. I tried unregistering, which left it hanging in the state. Then tried to register again and it has been like that for about 10 minutes. The other 3 providers registered almost instantaneously. 

I know it's been a while, but this usually has to do with SELinux. Try setting it to permissive and it'll probably work fine. 

This probably has to do with the Managed Server's Listen Address. I haven't seen this error specifically, but if Listen Address is blank, WebLogic will bind to all IP addresses on the machine. When you enable DynamicServerList, these IP addresses would be sent to the Apache plugin. If there's an IP address that the Apache server can't connect to (e.g. a backup interface), you might have issues. This is not the error I would expect to see, but I have had issues with this before where everything in your scenario was exactly the same, except for the specific error message but I also wasn't using Apache 2.4. By the way, disabling DynamicServerList doesn't mean that Apache will keep sending requests to the downed server, thus making user experience very poor. Instead, whenever it detects that the server is down (e.g. via a series of Connection Refused errors), it will mark it as down and keep retrying from time to time. DynamicServerList is meant to avoid this and also to allow you to add Managed Servers to your Cluster without having to touch your plugin configuration. 

the bugzilla installation configuration begins, and goes until it stops again complaining about the 5.1 -> 5.0 downgrade. So I went and asked again on the irc and I was told to 

I have satelite broadband in my house (it's the only ISP I can get). A rough network diagram is below 

I'm not able to change the settings on my ISP's box. Within my house, 84.x.x.x is a page for mikrotik routeros (nothing I can change), 192.x.x.x is a password prompt, 10.0.0.1 is my router, and 10.0.0.5 is apache on my pc. Outside, 84.x.x.x is a blank white page and 192.x.x.x is server not found. My IP is not dynamic, I've had the same one for over a year now. Going onto speedtest shows several hundred results for 84.x.x.x, with varying speeds that definitely aren't my connection, some at the same time as I've been online. I know I've phrased this question horribly, but this really isn't my area, any help to put it better from anyone would be appreciated. What I want to know is, given that my ISP is probably proxying my connections, and my public-facing IP is probably shared, is it at all possible for me to run a internet accessible server of any kind (apache, irc, games, etc.)? (Another oddity that may be related: IRC servers, and bittorrent clients that usually get a IP address instead get a hostname which is just gateway.myisp.com ) 

Ubuntu would be my reccomendation. It mightn't have the most hardcore Linux features, and can be rightfully accused of pandering to Windows users, but when you're starting off, that's just what you need. It's also the only Linux distro to consistently "just work" with no hassle across all my pcs. 

Note that there is a file in wwwroot called "iisstart.htm". If I double-click on the file from Windows Explorer, the browser displays the rendered HTML correctly. If I try to navigate to the file using: 

Since I happen to have a CAL for a Windows 2003 server instance and plan to put together a home network using Win2k+3, I am wondering what books or other resources there might be out there giving advice, detailed or general, on how to do this. Also thinking as an alternative that I might be better off with Windows Home Server? Keep in mind that I am a developer, not a network admin. My primary goal here is to have a functioning small network so that I can, for instance, print documents from my laptop while using WiFi downstairs, have access to documents on a fileshare that I can work on while either upstairs or downstairs, and so on. I expect to have the server and two to three workstations on the network. 

I get the 503 then, too. What is going on? Is there some global setting I need to change? Note that this is a new Windows 7 workstation. I've checked and Classic ASP is definitely installed. The web site is associated with an application pool that has Classic ASP enabled, and 32-bit applications are also enabled. Event Log: 

I am being asked to resurrect a classic ASP application for temporary use. Wonderful. Well, the pay's the same, so I am now trying to get the thing to run on my localhost so I can test it and so on. I have copied all the files to c:\inetpub\wwwroot\ClassicASPapp. Using IIS 7.5 I set this folder as an Application I get handed a 503. Same result if I make it a Virtual Directory.
