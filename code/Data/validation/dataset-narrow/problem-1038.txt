I accidentally removed the Time displayed in Cinnamon's system tray on my Linux Mint, and am not sure how to add it back. It doesn't seem to be available among the options in the Applets window (that comes up on choosing "Add applets to the panel"), and there's nothing about the systray display in the "Date & Time" system settings either. How do I get this back on my display? 

In the dialog of gVim, there's a link at the lower left that says . When I click it, I'm simply taken to the Fonts folder in Control Panel. How can I use that to set a font for gVim, if I wish to choose a font that is not among the short list in the dialog itself? 

Check each plugin's existence by checking for any single command that it provides with , and set its options if it does exist. (This is just like in the accepted answer.) Put all the options set in the above manner within a function (called in my code). Call this function on the event, which is triggered while entering a new Vim session - but crucially, after the plugins have all been loaded. Because of this fact, our checks can check for the plugin functions without a problem. 

A tool answer: LinkShellExtension allows you to do this and much more. If you're working with soft/hard links in Windows at all, it's an enormously helpful tool. In this case, you probably want to choose its 'Splice' behaviour in copying Symlinks. 

When I give a command in Cygwin, I want it to invoke the gvim I've installed in my Windows. I tried writing a function in my .bashrc called that invokes the gvim.exe in my Program Files folder, using and all that, but the problem is, that apparently invokes the gvim with Cygwin's environment; prints C:\cygwin\home\Sundar instead of C:\Users\Sundar, and reports failures in creating temporary files which I assume are related to the same. So, how can I invoke gvim from Cygwin but make it as if it was invoked through, say, the Start menu? I tried changing the command to pass the gvim path to , but that too somehow sets up the same environment. What do I need to do to make this work? 

I found a roundabout way of getting Windows clipboard content into guest Linux, sharing it here in case anyone else finds it useful: 

If I open a file through a symlink first, then that one and later try to open the actual target of the symlink directly, Vim instead opens the symlink. How do I change this behaviour? The difference matters in my case for two reasons: (1) goes to the symlink's directory rather than the actual file's directory, and (2) vim-fugitive enables itself only within a git repo, and the target is in a repository while the symlink is not. Is there some kind of caching going on, and if so how do I disable it for cases like this? 

There seem to be more than a hundred packages all with the same kind of conflict, between package_name and package_name:i386. How should I resolve this? More details: I'm trying to install the 64 bit version of Ubuntu 13.04 from $URL$ onto my 64-bit Windows 7. I've given the guest OS "Version" as "Ubuntu (64 bit)" in VirtualBox. In the choose-predefined-collection stage I chose only "Basic Ubuntu server" and "Manual package selection" since I want only a basic commandline, no GUI. 

FTR, the above screenshots were taken with font set to 'Source Code Pro' in both editors, but I've tried all available fixed-width fonts (Courier New, Consolas, GNU FreeFont, Lucida Console, etc.) in gVim with no improvement in display. 

If NERDTree starts up somewhere in the C: drive, once I reach C:\ itself (which NERDTree considers as "/"), I get the message "already at top dir" if I try to click on the double dot NERDTree's help is all about navigating up and down directories, but there doesn't seem to be a way to directly specify a path to change to. Is there? Or is there any other way of switching drives on Windows? Edit: I found the roundabout way of: changing Vim's directory with , then . Is there a better, more direct way? 

(I had to take @madmax1's suggestion on keymapping too ( instead of ) because Scriptease has an autocmd overwriting the mapping, and I'm not sure how to override that from within .vimrc.) 

I've gotten used to in Firefox to undo the closing of a tab, is it possible to get similar functionality in Vim? Googling didn't point me towards anything useful for this. 

What could the issue be, and how can I make the compilation successful? I've tried changing the -I to -iquote (though gcc manual does say double quoted includes also eventually use -I), but that doesn't help. My first thought was it was a permission issue, but this is Cygwin and cpanm is running as me and I do have read access to EXTERN.h and exec access on the CORE directory. 

I'm trying to install Ubuntu Mini (obtained at $URL$ to a VirtualBox VM, and running into a weird problem: 

to my , but any time I use to open a new terminal window, the is run and hence new s are created which is undesirable and messes with the passthrough. I then tried moving the eval command to , but this too results in the same problem - I guess every new terminal window is considered a new login shell. A third option is to use , but I just found about it and am not clear on how to use it for this specific purpose, and perhaps more importantly, how to pass on the and information from where the service is created to every new shell created. Any suggestions on the best way to achieve this outcome - where a single ssh-agent is executed and waiting, and its information is immediately available to be used in any newly opened shell - is welcome. 

I'm able to input Tamil text successfully in gVim, but the output appears with letters getting one on top of another. This is the case whether I create the file from within gVim or create it elsewhere and open it in gVim. gVim seems to give insufficient space for individual graphemes, but more importantly, its idea of dealing with combining sequences seems to be "put them on top of each other" irrespective of where they are actually supposed to be. For eg.: ம + ெ should result in மெ as in the Notepad++ output (4th paragraph, 1st line, 5th word), but gVim seems to have dumped the ெ on top of ம and left it at that. Is there anything I can do on my end to change this and get a proper display? gVim: 

That looks like a lot of steps, but it all takes only a few minutes, and avoids the hassle of running a VM server and a Putty client and ing through for this simple feature. I haven't found a way to make it bidirectional though, suggestions welcome! 

I've set and in gVim for particular filetypes, to make Vim move by display lines rather than "actual" lines during navigation. However, I also frequently use the Ctrl-E shortcut to scroll through the buffer without changing cursor position, and I don't know how to make that scroll a display line only. Is there a way to achieve this? 

For the sake of anyone stumbling upon this later: I combined the two methods mentioned in @madmax1's answer and comment, to make Vim choose the appropriate method of help automatically depending on the filetype. 

I found an easier solution that tracking down all the environment variables required, though it has one limitation. The solution is to give at the Cygwin command line, where is an extension that is already associated with gVim under Windows. This opens gVim in a completely Windows context as far as I can see, $HOME is set to C:\Users\Sundar automatically, :diffsplit works with no error, etc. The one limitation should be obvious now - you need to have an existing file with a gVim-associated extension handily available, or this won't work. Update: While googling regarding this, I came across www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/2729 (down right now, text-only cache at $URL$ ), and found that opens gvim reliably, without having to rely on file associations. I'm now looking for a way to pass arguments to the gvim opened this way. 

I'm trying to install a module (Package::Stash::XS) via cpanm, but the installation is failing due to a gcc error. The command 

When I search for something using the Google search engine on Firefox's top right, it first checks www.google.com which then gets redirected to www.google.co.in. When I'm on a slow connection, this unnecessary redirect adds a few agonizing seconds to every search I perform. How can I change it so that Firefox uses a google.co.in URL by default? I get a option when I'm on other sites (e.g. right now I have ) in the list of search engines, but visiting google.co.in doesn't give me such an option. Is this a hard-coded exception in Firefox? How can I circumvent this?
