I ended up doing this by taking a VMware snapshot of the machine while frozen and then converting the .VMSN file to a .DMP file using the vmss2core tool. I had to use the option to get it to read my .VMSN file ( and didn't work). 

In addition to adding EscDomains registry keys per yagmoth555's answer, I had to set to (DWORD) for the registry settings to be applied. $URL$ describes the problem. I initially ignored it, because it's for Windows Server 2003 and we're running 2012 R2. It turns out that, while the hotfix doesn't need to be applied to later Windows Server versions, it still needs to be enabled using this registry key. 

I tried enabling boot logging, but there are no logs at all for the failed boot in . So either the problem occurs before the first log entry is written or it's actually failing to shut down. If I manually reboot the server, including by running from a command prompt this works. What else can I do to troubleshoot this? 

I have to power cycle the server to get it to work again. The System event log doesn't contain any errors. The last messages before shutdown are: 

However, this has no effect on the servers, which have IE Enhanced Security Configuration enabled. How do I configure them using Group Policy? Ideally, I'd want the same settings to apply both with and without ESC without listing them twice. 

I have a Windows batch script that copies an EXE or batchfile to a remote fileshare and runs it on the remote server using PowerShell WinRM. The line that runs the command remotely looks like this: 

Our Windows Server 2012 R2 VMware virtual machines have scheduled tasks defined to reboot them weekly using and some of these servers fail to restart some of the time. When I connect to the server via VMRC I see a screen like this: 

As you can see the first parameter ($1) is the device interface, for example it could be the wifi interface. It also resets interface ifb0 which is an alternative to tc filters for handling ingress traffic, by redirecting it to a virtual (ifb0) interface and treat is as egress traffic there. The idea is that you can shape egress traffic but not ingress traffic, thereby if you can make all traffic egress then you can shape it. This line creates a scheduler (qdisc) for the traffic on the interface supplied in paramter $1: 

Get rid of it. Thats is not an openvpn parameter. UPDATE Yes, I see you needed to add the client parameter as well. I am in the habit of setting up OpenVPN between networks with static keys and IP addresses. I never need the client parameter in those cases. 

The first word in the DNS entry clearly says its a DSL connection. That would be an example of an easy one. Another example: 

That is a traffic shaping (also known a throttling) script. It appears to take 3 arguments. The interface, the receive limits and the transmit limits. This first part just deletes everything: 

You could either have a firewall rule blocking access or Your /copos directory does not have full permissions. You should be able to figure it out by doing a: 

The only way one can guess at it is to check its reverse DNS entry. For example if the server detects a connection from 

I think you can see the point. If you are not familiar with military timezones here is the list: $URL$ You can also try to use zdump to see if your zone file is not really what you are expecting: 

The first thing I would do before proceeding further would be to test port 25 end to end with a tool like netcat. The tool comes standard with most linux distros. For example on CentOS I would stop postfix to release port 25. Then I would start netcat like this: 

If the sender of the auto-forwarded email is Alice while the recipient is Bob, then it IS from Alice's mailbox to Bob's mailbox. In this situation, use the MFCMAPI to check or clear the mailbox rules. Also, ensure the affected user's Outlook is not running, then send a test email to her, see if the message will be forwarded to Bob. If not, maybe the Outlook add-in causes the issue. Running Outlook in safe mode(Running Outlook.exe /safe), or manually disable add-ins to find the one causing this issue. If the sender of the auto-forwarded email is not Alice but the original sender, it would be another story. Search the message tracking log and pipeline trace would be helpful. 

1# General mobile devices use ActiveSync to connect to Exchange server. 2# No such bridge between different services. 3# Different protocols are for different services. For example, EWS service is mainly responsible for free/busy, OOF, mailtips and Outlook for Mac connection. ActiveSync is for mobile devices to access. RPC/HTTP and MAPI/HTTP are for Outlook connection. But it doesn't mean that only one protocol is needed for a specific client. For example, even when the Outlook connects to Exchange via RPC/HTTP, it will connect to EWS service when querying free/busy data. Actually, all of the protocols you mentioned above are based on HTTPS, they use the same port TCP 443 and same certificate(binding with IIS service on Exchange server). And we always use the same namespace for Outlook Anywhere, ActiveSync, EWS service, OAB virtual directory and MAPI/HTTP, such as mail.domain.com. For the internal clients, there would be no need to limit these services. For the external clients, make sure to publish the namespace autodiscover.domain.com, mail.domain.com, and the MX records. If you have firewall or proxy server, you may need to set the rule to publish these services. You can google the document related to the firewall/proxy setting you plan to use. Here is a blog about client access in Exchange 2013, for your reference: $URL$ Hope the above information helps.:) 

It appears you have a Centos 6 machine but have configured the Epel repository for Centos 7. That is not going to work. Remove it and install the Centos 6 Epel Repository at: 

The first thing to check is to see if the DNS request is actually leaving for the right destination. Open 2 terminal sessions. On one type: 

Your sendmail.mc looks ok. Apart from stopping and starting sendmail again (which I would guess you have already done). I would look at the actual configuration file which would be called sendmail.cf. Make sure you see the lines: 

Full info of components of Linux Traffic Control can be found here. UPDATE: by the way, in a regular linux box you can see the status of the traffic shaping queues by using tc -s. For example you could try to issue the following commands in your phone and they should work too: 

You should edit your expect script to allow for timeout and expected result after rsync. For example: 

Then anything you type on either end should be reflected/visible on the screen. If its not then your port is being blocked along the way. 

As you can see a tcpdump capture on port 69 will not show you the full dialog. Also if you have NAT, once the server attemps to send a file from a source port other than 69, most NAT implementations will fail to forward the packet (only a full cone or restricted cone NAT will work, but Port Restricted or Symmetric NAT will not). 

the important thing to note here is that it is lightning fast! That is because huge number of ip networks can be represented by a single hash instead of hundreds or thousands of lines of iptables rules. For blocking countries see this example: 

The above will exit the script in case of 60 second timeout or if received a denied response in case of bad password. Otherwise if it receives a "sent" text it continues. 

Move the file to another location, such as D:\, then try again. I ever encountered similar issues when loading file from root system drive C:\, moving it to another drive fixed the issue. 

Exchange back end site in IIS uses 81 for http and 444 for https. The default website use 80 and 443. If you install CAS role and Mailbox role on seperated servers, telnet 80 and 443 on CAS server while telnet 81 and 444 on mailbox server. If users are able to access OWA and ECP, it means there is no problem about network connection or binding issues. If OWA or ECP doesn't work, analysis IIS logs and application logs for clues. 

I resolved it myself. Not sure why, but i ran the command sc.exe config lanmanworkstation depend=bowser/mrxsmb10/mrxsmb20/nsi and sc.exe config mrxsmb10 start=disabled Reboot the server; then run sc.exe config lanmanworkstation depend=bowser/mrxsmb20/nsi After reboot the server again, now I can start the workstation service and other services now. my DC is back! 

Exchange 2010 does not support Windows Server 2016 Active Directory servers. Re-setup an Windows server 2012 R2 or previous Windows server, then check the result. Also, if it is a new organization, it's best to re-setup the domain environment, then install Exchange 2010 server. See: Exchange Server Supportability Matrix 

OWA and Mobile works, it means no problem with the address list or the contacts themselves. The issue would be the Address Book in Outlook related. By default, OAB will be updated on Exchange Mailbox server every 24 hours. You can try: 1.Remove the contacts from auto-complete list; 2.Change Outlook from cache mode to online mode; 3.Try to input the full email address. Then you would be able to send the email out successfully. 

As a most basic troubleshooting step, we need to confirm if the problem is mailbox account related or client related. Ask another user setup a profile(not in the existing profile) with this client, see if the issue would occur. Meanwhile, ask the affected user setup a profile on a normal user's client. Meanwhile, based on my experience, this issue would occur to the shared mailbox which is setup as the second mailbox in a profile. For example, User A has full access on User B's mailbox. When User A setup an Outlook profile and User B's mailbox is auto-mapped, the Calendar Permission will not gray out. If it's in this situation, setting up a separate profile would resolve this issue. 

if $TZ is unset and /etc/localtime is UTC then why are you using timezone T (Tango) in the date command? On my system I have a localtime of EDT. 

But to answer your question, I have seen this behavior many times (at both the ISP level or the individual router level). If I read you correctly, your existing sessions still work during the "incident" but new ones do not. This is caused by either your ISP placing a limit on the amount of sessions an end user can establish, or because the router simply choked on the high amount of sessions established. It could also be the ISP's modem/router having a limit on the amount of sessions per IP. That would explain why your 'computer 2' with another IP continues to work fine. ISPs place these session limits to prevent malware like bots/trojans/viruses spreading like wildfire and bringing a network to its knees. Just imagine a home user with a 50Mbps connection opening hundreds of thousands of sessions all over the place. Then multiply that by X users and you see how this cascades down into total chaos. I suggest you retest under a more controlled environment. Maybe just one PC and in safe mode to prevent any strange software from loading that is opening the sessions (maybe a bot/virus/trojan). Then put a permanent ping (no -c or -w). I would be pretty confident that you would not see the loss of connectivity every 15 minutes. UPDATE Here is a new test for you to narrow down the issue. Since you say the failure lasts 40 seconds, it should give you plenty of time to do the following. As soon as the failure is detected, change the wan IP of your router (from 192.168.0.10 to maybe 192.168.0.20). If the connectivity is restored, it will prove to you the ISPs modem is limiting sessions based on IP.
