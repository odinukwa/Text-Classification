You need to have the shell, or a program, emit the appropriate escape sequence to change the colours after you press enter. The bash shell used by current OS X doesn't have an obvious facility for doing this. 

I have not yet found a solution along the lines I was looking for. However there are online web-sites that report what level of SSL your client supports. One (there may be others, I am not endorsing this one) is howsmyssl.com whose reports are like this: 

The usual answer for this sort of requirement is to have a script generate a graph description that you feed to something like GraphViz or aisee For example 

Many routers support Port Address Translation (PAT) as part of port forwarding. This allows you to designate a high numbered external port that you connect to from the Internet, the router alters the port number to 80 (say) when it forwards the packets to your device. The router may not use the term PAT but it may provide for you to specify different internal and external port numbers. Note that FTP uses different ports for it's command and data connections. This can make it a difficult protocol to configure in a router (though most firewalls know all about passive and active forms of FTP). 

I only mentioned first out of habit and because I often forget that isn't quite as braindead as I used to think it once was. Caveat I'm pretty sure grep will have no problem with very large files. I'm less sure of findstr but I can't think of any reason not to try it. 

The Windows sound-recorder doesn't support play-through, you need a third-party application. As I say, I believe this depends on your Sound Mixer, whose capabilities seem to depend on your specific sound-card drivers. 

IrfanView is fast, and for photographers has the benefit that it can display EXIF data from JPEGs. It can also display RAW images - there is a plugin for Canon RAW. It has slideshow and thumbnail options but I find it useful to run it full screen and use the keyboard to move through the photos. Interesting article: Using IrfanView to View, Sort, and Tag Photos 

So far as I can tell, tools like inotifywait can watch an arbitrary list of files, they don't have to all be in one directory. 

The problem is the value of the TERM environment variable does not match the configured terminal characteristics - specifically the "Home and End keys" and "Function keys and keypad" settings. These can be hard to get right. What is expected by the Debian server. Type to see what your computer is expecting. 

It is unusual to run a mail service on a personal desktop or notebook computer. If you have a separate mail-server, whoever set that up will know it's name. 

Long long ago, modem meant voice-modems, which were used for data communications, including Internet access. These modems connected to a plain old telephone line (POTS) and used the voice bandwidth to transmit data. Later ones conformed to standards such as V.92 or were described as 56K modems. Early voice-modems were connected to computers by RS-232 serial cables. Later ones were typically on plug-in cards (e.g. PCI) and used the computer's CPU to do a lot of the work. Current ones are often USB attached. All these voice modems have an RJ11 socket for connection to a phone line. Several of these voice-modems were also Fax-modems in that they also supported the protocols used by fax machines. Software on the PC would be used to send or receive faxes. The word modem is nowadays probably more associated with ADSL-modems. However these don't do Fax. They don't use voice bandwidth (which is why you can still make voice-calls on a ADSL-enabled phone line) So yes, if you want to go down this route you probably need to buy a voice modem that can be detected by the device driver or associated software for your your all-in-one (or all-but-one-in-one) device. 

No. Assuming you mean in advance of, or instead of, downloading everything onto your own computer and counting it there. There is no general well-established convention or method by which administrators of websites make this information available. You can work this out for some sites (see other answers) but the way you do this, and the probable success, vary from site to site. 

In the past I have used the Squid Proxy for this. It can operate in transparent mode if need be, but that is more work. Easiest is the configure the clients to use the proxy and configure the router/firewall to block HTTP access from any IP_address but that of the Proxy. 

Windows XP and earlier On Windows XP and before, Notepad could not display characters which were not in the selected Font. Therefore a missing or incorrectly displayed character (typically shown as an empty box) could be caused by: Using Arial instead of Arial Unicode. Arial is 778,552 bytes, Arial Unicode is 23,275,812 bytes. The difference is that a huge number of characters are in Arial Unicode but not in Arial. (these sizes are from Vista not XP but the difference will be similar). Omitting the Byte Order Mark(BOM) Windows expects Unicode files (UTF-8, UTF-16 LE, etc) to contain a BOM. If not, Windows then guesses the encoding using a Windows API function () which is well-known to make mistakes, resulting in multiple Latin-1 characters being shown instead of a single correct character. 

In general, when a new communications technology is invented, the inventors make it as fast as possible. They don't know any feasible way to economically make it faster. They set a speed at which the technology should operate so that users can be sure that equipment from different manufacturers will interoperate. Take Ethernet as an example, after playing around with lower speeds, the group that defined the standard settled on 10 Mbps over thick coaxial cable. If they'd known then how to get 10 Gbps over twisted pair cable at a marketable price, I'm sure they would have done it. If you've worked out how to get 10Mbps over thick coaxial cable, you probably don't know how you could get 10 Gbps over the same cable and it would be pointless specifying how all the nodes should negotiate speed if you don't yet know how future high speed devices might interoperate with low speed devices. A kind of exception exists for low-speed low cost systems such as USB. It was known the keyboards need lower IO rates than memory devices so they built in a way to negotiate between low and high speeds. Yet even higher speeds had to be retrofitted - they were not anticipated in the original standards. It is better to issue a usable standard now than wait until you can work out what speeds might be possible in twenty or thirty years time. 

Bad things will probably happen if you change controller mode from IDE to RAID. Unless you first back up your data, then reconfigure BIOS, connect up appropriate drives to appropriate connectors, configure RAID, reinstall OS and restore data. The spec and manualsays 

But I've no idea whether that is nonsense. It certainly looks like nonsense. Some time spent playing about in a similar fashion may lead to a solution. 

It seems to me that using --fetchall and --keep means you can't resume an interrupted fetch without re-fetching all previously fetch mail. 

Perhaps you could move the data into database tables, perhaps using Microsoft Access, perhaps using something better. You could then use those database tables as data-sources for the Excel worksheets. 

Yes. See below. I assume by "ping" you really mean "contact using a web-browser" in order to receive an HTTP response code 418.
