and then try the previous command again. Also, change public to 'no' and restart Samba. When you connect from your Windows machine, you'll be prompted for pi's username and password. Setting it up this way means Samba knows you're not an anonymous user, so it gives you the access rights of user pi. 

Most aquarium pumps are AC. You'd need a DC pump if you're going to power it from batteries. It's probably easier to use an AC pump with something like this: $URL$ With a device like this, you can use any mains powered pump, and you don't need to use a relay. 

These two solutions are for different types of cluster. The one developed at Southampton University is kind of a super computer - it's good for number crunching, but not designed for use as a server cluster. If you want to host a web site on multiple Pi servers, you need to use a load balancer. Note that some jobs can be shared across multiple servers, and some can't. If you have a cloud storage system with several Pis, it will be difficult to keep them synchronized. The cluster with the load balancer just serves pages, and it isn't built for cloud storage. You could use several Pis to serve a web site, and use another Pi for cloud storage. 

How do I check the framerate of my .h264 video? I used VLC player (tools) but it doesn't list the codec information as well as framerate. I explicitly set the framerate to be 60. 

I checked lot of answers which told to update the package and I did that but nothing seems to help. IS my camera gone or is there some solution? 

I remote login into my Pi using TightVNC Viewer. Now I can see Pi GUI. But when I do I can't see the display of the picamera on my TightVNC Viewer's window? What I want is that while I am recording from my picamera I should be able to see the stream of camera at a remote desktop viewer's(like VNC) screen. One way of doing that is using a webserver but that seems overkill. Is there a any other way? I read that Camera is laid onto HDMI monitor as a separate entity not a part of Desktop. Can I make the camera to stream to TightVNC viewer's window? 

You need to add a line to /etc/fstab. Linux uses this file to see what drives to mount when it boots. Try adding something like this at the end of /etc/fstab: 

A Pi isn't a powerful web server, but many personal sites don't get that much traffic. A Pi can be viable as a home server I haven't tried serving video from a Pi server, but I suspect that would be quite slow, and you wouldn't be able to stream video to many people simultaneously. You might be better off uploading images to imgur, upload your videos to Youtube, and embed them in pages on your site. This will massively increase the amount of traffic your server can handle. If your site is made from static HTML pages you might be able to serve around 100 pages per second (based on these tests). If your site is built using a large CMS like Wordpress, your Pi will struggle to serve one page in around 6 seconds. If you use Wordpress, you can improve page load time using caching plugins, but it will still be much slower than using static HTML pages. You could use a CMS that generates static HTML files like Pyplate. Or you could use a Javascript solution like Ghost. 

I have been working with Raspberry Pi + PiNoir Camera for 5 months now. Everything was working fine till I tried to attach my pi-camera to my room's ceiling. To stick the camera to the ceiling I used a tape on the back side of camera's Flex Cable. Also I placed the camera on an aluminium surface. Now I get this error when I use my cam 

By Capture_sequence method of Picamera, I can capture consecutive images. I want the exact timestamp of each of the image that I capture. I can embedded in the name of each file that is being captured but there will a small lag. Is there any way by which I can capture the time at which image is taken in a more accurate manner ? Video frames have property, does any such property exists for single images? My capture code : 

Picamera records by default at 1920*1080 resolution (Full HD) and it is very clear. But all the videos are compressed using h264 (MPEG-4) codec. Can I get the uncompressed video recording since the experiment that I'm doing might not work if the video recording is compressed. Is there a way to capture the Raw video without any compression? 

If you are using gcc, try using the -O0 option to disable optimisation. It's possible that the compiler decides that the tim variable isn't really needed when it's declared locally, so it produces executable code that skips the loops. When tim is declared globaly, the compiler uses different optimization rules, so the loop is included in the executable file. 

You also need to check the permissions of the directory /var/www/test to see if that is accessible for everyone: 

The default clock speed was 480MHz, but in recent releases it's been reduced to 432MHz to address some stability issues. See this page for more info: $URL$ 

WiringPi has a command line utility called 'gpio'. This makes it possible to control GPIO pins from the command line. Read about it here: $URL$ WiringPi doesn't need to be run as root, but programs built with the RPi.GPIO module do need to be run as root. 

So it turns out that Camera port of my Raspberry Pi had some problem. Replaced the Pi, camera is working smoothly. 

I read on raspberryforum that above error means that my camera is dead. If yes why did it happen? Can I do anything to rectify this error. What important cautions should we take while using camera? 

I want to stream the video that is being recorded by Pi-camera to my Remote computer for monitoring. There are lot of tutorials Online which deal with this topic. I was able to make one way work, that is using Netcat + Mplayer. But there are few issues. 1. There is too much delay in display. How can I decrease latency? 2. Currently only streaming using is working. But I want to record simultaneously too. How do I record and stream at the same time? 3. Through VNC I can remotely login into pi. But can't stream the video being record. Is there any way to stream video over VNC? My pi model is Raspberry pi 2 and camera is Pi Noir.
