That's a BIOS Code for Bad Memory. Remove single sticks to narrow it down or swap them all out if nothing works. 

After doing a Ctrl + Alt + Del - you will find the Power Options in the bottom right corner (under Windows 7). From there you can hybernate 

They are backward compatible. But - since each version brings new functionalities with it, only the basic function set is backward compatible all the way, see the table for more detail. In addition to that 2 devices wanting to communicate using bluetooth have to support the same profile(s), the full piece that i copy/pasted from here. 

In that case go to the Snapshot manager and create a clone of your defined snapshot. The VM has to be turned off - the clone will then be your base vhd including your snapshot file (which only documents changes to base vhd). 

If nothing in the boot process changes: Motherboard...?! At this point the question you have to ask yourself is wether or not it actually makes sense to spend hours (eventually days) tracking down the problem, or wether it's better to build/buy a new system...obviously depends on wether this is purely private and fun/hobby or if you really need to get some work done and don't need this. Replacing a not so new Aspire L320 shouldn't cost a lot (especially in comparison to the hours spent trying to fix it). By the way: Continue posting your results as you try solving this, someone might have had the exact component/problem and can add to the issue. 

You cannot remove the button - but you can keep Windows from prompting you if applications are still open when the WaitToKillAppTimeOut is reached.Do this by opening regedit - go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Control Panel/Desktop/ and if not already present create a new entry called AutoEndTasks of Type REG_SZ with the value set to 1. 

The Problem lies in the fact that the WOL Function relies on an Ethernet Broadcast which solely goes by a MAC-Address (OSI Layer 2), not an IP (Layer 3). Trying to do this through a VPN-Connection will usually go wrong, with the following settings you can get around this: Setup Port-Forwarding in your Router with UDP Port 9 (WOL Layer 3 Pakets usually go by this port) on your local machine - don't forget to set static IP's since DHCP will jumble things up (eventually) also be careful, if you do have a dhcp range you want to keep alive, set static IP's outside this range. 

This is a quick and dirty hack which will break in interesting and possibly dangerous ways if the file names in the first column are not a single token. We basically refactor your text file into a sequence of scripts. So your example will be turned into 

We collect into the array the line numbers of the matches. We then figure out how many of the line numbers in the array are smaller than the middlemost line; their count is assigned to the first partition. (We have to use because we are already past the partitioning point when we out of the loop.) In general, you want to avoid rereading the same file many times, especially if it might be big; and secondly, try to minimize the number of processes. It's not clear what you expect the middle output field to contain. If the file contains an odd number of lines, the first "half" will contain one line less than the second partition. (This is not hard to change, but you have to decide one way or the other.) 

This will replace any existing crontab. A somewhat less risky approach is to check for an existing crontab, and add the desired stanza at the end if it is missing; but you can't really avoid a race condition. The sanest solution is probably to have a modular designed around or something similar; but this is unfortunately not a standard feature. 

Since the template is embedded in the program itself, there is no need for it to exist in any other file. To extract it on a system where you don't have a crontab, try temporarily setting your editor to . 

With some hesitation, I would consider the header standardized in RFC3834 which allows you to suppress bounce messages for automatically generated email. As such, it's not really intended to be used on forwarded messages, but it's worth a shot. You would add that to the forwarded message something like this: 

You'll need to split the file into partitions by destination file, and perform on each file individually. Assuming you have the file names and line numbers grouped by file name and in ascending order, you can do something like 

Cron doesn't have access to your X session, by design. You should probably run this in a background loop from your or similar instead. 

The obvious reason: An ID is just too complex for every day use, using handles like names is much easier. Slight Elaboration: Your Wireless Access Point will have a BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier) ...usually the MAC-Address of the Device(which is unique) and a SSID Service Set Identifier which is a 32 Byte long Name you can give your Network to which it will respond if called on.Besides being nicer than memorizing some "seemingly" random ID's/Mac Addresses it also allows you to split the Network into multiple virtual LANs or extend a Network over multiple WAPs by utilizing identical SSID's. Abstracting Wireless Networks in this way makes their use so flexible. 

Chrome and Firefox are relatively easy about this, a matter of copying folders...IE handles things slightly different it seems, more Info behind the links: • Chrome • Firefox • Internet Explorer 

Check that the CPU fan is spinning on startup Check if there is any/enough thermal paste between heat sink and CPU Remove the RAM Sticks and try booting with single sticks to see if it's a faulty stick Swap the PSU out for another... If all else fails, swapping the graphics card for another would be worth a try 

802.11g Bandwidth (net): 19MBit/s & Radius: ca. 38m 802.11n Bandwidth (net): 240MBit/s & Radius: ca. 70m So, doing anything in parallel like streaming data (device to device, not internet related)to other devices in your lan will see its limits very fast using 802.11g. Add to that the fact that 802.11n will give you a larger operating radius (think of all those corners of your home you want to get wifi in). Short answer: Yes, strong benefit. 

The packetloss at your router will probably be an overloaded router dropping packets where normally an error packet would be generated. Try increasing the interval...see if there are changes. Beyond that the packet loss figures don't really mean anything to your connection with the destination ip. 

The command top will generally show you the information given in the Activity Monitor ordered by the processes using the most resources (like CPU-Time). For more information on the top and ps commands prepend "man" eg; man top. 

You're looking for Section Break. It will not allow you to insert some design or theme. For that i would write a little VB Macro to take care of this - see description here. The example given could be applied to every section break in a document. 

In the general case, there is no "installation" with -- just like a file, the archive can contain just about anything, including but not limited to backups of your photos, a collection of email messages, drawings for a CAD system, etc etc. What you have downloaded is a source tarball. The files in the archive are what a programmer would use to build a binary for their architecture. This particular project looks very much like it was designed for Unix-compatible systems, and will not trivially build on Windows. Projects which are portable to Windows will often contain something like a (perhaps in a subdirectory) with basically a compilation recipe for the utility, or a file for Visual Studio. The generic Unix instructions for building from a tarball are basically 

Instead of messing with your you could simply move it to (assuming this directory exists and is already on the default , and assuming the script is self-contained, i.e. doesn't also need to have libraries or data files installed). The prefix is used to refer to the current directory; you should omit that part to make the shell use your for locating the script or executable. 

If you can remove the hard drive and mount it from a different computer, that's an easy way to do it. With modern compact laptops, accessing the internal hard drive is not always easy, but if you are lucky, there is a standard 2.5" drive behind two X screws that you can access from the side of the case, or sometimes the bottom. It's been a few years since I last did this, but I recall creating a small partition for the installer, and then just copying it over with . This would have been back in the day of floppy-based Debian installs, but things may not have changed all that much. These days, I would create a bootable USB image and copy that over, mark the partition as bootable in , and go. If you can get a hold of a USB cradle for your drive, that makes things a lot easier. 

Common spell checking utilities include and . Other things being equal, I would recommend the latter; but there are legacy reasons to prefer , and if it's installed on your system already, and is not, it should be fine for English. Maybe also look at which, despite its name, is not just for Hungarian. For the vast majority of the languages of the world which use a (vaguely) alphabetic orthography (and possibly the majority overall), it is vastly better than tools which are based on the limited morphological system of English. 

This can happen due to a number of reasons, so go by trial and error for the following cases: • Is the File to be executed empty? Check the Filesize... • Are you trying to run a 64-Bit app on a 32-Bit Version of your OS? and lastly... • Is JDK 7 installed and is your path set? Run Ctrl + R and type cmd hit Enter and type path and Enter again. If your Java Bin Directory is not in this string then that is your Problem. 

Windows, by default, will do incremental Backups with the exception that if you let Windows choose how to go about it, it will (if the needed storage space is available) include a system image. To avoid this behaviour:► Choose Setup Backup and select your destination drive - Next► Select Let Me Choose and Uncheck "Include a System Image"It can be argued about how exactly backups should be done "the right way".To add a little subjectivety: Storage is cheap so in my case i create a System Image roughly every Quarter with weekly Incrementals for specific Directories. 

Your Motherboard is not being powered properly. Check your connection PSU <-> Motherboard. Check again, and again and again... 

Take 8.8.8.8 as your secondary DNS Server. Adding multiple servers won't really give you more security in my opinion, google ALWAYS works (and has worked). 

This can be due to a number of things, narrow the possibilities down by removing (where possible) the component and checking it for obvious faults. This is how i would do it: 

TP-LINK TL-R470T+ is an inexpensive option with 3 additionally configurable ports (wan/lan) although i don't have any experience in the setup of this kind of thing TP-LINK has always been a stable and quiet cheap solution. Edit: Since your main concern is stability, i would refrain from trying to build little DIY-Solutions. The configuration is generally much broader/deeper than using a router with this kind of functionality. In addition to that, you don't really want to be troubleshooting 10 components when the system breaks... 

As far as i know Core 2 Duo CPU's do not have on-die GPU's, so disabling the only GPU your system has available to it will mean: No Video...A CPU is not designed generate the video output to your screen. By deactivating the GPU in Device Manager you're only deactivating the Driver, hence you still get Video Output at the (without a driver) possible resolution of 1024x768. 

The command formats its output based on the current time and the format string produces the minutes field of the current time. 

For this simple script, using double quotes instead of single will populate the variables from the parent shell. Of course, if your script contains strings or other expressions which should not be interpolated by the parent shell on the host where you start this script, those need to be escaped or otherwise neutralized. But you don't seem to have any of those here. 

I'm vaguely speculating that the encoding might be related to ISO-2022, but I am not familiar enough with it to really be sure. It has obviously gone through at least one broken filter, possibly multiple, before ending up like this. Looking at the first line, is ѓ and was probably a single 8-bit byte before the conversion. A general pattern seems to be followed by a signal byte, where the FF is some hex sequence in plain ASCII (mostly 83 here, but generally from 80 through 9E in the entire sample), and the final byte is now an UTF-8 character. (It could have been multiple bytes in the input as well, of course.) This sequence appears between words (always ?), and sometimes within words. Here is the same fragment as just text, as it renders under UTF-8 now. 

Maybe also look into using a here document (so you can use both single and double quotes in the embedded script) and perhaps understanding when to quote things. This will work fine as long as your variables don't contain irregular whitespace or wildcard characters, but it's uncanny. 

Without access to the malicious attachment, there really is no way to tell; but yes, I would be slightly worried. There is rarely a legitimate reason to send a forged email with an attachment. Another question entirely is whether your system was vulnerable to whatever exploit they were trying to pull off -- the world is still full of Windows XP boxes, and many of the prevalent campaigns still try to focus on this extremely low-hanging, rotting fruit. If you are one of them, I would certainly advice you to unplug immediately and start to plan mitigation. A good first step would be to not plug your computer back in to the network until you have a better picture of what happened. Copy interesting stuff to a USB stick and proceed with caution from a different computer (use an internet café or whatever -- don't surf from your zombie box).
