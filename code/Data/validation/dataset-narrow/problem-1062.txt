Note To start the computer from the Windows Vista or Windows 7 DVD, the computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For more information about how to configure the computer to start from the DVD drive, see the documentation that is included with the computer or contact the computer manufacturer. 

I have tried disabling a bunch of stuff in msconfig and its pretty light, but I don't understand this pause that happens. Any ideas? Update: Hardware i7 5820k Reference Zotac GTX 980Ti with a modded bios(EVGA SC) 16GB 2400 DDR4 RAM Samsung 850 512Gb SSD, 3 TB Red, 1 TB Green Don't think its the modded BIOS because i did that before and it was running fine after it was flashed and overclocked. 

The problem was confirmed to be with the motherboard, an RMA has been initiated. DIMM slots are causing problems. Don't know what caused it, my computer hasn't moved in a year, could be voltage fluctuation. 

Where is the actual system device (the external drive) and /Volumes/BackupDrive is the name under which you can access it. The latter one can be anything, the /dev has to be correct though. The actual device might be something else then disk1s1, depending on the external drive, and you might have to create the directory BackupDrive, or use something else that's available in /Volumes. So: 

This is the only course of action, everyone complains about glitchy graphics, unfortunately there is nothing to be done for the support is minimal from AMD's side. 

Put the Windows Vista or Windows 7 installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer. Press a key when you are prompted. Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click Next. Click Repair your computer. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt. Type Bootrec.exe, and then press ENTER. 

SLI doesn't add more memory to the existing set up. All it does is add to the computing power using the SLI bridge. Therefore nothing is wrong when it tells you that 1GB is still on your system. The reason for this is because the SLI link cannot transfer data fast enough over the bridge and must therefore abandon one of the card's memory banks. Either way as you have just gone SLI, you should update your drivers all the time and pay close attention to when new games come out. I shall quote some FAQ from a frequented thread at overclock.net, to answer your main concerns. The thread is located here 

There's a wonderful notion in the tar realm called a tar-ball. Basically it behaves very much the same way a real tarball would. It's sticky and you can throw stuff at it and it will stick! So the basic Tar usage is: 

So as you can see the tarball just gets bigger and bigger! Since you can imagine this to be a rather big ball lying around after some time, perhaps you want to retrieve something from it after a while? Or maybe even delete it? To extract a file out of the tar ball we have 

to get a list of devices, your external drive should be there. I think it should be something like disk1s1, or something that looks like it. 

Go into skype's preferences and then audio settings, and make sure that your USB griffin microphone is selected as the mic 

That is a very odd problem indeed. The fact that the hard drive didn't work on another computer strikes out the possibility that it is your usb3 drivers. If you can, obtain another cable that is used with usb3 device and see if that works. Sometime the cable could be defective. As confirmed by the WD support center, you resolved the problem by replacing the cable on your USB 3 device, since it was indeed faulty. 

Was a startup item called "Delayed Launcher" run by Intel rapid storage technology. After i disabled that, my boot up times went back to normal. Thanks everyone for your time. 

i have been getting very frustrated lately since the functionality has been removed from MacOSX and Tab Auto-Completion doesn't work anymore. So i was wondering if anyone knew a good alternative to use that i could install so i can tab auto-complete files when sftp'd in. I heard that with-readline is a good option for this. If so, how do i get an to work? I would like to do the same with any other option that isn't with-readline, so i don't have to assign an alias each time i set up a session. I am using Mac OS X 10.8(Mountain Lion) with Homebrew installed. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me. 

So i've been facing this issue for a few weeks.I just came out of an issue with my GPU where it was too clogged with dust, causing the temperature to hit around 100 where it would crash the computer, i realized the issue and now my temps are at 60ish and everything was fine for a while. That may not be connected to this but i thought i'd share anyway. Age of Machine - Built Mid 2011 

So basically you need to recover your bootrec using a Windows disc. The entire documentation is listed here. To run the Bootrec.exe tool, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps: 

Currently what is happening is somewhat perplexing. Randomly while using my computer the monitor screen will go off, little to no sound looping will occur and the keyboard locks up(caps lock doesn't trigger the capslock light). That's all. No lights on my keyboard, no fan speeds going crazy nothing. The computer is on and its like nothing has happened, of course the computer monitor "has no signal" and it basically switches off. I have been monitoring temperatures of CPUs and GPUs while playing games or anything and they seem to be absolutely fine. I have conducted a few memtest passes and nothing seems to be the issue with my RAM. I have also updated everything i can think of. I can't for the life of me wrap my head around this. If there's any advice you guys can lend, i would greatly appreciate it. 

I can tell you out of experience that yes this works. The way Raid works is that the meta-data is stored on the disk itself, this allows for the disks to be set up every single time the computer is powered on, and why the controller must boot itself, check the drives, and then set up the array. This is also how information is stored on parity disks and can be retrieved when(in set ups such as RAID 5) one of the hard disks dies. In fact, if you were to take those drives and set them up in a different server/motherboard with the same controller, your information would be intact. It all depends on the controller, because of the way in which the information is stored and the way in which the company approaches data-correction and data-recovery at a bit-level. Parity files are wondrous things. I hope this has answered your question.
