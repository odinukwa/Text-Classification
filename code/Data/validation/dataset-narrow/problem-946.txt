In Windows 10 I just ran into following problem: When using shift+right-click to start the powershell within some folder, I always get an error if the folder name contains two consecutive spaces. If you navigate to 

I want to backup some files that I regularly work on on a separate medium. It is however not very convenient if I have to plug in usb drives or external harddisks all the time as I have to carry my laptop around a lot. Now I had the idea to use an SD card that I can just leave it plugged in my laptop. (The idea of this backup is just having the files saved on another medium than the harddrive.) Now I have following questions: 

In firefox you can enter your search terms in the URL bar, and it will start a search in the engine you defined. If you choose in the preferences, it will use . This has the backdraw that you cannot restrict the search to your own country. 

When using windows 7 in a language other than english (german in my case) the paths (mainly of the system folders, like for instance) in the windows-explorer are sometimes translated: 

I don't think that the outage killed the modem, but I would make sure to check with cox that the new modem you bought will actually work on their network, they can be pretty picky. I know for a fact that the the "WRT54G" will work though. Also did you try the old unplug, with 3 seconds, replug, trick? That works most of the time. Also it might be your wireless router that's having the problem seeing as only one computer is connecting (I'm guessing it's the desktop). 

Well, that's probably because you can only transfer so much data over one connection. However in a multi-threaded program you can have two connections receiving data at the same time and doubling the amount of information you can obtain. There are some limitations to this for example the speed of the server you are downloading from... Hats off two whoever wrote the multi-threaded downloader, those are not easy to write. 

Too Fast? I didn't even know that a too fast existed, you should be fine, I wouldn't be too worried about the SSD screwing anything up. 

There is also Belvedere which is from one of my favorite tech and productivity sites lifehacker Its definitely worth a look. Also if your not to afraid of learning a little auto hot key scripting you could write one yourself without too much trouble. 

First of all, most godaddy accounts are shared. It means you don't have access to either root or firewall. In this case you cannot do it there - either using PHP or in any other way. If you do have root and made sure the firewall allows input connections to the port you want then you can use a tcp wrapper like to let any script you like to listen on certain port. Please note it is generally a bad idea because such wrappers may not handle simultaneous connections properly. If you still want it, make sure the port you want to use is not occupied by another process (like 80 and 443 by webserver). The places where you able to direct the php script output to are e.g. file or database. Yuo cannot send the data directly to a browser because in chain sender-xinted-php there's no browser. You'll need e.g. another php script which will be run behind webserver to get data from either file or DB and send it to browser. 

On-Demand instance is on (and you are billed for those hours) from the moment of start until it is stopped or terminated. It is not in 'sleep' mode even if there's no workload. It is really just billing term. Regular external IP will be changed if you restart the instance (but not if you reboot it). If you need to keep static public IP then use elastic IP: one such IP per instance is free of charge as long as the instance is running. Why use on-demand? You don't have to pay upfront anything. If after a week from your start you found t2.micro is too c,mall (or too large) you can scale the instance anytime and you'll be billed according to the new instance size. Pls note you're always billed for full hour even if you used two minutes from it. For burst webservers: t2 type was made for this purpose but don't forget to watch CPU Credit Balance at monitoring otherwise your performance may be unexpectedly low. 

If you use the scroll wheel in Adobe Acrobat in one direction, but then turn it in the other direction the first "click" of the scroll wheel always gets ignored. This is annoying when browsing through large documents in the single page mode. (one click = one page) (This behaviour is not present in other programs, so I assume it is an Acrobat specific problem.) Is there a way to change this such that every "click" of the scroll wheel results in scrolling? 

Is there a way to disable this translation and always show the actual names of the folders? These translations are annoying when you have to set up programs manually or generally when programming. 

I think I have read somewhere that you can tweak some settings in , but I was unable to find those. EDIT: The person asking here seemed to have the same problem. Aparently was removed a while back. But that only is available must have changed more recently, as I do use the country restriction very frequently. 

within the explorer and then use said method to open the PS you get an error and PS starts up in the folder . Is there a way to fix this? I know that usually it doesn't make sense to have two consecutive spaces in a folder name (some might argue that even one space is one too many), but that is not the question here. EDIT: This is the rough translation (indicated by ) of the error I get (it is printed in my system language). I don't think it helps as you could easily try yourself: 

That should return much more quickly also the -W parameter is in milliseconds, so that should send 1 packet and only wait 250ms for a response. EDIT You Sure?: 

So, I have been going through and riping all of my DVD's and it seems that the way to get the highest quality out of these is to have DVD Shrink de-encrypt, rip, and decompress, the DVD's. After that I usually end up with a high quality (high size) set of .vob files in a classic DVD structure. Then I use a python script that I wrote to automate the process of finding the title sequence and then combining all of the title sequences' .vob files together into one file(similar to the "copy /b" command in windows), and then changing the extension to .mpg (a more widely supported format then .vob). This allows me to get a high quality rip in about 40 min. The problem comes in playing the files. I need all of the ripped dvd's to play on my media computer using windows media center but windows media center (and vlc for that matter) all think that the video files are anywhere from 5 min. to 0 min. which is not a problem (the video will still play all the way through) but if you want to pause it, when it is unpaused the video will start all the way over (Also fast forward and rewind don't work). I suspect that it is something wrong with the way the timeline is encoded in the video file, various forums on the internet recommended using virtualdub to fix the errors. But when I try to open the file virtual dub says that the file is not in mpeg-1 encoding and may be in mpeg-2. Is there any way to fix this? PS: I am aware that there was a similar question but it hasn't had any activity for 2 months and is dealing more with wmv files. 

I've met this error when I need to install 5.7 after MariaDB. and didn't help. WARNING: this command will DESTROY your data! Do not run it if you need the data. I did not need it (a fresh server) so I just , it helped immediately. 

No way unless you set up additional service on the server. Regardless of firewall, the main issue is HTTP closes connection each time after the request is fulfilled whilst SSH requires constantly open connection. 

Even if you have no physical access to the server - someone has. There are many ways but all of them assume you're booting from another partition. For example depending on your hosting provider: 

The question is not correct, RSS does not support anything underlying like HTTP, TCP, IP etc. Nevertheless RSS feed as kind of data can be served either with HTTP or with HTTPS (or both) depending on the server settings. Auto-addition: if you're use relative links in the header of a page then protocol of that page will be used. If you use absolute links then, well, you name the protocol. 

Besides destination - permission does matter, because you're logging in to the instance with scp/rsync as ec2-user, not root. Nevertheless, e.g. is readable to anyone, this is why it was transferred. Make sure owner is not 'root'. Try: 

Pretty well from what I've seen, slightly slower with the real-time protection but still fast. You can see a bunch of AV comparisons on this site: AV Comparatives EDIT: Also just from looking at the tests I linked to it looks like KIS has no particular benifit over MSE, McAffe, or AVG. Personally I user avast! and really like it, lots of options and is pretty good performance wise. 

It appears that you haven't installed ubuntu to your flash drive correctly... I recommend following the steps on Ubuntu's Website, as well as using a program like Unetbootin or my favorite UltraISO (google them)... Now as far as some of the other things: Ubuntu will never work like windows, it doesn't try to work like windows, and as far as the constant need for installing new packages goes, that will always be there as well. It's part of the idea, ubuntu is a fairly stripped down OS, It doesn't come with most of the parts one would expect from an operating system like windows, that said all of these things can be installed from various sources. As far as traditional locations, like C:, they don't exist in ubuntu, the root or "/" is basically a rough concept of the same thing. As far as documents folders and such they can be found in your home directory "~" or you can click "Places" --> "Home" to find that. Also one last note, quite a bit of great free software can be found in the ubuntu "universe" which can be found by going to "Applications" --> "Get new software"
