When the value is missing, that means the default setting is being used (i.e. Ctrl + Shift). References 

List all files in the current folder. Get each file name and tokenize it. Ensure the retrieved characters are actually numbers: The variable is echoed and then piped to the command, which will use a regular expression to match alphabetical characters. 

Right-click the empty area in the right pane and select New > Expandable String Value from the context menu. Name the new value . Double-click it and change it's data to . Log off and log back on to apply the changes. 

svchost.exe The executable file is described as Host process for Windows Services. It's a generic process that hosts different system services. 

The change was aimed for the better, but it got mixed reactions because not everybody experienced a real improvement. Granted, the hardware and software combinations definitely play a major role here, so your mileage may vary. Reverting back If you don't like the changes, you can try disabling DirectWrite as a workaround: 

Download and run SharpKeys. Click Add, select Function: F13 (00_64) from the list, and map it to Special: PrtSc (E0_37), then click OK. Click Write to Registry, then log off or restart Windows to apply the changes. 

The LZNT1 algorithm is designed for speed, and there's no way to set a custom compression level. 1 Folders aren't actually compressed: their compression attribute only gives a default compression state to new files and subfolders. Additional information 

Type or to display basic command line usage. For further information, check the GNU Wget Manual. There's a Firefox add-on called cliget which can help you get the correct command. Note Make sure to enclose the URL inside straight quotes (), because are reserved characters of the Windows command line interpreter. 

Note This will also prevent you from changing those values, unless you manually edit them by running as administrator. Keep in mind the program might not work correctly if it can't write to the registry. In that case you could export the registry key content, and re-import everything back after closing the program, thus undoing the changes. Unlock Reverting back requires similar steps: you just need to change the file, like this: 

Stripping quotes The quotes might get in the way, but the batch script below can remove them for you. Just save it as (or whatever you like, just keep the extension). The script accepts two parameter: input/output files, respectively. Example usage 

The whole PC goes to sleep, not just the monitor. The hard drive turns off, wireless turns off, everything; this makes it impossible to play any music. To only turn off the screen turn the brightness all the way down; the lowest level will turn the backlight off (at least that's what happens on a 2007 MacBook). 

I'm not sure it's possible to do it from the command line using only built-in commands. But you can use 7-Zip from the command line; the great thing about 7-Zip is that it's free and open-source. Here's a quick tutorial on using the 7-Zip CLI. Hope this helps you out! 

Have you checked the ping time on speedtest.net? The most likely problem is latency in your case, which has a major impact on performance. Another metric to watch for is upload speed. I have a fast internet connection (50 Mb/s) but the bad part is the upload speed is pathetic (2 Mb/s), making overall browsing slower than I'd like. 

You should consider using Google Chrome for what you want. It installs to %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Google\Chrome (which can be written by the user) and does not need administrator privileges. If you install Chrome the normal way, via the installer provided by Google, it fails to install due to limited permissions. But there is an offline installer which does not need any rights. Edit: updated the link to the latest dev build of Chrome (as of 16.12.2009). The path is simply: 

This might work, although it's not very easy. However, it would be much easier to just use a normal USB stick that's large enough to hold the image; you can find out more about this here. As a side note, the steps used to manage installing from a USB stick or from the network drive in no way break the Mac OS X EULA or any other laws. 

Avoid all preconceptions regarding Vista, see it as a separate OS from XP, don't try to do it the XP way, do it the new way. If you follow this advice you'll be OK. For instance, a lot of people tend to go through all the setting in Control Panel just to get what they want (like in XP). There are too many settings in there, just search for what you want, it's faster and easier that way (search is very important in Vista). 

Note Paint and the built-in Snipping Tool can't be used: you'll need to rely on third-party programs. Working tools are e.g Lightshot, Greenshot, and ShareX. 

Press Win+R, type or paste in the text box, and press Enter. Navigate to User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar. Double-click the Do not allow pinning programs to the Taskbar policy, and set it to Enabled. 

Display a specific record All indexes are zero-based. For example, to get the first entry, type and press Enter: 

Userstyle If you have the Stylish add-on installed, you can use this: Hide #PanelUI-menu-button for firefox v29+. 

Note While you could just concatenate commands by using one ampersand (), a double ampersand will ensure that the second command is executed only if the previous one finished successfully. Further reading 

Internet Explorer 9 The standalone installer is available in the Microsoft Download Center. The website will still recommend a newer version, but you can actually choose IE 9 if you want to. In case you need it for testing purposes only, consider using the free virtual machines provided by Microsoft. This way you can test you application in multiple versions at the same time, and without having to upgrade/downgrade the browser in your main system. 

Create a new folder. Cut the shortcut, and paste it into the new folder. Create shortcuts pointing to the and folders. 

The program was installed on 2014/01/02 at 22:02 by selecting the Everyone option during setup (Install for anyone who uses this computer). Choosing Just me would install those .exe files in instead. Additional information The hexadecimal-named file is a startup stub just an icon file with a different extension and won't run manually because apparently it's not meant so because it's not an executable file at all. Here's an excerpt of the file content: 

Firefox settings Many settings, especially the most advanced ones, are not present in the User Interface (UI) options dialog. 

The valid range was , at least until Windows Server 2003. As of Windows 7, when you enable the 128-bit encryption option through the GUI, both are set to . Otherwise they're set to . Batch automation Here's a sample batch script which can apply the required changes automatically. Just make sure to run it with administrator rights. 

The behavior described above still applies as of version . The cache size will also determine the maximum size for cached files, which is 1/8 of the total amount in bytes. Anything bigger won't be cached on the disk. Chrome doesn't provide a way to change its cache size through the user interface. In order to override the default limit you either need to use a specific switch/flag or enable a group policy setting. Before proceeding, make sure empty the entire cache and then close the browser. To check whether the changes were applied successfully you can use this internal page afterwards: 

Try reinstalling iTunes. That usually does the trick and is usually the fastest way of solving such problems. 

Install PDF Creator (it's free and relatively lightweight) and follow these instructions that would allow you to use it from the command line. If you can use it from the command line it would make it rather easy to integrate in your app. Just send the command to print the Powerpoint file as jpg or png. 

Have you tried Live Mesh? It only offers 5 GB, but it's quite a good service; works on Windows and Mac OS X. 

Most antivirus manufacturers have their own databases including their own naming rules for the viruses they know are out there. Instead of trying to find out what Norman antivirus thinks the file is, try installing a different antivirus (Microsoft Security Essentials comes to mind, it's really good and free) with a good track record instead of Norman antivirus. Odds are you'll also find more information about the virus (if it really is that) if you look up the name it's been given by Microsoft, Symantec or Kaspersky. 

Find Disk Management in Administrative Tools. That should help you partition your hard drive. The best thing is that it's built in in Windows and it's free. 

It's region specific. I have Windows XP set up with Romanian regional settings; that automatically changes the first day of the week to Monday, but you can't change only that setting by yourself. However, looking over this thread over on tomshardware.com, there is a registry setting that can change this. I'm not sure what will happen, but you can take a look there and see (though I strongly recommend not mucking about with the registry unless it's really needed and you know what you're doing): 

Theoretically, any app that supports MathML (Mathematical Markup Language) can be used with the Windows 7 Math Input Panel. The Math Input Panel only works with programs that support MathML. Here are a few such apps: StarOffice, OpenOffice, Opera and Maple. 

The best time tracking application, as votes by the readers of Lifehacker, was Klok. You can read more about it here. 

They' re all pretty much the same. I think you're more limited by your download speed than by the speed of the bittorrent app. However, uTorrent has a very low resource consumption. I highly recommend it. 

You will be then able to treat those shortcuts just like regular files. When you're done, make sure to rename them back to restore their usual functionality. 

Note Keep in mind the variable is missing the drive letter from the path, so you might want to set the value to instead. Alternatively you could use too. 

Resolution If you do use ServeToMe, you can disable the startup entry if you want to avoid automatic launch. You would then need to run the program manually when required. If you don't need it, you can simply uninstall it. References 

As you're not looking for a specific text, this method should work in most Windows locales catching multiple error messages without extra effort. Example output 

This problem is called DLL stomping, and usually occurs when a program overwrites a system library with an earlier, incompatible version. Running quickly confirmed it: 

Windows 8.1 Update Among other things, the update brings the ability to pin Windows Store apps to the taskbar, just like regular programs. The Store app gets automatically pinned to the taskbar, probably in an effort to encourage people to try and explore modern apps. Unpinning Windows Store apps Usually you should be able to unpin Windows Store apps simply by right-clicking their icons on the taskbar. If you can't unpin apps that way, you can try from the Start screen instead: 

Open the Media > Convert / Save menu. Select the Network tab, and enter the stream url (e.g. ). Click the Convert / Save button. Select the Dump raw input option. Choose a name for the destination file, and click Start. 

How it works The output of the command is parsed line by line till the end. The last line is always the one which contains the free space amount, unless the path is invalid. To avoid having to deal with thousands separators (which are locale-aware, and can be customized), you need to use the parameter to strip them entirely. Each line gets tokenized by using spaces as separators, and the third token is then assigned to the variable each time. 

Just copy and paste the code in a new text file and save it as (or whatever as long as you keep the extension). 

Copy all the data from the original folder to the new one. Replace with the letter of system drive you got in step 2, and then verify that all files were copied successfully.
