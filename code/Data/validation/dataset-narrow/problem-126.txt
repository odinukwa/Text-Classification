1) Metrics show preference over another route with same prefix. For example you can assign a low metric on a fast interface and a higher metric on a slow interface. If the fast interface goes down for some reason the slow interface will be used. 2) Next hop is the gateway for this route. If your device is 192.168.1.100/24 and you want to add a static route for 10.0.0.0/8 with the gateway being 192.168.1.1, this is going to be your next hop. 3) There is no special order. After you enter all the routes you want they will be used depending on the closest match, e.g 10.0.0.1/32 is preferred over 10.0.0.0/24, or the metric. 

I haven't understood if you are or are not able to access the console when the device is not working. If you cannot access the console, it looks bad. Adding a syslog server is a very good idea, the device might send something prior to crashing. Check if the IOS you are running is fine or deprecated due to problems and upgrade accordingly. Usually such behavior is a good reason to open a tac case at cisco, provided you still have some support contract. 

I have seen the use of both terms. Are they the same thing or are there any differences between them? I have seen the use of "server name" on this Wikipedia page and on this Yahoo Answers page. 

I am trying to understand the DNS. Say I have a domain named . And let's say that we have the following FQDNs: 

Now my question is, what can I infer given this information? For example, can I infer that are geographically located in similar locations? (Because they are under the same subdomain: ). Or is it completely possible that one of them is located in say, US and the other in China? If not, what can I infer given this list of FQDNs? In other words, what is the purpose of the subdomain system? Also, if points to a computer, is it possible that points to a computer as well? 

It would actually be easier to network the entire room with ethernet and switches and run everyone through a data cap per line with the requirement that anyone who needs access has to register beforehand and bring a device capable of wired access. Disclaimer: While I have worked with wireless a lot and have read and attempted to research large installs I do not have any first hand experience with anything over 100 users per room, this is just some of what I have learned from years of puzzling over possibilities and reading varied sources. In my experience it's very difficult to get good performance out of wireless APs that are installed in any area with less than 50ft of clearance (just in general terms) + you would have the added difficulty of actually providing enough internet to service the backbone for the wireless. Sadly the cellular option probably isn't possible due to the same wireless limitations that are common with APs, regardless these are some things you will want to look into to check the overall usefulness of that option. 

1) Access points normally operate in L2. There are some exceptions to this, but let's stick to the rule. They are L2 devices cause they are forwarding frames based on decisions made by looking at the mac-address table they have. When some device connects on the wired or wireless interfaces, the AP learns its mac address from the broadcasts and stores the mac address in a list, depending from which interface the address was learnt. So when a frame arrives at the AP it will look up the mac table and decide on which interface it will be sent. 2) Regular access points shared the same logic as the switches. As I mentioned above, they have a mac address table were they store mac address associations depending on the interface the mac was learnt. 

You can start with 4x10Mbps lines and see how it goes, if clients utilize it all. For the wireless part I suggest the Unifi, which is easy to install and has good reviews. Moreover I wanted to install it too in a hotel but I keep postponing it. For router, since you mentioned Mikrotik, I was very satisfied by the 750G. It has 5 ports, so you can use one for downlink to switches and the other ports can connect to the uplink ISP, so you have 4 ports for ISP connections. Of course Alix boards with pfsense will also do the work you want. The other thing to take in consideration is how will you load balance the customers between the multiple wans. I think it would be easier to have all clients in same network and use one router in order to avoid messing with first hop redundancy issues. Moreover since you are not experienced keep it simple and not run dynamic routing with your isp. Switched don't have to be something special, something with gigabit ports is enough to relay wireless customers. 

This will be a kind of newbie question but I am not quite sure why we really need IPv6. AFAIK, the story is as follows: In the olden days, when computers were not plentiful, 32 bit IP addresses were enough for everybody. At these times, the subnet mask was implicit. Then the number of computers have increased and 32 bits started to become insufficient. So the subnet mask started to become explicit. Essentially the size of an IP address has increased. My question is, what is the downside of continuing the addressing with the subnet masks? For example when they become insufficient as well, can't we continue with using "subnet-subnet masks" etc.? I understand that it consumes more space than the original IPv4 (and maybe not much different than using IPv6) but aren't explicit subnet masks a sufficient solution? If not, why are they an insufficient solution? 

Things to keep in mind if you try to go the wireless AP route. If you do have to service all the visitors with just wireless access points then I would encourage you to give up on seamless coverage and instead try to layer 2.4 and 5 ghz radios using each radio as a way to increase the distance between radios on the same frequency and band. Just make sure to mark the areas that only have 2.4 and only have 5ghz coverage so everyone won't be caught off guard (I know it's not a good solution but it's the easiest and cheapest way to do it). Keep in mind that if you are assuming that there will be at least 6000 devices at moderate usage levels so it's possible that you will need as many as 240 APs (25 devices per AP, although you can reduce the number of AP by relying on a per radio count I'm not sure if that would be helpful). The radio strength of each AP will need to be set to the lowest strength allowed and it would be best if they were centrally managed to allow automatic dropping of clients that go more than a set distance from the AP (based on the client wireless strength). If you do attempt to provide internet, make sure to provide enough for everyone attending and actively ban the use of any wireless hotspots since they will only increase the number of wireless conflicts. I would encourage the registration of any visitors devices in advance so you can sort them into 5ghz, 2.4 ghz and low/high bandwidth groups and plan accordingly. Remember to count phones in addition to mobile computing devices and try to see if the visitors will be uploading content to the internet while present. In all honesty I see this as an almost impossible task but it should be doable with enough funds, make sure to bring someone onsite that has experienced it firsthand to minimize issues. 

Initially, I thought that the reason token ring uses a physical star topology is to make up for the shortcomings of a physical ring. That is: In a ring, when a failure occurs at any point, the system goes down. However, I have read the following about daisy chains in Wikipedia (emphasis by me): 

I was reading the HowStuffWorks article on ethernet. From the article, I understand that bridges are just like repeaters, but with the added benefit of not cluttering up other collision domains. So I understand that we can use a bridge wherever we can use a repeater. My questions is, if that's the case, why do repeaters still exist? Does it have to do with: 1) Bridges cost more than repeaters? 2) Bridges introduce a higher overhead? 

So it says that a message can be transmitted in both directions, which ensures the system not to go down in case of a failure at a point. My question is, if such thing is possible, why this isn't used in token ring as well? If it was used in token ring, then token ring wouldn't need a physical star topology. It could be a physical ring as well. So is there an error in this Wikipedia article or am I missing something?
