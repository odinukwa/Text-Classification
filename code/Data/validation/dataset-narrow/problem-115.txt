Highlight Bridge Identifier: 32768 / 0 / 00:17:ef:74:62:00 to check hex. In the hex values you look for your MAC and in front of that you would see the 2byte for the decimal value of 32768 (32768+0). So something like: 80 00 00 17 ef 74 62 00 

This is done due to the processing that RIP does with updates. For further understanding, class routing protocols as RIPv1 do not include subnet mask in the routing update. Nevertheless, the routing table includes RIPv1 routes with the net address as with the subnet mask. How would a router that runs RIPv1 determine the subnet mask that it must apply to a route added to the routing table? Here we have the rules to process RIPv1 routes: 

This process indeed takes effect with the usage of DBD packets as well as Type 3, 4 and 5 packets. let's see what each one contains: 

If you are a math type of person you may want to understand Dijkstra algorithm. Reading RFC2328 as mentioned by Ron is best option. If you are looking for a short down and dirty contribution I'll put it this way, yet feel free to dig links for in deep understanding. SPF does the calculation per-area basis on each router. Dijkstra algorithm evaluates 3DB's: 

I assume you just meant like any packet for which the MAC is not known. ARP (address resolution protocol) would take place for this matter. Below is a high level working of ARP operation. 

Based on your router specs -Interno DG200A- the answer is No. The best you can do with that device is some CoS to assign voice, video or other traffic to queues and prioritize/mark as needed. Check starting page 40 on the User Guide. For something more detailed or granular as you have requested the option would be to put another device in front of the router that can handle this or if you have some admin control over the users PC's, then check what specs does the OS provide for your needs. 

It might be an error, and the frame will be discarded. It may be an 'access' port from a service provider running 'provider bridging', then the frame will receive double tagging. It can get even more complex vlan translations. So it all depends on the full network setup. 

This is a quick recipe using Quagga pimd: 1) Setup Host1 static default route towards RouterA (you could also use an static specific route for the multicast group). 2) Make sure Host1 source is sending multicast stream with proper TTL (high enough to reach the receivers). 3) Make sure unicast routing towards multicast source is correct on RouterA. 4) Run Quagga pimd on RouterA: ATTENTION: pimd requires the zebra daemon: run zebra daemon before starting pimd. 

Move every /24 prefix in BGP one at a time. Before moving the first /24 prefix, establish an IP tunnel between the two locations. When you need to move one IP of a given /24 prefix, make location A to forward that address (a /32 route) thru the tunnel to location B. As soon as every address from one /24 prefix is going to location B via tunnel, move its BGP prefix announcement from location A to B. Repeat steps 3-4 for every /24 prefix. Bring down the tunnel. 

If you are running a Cisco switch, you can try to read the CISCO-VTP-MIB with an SNMP tool. For example: 

Due to its limitations (small hop count, slow convergence, possibly large periodic updates), RIPv2 has always been deemed inferior to alternatives like OSPF and IS-IS. However, over the years, people used to argue that both configuration simplicity and low impact on CPU would remain somewhat useful for corner-case applications. Does this still hold true? Nowdays, CPUs are faster, links are speedier, the other complex IGP alternatives are widely known. Can anyone please point specific use cases for considering RIPv2 in modern networking engineering? 

Remember that all routers in the OSPF area need to have the same LSDB to ensure accurate routing knowledge. The update indeed has to spread. RFC2328 states it as one hop at a time "A Link State Update packet may contain several distinct LSAs, and floods each LSA one hop further from its point of origination" 

Therefore, twice the time of the forward delay (listening time + learning time) contains all these parameters. The formula is: 

Both routes were External type 2, advertised the route as an OSPF E1, E1 is always preferred over E2 and this solved the issue. 

STP is used when you have redundant paths in order to avoid an endless loop which can harm your network. Based on your topology A<->B<->C this is a straight topology tree hence the STP might not be entirely necessary. There are two types of BPDU's: Configuration and Topology Change Notification. Do not confuse both. Config Bpdu is indeed used during initial setup to determine the root bridge and the best path cost to it, additionally depending on the port role a state will be assumed, ie: forwarding, blocking. TCN will be generated if somewhere on the topology an event (i.e: switch down, link down) caused the path to be affected. 3.The switch you call root bridge will only be elected so if it has the lowest bridge id (lowest priority, else, lowest priority plus lowest bridge address) through the configuration bpdu. This will occur all the way to your last switch so that they are in synch on who is the root. 4.For a detailed explanation on TC's feel free to check this 

Link-state Database: Total compilation of routing knowledge. Consist of tuples (router ID, neighbor ID and cost). Candidate Database: Tuples are evaluated. It deletes "any tuples whose neighbor ID is currently in the Tree DB and whose cost to the root is greater than the entry currently in the tree database." (Adv Junos Service Provider Routing, Ch2-44) Tree Database: Loop free and lowest cost topology. 

How do I tell Juniper EX4200 to push specific S-VLAN based on C-VLAN on q-in-q (dot1q-tunneling) port? For instance I want to instruct EX4200 to perform Q-in-Q using these rules: 

However its output is quite verbose. Of course one can write an output parser for extracting the view you need from the output of 'show bgp vpnv4 unicast all neighbors'. For example, see $URL$ Sample output: 

While VLAN is a tool often used to reduce the size of the broadcast domain, its major underlying goal was to partition a physical LAN device (switch, bridge) into multiple logical portions (VLANs). Think of a single physical device offering Ethernet LAN services for multiple departments within an organization. Every department would get a piece of that single physical device -- that is, some ports restricted into a VLAN. Thus one would not need to buy dedicated LAN hardware for every department. 

$URL$ Therefore, according my output (MSS 1240, peer MSS 9152, min MSS 1240, max MSS 1240), the ASR9K is limiting its outgoing TCP segments to 'MSS 1240'. 

Both AS A and AS C could use static default routing towards AS B. AS B could point specific static route X to A and specific static route Y to C. No dynamic routing protocol between AS'es. AS B could run OSPF between GW2 and GW3. 

Make sure your HTTP client is sending the same request for both cases. Request line format: Exemple for request line: In example above, Request-URI is If your client puts an IP addresses in the place of the hostname , the web server might issue a different result. See also: $URL$ 

Some tunneling technologies provide Ethernet over IP services. For instance, research about these topics: 

If you configure the 1921 LNS to request authentication from a RADIUS server, yes, it is possible, since you can use RADIUS to attach a specific address for every user. I do not know whether it is possible with local user authentication on the Cisco router itself. 

Some implementations set the ATT bit automatically and provide you a command or knob under a configuration stanza to disable it. i.e on Juniper: ignore-attached-bit 

Strictly speaking LSA T1 has only area scope so say for example routers in A0 will all eventually receive the Router LSA, now for that information to be carried to other area like A1 you would need a T3. 

For a network that is directly connected to the router (LAN) and not learned from a neighbor, you would need to add the interface from that network as passive in the configuration for advertising, this happens via router-lsa. From Advance Junos Service Provider Routing, Chapter 2-19, "A router advertises a stub network whena subnet does not connect to any OSPF neighbors. Advertising a stub network occurs for the loopback interface and any passive interfaces." 

In regards to your last comment I'll post as a separate answer because modifying existing answer changes it a bit. Let me break it the following way: First: 

Finally got my hands on PT version 7. Yes indeed as pointed out by @Zac67 check the serial ports. From the file you shared and after changing serial ports IP subnet it will still not work. If you check both routers none display the letter 'R' for RIP routes in "show ip route", yet when you run "show ip protocols" it does say RIP is advertising for both subnets, it is even reflected when running the debug. If you check both routing tables, both see 10.0.0.0/8 directly connected. For some reason RIP is not liking this fact when updating the route sent from the other peer. Split Horizon seems to be the key because they are both advertising the same subnet 10.0.0.0/8, and as you know, this would create a loop unless a loop prevention mechanism takes place. Anyways I changed the subnet from the other set of PC's to 192.168.4.0 , added RIP as version 2 and it worked. The following link you can download the modified version of the lab. 

You need to find both Distance and Speed for the electromagnetic waves for the specific transmission medium. For instance, for fiber: 

Are you sure both switches are forwarding IP packets? Usually routers have 'ip routing' enabled. Check all your devices for both 'ip routing' and 'ip cef': 

The first address A of the range has a sequence of H x 0's bits as least significant bits. The last address B of the range shares all the same (32-H) bits from A, AND has H x 1's for the least significant bits. 

If you are sending packets toward IP addresses of the device, it will need to handle those packets in the CPU. Consider enabling CoPP: $URL$ 

The non-NAT router is missing a route for the address 130.130.130.130. Try injecting the required route as static route and then redistribute it into OSPF of NAT router: 

EX4200 switch has a firewall filter applied to input of trunk port. Intent is to rate-limit (police) input bandwidth per VLAN id. However the 'show firewall' command points out that policing is taking place only for the filter last "catch all" term (so named ACCEPT_OTHER_VLANS). Traffic from VLAN115 is actually being policed at the 2Mbps limit of the ACCEPT_OTHER_VLANS term. The configuration looks fine to me. Question: For this specific hardware/software, can anyone spot 

Because 121.34.56.64/24 includes the range 121.34.56.64–121.34.56.128 but ALSO includes OTHER addresses not belonging to the range 121.34.56.64–121.34.56.128. 

No, not exactly. There is not a regular masking operation taking place. There is no software querying the CAM/TCAM at forwarding time. While usual memory is designed to be queried by a 'memory address' (pointer), CAM/TCAM is a kind of memory circuit (hardware) designed to lookup by content. It does in hardware what a hash table does in software: an associative array. The point is: TCAM can be programmed with a network prefix entry. For instance, you can insert a /24 prefix into TCAM by marking last 8 bits as "DON'T CARE". With plain binary CAM, you can't insert IP prefix, you can only insert full IP address (or MAC addresses) as lookup key. 

However R10 does not have one being advertised, hence you are missing the network x.x.x.x config. Cisco IOS IP Routing: BGP Command Reference 

Correct, each MST instance has its own topology parameters. I know you tagged Cisco, but if someone from Juniper also needs to check for their wording: Understanding MSTP for EX Series and QFX Series Switches 

eth.src is the media access control address (MAC address) of the device which is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network segment. In terms of STP Bridge system identifier (BID) is a unique identifier composed by priority and MAC address. So depending on the priority(32768 is the default value) which is in configured in increments of 4096 you will have different values showing on the BID. EDIT HERE In regards to your comment concern: 

End election is validated when no more better (lower BID's) are received from neighbor switches. When the switches first come up, they start the root switch selection process. Each switch transmits a BPDU to the directly connected switch on a per-VLAN basis. The Configuration BPDU has the BID (bridge priority and unique device identifier) and it used during initial setup to find out who will be the root bridge. Lower is preferable. Recall the STP states: 

For this there is a short answer concerning 3DB's: OSPF loop avoiding Basically each node put's itself at the root of the tree and determines the lowest cost and loop free path for each destination. Concerning: 

Steps taken from SRX650 Services Gateway Hardware Guide, you can also see the sampling of the above steps if in doubt. System default security Deny all transit traffic. 

"Im also unable to distinguish between LSA used while forming adjacency and LSA types, as in router lsas, network lsas,etc. If the LSA types are only sent after the adjacency is formed, then how come the different packets used while forming adjacency know about the Link State Advertisements?" A/ Basically dissect the headers. Database description through LS type from the LSA header and Link-State request packet field LS type, both specify (example: router lsa, summary lsa, nssa). "If Router A has only directly connected networks in the database and hasn't received any LSAs from other routers, then how can it send the received LSAs to the other connected router, say Router B." A/ I'll elaborate with what I think is your doubt, if not please correct. "The router-LSA then describes the router's working connections (i.e., interfaces or links) to the area. Each link is typed according to the kind of attached network." pag127 Basically there are 4 Link Type's: 

The command does NOT insert prefixes into BGP route table. That command is used to FILTER prefixes when the router announces or learns prefixes from BGP peers. A common Cisco idiom for locally injecting prefixes into BGP is combining the BGP "network" statement with static routes to Null0: 

Number of interfaces: 3 2) Given the destination IP address A.B.C.D, take the least significant byte D. Example: IP = 1.0.0.5, D = 5 3) Divide the value of D by the number of interfaces, take the remainder, then and add one to it. 

ECMP takes place when multiple output (equal-cost) paths are available for forwarding packets to the same network destination. The hash function must map information from the incoming packet to the output interface. For example, let me make up an illustrative overly simple hashing function for this: 1) Picture every output interface with an ifIndex like this: 

Source-based tree: A non-shared multicast distribution tree (forwarding/replication state on intermediate routers) is built for every SOURCE,GROUP pair. Source-based tree is unidirectional. Shared tree: A per-group multicast distribution tree is built on routers, shared by all group's senders and receivers. The shared tree might be bidirectional. 

No. TCAM circuitry can DIRECTLY lookup keys against entries built with 0s and 1s and Xs (X=don't care). For instance, you could insert entry=1.0.0.X then you can lookup key=1.0.0.1. The TCAM circuitry will find and return the matching 1.0.0.X entry (plus its associated information) without doing the "formal" masking you seem to be picturing. However, TCAM lookup does a kind of masking to distinguish between "care bits" and "don't care bits" 

The command 'show bgp vpnv4 unicast all neighbors' will display BGP neighbor status for VPNv4 family, including VRF information. 

5) Install Quagga pimd on RouterB, in order to run this IGMPv3 join tool: RouterB: 6) Use Quagga pimd commands on RouterA to verify multicast. For instance: RouterA: RouterA: 7) If things aren't working as expected, try pimd troubleshooting commands:
