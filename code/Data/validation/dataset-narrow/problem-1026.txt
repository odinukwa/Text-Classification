When you open the calendar settings dialog, and open the share settings for this calendar, hover over the entry for the user you want to fully share with, and you should see options to enable editing/deleting/..., like this: 

I think I saw on the mailing list somwhere that there will be an update from 4.5.x to 5.0.x... I will post the link here if I find it again. As far as I can remember, there will be some more time waiting for major bugs before the upgrade link to 5.0 is released - as there were quite a few in the 5.0.[0-2] releases, hopefully most of them are now resolved with the 5.0.3 release. The basic upgrading process is described here: $URL$ (use the "Upgrade" instructions!). Most of your questions should be answered there, I'll try a quick summary: 

The public link that is sent out, as far as I know, is assembled from the URL you're accessing ownCloud under when you create the share. So one option is to also access ownCloud via that `$URL$ url when creating the share. Another option, I think, would be to change the overwritehost setting in your config.php; that should also always be used; but it also has other sideeffects. 

So first you click on the share icon (marked 1), then you get to the share dialog. make sure the second checkbox (2) is ticked. If you want to determine in more detail which permissions the other user should have, open up the detailed settings by clicking on the button marked with the circle (3), you will get the additional "create", "change", "delete" checkboxes as you can see in the picture. In case you don't see the share button, then your owncloud Administrator hasn't enabled sharing. Either ask your administrator to enable it, or if you yourself are the admin, go to the Admin settings, find the Share section and enable it: 

Yes this is possible. You can set up any directory for synchrisation with the client. Additional sync directories can be configured by right-clicking on the tray icon and selecting "Add folder"... simply enter a different directory as needed on each client! The default sync directory "clientsync" is configured during client setup, but you can remove this as well in the dialog that pops up when you select "Open status" from the context menu Tested with ownCloud 4.5.8 (should work the same with the new 5.0.3) and client 1.2.3. 

If I understand correctly you want to change the default data directory? This is extensively handled in the FAQ in the ownCloud forum here: $URL$ Basically, if you have already installed ownCloud, change the "datadirectory" setting in your config.php. But you have to be careful to also copy all data from the old location to the new one. The easier option is to select "Advanced" during setup, and directly enter the desired path in the corresponding input field. 

You cannot natively pass a password to the command, however you may consider looking at PsExec from SysInternals. 

If you bought it a week ago, you might try returning it to the store you bought it from and exchanging it for another one, a different model, or a different brand altogether. 

Notice the host color is different? I copied the entire folder over to the computer, but it's still not working. The only difference I can think of is the version - 2.1.2, vs. 2.5.0. Here's my : 

Unfortunately this is not possible to do exclusively with Group Policy. You will need to consider one of the other 3rd party solutions to accomplish what you want. (Those, however could be controlled through GP if you like?). Here is a supporting TechNet thread. 

In the end, you may find that breaking up your function into several chunks (or using matching) will help you strip it apart. Here is a basic summary of what I've ended up using: 1: Set some global variables to allow for flexibility: 

Edit: In the end, if you actually just want the python script I've written, let me know and I'll post it on sourceforge or git. 

Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions are available at a discount for those who already own CS6; you may find it a more cost effective upgrade to go straight to CC rather than upgrade to the CS6 suite of apps. More information can be found on Adobe's CC membership plans here. 

If you're still getting nowhere, you might try a 3rd party firmware (DD-WRT, Tomato). If after that you still haven't gotten anywhere, you've spent more hours than your time is worth, and you might just want to buy a new router ;) 

Your virtual machine, if properly isolated from your web services, wouldn't likely be vulnerable to attack unless your entire machine / root account were compromised. That said, if you're concerned about data performance/reliability/resiliency on the NAS instance, you're going to find that running your NAS off of a virtual machine with (unknown) specs is probably going to cause you more headache than it's worth if you're hosting existing server-services on the host OS. If your specs on the existing desktop are less than spectacular, you'd be better too obtain a new dedicated box for your NAS. If your specs are high-end, you may want to consider a hypervisor solution (like VMware ESXi) and virtualize both your web server and your NAS in isolation on top of ESXi. 

Inspecting the output from running , it kindly indicates that it's logging to . The notable part it says: 

Add a password (or change it) to your computer and set up sharing to be password protected. Set up a personal firewall and forcibly block access from your roommate's IP address. 

I think by disabling the 'separate spacies' functionality of Mavericks, you should be able to accomplish this: Click on System Preferences > Mission Control > Un-tick “Displays have separate Spaces”. Once your restart your Mac, you will have just a single menu bar. Done. 

The folder (C:\Windows\Installer) on my Windows 7 installation holds 1GB of installers are these necessary or can these be deleted ? If so are there any other places where Windows 7 saves the installers which are used to install files and can they be removed ? 

There have been a number of 'event 37' logged at different times just today in the error log. Any idea how to solve this error i have installed all the drivers and the firmware and this error has just occurred lately I have been using Windows 7 for atleast 2 months now ( I reloaded my entire installation just today and it shut down again without any warning so now this is getting me worried) 

This should take you through 5 stages of the scan and will unset that dirty bit.Since this will have to run a checkdisk on your C drive it will ask you to run it on your next restart. 

I face internet time-outs often and my ftp client just abandons the file upload/download mid-way. Is there a client that supports auto-resume for upload and download of files? The software can be free or paid I don't mind. My OS is Windows 7 

Is there a specific path or a registry where the library settings are stored. So that i can backup and restore my libraries when ever I restore my computer using an image or reinstall my computer 

Can the mouse still move when your keyboard stops to respond? How long did you keep the computer on, while its on this screen? I suggest that you leave it at this screen for sometime (give it even 20 - 30 mins). Also what are your hardware specs? 

Can Windows Defender be permanently uninstalled/removed from my current Windows 7 installation, it can't be done through the Add/Remove Programs Wizard. 

If you don't mind the cost then you could backup to 2 places, one could be purely an online backup service along with drop-box. This link could throw some light into alternate backup services. And if you are real finicky about your backups, you could reserve and entire partition or a hard-drive to sync your matter locally, continuously and real time like what DropBox does. You can achieve this using Acronis True Image Home, or CrashPlan. CrashPlan has a free version, but for continuous backup you need CrashPlan+ which a paid version. 

You can use a Windows 7 DVD and use the repair wizard to see if windows can fix it for you. If you don't have a Windows 7 DVD then download the Windwows 7 Repair Disk from the links end of this page. Give it a shot and let us know what happens. 

Wireshark is network protocol analyzer and is available for Linux, PC and Mac. Like fiddler it allows you to scan TCP streams and allows deep inspection of hundreds of protocols. Please take a look at features in the about page. 

Quite confident there is no way to do this on the device itself. Microsoft mentions the following: $URL$ 

POP3 is a one-directional protocol, in that once you download mail, it resides on your POP3 mail client, and has no further communication with the server until the next time you poll for new mail. This article elaborates: $URL$ Some mail servers block the POP3 'delete' function and retain a copy on the server, but unlike IMAP, there is no client/server relationship. Your best option is to re-create your mail profile using IMAP (or Exchange ActiveSync if it's an Exchange/Outlook.com server) so that your client can bi-directionally communicate with the server. 

You don't need to spend that much on obtaining a firewall product that offers you granular control over NAT/masquerading. Some standalone firewall/gateway products that will install on minimal hardware: 

I'm using Fish shell/omf, NVM ($URL$ and Sublime Text 3. I'm trying to use a build system to run (which I installed with ). works fine from within a native Fish shell: 

I couldn't find anything specific from Apple, but similar to Windows, it doesn't appear to be possible. 

Your best bet is to use a can of compressed gas (available at most computer/stationary stores). You can find a lot more information in this PC World article, and I'm sure there are many others around the Internet. 

I've spend several hours writing and fine-tuning a python script to do exactly this. One of the things I've found is that quite often it's not as black and white as handling a single file like this. Note: This is python based, which will require tweaking if you're working in another language Why I'm telling you this: 

I have a Windows share mounted in OSX 10.9 Finder (through ⌘+K) that acts bizarre every so often (can't log in sometimes, randomly disconnects from the GUI claiming it can't access the mounted volume). Usually I have to reboot to force-disconnect this mounted SMB drive; is there a way to do it through terminal? (Like say, using ?) 

(expected, from what I understand). The problem: Sublime doesn't seem to recognize the NVM path. Take this build system: 

Agreed that this should probably be migrated, but in the meantime, here is some insight for you. Caveat: On the whole, this is not best practice for a setup using the technology you've indicated; you'd gain far more reliability and performance by running your configuration directly off of the hypervisor and either getting software RAID to manage your disks directly, or spending the money to purchase a hardware RAID card. (Answering 2. first, for logistics) 2: You haven't specified, I'm going to assume you plan on using ESXi. An isolated mirrored set will offer the the most reliable configuration the ESXi OS. If you're concerned about resiliency/fault tolerance of the hypervisor, again I would strongly recommend against using software RAID to do this at all (ESXi doesn't play nice with most software RAID, and even if your controller is supported, you're still dealing with (at best) BIOS-based software RAID reliability and performance). If you decide to do this, ensure that your data/VM disk set is entirely independent from your hypervisor disk set, and back up your ESXi configuration frequently. 1: Once you have your hypervisor running, assuming ESXi supports your hardware for Raw Device Mapping you could then expose your SAS disks directly to your virtual BSD instance and z-pool/z-raid them as you like, exposing them via NFS to other VMs or computers in your house. If ESXi doesn't support RDM for your hardware, the only other option would be to create virtual volumes from the ESXi hypervisor and expose them to your virtual BSD instance. Why this is a very bad idea: you're layering a software RAID filesystem on top of virtual partitions. If you lose your z-pool configuration, you're liable to lose the entire array because you're dealing with a physical file system (ZFS) sitting on top of a virtual filesystem (VMFS). 

I had installed Windows Xp on my Dell Inspiron 1525 which originally shipped with Windows Vista Home Premium, it started acting up a bit so I decided to shift back to windows vista. While deleting the boot partition in Vista for some reason it deleted both my boot an data partition and all I can see now is a single unallocated partition along with the recovery partition which Dell laptops ship with. How do I get back all my data back ? I'm super worried some one help! I have lost a lot of important data which i don't have backups of! 

I created a new image using Acronis True Image 2010 Home (boot cd) just yesterday. Today when I used the boot media again to create a new image I face an error. It initially boots correctly but then it goes into a black screen before it reaches the interface and the Caps-Lock and Scroll-Lock key blink together and then nothing happens. Has anyone faced such an error before? What is the problem as my computer boots into Windows correctly. Additional input: It boots to the interface if I use the safe version, is it okay to use the safe version? 

What's the difference between Hostname and Domain name? especially in regards to NIC Could someone please elaborate with examples as this concept is a little confusing 

Use BartPE or Gparted to format or delete the required partitions. Edit: Found you another solution SuperFdisk 

I have added my DVD drive in the FreeNAS Web Interface (from Disks - Management). Now I want to access it as a Windows share (i.e. access it on my windows network) hence I tried mounting it but I keep getting an error - retry once its mounted. How do I share this DVD drive on the entire network, as I want to allow network reading and burning through this drive. 

Kindly write back what happens after these initial checks, so that we know that the hardware has been placed correctly on the board. If you still face any problems after these steps we can take it further from there. The main problem with people new to hardware is that there is a huge possibility that parts are not been plugged in well to the motherboard, not doubting your computer assembling skills here but its best to be sure first, than sorry later. 

Need a software for documenting my work & research. I was considering to use blog engine but then I don't want to be playing around with backing up the databases and the matter separately. The specifications for the software would be: 1) To catalogue work by categories, tags and date. 2) Easy editing and drawing features 3) Easily incorporate saved html files into matter I'm writing, with the formatting and pictures. (probably use the mht format, don't want to be wasting timeformatting html pages) Would like the html pages to be directly displayed in the software and not opened on demand Software should be for Windows. Any recommendations? 4) Language tools could be an addition but only an optional feature
