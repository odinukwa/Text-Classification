Within the same LAN segment? No. Between LAN networks, you can see the same IP address. But within that network, all the IPs have to be unique. So in Site A you've got a LAN with IPs 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255 And in Site B (connected to site A via a router with NAT enabled on it) you've got a LAN with the same IPs - 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255 This is possible. But within the same network, having two hosts both with IP 192.168.1.1 is not possible, it will clash. NAT is mainly so that you can use the same private IPs between sites. Just imagine if for site A we could use 192.168.1.0-255 and for site B we had to use 192.168.2.0-255. And similarly for site C,D,E... you didn't have the option to use 192.168.1 or .2 subnets? That'd lead to a lot of waste in terms of usable IP addresses wouldn't it? Hence, NAT allows same IP ranges to be used between segments. But no you definitely, not with NAT or anything for that matter, have two hosts on the same segment both with the same IP address. It has to be unique. Hope it helped! 

So now, my doubt is, will R2 receive the update with a metric of 4 or will it receive it with a metric of 5? The reason I ask is because I've learnt that when you apply an offset-list as outbound, it sends the metric as it is configured while when you set it as inbound, it adds the received metric to the offset-list value. Also if we follow the logic that routers increment hop count and then send the update out rather than increment it on receiving an update, this should be correct. But on GNS3 and in a few other places, it says that R2 will receive the update with hop count 5 when by my understanding, it should be 4. Is this a bug in GNS3 or is it how it really works? I'm practicing everything with regard to Cisco 3700 series routers 12.4 IOS version. Any help would be much appreciated! 

What will happen (and is happening now) is that most of the users (eg. home users) will be put behind carrier-grade NAT. There is pretty-much enough IPv4 addresses for those who really need them (globally looking, not saying company XYZ has enough of them). This means you will pay X money for an internet connection, and you will have to pay Y more money, to get a public IPv4 address (where you can get one at all). This means most home users will still have a working (but NAT-ted) connection, and people needing a public IPv4 address will be able to buy/rent it. This will free alot of addresses in some places. IPv6 will be (and currently is, depending on the country, ISP,..) deployed in parallel to current IPv4 infrastructure. Depending on access type, this may need just a click in a dashboard, software update, or a hardware upgrade too. For your questions: 

Not really. "Names" are used for TLS. You might have problems if you use ancient software which doesnt support IPv6 at all, but this is not TLS specific. 

If you have IPv4 connectivity, or some kind of translation mechanism, then yes, your computer will use IPv4. Otherwise no. But you shouldn't worry about this much... when there are alot of IPv6 only-people, and those sites start losing visitors/customers, they'll switch to IPv6. 

If you have IPv4 connectivity (through NAT or some kind of translation mechanism on your router), then yes. Otherwise, no. 

So when enabling object tracking on an AVF for an ISP uplink (for example), while running GLBP on another interface of the router, we specify a weight range and tell the AVF that if object loses its IP reachability, the weight is dropped below a certain limit and if that is below the lower limit specified, that router can no longer be part of the GLBP process (or does it become an SVF?). I'm not even sure if my question makes sense but, why is this range even required? Is there any other use of enabling this range? If the uplink goes down, why not just directly take the router out of the AVF role, what's the need for checking with a range? 

So I was understanding how inter-vlan routing happens using L3 switches (using the c3650 series) and came across something I couldn't find solid information on (or I don't know how to search for it). I was trying to do inter vlan routing between 3 switches. I created two SVIs to represent hosts and assigned them to VLAN 10 and 20 respectively. Without using the ip-routing command, I was able to ping SVIs belonging to different VLANs on different switches! All the switches were configured with VLAN 10 and 20 but what I didn't understand is how they were able to contact each other without the routing functionality enabled! When we do RoaS, we have a router that does the routing function for us. But when it comes to an L3 switch, without enabling ip routing, how is it routing between the two SVIs? They're part of two different subnets! I had heard that this phenomenon was only because SVIs are internal to the switch and hence there's no egress ingress traffic to need routing. On enabling debugging, I came across the term "LOCAL CLUSTER" and on searching about it, couldn't exactly find the solution I was looking for but I feel it might have something to do with this. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks in advance. 

No, we can't. What we can do, with better modulation, is approach the shannon limit more closely. Otherwise, if you need more bandwidth (in megabits), either increase the bandwidth (in (mega)Hertz), or increase the signal/lower the nose to get better SNR. 

Not really. If you signed up for an internet connection, you'd probably get put behind NAT or be dual-stacked, but most users wouldn't notice that (they usually have no idea about IPs, addresses, etc... alot of people called my ISPs helpdesk when Facebook was down for ~30 minutes, complaining that their internet doesn't work) 

TCP header is located after the IP header, so the TCP/IP stack knows all four (and many more) values. Those four values are used to form a unique connection ID ("socket"), which is used to recieve and send packets to/from the remote host. 

By default it is set to 20, but you can change the value to 40 (or more). Proper way to do this would be via sysctl setting. For the second part, if all the devices were in the same multicast group, all the devices would recieve all the other packets from all the other devices (as in broadcast), which can cause more power usage and/or processing power usage on embedded devices. 

Mostly, no. Most home routers don't support such translations. But this won't be a problem due to carrier grade NAT (so you still get IPv4 connectivity). 

Since the addresses have the same first 21 bits, the mask is then /21 (255.255.248.0) . Otherwise you can do it in the head for simple case: x.x.x.0-255 is /24, two of those networks (starting on an even number) are /23, 4 are /22, 8 are /21 (135-128=8). 

Routing tables usually have a default path. Packets that don't meet the longest match for any entry in the routing table are then forwarded through the default route. There also exists Proxy ARP which can help find destinations that aren't in it's local routing table. But definitely the router doesn't forward packets out all interfaces in case it can't find the destination, it just drops the packets, in which case you'd get a destination unreachable or timed out or some error depending on the situation. 

How is 2^11 = 121? Firstly, 2^11 = 2048. The formula for finding the number of valid hosts are (2^n)-2 which is 2046. The 2 being the broadcast address and network address. In the example you've given, 10.0.0.0 is given as the network ID. Since the mask is a 255.255.248.0 one, it means that the hosts jump in terms of 8 hosts, and will have 32 subnets. The broadcast ID of the first network will be 10.0.7.255. So the network ID of the next subnet will be 10.0.8.0, while it's broadcast ID will be 10.0.15.255 and so on. You're not clear with your logic of subnetting. Please watch a few videos on how to subnet. I suggest this one and the rest of their series. 

I don't know if this will help, but when I want to add similar lines to various devices, I connect to each device on various tabs in SecureCRT and then at the bottom there's a window that provides a "chat to all tabs" capability. I use that.
