1) Easiest thing to do is Google the drives. Both of these are normal hard drives. (Easiest way to eyeball is to notice that they have RPMs listed!) Generally a solid state drive is going to OBVIOUSLY be a solid state drive - manufacturers want to advertise this fact. (They're also not usually coming from traditional hard drive manufacturers like WD and Seagate - most SSDs are made by memory manufacturers.) 2) For all intents and purposes, at least until you get to issues like TRIM, the technology of the physical media doesn't matter, just the interface. A SATA drive is a SATA drive and a filesystem is a filesystem. I have heard that journaling is a poor choice for an SSD simply due to the write load, but in the absence of hard numbers I suspect this is simply fearmongering. 

If the displays are not the same resolution, there is no way to do this. The borders are on a pixel to pixel ratio - the best you can do is to adjust the alignment in the screen resolution settings to be the way that you want it. There may be a third-party workaround, but I don't know of one off hand. If the displays ARE the same resolution, this shouldn't be happening. Of course, that's unlikely to be the case here if you have a 22" in portrait because I assume the laptop is in landscape. 

The message seems to indicate that the master wireless switch is turned off. You don't mention this in your post. Unfortunately, I am not familiar with the exact model, but most of these machines have a physical wireless toggle switch on them - the software controls won't work if it's turned off. 

A good starting point is to try running from an elevated command prompt. The report generated may pinpoint an issue. USUALLY, this sort of behavior is caused by a bad device driver (or a piece of hardware itself) or system service, but picking through them one by one can be awfully time consuming if there's no pattern to what causes the problem. 

EDIT: I seem to have possibly misread the question (judging from the upvotes I guess I wasn't the only one). If you're using your work laptop at home, it's very unlikely that they'll be able to see anything on any other machines on that network. There are ways of doing it, but nothing that's very likely to be in practice. It's not something I'd worry about. Original answer follows the break, which is the case for things you do ON the work laptop at home. 

That looks like a standard OEM pack. If you crack that cardboard sleeve, what you should see are the things detailed here by Microsoft as making it legit. 

Try F1 to enter the BIOS, F9 to load defaults, F10 to save and exit. Both F9 and F10 will give you a yes/no prompt, but unfortunately I don't know if they default to 'yes' or 'no'. 

As noted in the chosen answer for the question you linked, REGARDLESS of if it's OEM or not, it is against the terms of the license agreement to install it on more than one machine simultaneously, period. You can TRANSFER a retail key. It's very possible your university does have a volume licensing agreement or other special dispensations of some sort. The only way to find out for sure is to ask Mr. Mean and Grumpy, I'm afraid. 

The best way is to install Windows Vista or 7 - the driver model makes these conflicts much less of a problem. There's no way you can get these two cards to work in tandem under XP as is and have proper functionality for four outputs, and I speak from the standpoint of a specialist in multiple monitor setups. Either buy new cards, or try another OS (I can't guarantee it'll work, but it's much more likely). EDIT: Just to make this more explicit, since it came up in the comments, Ramhound is right that there's a very real possibility the older card Just Won't Workâ„¢ in a newer OS. In my experience, a lot of cards this age and older do work fine with the stock Microsoft drivers, but I can't speak for this particular one, so try at your own risk, of course. You're sure as hell not going to get them running under XP with any reasonable effort, though. 

UltraMon lets you customize application shortcuts to force a given window to open at a specific location and size. (I'd suspect similar applications like DisplayFusion and Actual Multiple Monitors do this as well, but I can't speak firsthand.) 

It's hard to say without specifics on the machine and what's running, but more than likely there's either A: A particular process running or B: A device driver that doesn't play as well with hibernation in 7 as it does in XP. It's also possible you simply have more utilization under 7 period which is exacerbating the problem. EDIT: I'm assuming that everything works normally in both, it's just slower in 7. There's nothing inherently slower about the process under 7 so it must be something else. 

It's worth noting that this could be a problem with the computer itself, or the cable you're using, or even the power connection. Try swapping all those things around and see if you can get this to work on another system with differing configuration. If it's not detected at all after all that, there's almost certainly something wrong with the controller on the drive. You're probably out of luck unless you want to look into professional data recovery - that's expensive, and if you started to format the drive may be nontrivial to boot (although it can probably be done). The fact that you got the message randomly to format the drive makes me think it's a controller problem as well - you should never be asked to format an already-formatted drive out of the blue. 

If you just changed monitors or resolutions or especially monitor orientation (or just moved to Win7) you should try adjusting your ClearType settings. The easiest thing to do is just search 'ClearType' on the Start Menu, select the result for 'Adjust ClearType text', and go through the wizard steps. This will adjust the smoothing on the fonts and should result in sharper text. 

It could simply be a faulty adapter, or a problem with the input port itself (a damaged pin or the like). Try another adapter, or the same adapter on a different machine. There could be a problem with the internal graphics card as well, although that's relatively unlikely if the internal display is working fine. Still, to rule it out, you'd need to try an entirely different monitor on this machine. 

The setting you're looking for is "Audit Logon Events" - you can set it to log on success or failure individually. 

I've used Paragon's tool (we lucked out and picked it up for FREE during a promo, you might manage the same if you watch long enough) which works like a charm and I believe will work with pretty much any partition scheme out there. Basically you just point it at the partitions, it boots into a special environment, rebuilds them, and you're good to go. If you don't want to use any third party software, you're better off formatting from scratch. (Keep in mind, if you're using Windows, that Vista and 7 align partitions correctly when they create them, but if the drive was originally formatted with XP you need to rebuild the partitions.) 

I've used Dekisoft's Monitor Off Utility successfully before on desktops, but I can't promise that it'll function properly with the built in monitor on a laptop. It's worth a try, though. You can manually cut off the displays from the system tray or set up a hotkey for it. 

There are a few good ones posted here already - I'd add AnandTech's benchmarks, which are good for more than just processors. 

According to the Microsoft Building Windows 8 Blog, storage spaces are not bootable. They allude to being able to put the bootloader elsewhere, but that's not easily done from in the installer (and details are lacking as of this writing). Doesn't look like it would help you anyway, given that you only have the two drives. 

You could damage the fan from spinning it that way. You could also damage many components in the PC using a vacuum cleaner - it generates a large amount of static electricity! You should NEVER use a vacuum on electronic equipment! The proper thing to do would be to open the machine out and blow the dust free with non-static compressed air. (It's best to hold fans still rather than letting them spin freely for the same reason having the vacuum spin them up is bad, but very few people bother to do this because with quick bursts of air the odds are very slight.) 

This sounds like a specific problem with a specific missing device. Are all drivers installed for ALL these motherboards or just the one you prepped it on? Are you running in AHCI mode with a different AHCI controller across the boards? This is pretty weird and it pretty much HAS to be a specific piece of hardware causing it. 

USB 3.0 resides on a separate controller, and it needs a driver. You should check with the vendor of the laptop to see if there's a Windows 8 compatible driver out for this yet. 

As mentioned in the comments above, you are limited to two outputs on this card when running Windows XP. Sounds like it's time for an upgrade! 

This is excessive for a non-enterprise SSD. To put this in comparison, for Intel consumer SSDs (which are commonly considered by far the best drives on the market in terms of reliability rather than raw benchmark numbers), Intel guarantees that they'll do 20GB of writes per day for the entire warranty period without exhausting the drive. You're doing significantly more than that, and if it's not an Intel drive there's no guarantee that it's as resilient, so while this isn't a short-term concern I might be concerned about the longevity of this. Enterprise SSDs are generally using SLC NAND rather than MLC NAND, which is much more resilient to exhausting the write capacity of the cells and generally will allow an order of magnitude or higher of writes. It isn't in common usage simply because it's still significantly more expensive. I would recommend for a workload like this that you buy an SLC drive. 

The answer is 'maybe, but it depends on what that other card is'. Some cards will play nicely, and some won't. If it's another nVidia Quadro, it'll almost certainly work with no trickery on your part. (If you want to update the question with the exact model of that other card, I am sure we can get you a better answer.) 

It might be easiest to simply add them all to a playlist in the media player of your choice, and play them selectively that way. (There are enough players that will function like this that I'm hesitant to even name names, but personally I still use Winamp Pro.) 

Depending on what OS you're using and what specific info you need, you might look at TCPView or Wireshark. 

Some countries use 110V power. Some countries use 220V power. You should use whichever is correct for the power mains in the location where you are. I am surprised to hear that this isn't a unit that supports both specs, but I'm not super familiar with printers so maybe that would be difficult to do. Most computing equipment these days supports both standards with a manual toggle, though. (These numbers are old specs and the actual power these days I believe is 120V/230V but essentially it comes down to this. More to the point, you can probably only easily find the correct one in your location.) 

The easiest thing to do in the case where the password was added recently, without using third party software, is to boot to the Windows CD (if you have one! but I think any Windows 7 disk should work) and do a manual System Restore to before you set the password (you can't do this in Windows itself without the admin password, obviously!) If you haven't put much on the machine yet that you care about losing, you might just do a complete factory recovery - I'd need to know details of the machine to advise how you'd go about this but pretty much all major OEMs ship some method of doing it these days. I highly also recommend you make a password reset disk so this doesn't happen - this option is on the sidebar in the User Accounts settings (where you'd actually go to make or change your password) and I believe it may give you a link when you actually set a password as well. 

This won't work with a stock 5770 - ANY output over two has to be active DisplayPort. Sapphire does have a variant (the FLEX series) that will accomplish this passively, but they do this by lowering one of the DVI outputs to single-link.
