Short answer: Backup your data and replace the drive as soon as possible, it is failing Long answer: Yes, you should be worried... The drive is failing, it may die as your reading this, or it could go for months or years, but it is failing 393k sectors is very excessive and the fact it is increasing means the drive is continuing to degrade. Acronis has a knowledge base article explaining what it is, or from Wikipedia's S.M.A.R.T. entry page: 

Although this is from a slightly different Asus motherboard, it should be very similar... In BIOS/EFI, go to Advanced then CPU Configuration menu, find the entry for Intel Virtualization Technology and enable it (note the scroll bars, they are tiny and easily missed), then press F10 to save and Reboot. You should no longer receive that error message and your guest machine should start normally. Most likely your BIOS was reset, I believe this is Disabled by default. 

If you have a true Bluetooth mouse, of course you connect it to a Bluetooth enabled PC with the proper drivers installed for the Bluetooth services. This is a basic function of Bluetooth and I have done it on Windows and Linux PC's. Be aware however, all cordless mice (and keyboards) are NOT Bluetooth, such as Logitech which uses it's own proprietary "Unifying" receiver. Most cordless mice are proprietary to their dongles, unless you specifically purchase one that is Bluetooth compatible. 

This is most likely a carrier issue between your modem and their DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Access Module), I would contact your ISP... PADx messages are related to PPPoE Active Discovery protocol and if it happens repeatedly (usually) it means the PPPoE connection is bouncing up and down, again this likely an issue between the modem and the carrier's equipment so I would contact them. 

Although Google would get these answers quickly, 8080 is officially recognized as HTTP Alternate of 80, essentially the same function. From Wikipedia 

Sure sounds like you have troubleshooted it down to a bad motherboard... Since the integrated graphics and the graphics card both use the PCI-E bus, it seems that there is a transport bus or chipset problem on the mainboard, neither of which you can "fix". Assuming you are reading the beep code correctly, it is unlikely this is a CPU problem. Sounds like it's time for new motherboard. Sorry. 

If your recovery environment is missing, for what ever reason, you will need to either contact your system vendor/manufacturer (such as Dell, HP, Toshiba, etc.) to acquire a copy of restoration media which is the preferred method, this may or may not reinstall your recovery environment but it will definitely allow you to re-install Windows that was originally shipped with your PC. An alternative would be to use Microsoft's Media Creation Tool although at the time of this answer attempting to download it is resulting in a 404 - Not found error, and it appears Microsoft has removed it in favor of Windows 10. Another alternative would be download and burn the full Microsoft ISO file to disk for Windows 8.1, which is available on the Microsoft Downloads site. 

Then this will not work. One can assume from that information that the ISP only allows one device (one MAC address) to be connected to the network at one time. Connecting a switch (ie. "ethernet splitter" as you called it) would result in only one of the devices working, or neither will work. The ISP may even detect an invalid configuration with multiple MAC addresses requesting service and temporarily suspend the connection entirely until the situation is rectified. The solution would be to contact the ISP and request 2 IP addresses, which would likely be public, static IP addresses and would incur an additional monthly charge and possibly a setup fee. This would then require you and your daughter to manually configure the IP address information in your routers as well as connect a small switch to split the connection. I am not familiar with Apple's Airport devices though, so there maybe some way to configure it to work behind her existing router. 

In general, you cannot. In most computers, the BIOS will disable the embedded the graphics when an expansion GPU is installed. For most PC's, the only way to use the embedded graphics is to physically remove the card from the computer. 

Upon completing these steps, you should no longer have a HWE error and should be on a current release of Linux Mint. Perform updates normally. 

2&3. The routers do not give or take Internet from either one... Router 1 is the router providing DHCP and other network services including the gateway to the Internet. The second router is essentially a switch, dumbed down to do nothing but act as a switch (and possibly an Access Point) only and perform no routing at all. Essentially it's a dumb "hub" only. 

Although your question isn't clear, I think this will likely answer your question... That BT adapter has been discontinued for a very long time, and the proprietary drivers haven't been offered for 7+ years so you must use the Microsoft BT stack. The Microsoft BT stack that is used by Windows XP only supports Bluetooth 1.1, 2.0, and 2.0 and EDR, and not 2.1 according to Microsoft's General Bluetooth support page. Also, although I cannot verify it specifically by searching, the age of that adapter suggests it only supports Bluetooth 1.0 or 2.0 even with it's proprietary drivers (assuming you can find them). In order to get Bluetooth 2.1 with EDR support, you must have at least Windows Vista and a compatible adapter. Some devices do support backwards compatibility, but since you didn't state what device you are trying/wanting to connect, I can't answer that question. 

Windows 3.1 (and WfW 3.11) do maintain an uptime counter, but it is only available by an API call so you need a program to see it. If you can get it on the machine then this will tell you what you want to know. EDIT: Apparently that one isn't the correct file, here is a different one I found that seems to be correct, the original reference I found was here. Supposedly from command prompt you can run and see the start time of the computer, but it's buried and with no command in Windows it is hard to find. 

According to Dell's spec sheet for this model, you can have up to 3 PCI-Express x16 cards in this system with up to 675 watt power draw, so adding a GTX 480 should not be difficult. Personally, I would remove any existing video card prior to installing a new one. THe GTX 480 is a rather old card for gaming, you should look into a more recent model, it is not hard to exceed the capabilities of a 6 year old card with a modern card at even a moderate price. I suggest looking at $URL$ for comparisons of video cards. 

Been a while since I have done this with *BSD systems... but here goes. According to your command, the partition's filesystem is "FreeBSD" which if correct is probably UFS, not fat, ntfs, or extX. First, make sure you have the ufs module loaded with , if it is not listed, load the module with Try to mount is a UFS filesystem 

On my son's Windows 10 Pro laptop, an HP Probook 4540s that was upgraded from a previous Windows version, it will not shutdown... The laptop starts the shutdown process with the spinning windows thingy, then the screen goes black but the power light stays on and the hard drive light flickers occasionally except it never powers down, then after about 1.5-2 minutes the desktop just pops back up (not like the computer was restarted, just pops back up) but it didn't reboot. The strange part is selecting Restart has very normal behavior, the Windows Restart screen with the spinning windows thingy pops up for about 15-20 seconds, then it shuts down and the BIOS screen pops up and it reboots normally. So on a restart the laptop is doing the shutdown process normally and restarting, but on an actual shutdown it is not getting to that point (no BIOS screen) and the desktop just reappears after a couple minutes. I have tried updating and downgrading the Intel Management Engine Interface like several online help forums mentioned, but it didn't change anything. My son is getting very frustrated since he has to hold the power button to get it to shutdown, which he knows can cause issues. Any ideas on how to fix this? 

Yes, it will conflict... The subnet mask basically tells the computer if an address is intra or inter network, but 10.0.0.2 is 10.0.0.2 whether it is a /16 or a /24. I would suggest some basic research into IP addressing to understand what these things, like subnet mask, do. Remember that the subnet mask is basically just a guide to say if something is inter or intra network, meaning (extremely simplified) the device uses the subnet mask to look at the destination IP and asks "is this in my network or subnet?" if the answer is yes, it communicates directly to that IP address, if the answer is no, then it communicates to the gateway so it can relay the communication to the IP address or more accurately to the next hop towards the destination. A different subnet mask and same IP within a single network does not make them unique.
