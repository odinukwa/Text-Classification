How long would memtest86 take on a P4 2GHz 512MB RAM? What about a Pentium M 1GHz 512MB RAM? I recently tried it on the latter, and saw it had 2 progress bars at the top one said "pass" and goes from 0% to 100%, and the one below it says Test # and runs through a number of tests, each one going from 0% to 100% I think that's how it was. So one pass included a number of tests completing. I looked at it after during 2 hours, at one point I saw the pass progress bar had gone through and gone to the start with another pass. After 2 hours, it said 4 passes 0 errors. I saw an option to press escape to exit. But it was continuing. Eventually I just exitted. Would it go on indefinitely? Just continuously doing more and more passes? Is it common for people to just do one pass? is that recommended? if not, how many are recommended? btw, what is the difference between memtest86 and memtest86+? 

I have had a cable of 30M be faulty, and a cable tester (albeit a cheap one) showed it as OK / didn't detect a fault. It may be that longer cables can be trodden on and that makes them less reliable(by damaging them). The kind of ethernet cables that I find to be reliable, have been one with a rugged jacket, they are expensive, and maybe a better quality build too. I used to get cables from a company that specialised in cables, but I just found them bad quality! But when I got a few rugged cables (and it would have been a specialist company making them), I found those were very reliable. So, maybe as a rule of thumb to get a quality cable, you could look for rugged jacket ones from a company that makes the rugged jacket ones, if you're willing to pay the price for such cables. 

No, because your ISP's gateway is pretty much a next stop. I don't know why it has to be, but it is. To get to the other sites, you could try a web proxy website, if you can get to one of those sites then they may be able to get to the site you want, just taking another route. Bear in mind that it's not safe to enter passwords if going through a web proxy website though. 

ipconfig /release is not working, why is that? here is a sequence where I put my cable in get an IP, try ipconfig /release and it tells me it can't release wireless, but there is no wireless connection. i'm just trying to release the wired one. unplug cable 

Image it. e.g. Macrium Reflect is free(as in no cost) software that lets you make an image of a partition or I suppose of a disk. I haven't tried this but you could try disk2vhd, and then load the vhd in a virtual machine. $URL$ I once ran chkdsk /r while a drive was failing and it failed -while- running chkdsk - click of death. That was a once in a million bad luck. But making an image would involve no writing. And from there you could run chkdsk. I once heard also that is what hard drive repair places do, because any work on a hard drive could cause it to fail. Perhaps if there's just some files to copy you could just copy those. But if more than that then image it. 

I spoke to a guy that knows something about ffmpeg. They said don't use -c copy. I see that -acodec copy and -vcodec copy, are just as bad or the same. And I shouldn't use them for this snipping of video. The video was MP4 container, AVC video, AAC Audio. He also said that the start or end time isn't falling on an I-Frame so you get the nearest one, which can be quite far away from the desired location, and he thought maybe there is some I-frames only AVC profile. But he said the problem was that I was doing '-c copy' or -vcodec copy. And I shouldn't do copy. So I tried a -vcodec and -acodec that I had noted down as good for mp4s.. And I applied them to the command 

The diskpart in recovery console doesn't allow you to make a partition active(bootable). Use Gparted Live. $URL$ "On the Recovery Console, which is included in all Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, there is a diskpart command which is significantly different from the one included in the actual operating system. It only provides functionality for adding and deleting partitions, but not for setting an active partition. The utility is also provided in the Windows Recovery Environment, the successor of the original Recovery Console" 

If I want to scan a document, 10 pages, each page as PDF 300dpi, greyscale. 10 pages 6MB.. 40 pages 24MB. FINE. Color, each page is 25MB Why is color 25MB? Is PDF very inefficient? it does the text and images. But a far bigger question, And far crazier than that.. I scan in 10 pages into a document. It takes up 1GB in my TEMP folder. ONE GIGABYTE!!!! It processes it then the 1GB is freed up. But why the heck as much as 1GB during processing!! For a 6MB document! I think it was here C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Temp\MaglevExpressTemp Software is HP Solution Center. Does other software take up that much space? is some worse than others? Should I not be using HP solution center, for my HP Scanner? 

Sounds perhaps not quite but a little bit like what would happen if forgetting to plug the 2x2 cable into the motherboard. I think I had it with the P4.. an old system.. probably your system is more modern and perhaps only the motherboards for the p4, that needed it, but anyhow, if your motherboard has that socket, then plug it in.. I think in the p4 case perhaps it always did the few seconds thing. didn't need to unplug it and plug it back in for it. so perhaps not quite the same symptoms. Also take the motherboard out of the case and try And remove screws from it.. (I did once have a weird MBRD that didn't power up at all 'cos one screw in a hole designed for a screw, but not meant to take it.. shorted it. was strange. I don't think your case.. but worth trying to take the MBRD out of the case) And do try another PSU. that's an obvious thing to try. 

I'm going to take a risk here and say.. Yes you can. In the same sense that you can telnet to a hostname. Some people are saying you can't 'cos one says "Telnet is a Layer 3 network protocol. " I don't think that's correct, for one thing, telnet is an application layer protocol, that's layer 7. IP or IPX or whatever else, is the layer 3 network layer protocol. But that's not even relevant. The whole layer concept is not useful here. It's used to identify different headers, and to identify which bunches of headers are stripped off and added(encapsulation). The "packet" and by that I mean the whole lot(not just the layer 3). But looking at the whole thing all the fields. There's an IP address and a MAC address. You have to know a lot of things to get the packet sent. The application layer protocol(telnet), the TCP port, the IP address. In theory, you can telnet to a host given a MAC address, by getting the IP address. Just as you can telnet to a host given a hostname (you'd take the hostname and get the ip address). And just as you can get an IP from a hostname, one can also(though in a different way) get the IP given a MAC address. RARP $URL$ it's apparently allegedly obsolete now(according to the first line of that wikipedia article) though I see the arp command on windows 7 and no doubt ARP is still used. RARP goes MAC->IP (getting IP from a MAC address). As opposed to ARP which goes IP->MAC (getting MAC address from IP). Just as you have DNS and rDNS.. that get you between IP addresses and hostnames. So too ARP and RARP get you between IP addresses and MAC addresses. So just as you can telnet to a hostname, you can with a similar principle, in theory, telnet to a host with a MAC address. Maybe that program you mention (mactelnet) does that. ADDED I haven't got telnet on this machine but here's an example with a script 

Here's a different route to your problem. I suppose it should solve it. How about playing it in whatever proprietary software it uses, and recording what comes out the speakers(windows lets you do that). Open volume control, go to options..properties..recording... choose stereo mix and mono mix ok, then tick one of those. now open a program like start..run..sndrec32 or something more flashy, and press record and play the cd. 

And character map I can choose Segoe UI Symbol but it doesn't display that codepoint. The last one it shows is U+FFFD but it stops there, which would of course is before U+1F381 

You see four highlighted sets of characters. The first one is hebrew then english, in left to right mode. (LTR mode) The second third and fourth, are english then hebrew, in right to left mode. (RTL mode) I'm using ctrl with left shift to go to LTR mode, and ctrl with right shift to switch to RTL mode. The hebrew letters are e.g. unicode but any will do. Here is the find and replace 

How about going to the end of where the hyperlink is and pressing backdelete, to remove the link aspect of it Another way is copy/paste the link into notepad then back into msword. Then don't push ENTER after it. If you want a new line or more after it, and you don't already have them, then make the new lines before you paste the link in. So the link is there but it comes out as plain text and you have new lines after it if need be. So, when a link is there, you make sure it doesn't go blue and start looking like a link detected by Ms Word, otherwise if it is clicked it will open. I've tested it in Word 2003. 

Obviously if a "network card" is bad and you insert a new network card in its place, then that's going to fix it isn't it. Though since your network interface is not on a card(it's integrated as you say), so inserting a new card won't fix that one but it will work around the problem by giving you a new way to connect, and makes having one bad network interface into a non-issue. And not only will a USB network adaptor or any network adaptor, not be affected by some other network interface being bad, it is actually a good workaround to the problem. Just as inserting a new card would be a good workaround to the problem 

I've tried format..more columns, it was on one column, and I clicked ok too. Still the tables show side by side. I'm curious how they got like that. 

Babelmap is interesting because it can show characters past FFFF (not necessary in this case), and also it can show what fonts on your system have a particular unicode character. But to see what font is actually used in practice by notepad, as a fallback font, you need to check that GlobalUserInterface.CompositeFont file. Then look in charmap or babelmap for the first font with the glyph/unicode character that you want. Babelmap has composite fonts but I think they are custom ones not specifically the custom one used by windows. But one could usefully use babelmap to search for which font has a unicode character, or to look at what characters are within a font, even beyond FFFF. 

All the information about who owns what IP who it's registered to, is stored in databases. IANA assign the IPs to RIRs(regional internet registrars), there's one called ARIN covers america, one called RIPE covers europe.. one for africa e.t.c. they each have databases. Any website or command or GUI that looks up the IP and gets information about ownership, does a whois, on the database of one of those RIRs. If you want details of how to access a RIR's database as a programmer, then stackoverflow would be a better place to ask. But as far as the methodology.. no complex algorithm, just returning information from a (RIR's) database. 

You're right to act as soon as it starts, but don't just hit a key. You have to mouse click to enter the VM, and then hit the key (F2 for BIOS or ESC for boot menu) F12 for network boot though I haven't used network boot. When the virtual machine starts, the mouse cursor changes from an arrow to a hand cursor, but you are not in the virtual machine unless you click, and then the cursor will disappear. Then, it will respond to key presses. You can also edit the vmx file of the virtual machine, and add the line (15000 milliseconds is 15 seconds but you can change it to whatever) and you get another screen that offers the same keys and a 15 second delay to hit them. Of course, you have to click first. You might want to shorten it from 15 seconds. But if you've been missing it you might appreciate the screen being there for 15 seconds, then change it once you've figured out how to do it. When practicing you might want to shutdown and power up, rather than restart, so it's a bit clearer when it is powering up, though restarting is OK. Another option is "power on to firmware", try it, it goes to the BIOS. It's in the menu when right clicking a VM, or in the VM menu at the top. And in some versions of vmware workstation it's "power on to BIOS". In my version it's "power on to firmware" but it goes to the BIOS Oddly, while in an ubuntu VM, F2 and ESC don't bring up the BIOS, choosing "power on to firmware" does. (or "power on to bios" in other VMware workstation versions). Added jamesdlin points out in comment "Power on to firmware" is the new name for "Power on to BIOS" since some VMs now use EFI instead of BIOS. BIOS is a type of firmware. 

Laptops tend to have small cpu fans. alternatively, there is this option(I see it titled mini vacuum air extracting usb case cooler cooling fan). Looks like it goes adjacent to the vent. But since you have just a motherboard you could blow it elsewhere. Just onto the hot part. If there's a metal plate over the CPU that takes heat, then you would blow onto that. I'm not sure how you'd do that with a blower on the side - maybe build a tube to redirect the air (let me know what you'd use to do that if you do). Assuming the CPU is on the bottom of the motherboard, you could raise the laptop a bit and blow the air under it from the side that may do it. Or, use a fan below it as you seem to plan to do. You can also get a more typical laptop cooler, a laptop cooling pad, some have a big fan like 14cm.. pluscom do a 14cm one and they do a 12cm one.. The description says Aluminum USB Notebook / Laptop Cooler 12cm Fan with speed control Switch & 2 USB ports So, it is able to get its power from 2 USB ports. You can get ones with 3 small fans too. All USB powered no ACDC adaptor.
