I am not able to ping the inside subinterface on my ASA 5508-x. When setup this way, I am able to ping the interface: 

(i.e. GigabitEthernet0/2) is not setup as a VLAN and has an IP of (example) 1.1.1.2, I can ping this interface directly as long as I'm sourcing from the inside (and, of course, on the subnet). However, if I were to setup a subinterface as the inside: 

I've configured the ASA for LDAP authentication and successfully tested with the "Test aaa-server" command. However when I attempt to connect via Clientless VPN, I am unable to log in. Local users are able to log in via Clientless VPN. I am truly unsure how I would even begin to troubleshoot this issue. Edit: Redacted some non-essential information (reason being that the test aaa-server test tools verifies that the aaa server is authenticating correctly, AKA everything on the inside is working as intended. Correct me if I'm wrong.) 

Specifically, I get "Destination host unreachable." Is this a routing problem? Edit: Here is the config for the port on the switch connecting to the ASA. 

I would no longer be able to ping this address because it is treated as cross-interface pinging. I found this and confirmed with a Cisco rep. Apologies for the vague answer to begin with. 

Alright, I'm not going to bore people w/ subnet math and powers of two. But since we're in the IPv4 exhaustion mode, it allows us to better utilize our given subnet assignments. Also, in a P2P I see no reason why we need a broadcast address. There are only two hosts in this network. Therefore, any packets destined for broadcast are going to be heard by the other host. BTW, Cisco routers have supported this feature since IOS 12.2(2)T 

It sounds to me that the 802.1x credentials are taking too long to process and re-authenticate to the roamed AP. This would stop the data flow and have packets destined to the wrong AP until the credentials are processed. Once the credentials are processed, the new ARP entry is sent out via AP and the switch then learns where to send the data for that MAC/IP. If you're hoping to get better roaming results. I strongly recommend buying a controller. Perhaps you decided to forgo that cost since it can be expensive, especially if you only have 2 or 3 APs in the area. But a WLC 2504 is fairly cheap it offers similar features to the larger 5508s and etc. Some features include centralized management, RRM, Cisco Clean Air (whether you believe this really helps or not), and Layer 2 or Layer 3 roaming capabilities. The newer 7.4 code also includes 802.11r and 802.11k extensions for faster and more controlled device-AP roaming. 

After some research I discovered the ASA does not allow pinging from one interface to another. So this explains why I was able to ping the inside interface when it was setup on the physical port but not when it was setup as the VLAN. Edit: I'll elaborate. If my inside interface: 

I have tried to configure it as a switchport with access to Vlan10. Open to trying to configure it again if necessary. Edit: Discovered that you cannot ping from one interface from another on the ASA. Subinterfaces are treated as separate interfaces so this explains why I could not ping once I configured the inside interface as a subinterface. 

We recently installed a Cisco ASA 5508-x with FirePOWER Services. I am now getting around to setting FP up. I would like to understand how FP works before configuration. In terms of exposure, how does the FPmodule handle traffic. Let's say the module is in "Inline" mode. From my understanding, all traffic enters and exits through the module before heading to its destination. So let's say, for example, the module has an internal IP (it is my understanding the module must be on the same VLAN as the inside interface). Traffic comes in and goes to the FP module. Am I exposing my internal network by having the module on an internal VLAN? Or does the traffic have to properly pass ACL rules to GET to the module. Because I'm not exactly an expert on this stuff (obviously), maybe I can try to explain it like this. Cable-wise, traffic comes in through the inside interface. With FP services, does traffic come through the inside interface, get redirected to the FP module, inspected, then redirected back to its original destination? What about traffic going out? Does it hit the inside interface, get redirected to the module, then back to the inside interface? I realize these are a lot of probably dumb questions, but I'm trying to get answers so I can explain them to my manager. 

This is more of a cosmetic issue however it does bug me.... I removed the sub-interfaces off a 3845 router by issuing. 

I've kept digging around the internet....and I think I've answered my own question. Now I need to go back to the application/device owners/developers and see what we can do or further lock these devices down to their own VLAN. Please leave comments or answers with any further advice. RFC 4541 2.1.2: 1) Packets with a destination IP address outside 224.0.0.X which are not IGMP should be forwarded according to group-based port membership tables and must also be forwarded on router ports. 

Just wanted to note about the 2x ASA 5520's that I have. The original sticks inside the 5520s were OEM RAM. One set had the model/part-no cis00-21077-508mg on it. (PC2700 ECC) The other was OEM Micron memory mt8vddt6464ay-40bf4 (PC3200 ECC CL3) As these firewalls are more for testing and lab use now so we chose to take the risk with non ECC memory in order to save money. We found some old server RAM in the warehouse and upgraded each firewall with 4x 512Mb PC2700 non-ECC sticks. Both firewalls booted up fine and have been upgraded to the latest 8.4(6) ASA code. So far they have ran without problems. 

A trunk port is generally only used when you want to interconnect two switches together in order to pass multiple VLANs between the two switches. In this example, the switches will use Dot1Q tagging and allow vlans 10, 20 & 30 to be passed between the two switches. Vlan 10 however, will be passed without tagging since it is set as the native vlan. eg)
