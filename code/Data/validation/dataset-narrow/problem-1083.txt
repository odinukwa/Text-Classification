I would not use here as it only allows for an exact match. A simple but effective workaround would be using a comment (or empty) along with a regex to look for to replace: 

It would not address the protocol-specific issues of GPRS, though. I would not use VPN links with enabled compression - it likely will not help your problem since the transmitted data is compressed already most of the time: most webmasters are using GZIP compression for HTML and CSS and image data is compressed as well and cannot meaningfully be re-compressed with lossless methods - i.e. without resizing and/or transcoding. 

None except from switching it off and not using it for the said number of weeks. If it's broken, it might break even more and take the data with it. 

You can't. SMART is guessing, it can't be sure of anything. There has been a research at Google concerning HDD failures with a rather fuzzy result about SMART predictions: 

As a more generic (or scriptable) way to do this, you could employ which does print a section with a list of hotfixes installed: 

Your device has irrecoverably lost a smaller amount of data. Statistically, it is likely that more is to follow. You also are at a greater risk of losing the entire drive ("greater" as in "a higher probability than a comparable drive population without bad sectors would expose"). 

This will keep full resolution (defined as seconds per interval in the of the plugin config) for 1 day, scale down to 10-second consolidations for 1 week, further reducing the resolution to 1 minute for 1 month and 5 minutes for 1 year. Caveat: is only honored when actually building the RRD anew. If you already have the RRD built, mounting into the plugin's config output will not do anything unless you delete the RRD and plugin state data at the server. 

If you would like the logical partition order to reflect their "physical" location on the disk, can help as well. Just press "x" to activate extended functionality and use the f ix partition order function. You might need to adjust your s for Linux systems after that - Windows has GUID-based partition identification and should not care about the order. 

Check the event log to see if your system has kicked one of the remaining apparently functional drives out of the array before. Now if you are confident that the two remaining disks should contain all (or at least most) of your data, you might try your luck with data recovery tools (at least some do claim capability to find and re-assemble lost arrays). Alternatively, if you have spare disks you can copy the raw data to and are willing to experiment, you might check out if your array would assemble using a Linux Live CD and either or . 

I always wondered how well the computer components can handle sudden power outages due to janitor accidentally pulling the power cord, whole city block power outage or power generator failure. Are components tested specifically for safe shutdown during production because of how common these issues are, or does it all just happen not to break most of the time because of how electric devices are generally designed to be? 

By default, in Windows 7 start menu the item "Documents" opens a library containing current user's documents folder and public documents. I'd like to change that behavior to open current user's documents folder. How do I do that? 

I prefer disabled font anti-aliasing on my desktop, but some websites use custom fonts that look absolutely horrible without anti-aliasing. I could disable custom fonts completely from Firefox font options, but it'd be better if there was a way to create a list of fonts that are ok to smooth (or better a list of fonts that should not be smoothed and allow all others). Is there a way to (not) smooth specified fonts in Firefox? 

I haven't figured out how to prevent the scrolls from affecting the note page itself. If someone finds a way to block the scroll event from reaching the main note area from within the notes list area, please share your solution so we could combine the scripts for best results. 

I've noticed that my display with HDMI input shows a very slight, just barely visible pattern on dark colors. Sometimes it's vertical lines, sometimes it's a plaid-like square pattern, sometimes it's like random noise. But these patterns don't animate like noise on a TV, they're static as long as the image is static. I tried playing around in Photoshop with 1 bit changes in colors and I managed to produce different patterns. It's very hard to make a good photo of, but here's the test pattern image: 

Patterns change around between the same cells in other quadrants due to 1 bit color change (slightly red/green/blue). I didn't notice such a pattern going on my older d-sub display (if I'm not mistaken that was analog type video signal instead of digital). Is this some HDMI signal side-effect? Or is the display causing this? Or is this my graphics card? I don't have another comparable display to test this out on. 

In Windows 7, after the OS detects it was shutdown in unusual manner (due to BSOD or power outage) upon logging in, it shows a corresponding dialog with a "Check online for a solution to this problem" button. After you press that button, it will look like this for some time, and then it disappears: 

You are looking for the plugin config directive, it is hinting at the resolution steps to build the RRD with: 

You are likely suffering from the Force Unit Access type for your write operations. While it is meant to maintain durability for all writes, there might be regressions especially with NVMe drives and certain device / firmware / driver combinations. The PCMark FAQ is describing something very similar: 

As always with caching questions, the answer would be "it entirely depends on your workload". The cache is only of any use if your running processes are spending a significant amount of time accessing memory and exhibit a noticeable locality of reference for memory addressing (and are not happy with the smaller L1/L2 caches present per core for this matter). Having a high number of processes running within different threads increases the odds for thrashing of the shared cache and thus diminishes performance gains which possibly would have been achieved otherwise. This is also the reason for increasing the cache size with an increased core count - the more memory-competing threads you have running, the larger your shared cache likely needs to be in order to be useful at all. There is an oldish article from Tom's Hardware comparing two old P4 chips with and without L3 cache for a number of rendering / graphical workloads. The numbers are rubbish, as is the whole benchmark, but it contains a nice explanation of the caching architecture in general and L3 caching in particular. The bottom line: you likely would not notice the difference, but if you need the exact numbers, you would have to purchase both CPUs and run your workload on both of them to compare runtimes. 

As long as you are not root, you simply could revoke the write permission for the ~/nas directory for yourself and use sudo for elevated mounting: 

Since it is a redirection and not a mis-resolution, the most plausible explanation is that the communication partner of your Windows client is simply sending an appropriate response to redirect to localhost. You should check the response headers and the response content with either a packet sniffer like Wireshark or using a Browser Add-on like ieHTTPHeaders for Internet Explorer or Live HTTP Headers for Firefox. You could add the results to your question for a further analysis. The communication partner is not necessarily news.yahoo.com (although it is possible that something at Yahoo is/was temporarily broken), but might also be an explicitly set or transparent HTTP proxy. Another thing to test would be simply using another browser - Internet Explorer (or rather the underlying API) does have a number of hooks which would allow an alteration of the browser's behavior - some malware programs are known to exploit this. 

My problem resolved when I simply went to uninstall programs in Windows 10 control panel and unistalled that seemed "baidu something" it was mostly in chinese so I don't know even how it's called. 

So there are many names by wich Drop-down list may appear in bug reports or in help documentation. This makes it harder to search for a particular bug for this element. I need to know if Linux follows a standard naming convention, or at least if the desktop environment Gnome follows one (the one wich I'm having problems with). 

Suppose I click "sleep" to windows 10, I'm wondering for example, suppose these programs were busy at the moment of sleep, for example: *Google drive uploading a recently locally edited file. *a program running a process, such as a program calculating PI, or a video editor rendering. What happens to this processes? Do they have to finish before sleeping? Do all the information saved to start from the same point when awake? Do they have to get killed before sleeping? 

So I need to know if there are standard names of widgets (graphical control elements). For example the wikipedia article for Drop-down list reads: 

Here are picture of the screen take with a external camera (since screenshot is disabled by default for UAC for security reasons, but this is not important at all), here are two pictures of the exact same window in case you can't see the full window. , . Note: In the pictures there is not shown that there are two users to choose from, me and another. I think the other is the one that came with the computer by default, and Pedro is me the one who created the profile "pedro". I haven't tried with the other user actually, I will try. But normally my user has had no problems like this with other UAC before, so it doesn't make sense, also my user has root. This is a recurrent UAC, it appears every 5 minutes (!!!) driving me insane. I put the correct password giving administrative rights to the program, but still, five minutes later, needs authorization again. I tried accepting and refusing, also I 100% sure the password I insert when accepting is correct. How to stop this nonsense? My pc is Lenovo with Windows 10. Edit: In response to a helpful request, more pictures when I click show details. When clicking show certificate, it shows a valid certificate, it doesn't matter too see it. 

I heard that dual-cpu motherboards are quite expensive and not all cpus can work in dual-cpu mode, but I don't know much else. Does it make sense to spend money on a desktop computer with 2 processors, or is it more appropriate to buy 1 powerful modern cpu and an ordinary motherboard? I'm a gamer and a game developer, and I like my PCs fast, but I don't know which option here is faster, and what is the difference in costs. I'm not asking for shopping recommendation, but approximate price/performance numbers would be nice. 

I like listening to music, but the one thing I can't get with the mobile devices (players, smartphones, notebooks) is the volume and clarity I get from my desktop pc audio card. It's nothing special, the cheapest PCI-E x1 Sound Blaster card, but somehow it sounds a lot better. I have tried listening to external audio cards and their sound is comparable, but they are a lot more expensive, to the point that I can't really think of it as a great value. So I'd like to try and find a way to make internal PCI-E audio cards mobile. Does there exist a common method to mobilize internal PCI-E devices? Perhaps some controller with only the required interfaces and power cables? If not, what does it take to turn a PCI-E audio card into USB-powered mobile version? Again, I'm looking for reasonably prices solutions, but if there are only the expensive ways, I'd still like to know about them. 

As you can see, my voice calls use a total of ~9700 bytes per second (~3500 B/s upload, ~6200 B/s download). 

The total number of cores in both configs is 8 and that's twice as many as in the base config, so my guess is their performance is supposed to be 200% of base config, but then I'm not knowledgeable enough in this area to make a decent guess. Price is not my concern in this question, I just want to know how the performance changes if the total cpu core number increase is done within and outside a single processor. My personal interest lies in gaming and game development. I don't know about other games, but my own games I try to make multithreaded, so they could take advantage of all those cpu cores on my pc. 

Not sure about other versions, but in Windows 7 you can simply create a shortcut in your user folder (for example, ) and name it whatever you want. You can then press Start with your mouse or hit Winkey and type its name to start the linked application quickly. You can add custom launch parameters in that link if you want. Also the link stays in your user folder and this means other users won't be bothered by its existence, in case they want different things to run after typing the same short name. If for some reason the search function is disabled on your Windows and you don't have the search bar in Start menu (maybe because of some silly corporate policies) you can still launch that app but through the Run window, which is called by the key combo WinKey+R, type the name there and hit Enter. This is my preferred way because it doesn't take even that part-second to "find" the app link through the search bar.
