This question is similar to Can I prove that an SSD is broken? But the answers there are from 2013. We have seen several generations of flash technologies since then. - Also, while they suggest , I am missing a discussion on weather this is a good idea at all. Ultimatley, some flash memories do not like it to be written to a 100%. Also, how do we tell the SSD afterwards which sectors are free (again)? How to fix bad blocks on SSD is also not satisfying. How safe is it to run CHKDSK on an SSD? discusses only the impact of I could not find other resources that deal with this problem. 

This is obviously a firewall problem. Check the firewall on your virtual machine guest and make sure it allows ping and SMB shares. Check the firewall of your virtual machine host and make sure it allows everything you need. Check also that the host does the routing well. Do you use a host-based NAT with port forwarding? Then you need to add forwarding rules for SMB. Check the middleboxes of your network and make sure they do not block SMB. Some routers do block it as default. 

Obviously some process is still running and providing FTP functionality. Have a look at which process uses the FTP port (Port 21) with . If vsftpd is still using it then have a look at the vsftpd log files. (the service command just runs a bash script which is supposed to stop the service - it could fail to do so) 

From the line it is hard to say that you have two processors. Simple version to find out: open it up and look if you have two processors. If this line is from windows then you (most probably) have only one processor. Intel provied a nice explanation why there are two frequencies shown: $URL$ (short story: the first is part of the name, the second is determined by Windows) To get details about your CPU I reccomend CPU-Z. 

I want to log every operation of root on my server. This is useful for debugging, or for setting up another identical server, and so on. I am searching for a solution for either centos or debian. Preferably one that works on both. It sould also cover every operation done via sudo. What nearly fulfills my requirements is the logging function of PuTTY. The drawbacks are: it is saved on the client (should be on the server, since the clients may vary). Multiple ssh sessions are not well supported. Other ideas I looked into: .bash_history is another idea. But it misses a time stamp and chronology is not maintained if multiple sessions are used. If a file is changed then only the command (e.g., ) is visible, bot not what has been changed. psacct or acct have timestamps, but changes to files are still not visible. If I understood auditd correctly, you need to specify what should be monitored. But I want to monitor everything (e.g., package installations, config file changes, etc) 

If I understand your problem, you have a large partition and want to re-partition the space it occupies into two or more partitions. Example: you have a 100 GB partition and want to split it up into a 60 GB and a 40 GB partition. The important question is, how much data is used right now (how full is your partition right now?). If you use more then 60 GB, you need to use an external drive to temporarily store your data. If you use less, you can do it. There are many tools that can do this, I made good experience with Partition Master. The free version is good enough. Just select resize, and set it to 60 GB and thats it. If necessary, the tool will copy some files around (the ones that are in places where the other partition will be). After the resize is done, you have 40 GB of free space that you can re-partition. 

No, the 32bit version will work as well. Performance might be different, and if you have more than 4 GB of RAM you can not use them with 32bit Windows. 

To find similar sentences you would need something like a word-stemming program or some kind of fuzzy-search. 

This might work, but I would not try that. The important part is the L in DDR3L of the modules you want to use. This is low-voltage RAM which uses 1.35V, while your PC provides 1.5V. Also DDR3L RAM is (usually) more expensive than DDR3 RAM, so just use normal DDR3 modules. Apart from that, the frequency is not a problem. So, if your PC supports only 1333MHz you can use 1600MHz modules (which will run at 1333Hz). So you might spend to much money on modules which are faster than what your PC can utilize, but sometimes faster modules are cheaper. 

Within the I assume you have content that should appear on click ... and then there is the "final content". This "final content" is the content that appears/starts to animate on click and after the animation is finished the next slide should appear. Solution 

He only needs a special server which is configured to save all requests. DNS encoded leaking An attacker could use DNS to leak information. By using any program on your computer that has internet access. Just make the program try to contact an address like this: 

So, you want to prevent information from within your network being transferred to outside of your network (i.e., to the Internet)? If a PC can access the Internet from within your network (e.g., if it can browse the web), then preventing information leaking to the Internet is close to impossible. Let me give you some examples of how data could be leaked: E-Mail & Uploading This is what you are trying to prevent. It might be possible to prevent this, but useless as there are so many other ways. URL encoded leaking An attacker could use any browser to access URLs in a form like this: 

If your only concern is fonts, then the result depends on how Word will replace a missing font. This is hard to predict, because people might have other fonts installed; they might even have a font called Liberation which is completely different. This article shows how to control font replacement in Word: $URL$ 

Is there a solution? yes there is. Should you do it that way? Definitely not. If I got you right, you have this setup (for the sake of simplicity only with one access point) 

The question is now: Is this a safe and secure method? Or is there any way to gain access to sub2.example.com without knowing a correct username/password? (It is safe to assume that there will be no file present or at least it will not overwrite the authentication part.) I know that it would be much simpler to use , but this is not allowed in .htaccess but only in the apache conf, which I am not allowed to edit. 

I want to create a RAID (actually a zfs raidz) with disks from different manufactures. The disks will be roughly the same, e.g., SATA, 3 TB, 7200 rpm. Since the disks will probably have small differences in size (several MB probably) the RAID creation will fail if not all partitions are the same size. I am willing to waste some MB (or even GB) at the end of each disk. The question is: how big should I size my zfs partition on each disk? Looking at the current disks is not enough, since a disk migh fail and the replacement might be different. So, which safe margin is enough? Are all 3 TB (or x TB) disks out there guaranteed to have at least x Byte of size? Is it safe to assume that a disk labeld with x TB provides at least x * 1000^4 Byte of storage? I know about the performance inpact of mixing different drives. Since the project is more about storing data the performance of the weakest disk is more than enough. 

There are various tutorials on how to do this. You should look out for tutorials concerned with virtual machines (because there you also want to save RAM and HDD space). Also, tutorials that deal with Netbooks or small SSDs are usefull. There is also a nice GUI to create a shrinked installation medium: $URL$ A nice tutorial is this one: $URL$ Other tools are: 

For most (if not all) real-world scenarios he answer is C: 1022 addresses. In theory you could use all 1024 addresses. But RFC 919 explains why you should reserve two addresses for special purposes: broadcast to all hosts and addressing the network itself. You could choose any two addresses to be these special addresses, but If different IP implementations are to be compatible, there must be a distinguished number to denote "all hosts". (RFC 919, section 7). The RFC concludes with this nice summary: 

I want to create a zfs raidz2 with 4 disks. I know this will "waste" at least 50% of the space but I aim at a high tolerance against disk failures. Using 5 disks for raidz2 is not recommended and 6 disks is to expensive and unnecessary for me. I will have 3 TB (or maybe 4 TB) disks which all have 4k sectors with 512 byte emulation. I have read many things about zfs and raidz2 and I am starting to get confused. Should I partition the disks? I read that it is a good idea to create partitions in order to make the OS aware that the disk is not empty. The partitioning can also help to align to 4k sectors. GPT or MBR? As far as I understood GPT is a must for 3 TB disks (and larger). How should I create the partition? Will this give me a correctly aligned partitions? 

Since you want encryption for your cloud-stored files you could also use EncFS. It encrypts every file separately and stores it in a folder of your choice. I have succesfully used it together with OneDrive, Dropbox and Wuala. With EncFS you get an unencrypted view of your files as a Drive (in Windows) or a FUSE mount (in Linux). The encryption/decryption is done transparently. Each of your files or folders results in an encrypted file or folder. (You can set that the file and folder names are also encrypted) There is also a Windows version and several Android versions. 

This will lead to a DNS request from your PC to the DNS server. The request is then forwarded to the DNS server of . So the attacker only needs a modified DNS server that logs the requests it got. Encoding Data in Request Patterns The attacker would need more than one domain/address. In order to leak information it could use the access pattern to these domains. For example to leak the word "hello" he could use a simple browser and access the domains he controls in a specific order: 

Wireless clients (lets call them guests) will connect to your wireless router (B). The guests will need the IP-settings (IP, GW, DNS server, etc). If you aim for security, router B is probably the right point to do this. (You probably also want to make sure that B does not act as a DHCP server on the LAN side) Now you want to configure B in such a way that your proxy computer (P) is reachable by the guests. You could do this by giving P an IP from the same subnet as the guests. (but there are other ways too). You also want to make sure that guests can only communicate with P and nothing else. Depending on your router B, this might be trivial/easy/difficult/impossible. 

I want to use iperf3 to test some QoS settings of a router. Therefore I want to simulate a lone-lasting but low bandwidth connection.* I tried the following: 

Background I powered up a VM and did some analysis of the and found: VDH looks at the registry for this key: 

Seems to me like windows restored the correct MBR to the wrong device (i.e., your USB stick). I would go ahead an use a different tool to restore your MBR. There are a lot of bootable ISOs out there. For convenience I would recommend you take something like UNetbootin or YUMI and choose one (or more) of the recovery images they offer. I would suggest a simple Linux ISO (like Xubuntu) but depending on your experience you might want to use something else. You should use another USB stick - not the one with the Win7 on it. What should probably work is to copy the MBR from the Win7 USB-Stick to your HDD. Final reminder: BACKUP! Since you can boot into your Windows: do a backup of all your (important) data as long as you can. Maybe the reason why your MBR broke in the first place is that your disk is about to fail (or maybe just bad luck). To be sure: do a backup! 

A HDD only detects faulty sectors when it tries to read from it but fails. Then it adds the sector to the . Which will reallocate it to somewhere else as soon as you try to write to this sector the next time. () Why did the read fail? Either the writing failed (and was not noticed since HDDs just write and assume it was successful) or the reading simply does not work for whatever reasons. The thing is, to be sure that your HDD is okay you need to write to every sector and then read every sector. If after reading every sector the has increased, you know that something is still broken. I would suggest a tool like $URL$ Use it to write and read every sector (preferably several times) to ensure your drive is okay (i.e., the yellow values do not change). Also the should be zero. 

This is certainly possible with PowerPoint 2010 (probably also with other versions, but I only have 2010). If I understood you correctly you want this 

It means you have to stop and wait for the green man before you can cross the street. Just kidding. It means that "Service by an authorized SHARP service technician is required." Have a look at page 62 of the manual: $URL$ 

Since you already have the command which files to keep, you can combine this with the move command . Just move them to another folder (ore give them another prefix), delete the remaining files and move them back. Take a look at the parameter of . You can use this to specify the destination and then pipe multiple files to mv. 

SSHD optimize on block-level which blocks to store on the SSD part. Blocks that are accessed often are stored there. Full disk encryption like TrueCrypt or dm-crypt use block-based encryption. Therefore there is a direct mapping between physical blocks and logical blocks (although they do not need to be the same size. So the mapping could be x physical blocks to y logical blocks). So if you access a certain file often, you also access the same physical block often and the SSHD can optimize. So using an SSHD together with encryption should not change anything. (If there are SSHD that require a driver to interact with the OS, things could change. The WD-Black² is such a drive, but the WD Black² does not transparently make use of the SSD part.) 

I have a CentOS 7 VM running on Hyper-v (fresh installation). I assigned it a dynamic memory of 256 to 2048 MB (The boot RAM is set to 512 MB). . After boot the memory footprint is quite low, but grows steadily to the 2 GB limit. When I look at the memory within the VM, most of it is free. Why? How can I make CentOS work with the dynamic RAM? The Hyper-V-Manager shows me that 1594 MB are needed by the VM and that 1898 MB are assigned to the VM. I understand why it assigns more than needed (because it is set to 20%), but why does it think that the VM needs 1594 when it actually uses only ~600 MB? The VM is a CentOS 7 minimal/console-only installation. Here some information on the VM: 

One can use yum-cron to keep CentOS up-to-date. (As explained here: $URL$ ) For various reasons it might be undesirable to have automatic feature upgrades. Therefore yum-cron also alows for a setting which will execute . My question is now: Will this give me 100% security? What I mean is, 100% of the available security patches. Or to put it the other way round: Could there by security updates which would install but would not? Obviously, any software could contain security issues which are not patched (yet) or not available as package update. These kind of problems are out of scope here. 

Short answer: no The Cisco device itself does not have PoE ports. Of course you could use a PoE capable switch or a PoE injector to power your access points and connect them to the Cisco router. 

From what you describe, the first drive is defective. and are non-zero. Re-allocating sectors is exactly what happens when the drive can not read a sector. It will then re-allocate this sector on the next write operation. You can do several things to confirm this diagnosis: Simple but uncertain: use a tool like HDD Scan to scan your disk, i.e., read every sector from your disk. You can also do this operation on your RAID 1 array. But than it is up to the RAID-firmware to decide if it will read the data from disk 1 oder disk 2. Therefore this method will not check every sector on both disks. But if disk 1 is about to fail, it is quite probable (but not guaranteed), that its SMART values will worsen. Keep an eye on , and . If these values go up, your drive is likely to fail soon. Complicated but gives more certainty:
