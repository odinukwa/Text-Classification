Short answer There is currently no easy way to get a recent Chromium build on the rpib+. Options If you just want chromecast you could try some projects that don't use Chromium because the rpib+ is RAM limited (limiting Chromium functionality) and has a less popular CPU architecture (limiting your install options). If you really want a recent version of Chromium you need to find a package compiled for your CPU architecture or build it yourself. Note that Chromium builds often lack a lot of features available in Google Chrome (webRTC, pdf viewing, etc). It appears the distributions of popular branches of linux available for the rpib+ do not have what you are looking for, but you can check all the options here. Raspbian/Debian Looking at the URL in 

If you have installed any applications that use Java (libre office, web browser, eclipse etc) you will have the setting tools for Java (which is what you are seeing). To list installed things relating to Java: 

indicating I have 182 MB free (from 256 MB total). Not bad while running rtorrent, streaming an HD video via SMB, serving webpages, and reading weather sensors. I don't know what I would do on a headless box with the GB in the rpi2. 

Sleep is a good tool for pin monitoring (no cpu usage). Python is a bit memory hungry so you want to keep the process count down but 1GB is a lot to play with so you likely won't have to worry. Use cron for the sensors to reduce memory overhead and coding. 

This is presuming the LCD is attached by DSI ribbon cable. That should also rotate the touch coordinates too. 1 = 90° 2 = 180° 3 = 270° $URL$ 

I'm trying to configure the DNS settings of a Fritz!box 3490 so that the host names are revealed in Pihole. 

If you haven't already changed the default password and disconnected from the Internet, start there. If the scrot captures continue check /etc/rc.local for odd entries. 

Replace the SD card. Always have a spare with a known working OS. They aren't expensive and it doesn't have to be large or with a fast read/write speed (class 4 or 6 is fine to test) 

Now we have xte, which can simulate the movement of the mouse and keyboard keypress Examples of xte usage Move the cursor to the point x = 10 and y = 20 on the screen grid 

Use SD Formatter to clear the card as this also checks to confirm that the card is not corrupted. If it keeps saying that it needs formatting then it's time to scrap it and start again. 

Set up a pihole and don't use either of the ISP DNS servers, while blocking ads, malware and telemetry. This can then also be used to protect other devices in your network. 

$URL$ the IR modules are very cheap on eBay and could be powered either from the R-Pi or a standalone battery. 

Yes the repository must be specific to the CPU architecture you are using. Raspberry Pi Is not a x86. 

If you have a key from some other install cached in ~/.ssh/known_hosts for that IP, ssh will warn you. Just remove the old key to remove the warning. Putty uses the Windows Registry instead of a text file as it's the windows way. 

Because booting worked, failed, then worked, sdcard corruption is unlikely, but maybe a file system check was forced slowing down the boot. 

This script can be used on the rpi it is resizing. It assumes the root partition is the last one and it's name is hard coded. backup before use. Read the man pages for extended details. 

No; The pi B and B+ get a lot of THD around 10kHz (ref). The Hifiberry claims 192kHz (ref) but fails to show a frequency response curve. Some Linux is not supporting anything over 192kHz (ref). The HiFi Shield for C2/C1+ will do 50kHz (ref). No Pi has a dedicated DAC (ref) so sound is PWMed to about 11 bit 10kHz. So, if someone made an amplitude fall off curve for an external DAC, and you found a suitable amplifier and speakers, it might be worth a try. 

Install raspbian or OSMC from here; $URL$ I have nothing nice to say about NOOBS which you are having trouble with. 

There is usually a small icon that appears in the top right corner for overheating (and another for under-voltage) 

It's fine. I've done it on loads. There is nothing it fouls. Don't go too large with the bolt head. I opened mine to 3.8mm. Old post about opening up the holes 

Connect a wire to pin 11 and a wire to a Gnd pin. I'm not sure how well Kodi plays with GPIO switches so it may have to be within Raspbian. 

Use the package piclone, it's installed by default on the full Raspbian image. Great way to build, tweak, clean up and backup an installation. A 16GB SD card with Raspbian can be striped to less than 8GB and then written to an 8GB SD card. I've got images down to 4GB and used a 4GB card to receive the backup clone. The card can then be read to an IMG file on a PC using Win32diskimager. 

I'd suggest a USB to LAN adapter (very cheap on eBay) and set static IP addresses on both devices. Or the hotspot method mentioned above. Or - use a smartphone with hotspot, Fing (to scan for the R-Pi IP and scan running services) and JuiceSSH (for the SSH bit) 

Fault with the image flashed to the SD card or the SD card is bad. Format the SD (using SD Formatter) and try again, Check the SD is the size it is supposed to be using F3 in Linux to test maximum write size before errors. Check the integrity of the downloaded ISO/IMG file. 

Start here: $URL$ vhosts is likely what you want because Patricks answer (running 2 services) requires more RAM which is limited on the raspberrypi. 

As It can conflict. (they use the same port) You can also just disable it's invocation if you want to keep using it. This is what it looks like on my raspbmc where ntp seems to be working 

select popular open source so there will be many options for them. There are new options every year, some of them may meet specific needs better than the products listed, but this overview should give you a general idea of what to start comparing. 

The Fedora ARM version will only run on the rpi2 (ARMv7). No one has bothered to make an ARMv6 build of 21 or 22 yet. Keep an eye on this; $URL$ 

is what it sounds like; a place for applications to receive input events (like a mouse click). As @rob noted the USB interface on the raspberrypi is somewhat unstable so not using it (or using a power isolated powered hub) are good first steps to otherwise inexplicable behavior. 

That will permit ssh(22) in from anywhere and http(80) in from only your local network (assuming your gateway is 192.168.1.1). The rules are obviously changeable via ssh, or you could just use a vpn and never expose anything on that NATed computer directly to the web. 

Force the screen to stay on: From an SSH session in PuttySSH or a terminal session on the Raspberry Pi itself: 

Keep it simple and prove your project is worth the effort of a UPS. Just add a momentary switch to short a couple of GPIOs that triggers a shutdown. The Pi will power up when the car is started next time. Be wary your supply is only delivered after the engine has started, to prevent a dip during the ignition process. Create a script: 

I've tried only setting the WAN DNS to the Pihole and leaving the DHCP to the Fritz. Unless static IP and DNS is set, network device requests show as coming from the Fritz. 

Use the package piclone. It will copy the current running system to SD which can then be backed up to your PC using win32diskimager. Hint: remove as much stuff that you don't use in the running image as possible to get the backup file size small. Use as small an SD that you can to keep your back up files small, also reducing image read and write in the future. Hint 2: expand the partition on any backup SD cards as this isn't automatic. 

Not quite sure what you are trying to achieve so here is a script that uses pull with explanations, maybe it'll help.
