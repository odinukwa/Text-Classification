@PHLiGHT, hello there! your cisco 861, imho, has overloaded by ingress traffic. Lets look on your cisco iface counters: 

Because STUN(external server), cant know which port will be given to the client by NAT-device. In symmetric NAT, client gets unique port(ip:port in pool situation) on each connection 

Alex, hеllo there! Ive builded test environmet for you, so i am using freeradius 2.1.12+dfsg-1.2 (on debian), and switch hp 2650. Ive just repeated your config, and have no problems with this. My test procurve ip 10.0.10.29, test freeradius ip 192.168.2.60. procurve config: 

It depends on your device model. For instance CE (cloud engine) switches, AR and N40 routers are supporting OPS technology (Open Programming System). OPS is quite similar to Cisco EEM and, in addition, it might be able to process python scripts. Hope this helps. 

There is no significant reasons to use different vlan in your situation, but, some vendors(cisco at least) recommends to use this way: for example, we have N branches, and we need four routed broadcast domains(LAN) on each, let`s calculate them: branch1 = 1 branch2 = 2 ... branchN = N 

forwarding proccess, forwards frames. learning proccess, writes incoming frames source addresses to the fitering database filtering database, holds info about what host can be found behind what interface, used by forwarding proccess. 

ps very strange is to see 76 runts, as usually, it caused by collisions(can be only in simplex mode), but in config we have "duplex full". imho, clean counters, do not change duplex mode, wait some time, runts are shouldnt increase. pps i guess, this situiatuion cant cause serious problems, because you have "only" 1 error on each ~500000 packets, it is not too bad in most cases, really ;-) 

I have a site-to-site VPN from a Cisco ASA 5512 and a Cisco 891. I want all traffic, even Internet access, to come through our ASA. The VPN is established and working. The LANs have connectivity to each other, but the remote LANs on the 891 have no Internet. I've been working on this a while, experimenting and researching, but I can't seem to figure out what I'm doing wrong. The traffic seems to be getting dropped at the ASA when doing a traceroute. I'm assuming it's a NAT rule or VPN policy. I've looked through the group policy to find nothing of interest and tried multiple NAT rules that I assumed I would need. I have the config of the ASA, the 891, and a packet-tracer output from the ASA testing a ping from a remote LAN user, 172.17.55.x to 8.8.8.8, which is dropped at phase 8 ipsec-tunnel-flow. I'm sure it's an amateur mistake I've made, but I just can't seem to find it. Any help is appreciated! ASA Config 

When it comes to managing access rules in Cisco ASAs I always use ASDM because it's easier for me to visualize, troubleshoot and manage. I recently created a VPN filter for a S2S IPsec VPN and noticed something strange. TCP/UDP object groups do not appear to be working as they normally do in an access rule vice ACL Manager for VPN filters. I had to create an IP object and specify source/dest ports instead. Here's what ASDM preview enters into CLI. Keep in mind src/dst syntax for VPN filters is backwards. using TCP object group (doesn't work): 

Is it possible to do that without VLANs ? yes, but why, you have good switch?! ;-) How should be configured MikroTik WiFi router ? In what mode the WiFi router should work ? If your switch is in default config, then you just need to connect wifi-router ethernet1 port to the switch. This will be "wan" for wifi-router, add address to this interface for. example 192.168.1.254, set gateway 192.168.1.1. It will works. If you want to limit connections from 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.1.0, set acl on mikrotik. But, if you want, to permit 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.2.0 and deny 192.168.2.0 to 192.168.1.0, both, you need: 

All this operations are uses CPU, which is shared by another OS proccesses, this is an important. So what is typical switch? Switch, as usual, have multiple (!)different type(!) processors: 

Matt, good question! Bridge and switch are almost same things. Bridge, now(in 2014 ;-), is a basic function of the ever modern OS, so this is software. Lets look on bridge architecture(bridge operations are described in ieee 802.1D), bridge must have: 

So, when switch forwards frame, it is uses just ASIC, and in theory, CPU can be overloaded, but switching will works fine. ASICs and CPU are separated, ASICs even haves own superfast memory(CPU have typical RAM). When you are send configuration command to your switch oven ssh\telnet, CPU recieve commands from ssh\telnet process, and send them to the ASICs. Switches architecture is very complex, and it is vendor-specific, IMHO, modern switch this is true-engineering-excellence. 

Connecting two SG500X-48's through XG1 on both sides with fiber. When I plug in the connector, the link light blinks rapidly a couple times (varies) then stops and goes dark. No connection, interface status is down. I've ran down the obvious so far. Fiber cable is good, and switches are in standalone mode. I'm mainly curious why the link light blinks then stops? Does this indicate a specific issue? (auto-neg failure, etc.) I've searched for what this means, if anything, and came up empty. Thanks 

I'm trying to set up a DMVPN Phase 2 configuration, but I cannot manage to get past Phase 1 because the hub router's tunnel interface refuses to disable split-horizon. The spokes never form an EIGRP adjacency to teach other and never learn routes directly to the other spokes. I'm looking for suggestions on something I may be doing wrong. I've tried disabling on the interface itself and in the routing configuration as well just be sure. When I check the interface, it still says split horizon is enabled. I haven't added any optimizations commands yet or anything unnecessary to establish communication. Once I can get my spokes talking directly, I'll worry about improving the configuration. This is solely a test environment right now. EDIT: To clarify, the fact that spokes receive no routes to other spokes and never form adjacencies tells me that split horizon is still on. The Tun1601 interface shows split horizon still enabled. Sh ip eigrp interface says thats its disabled. Short of taking a packet capture and investigating what's really happen, it seems it is in fact not disabled. Hub: 

for tunnel interfaces networks, (we are) as usually, uses 172.16.0.0 network, with same rule: 172.16.N.0/30 - left side of the ring(or main uplink) 172.16.N.5 - right side of the ring(or reserve uplink) if you have more than 255 branches, than you just need to use binary calculation, and you will get much more economical utilisation of address space(say if you need formula, i can provide it for you). imho, this is good way, because you always know, in one look, what branch network, what branch vlan and what tunnel you are looking. 

But, I`ve disabled usage of logged user creds. So, if user creds are correct, i have this message in /var/log/freeradius/radius.log 

syntethic task ;-) STUN can be used only with "full cone NAT, restricted cone NAT, and port restricted cone NAT"… but not with symmetric NAT. STUN is the protocol for clients, but clients, as usually, in real world are using symmetric NAT(unique port for any connection, dynamic translation)! In the real world servers are using full-cone NAT(static translation), and servers, as usually, gets connections from clients, which are already know ip:port… However, formal answer: most "frequent" using of STUN it is sip client to server keepalive(udp), but there are also other usages: $URL$ 

you have 655 throttles, so there is two major reasons: cpu overload, buffers overload. and you have 338 errors ("149 overruns" + "189 ignored"), i guess this is (too) caused by overload of your router. details: overruns, ignored and userfull cisco pdf about drops troubleshooting it is very interesting for me, to see output these commands: 

I have a /28 block of public IPs from Comcast. I'm trying to put a public IP directly on the ASA outside interface, but when I do I cannot ping 8.8.8.8 or the Comcast modem. Internal communication is fine, but there is no external or Internet connectivity. Also, if I run packet tracer simulating from inside int 172.17.25.1 to outside 8.8.8.8 it says it's blocked by an implicit rule. However, I have even tried opening up both interfaces with any/any in/out and it still says it's blocked. I have also already enabled ICMP inspect. I can't figure out why traffic is not being passed on the external interface even to a directly connected device. The Comcast router is in virtual bridge mode. 

Solved. Appears to be an undocumented Cisco bug using ASDM that did not like the object-group created by ASDM when using multiple objects in a NAT statement. The ASA was building connections to the wrong interfaces. Cleared out the NAT statement, built an object-group, applied, and connections started building as expected. Appreciate the help! 

I have a 1941 out of the box. I can't find documentation on this anywhere, but I'm wondering if the router will pass all traffic by default without adding any ACLs? I'm curious if the implicit deny all is only triggered after you add your first ACL, or is it always there to begin with? Will the 1941 pass traffic without adding ACLs? 

We replaced a Meraki MX with a Cisco ASA, and I'm unable to reach the public IPs of servers behind our firewall now. The server has working Internet access. All packet tracer runs show successful NATing and are allowed. The firewall is open to limit the problem while testing. I'm assuming it's a misconfigured NAT rule or another option I've forgotten to enable. I've been at it for hours, and I can't seem to ping the public IP nor access it externally for services. The ASA is directly behind the ISP modem. The server IP is 192.168.108.44 NAT'd to 5x.xx.xx.53. Any help is greatly appreciated. ISP modem settings:
