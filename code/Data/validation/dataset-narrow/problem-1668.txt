The converted NEWGIF.gif should work properly with What is coalesce: coalesce is when a gif is processed so that each friend will have a fully defined look to form a film strip animation which will although increase file sizes will also optimize the gif to reduce load times, and to reduce cpu usage.

NOTE: you may have to revert changes to your overscan settings any any other changes you may have made 

so as stated in the comments you mention that after writing all zeros to the sd card using the command 

If I understand what you want correctly I believe that a chrome extension is what you are look if for and would recommend that you look into something like this as it should satisfy all your requirements as it only does the keyboard when an input is selected. 

Then by connecting the sd card and retuning the command listed above that will be the name of your sd card (note the name may change with disconnects). To forcefully unmount the drive you may use the following command listed below: 

It is because you are using an incorrect dns please change the line below to reflect upon a valid dns service. 

3. We are now going to install a package called twython which is my preferred way to interact with the twitter api, By running the following: 

I would recommend that you use an ultrasonic sensor placed at the top of the container to measure the water level relative to the top of the container then you may subtract that from the overall height of the container to find the true water level. Now to do this you would want to start off by selecting an ultrasonic sensor, I would personally recommend the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor because of its cost effectiveness and reliability. The sensor chosen should be mounted to the top of your container the container does not have a top then you should be ok, but if it does you will likely want to just drill 1 or 2 holes depending on your sensor type and have it mounted on top of the container to prevent humidity from rusting out the sensors circuits or worse creating a short circuit. After you have the sensor mounted you will want to wire it up to the pi, depending on the sensor you have you may need a different circuit to connect it but for the one that I have recommended above, the instructions for connecting it are included below. The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor has four pins ground, Echo, Trigger, and 5 volt in. The ground pin should be connected to the ground on your raspberry pi which is pin 6, now there are multiple ground's and 5volt lines on the pi and it really does not matter which one you choose to use. Now connect the 5 volt supply on the sensor to a 5 volt GPIO pin on your pi such as GPIO pin 2. Now connect the trigger pin on your sensor to a GPIO pin on the pi of your choice. Now since the sensor that we have chosen to use uses 5 volt logic but our pi's gpio pins will only accept 3.3 we will have to step-down the echo pins voltage but should be ok for the trigger as 3v3 should be enough to set the sensor off. Now for the echo pin on the sensor you will want to put a 1k resistor between the pin and a GPIO pin of your choosing on the pi, and the connect the same GPIO pin that you have just chosen to a 2k resistor and the other end of that resistor to a ground pin on your pi effectively creating a voltage divider. Now onto software below is an example script on how water level would be measured. 

After making the desired edits to the file please save and close the file then reboot your pi to see the changes take effect. 

you indicate that you have installed chrome directly from google.com, i am disappointed to tell you that the version of chrome you are attempting to install will not work on the pi as it has been designed to operate on 32 or 64 bit processors and not the arm architecture. I am also sorry to tell you that google does not have a version of chrome that will run on the pi without you running android on the pi first. But what you can do is install chromium-browser which is just like chrome and runs on a similar codebase, but instead is maintained by the community. 

I would personally recommend that you use either a dedicated power supply or a usb to 12v dc-dc boost converter like this. Furthermore do check whether or not your fan is capable of detecting a 3.3v pwm signal as that is the max and only voltage the pi's gpio operates on. which means that you will likely also need a dc-dc boost converter on your pwm signal as well. 

The instructions below Assume you mean 120volts at 20 amps which is the American standard. So we want to start by calculating the approximate wattage we could theoretically draw from the wall, which is volts x amps. 

Be sure to also forward port 8087 on your router as you have done with port 80 Note: is the IP address of example.com and is here solely for example purposes. 

i have personally successfully used multiple 4tb hard drives with my raspberry pi and see no reason why your 5tb and 3th drives would not be compatible with the pi simultaneously. The only potential problem that i can see arising would be that Fat32 is a file system that is limited to partitions that are 2tb in size, so formating a 5tb drive to fat32 may require 3 partitions, which is likely the reason that your windows pc is not recognizing the drive as being 5tb in size. you can read more about this phenomenon here 

You can run any two routers with the same name and password as you please. I do not believe that your client would automatically connect to the second router if it originally signed in with the first. As the wifi standard only has the password sent to the router the first time it is used, after that a session token is used. So let's imagine that you logged in with your phone to the first router, a session key was generated, everything was working fine. Then you walked over to the next room and your phone attempted to connect to the second router. Well that connection would be denied as the second router will not have the session key stored on it so it will not be able to authenticate your phone as having properly logged in. This is why large businesses and schools use enterprise grade products offered by large companies like Cisco. It's because they offer software and servers that allow for the sharing of session keys across routers. Now I'm not saying that you wouldn't be able to set something up like this yourself I'm simply saying that you won't find much help online as most people aren't using the Pi and that it is more difficult than you think. 

I recommend doing this with a small set of iptables rules redirecting all traffic to port 80 and 443 to your home page. 

a 1ma load shouldn't be a problem for the pi as it supports up to 50, but that click you hear is probably a relay and relays often require a large spike in amperage that your ammeter may not have picked up because of how fast it occurred, it would likely be safer to use a circuit such as one that goes off the 5volt gpio pin on the pi and connects to a transistor such as an npn transistor with the base being a gpio pin on the pi that when pulled to high would allow for power to pass through the 5volt line on the pi and into your amplifier. Furthermore the 5volt pin is isolated from the 3v3 power that your pi's microprocessor uses, as it is simply a usb passthrough which should also protect your pi during shorts, but will not protect your usb power supply, although it is likely that all but the lowest quality usb power supply have built in short circuit protection. 

Additionally you should have your HTTP server configured to redirect every unknown URL to its start page. So that if a user enters you don't get a 404 from your sense hat web server. This would in essence redirect them to . What the IP tables rules above are doing in essence is redirecting all traffic to your web server which in this case is your sense hat page, so if I where connected to your network and entered in any domain at all, i would be redirected to your page. 

Theoretically yes it would be possible but in reality lag would be a huge issue. Because of latency between whatever protocol you use. Furthermore audio would probably never work well as it requires a very low latency of processing for phone calls to not sound choppy. If you want to use your phone wouldn't it make more sense to simply buy a mount and stick it on the dash? 

Reboot your pi using to shutdown completely. Only remove the power after all green led activity has ceased. First weâ€™ll install fbcp (a live framebuffer mirroring tool) using directions from HERE 

The QEMU emulator does not exactly mirror the pi's actual boot process, likely because a lot of the cpu and gpu on the pi are not open source, and the kernel on the pi, is loaded by the gpu first. Because of the closed source of the gpu it is nearly impossible for the kernel that is being run on the gpu to be run the exact same way in an emulator. Furthermore because of its tweaked kernel becomes relatively useless as the kernel version is determined by the QEMU team, and it is relied upon them to make updates. 

The most common causes of your problem are an inadequate power supply or an SD card that isn't written properly, or isn't functioning properly. 

I'm no expert on the topic but I believe that the Pi will still place a load on your ups after it is shut down. Furthermore although you can't boot up your Pi using your pico ups what you could do is place a button between the ups and the Pi to allow you to temporarily cut power to the Pi, which would boot the Pi. Anther possible solution to your problem and this is the solution that I would recommend is that you google tutorials on reducing your pi's power usage so that you can have it run for longer on battery instead of having to turn it off. 

Start by taking the sd card out of your pi and plugging it into a computer. You then want to begin by locating a file on the sd card named: . You then want to look a line that looks like this . and what you want to do is to change it to one of the following as per your type of TV/Monitor and to remove the hashtag. 

If all you wish to do is to play a video on boot please open up /etc/rc.local using the following command: 

We start our adventure by installing an os onto our pi, this will require a minimum 4gb micro sd card. Click the download link that says "Raspberry Pi 2/3" Now after the image has downloaded, burn it to an sd card. If you do not know how, please google it their are a lot of tutorials on it and seeing that you were able to burn an img file before I'm not going to go over it. connect your raspberry pi to an HDMI or composite display and plug in a usb keyboard and mouse. Be sure to disconnect everything from your gpio pins before booting as the pi is only capable of driving a single display. boot the pi On first boot the system will ask you to configure an input device. it really doesn't matter which keys you use here as long as you remember them. press on your keyboard to exit Emulationstation and to enter the command line. Now we will preform some basic system optimization/configuration. Enter into your terminal then press enter. in the prompt use your keyboard arrow keys to go to then press enter. Inside Advanced options Set the following: 

Then save and close this file then reboot. Enjoy! and be sure to post any problems you receive in the comments and I will try and debug with you. 

You should try and use a better browser such as the one built by the raspberry Pi team you can install it by using the commands: 

Are you looking to only connect to it from a single IP address? As you could simply set a firewall that blocks all outgoing connections from ips that aren't yours. But more realistically what you'd want is for your custom login to authenticate the motion server, this would likely be done by having your custom login server also send a post request via Ajax to the motion server to authenticate both of them simultaneously. Please write a comment on this if you need help setting it up, but s great place to start would be to look up Ajax post request tutorials. 

We are going to start by turning off the pi and placing the sd card into a computer. We are now going to locate a file named on the sd card, if you find it open it if you do not please leave a comment for help we want to enter the following into the file: 

Your problem likely relies on the connection being dropped. Now you want to login to your router settings often by logging into and forwarding port 22 to the raspberry Pi's local ip. If you still can not connect to the Pi remotely, you can try changing the port you are using. As some ISPs will block all outgoing traffic on port 22, to prevent you from inadvertently making your ssh server public. To change your ssh port edit the file by running the following command: 

Now after running these commands and seeing if they work as expected we can move on to setting them up to start on the boot of your Pi. 

The quality difference between the HDMI port audio is that the HDMI port utilizes a digital output which practically guarantees a 1 to 1 reproduction of sound from the audio source. Where as on the 3.5mm headphone jack analog audio is utilized which is not perfect as there may be minute interferences in the signal, it is also substantially more difficult to produce a high quality analog sign. Although in the newer Pi models such as revision 3 the analog audio on the Pi has become substantially better. To produce a higher quality audio output I would recommend that you use a USB sound card. But if oh would like to instead use the audio from the HDMI port you would need to purchase something such as this which is an HDMI audio extractor, which will convert the HDMI audio signal to an analog one, although for this particular model you would still need to buy an RCA to 3.5mm adapter to be able to connect headphones.
