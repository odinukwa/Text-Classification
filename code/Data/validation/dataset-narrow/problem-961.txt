(assuming you're going to install the equivalent architecture/version of jdk that you installed of jre above) 

Which will prompt you for the password of on . You can also pull file/folders from a remote PC to your local PC. The command syntax for this method is as follows: 

It's not a case of browser/DNS hijacking. What's happening in your case is what is referred to as Typosquatting. From Wikipedia: 

As the CSI Tool in question requires the installation of modified firmware and drivers specifically for the Intel 5300 NIC, it will not work with Wi-Fi card in your laptop. From the FAQ of the CSI Tool site you provided: 

Since you weren't starting from scratch here you didn't have the option of installing Windows first since this is a reinstall of Windows on a system that already had a preexisting Linux partition. In a case like that you can try repairing Grub first if you really want to attempt to salvage your Kali partition. If it's there's nothing worth salvaging, just reinstall Kali. There's some chance Windows only overwrote Grub with its own bootloader and didn't erase your Kali partition, so you can attempt to simply repair Grub and hope everything else was left intact. One method of doing this is to boot into a live Linux USB/CD and repair Grub as described here at help.ubuntu.com: 

You'll find a lot of these sites with the names of popular sites (like github in your case) but using the .cm domain instead of .com From Wikipedia: 

Click on the File tab at the top Choose Options Choose Advanced Go to the General tab Scroll down until you see an option called Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). Currently this box is check. You want to uncheck it. Click OK to get out of that menu and you're done. You will be able to open your Excel file now. 

Click on the Start typing and you'll see an option come up called . Select that. Make sure the drive you want to turn off defrag/optimize is highlighted and then click on . Uncheck the box that says Click on OK and you're done. 

....and you will not run into all the error messages and find will be able to search through your entire file system for any directories containing valgrind. 

I'm not aware of any way of setting the IPv4 settings for a specific network only as opposed to a specific adapter, but I would suggest another approach for you particular situation. Windows allows you to set an Alternate Configuration for when no DHCP server is found. By default it is set to automatically give you an address in the through range when no DHCP server is found. You can change this default to specifc IPv4 settings of your choosing; in your case, your phone's wireless configuration. To do so, do the following: 

For an alternative method to Milad's answer for checking whether your Windows PC is currently connected to a Wifi network, do the following: 

For errors indicating is missing, you'll need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package On a 64-bit system go ahead and install both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the package Download both from Microsoft here: 32-bit : $URL$ 64-bit : $URL$ 

Which will also prompt you for the password to on . The problem you were running into with your command above is that you were using the data pull syntax of the scp command in order to grab a file from a remotehost, but you were also SSH'd into that remotehost while running it. The correct way to run this command is to run it from your local machine 

This removes the data under key from the localStorage, and reloading the page may restore it to 'factory settings'. If you're not sure if the particular key is set by the cookie notification functionality, you may open the page in incognito mode, and list the contents of localStorage before and after interacting with the page. Again, I doubt too many sites use localStorage for this purpose. 

This did not produce the result I expected. Is what I'm trying generally a good approach? How do I make this work? EDIT: Added diagram kindly provided by Cont7e 

With the above two lines in sudoers (you can edit the suoders with command), user account named will be able to run without password: 

The identifies the value set by JavaScript on the page you are on. If you believe does something relevant, you can try removing it by running the following: 

If you fancy using Linux, most distributions can be installed and booted off removable storage including external drives and SD cards. You could set aside a small partition on the external drive that is used for the Liunux OS, and then keep the rest as a FAT/NTFS filesystem. You will also need a tool on the Windows 7 machine that would synchronize the contents of the FAT/NTFS filesystem with a local directory. A tool like rsync is ideal, but not sure if one can be found for Windows. If you can't find it, another option is to run rsync from within the Linux OS on the external drive: boot it, sync the folders, and then boot Windows. Unless the files you are working on are large, I would suggest using an SD card instead of an external hard drive. It may not boot on some PCs, however, so you should first check. SD cards are far more robust than hard drives and there are large SD cards on market now that aren't too expensive (32GB should suffice for most purposes unless you are doing video or photo work). Booting from SD cards is also somewhat faster. 

I have a local network consisting of two virtual machines (for testing purposes). Both run Debians. I'll refer to them as A and B. My goal is to have A act as 'whole of Internet' for B (for HTTP requests on ports 80 and 443), such that using any domain name (even those that don't exist on the Itneretnet) return the response from the web server on A. I've installed a DHCP server on A, and made it use its own IP address as the DNS server address, and started a tool. On B, I can successfully connect to the first one and obtain the IP address as well as the nameserver address using DHCP. The is started with: 

You could probably use .netrc file (note: I havent't done this myself). You could either generate dynamically at runtime or have it sit there. EDIT: As long as your script has access to .netrc, so does the user that runs the script. So if you give the script to someone else and that someone else has access to the private key, it doesn't matter that you don't have the password hard-coded in the script. 

They asked you if you'd like to store preferences in cookies, not whether you'd like them to set cookies in general. So if I were writing support for this feature, I'd set a separate cookie (e.g., ) and check whether user has this cookie. There is a good chance you'll find such a cookie for that site, which you can clear without clearing other cookies or history. Inspecting cookies set for a particular page In Firefox, you can list cookies for a particular page by right-clicking a blank part of the page, then selecting View page info option. You'll find a "View Cookies" button in the "Security" tab. In Chrome, you have the same "View page info" option, which opens a dialog that hangs from the address bar. Link near the top will take you to a listing of cookies. I assume similar features can be found in other browsers. Discovering if site sets a cookie Here's one way you can discover what the site is doing. Open the site in Incognito mode. Open developer tools and switch to Network tab. Then check out what activity is happening in the background as you decline to have the site track you with cookies. Specifically, look for response headers and see if there are any 'Set-Cookie' headers in there. Then try deleting cookies mentioned in the header and see if that makes any difference. About localStorage Since another poster has mentioned localStorage (in-browser database), I'll comment on that as well. I think it'll be very rare that the site uses localStorage for this purpose as localStorage data isn't accessible to the server unless there is JavaScript code that sends the data back to server. If you wish to check the contents of the localStorage, the fastest way is to open the developer tools in your browser, go to (JavaScript) Console tab, and type . This should give you an output that looks something like: 

Besides that, though, what you're seeing is a result of the , combined with how Anki invokes to crop the resulting image. (Also, why the heck do you have it set to ? ) Let's take a look what's happening behind the scenes, when Anki generates an image from LaTeX: 

Okay, enough of the “why.” Unfortunately, as far as I know, this is not an easy problem to fix, and still get out what Anki expects. One approach, though, that will work, with your specific example, is to switch from a standard , to — a package with a feature specifically designed to do what we want to do, here (adjust the layout — stuff like your centering, for instance — within LaTeX, to typeset things to their smallest size.) Specifically, let's try the and options. Change your LaTeX prelude in Anki to the following, adjusted as necessary¹ to your needs: (notice that I've gotten rid of Anki's default line, as it's no longer relevant) 

Because of those, I want to examine one last alternative: Don't typeset your entire card in LaTeX in the first place! It's lucky we're on SuperUser, and not TeX.se — I'm pretty sure it's Highest Blasphemy over there, but quite honestly, Computer Modern is Effing Ugly on screens anyway (it's designed for print, and it's great there … but not so much on screens, which is where we use Anki); and more relevantly, Anki is likely to move to MathJax in the future (i.e. more consistent in-card rendering, as opposed to shipping around hacky pre-compiled PNGs like this.) It's more future-proof to rely on Anki's built-in web engine (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) for styling and typesetting, than to ship that all out to LaTeX! Rendering equations to PNGs using LaTeX is effectively, at this point, a hold-over measure. Basically, this can all be avoided, if you just typeset your card in HTML. Instead of: 

So, if I get an error from a plugin, I'd like to be able to report that error on GitHub or similar. Unfortunately, it's not mouse-selectable; and after appearing and asking me to hit RETURN, it seems gone forever. 

I have a RAID5 Pegasus R6, connected via Thunderbolt. At some point, it started making strange repetitive beeping noises; when connected, one of the drives wasn't showing up at all. Shortly thereafter, while trying to diagnose this, a different drive in the array went actually-DEAD (not missing, like the original one.) So, now my data's MIA; but I only actually have one dead drive. I need help getting the Pegasus to ‘see’ the missing drive, so I can begin to rebuild the dead one. Here's what I see: 

Thunderbolt is a complex standard; and I'm not sure if it's even open. I think you'd need to buy an expensive Intel controller chip (DSL6340, iirc?); and even then, it's no simple electrical-engineering task. Look at it this way: transferring data in the tens of gigabits per second is an impressive electrical-engineering task. Much more so when you have an active component negotiating and mediating that alternate-mode communication. I'd guess that this isn't a very approachable project on your home bench. :P 

(not ! the old-school one, unless you're manually changing with an add-on.) is invoked, to generate a DVI file from the concatenated LaTeX input: 

Ahhah! Do you see what's happening, there? Your equation is centered, from LaTeX's perspective — that is, the perspective of a -wide , which is what you have herein told it to generate; it's the cropping that's making it look like it's ofw-center. (Or, from another perspective, we could say that the equation is centered, and it's the text that's being payed-out poorly — it's offset far to the left, in your document.)
