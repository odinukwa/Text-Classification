I'm planning on creating a "Magic Mirror". I have already got the UI running to my likings and my Pi-zero is on its way. My concern is that having the mirror powered on 24/7, is not really eco-friendly. So I have also ordered a motion sensor to attach to the GPIO pins. I wanted to wire in the monitor's power button to another set of pins but was thinking of HDMI-CEC should the monitor I will be using support this. However, switching on a monitor at work made me realize that there is quite some delay when powering on the monitor. Is there some way to "slumber" the monitor so that it uses next to no power and is comparable to switching off the monitor while still switching on quickly? 

You have mounted a NTFS drive on unix, by default this is read-only. If you wish to mount NTFS to be able to write to, you will need NTFS-3G. Do know that NTFS in linux adds a rather large amount of overhead. An overhead that does pose a noticeable decrease in performance on a Pi. Consider using FAT32 or EXT3/4 instead, if this is an option. 

Seems like more of a problem with the network. Is the Pi in the same network/subnet even? check with : 

There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with your setup. The filesystem is expanded. If you want to transfer roms do it using the preinstalled SMB connection or the preconfigured USB key transfer method (read about it on petrockblog or the googlez) Just putting the SD card in a computer that doesn't automatically mount linux EXT3/4 partitions won't do since you will most likely only see a very tiny boot partition formatted in FAT. 

Most likely the files are owned by the user running the python script. My guess is that you are probably running that as root? when doing an ls -l you will see the permission bits, owner and group. ie: 

I would suggest to do as they do in most companies to manage a large amount of machines / a cluster / ... and use Puppet/Chef Here is an article on how to install it. 

The Pi's IP isn't set to static is what I can gather so far. Undo all changed you did on the pi, and set your Pi's IP to something static using your router's settings, then try again. You should then be able to at least ping your PI. Depending on the router used, you will probably see your Pi connected to it. UPDATE: 

The only way I was able to fix this, is upgrading to Jessie and rebuilding it from source. This time I didn't use but to not have those issues in future. 

I think by far the easiest way to share files is to set up an FTP server. Unless you want to share files through your Wordpress site. You will have to elaborate further what it is that you want exactly. To set up an FTP, here you'll find a guide: $URL$ On the other hand you could just make your Wordpress site host files. I'm not very familiar with WP, but it's pretty customizable from what I have heard, given that you know some php etc. Otherwise, you may want to give this a read as an alternative: $URL$ update: Since it appears you want some kind of web interface, maybe have a look at this project like you suggested in your link: $URL$ A quick google found me this guide for the installation: $URL$ Or look around on github for a "webdisk" project that suits your needs the most. EXTRA As stated in another answer here, owncloud is also a possible contender. However it doesn't run all that smooth on a Raspberry Pi, expect 3~5 second page loads with already optimised PHP. 

Have you tried to re-run again before the purge? This might allow you to properly install it before removing it again. It doesn't hurt to check if your disk isn't full. You can check with by running the following command: 

Next I tried to remove lib-cec and anything that said "cec" in its name. Doing so I kind of broke Kodi and the cec client was still there. After reinstalling Kodi again, I'm back to square one. Trying to install libcec from source, trying to also include RPI but again without success, with whatever I tried. The error below kept popping its head. 

(undo whatever it is you did to set a static ip on your pi) Log into your router's UI Configure a static IP for your PI from there 

I just read that bit: you are connecting your laptop directly to the pi? This will only work with a crosslink cable. (google more on this if you really want to do it this way) Best way forward is to connect your pi to your network. 

As already stated in the comments, you can't. A commonly used workaround is adding your own script that changes the boot OS like so: 

I went out and bought a Pi2, hooked it up to my TV's USB port for power. Installation and configuration of OSMC was easy and straightforward. No need for any Linux knowledge (not that would have been a problem). It works out of the box and very fluently, I have the menu at 1080p and 60hz, controlled with an Android device as remote. No stutters or lag or any of that. Haven't found the need to buy the extra licenses since it seems to work without them. No need for IoT W10 after all. 

No you can not just meddle with the SD card as far as I know. Tricky fixes I can come up with (not "clean") A: You could try and SSH into the Pi in your network, change the scripts and save them, send it back to your brother. B: Change the SSID/PW of your brother's wifi temporarily to get into the pi over SSH and change the scripts. Use Putty as an SSH client for a Windows machine. note: you can check the router to see if the Pi is connected or not. 

Try disabling the firewall on your router (and Pi if it's running one) check the SSH config for timeout settings or try another powersource, I know yours is up to spec but cable/power source can vary wide. You wouldn't believe how many times the problem can be traced back to the power on Pi related issues. It could have something to do with the USB drive, if you have a spare SD card lying around you could try and use it to troubleshoot this issue a bit further. Lastly, check the log files for clues. 

You can't really tell with 100% certainty. Just be sure to use a power supply that's up to the task (5V 2A), and a decent quality SD card. What you can do however, is verify the Download. The Raspberry Pi Foundaton provide the SHA-1 hash of the download. (looks like a string of random letters and numbers) On Windows You can use a utility (by Microsoft) called fciv or a tool called Summer Properties. On Linux 

and finally reload daemon and start the service: systemctl daemon-reload systemctl start getty@tty8.service Note that if you exit tty8 session, you wont be able to use it until next reboot or manual start by systemctl, except if you leave Restart as ‘always’, but I highly recommend to avoid this according to security reasons. 

and verify if the files are there. If not, scp them in. From a windows machine, best use a tool like winscp for this. A restart of EmulationStation could help to re-index the roms. Do note that the roms have to be of the correct file extension. (can also be a zip file for SNES) 

I have a retropie setup (Wheezie) running, and a while back installed libcec to get my TV remote to work with the Kodi package Installed via Retropie. ( This works by the way ) I was tying to have a go a python and the cec package to see what I could do with it. However it threw lots of errors and I couldn't import the cec package. So I decided to try the terminal first. With little succes (see error below). 

If you have a Nvidea Gamestream supported GPU this can be done with better performance over VNC. Moonlight is the opensource clone of Nvidea's shield technologie. It works rather well and can stream sound and video to client devices. Instead of streaming traditional Steam client or games, you use the remote desktop exe on a windows host for example, als a source application. 

It seems that your Interface doesn't support wireless statics collection... Maybe another wifi device does support this. Otherwise I think I'll have to disappoint you, Google told me mac80211 support has been phased out in the tool you are using. Link here. you could try , this reports QOL and signal strength. 

Currently I have installed retropie on my pi2. It serves as my retro gaming device over blutooth with my ps3 controllers. However I have also installed Kodi via retropi and find myself using it for kodi more than for gaming. I'm contemplating of flashing OSMC over the retropie install and using the RCB / Kodi game emulator addon for infrequent gaming. Has anyone used both? I don't have much spare time to play around with this anymore, so I just want to set it up and forget about it. Should I flash? or isn't Kodi + gaming addon mature enough to compete with retropie?
