IPSec IPSec Tunnel. You need to verify that your routers have a security feature set, or VPN capability. If they do, IPSec VPN is the tried and true method for doing this. 

A missing default gateway on an IP endpoint can cause this. Also, the source address of the ping can cause this. If you just type and press enter you'll get options including the ability to source that packet off a particular interface. 

Stacking makes for a single control plane and an outage of the entire stack during software upgrades. Therefore, a single stack is not advisable. For a ring topology, Dell has Force10 Resilient Ring Protocol (FRRP). 

Practically speaking, you don't need any cables at all. WiFi (wireless LAN) technology is dirt cheap and has reached LAN speed/performance. Every laptop, tablet, and smartphone ships with a WiFi network interface card, NIC. Many PC's ship with them, or can have one plugged in. All you need is a WiFi access point, sometimes called a WiFi router. 

If it's a private link do you really need to encrypt? Maybe so? Just asking. If so, you need to disable split tunneling on the branch sites VPN/Security appliance. Other than that just a default route pointing to the VPN peer (HQ) should do it. Oh, and you'll need to have a route back to the branch subnets in the HQ devices so they know how to route packets. The allowing of particular destination subnets to traverse the VPN tunnel may also be required to be configured. 

Configuring Protected Ports Some applications require that no traffic be forwarded at Layer 2 between ports on the same switch so that one neighbor does not see the traffic generated by another neighbor. In such an environment, the use of protected ports ensures that there is no exchange of unicast, broadcast, or multicast traffic between these ports on the switch. Not sure your Huawei switch has this feature. It appears to be a layer 2 switch. I was going to recommend ACL's to achieve it but it likely won't have that if layer 2 only. 

Longest Prefix Match relates to IP, or layer 3, forwarding. There is no such thing as longest prefix match for MAC (layer2) addresses. Control plane and data plane are unrelated concepts. 

You need to configure Access Rules. Below is an example to get you started. You need to build yours to suit your needs. 

It depends on your PSTN provider. Some will allow you to put anything in the 'calling number' parameter during call setup. Usually though, they will filter out spam. However, you might be able to work with them, or maybe search for a provider that will allow this. Alternatively, route the traffic through the UK - for real. 

They are feature licenses, thus the "FL-". It means your router is licensed to run the telephone system functionality within your Cisco OS, called IOS. Your router is a PBX, an IP-PBX, ...among many other things. 

This is likely a memory / memory leak issue. See Verifying NAT Operation and Basic NAT Troubleshooting 

Networking equipment is not typically stress tested for throughput by end users, rather POST test are done. Power On Self Test, or burn in's are done. Basically, you plug in the power supplies and let the things run for 24 or 48 hours. Interface hw errors typically show themselves immediately upon install. If there are problems with non-power related hardware, the device will typically simply not function properly. Most hardware problems are from shipping and most gear is stress tested for throughput at the manufacturing stage. Software can have issues such as memory leaks and bugs which are typically known and documented, provided that you are not running bleeding edge code. So, try and run tried and tested code and POST test your gear. That's what I have seen done in practice. 

TCP/IP is synonymous with Internet protocol suite. Notice the 4 conceptual layers of the protocol suite and that IP is at the Internet layer while TCP, which does have flow control and acknowledgements, is at the transport layer. Clear separation of functionality between layers is key to the architecture. The network layer is said to be encapsulated by the transport layer. 

Yes, a stacked switch topology is not proper for a data center, however it's fine for an IDF. Why? It's not 99.999, more like 95-99% uptime due to ISSU ain't gonna really work. The port channels are simply a link/layer 2 bonding mechanism. Put the default gateway interfaces on the firewall. Done. The next gen solution is SDN-ish, whereby the firewalling happens directly on the network port that the endpoint connects to. That way you can (1) sniff all traffic, even intraVLAN and (2) the firewall policies follow the endpoints as they move around the physical infrastructure (data centers). BTW, if you are talking about Cisco Nexus, below is how you do it (notice DO NOT dual home FEX's) 

Understanding and Configuring VLAN Routing and Bridging on a Router Using the IRB Feature Background Information In order for a VLAN to span a router, the router must be capable of forwarding frames from one interface to another, while maintaining the VLAN header. If the router is configured for routing a Layer 3 (network layer) protocol, it will terminate the VLAN and MAC layers at the interface a frame arrives on. The MAC layer header can be maintained if the router is bridging the network layer protocol. However, regular bridging still terminates the VLAN header. Using the IRB feature in Cisco IOS® Release 11.2 or greater, a router can be configured for routing and bridging the same network layer protocol on the same interface. This allows the VLAN header to be maintained on a frame while it transits a router from one interface to another. IRB provides the ability to route between a bridged domain and a routed domain with Bridge Group Virtual Interface (BVI). The BVI is a virtual interface within the router that acts like a normal routed interface that does not support bridging, but represents the comparable bridge group to routed interfaces within the router. The interface number of the BVI is the number of the bridge group that the virtual interface represents. The number is the link between the BVI and the bridge group. 

Your question says "How to connect to devices that have a the same ip address 192.168.1.1. Clearly this is not possible because a IP address needs to be unique." However, that is exactly what Cisco's IOS SLB Feature indicates. See below. Configuring IOS Server Load Balancing with HTTP Probes in the Dispatched Mode 

The term managed switch is entirely meaningless to a network professional yet conveys a type of value to an end user. Basically, it is a marketing term. 

These terms refer to Wide Area Networking at the link layer, i.e., data link layer. Sites/branch offices can be connected via dedicated end-to-end links (point to point) or they can be connected via a single link to a shared infrastructure, sometimes called a cloud. The benefit of the mesh topology vs point to point is that spokes/branch offices can: 

Several flavors of WiFi (or 802.11 as nerds call it). Sometimes old legacy flavors such as 802.11b can sometimes downgrade the whole WiFi WLAN as the AP has to serve up data using old out-of-date mechanisms. Turn off support for old poo poo devices. Only enable 802.11n (circa 2009 technology) and up? Something like that.... Give that a try. Also see MR Hospitality Design Guide (CVD) 

Implement Ethernet subinterfaces on the ASA, an 802.1q trunk to the LAN. Both subnets can exist on a single VLAN or your can deploy 2 VLANs on the LAN. 

Engineer and architect are well established titles with accompanying testing, recognition, and requirements. These titles often have special legal protections. It is unfortunate that the I.T. industry has co-opted these titles. Regarding network architecture and network design, you will not find an authoritative and recognized differentiation. They mean the same thing. Since network design does not infringe upon the architecture industry, I prefer to use the term network design. That's my 2 cents... 

I have a customer with 3 sites, 5000 users. 2 sites are Data Centers and 1 site is HQ. The sites are connected via ring topology with 10G MetroEthernet service - that's 6 10G ports in all across 6 Dell 4048 switches - 2 switches per site. My idea is to stack these 6 as a single logical switch vs configuring them as standalone switches running VLT between the pair at each location. I do not see any reason why I would not simply stack them as one switch. Anyone have a good reason not to stack these Dell 4048's into 1 logical switch? What's a better topology and why? 

No. But what you can do is get a circuit in country you want to talk from and then from that circuit, you can tunnel/route all the traffic to a different location - any location at all. You are not in control of the public IP address assignment at all but you are in control of traffic once it gets to that address. 

Stateful firewalls keep state information. So, port(s) are in fact opened for your response to reach you. 

The metrics are only part of the routing process. The longest prefix match always wins among the routes actually installed in the routing table, while the routing protocol with the lowest administrative distance always wins when installing routes into the routing table. 

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model defines a hierarchical conceptual computer networking/communications architecture that is, by and large, obsolete. The Internet Protocol suite, originally developed by the U.S. Dept. of Defense (DARPA Agency), is the dominant and de facto standard computer networking model in use today. The Internet Engineering Task Force, IETF, is the authoritative body of the Internet Protocol suite. The World Wide Web (web browsers / websites) adhere to protocol specifications published by the W3C, namely HTML and CSS, and by ECMA International (often simply called JavaScript). The physical wired and wireless standards fall under the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE. 

I don't know about the exam, but in the real world something like this would be done using Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM). See Also EEM script to report routing table change 

Yes. The Cisco ASR 1001-HX is one that is advertised to do it. Just step through 2 clicks of Cisco's router selector and see all the boxes that do 10G+ of IPSec. 

The input rate histogram shows that the input rate peaked at 9 Mbps and 4 minutes prior to the command execution. During that one-minute interval, there were 35 input multicast packets and 247 input drops. The counter values in the histogram should be read vertically. The output rate histogram shows that the output rate reached 8 Mbps twice; once 7 minutes prior and the second time 26 minutes prior to the command execution. There were no unknown protocol drops and no output drops during the last 60 minutes. The table below describes the significant fields shown in the display. Table 2 show interface history Field Descriptions Field Description Mlcst Ethernet input multicast. iDrop Input drops. Unkno Unknown protocol drops. oDrop Output drops. Related Commands Command Description history (interface) Enables an interface to maintain utilization history. 

Professional grade websites are typically served via a content delivery network, CDN, whereby the files/data are served from several mirrored servers across the globe. Your request to that URL/website address resolves to the server (IP address) closest to you. If you don't physically move, you should be hitting the same IP address (resources) every time / every day. It is possible that your network provider is jacked up. For example, I've been to a large corporation where my Internet was routed out 3000 miles away from me and across time zones. As a result, lots of Web application layer stuff breaks such as default Map views, calendar invite times (timezone issues), etc. 

This is usually due to poor software design. Memory leaks, failed 'garbage collection', etc. Could also be a misconfiguration though. To fix, find Cisco's current recommended version of IOS to run on your device. If the problem persists, use and it's variants (e.g. ) to figure out what process is hogging up your box. 

It's gonna look like in the running configuration, e.g. from the admin console. It's the dot, ...after the dot. The main interface will probably show or something like that. We call them subinterfaces typically for the .x VLAN interfaces. The dot1q has nothing to do with the VLAN number, it's the specification for handing VLAN's. So you might have subinterface int G0/0.2 for VLAN2, for example. 

Practically speaking probably but not necessarily. Your Web server is actually an application running on a server, so it's more complicated than just the Ethernet and/or IP networking layer. The servers CPU/memory utilization may also be a factor. A better architecture would be to use Comet, or XHR long polling. 

If you simply want to send datagrams, jQuery AJAX should work fine? (AJAX uses HTTP) Raw sockets on top of node.js. If you want to develop something: I use node.js. You can craft anything you can imagine. Google Cloud Platform, for example, offers a free 60-day trial of up to (30) VMs w pubic ip addresses that you can develop/test on. Alternatively, you could get a $50 rasperry pi and network it (provided your ISP allows you to map/have a routable public IP). Here's an example UDP server and client. Hope that helps. 

The Benefit Automated distributed smart ports. Today, you link to a wired or wireless LAN which may include networking control features such as routing, firewall, optimizing, VLAN's etc. With SDN, these control features are available at the NIC/vNIC and are programmable via the SDN controller. The Driver SDN architectures are being adopted and driven by the deployment of private clouds such as OpenStack, Eucalyptus, vCloud Air™, and Apache CloudStack™. OpenStack's Neutron project, providing networking as a service between interface devices (e.g., vNICs), recognizes SDN as a possible networking solution for OpenStack Clouds [OpenDaylight: An Open Source SDN for Your OpenStack Cloud]. Eucalyptus Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) support is implemented with a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology [Understanding VPC and MidoNet]. 

Hosts are computers whereas nodes are all devices that have network addresses assigned. So, a router is not a host but is a node. Node (networking) Wikipedia In data communication, a physical network node may either be a data communication equipment (DCE) such as a modem, hub, bridge or switch; or a data terminal equipment (DTE) such as a digital telephone handset, a printer or a host computer, for example a router, a workstation or a server. If the network in question is the Internet or an Intranet, many physical network nodes are host computers, also known as Internet nodes, identified by an IP address, and all hosts are physical network nodes. However, some datalink layer devices such as switches, bridges and WLAN access points do not have an IP host address (except sometimes for administrative purposes), and are not considered to be Internet nodes or hosts, but as physical network nodes and LAN nodes. Host (network) Wikipedia Every network host is a physical network node (i.e. a network device), but not every physical network node is a host. Network devices such as modems, hubs and network switches are not assigned host addresses (except sometimes for administrative purposes), and are consequently not considered to be network hosts. Devices such as network printers and hardware routers have IP addresses, but since they are not general-purpose computers, they are sometimes not considered to be hosts. 

It looks like you can configure Link Layer Discovery Protocol on endpoint computers, Windows 10, and other Windows systems as well. This would be your best bet as LLDP would give you rich info. 

In the modern state of networks and from a wide-area networking perspective, circuit switched links are basically merely last mile circuits. Such links are often categorized as analog or digital, such as T1's, PRI's, or telephone lines (sometimes called 1FB's by business customers). The reality is once the traffic is onto the carriers network, it's all packetized and packet switched. So, beyond your last mile circuit, there is no nailed up and wasted capacity in your carriers system. You physically can't push more into your carriers system than the last mile link will support. 

What you describe is possible and has been configured countless times. Simply look up the commands to configure your networking equipment. Since you mention Cisco's VPN client, I assume you are using Cisco routers and Cisco Anyconnect VPN Client. First, configure the Site-to-Site (or LAN-to-LAN) VPN tunnel between A & B. Then configure the Remote Access VPN service on A.
