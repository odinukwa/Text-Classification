It's a little tricky with multiple IP addresses and different ports when configuring SQL Server. The most important bit, is that the whole configuration has to be done with the SQL Server Configuration Manager. 

Here is an example of a script that can be generated when you iterate through your steps and instead of clicking on OK, you click on the generate script icon and send to a new query window: 

It isn't just "the default behavior", it's the only behavior. Owners always have full control on their own objects (including grants and revokes on those objects). That's why separation of container schemas from accounts that login to the database is so key to database security. 

We now have everything in the database (up to LSN 30) and the SQL Server could free up the TLog to look like this: 

... varying performance, index fragmentation resulting in slightly worse performance than when defragmented. Possible solutions 

_Instead of dbo you could use for example db_securityadmin_ This will create a new role in your database. Feel free to use a different name than my suggested . 2. Assign Permissions to Database Role After you have created the new database role, you will have to grant the role permissions to delete data from your talbes. This is done for each table: 

But I Wanted to Allow The User to Truncate Tables If you really want to assign the TRUNCATE permissions to individual users (or to the new database role), then you will have to assign the minimum permissions as you previously mentioned in your question. 2. Assign User The ALTER Permission alternate solution Instead of my second step where you grant individual DELETE permissions to each table, you would assing the higher privileges to the database role: 

add a new column to your existing table move the data to the new column rename the column to rename the new column to test the data Drop the old column 

...then you might not have Enterprise Management Console installed. The Management Console is not required to have a fully functional Oracle RDBMS instance up and running. 

If this doesn't reconfigure the database control for your instance you might have to re-create the repository containing all the Entrprise Management Console configuration settings. You would achieve this be adding a parameter to the previous command: 

You can get at that information in the tempdb by following the following solution: reading temporary tables that aren't yours You can get some general information regarding tempdb by following the following post: DMV query to get at data stored in tempdb tables,... 

If the database backup history has the flag set to then you know that this backup was performed using a 3rd-party software that triggered the SQL Server Writer (VSS Service for SQL Server) which allowed the 3rd-party software to backup the database almost instantaneously. From the official documentation on what Snapshot Backups are: 

If your SQL Server instance is running on an application server and not on its own, then you might have to reduce the MAX memory setting for SQL Server to allow the application to have some share of the memory. If your SQL Server instance is running on its own, then try configuring the MAX memory setting according to the following recommendation: 

Issue 1 This error can occur approximately after 2048 connections have been made via the listener when running on a non-English Windows installation. Fix for Issue 1 Create a Windows User Group named Administrators on the computer where the listener.exe resides. This can fix the issue of the listener dying. Reference: I'll post the link for the first issue as soon as I find it again 

The documentation for MySQL has the following bit of information regarding the EXPLAIN Output Format: 

Change the password for the sa account to ensure nobody gains access to the server via this account. Ensure that the option Failed logins only is enabled at server level in the in the Server properties - xyz | Security tab | Login auditing section . (Better: If you have enough space for your ERRORLOG and are cycling the ERRORLOG at a regular interval, set it to Both failed and successful logins.) 

Reference: BACKUP (Transact-SQL) Depending on your error message, you might find that because you ommitted one TLOG backup file, that the restore is failing. Reproducing Issue Inserting data / creating backups I reproduced your situation on my local SQL Server with the following steps and was able to restore to a point-in-time with a transaction still open during the FULL and TLOG backups: 

When the FILESTREAM feature is activated on Microsoft SQL Server 2012 then SQL Server will create a "hidden" share on the system. The share is defined as follows: 

Possibly the developer is using a 3rd-party tool that provides a plug-in for SQL Server Management Studio. The 3rd party plug-in is started with SQL Server Management Studio and is trying to connect to the SQL Server using the credentials the process was initially started with. If the initial process owner of the 3rd-party tool is running with an un-privileged account that does not have access to he SQL Server instance the developer is connecting to, then you will possibly see multiple error messages in the file and in the Windows Event Log on the target server (see Link below for examples). If the initial process owner of the 3rd-party tool is not allowed to delegate permissions on its own object, then you might see the SSPI Handshake error. There is a Microsoft Blog article titled Common ‘SSPI handshake failed’ errors and troubleshooting which provides you with some ideas on how to find the main cause. Most of the SSPI Handshake erros are because a process can not handover/delegate the permissions during the SSPI Handshake to another user/process. 

Yes, you can but you have to set everything up. SQL Server (SQL) Login When you enable the option in the SQL Server Login window, you are basically telling the SQL Server to adhere either to the local security policy or to the policy defined in the domain. 

The TLog has come around and because their is free space at the beginning there is no need to increase the TLog size More modifications 

Database backups The backup job create sub-directories for each level of the database's instance. So if you are running the script on a server on an instance named and the database is named and you are looking at a Full backup, then the backup file will be stored in the following directory with the following name: 

And when you run the above statements against your database, you will get a summary of the expected decompressed data for each object. Following an example output for an object: 

You were really near with your solution. You just have to restart the SQL Server instance after changing the password as explained in the following article and ensure that Mixed Mode Authentication is turned on. Solution Reference: What is the default password for 'sa' account in windows sbs 2011 standard (I have modified the orginal listing slightly): 

Step 2. Enabling sa Account In the case of a deactivated sa account, just go ahead and enable the SQL Server account again. This can be achieved with the following script:
