Mercurial s files only if it is "not binary", where "binary" is defined as "contains a NULL byte". Do databases in MS Access () contain null bytes? 

When I close my browser it remembers "state" in the sense that it remembers what tabs I have open and text that I had entered into various forms. Is there a way to do something similar with my terminal sessions? I would happily spend quite a bit of processor time to guarantee that if my box suddenly shuts off, I can boot up to the same suite of , pages, sessions, etc. 

I was trying to move to , where the first is the system saying "things that are mounted", and the second is me saying "video and audio files". Something is clearly different about , but I don’t know if this answers @HackSlash’s suggestion about symlinks. 

Trying to browse to either of these in or leads to a error. Furthermore I'm not sure which one to navigate to, but is somehow able to figure it out! If I (or ) it chooses 

I sometimes open PDF's and then want them "sort of" open "to read later", but I'm not looking at them at the moment. While I'm not looking at them I'd like the OS to spend less effort keeping them up. In other words I'd like the OS to allocate resources away from some windows and toward other things I'm running. I just learnt of in another context. Is either or an appropriate program to "downshift" the processes I'd like to deprioritise? I've looked at some of the documentation but since this is perhaps a nonstandard usage of the tools I can't tell if they're right for my goal. 

I would recommend to just check the S.M.A.R.T values of the SSD to see if anything is out of the manufacturer stated normal values. Manufacturers generally design a SSD to give indications of it's life span, such as 'wear-leveling' counts. A good tool to check this is CrystalDiskInfo: $URL$ 

As always, any upgrade will be hindered by the weakest link in the system, keep that in mind if you purchase a SSD, but have a Intel Pentium CPU running. 

Quick fix: Startup chrome with this flag: Pop into the shortcut for running chrome and append that flag to the target like the image below: 

HP24 is the bugged version. You WILL need to "hack" into your hard drive's board and "talk to it directly" via Hyper Terminal. Good luck! I would try find a USB to UART cable in the house somewhere. U could use your friends ardunio uno and pull out the atmega328p chip, u'll just utilize the usb chip and connect using tx rx lines.

This looks like a standard LVDS (low voltage differential signalling) connector, commonly used for laptop LCD screens. In which case, replacements can be found on-line. The only thing is to buy a cable that will fit in your laptop. Length does not have to be exact, but its always better to have a longer cable than one that is too short. You can't cut and splice these effectively, not without good expensive tools anyway.. According to the specs you will be looking for a 40pin 2CH 6-Bit LVDS cable. I would like you to post up pictures of both connections on the cable, to confirm that it is not a proprietary socket (highly doubt it as it's not apple). LINKS: For two different types of motherboard connections. One is split for power 

So it seems like the problem is with local (¿socket?) connections rather than with the network itself. How can I go about debugging this? 

I actually emailed the package author and he wrote back that in this case it's not listed as a , but rather RVim automatically uses to write , unless you 

Lazarus' website is down, so I can't look this up. Where in Linux should I look to find its SQLite database of saved forms? 

So what's the missing link that I need to check that I might have done wrong? How come I can't into when I can into ? Anyone who can provide a link to an existing response or better search terms, I would much appreciate it. 

I right-clicked on something in chromium with relatively low memory. Chromium opened up some opaque right-click boxes and never filled them in and won't kill them. These are now covering part of all of my virtual desktops. (not virtual console though) 

I'm positive this question has been answered somewhere else but I'm not sure what to search for. (I'm trying things like "telnet ubuntu ssh daemon unable to connect".) 

When I open a new shell in I get an error message. This error message does not show up when I start a new shell in . What might be running at startup that I need to check? This isn't coming from or (I guess obviously since it doesn't happen except in . But I checked anyway.) 

It's fairly easy to setup a system wide vpn using tailored commercial software. Just download, setup, input login, and start vpn. Downside is that you have to pay. Most vpn's have easy to understand instructions. More generalized 'free' versions are slightly harder to setup such as OpenVPN. It's important to use a vpn provider that you can trust, as snippets of internet activity and info can be picked up at the emerging end of the vpn. Therefore it is wise to review the community standing of the vpn before purchasing it. Using a free vpn can be more often than not, risky, compared to paid vpn's. A good reasonably priced, and fast, easy to use, secure vpn which I have used for 1 year is: Private internet access, though I use it on windows. It is worth mentioning that this VPN provider is not stable on my iPhone and iPad (possibly because they use LT2P protocol), however the client software should be fine on your mac. 

Speed is dependent on a multitude of factors. I will list appropriate ones here. I'm guessing max speed should be around 70-90MB/s for 5400rpm WD portable drive. 

I can help with that! =) Here's my bat file code that i run regularly. Tell me what u want and i can customize the netsh part =) This is a windows only solution and just requires you to copy paste code into a txt file and change the ".txt" part (show extensions must be enabled in view) to ".bat" 

Other keys like and are working, but suddenly windows no longer maximise in . Restarting did not fix it. 

I because I don't want to change my order just for this one program. In general, programs I installed in , , and so on should precede defaults in , but I don't want bash to search through thirteen special directories just to find , which seems like it should be fast and immediate. Is there a more appropriate middle-ground than simply ing over particular programs whenever they seem to be executing the wrong version? 

I would assume this would be done with , but when I search FB page source for a command I see nothing. How else might they have done it? 

Something else in the OS was conflicting with that key specifically. Once I ed the problem went away. 

I can SSH into I can is on and match. is off. shows is and is . I believe I have my port opened correctly on the router 

I don't have a strong knowledge of DNS, but I do have a little bit, like I've done and flicked through some of the mentioned pages. When I sign onto what I'll call "corporate-free" wifi, tells me an IP (sometimes a "local" IP, sometimes loopback, sometimes a normal-looking IP) that I've connected to like a normal router would. When I look at I can see something has overwritten my normal one. The might be redirected to something unusual, and there's a parameter that wants to send me to like a "wayport". What is going on under the hood here? (Not too deep under the hood, please.) The level I would like to get to is, if for whatever reason the "wayport" doesn't play happy with linux, I'd like to be able to do something like edit to get myself to their agreement page. 

Did you check the Create Snapshot before restore? If yes, you can restore. If no, then I'm sorry to say it is gone forever 

You are right on track! Create the sys image before the grace period is over, and input key on each separate comp. Not familiar with Acronis Truimage, but should work! Sysprep is not limited to 3 comps, in fact it is designed to be used for your explicit purpose! SysP Info can be found here: $URL$ The security identifier only kicks in when the system is activated or trial expired. So it should be fine even with a standard unlicensed backup iso.

The USB 3.0 plug is significantly different from a USB 2.0 Plug. If you look into the USB 3.0 Plug, on the back-end roof of the plug head, there are 5 extra data transfer pins. When the pins are engaged, USB 3.0 Protocol is activated. Obviously the USB 2.0 lacks these extra pins, when it connects USB 2.0 is defaulted having no register of the 5 extra pins. Your Blue Snowflake by all means should work with Windows 8(.1) on a USB 3.0 Hub. Helpful diagrams can be found at this source (page 8): $URL$ 

Simple answer is NO, RAM will not affect speed of small files being written. Complex answer is: DEPENDS on how much data is being written at any given time. If more than ~ 4GB? (estimate based on system taking up 4 GB) at any given moment (high I/O count) then you will benefit from the increased RAM due to the write buffer being used more intensely. $URL$ Computer Science: Data is written to the RAM while a write to disk is requested. File copy may finish, but the operating system will continue flushing data from RAM to disk. This answer is written with Linux in mind. A faster speed will be achieved in your case with:

How did it know to do that? And what other tool should I be using to find out how my browser goes from to and loads something? 

I have a few terminals open. I'd like to send the processes in those terminals to a session rather than saving, closing, restarting under , and then getting the process back to the state it's currently in. How do I attach a running non-tmux process to a session?

When I start it’s meant to read from first thing. I’ve verified that this isn’t happening but have no idea why or how to fix it. When I at startup everything goes fine. 

What happened was: I had tried to without really being ed. (When I close my laptop, network and USB hard drives disconnect.) So files were actually being copied to 's root tree, one layer down in a folder called . (I had to back up with anyway, so the user-vs- protection didn't stop me.) In turn, files in (which was really ) were not behaving like the connected peripheral device I thought they were. I used to see which things really were mounted, and where. (You can also use to see which UUID a folder is on. ( shows this information too.) also tells me the names of the hardware volumes, which I've chosen to match the names of the mount points under . To prevent confusion between the old putative s and the new correct mounts, I mounted etc to . Then behaves as expected. 

Your Macbook HDD Write Speed is slow 30/35MB <-- limiting WD 2TB Portable 5400rpm file copy The data you copy is a multitude of over ~500 files thus slowing down copying Data is Fragmented, files are split physically on the portable HDD, thus requiring time to seek and return.

Also, I tried to find information on your motherboard... Dell Inc 0XD720 Couldn't find anything. It seems pretty old, used on a Dell Inspiron 6400... $URL$ It is Highly unlikely it is the same as the one on your computer. Hoping linux is just reporting false readings. 

Your settings seem fine, apart from the fact that you setup the dns on the wireless adapter and turned off the dns in the router. Privacy wise, a dns, if it wants to (and some do) it can log requests for i.p. of a server. Changing a dns does not affect download speed (youtube, google drive etc) only the establishment of connection which is normally .1 of a second. So why change? you only gain ~0.1 of a second connection speed. If you do, try to setup the dns on the router, not the adapter. It might change something. Also why is your gate way 192.168.0.1? it's on a different subnet.. change it back to 192.168.1.1 You specified wireless connection not "connecting" i.e. not authenticating. This can be due to the fact that some outside source is trying to crack your wifi router password... they can disconnect connections in attempt to gain packets of information. Post up the wireless settings page on the router, i suspect the card on the atheros to be conflicting with the router. i.e. b/g/n messing things up. 1st line of defence: firmware update. 2nd line of defence: sue the person using the 5Ghz transmitter for their remote control hobby =P (chances of your up to date set-up failing are very low, I personally am really surprised you are experiencing issues), I suspect interference. While you are still reading this these are my proposed suggestions, I am studying networking at uni so I know what I am recommending =) Research (thanks for your screenshots :) helps a BUNCH!): $URL$ Give this a read, seems applicable to you. 

I'm trying to understand better the different network-query tools such as , , , , and at the same time a bit more about the architecture of internet requests, servers, and the like (NIC, A Record, MX) whilst already knowing a little about TCP, nameservers, domain registrars, packet sniffers, HTTP headers, and IP addresses. That's my background, here's my question. When I or let's say www.valgrind.org (or valgrind.org) I get at least two different IP answers: 178.250.76.80 and 172.16.0.23#53. 

so it now looks like is clobbered. (I thought I† ed to to prevent this kind of thing…) But my filesystem is not smaller, making me think the files have not actually moved and I could do something to an inode to help the system find and organise those non-deleted files again. 

I got on wireless with , but thinks I'm disconnected. What I'm really trying to do is get on my VPN, and I usually do this through . It doesn't want to let me on VPN since it thinks I'm offline. 

$URL$ takes a plaintext message + password input and encrypts the plaintext. I want to do this locally on Linux. Is there a one-line command that will compute an encrypted version of my message that I can then email? My goal is for the receiver to be able to decode the message with nothing but the password. To be clear, I have no idea what various encryption schemes are (AES, openSSL, RSA, GPG, salt, base64, DES, CBC, reentrant) and not really interested in a research project. I just want a one-line command like
