Bring up the bonded pair of eth2 and eth3 on all hypervisors. Ensure that you can ping, etc. Then create a network on each hypervisor that will be using the new eth2-eth3 bonded pair. Move a non critical vm to new virtual network switch and start testing. 

You can read up on it here (RedHat SSD Tuning) Lastly, you might want to review your block sizes as harddrives and SSDs sizes to differ. But If you don't want to reinstall the system, then I think a remount with the disgard option should do the trick. Updated: The slow rm can be attributed to the filesystem write barrier as explained here Cheers, Danie 

A PEM is a file that contains both the key and certificate data. The order is important, KEY first, CERT Second. It's possible that you did not update the PEM file accordingly. 

Of course I can work around this by continuing the installation by hand through the virtualbox GUI but this should not happen in unattended installation. How can I force the installation process to restart the services without waiting for the user input? 

I use rsync v. 3.0.4 and when I need to move something I use it with the --remove-source-files. I prefer rsync than mv. Unfortunately, when I use --remove-source-files, the directories are left on the source side (as said in the man). Is there a way to remove directories too once moved all the files? 

In the bios interface of Serveraid controller is possible to set the PHY speed. Beside this there is a parameter called CRC check which can be set to true or false. Knowing this, some questions: 

Unfortunately this is shown inside the terminal and I couldn't find any way to hit "ok" and then, of course, I get this message. 

Once complete you can test command under the virtualenv, but this is not practical if you are going to use cron to setup certbot renewals. So deactivate the virtual environment, 

You are trying to create a file as a unprivileged user. I would recommend the following, cat the 3 files in a /tmp/www.mydomain.com location, then with sudo mv it to the correct place. 

Once done, do the same with the management network. That should work without causing too much of disruption. 

Or if you are feeling brave, embrace the power of memcached. You can store the images,javascript,etc as cached objects in memcached. This will require a small php script to go grab the required objects from the cache. This will greatly increase performance as disk writes are minimized, plus now you can utilize the extra RAM you added to the server :) 

Is there anyone aware of someone seriously working on thunderdbird to get write support on ldap shared addressbook? 

What CRC does exactly? Accordingly to wikipedia it should be an integrity check but how does it work? I discovered that setting this parameter to false my disks are finally recognized as sata2 rather than sata1 and speed are really increased. Why? I found this IBM paper in which they say: 'CRC Checkingâ€”(Default: No) Determines whether the controller verifies the accuracy of data transfer on the Serial bus. CRC Checking should be disabled on the controller and all devices if any device supported by the controller does not support CRC Checking." How do I discover if a hdd supports CRC? If CRC is disabled and a breaking event occurs, is there a risk? 

I have a X3400 with 8 x (43w7598 250GB SATA 3GB/S HDD) set in the frontal bay and connected to ServeRaid 8K controller. The raid array works well but, even if I set the controller PHY to 3.0 (rather then Auto or 1.5), all the disks negotiate 1.5Gb/s with the controller. This sounds really weird to me because the disk are WD Caviar Black Sata2 disks (bought from IBM). The firmware is the latest available from IBM (accordingly to the IBM ServeRaid matrix). Any tip? 

This will display "Script Completed!" on successful execution. or Only display error code when a exit status is not 0 

Hi Best would be to generate the traffic from cloud vendors. I pretty sure with a couple of VPS and bench apps you will be able to test performance. Just remember to have your graphing ready before you start and when running tests to run them at intervals 10%,15%,20% load and so on. Then you also need to graph respond times as load increases. 

I have found that a simple restart does not always clear the cache. The other way of doing it, would be to use the nscd command and invalidate the hosts cache. 

Install Ansible on a host that is able to reach all the hosts you want to scan. Follow the instructions: $URL$ Then set up a Hosts file 

the process gets stuck on the installation of libssl because it requires the user input to restart some services (ssh ntp exim4) 

The title should be self explanatory but more in detail I'm looking for a way to protect the ldap from LAN brute force attacks. It would be fine to prevent password guessing by locking a password for a specified period of time after repeated authentication failures. It doesn't matter if this can be turned into a DOS. Unfortunately I can't find a way to do this and the documents I've found are really confused. 

I never had experience on that precise model but generally the answer to all your questions is YES for every nas like that. Even the last question should be yes because the nas should be capable to rebuilt the array from the meta information stored in the disk and also because a mirror raid is not that hard to be rebuild. If you extract a running disk you can mount it on another host (the filesystem used by Iomega should be XFS, so every linux can mount it). Bonus question: If I understand well what you mean, the action is SWAP. Hot swap is when you can exctract a disk without turning off the device. This Iomega is not hot swap. Apart this in the recent past (last 3 years) we sold 12 Iomega Storcentre nas. We had 100% warranty emergencies on them: broken disks, bugs in the GUI, broken power units. We stopped to sell Iomega for this reason. I don't mean that this model is affected too but I would suggest you Buffalo $URL$ 

6 subnets. Once thing to note, is that some of the ip address doesn't make any sense. If this image is purely displaying subnets, then, the reason why there is six is because of the routers on the network. So if you count the amount of links between the routers and pc's you get 6. 

Hi Maybe you should try and use another good web server called, lighttpd Read this blog entry: Rate Limiting 

If you bond a active interface you will have a drop in comms to your servers. I would suggest the following, 

This will display the RPMs that is currently installed that provides the ruby binary. Once you have the name of the rpm you can then run the follow to remove the RPM from your system 

If I understood correctly, the network layout is as follows, clients <-wireless-> airport <-eth1-> ubuntu <-eth0-> ISP With this setup you will need to have ip forwarding enabled and have iptables setup correctly to masquerade all the traffic from eth1 to eth0. Eg: 

I just purchased a license of safelyremove. It has command line support. It's very nice. There is a full trial on the website $URL$ 

I can't answer to your question but I want to point on you on a detail that might be interesting: several sata hdd have a jumper to set them sleeping by default (the controller has to send a sata command to wake up the disk. [not all controllers can do that]). Is the jumper already set? Dam 

I just purchased a license of safelyremove. It works with sata controllers too not only with usb. It's very nice. There is a full trial on the website $URL$ 

I'm looking for a 4 ports pci or pci-express (not pci-x) sata controller with these features: - real hot swap support - no RAID support, or with RAID support that can be disabled through the controller bios interface or reflashing the bios My need is to hot plug/unplug one or more different sata1 and/or sata2 disks from different brands size and speed (even at the same time), coming from my customers computers to perform lab activities on them, like backup. I tried several Silicon Image controllers (3112,3114,3124) and Promise TX4. Everyone has issues: some disks are not seen or are dropped during the backup process while the Promise even hangs the host pc with some hard-drives. Adaptec raid (Serveraid 8s) controllers aren't transparent to the operating system and it seems there is noway to disable the raid. What would you suggest? Thank you! 

It can be ip address or dns names, as long as it is resolvable. If you need to use sudo uncomment and change the / Run setup module to extract information from hosts 

Lastly using ulimit on your root account is not recommended, ulimit is mostly used for large multi user environments. I hope this helps! Cheers, =============== 

If so, then you will need to manually remove ruby libs and binaries from your system path. You can locate binary by 

This is the way ulimit works. If you wish to allow one user 4 running processes, you would have 1+4 (one is for the bash process that the user is currently using) From my tests, created a user test, 

I've used both before. I found that using rotatelogs is a very useful tool in managing access logs and if you don't want apache downtime. On a high volume site I would recommend this, the only Issue I found was that if you want to manage the logs you will need to have a separate script cron'd to either clean up or move the logs to a backup server, obviously this depends on the requirement. With logrotate you do have more options with how logfiles are handled, the only issue is when logrotate runs as explained in the previous answer, you will need to restart apache. Basically it all comes down to choice, if you need apache to running without interruptions then rotatelogs with a external cron script to manage, else logrotate will suffice. Just be sure to setup the logrotate cron not to rotate the logs when you have high traffic. Lastly if you want to have apache log to your syslog you can always use the logger command which is on Redhat Based linuxes.
