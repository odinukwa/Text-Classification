You can do this via masking on the cpu if you prefer to not use shaders yet. You'll need these resources: 

You need to create a vector pointing towards the mouse -> Subtract the position of your cannon from the position of your mouse. 

This doesn't support all features of its superclass Array, only enough to be used with Ashleys Family-Assignment-Code, so it's probably very buggy without further editing it! 

i'm working with the Ashley Entity-Component-System (related to libGDX) to program a server-side simulation for an online game and i stumbled upon a serious performance drawback, that is probably caused by how it manages Entity-Sets: "Family", these are basically descriptors for Entities with a specific set of components. Removing a component is an costly operation because the Family-instance needs to search through an Array of entities that it manages and remove the Entity from that Array. This is O(n) for every single removal at worst. And here's my problem: I have a Family that describes all Entities that do have a position and a velocity component. If i want to remove the velocity-component, for example, to turn it into an static entity and re-add it later to make it move again, this completely eats up my budget of frame time (50ms->20fps) with only ~7000 Entities changing Family back and forth within a frame. At the same time, moving 100000 entities takes only about 15ms at max (without multithreading ~30ms). I have thought of these options yet: -Change the data-structure that the Entities are sorted into, this creates new problems, but may still be the most viable Solution, i thought of mapping the Entity IDs to Objects or keeping them in a sorted data-structure. -Sort everything once after a System has finished execution, requires redesigning a lot of code but probably reduces the time-consumption greatly -Changing the Entity System, i know of Artemis, but it would be great if you could point me at something else for Java if you know a library that does it better. -This whole thing may not even become a bottleneck when running the final game-simulation, it might or might not, so just going on and thinking about this later may be acceptable, since I'm probably over-engineering again. What do you think is the way to go? 

Searching for Universities or Art institutes in the U.S, Canada, and Europe Start looking for jobs in those countries and see if you can find anything that suits your experience level. I am assuming that you are looking for mid-level positions, because many companies will not pay for a Visa for entry-level positions. Again, build up your portfolio and practice, practice, and practice. The great thing about development is that you can do this on your own from anywhere in the world. 

As Tim Holt mentioned you will need a PC to run the Unreal Editor to create your content. It also allows you to test your game in an emulator or transfer the content to your iPhone. BUT, to submit your application you will need a Mac. The following documentation page explains all this. Also don't forget that you will need to be a registered iOS developer - meaning pay the $99/year to be able to even test application on your iPhone. This process for Provisioning is explained in the following two documentation pages: 

2. Gliding back and forth You set to a relatively big negative value and decelerate until you move back fast enough. Then you wait for a random amount of time and set to a high positive value until you reach your original speed again, then set it to zero. 3. Reaching your destination You should constrain the randomness of your planes movement based on the time that has elapsed since it was started and the distance to your goal. just initiate the random moves less frequently and try to correct its path towards the target, by tweaking . 4. Constraining the fly area For countering situations in which the plane goes to near to a border, you could use a combination of gliding back and doing a fast loop or a manual turn. 5. Mix it up and time it I can't help you there, you will need to figure out all the tweaking and timing out for yourself. 

If you want it to be fast too, you need to render it with a custom pixel-masking shader, it should be just as simple as this process, if you know how to use shaders, but i do not know how to help you there. Edit: An easy way get this running in an approximated way is to just draw a particle effect at the point of the impact like Felsir suggested, which is also rotated towards the center of the ship (or just center of the texture). You probably won't see a huge difference between this and a masked shield texture, it'll be a lot faster too. 

Since it is most likely that the logic of your game will not change from level to level, rather it is the content that changes - map, characters, enemies - it doesn't make sense to create a new screen for each and every level. Each new level screen will be almost identical to the previous ones except for maybe a few properties, fields, and the Initialization and LoadContent methods. Most of the fields, properties, and methods - such as Draw and Update - will not change. Thus, it makes more sense to have one GameplayScreen and create something like Level and LevelManager classes to handle the switching from one level to another. If you want something even simpler, you can just have a method on the GameplayScreen that switches levels and handles the transition while switching. My recommendation would be to go through the rest of the tutorials on the App Hub site or at least go through some of the labs or kits that actually document the creation of a full games using the Game State Manager. Labs are tutorials that take you through the creation process while kits are full games with lots of comments in the source that you can use as a building block for your own games. The Role-Playing Game Starter Kit uses the Game State Manager and shows one possible level management solution. They create a master Session class that handles the game play and the switching of levels - or in their case switching Maps. Also, this kit uses a number of screens like ChestScreen, DialogueScreen, etc., which will give you a better understanding of what Screens are used for. Also the Platformer Starter Kit is another game that shows how to work with levels, but doesn't use the Game State Manager. But, it wouldn't be hard to integrate their mechanism into a game that uses the Game State Manager. 

You made a simple mistake there, you go through your array, and as soon as the cell you look at does not have the specified item in it, you insert it into that cell or go on if it already has something else in it: 

I would do it like this: If the player wants to go around a corner/change direction, check if the distance he will be able to move in this tick () is bigger than the distance from his center to the connecting blocks center . If true: move him to the center of the connection-block and then move him the remaining distance (speed*delta minus former distance to center) in the direction he wants to turn. This moves him along the to the position the is at. Do all this in one tick. if not: just move him forward. 

So, i figured out how to do it quick and dirty, i subclassed Array (libGDX.util) to allow for faster removal of Entities and then i swapped it with the normal Array inside the Engine class of Ashley: 

Thus, my recommendation would be to start building up your portfolio. If you still want to learn from an educational institution though, I would recommend in no particular order: 

You need to figure out the Visa situation. You need to figure out what Visa you need to accomplish your objectives and whether you are eligible for it. Work Visa's are hard to come by and might have limitations on attending a college on the side. Also, a Student Visa will NOT allow you to work anywhere except for on campus, which means you will not be making much money; there are some exceptions of course, but are hard to come by. This also means that you can't legally do any freelance work online or off while in a different country. This is based on a U.S. Visa, but I believe that most countries might have similar standards, but you should study up on this. Not all companies will be happy to pay for all the Visa paperwork if they know you are intending to switch careers later. I am pointing this out, because you will most likely not get a job in the game industry right off the bat and will have to work somewhere else while you build up your portfolio to get into a game company. 

I assume you know the basic maths stuff concerning angles, movement, distance and all the other stuff. You have these goals: 

You can draw your ship like normal. After drawing the ship, you need to copy the shield textures pixels, which are at a certain distance (a few pixels, maybe 3 or 4) from the impact-point, to your empty texture, and render this edited texture on top of your ship. You should repeat the copying for every impact point, just copy everything to the same texture. This image shows the textures from left to right in the same order as in my list. (the red parts are just to visualize borders and stuff) 

Now you have the total angle that you need to use for you cannon. Keep in mind that you may need to translate from radians to degrees. You may also need to offset the angle by 90 degrees or so depending on where 0 degrees are in your coordinate system. 

It's important, that you set your Sprites height to and you may need to move around your a bit but that shouldn't be that hard. 

Since you are using XNA, there is an easy way to do the above, which can be found in this following thread. In shows how to perform the transformation in 3D or 2D. For 2D, it is as simple as: 

I don't want to be a downer, but I think that before you have learned game development and built up a portfolio, it doesn't really make much sense trying to think about what country has good game companies, because they will most likely not even look at you without proof of experience. As for countries to learn game development, the United States, Canada and Europe have universities or art institutes that provide programs focusing on game development; I don't know any off the top of my head, but you can do a search for them. I don't know if you have thought about it, but I wanted to make sure that you are aware that just moving to another country is not that easy. For someone that has had the privilege of studying and working in the U.S. for around 9 years before moving back to my country - Bahrain - there are a few points I wanted you to be aware of:
