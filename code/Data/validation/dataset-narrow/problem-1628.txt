Unless NOOBS has been changed, this is not possible. (This is due to compression used by Arch.) If you want to run Arch, I suggest you give PINN a try. PINN is derived from NOOBS, and performs similar functions, but has most of the bugs squashed, a vast range of choices of distribution and has a number of additional features to make image maintenance easier. I don't know if this will solve your dongle problem. 

You should certainly should NOT connect the output of a 3.3V linear regulator to the supply rail, but I don't think you were suggesting this. 

There are a lot of old-wives tales about the Pi and power supplies. You definitely will NOT damage the Pi if it runs out of power, whether gradually or suddenly. There is a possibility that the data on the SD Card can be damaged by uncontrolled power down, principally if it is writing at the time, although normal SD Card processes can cause problems if interrupted. (I have 6 Pi and 10 SD Cards, and despite many power failures have not experienced loss.) If you want to be safe it is not difficult to detect low voltage and arrange an orderly shutdown. Unfortunately your comment "Does the voltage start dropping or is it the amperage" indicates little understanding of electrical engineering, but is another of the old-wives tales circulating in Pi circles, which can be remedied by further study. 

You need to learn a little bit more circuit theory!! (This also applies to many more on this site). You need a good regulated supply (PSU) that will supply the rated 5v ±5% at 1A. There is no merit is using a PSU "rated" at more than 1A. (This should be proper supply - not a phone "charger" - many of which have poor regulation). Internally the Pi regulates this down to 3.3v for most of its internal circuitry (as mentioned by @ppumkin). Supplying a higher input voltage will just overheat this regulator. The excess current (1A less that used by the Pi) is used for HDMI, USB and GPIO power pins. This is limited to about 300mA (1A less ~700mA) by the on-board polyfuse. If you need more for externals, you can use a powered hub (USB) and/or provide a separate source to the externals (which only need a common ground). There should be plenty of power for running the on-board peripherals, including the camera, although you should avoid drawing extra current via GPIO pin 1. You can of course use a PSU rated at a higher current, provided you bypass the polyfuse, either by supplying 5V to GPIO pin 2 (although there are many other access points), bypassing the polyfuse, or simply feeding in through the full size USB ports. 

There is no doubt that operation is illegal. Regulations vary around the world, but in most countries operating unlicensed radio transmitters is illegal. In many places it is OK to operate low power equipment which is approved under a . WiFi and radio microphones fall into these categories. CB radio and model control are also legal, even though using higher power, but only in approved bands. There is no way Pifm would qualify, because of the out of band emissions. Having said this, the chances of being caught and prosecuted is low. 

Under you may need to install to enable writing to NTFS I have added a typical drive entry. NOTE I invariably manually mount, rather than automount. 

Run and post the result. I do not know what the channels are in Germany, but channel 12 is not supported in some jurisdictions. 

To answer the question you asked; Yes it is possible. Raspbian and Ubuntu are not TOO dificult, if you have a Linux machine. NOOBS is quite difficult. I think iOS just adds another level of difficulty. I strongly suggest you borrow a monitor and keyboard for initial setup. Rather than suggesting the many options (which you will find discussed on this site) you need to specify what you have. 

The next (recommended) step is to install which enables you to launch the Xorg Display Server from the command line (with ) 

Will show packages which mention VNC, and you then use to explore e.g. There is already a VNC package installed by default, although IMO it is not the most flexible. You will find hundreds of posts on this site tagged [vnc] 

As I understand from your question (which is vague and incomplete) you are trying to use a Windows machine to provide ICS to the Pi. This would be OK, but you can't then use the same connection to connect to the Pi. You can have one or the other. (This is not strictly true, advanced configuration on the ICS machine may be possible, but this is NOT a Pi question.) 

This fixes the problem and appears to have little impact. The and are also dependent on the system clock. 

The Xbee is designed for baud rates of 250 kbit/s. I have been using serial communications for over 50 years. The No. 1 rule for reliable communication, over any medium, is to use the LOWEST rate you actually NEED. 

You should probably be using sockets to communicate. The pigpio library has socket interfaces to GPIO and has plenty of examples. Your question is too general to give a more specific answer. 

will put it back to the latest supported kernel/bootcode. PS The current supported kernel is 4.14.34 PPS The recommended kernel/bootcode upgrade also cleans up the modules, and does not leave a trail of obsolete modules like rpi-update 

See Electrical Specifications of GPIO NOTE Comments about limiting current are wrong! The GPIO are high impedance, and will draw no current, but to protect against damage caused by setting GPIO to output you should use a series resistor from voltage divider to GPIO. This should be ~1kΩ; this is normally unnecessary with a voltage divider, but is a good idea for a low impedance circuit, and certainly does no harm. 

The above uses which is the best method as it works on different networks. You can reserve IP in your router if you want consistent IP addresses. If you want you can use IP, but you cannot assign the same IP to multiple interfaces, each needs a distinct IP. 

is a Link-local address. If you have DIRECTLY connected to your PC there is NO network connection. You can talk to the PC (and vice versa). You CAN enable ICS which SHOULD provide an IP address, but this is a Windows question. 

It is almost certain that the Pi's address is NOT , as this is most likely the gateway. You can check this by typing (in a terminal on the Mac). If the Mac (is it yours or shared) has installed would show all the active addresses on your network. 

There may be a way of setting a null password, but I suggest you create a public key, and install in your Pi. 

The Pi3 only has support for HID and Audio services, so you can NOT use Bluetooth. "Bluetooth support is limited at this stage; you can pair with pretty much anything, but you can only usefully connect to devices which support either the Human Interface Device or Audio Sink services – in other words, mice, keyboards and other UI devices, and speakers and headsets." $URL$ 

It depends on exactly what you want to do. It is relatively easy to measure small (~1V) +ve voltages RELATIVE TO THE PI GROUND. Any ADC can do this, depending on the precision required. Higher voltages can be measured with appropriate voltage dividers (which is what multimeters do internally). I have done this with ADC and also using the analog inputs of an . If you go the latter either an or may be an easier solution. Measuring -ve voltages requires additional circuitry, and a -ve supply voltage. Floating measurements (voltage or resistance) are harder, and you would be better to go for an external data logger module, with its own supply, which can float WRT the Pi, and use a serial protocol to log the data. 

Yes. In fact this is normal engineering practice, although for the Pi it probably makes no difference as the outputs are symmetrical. Having said that the amount of current you can supply from 3.3V is limited. 

mount only shows mounted on The directory has 2 sub-directories and which could be used as . How are you mounting the drive? The GUI mounts in , and creates mount points, so it may have created a few. Unless you want transient mounts (in the GUI) you may be better to create an entry in . If so list this, and we can help. 

Goldilocks has given an answer which should let you get a result. You should paste your partition layout (output of ) for a specific answer. This is not how images are normally made, but you could make a script to create a new minimal image by copying from existing. Unfortunately is not particularly easy to script, but if you want to go this way I could post a sample I have used for manipulating images (I would have to hunt for it). 

The RTC seems to use the I2C interface which requires the secondary functions on pins 3,5. (You could use the I2C on P5, but this would obviously require modifying the RTC software.) There seems to be no reason why you could not use any of the other GPIO pins for the existing functions, although this would require minor changes to the software. Incidentally there is no need for the 10KΩ pullup in your existing circuit as pins 3,5 already have 1.8KΩ pullups. 

You can (and indeed SHOULD) connect the Gnd (pin 6) together if the Pi are to be interconnected for any reason. Connecting pin 5 (SCL) of multiple Pi is a BAD idea. The pin is used for many purposes, usually output, and connecting multiple outputs together is always a bad idea, compounded in this case because each Pi has a 1.8kΩ pullup. If you really wanted to do this you could isolate each Pi with a diode, which would allow the pin to be pulled low without interfering with normal operation. NOTE the tutorial you linked is obsolete, and recent Raspbian have shutdown functionality inbuilt , so NO code is required. See Raspberry Pi 3 model B "dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown" Also all the modern Pi have pins (which are actually Reset pins), which are a far better candidate for restarting - but this is independent of shutdown function. 

You cannot run Virtualbox on the Pi because it is only available for i386 and amd64 and will not run on the Pi CPU. 

The simple answer is that FAT does not support users, or any other Linux attributes or permissions. The best it can do is inherit the permissions of the mount point. OBVIOUSLY the drive needs to be mounted! I am not sure if it even makes sense to try to extract Wordpress files to FAT. AFAIK these are just and so probably nothing special is required. I don't currently have easy access to a Wordpress installation.
