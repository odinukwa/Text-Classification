I think you will find it hard to find a linux based mirror of your Exchange solution, if not impossible (unless you excel in nix based OS) If you have any questions let me know, I am happy to help you where I can. UPDATE I have just re-read your question, I assumed you are using SBS2003. Could you please confirm your Server OS? If you are not using SBS2003 you should be able to add another mailbox store and migrate your heavy users over to it. 

Your problem is that Telnet is not installed by default on Server 2008 machines. (Or Windows 7 for that matter). To resolve you will need to open up Server Manager and enable Telnet Client as a feature. If you need any more help please let me know. 

open Exchange Management Console Expand Recipient Configuration Click Mailbox Right Click the User and "Manager Full Access Permission" Click add, find the user and hit OK, then click manage and finsih. 

I've just ordered Postini for a friend's business and like an idiot I have added the secondary email address with the wrong extention .co.uk rather than .com. I have got the credentials through for the server but it wont let me access the system, I've attempted to use the password reset but that either dosnt do anything or send the reset email to the secondary email account which I put in incorrectly. My question is have any of you dealt with Google/Postini before or are you maybe a reseller of the service that could help me out? I have posted on the Support forums but so far its two days without response and 4emails later without response! To sum up, I've ordered the service, paid for it but cannot access the system to configure it at all! EDIT: I understand that Google Reseller's have the ability to bump my support request and escalted it, if there is anyone out there I'd appreciate some help as I have the Google Support Reference number :) Can anyone help? Many thanks in advance. 

This can then be added to the users logon script path, provided the file is placed in the servers Netlogon folder. EDIT I have just re-read your question. Obviously my method is not practicle if you wish to change many shares. Could you advise if many shares are required to be changed? Hope this helps, any questions let me know. 

I see that you have to option to accomplish the above. Setup port forwarding for example: Server A - hosted websites on Port 80 Server B - hosted websites on Port 80 You can use incoming traffic on port 80 and direct it to Server A on port 80 AND use port 81 for incoming traffic and direct it to Server B on port 80 (This is the most simple and cheapest way to do this!) Depending on the capability of your Router and how much you can spend, you could obtain multiple external IP address' and assign each IP address port forwards. ie xxx.xxx.xxx.1 points to Server A and xxx.xxx.xxx.2 points to Server B. The obvious benefit to the second option is that ports can remain the same and depending on which IP address the domain/subdomain is requested your router can handle the request and Route/NAT to the correct server on the correct port. I hope that makes as much sense on text as it does in my head. If you have any questions let me know and I'll do my best to explain it better! 

rather than trusting the application you have menetioned, lets investigate for ourselves. Please open up a command prompt and enter the following command: 

HI, Where is your domain's DNS hosted? If you do a NSlookup on your domain external to your network where does it say your Name servers and MX records Point to? When did you last make changes to your MX records? INITIAL VIEW It sounds like you have set your MX records internally on your server, we need to confirm your domain name is registered, is connected to a global name server and you have set your MX record correctly. 

The problem you are experiecning is 100% caused by your enternal IP Address being in a dynamic range. Through no fault of your own as noted in the comments of the above answers your IP block is listed on several black lists. - Please dont attempt/waste your time trying to have your IP removed as A - The blacklist will problerly denie your request B - Your IP will likely change weekly/after a powercut/after your lease runs out. You do however have two choices to resolve this problem. 

The SSL Certificate option which your looking for is called SAN (Subject Alternative Names) It will allow you to add the local hostname alongside the external url. You can pick them up from Globalsign and is asked as part of the certificate request. I hope this helps you. 

I think either of this will resolve your problem. Let me know if they dont. One last thing confirm that both machines are looking at the same DNS servers, again in a command prompt type IPCONFIG /ALL and make a note of the primary and secondary DNS servers. Hope this helps. 

The short answer is: Yes you can. The item you need to look for is Subject Alternative Names (SANs) you can purchase one of these from VeriSign, from 1-3years. Hope this helps you! 

Repair your network adapter (let me know if you need me to tell you how this is done) In a command prompt on the XP machine type ipconfig /flush dns. 

The secretaries will be able to send to the list provided they are sending as the manager. They should not be able to send messages to the Distrubtion list otherwise! I hope this helps you out. 

One option you could use would be to select the top level folder (if possible) right click > properties > security tab > advanced > remove the option the inherit permissions and remove all entries and add your new username > owner tab > set yourself as the owner > hit apply and wait. All being well this should resolve your problem. 

You could look into using WSUS, combining it with group policy to force your update settings onto your servers. Please see the following website as it has quite helpful information: $URL$ 

If you are looking for a beginning into the world of Windows Server, it may be worth looking at Microsoft's small buisness server. It provides: Domain Controller, DHCP/DNS, File serving, Exchange (Microsoft's Email Server) and much more all under one package. - The OS is heavily wizzard driven to make tasks simpler. I'm a windows server tech so I couldnt tell you too much about *nix systems. Hope this helps some. 

The problem will lie with your DNS server having old/outdated DNS entries - try checking them on the DNS server.
