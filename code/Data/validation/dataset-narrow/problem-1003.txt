The rest is cmd If you don't have a C# compiler I've included a link here to a.cs (the source code above) a.exe and since chrome tries to block any exe, you could download a.ex2 and rename it. Or when Chrome tries to block the exe then say "dismiss" and go to downloads within chrome and say recover file. But however you want to do it, you can get that EXE. Maybe visual studio express (like a free small version of visual studio) will have csc.exe letting you compile it, if you want to do it that way. $URL$ Once you have that little program then you can do this in cmd 

I think overheating is very likely, if as you say, it shuts down then doesn't turn on straight away(it could be cooling down). I have heard of that as a symptom or possible symptom of a system overheating and may have encountered it myself once or twice. Typical candidate for overheating would be CPU. Run speedfan, and see if you see a Temp go up and up and reach a certain point, then the computers shuts off!! or touch the heatsink and see if it is too hot to touch.. ! (the inside of a computer won't kill you.. it's DC and not high voltage. Though many might turn a computer off before doing so.. it's fine.. i've done it! You may want to take precautions for static. Some people worry about that. 

top keyboard On the keyboard that has only a INS/Num lock key (the top pic). That keyboard has only one insert key - that one. I don't see any purpose to the num lock key on that one as it has no number pad. But, the num lock won't/doesn't affect whether or not that insert key toggles overwrite. I mistakenly thought insert was reached with shift. But no, insert while written at the top of the key, is not reached with shift. On any computer, hitting Shift+Insert, in wordpad, will paste. The solution was to not hit shift. I didn't know that at the time and so at the time, I similarly, I didn't realise I was doing shift+insert at the time. (I thought I was hitting shift to reach insert). Hitting the Fn key with that key would toggle Num Lock. And num lock only affects the insert key on the number pad, of which that key is not it. bottom keyboard On the keyboard in the bottom picture, there are two insert keys. One in the top row and one in the number pad. The one in the top row, is like the key on the keyboard in the top picture. (except that Fn + that key does print screen rather than num lock). The other insert key on that keyboard, is in the number pad, and num lock affects that one. so, both insert keys are fine, just don't hold shift. and obviously if an insert key is printing 0s then it's a num lock issue but that wasn't the case with me. So if a key has a white symbol and a blue symbol, then no shift key is used even if one symbol is above the other. If it has as I can see.. two white symbols and one blue, and the white symbols are one above the other, then of course, use shift for the white symbols. 

The following is a guide on how to setup Pyinstaller on a Windows system when, due to firewall restrictions, you are not able to install it using pip... Normally you would just install Pyinstaller with like so: 

....and you will not run into all the error messages and find will be able to search through your entire file system for any directories containing valgrind. 

I'm not aware of any way of setting the IPv4 settings for a specific network only as opposed to a specific adapter, but I would suggest another approach for you particular situation. Windows allows you to set an Alternate Configuration for when no DHCP server is found. By default it is set to automatically give you an address in the through range when no DHCP server is found. You can change this default to specifc IPv4 settings of your choosing; in your case, your phone's wireless configuration. To do so, do the following: 

Edit: I would like to add that this solution does not meet one provision in OP's original question/request; namely, it does not keep the URL autocomplete data. The purple visited links are tied directly to the browser history, so by clearing that it does reset the links back to blue as if they were not visited. Unfortunately it also clears the same history that the URL autocomplete is tied to. 

Click on the File tab at the top Choose Options Choose Advanced Go to the General tab Scroll down until you see an option called Ignore other applications that use Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). Currently this box is check. You want to uncheck it. Click OK to get out of that menu and you're done. You will be able to open your Excel file now. 

A shell builtin will return no folder path to an executable when you run the command. Here are example outputs of both commands on my system: 

yes there is a little board you can get that converts SATA to IDE. (what people call IDE is technically ATA, specifically, PATA) and if you google for SATA to IDE adaptor you see a picture of a little board with a SATA connector and an IDE connector. Any cable it comes with is not what does the conversion so is not a conversion cable. They are very cheap, like $10. As for your question about cables, there isn't really an issue. There's no special cable. You need a SATA cable to plug your drive into one of these adaptors just as you would normally plug it into a motherboard. You can get one that has a SATA cable or one that has it separately. Some of the little boards have a male IDE connector like a motherboard has, and like the back of a PATA hard drive has. And you need an IDE cable, these are Females both sides, and plug the thing in. Other adaptor boards have a female connector on the adaptor board and you plug the hard drive in directly. Some of the little boards are one way. (IDE to SATA. Or, SATA to IDE). Some are bidirectional, and have places one can plug the SATA cable - one for SATA to IDE, one for IDE to SATA. You obviously want a SATA to IDE one. Or a bidirectional one. Though a bidirectional one isn't as cheap. On Amazon, I see SATA cable for a dollar. A bidirectional adaptor for $7. A one way one for $0.40 In some cases, links saying people that bought this bought this. So why you're worrying about the cost I have no idea. I guess you didn't google for an adaptor and see the prices, and you weren't able to guess that an adaptor wouldn't be expensive. 

You'll find a lot of these sites with the names of popular sites (like github in your case) but using the .cm domain instead of .com From Wikipedia: 

When you navigate to that directory you will see a lot of files that don't look like picture files, as seen in the following screenshot: 

It was necessary in the particular case of the person who answered OP's question in the link you provided because he had a Windows 7 bootable USB with MBR and his PC was initially set to UEFI. So when first entering the BIOS, his USB stick wasn't even recognized/listed in the boot options. So the first time he booted up and pressed F2 to enter the BIOS, he had to change it to Legacy boot mode. He then had to save and exit the BIOS, the PC rebooted, and then he had to press F2 to enter the BIOS once again. Now his Windows 7 bootable USB drive was recognized in the BIOS and he could then move it up in the boot order. I'm not saying that's necessarily going to be the case with you trying to boot into your AVG rescue disk because I don't know how you currently have your PC setup or how you created that rescue disk, but your main question seems to be why the two step process was necessary in that particular case and I am just clarifying why that person had to do it. 

does not require that you SSH to the remote computer in order to make the copy (and this is where you're currently running into trouble with your command). scp essentially works in either a push or pull fashion. You can push files/folders from your local PC to a remote. The command syntax for this method is as follows: 

Click the Start Menu and type and hit Enter Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER > Software > Microsoft > Windows > CurrentVersion > Policies > Attachments With Attachments selected look in the right window pane for a DWORD Value called SaveZoneInformation, double-click it and enter a value of 1 (if the Attachments key does not exist, and there's a good chance it won't, go to the next step). 3a. If you do not see the Attachments key in Policies, do the following: right-click on Policies and select New and then select Key. Name this key Attachments. Now right-click on Attachments and select New and then select DWORD (32-bit) Value. Name this value SaveZoneInformation. Now double-click SaveZoneInformation and set its value to 1. Now reboot your PC or log off Windows and log back in for the change to take effect. 

There is an extension called Quicktabs, and an extension called Tab Menu. Both are good. Tab menu is a bit harder to find, but here it is mentioned on chromeplugins forum which has a link to it on mediafire and there's a link to it on ge.tt Here is quicktabs on chrome extensions site- quicktabs it has a search which is good. you can of course install both. And to install Tab Menu, since it isn't on the chrome extensions site, but we have the crx file(the actual installation file), so you can drag the CRX file into tools..extensions and install it that way. 

This might be what you want A batch file dealt with this surprisingly neatly! Where is your data file blahblah.bat is a one line batch file 

further addition I accept the answer from rik and the great contributions from dan, that came in the discussion. I would note though that when I remove that RequireAdmin line from the top, I get no response in the non-administrative or administrative cmd prompt. But it's not important. Both rik and dan got the same error response. 

This guy demonstrating one, is plugging it into a 3.5" drive. So i'd expect devices that look like that to be 3.5" IDE, but adapting between 2.5" to 3.5" is a common thing, though I haven't done it in this context. and bear in mind you'd be going the other way completely, with the IDE side towards the motherboard, and with a SATA hard drive connected to this adapter with a SATA cable. (I only point to that picture to demonstrate that it's a 3.5" adapter and how it is powered and what the power is and isn't for) 

you could try displaying who the owner is (dir /q). Also try logging in as Administrator, and changing ownership to Administrator(google taking ownership). Can you then still not set Everyone to have write access? you can also try Process Explorer, and see what process if any, is locking the file and end the process. Sometimes(I think in the case of svchost.exe) you can move the mouse over that process in process explorer and see a particular service and stop that and delete the file. if you are desperate and give up doing it properly, you could try a program called unlocker. Or a form of Win XP PE(a Win XP "Live CD" so to speak) like Bart's or UBCD. 

Plug your computer into your TV. Requires S-Video, VGA, DVI or HDMI output from your computer and the same input from your TV. (Avoid S-Video if possible--it only pumps 480p). If you've got an iPod that plays video, you can buy a ridiculously expensive cable from Apple to hook your iPod up to your TV. 

Assuming you are running Windows, Microsoft provides a solution that allows you to create your own custom keyboard layout which can subsequently be accessed via the language bar. 

Using Gimp, you can further refine the selection using Select -> Feather. I generally use the wand tool to select the white background, Select -> Grow Selection by 1 pixel, Feather by 2 pixels, and then remove the background. 

So, you should be fine as long as you buy the same speed RAM. However, you may want to check your motherboard manual, as there are sometimes other restrictions on what types of RAM you can use. 

I haven't found anything special I've done to bypass the Welcome Screen on my own box (which has bypassed it by default since I installed it), so removing your password should do the trick. I would suggest going ahead and restarting--you've likely already solved the problem. 

Nope, you can archive copies of your TV shows or movies to a DVD using iTunes' included library backup feature, but they will not be viewable on DVD players. You'll find that iTunes TV shows and movies include DRMs that will prevent you from playing them using most devices, though you do have a couple of options. 

I've not been able to dig up anything that fixes the audio issue within the hub, but I have found several products such as this, which function as USB sound cards. Perhaps you could pick up a USB hub with six ports and purchase one of those to go with it? 

There are 3 similar commands you can try, and it looks like you tried one already. netsh winsock reset netsh int reset netsh int ip reset try the browsers after that, though would probably need a restart after that. may not work, but worth a try. 

you vould try easeus $URL$ and $URL$ i'd imagine these attempts they do are read only so shouldn't prevent further attempts with other software. You could also try using labels next time to help avoid accidentally deleting a partition. And it's good if the program that you delete partitions with, also shows you the data on the partition, though many don't so the clearest identifier in those cases is a label. 

And that's not just the defaults, that's all you can set them to too. Those are the 3 private IP ranges. As specified by RFC 1918 Now, as far as what is common. That could change in future. But from what i've seen, the 192.168/16 range is most common. Second to that is the 10/8 range. I've seen that too, as you have. It's not uncommon And I've never seen a router set to use anything on 172.16/12 but they could. 

then you have both the ability to switch between your computers, but to do so seated at a distance from them. FYI- There are other variations of KVM that are useful. A Reverse KVM switch, lets you have multiple 'consoles' (keyboard and mice and video/monitor) and one computer. So you could sit at location A or B or C, to access a computer at location C. And for your further info, another called synergy works as software, lets you have one Keyboard Mouse , multiple Computer, multiple monitors. I used it years ago. And windows lets you have one KMC multiple V. 

ok it clearly worked since we have 3 distinct directories, but let's try to get some kind of further proof
