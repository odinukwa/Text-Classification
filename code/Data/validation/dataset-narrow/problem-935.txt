I did have some issues with the tab space in the finished TOC. Manually reapplying the TOC1 paragraph style to all the entries for part headings sorted this out though. If you want the page numbers to be separated from the heading text by a simple space instead of a tab space, in step 3 of the first procedure, press the spacebar instead of Tab. Then, in the Table of Contents dialog box, clear the Right align page numbers check box. You'll end up with something like this: 

If, as I suspect, you want the autonumbering included in your appendix and easily updatable, but you don't want page numbers included, try this instead of the index approach that Wes suggests. Like that approach, it has the virtue of not requiring VBA. At the location where you want the appendix, insert a custom table of contents that is based on just the paragraph style that you're using for requirements, and that excludes page numbers. In the Table of Contents dialog box, clear the Show page numbers check box, click Options, and then, in the list of styles, clear the numbers out of all the fields, and enter an appropriate TOC level in the field for whatever paragraph style you used for your requirement paragraphs). This way, if you add, delete, or remove requirement paragraphs, a simple update of the TOC will automatically update the numbering. 

You now have to insert a custom TOC where the entries for the part headings are generated by using your fields and the entries for the other headings are generated by using styles. 

Select the text that needs to be repeated, and insert a bookmark (on the Insert tab, in the Links group, click Bookmark). At each place where you need the text repeated, insert a field (on the Insert tab, in the Text group, click Quick Parts > Field, select Ref, and then select the name of the bookmark in the list). After you change the bookmarked text, select the whole document, and then press F9 to update the fields. 

Then, on the Borders tab, I select the same light blue color as the border color and select 6 pt as the border width. 

Alternatively (and again, just as for tracked changes), you can click Reviewing Pane in the Tracking group to open a pane that shows a list of the differences and lets you jump to individual differences by clicking them. 

You can use field codes to generate the TOC. Actually, from your first image, it appears that your heading 1s ('Animals' and 'Things') are already correct, so you can save some manual steps and use a combination of field codes (for levels 2–5) and styles/outline levels (for level 1). First, add fields to the various headings and list items that should appear in the TOC. 

In one of the documents ('document A'), select the text of the first redundant step. I generally prefer to select just the text content of the paragraph, omitting the ¶ mark at the end. (If necessary, make paragraph marks visible by pressing Ctrl+*.) Then, on the Insert tab, in the Links group, click Bookmark to insert a bookmark. It's a good idea to make a note of your bookmark names (for example, copy and paste them into a Notepad file), because you'll have to enter them manually later. If the steps in several consecutive paragraphs will be redundant, select all of them at once (I omit the ¶ mark at the end of the last step in the group). Insert a bookmark for that group of steps. Repeat step 1 until all the redundant steps and/or groups of steps are bookmarked. In the other document ('document B'), insert a blank paragraph where you want to insert a redundant step or group of steps from document A. Use one of these methods to insert the text of the step or group of steps as an field: 

You can use and fields. At the beginning of the document, insert a series of field, one for every bit of information that you need to reuse – for example: 

Update: Here's an example. If the paper size is US letter, the total page height is 11" = 792 pt. If the top and bottom margins are 1" (= 72 pt) each, the height of the text area is 792 – (72 × 2) = 648 pt. If the font size is 11 pt, double line space is (nominally) 22 pt. See how many 22-pt lines will fit in the text area: 648 ÷ 22 = 29.45454545... Remove the remainder, and find out how much space exactly 29 lines of text require: 22 × 29 = 638 pt. Therefore, if you have 29 lines spaced at 22 pt, you'll have 10 pt of extra space to deal with (648 – 638; corresponding to the .45454545 remainder above). So increase the top margin by 10, to 82 pt. If the font size is 12 pt, double space is (nominally) 24 pt. See how many 24-pt lines will fit in the text area: 648 ÷ 24 = 27 In this case (or if you use 11-pt font with 24-pt line spacing), no further adjustment is needed. If you set the Line spacing property to Exactly at 24 pt, exactly 27 lines of text will fit on each page. For headings, and other elements, just make sure that the line spacing and any space above/below work within the 22-pt or 24-pt grid that you've established. 

Just press Enter to create a new paragraph as usual, but then clear the numbering that's automatically inserted by either clicking Numbering in the Paragraph group on the Home tab of the ribbon or pressing Backspace. Then, for your example, because you want the paragraph aligned with the text in 1.a instead of the text in 1.a.iii, click Decrease Indent in the Paragraph group to adjust the indent. 

Finally, if you're proficient in Word fields, you can use fields inside the field to automatically pull in the part number and title instead of manually typing them. That way, once you've set up the field for the first part heading, you can just copy and paste it for all the others. In this case, however, the field can't be in the same paragraph as the heading itself; it has to be somewhere after it. For example, I used the Heading 1 style for part headings and ended up with this: 

Then just draw in horizontal lines between the paragraphs that you want to split into rows. Word will break the single cell into multiple rows. Note, however, that the Draw Table tool is a bit fussy. If you don't draw the line in just the right place between paragraphs, you end up with extra rows or rows inserted between paragraphs other than the ones that you intended. Tip: I always find that I need to basically draw right through the middle of the text in each paragraph to get the tool to work the way I want. So, to get the table to divide between paragraphs 1 and 2, draw through the middle of the line of text in paragraph 1. Then draw through the middle of the text in paragraph 2 to divide the table between paragraphs 2 and 3, and so on. You'll probably also end up with extra space at the bottom of the last row, as shown below. In this case, just drag the bottom border upward until the extra space disappears. (Be sure to turn off the Draw Table tool first, either by clicking the button again or by pressing Esc.) 

Insert bookmarks in A and B to mark out the various chunks. Select all the text for one chunk in one file, and then, on the Insert tab, in the Links group, click Bookmark, and enter a name for the bookmark. Repeat for all other chunks that you need to break A and B into. In C, follow the steps for the second option above, but when you're selecting the file to insert as a link, click Range, and then enter the name of the bookmark for the first chunk. Repeat for every other chunk that you need to include for each file. 

In both the second and third methods, enclose the file name in quotation marks if it contains spaces, and enter the full path of the file if it's in a different directory than main.docx. For example, sub.docx is in the same directory as main.docx, and I want to insert the section that contains the results of benchmark testing. In sub.docx, I have added a bookmark named BenchmarkResults around the relevant text. In this case, my field code will look like this: 

The first bit after is the name of the bookmark that will be generated to store the information. The second bit, in quotation marks, will appear as text in the dialog box that prompts for the information. (Note: For each field that you need, press Ctrl+F9, and then type the field information between the braces () that are generated. Don't simply type a set of braces. Alternatively, on the Insert tab, in the Text group, click Quick Parts > Field, select Ask, and then type the prompt text and a bookmark name in the appropriate fields.) Then, at each place in the document where you need the stored info to be filled in, insert a field – for example: 

You can't, really. What you can do, though, is create a custom table of contents that has 5 levels, select it, and then click Table of Contents > Save Selection to the Table of Contents Gallery. That way, the 5-level TOC will at least be available as an option in new documents that you create, so you won't have to re-create it each time. 

For my example, I added the static text 'Note:', in bold, to Word's built-in Block Text paragraph style. 

This is done on the Design tab (not the Table Tools > Design tab that appears when the focus is on the table, but the main Design tab next to the Insert tab). On the Design tab, click Colors > Customize Colors, and modify the various Accent colors. 

On the Insert tab, in the Text group, click the Date & Time button. In the dialog box, select the format that includes seconds, and then click Set As Default. Then, the next time you have to insert the time, you just have to click Date & Time, and then click OK or press Enter. Pretty quick and doesn't require a macro. 

As came up in another recent question, it helps if you make bookmarks visible if they aren't (click File > Options > Advanced, and then, under Show document content, select Show bookmarks). Otherwise, when you change the text, some of the new text might end up outside the bookmark, and your changes won't be propagated. When the bookmarks are visible, you can see whether all the new text is correctly inside the bookmark.
