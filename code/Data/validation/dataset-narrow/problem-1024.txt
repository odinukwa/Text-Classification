An ISO is a packed archive image (imagine it like a RAR or ZIP file) that contains more files. Is not enough to copy the ISO file in a CD/DVD then burn it, you should load the contents of the ISO using your favorite DVD burning software, search for an option that says something like "open/load ISO" in your burner software. In case of an ISO which contains an operating system installer it also contains the capabilities to make the media bootable, this means you shouldn't edit or extract the ISO by yourself to copy/burn its contents, let your burner software do that job by loading the ISO in its natural way. 

For example with the usage of a third party application which informs you about the general computer activity, such as LastActivityView of Nirsoft. $URL$ 

Research In this article I seen a natural methodology or hack to hide or disable any contextmenu item: 

I would like to ask for advanced users in Windows debugging to help me debug what is happening when the user do right-click on a taskbar icon to discover what is the cause of the missing context-menu. I don't know if maybe apps like Process Monitor from SysInternals or Spy Studio from Nektra could help me to discover and fix the issue by examining windows calls and events, I need orientation in this way or someone who could do it for me. Or I ask for what files or packages or registry values or dependencies in general are required to that contextmenu to be shown, then knowing that maybe I could restore/copy the missing things from a working O.S. to the non-working O.S.. Please note that I could try any thing with any risk of O.S. corruption because I work with snapshots in the V.M. that I can restore to a previous O.S. state if a possible solution fails. RESEARCH 

...and it seems imposible to disable it in a natural way. This bug, or better said this annonying design decission its very frustrating for the user experience because in short words now a Windows 10 user can't keep a personalizaed order of the position of the Explorer windows, because if we close one, when we reopen the same window or open a new one its coordinates will be different to produce the annonying cascade view. In this video I demonstrate this problem taken to the extreme: $URL$ 

At this point, knowing that In Windows 10 the real border width is 8 px, but only 1 px. is shown, and the rest of the border is just... invisible, I would like to ask for a possible solution to turn visible the border in Windows 10, I mean to have a real window border like in previous Windows versions, with a border image resource that fills the entire border width, NOT an invisible border. I'm aware this question probablly needs advanced knowledges, further investigation and personal testing, because Google's result pages will not show anyone how to solve this issue, all the people talk and discuss about this 1 px. border issue, but no body seems to know a solution, and worst than that, Microsoft seems is not listenning to anyone and to the reasonable design of a "window". I must say that I have an application named Windows Style Builder (for Windows 10 version), which is able to open a .msstyle theme file to edit any image resource contained in the theme, that program was the only hope I found to try find and make greater the border image resource to fill the entire real border width, however I tried to make bigger all the border image resources used in Aero theme, but Windows 10 remains showing a 1 px. border, seems no matter how much big is the border image resource used to show the border by the theme, seems the displayed border width is not controlled by the theme itself (I don't really know), so my nightmare is to think that seems a person with reversal engineering knowledges to create a kind of home-made patch to apply to who knows which executable or windows resource could be required to solve this annonying issue of Windows 10, I really hope this thing could be solved in a more friendlly way. I don't know what more to investigate and to try by myself. REQUISITES 

Only default installation of Visual Studio consumes 5Gb (or whatever other default required space for other Visual Studio version). One alternative you could try, is to perform a Visual Studio installation with selective default and hidden components, some of them, like Blend and/or SQL components occupies too much space, and maybe you don't need it for your purposes to reduct the required freespace, however, this will not ensure you could install Visual Studio at all even with the minimal components installed, because the freespace you have is very, very small. I recommend you to perform a full analysis on which applications installed on your system you can uninstall, a default installation of Windows occupies more or less 12 GB, so you have increased the space some Gigabytes, maybe by installing updates (that you can uninstall or also remove its backups to reduct size) or by applicatiosn that you installed (which can be uninstalled), also, perform some cleaning with CCLEANER, and after all that, try what I commented above about doing a selective installation of Visual Studio: 

Yes, of course is possible, the only thing you should care is about the hardware configuration of the virtual machine (memory, cpu, connected dispositives, etc) that always can be configured to meet the limitations of another PC. The Virtual Machines are stored in the specified folder, by default if I remember good. You can copy an entire folder containing a Virtual Machine to other location (to another PC), then import the virtual machine through the VMWare Player user-interface or just doing double-click on the file that ends with ".vmx" extension, then VMWare Player will ask you if you moved or copied the virtual machine, really no matter what you choose if you only have one "copy" of that virtual machine. 

I'm under Windows 8 x64, it's a custom installation where I've removed the windows text-to-speech engine and male/female TTS voices that were implemented in the DVD to clean-up a big space, but now just I need to let my PC speak some text that I have written in a textfile and using an English female voice, but I'm totally lost 'cause I don't have the text speech engine, I need help. First of all I've tried to use e-speak application and other free apps from sourceforge site but as I was supposed those applications are based and depends on the windows speech engine TTS. Then Secondly I've tried to download and install the Speech SDK 5.1 just wondering that maybe this package could recover the necesary files that I need to speak text, but didn't. Seems that the original Windows Speech Engine are not distributed over the web by Microsoft as a single package like other features that could be downloaded ( ex: .net framework ), or at least I can't find any related package to try to recover/install the windows speech support to speak text. So... what alternatives I have without re-installing an untouched Windows? really I won't, I just need to speak some text in this specific case and never more I should need this feature installed in my Windows... Maybe some applications such as Dragon Naturally Speaking comes with their own engine and TTS and that could solve my problem? 

However, as for the (bad-design) "rules" of Windows 10, if the user tries to reproduce the same registry trick in this O.S, nothing will change in the window aspect, you'll end up with a geater border, yes, but remember that only 1 px. of that border will be visible, so you'll end up having a damn 1 px. visible border with a big and annonying invisible resize handle. This poor, bad, unfriendlly, and horrible design decission of Microsoft is a fact, as is also a fact that exists much users who loves this 1 px. border aspect, their oppinion is respetable, however, honestlly those users only fix their oppinion on the O.S. aspect, they don't notice the wrong behavior that 1 px. border can cause to they, whch will break the end-user productivity and comfortableness, even just with simple things like trying to move a Window, or trying to difference which window is over to other, because the border of all windows are invisible. This issue has been discussed over "all" the Internet forums related to Windows 10 personalization, here is a simple but never-ending discussion topic on a Microsoft Community thread for your interest: 

I've been customizing a Windows 10 TH2 ISO image using the WinToolkit application, and manually using DISM to remove features and packages from the mounted Install.wim image, I also removed from the WinSXS directory specific unrequired files for my needs on which I'm not interested and are safe to be removed, like for example a bunch of TTC and TTF font files, Skype, OneDrive and WMP file references, Metro Apps, drivers, shortcuts, etc. After I'd customized the WIM image, I installed the O.S. on a virtual machine (VMWare Workstation), and I was working for weeks on that V.M. by installing custom apps, 3rd party themes, and reducing a little bit more the space on disk because my intention was to capture the modified partition with DISM with all the customizations applied to generate a new Install.wim so in that way I can burn a Windows 10 ISO with all my programs installed by default and the system personalizations I did. 

(it will be saved as a registry script in the current user's desktop) Run these commands to take ownership and also full acces of your current user on the registry key trees: 

Time ago I've used one of those strange tricks that let you customize Windows in some way, to remove the librearies and also the shell folders from the navigation pane (save/open file dialogs) in Windows 7, it worked fine but I don't remember where I've seen this trick and anyways I'm not using Windows 7 anymore. How I can remove the shell folders from the navigation pane in Windows 8.1 x64?: 

Instead of looking for a permissions rollback, I will try to give a different point of view to solve that specific problem that I quoted. You could try to give the necessary user permissions to the entire service's registry key tree with SetACL application, which you could download here (it's freeware): $URL$ 

I'd developed this module which facilitates the way to add or remove an external application to Windows startup trhough registry methodology. It covers the startup scope (Run/RunOnce), the user scope (Current User/All Users), the registry scope (x86/x64) and also is capable to add a bypass for "Secure mode" windows logon. An example usage: 

Anyways, note that some specific temporal files could still be in use by your application or other applications then you will not have access to delete in-use files, so maybe you will preffer to iterate the directory files then call the proper method to delete each found item, with a try/catch block. 

However, for strange it can seems, after deleted those registry keys and reseted the PC, seems that a restoration of those registry keys does not fix the problem, so... if deleted those keys, could be hard to recovery the contextmenu because a registry restoration will not work. (so now I know the cause of the problem, but I can't fix it, then I started customizing a new Windows 10 ISO without deleting those keys and all works good ) 

I'm running Windows 8.1 x64. Days ago I've noticed that all the items that I have in the menu has dissapeared. They dissapeared only from the menu, I'm an user who customized the sendto items from many years ago, I'm familiar with the usage of this, I have my shortcuts on the corresponding directory in but any item is shown in the SendTo submenu when I right-click on any file. If I press + I can see items in the sendto menu, but these items are the folders that I have in My Documents folder, what the...! I think that maybe some reg-value associated with the sendto menu is pointing the wrong directory?, someone could have idea of what happened with my sendto menu?. 

The problem is that I can't do it because I've installed the Home edition which comes without gpedit. However, when a group policy setting is applied a new registry value is created/modified, then just that value serves to automate the group policy setting via registry, so my question is more a request, I just need to know the name and path of the registry value that is created when applying that policy setting, in form of a Regedit script. Thanks in advance. 

First step is to open Run command box by simultaneously pressing Windows logo and R keys (Windows+R). In the Run dialog box, type Netplwiz and then press Enter key. 

As the find pattern is it will affect only to files that contains an extension (or folders that contains a dot). Use pattern instead, that will match possible files that does not have a file extension. The path syntax is wrong, you missed to add a backslash.
