For game designers, "MDA Framework" (Hunicke, LeBlanc, Zubek) is one of the most useful papers I've seen come out of academia. For books, "Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses" (Schell) and "Game Design Workshop" (Fullerton) are good picks, both written by professors. (In fact, most game design books worth reading were written by professors, as they tend to have more time for book writing than your average working game developer. Most game design books that aren't worth reading were also written by professors, though.) This question seems like it carries some kind of mistrust of academia (the whole "those who can, do; those who can't, teach" thing), but that ignores that especially these days, there's an awful lot of crossover between academia and industry. I worked in games for ten years before crossing over into teaching, and I still do industry contract work when I can; does that make me part of the game developer community, or the academic community? I could name a dozen others off the top of my head in the exact same situation. So I'm not sure that the distinction of "academic or industry" is even meaningful anymore. 

Other answers seem to be looking at this from a legal standpoint, but it sounds like you are talking more conceptually. First, note that Parody and Homage are two very different categories; in the former case you're ridiculing the game's weaknesses, in the latter celebrating its strengths. I would say in either case, the question of when you cross the line to "just another ripoff clone" is answered by whether your game adds anything new to the discussion. For a parody, your game should not just be copying another game's mechanics, but it should be engineered to point out the flaws in the original in a way that the original game does not. For example, a parody of an old-school CRPG might not only have the player do a meaningless treadmill-grind for XP, but constantly remind them of how meaningless this is and how the game is just artificially increasing their required play time. Or it might eliminate the grind entirely, shortening the entire epic 40-hour experience to five minutes. In either case, the original game's mechanics are selectively copied (or not) to showcase a weakness with the form. To tell whether you are successful, I suppose a worthwhile question would be, "after playing this parody do you feel different about playing the original game?" For an homage, you should be taking the original game further, improving it in some meaningful way. Here the question would be, "what reason is there to play this homage game, rather than playing the original?" and you should have a good answer! 

There's a book called Patterns in Game Design that is more or less exactly what you're looking for: $URL$ I'll warn you of a few things. First, a lot of the mechanics in that book didn't have names, so the authors invented them, so sometimes the terminology can get confusing. Second, the list is large, and while there are links between related concepts, it's still a lot to take in. Third, about half of the mechanics are on an included CD-ROM rather than in the book itself, with lots of cross-referencing between the two, so looking up a chain of terms can sometimes take you back and forth from one to the other. Admittedly, these are all issues you'd probably run into on your own once your list got to be a certain size, anyway. 

Easy answer: when you are offered the interview in the first place, ask how they prefer applicants to dress! If you forget, you can always call/email your contact at that company and ask in advance. It's a reasonable question and you don't lose points for asking. The good news is that the game industry is mostly a meritocracy. I personally like to wear a suit and tie for the interview (it was just drilled into me when I was young to always always always do this), I usually get some gentle ribbing about how I'd better not show up to work looking like that, and then we get down to actually figuring out whether I'm a good fit for the position. I have plenty of colleagues who "dress down" and get hired that way, too. Ultimately, a hire / don't hire decision is going to come down to your skills, abilities, and fit. I have never, NEVER heard of anyone in the game industry getting (or not getting) a job solely because they did or didn't wear a suit. (I suppose if you showed up wearing a t-shirt with an offensive image on it that would count against you, or if you showed up wearing nothing but a Speedo or something, but accounting for basic common sense you should stress about showing why you're an awesome developer, not a snazzy dresser :) 

A word of warning: it sounds from your description like Seth is talking specifically about Facebook and other "social media" games. If those are the kinds of games you're designing then great, but be aware that the entire space of game design is much larger. (As others have said, the world has more than 7 dynamics.) If you want to know the other 3 that Seth was referring to, I'd suggest playing a bunch of Facebook games and looking for patterns. I'd be shocked if "set collection" isn't one of them. Another thing to be aware of: there is a difference between Mechanics and Dynamics, and what you're listing are actually Mechanics. It's good to be clear about exactly what you're looking for. The MDA paper (referenced in coderanger's answer) is talking about kinds of fun (what the authors refer to as "aesthetics" rather than mechanics and dynamics), although that paper does a good job explaining the difference. Note also there are other kinds of fun beyond these, as the authors admit. 

There are a lot of solutions to this, and it's up to you as the designer to choose one (or more) that are right for your game. Making PvP strictly "opt-in" solves the problem directly. Giving temporary "newbie protection" is a lesser version. You can put restrictions on who can fight in PvP -- for example, only allowing players to affect those within 2 levels. (Reducing rewards for bashing people lower than you and increasing rewards for attacking those who are more powerful can curtail "newbie-bashing" in Achiever-type players who are trying to rise through the ranks, but not so much with Killer-type players who have more fun by ruining someone else's day.) Only activating PvP when players reach the level cap (and/or just shortening the time it takes to reach the cap) reduces the problem as well. Some games (think CCG/TCG type games, FPSs, or really any kind of purely skill-based online game) don't even have level progression as a core mechanic, and a new player can have just as much a chance of winning as an experienced player, other things being equal. The danger here is that experienced players tend to be better at the game so they will win on skill grounds; this can be lessened through ranking/rating systems (which again segregate players by skill level, if designed well), creating several servers for different play styles (casual, pro, family/kid friendly, etc.), or community management (giving experienced players and community leaders incentive to teach new players, for example). For games where players continue progressing indefinitely (a lot of Facebook games are like this), the solution I've seen is a reset of some kind. This can either be on an individual basis (when a player reaches the level cap, they're given the opportunity and incentive to restart with a new character) or a server-wide basis (monthly server resets, or a reset when some player or group of players manages to reach some kind of "win" condition, which gets them into a permanent "winners" list and causes a reset). This doesn't fix the problem immediately, but it does mean that anyone new to the game knows there will be a level playing field soon enough, and they are free to explore the game mechanics in the current cycle without worrying about screwing up too much.
