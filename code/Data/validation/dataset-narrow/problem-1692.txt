Short answer from the comment section Run before running Longer Answer The utility includes a dependency on the search utility 

Pulse Audio was designed specifically for this use case. Here is the Pulse Audio API Documentation. Here is a Pulse Audio Python Library. 

Rather than device 0, which should be the Raspberry Pi audio. I also needed to unmute the microphone in Make sure you select the USB device via the F6 menu... then F5 for all channels. 

has a option which will prevent the configured device or partition from being mounted automatically upon boot. 

Adafruit provides the full schematic of each sensor board. The capacitors on the board should be marked as C1, C2, and so forth. Capacitors in parallel add: 

Use of If you do use , it's probably best to use the ntp pool servers, and set a cron job to run every hour or so to check the pool for the correct time. 

Just like any other CCD device, the camera module is subject to radiation stress. A good rule of thumb is to filter out radiation which is not intended to be captured, and to limit all exposure to intense radiation of any kind. Further Reading: Radiation Hardness of CCD Sensors 

Looking at the schematic of the AD/DA board you referenced, the and pins are directly connected to the AD and DA pins. If I were designing the board, I would have over-engineered it and placed a 2 to 4 decoder and a bus controller... which would be too many chips... and my boss would ask me to cut back the components. The AD only "sends" data and the DA only "receives" data. So, the pins allow independent selection of whether the SPI bus is, to borrow GPIB terminology, a "listener" or a "talker" or both. 

This last step is probably the one you are missing. Debugging Raspberry Pi OTG Serial Gadget g_serial On the Raspberry Pi Connect monitor and keyboard and apply power to the Raspberry Pi. Once booted login and drop into a root shell: 

I think I tracked it down for you... You removed the for user ... but, if you are using , there is another here:

If you have a GNU/Linux host machine, you can simulate enabling the Serial Getty Service on what will be the Raspberry Pi's serial console. 

The Pi could be connected to both networks simultaneously, which would allow you to ssh into the Pi from either the wireless or the wired networks. Each network interface would have it's own IP address on the respective subnet. Since the Pi will be on the school's network, there may be multiple Pi units connected by other students. So, I would recommend either turning off or changing your RPi hostname to something other than . 

Strangely, when paging through the manpage, the command is listed as deprecated and results in a call to . I haven't looked too closely at the differences of where the package cache is stored or if there is some sort of identifier placed in the cache file to indicate that versus has been used to update the cache. So, I'm uncertain as to why is needed versus . I suppose it would be complicated to include updating the appropriate cache during the setup of , because dpkg is already running with a lock file. 

Short Answer... will probably morph into longer answer when I get to test it... To mount a USB storage device in a predictable manner, you can use ArchLinux has a terrific write-up on udev rule creation. And Writing udev rules: Daniel Drake should be helpful when attempting to predictable mount USB storage devices. 

The above diagram is a simplification of the timing diagrams found on pages 14 and 15 of the datasheet. All the information you need to use the ADC is included on the datasheet. 

Increasing transmission power is not likely to work well, since the IR LED has a particular breakdown voltage and current. So, we are left with concentrating transmission power and/or diffusing the beam. On mass produced remotes, usually there's a reflector backing the IR LED which helps concentrate the signal. This reflector can be a simple recess in the casing or a separate mounting attachment. Some also have diffusing lens which decrease directional signal control but increase the angle range. 

You will then be able to run the compiled Pascal program by typing its full path... something like this: 

Since it seems that you are using Ubuntu on your host PC, you can inspect the file on the SD card to find out what your username is on the Pi. 

Usually, but not always, is paired with . In this way, an unprivileged user may mount the file system. So, an line something like this: 

The datasheet for the MPU9150 indicates that the magnetic compass is the AKM AK8975. Looking through the datasheet for the AK8975 it seems that the output is MSB first. However, it seems from your code that LSB is read first. 

on the Raspberry Pi. The service enables the .local domain to be resolved on the LAN. It is common to have .local has the domain for LAN hosts. This simplifies accessing LAN hosts, just like it does for Internet hosts, by providing an name to IP address translation. However, since you have configured your network differently, disabling the will allow you to set your Raspberry Pi to a different FQDN. If you have accessed your RPi via previously, this will no longer function once is disabled. You will need to use the IP address instead or the new FQDN if the address has an in your DNS zone. 

Setup for OTG Serial Gadget Enabling the USB OTG Serial Gadget Plug your miniSD card into your card reader and navigate to the card's partition. This is the smaller of the two partitions. Edit the cmdline.txt file and add this directly after 

Connect to the device using your favorite terminal program. I prefer ... However, your device has particular permissions and group assignment. If you wish to use it as a non-privileged user, you will need to make sure that your user is included in the group. In my example, the group is ... and my user can be added to that group using this command: 

MacOSx and Debian Trusted X11 For some configurations, there is a problem with Trusted connections. The SSH man page suggests that some programs may crash when connecting to Debian systems. Raspbian is a Debian variant. So, it's possible that you will need to follow the Debian specific advice in the ssh man page: 

Most of what you find that seems to a "secret sauce" function are probably protected from full documentation or modification by the Broadcom License If you use a hex editor to page through the file, you'll see many low level function names. If you know how to hand disassemble into Op Codes, you'll find out what all these things do. However, it's possible... maybe even likely... that you'll get sued by Broadcom if you post the disassembled code with modifications to do something. Alas, proprietary firmware is still a problem even in today's world of supposed "Open Standards". The "system-on-chip" and "designed-for-something-else" isn't the secret sauce. Looking through some of the functions, you'll notice that many functions contain identifiers like rpi.function1 ... So, these subroutines were created specifically for the RPi. Maybe some were test routines, or something that was decided shouldn't be listed in the documentation... or some forgotten code for an early version... or... whatever. The main idea is that while what rides on top of the firmware may be Open Source, the firmware is not free software. 

You can do a trial and error experiment with a few values and see which one is best suited to your likes. Then you can create an for It's important to note that the units are millibels not decibels. So, a value of is not going to do much. Since the scale is logarithmic, 3.0dB is twice or one half power. So, the set point is one half power of the default setting. How to set an alias 

It might help in loading time. However, it might not. If it does improve loading time, then you could make a script or service file that creates the with each boot. However, it's possible that will load faster. So, you may want to transcode the as with ffmpeg on a different machine... since ffmpeg can be difficult to install on a Raspberry Pi.
