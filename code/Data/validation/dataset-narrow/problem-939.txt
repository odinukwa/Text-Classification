From time to time I use gVim in windows. I am used to running commands with which in Linux outputs into gVim window but in Windows the new command line window is opened. How to force gVim to output it in its window? 

Evidently it is because foreign address of the 127.0.0.1 is and option shows only ports with I suppose the is ip6 format. But why option shows only ip4 ports? 

I am attempting to setup a WiFi network with on ArchLinux where I have and (not anymore in ArchLinux). As I am reading some tutorials they offen refer to when setting up static ip for the wifi network interface. Is this file relevant also on systems with or should I use CLI to setup the static ip address ? 

I am wondering if the hard-disk can be somehow repaired in this condition or if it can be just scrapped. 

So basically IP treating the input from the transport layer as simply bytes (like transport layer treats application layer data) 2. Or the possible case, when IP and TCP boundaries match but more TCP segments are within one IP datagram whichtarget the same host but the contained TCP segments are part of different TCP connections. 

It's not a "pure" Bash solution, but then, Mac metadata isn't pure Unix either. I am calling AppleScript inline: 

The problem is that after the script runs, the "Open with" association is gone; the file opens with Console.app again. Is there any way around this in the script, like setting back the appropriate metadata after the line? 

I am using Outlook 2007 on Windows XP for work, and always hit to send messages. That's the shortcut in Mail.app and in MobileMe's Mail web app, and I prefer it to , which is Outlook's send mail shortcut. Spoiled by Mac OS X's ability to easily change shortcuts for any application, I've been looking for a way to change the shortcut. How can you do this? Update I ended up using TeX HeX's suggestion, AutoHotkey. The script I wrote is below: 

If you have a computer setup with iTunes reading from that NAS, then as long as that iTunes is running, you would be able to stream from that library with the Apple TV. You would need to have those movies in its library, but that shouldn't bee too big an inconvenience. 

I am trying to understand when is source and in manual both in terminal and online is mentioned that 

I have 6 nameserver entries in resolv.conf. Due to the recent changes in our network I added last 2 recently and did not bother commenting the old ones as I thought that having extra nameservers won't effect if the name is resolved or not and it will probably just take little bit more time. But without commenting out the previous 4 nameservers the names wont't resolve and I am just wondering why. Even in resolv.conf manual I see: 

I have a situation when I want to connect from Windows machine to a web server running in virtual machine in Linux host. For this I would like Linux host to listen on a certain port and redirect it to the guest OS. What is the best way to achieve this? 

Here I would expect mainly non-native code binaries, scripts, resource and textual help files for apps (which is in part so) but I see bash scripts in and suddenly I have a feeling that not all system-noncritical architecture-independent scripts are confined to this directory. 

It's #2 that seems to be giving me problems. No matter what I do, no files ever pass through its filter. When I expand the results for Get Folder Contents and any other Finder actions, I always see files in the results. But even when I specify the most permissive filters, this action never produces anything. If you want to debug this, just insert a new action up top: Get Specified Finder Items, dropping on any directory that has any files within it - although technically the "Filter Finder Items" should also be able to return folders. Update I'm now on Lion, and seeing the exact same behavior. I also tried replacing step 2's criteria with "Name ends with 'part'" but that didn't make a difference either. I ultimately ended up writing an AppleScript that accomplished the same task (see below). 

After some poking around and searching more, I found the answer, and it lies in ordinarily invisible data and metadata. The upshot is that iTunes LP primarily references files based on their XID. In order to assign the correct XIDs to the new files in iTunes, do the following (on a Mac): 

In learning materials is often a picture of one TCP segment which is inside one IP datagram which is in one link-layer frame. Is this always the case? Is there guarantee that TCP segment is atomic and is contained within one IP datagram? Does the same apply for datagram and frame? What I mean is this: 1. 

When provisioning a new instance of Linux VPS is there a way to install from yum or apt fixed version of packages other then just using VM image ? I know there are som package like java which have different version in the name but for most package there does not seem to be possibility to pick specific version and only the latest is installed. This leads to having different Linux packages between the instances of the same server as long as they are provisioned in different times. I use Ansible to provision new machines and to deploy infrastructure configuration. I would like to have something like known form which ensures that the version of dependencies (packages) ar exactly the same for everyone who install it. Then when upgrade is required it is done explicitly with bumping versions in 

I have a file whose extension is .log, though I have this particular file set to open in TextWrangler instead of Console.app (using "Open with" in Finder's Get Info panel). I have a Bash shell script () that uses SED to replace some text in a file, inline, like so: 

I just turned on Google syncing in my Snow Leopard (Mac OS X) Address Book, but I'm not seeing my Address Book groups in Gmail or Google Voice. Is this supposed to be the case? Is there a way to get it to work? 

Right-click (control-click) the .itlp file in Finder, and Show Package Contents Open the file in a text editor (TextEdit is fine) Open a Terminal window and enter the command Quit and relaunch iTunes Find the tag in the XML file for the first song, and copy its attribute (the part between the quotation marks) Right-click (control-click) the first song in iTunes, and Get Info Because of step 3, the Grouping field will have changed to . Paste the XID copied in step 5 into this field Repeat steps 5 and 7 for each track (if they're listed sequentially in iTunes, you can use the "Next" button in the Get Info window to accomplish this more quickly Once you've assigned the XIDs for all tracks, run the iTunes LP file and everything should work Quit iTunes Open the Terminal window from before and enter the command Quit Terminal Reopen iTunes, and you're all set and back to normal 

I know that BIOS/UEFI is used during computer startup to boot the system and check HW and that it provides abstraction over hardware Does this mean, that the OS kernel calls BIOS/UEFI layer when the OS is setup instead of interacting with hardware directly? 

I noticed that Opera browser is in version 12.16 for Linux version 22 for Windows. Why is there such a dramatic difference in version numbers? 

Are these bash scripts only simple wrappers for executables or what is the reason for them being there if they are architecture-independent? Is my reasoning correct or do I miss something? 

I expected that this would be everything necessary to get the Internet working but DNS did not work without adding to . What is the purpose of the DNS setting in *.network file then? 

Am I right in the assumption that it is not part of that 'shared' hdd but it is just a mounting point for a hdd/partition dedicated to one machine? (so basically not stored with other files at all) 

I was wondering if copying files between different file systems (for example from ext4 to ntfs) is slower than copying to the same file system (from ext4 to ext 4). I also would like to know how does this apply for cases of ext4, btfrs and ntfs. 

Get Folder Contents (Repeating for each subfolder) Filter Finder Items (File extension is "part") Move Finder Items to Trash 

You can also use the application X-Mouse Button Control to accomplish this. You only need to set the "Wheel Up" button to the "Scroll Window Down" command, and vice-versa. I am using this on Windows XP, but the app should work on 7 or Vista, also. It was very quick to set up, and since it's a GUI application, it was easier to use. 

I wrote an AppleScript to accomplish the same task, but I won't accept this answer, since I still think something's wrong with Automator (or I'm not understanding something fundamental about it). This is the AppleScript for a droplet that accepts one or more folders and removes all files ending with and has been working flawlessly for months, now (on Snow Leopard and Lion). 

I have a brand new Western Digital MyPassport Studio, which I'd like to use as a utility drive. It will boot my Mac Pro over USB, but not over FireWire 800. Western Digital's support basically told me it's not their problem, although their knowledge base article states that the drive should boot an Intel Mac over FireWire. It's partitioned like so (using GUID): 

However I can't find what this option is. My guess from context would be that it sets non-interactive mode for the shell but it is just a guess. 

I am using desktop and would like to have certain commands available in which just executes commands. I am appending to in but this works only for interactive shells. I have tried it with / but to no avail as well. 

I can add virtual WiFi interface with but this is not persisted and gets lost when the system is restarted. What is the proper way to make this permanent ? 

The word packet as in packet-switched network is often mentioned in context of various layers, from transport to link and I am slightly confused and I do not know what layer it refers to (if there is any particular layer). From what I know it seems to many that packet = IP datagram but I do not understand why is the word IP datagram used instead (and also used for transport layer UDP PDU) and why is the word packet used when discussing TCP or link layer. Is that correct? Is it probably synonym for PDU?
