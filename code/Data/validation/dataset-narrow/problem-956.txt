I have a device that is ready to install a Windows 10 Feature Update (1607 from 1511). The update was downloaded via Windows Update and is currently sitting resident in the system somewhere, waiting for the user to explicitly send it the command "Update and restart" via this menu: 

I have answered this as part of my attempt to fix another garbage setting in Windows 10 (the way it will wake your device up, and you in the process, to install updates you haven't approved.) Please consult Step 2 of my guide here. It explains how to modify the "Reboot" task in the "UpdateOrchestrator" section of the Windows Scheduled Tasks list to disable it and stop Windows from interfering with it. With this task disabled, your machine will never reboot unless you instruct it to. Cheers - Seagull 

Under Windows 8.1, I could have a monitor plugged into both outputs without any issue at all. It gave me a total of three fully-functional screens. With Windows 10, I am only permitted to have two monitors. The HDMI port is controlled by the NVIDIA graphics processor while the Intel processor controls the laptop screen and the MiniDP port. With two monitors of either configuration plugged in, the respective graphics processors work fine; however, if I plug a third in, the NVIDIA processor (HDMI) stops working. By "stops working" I mean it literally ceases to function. If I open the NVIDIA control panel while outputting through it, it shows me all the functions of a typical NVIDIA video card; with the MiniDP port and HDMI plugged in, however, the HDMI screen goes black and the NVIDIA control panel turns blank. If I have both plugged in and then remove the MiniDP wire, the HDMI screen suddenly bursts into life again. It's as if the NVIDIA processor ceases to exist the moment the Intel processor is controlling more than one screen. Windows 10's display configuration shows me 1/2 or 1/3 depending on what configuration I have plugged in, but never 1/2/3. It states "didn't detect another display" if I click 'detect'. This appears to be some sort of rogue power option or something. Initially I blamed NVIDIA, but they're at least providing regular graphics updates - Intel can only be bothered to state that there's a "beta version of the HD Graphics 3000 driver on Windows Update" and gives out two links, one broken, to the website, which is pointless since it's all done through the control panel on post-XP systems. Does anyone have any idea if there's anything I can do to fix this? I've become quite used to three screens; I see no reason to all of a sudden make do just because I've "upgraded" my OS. Please don't just tell me to upgrade my machine. I'm looking for proper advice, not a different perspective. Device manager (even though only one processor works at once): 

Using SplashTop (www.splashtop.com) as a VNC server, you can 'view' your laptop screen from your phone and use the screen as a mouse. It's a high network-overhead solution, but it does offer what you're looking for.

I have an answer that works for my ASUS ROG G551JW. I found it here - look for crdev1's August 2nd post (I will paraphrase the post here because there are a few extra steps I feel are necessary). His solution rests on ASUS' Realtek drivers being fundamentally unfit for purpose, forcing users to have to block Windows' driver recommendations and install another OEM's drivers (Dell's) in their stead. Once again this goes to show that Microsoft's attempts to force updates through for all users regardless of user preference are only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. I can confirm that as of ASUS' R6.01.7571 driver update, these steps are still very much necessary. Get it together, ASUS! 

Download the ES603 driver here. Excuse my rather arrogant language in the readme, even if I am correct. Extract the contents of the "INF files.zip" file. Right-click the .inf file and select 'install'. This allows Windows to recognise the USB device far enough to permit further driver installations for it. Run "2 - Driver Setup.exe". It's a standard EgisTec driver installer, but will fail without the first step having been satisfied. This explains to Windows fully what the device is. Run the Setup in the third zip to link the Driver to Windows' Biometric Framework (WBF). You need this to be able to sign in properly. Reboot your machine. Sign in as normal and go to your user settings section. In Windows 8 this is through the 'settings' option in the Charms; in Windows 10 it's in the "All Settings" section of the Action Centre. Set up a PIN for your account. I haven't checked in Windows 8, but in Windows 10 you need this to activate "Windows Hello", which permits use of fingerprints to sign in. Enrol your finger prints! 

The answer lies in the Group Policy editor, as does much of the in-depth configuration within Windows 10. Right-click the start menu button and select "Run"; from there type in "GPEdit.msc". Go to "Computer Configuration" and "User Configuration" (do it for both) > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Internet Explorer and find the option labelled "Prevent "Fix settings" Functionality". Set it to Enabled. From there, reboot to receive one last security warning. It will be a screamer /!\ as opposed to a critical stop (X). Right-click it and select "Turn off notifications for this app". Next, open the Control Panel by right-clicking the Start Menu and navigate to "Security and Maintenance". Where it says "Internet Security settings", click "turn off messages about internet security settings". After that you should be all done. 

As a LiveDrive user, upgrading to Windows 10 build 1511 from Windows 10 (or possibly a lower version) will result in your LiveDrive briefcase (L:) appearing as "Disconnected network drive" despite functioning normally. This is a registry issue and I will detail the fix below. 

I have done some research and I do not believe this can be fixed. I'm not going to pretend to understand the intricacies of WDDM but it seems to be something to do with version numbers and backwards compatibility. nVidia's GTX555M chipset has drivers that make it compatible with WDDM 2.0, which d√©buted with Windows 10; Intel have outright stated that the HD Graphics 3000 processor will never support WDDM 2.0. This appears to result in Windows switching between the two WDDM modes; if a monitor is plugged into the Intel port, Windows switches to WDDM 1.2 compatibility mode, dropping support for nVidia's WDDM 2.0 support in the process. Again, I'm not 100% about any of this but from a layman's point of view this appears to be the case. There are people going on in various threads about Intel HD Graphics drivers working for them, and they may, but it appears like laptops using the Intel HD Graphics 3000 chipset are not compatible with graphics processors capable of better performance on Windows 10. Intel disappoint their customers once again 

I find the SD Association's official SD Card Formatter tool (freeware) is very good for fixing removable drives that report the wrong capacity, type, etc. Give that a shot. 

Navigate to the following website: www.currys.co.uk - and look at any product. Here's a TV for example: $URL$ Now select the title of the product ("PANASONIC VIERA TX-49DX650B Smart 4k Ultra HD 49" LED TV") and you'll see a little box popping up, telling you that they have a price comparison service, clearly in an attempt to stop you from googling the product and finding it cheaper elsewhere. This is a very clever piece of code, and I don't really begrudge how this retailer is using it, but it upsets me that a website knows when I am copying information from it. How are they doing this, and how can I stop it? I know it isn't a Flash applet because I have click-to-run enabled. 

Windows 10 has a new notification system that it uses instead of system tray messages so that users can check back on old notifications they have not yet dismissed. One of the more odious messages that appears is one to "Restore Internet security settings" that shows up if you have disabled prompting to run files downloaded off the internet. The prompt in question is this: 

Please read carefully; this is not the usual uptime question. I tend not to shut down my computer per se but instead put it to sleep. It makes boot times quicker and allows me to use WOL. The various 'uptime' methods (sysinfo, uptime.exe, Task Manager, etc) will show the time since the last full boot, which means time spent sleeping is factored in. I am looking for true uptime; that is, only the time since the last boot my PC has spent awake. 

This question bears some similarity to .sitx File --- 7zip can't open it, what can? - however, that was answered six years ago and I don't know if the response is still accurate in 2016. SITX is a proprietary archive format created by Smith Micro software. In the early 2010s they released StuffIt Deluxe for Windows and in 2011 they released an updated version of their free StuffIt Expander tool - neither work in Windows 10, however, and they were poorly-written when they were new. Three years ago I asked Smith Micro if they planned on releasing a build of StuffIt Deluxe for modern PCs and they said it was imminent; I have heard nothing since then. Since the SITX file format is now basically abandonware, I wonder if there are any other programs that claim compatibility with the format - I was unable to find anything. Partial note goes to The Unarchiver, which claims partial .SITX support; it was unable to open my files, however. I have roughly 10GB of files in various .SITX archives so extracting everything in a virtual machine will take a very long time. Is there not any better, native option? 

Notice that this is not a typical Windows 10 power menu; the options for "Restart" and "Shut Down" appear alongside the options for "Update and restart" and "Update and shut down". Normally (for quality updates) the "Restart" option is turned into the "Update and restart" option. My specific scenario regards mass automation for use with an RMM tool. I need a way to push through a script via the command-line ‚Äì language not strictly important ‚Äì in such a way that the reboot requires no user interaction. I need to force a reboot command to the device via the command-line that explicitly forces the system to enter "Update and restart" mode and not just "Restart" mode. I know of a tool called ShutdownWithUpdates but it does not work for this (I tried); there is no functionality within the baked-in "Shutdown" tool either. Get-WUInstall does not appear to offer this functionality; certainly, it doesn't work when the update is already resident and downloaded on the system, which is the use case I am working towards. Screen macros are not an option. 

Also, it's worth mentioning that the 'diagnose' feature for Windows is actually quite good, unlike most of their Help facilities; try connecting an ethernet wire and right-clicking the network icon, selecting 'Troubleshoot Problems' (not sure of Chinese equivalent but it's the top of the two options on Windows 8.) 

I no longer believe this answer to be correct! (August 2016) I believe Enterprise editions do not get the 1511 update because of their type - Enterprise is the version you roll out to Employees of a company; you don't want them upgrading their Windows version (and potentially losing compatibility) without your explicit say-so as the administrator. If you download the 1511 ISO from MSDN and mount it or burn it to a USB stick, you'll be able to run it from the Desktop and install it without losing any files. This, I think, is the only way for Enterprise users to get the update. 

Facebook Messenger allows people to link in with sites like Tenor and Giphy to add GIFs to a conversation that play on a loop without user input. Facebook have shown no interest in allowing users to hide these images or forcing the images themselves to conform to the user's "autoplay videos" setting, so is there any way to block them via a uBlock Origin filter that will not affect anything else on Facebook? 

I can confirm this works. It's not an ideal solution because the ROG G551JW has a headset port and I use a headset, but the driver recognises it only as a pair of headphones, but at least we're getting a degree of driver functionality, which is more than we were receiving before. If this helped you, please consider telling ASUS to pull themselves together because this is frankly unacceptable. 

From here, I would take a close look at the command lines your system programs are running on. A common trait of Bitcoin Miner viruses is to hide in a suspect directory (eg C:\hgfjkhjfk) and name themselves something like svchost.exe to elude capture. If you enable command-line view, you'll immediately see if you're running a miner (not to mention other nasties) because you'll see all the parameters the command-line program has been passed. If you're seeing switches that would indicate your machine is being used to mine bitcoins, find the location of the file and weed it out. 

Which is acceptable to a degree if you're a knuckle-dragging troglodyte using a PC for the first time, but for most users it is completely unnecessary. Disable it in the "Internet Options" section of the Control Panel by going to the "Security" tab and clicking "Custom level...": 

I can't answer for anyone else, but I know Google users arrive here frequently, and I'm going to explain to them how I fixed this for my 600-page document filled with custom formatting, custom fonts and headers. I wasn't about to copy the contents into a second document and risk losing anything; the proofreading would take more time than I had going spare. Printing to PDF would have lost the hyperlinks scattered throughout the document. Images and constructions were integral to understanding what was being written about. In essence, "just do this" answers were not an option. I set the permissions for t2embed.dll as others here note, but I can't say how much good it did. Word 2016 was alternating between giving me an error ("The export failed due to an unexpected error") and turning white and crashing. It crashed every time I tried to export, it was just a question of when. The program was producing a .TMP file in the directory I was exporting to, but after a few seconds it would vanish and progress would halt. Eventually I decided to stick a camera up to my screen and film the output in the bottom-right. First it would enumerate the pages, then parse the links, and then slowly increment a counter for which page was being exported. This is assuming the program's interface hadn't crashed, so it took a few attempts. Eventually I found that the last number it was displaying before crashing was page 335. There was nothing strange about page 335, but replacing its contents with "removed to fix PDF export" caused the export to work fine. Eventually, I copied the contents of page 335 to Notepad++ and changed all the quotation marks and apostrophes (which Word replaces with spicier versions) into normal ones. I copied it back as plain text and removed the hyperlinks. It worked. For some reason, that particular page had become corrupted and wouldn't export. Re-producing it worked. 

I think you're looking for "set". Type "set >> file.txt" into a command window and regard the file it produces. 

The only reason I can ever think of that my machines have trouble accessing HTTPS sites is if the clock is wrong. You haven't listed the operating system you're using, but both Windows and OS X have a 'time sync' functionality; try syncing your clock up to or and seeing if this ameliorates your issue.
