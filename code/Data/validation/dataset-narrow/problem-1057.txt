Yes you can. I see multiple solutions. First: You can achieve this through LAN or even Internet. For this, you have to open your BIOS settings and turn Wake On Lan (sometimes it's called Resume On Lan) on. But that's not enough. You have to turn Wake On Ring or Resume on Ring as well (if you have), actually this may be called differently. So you would probably need to turn ALL Wake on Lan settings in BIOS. Then, you use special software (I use Linux and using script, search in Google for Windows programs). It's easy actually you can write your own. All you need now is to know your MAC address. Then turn your computer on. in my case I do this: (where 00:...33 is MAC address) Second: (but not for a remote start up!) Windows supports on schedule power on. but in this case you need to set your Machine into StandBy mode, rather than power off. 

This is Windows 7. In System properties -> Performance options -> Adjust for best performance It makes what I want only for the Desktop if I go into folder and try to select the files the selection rectangle is like in the first image. How to make it everywhere? 

As far as I know in order to use two subnets on one physical cable VLAN's are recommended. However, is it possible to achieve this (i.e: two subnets on one physical network) like and networks. What kind of problems or hidden rocks this way contains? With VLAN's it's possible to better isolate so users wouldn't easly sniff the other network. But in my environment it's okay if user on one subnet could listen to the traffic on another network. Is it the only problem? 

I would try to check the mouse on another computer. Try to reinstall chipset drivers (motherboard) or USB driver's in particular. I think the problem may come from a computer power supply unit too. 

I am looking for an efficient and preferrably free tool to take a full copy of my USB stick and make a disk image from it with possibility to write back to it. Actually I have a CF-Disk and I am mounting it through adapter so in Windows it's looks like a USB flash disk. I can't just copy and paste the contents of that disk since it's bootable. So I need to make a full backup. At a later time I wanna be able to restore it to either that CF-Disk or Another one but similiar disk. Looking for Windows 7 compatible program 

Is there any possibility to convert Windows 8 Enterprise to Pro edition so I could normally activate it? I used Enterprise 90 trial version which has been expired. Now I want to legally buy a license but this is an Enterprise edition, it's impossible to just buy it for a home PC. On the other hand I don't want to buy CD and re-install a Pro version on top of current setup. If I just get Pro CD and install it, would that overwrite all the installations I have? 

Some applications can't be launched more than once at a time. Is there any way to workaround this? And make those programs "think" that there is no other instances of this app working? Windows 7 32 Bit 

Can you please give me a hint on how to create CA to Digitally Sign MS Office documents (2007 or 2010) as well as Adobe Acrobat files. I know that MS Office supports this. All you have to do is to use existing CA. However, we'd like to create our own. If you can direct me (and others who asking this question) by giving book names, articles. That would do the job. Basically it's a very small organization where we'd like to start automating working with documents. And after proper tests, we'd buy, then, if needed, certificates from CA's. I found this article: $URL$ However I am not sure if this can work for Digital Signing of the MS Office and Adobe Acrobat documents? 

10.04 is quite old and it contains old kernel with old drivers. Consider upgrading to 11.10 or even 12.04 alpha. You may probably need to run ifconfig -a 

I am using Incognito Mode and today I have noticed that when I frequently visit some site in that mode browser logs it and even on not incognito mode it autofills in address bar making Incognito mode useless in my case. Another fun thing is that the item is not in History so I can't manually remove it. Couldn't find anything in Settings. Why is this happening? BTW, instant search is disabled in my case. Using the latest version to date. Extensions installed 

Found out! It was because the Windows Update service was turned off and RSAT is installed as Windows Update. 

Your version is not suppported now. Meerkat support has been dropped on 10 of April. Support droppage means there wont be any upgrades including security updates. If you are using it on server, you have to worry and certainly upgrade (I recommend Precise Pangolin since its an LTS release and its support period would last until 2017. As more services you running as more dangerous your situation is. Dont afraid of upgrading I am using Ubuntu many years and release to release upgrades never was problematic. For Home Theater...well..I am dont think you have sensitive information on it and it wouldnt be a desirable target for hackers, unless its connected to Internet, its playing major role for you and it has a real IP with many open ports. If you have Samba installed. Make sure you upgrade it to the latest as the is absolute serious security whole recently found. For the future Always use LTS versions for any type of servers. 

We are going to use Windows 7 and have couple of users to work remotely in Windows 7. Please can you tell me, what kind of limitations does it have? 

How to find out do I have NAND Flash or NOR flash (Compact Flash) I have Transcend UDMA 300x 2Gb. No mention is it NAND or NOR flash 

Is there any way to make Windows XP installation write protected? And all changes would go to the RAM directly? That would cause that after every reboot things would be fresh all the time while loosing all the changes. The reason is that. That Windows XP would be just an RDP client. So, no intensive work would be made there. This way I could be somehow more secure on any hardware resets, restarts, shutdown. I mean it wouldn't be corrupted. 

Most of the time technical articles about different RAID levels mostly about how redundant they are, how fast on read/write etc. But I can't find information about would a disk in a certain RAID live longer than on other RAID level. (ignoring the capacity, speed and redundancy factors) Especially I am interested in RAID 5 vs RAID 10. RAID 5 allows us redundancy when one disk fail RAID 10 allows us at least 1 disk fail redundancy. But if we have two 100% servers (except different raid levels) wit the same data, the same load etc. (again, despite the capacity factor) so, in which, RAID disks would "live" longer? for RAID 5, a RAID controller would calculate parity on any write/read, correct? this is penalty. for RAID 10 it would mirror and stripe It is all about Hardware RAID if it matters! 

I'm fighting with CANON LBP 810 (and 1120) printers for a month.. they work locally fine. However I must work with it through JetDirect. JetDirect, because I have Thin Clients and I am connecting the printers to the device. So when I'm trying to install it, (I got official drivers to Windows 7). It's not working 

If you are looking for a high load application I would go with nginx+ php-fpm. As this is better when it comes to memory usage. It would consume less memory eventually Giving you ability to handle more Requests Per Seconds. For static content I would suggest you to use CDN. At least Amazon S3. With managing content through CDN you can go with apache + modphp.its okay really. Dont forget to make optimizations on database level. 

Number of concurrent users that can work in Windows 7 remotely via RDP. Is there any other limitations? Does it depend on Windows 7 flavors? (Pro, Ultimate etc.) 

The problem is not with RDESKTOP nor with Windows. It's from the way how Linux (and other OS) works with Removable Media. They are supposed to be removed safely and then be unplugged in order to make sure freshly written data has been synced. What you can do is to inform your system to make those "syncs" more often. you can write a C daemon which would do it for you. Or you can dig into the kernel module settings and specify not to use write-cache. 

I have two (exactly the same model) monitors attached to the system. The problem is Windows 8.1 (up to date) is failing to find out which is right and which is left. I am having to move my mouse to the LEFT side of the LEFT monitor in order to reach the second monitor which is illogical. The fun thing is that, setting up certain monitor as primary is not helping. Also I tried to change the order of coords, with no help! The last thing is to change the physical order of monitors :D but may be there's a better solution for this weird situation? 

LDAP is: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is a hierarchial database suited to be used in the organizations to store the records. In Windows if your machine is joined to Active Directory domain you already using LDAP. LDAP is a standard and Active Directory supports it and using it (working through that protocol). Treat it like a database of data about the personal in your company. It's not for end users it's rather for administrators. So if you are asking what is it and how can you use it, then, probably, you don't really need it. 

Also you can try to create a small shell script and put that command there and just execute that single script from your cron 

After doing some research I found out that it is not possible with standard components. You need to install third party software/drivers which would help to accomplish this. One can use Microsoft SteadyState or use other programs. Microsoft SteadyState has been discontinued couple of years ago but still can be found somewhere in the Internet (for example here: $URL$ 

I couldn't find any freeware to accomplish this. So I decided to set up Jabber (XMPP) server. It is supported by most of the IM clients (Pidgin, Miranda IM etc.) 

couple of users are using one Windows Server 2003 Terminal Server via RDP. We need a LAN chat program. Can you suggest us? We used VyPress Chat before we moved to RDP. But it doesn't support multi user working simultaneously. We need only a chat for a LAN. The must have feature is ability to send files too. 

No, you can't. Because those redirected printers are connected with the remote desktop and the client only. There is no access from other machines. Those printers called Transient printers and they are temporarily created 

The answer is that HTTPS is for Secure interaction between client (the browser) and server (site) but it requires additional computer (client and server's) resources to work. Therefore, sites don't use HTTPS everywhere. ALso, since HTTPS uses, so called, Certificates which are not free to use (they could create their own Certificates though for free, but browsers would complain that it's issued by Untrusted source). Sites use HTTPS only in critical pages like Login pages, shops etc. In your case it is actually not the browser issue it is rather site configurations. However, possibly, FireFox detects two versions of sites (http and https) and prefers HTTPS over HTTP.
