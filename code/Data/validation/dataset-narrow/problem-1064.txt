For better readability of the formula I've converted your first range to a table, of course you can use addresses too. 

For 1 and 0 use custom number format with and description, percentage and currency are also set through number formats. 

This is a more error proof formula compared to your original one, as it will really summarize columns and variables which are mentioned in the header and first column, you can't change them by mistake. Worst case can happen if you mistype something that you get error or 0. , where: 

Besides the thunderbolt connection, you can also use the Type-B port to connect the monitor to the pc: 

Conditional formatting formula is always applied at cell level. If you go to another cell in the range with the conditional formatting, you'll probably see different references. 

you can use a calculated column which quickly do it for you: supposing that original data is in Column A 

Ordered input: Current assignee: - as your data is ordered this will find the current row, no need for a helper column. Set the name of the cell counting this to currRow just for easier referencing. Assignee: - x: -1, 0, 1 for previous, current and next rows respectively. Non-ordered input: Current row: - this is an array formula, so you need to enter it with CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. Current assignee: Same formula as before. Previous: - also an array formula. Next: - and still an array formula. 

Do you need a formula or just a one go task? If you don't need to do this often I think manual approach is the quickest here: copy your second column to the third column to the right position (shifting up one row) then sort by first column and you can quickly delete all rows now where first column is "job state". If you need to do this frequently than even a simple macro can do this for you. 

You need to add a new column where you put for sold and for the other rows. (can do easily with a formula: ) Then in table pivot table just calculate average of this column and format it as percentage. 

Actually it's a very good question I'd also use frequently, but unfortunately currently I don't think there would be a general solution you could use. One workaround would be to use VBA function, but it's also have it's own limitations, below you can find a short function to do it (of course if you want to use it broadly it need to be improved e.g. error handling, adapt to more operator, not only ): 

You can clean them by formatting. Just before connecting them make sure that your pc does not do any action when a usb drive is connected, so it can just format them without reading anything. 

It seems to be a global setting, I don't think you can change it in Excel. Go to control panel - region and language - first day of week: 

Note: it'll insert also as bold, if you specify it not to be bold, then original bold text will also be converted. If you really need it not bold, then need to do another find and replace, replacing bold to non-bold . 

Instead of pivot table and copy-paste, you can also set up a range where you get the desired layout with some complex formulas, but that also requires control when you change data, and for large datasets it'll take time to recalculate. 

If I understand well you can select your range, your question is just how to distribute the formula. Here are two easy ways I use frequently. - if your formula is already entered in the first row: Select your range containing also the formula and press 'CTRL+D'. - If you haven't yet entered your formula: Select your whole range and enter your formula just as you'd write it in the first cell, but when ready press 'CTRL+ENTER' instead of just ENTER 

I'd just add "if the contents of a cell in E are found in Column T AND Column V is empty, then return empty string in Column X" And we can simplify all above to if the contents of a cell in E are found in Column T, then return Column V in Column X So you don't need to use complex conditions: 

(Alternatively you could do it with ADDRESS and INDIRECT functions, but this would make your formula too much complicated). 

You can select the option , so both before and after spacing will be applied only before and after your code section. 

Can Microsoft Office recognize input language automatically? I'm thinking it in a way as it works e.g. in Google Translate: just give a piece of text for it and it gives back most probable language. 

you can add those words to your custom dictionary so Office applications will consider them to be correct in all documents. you can disable spell checking parts of a document: 

When you insert autofilter in an Excel sheet, Excel thinks you want to filter the current range only. In your example it's only the first row. To let Excel know your range you can either: 

Add (that works for me, if not works for you try char(10)) AND enable text wrapping in the cell, otherwise new line character won't have effect. 

As you anyway convert your logical values to number why do you want to change your data instead of adjusting your formula to accept text too: 

You can set to interpret your dates as text in the axis, so no need for helper column: Insert your chart (as in your second example), then right click horizontal axis - properties - then select "axis type" : "text axis" 

Besides video signal, also power should be delivered through that USB cable, so I'm afraid it won't be so easy. Official site of ASUS lists only a few devices and motherboards being compatible with the monitor: 

I'd do it using a helper row. You can add it above / below your range, keep it up to date using a formula and also hide it. The formula in the helper row: 

try activesheet.range("K:K") instead of just range. Do you have only one sheet in your files / are you sure the desired sheet is selected? Please check again whether intersection of used range and column K is really exist. 

To get the height of your data I used on column B, it will work correctly only if you don't have blank cells in column B. 

sort your data on first column (if it's not already sorted) create a new column with the formula delete or hide your original second column 

You need to place your code in of your sheet's code module (not just a general module), so it'll run after you change any value in your sheet. 

Select your data Go to Data tab - text to columns you've two options: a. either select "delimited", then press next and select space as delimiter b. either select "fixed width" then press next and move the delimiter line to the desired location press next select second column and set its data format to "text" press finish 

As I've commented, just ignores empty input, so you don't need to worry on excluding it from the input. If you have a situation when you want to exclude input data, then you can do it with array formula. In the below example I've just added a helper column to mark which data need to be included, however you can also write other criteria. The formula in B6: 

This will shift right your first range and shift down second reference. (place first formula in row 1). 

Note that this add-in doesn't have the functionality to replace only in selection, so you need to take care to write specific enough look for expression. 

Word doesn't accept in regular expressions, you need to use instead. So your replace with field will be: 

Setting column widths and row heights in Word is indeed not always easy. Looking to your video it seems second column in your table probably has a minimum width set. To fix it: 

No, unfortunately there is currently no way for creating an Excel table with header column instead of header row. Also I'm not aware of any other spreadsheet tool which would support that. 

Just selecting the data, then going to shows me a chart which seems to be a solution for your issue. 

Select the column with the values Go to: "find and select" - "special"; select "blanks" and press "ok" type then press the UP ARROW press CTRL + ENTER 

Note: it works correctly only if lines are separated by paragraph mark (ENTER) and there are less then 10 paragraph marks per cell. 

Email headers doesn't contain information about preceding mails, so you can't prove anything. In the future the best way is to change the process: B should always copy C when refers to his approval, or even better: C should send his approval directly to you (keeping B in copy) 

You can do it with a pivot chart, there you can (interactively) filter your data. Select your data, go to insert - pivot chart. Then set it up as in the picture below. (I've added a helper column: row number for easier plotting, you may not need that, depending on your real data). 

Once you have it in your ribbon you can reach it pressing ALT + it's sequence number on the ribbon. (ALT+4 in your example as that's the 4th option). Pressing and holding ALT also shows you the available shortcut options. 

According to my understanding Skype meetings are just the same object as any other meeting, just they have a link to a Skype (for business) meeting. What you need to do is just create a new Skype meeting and copy it's link to your existing meeting instance, then delete the new meeting object. 

That's the expected behaviour of Excel, to check for both and (empty string) you can use this formula: 

I've an Excel template stored as an embedded file in a Word document (to keep template and instructions together). My preferred process would be: 

Your zero is , which is TEXT, NOT A NUMBER. Therefore you shouldn't compare it to a number. Exclude s around in your first formula. 

put the image BEHIND the text and make the text disappear when you want to show your picture. instead of doing the animation in the slide make 2 similar slides: with and without the picture. This case it'll be a bit more long to edit your presentation, as after editing the slide without picture you'll need to duplicate text to the other one. Advantage of this view is that you'll slides with both visible text and picture for printout. 

This can add multiple line breaks, so if you append entries to your document after some content is already formatted, then selected the new entries before doing replacement. 

In Excel: Convert your data to a table: Insert tab - Table This way the formulas will be automatically inserted in new rows (you may need to edit formula entered before conversion to table, to let Excel know that it's the formula to be used in the column (just press F2 then ENTER)) 

This is an array formula, so after entering it press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER (you may need to use STDEV.S instead of STDEV.P depending on your data model) 

I generally use regex add-in to manipulate text with more flexibility than built in search / replace. It provides both find / replace and also worksheet functions with regular expressions. In your example you need to 

You can do it with find - replace: In the original document, before pasting it to the other one (save it to a temporary location if you want to prevent changes in the original copy): 

Otherwise please specify what your formula should do. Ultimate optimization: Again, if you understand your issue well: you don't even need the double sheets, just one. 

There is no way for that without macros. You can't avoid using and it can't manage array as "lookup value" parameter. I think the best option is to use a helper column as you've already described. 

That could be anything e.g. a temporary I/O error on your disc. If you succeeded to unzip second time then the zip is ok. 

Not straight way. Excel stores dates as numbers, but counting from 1/1/1900, so 201611 won't be November 2016, you need to use some formula: In a new column enter the formula: 

You can't change your original cells in Excel with standard formulas, what you can do is to extract the price into a new cell / column. To extract first : 

Next step is to group (bin) your data You need to group data in order to get enough amount of information in each group to show a realistic chart (e.g. group together companies with computerisation 0.015 - 0.025). As probability is going from 0 to 1, a very easy grouping is just to round them, entering a new column, you can round to 

Word doesn't have an object to mark line ends within paragraphs, so it's really a tricky task. As a workaround you can: 

returns day of month, not absolute number of days. As Excel stores dates as integer part is day, decimal part is time, you can use these formulas: 

(as I don't have sample data, I couldn't check the solution, it may have minor issues, but the concept is right). 

Unfortunately there is no easy way for that. Best workaround I came up until now is to copy unique columns to a new sheet (I hope you have them) and enter comments there. Then use to populate comments in the original sheet. 

You need to add a helper column, which checks location of next and calculates location of : Helper formula in the new column: 

This formula checks each interval whether it contains the actual day, and if yes, then includes its daily amount (added helper column) to the total. Formula used in "daily amount column": 

You can achieve it with a pivot chart: insert a pivot chart, then select group and sub-group columns for axis labels and scores for values. 

update I've realized has to be skipped also in , also added more criteria according to your description to avoid matching multiple row long entries: 

The only possible option from your list is to switch off pop-ups, however that's need to be done from options and can't be done during editing the formula. Other option could be 

One way is to define separate styles for code and text, then record macros activate. Finally assign shortcuts to the macros. 

The approach you are using () converts empty values to , which obviously gives the same error when it's a divisor too. Two approach to use which work in this case:
