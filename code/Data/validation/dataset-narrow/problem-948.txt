In my experience, one to get quite good fps is Camtasia. I use an old version given away by a computer magazine, in a DVD. The company used to give away older versions for magazines, now I don't know. I have been able to capture 60fps with no issues 1024x768, and 1280x800. So, not exactly 720p but very similar. Using an i5 650, 4ghz, with a way worse card than you have (now that I remember, have captured no issue 60fps with a pentium 4). Beware is not all about that hardware. Is probably way more important that disk is fast, and it is defragmented. If your windows is unstable, or have memory problems, that's going to be an issue, though. The key for hickups tends to be memory/disk. I have, even with Camtasia, noticed a better performance setting Windows fully to the resolution, or close, in which vid is to be captured. IE, setting desktop at 1024x768, so no window/region capture, but simply full screen capture, video output being then 1024x768. Anyway, there are settings you'd better tweak in preferences. If you can not purchase any old magazine issue + CD, for the Camtasia thing, I have been experimenting with a jewell for capturing ingame shots, but it seems to capture anything. And it's free, and showing amazing performance: Gregion . Was the only one allowing me great capture at high fps, of complex experiment I was making. Of course, if all this fails, you still have the option to download Camtasia trial, see if works for you, and then purchase it... EDIT: The reason why fraps might be capturing better, is because surely those capturers do leave it more for the 3d card, and usage of direct3d/opengl is being way more optimized in a game, than in a general usage system desktop. Sounds like the card is making most of the job. 

With all above you should be setup for making certain quantity and kind of projects. Still, gotta stress that with Blender you have the zbrush "clone", a 3d painter, great character animator, a very fast renderer (version 2.5x), game formats exporter, etc. It makes it all. So, as a do-it-all free solution. 

Previewing only, I don't know in OSX, but in Windows thumbnails mode in folder does a pretty good job at that. Other solution is using Photoshop Automate batch feature, or using an open source tool like imagemagik to generate (you could even make an automated task to be done for example at iddle times, etc) thumbnails from all the folder, and so would have that other folder as a "fast previewer". But if need zooming non of these will do. You need to load the thing fully.(unless it is always same area to zoom in, then you can as well do a batch that what outputs is the zoomed in, and reduced version) 

I would check privacy options inside "options", to se if something is disallowing that setting to stay(be careful no to relax it too much). Also, bit of dumb thing, but once you clicked Options and once back at login screen, I have no Messenger installed right now, but check it does not empty the two checkboxes : "Remember my ID and password" and "Sign me in automatically". Other than that I can only thing a matter of a permissions/user conflict... 

You can mount sli configurations with different manufacturers, but ensure they are same model, ie, GTX 580. Anyway, consider 2 cards usually use more power, produce more warming, and probably noise. (besides the mother board needs to be big enough and be compatible with that configuration. ) Sometimes diferent models can work together when it's really that the manufacturer is actually giving a new name to a slightly retouched old mid or high end ones, but internals are pretty similar (happens with some gts models and older mid/high end cards) 

You have your photo layer. Make a star with polygon tool, you can set the settings for it in top bar options. Previously, be sure the top bar options are set as "shape layer"(first of the 3 icons). That is, ie with color white selected, when you drag the polygon tool, a star with white color fill is created, not transparent vector only. This creates a new shape layer. You can reposition or modify however the star by, with black or white arrow vector tool (ie, hitting A key) clicking on the arrow in the canvas, or in the shape in the layers list (it shows a white quad, and at its right, a star shape) Click and drag in layers list, the star shape and drop over your photo layer. A star shape appears to the right of the photo layer thumbnail, in the photo layer, at layers list. Delete now the shape layer that got created above the photo layer. You should have now a layer showing only the photo pixels forming the star, the ones inside it. You can select with vector arrow the start, or click in teh shape of layers list, and hit ctrl + t to rotate the start, distort it, etc. Or use the white vector arrow tool to fine tune modifying the star vertices . The pixels shown wil update automatically, nothing to worry. 

Are you playing the thing in an internal player of the editor? In most proggies, when adding a filter like this, for a defective behaviour, in some cases, you need to actually render, or compile or how you prefer to call it, to a video format and codec, be it an avi, mpeg, etc, with whichever the codec, as usual. As that can be just some editor glitch, but internal data is working ok, and will compile as you wish the effect to be. Happens in many video editors, sadly. Edit, of course, what I mean is: render the avi, then check from the folder, externally, not from the software. Just double click and see what happens with the effect. 

As very good commercial specialized task tools (besides Wings3D, imo at the highest professional level, even while is free) : 

Could be several things. A hang in general with video editing happens a lot when dealing with uncompressed video codecs. Not sure if I read up there that original video is in yuv420p codec. It maybe gets hanged trying to handle a lot of memory or when compressing directly the images to mp4. One thing I can think of is converting first to avi, ie, outputting to an avi but forcing a lossless codec like camtasia / camstudio (I think ffmpeg supports it) , so it is not so "heavy", and then do a second operation to convert to mp4. Other matter is... -r15 ? You surely know better which fps is having the original video, but it uses to be 24fps or so, isn't it? Also... You might force as well the output codec, not just the format. MP4 works pretty well with .h264 codec, which gives a lot of quality and incredible small size. If I remember well ffmpeg also supports it. (you might want to try this first of all...) Edit: Remember -codecs gives you the list of codecs, in command line. You can of course, for example in Win console, ffmpeg -codecs > codecs.txt for easier reading, searching etc. Healthy to do also with -formats, etc. 

Might be a drivers or paths issue. Maybe try to fix it hitting f8 (usually just the instant the beep sounds, tap it several times) so you can access the boot menu and boot in safe mode. Then try to fix once windows loaded so.(ie, disabling some hardware device, etc, to isolate the problem) You used fixboot and fixmbr, so, should not be a problem...But remember XP installs its boot stuff always in C, despite in which partition you did install Windows XP folder. Anyway, I have heard nice things about Clonezilla, for these matters. 

I guess you are using Imagemagick.The problem is not related to any software, simply you will need to do a resize keeping each photo ratio, then a crop using the other ratio(you need to loose part of the image, then, and in other cases, add a chunk at the bottom of solid black, etc). I tend to do this with certain freeware, Irfanview. Using Batch option (just open one image in the folder with irfanview, and hit b key) , I'd set advanced options as checked, then use the options there to resize and crop, it offers quite flexibility. Nothing you couldn't do with Imagemagick, though, Surely you are letting it stretch, but you could possibly force the crop without changing the ratio... Other way is using Photoshop automate menu, combining with an Action(macro) previously done by you. 

Looks like you have activated, without knowing, a feature to extract AC3 audio from DVD playing. Check settings/preferences for mp4, dvd playback, extraction,codecs configuration (or global configuration of a codec pack if you install those things) in your player. Imho is very possible that is just that, it is actually being told to extract audio tracks. 

You surely have a selection loaded (hit ctrl + h to see if it is hidden) with a large feather or tolerance value. Just hit ctrl+d to deselect. Or you are using some layer mask, or applying some filter, or maybe you have some "layer efect" on the layer (create a new layer and ensure that you are not creating a layer effect in the proccess. Do it in that new layer.) . With more info on the procedure I could give more clues... 

your XML is an ascii text file, or should be. Check it in any text editor and make the typical ctrl + f search, for example, with words like "texture" , "material" or better, the name of your jpg or whatever the file. (ie, skin.jpg ) . Never tried that with Cinema, but have used many xml files in 3D and most usual problem is about non relative or relative path being the cause, or other detail like that. An edit in the text editor and re-import might fix it. 

When there is no LAN conectivity or internet, no, it does not need to be blinking. If light is steady and on, it should be fine. You might just have some misconfiguration in the router (IP, dns, dhcp, etc) Did you have a power shortage? two things might have happened if so: Simply the router lost some configuration setting (so, check it all well) , and sometimes I have noticed that powerline devices loose for some hours conectivit,y with one of these events, or when some machine of large power usage got triggered, or if it had a problem. Like as if stuff happening in the internal cables might affect the quality of the signal. Also check if you changed somehow the cables installation, or where are you plugin now the devices, if you plugged it in a different room, etc (always do directly in the wall, and remember distance can be a factor). If there was some change in that. Have you checked with a laptop using same powerline device? 

Yes, you can open again the file (ie: Outlook. pst ) It should take the new ones. Not import, but open in an special way: Go to File menu, Open, Outlook Data File. You should have just copied the pst file from the folder, not "exported" from your other Outlook. 

Sorry if my answer sounds too simple. But if you are not familiar with Photoshop might be happening to you that for whatever it is not loading your image at 1:1, that is, zoom 100%. Double click on the loupe icon to see it 100%, and then see if the chunky look dissapears (if so, file is ok, is just you were seing it slightly zoomed) Other reason could be you'd be converting it somehow to indexed colors. Or it would be a transparent gif, but when seing in picassa or Windows is seen over white background, then on photoshop with the transparent checkerboard, small size, etc, it might look like chunky . In that case, just convert image mode to rgb, add a layer bellow, fill it with white color, and double click loupe icon to ensure a 100% zoome viewing. It could be the way how you are saving it from picassa. Maybe not the final high res, but it's tricking you to save a thumbnail instead of what shows in the browser... 

A pitty, because DownloadHelper is absolutely great for this. It's actually (typically C:, but can be whatever) C:\Users\whichever_your_user\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\which_ever_your_profile.default\Cache "whichever your profile" is a random like string (ie: "iufrweriowej") , and for you to "guess" it, I recommend you just go to C:\Users\whichever_your_user\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ , so there you will see which is the exact profile name. "whichever_your_user" is Harry, Joe, or whoever is the user of your windows. There, if you set the folder view as "details", you will see as well the size. A youtube video, even if small, is going to be of several MBs of size, so it's easy to spot. You can just copy and paste one of the latest, biggest files, if you do it inmediately, (and you order by date modified) , place somewhere else, and in the case of youtube and many streaming videos, just rename to have .flv extension. To playback an flv you totally need an external player, VLC is a very good one, and also serves as a general many-formats video player. Edit: In older Windowses can be : C:\Documents and Settings\your user\Local Settings\ Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ 

If understood your last question, with vector safe you only might mean keeping the "vectorial" operations inside Photoshop, as all output you have from Photoshop, is raster, not vectorial, unless you export as AI file, but that would be only paths, not fills. At least in the CS versions I know (a bit old ones). Anyway, photos aren't vectorial, so not much of a point in exporting so. If is to keep the paths related features, ie, if you resize the image, the start gets resized, and the edges of the star, will be sharp, and do a nice crop out. (although an enlarged photo adds blur by itself), or, you could rotate the star with vector arrow tool, resize that arrow shape, modify as wished, that the mask would be applied automatically. To do this: 

It depends on the brand, on your actual home internal cables status, and other factors. It works pretty well for typical usage. Yet though, for gaming I would say it can, depending on the case, get you lower pings, or in some cases, collisions or micro cuts. Only important if your game depends a lot on very good ping and stability. The same pair of powerline goes pretty good in one home, not so well in another. Be sure though to connect directly to wall socket, having the adapter plugged alone. Doing differently will most possibly bring your a lot of problems. In typical circumstances, I'd say provides better gaming experience than wifi, but worse than direct cat 5 cable connection, which I prefer. Ham operators (amateur radio operators) complain that these devices do produce big interferences (in aprox. 500 meters near the house having them) in their radio communications, becoming a more serious problem in case of disasters, were often emergency communications can only be made by radio.
