Given that IMIX distribution, they send unidirectional traffic using pre-defined NAT + HQoS + ACL configurations on the router, until the CPU reaches 75% load. Take special note of the unidirectional nature of the test traffic, this unidirectional traffic is relevant to the next answer. 

Finally, a useful google query in case you're interested in how I found the first link... ospf lsa maxage 

Using SNMP to manage LWAPs has been helpful, since I can automatically react to changes in LWAP to WLC mappings, as well as when an AP drops offline or gets large error / user counts. I usually poll them all every 15 minutes and record who is on them, as well as recording what LWAPs are on each controller. The WLC is powerful, but I like building custom-reaction scripts and reports. 

At the time (1986), the internet was completely classful and nobody really gave much thought to allocating this much space to the loopback address. Thus, the loopback got an entire Class A network. 

I really don't like how Cisco crippled EIGRP in the ipbase image... at a minimum, you should get some kind of warning that your configuration won't work, but they haven't done that either. As you discovered, prevents EIGRP from advertising downstream routes from the switches connected to your distribution. You can trick EIGRP into advertising routes it learned from other rotuers (even as a router) by using a stub leak-map... 

Question 1: I have a basic question about ECMP, say I have a /20 route and also a /16 route to a host, and both are reachable, can ECMP load-balance between different prefix length or is it like, hardware first determines the route through LPM and then only applies ECMP? Quoting rfc 1812, Requirements for IPv4 Routers, Section 2.2.5.2 

Demonstrating a successful login after the 120-second quiet period Two minutes after being blocked, I can login again... 

When we start scaling to potentially thousands of LSAs, even small memory savings are important. Note that OSPF hellos are still sent on a stub networks, and they are capable of forming neighbors / transitioning to a transit network unless the interface has been administratively marked as a passive interface. OSPF Host Routes - Cisco's "Stub Host" So now we still have the original discussion about the Stub Host, which also happens to be an OSPF Stub Network. This concept comes from RFC 2328: OSPFv2 - Section 9.1, where it discusses various interface states... 

As you may already know, one of the requirements to use all the available wifi US 5GHz channels is supporting DFS on the Access Point; when DFS is enabled, it scans active and inactive 5Ghz channels for a minute at a time to ensure that there is no conflict with any radar signals which may also operate in this spectrum. If radar pulses are detected, that channel is black-holed for at least 30 minutes. DFS detects radar operating close to our site; however, I'm curious whether there is a list of DFS black-holed channels in the WLC... so far, I've been turning up a big zero... all I can find are SNMP traps from the controller... 

Thus whether you use the proposed discontiguous Area 1 is just a matter of taste... some people find it illogical to use the configuration in your diagram; these people might suggest that you keep OSPF area numbers together... so you'd have to change [area 1, subnet 3] on Router #3 to [area 3, subnet 3]. Other people see no problem with reusing Area 1, since OSPF area numbers are only locally significant to the router originating OSPF hellos. Either way, we should admit that OSPF is a remarkably flexible protocol; regardless of choosing one side or another in this debate. 

Sadly, I cannot easily renumber the Vlans on D1. The perfect solution would be to somehow translate Vlan951 on 4507:Gi1/2 to Vlan51 on 4507:Gi1/1. Cisco has a feature called vlan mapping, but it seems to require QinQ... all my services are simple dot1q... the 4500 vlan mapping docs are not clear about how they handle simple dot1q encapsulation. I know I can translate the vlans in the 4500 via loopback cable, but this burns two extra ports per Vlan... a total of ten extra ports for all the Vlans in the service (v51 - v55). Question Refer to the diagram below. 

It is a very simple, but still reliable protocol. There are times you may get stuck at the Cisco IOS rommon prompt (either for debugging, or because of an error). Rommon is a tiny environment itself; rommon images are typically around 500KB. Sometimes you wind up transferring files from within rommon; thus you need a small file transfer protocol like TFTP if you want the protocol to fit inside rommon. By using tftp, rommon can use a much smaller IP stack (UDP and IP, without TCP). 

Using Facebook as an example... We police their bandwidth to a small fraction of our total directly on our ASA (because another group in the company owns the web-proxy). I normally lookup the ASN of the company (Facebook is 32934), then I go to and find their prefixes. From that list, I build a Cisco ASA object group, which I can use to classify traffic... This is what I'm using now... Facebook gets throttled to a small amount of bandwidth... It works very well. Every so often, you'll have to go back and check robtex AS-info to see whether they have added or removed prefixes. I usually try to take the largest aggregate block they have, even if they are only announcing smaller blocks from that larger aggregate. 

You have answered your own question without realizing it. 1000BaseT cannot exceed 1Gbps, because 1000Base-T refers to hardware standard (IEEE 802.3ab). IEEE 802.3ab includes specifications for not only the cabling, but also the chips in your NIC, which terminate the cabling. Now can someone else come along and create a protocol standard for Cat5e, which exceeds 1Gbps? That's possible, but we can only speculate about the future.

References Registries operate in accordance with RFC 7020, which replaced RFC 2050. Arguably, much of the structure around these restrictions comes from RFC 7020 Section 2, Goals: 

It doesn't have to be that complicated. As long as your switch isn't using a feature similar to Dynamic ARP Inspection, the simple way to detect addresses is to use ... you can find this in most linux distributions (although CLI options sometimes vary depending on what build you have). 

Besides the original RFC 1918 space (which is now updated to RFC6890), there are several other blocks such as 192.0.2.0 that are not announced publicly. Furthermore, it's possible that someone has valid IPv4 space that just isn't announced in the public internet. The simplest thing to do is , login as and look for yourself... for instance, this is some "192" space that's announced by AS7018 (AT&T)... 

exec mode is used for and commands. There are multiple privilege levels associated with exec mode. These command privs (and who can use them) can be managed with Cisco's AAA features. config mode is used to enter configurations from the CLI. Individual config commands can be limited with AAA features. The two modes are useful so you can assign privileges to network engineers and administrators, based on their skill sets and the needs of the company. As an example, Tier-1 NOC personnel typically shouldn't be allowed to go into configuration mode, but network engineers typically have full config privs. 

Five minutes after the iSCSI session starts, S2's CAM entry for PC1's mac expires out of the CAM table and S2 floods PC1's traffic out all ports (in this case to Po1, Gi0/3 and Gi0/4). If PC1's iSCSI session consumes a lot of bandwidth, this unknown unicast flooding can suck non-trivial capacity from the links to PC3 and PC4. Cisco IOS switches have a default CAM timer of 300 seconds... 

Theory By convention, a collision domain is a contiguous wired and / or wireless half-duplex segment (typically using CSMA/CD), which is a subset of the subnet or vlan's broadcast domain. 

Non-portablility isn't about sales... it's a technical term. Address Portability Non-portable IP addresses belong to a certain organization, and an end-user of the non-portable IP address is not permitted to discouraged from announcing those IP addresses to another organization without the owing organization SWIPing the addresses to the end-user. The concept of portability comes from the ARIN Number Resource Policy Manual 2014.1, Section on IPv4 (emphasis mine)... 

When you see "Duplicate address" and "transmit/recieve loop detected" on the same interface, that's almost a slam-dunk that this is a cabling problem. Looped circuits are very common when dealing with WAN providers. It typically happens because some technician is testing the circuit with a loopNote 1 at their cross-connnect and gets pulled off to perform some other task. However, the loop prevents your circuit from coming up on both sides. The switch is complaining because it (correctly) considers it a problem when it sees it's own packets received on the interface it was sent from. The best thing to do is work with the provider and tell them you've detected a loop at this location. If the provider resists (not uncommon), ask them to perform a loop at on their panel at this site towards the other site. If the circuit is indeed correct, you should see your other switch link up (assuming you don't have UDLD on it, as you stated). After the loop is corrected, just shut/no shut this port to test it again. This problem illustrates a good use-case for out-of-band connections to your WAN sites through another carrier. This way, if you need to diagnose your far-end circuits, you've got some way to connect to your far-end router / switch. 

Documenting to help future googlers, since I could find no information about online... I managed to find the solution while I was typing the question above. I remembered that the Sup7Es had IOS-XE 3.2.2 loaded when I pulled them out of the boxes; the other important fact was that 3.2.2 would not turn up the OOB interface on FastEthernet1 while I was staging / licensing the supervisors. Solution First I loaded 3.2.2 on the switch again, and booted into it. Then I did a to zero and reloaded. When the switch rebooted was gone :-). 

Technically with IOS 15.2, the answer is "yes, you can know what interface you're configuring" but admittedly my solution involves a rather unpleasant kludge-fix. I will demonstrate how to use EEM version 3.2 to print out the interface name that you last configured. I do not pretend this solution is perfect, but it gets the job done. Example: 

You have a problem with the 1.1.1.9 configuration as an external NAT IP on the Mikrotik. The outside interface of the Mikrotik is a /30; you're using 1.1.1.9/30 as the default gateway and an outside NAT IP on the Mikrotik. If you're going to use 1.1.1.9/30 on the Mikrotik, you need 1.1.1.10 as a default-gateway. As it stands, you're currently using 1.1.1.9 as both default-gateway and external NAT IP. Current Routing table: 

Have you got a physical switch that is rated for Cat5 cabling? The answer to your question is the same as the answer to my question. More than likely you need to buy an electronic relay, and I know of some rated for Cat5. 

Some DHCP clients do not reliably disclose the OS information at boot. As was mentioned above, there is some intellectual property associated with these techniques; for instance, Infoblox and Cisco ISE can build client OS profiles based on the dhcp packets they see. Actually Cisco ISE includes some fairly sophisticated OS classification algorithms, if you can send more than dhcp to it. Alternatively, you could use a heuristic like the Windows endian bug in the "seconds elapsed" field, but relying on an OS bug is a poor way to handle OS detection. If you really must detect the OS without a dedicated vendor appliance, just issue an IP address, and scan the host with NMAP after sending the DHCP Ack. Using HTTP headers is not as reliable as nmap, because anyone can change the UserAgent string if they want. nmap is not 100% reliable at OS detection, but it is about as good as you will find if you must choose a single method for everything. I would make this a configurable option on the server since some folks may not like a default nmap scan on every DHCP host. Example nmap OS scan against Windows7: 

Wifi operates in (mostly) open spectrum bands from the FCC... bluetooth, microwave ovens, phones, toy cars, we can only speculate about the source of the interference. You could try using a directed antenna with a focused beam (i.e. a yagi, or a cantenna) on your stations... those might help if the interference is not in the direct path to your wifi source. Finally, if you have a wireless sniffer or access to a linux system (suggestion: Backtrack Linux LiveCD) then you can diagnose your wifi problems with Wireshark / tshark. Cisco also has a good reference for Wireshark 802.11 display filters, which help filter out noise so you can focus on the problems at hand. 

Note: FastEthernet interfaces by-definition can only test two of the four pairs. GigabitEthernet interfaces can test all four pairs. Older switches don't have a tdr function... you'd have to test the cabling manually. 

Since 172.16.2.2 still exists in the OSPF LSDB, OSPF installs a route for it. Note that there is a difference between 172.16.2.2/32 and 172.16.2.0/23 in the output of : 

Forces the Brocade to proxy-arp for every destination in 10.1.0.0/16 as if it was directly connected to . I can't respond about Brocade's ARP cache implementation, but I would simply point out the easy solution to your problem... configure your route differently: 

Assuming you have the correct IOS and feature set (IOS >=15.0(1)M7 & Adv IP Services license loaded), the simplest way to do this is by putting each internet link and Vlan in a different VRF (this is a VRF-lite config). Assume you want to use: 

As you mentioned, your static routes break, because there is no existing way to force failover to the WAN link at both sites when one site looses the uplink to the internet. The best solution to this problem is to set up some form of routed tunnel (sourced from the ISP-link addresses on R1 and R2 in the diagram) through the internet, run a dynamic routing protocol (OSPF / EIGRP) through your tunnel and backup WAN, and set the routing metrics for the WAN link to be much higher. 

Short answer: No, not with OSPF alone Long answer: The only way for OSPF to dynamically calculate paths based on latency / congestion is to use MPLS Traffic Engineering with offline optimizations of MPLS TE costs based on your criteria; MPLS TE uses OSPF LSAs to carry information about the label switched paths. However, MPLS Traffic Engineering is a heavy hammer and many network operations can't deal with the additional workflow introduced into provisioning or troubleshooting MPLS TE. Another answer suggests that you should not adjust link costs based on bandwidth, and to use the role of a node for costs. I can't speak for his network, but this guidance is unnecessary in many cases since the lowest cost path in a well-designed topology automatically follows through the core of the network. I wouldn't try to adjust an inefficient topology with link costs... just make traffic flow through the core naturally and ensure that OSPF sees a 1GE as a better path than a FastEthernet link. This will naturally happen if you lay out the topology well, and use auto-cost reference-bandwidth under the OSPF process. Be sure you use this on all OSPF routers so they understand the link costs in the same way.
