Ok, so I've been dealing with this for a while and I'm sorry if it seems like I'm asking the same question over and over (it sure feels like I am) Is there a way for my users to run the LDAP query that populates a dynamic distribution list from their machine to see a kind of 'preview' of the members in the group before sending their email to that list? 

I have a distribution group that is built from an OU for the Finance department What happens when Bob from the Admin OU is acting as the stand-in supervisor for the Finance department? He needs all the emails that are going to the Finance distribution group, but he needs to stay in the Admin OU because he's only temporarily part of the Finance department. 

I have network enabled printers and I'm wondering what the best way is to deploy 'em I can deploy them using GPOs that map the TCP port with the printer's IP address (how I'm doing it now) I could deploy them using Print and Document Services and AD I could deploy them using the "Deploy Printers" in GPO What are the benefits and drawbacks of each and what are you using? 

We want to use Lync Attendant for our front desk but I'm confused on how to set this up. We usually have one receptionist that's up there, but when she goes to lunch, there can be any number of different people covering the front desk. I'm wondering if I should set up one account called 'receptionist' and have anyone covering the front desk log into that account. The drawback of that is that the people can't work on their things when they're up at the front desk. I can each have them log into the computer front desk computer. That way, they can work on their own things AND answer calls. The problem is that they'll have to log into the phone up there too. That sounds like a pain. So I wanted to see how anyone else solved this problem. What are you guys doing for your front desk? 

I'm sitting here across the office from Bob, who is logged into the domain right now, working away. I pull up AD Admin Center and take a look at Bob's account and it tells me his last log on date is 10/25/2010 at noon. It's currently 11/2/2010 at 10 in the morning. My date on my server is correct, the date on his computer is correct...What's going on? 

I have an image of Windows 7 with Office 2010 installed that I'm trying to push out to my domain users but when they open Office for the first time, it asks them for a username and password for an administrator account. I know that it's not critical and they can get to the program without imputing the username/password but my users don't. To eliminate the support calls I know that I'm going to get, is there a way to bypass this? Even completely eliminate the 'first run' BS that Office has? 

I'm running Exchange 2010 and I give full access permissions to the HR mailbox to John. John only accesses his mailbox through OWA; he doesn't even have Outlook on his Mac. How does John view the HR mailbox through OWA? 

I've got an RODC in our local site and a PDC in our co-location facility. I run SET on any of the computers in our local site and they all say LOGONSERVER='PDC'. They should all be authenticating to the local RODC but they don't seem to want to. I looked at the logs of the RODC and I get a few spaced out errors coming from NETLOGON: 

It works! When I was looking in the restore section of Windows Server Backup, it didn't show the documents. But, I did a little test-recovery of my own files and the folder with my documents showed up with all of the documents inside. The user that is doing the backups has to be a part of the backup operators group. That group can evidently backup documents that it doesn't have access too. Hope this helps someone in the future :) 

Using Exchange 2010. I have a single-domain cert for mail.mydomain.com now and I know I need more than that. I want to get a wildcard cert but I've got a guy that's telling me that wildcard certs won't work on cell phones. I want to support iPhones and Android phones; will one wildcard cert do the job? The more I read, the more confused I get. Can someone help me out? 

Also, if anyone else was having problems with this, I've found another thing that may prevent TCP/IP printers from mapping correctly. A user cannot add a printer to the computer they're on if they're not an administrator on that computer. When trying to add the printer manually, they will be asked for the username and password of an administrator. When the GPO is adding the printer on login, it cannot ask for an administrator account so it just errors out while trying to add the printer. The Point and Print Restrictions GP under Computer>Policies>Administrative Templates>Printers is your ticket to solving this problem. Set the When installing drivers for a new connection: and the When updating drivers for an existing connection: settings to Do not show warning or elevation prompt and it will install the printers just fine. 

I can access it, but I cannot write to it. Windows keeps telling me I "need permission to perform this action" Where do I start? 

Found out that it was what everyone was suggesting. When I made the Staff distribution list from a standard list to a dynamic list, something got messed up. I went into OWA, brought up the nickname cache (little pop-up menu when typing in the address in a new mail) and hit delete on the name, it removed it from the nickname cache. When they tried to send again, it sent to the correct list. Thanks for everyone's help! 

I'm trying to get SSO to work with Office 365 and Sharepoint online and I'm getting really confused. My internal domain is "internal.com" and my external name is "external.com". external.com is added as a domain in O365, but internal.com is not. Should I put internal.com on a external DNS server and add it as a domain in O365? Would that make it so my internal users wouldn't have to sign into external.sharepoint.com? 

The Local and LocalLow aren't supposed to roam with the user. M$ has said that the data stored in these folders are usually too large to roam. See this: Word Document 

I'm creating a new Exchange 2010 environment to replace the DeskNow system that my company is using currently. I don't have any experience with Exchange at all. I have the main roles installed and they appear to be working internally. AD is doing its job; I can hook up Outlook 2007 with next to no effort. I can even get to OWA. By all indications I have a working internal mail system (that nobody is using at the moment). Now I want to be able to exchange mail with the Internets. I've been reading a few books on the subject and everyone says that I don't need an Edge Transport server - but that's as far as they go. They don't tell me how to set up Internet mail exchange without the Edge Transport server, they just go right into how to set one up and how to use it as an SMTP gateway. So I turn to you. How does mail get to the Internet without the Edge Transport server? What goes in my DMZ? And, if everyone agrees that I need one, can it be a virtual machine or do I need an entirely new server? 

I have seen a consistent spike in traffic over my network since Monday morning and I don't know where it's coming from! I don't have netflow routers (like I would like), I have IPCop firewalls. Is there any way that's built in to Linux that I can see where the packets are coming from/to? Like a built in packet capture? If there's not, how do I go about finding where this traffic's coming from? 

Thank you Chris S and minamhere for your responses but I must not have been clear on what I was trying to accomplish. I was actually looking to suppress the welcome screen that asks users about the update settings and such. I found that if a user clicks the biggest button there (use recommended settings) it asks them for an admin username and password. My solution was the Office 2010 ADM template. Download, add it to your GPO and enable the "Suppress recommended settings dialog" policy and it works like a charm :) 

I'm trying to install Exchange 2010 to a server in a site that uses an RODC. It tells me that "No domain controllers for the domain DOMAIN and the site SITE are available" I'm going to be moving the Exchange server to the site with the main RW DC soon but I wanted to install Exchange before moving it. Is this possible? 

I have a bunch of linux virtual servers left over from a previous IT department. They have names like 'magic' or 'stuff'. I'm not quite sure what they're doing...or if I need them... How would you guys and gals go about finding out the purpose of these machines? (besides turning them off and seeing what breaks) 

First of all, everyone's on Exchange 2010 using OWA I have a dynamic distribution list that contains all users in my domain called 'staff'. I can send to this list, other people can send to this list, but I have one user that cannot send to this list. Sending to this list gives the user an email back with the error: 

I have network drives mapped to my users. If they lose network connection for any reason, it pulls up the client side cached version of it and lets the user work in that. Now some duplicate files are popping up and people are seeing inconsistent versions of things. I want to make it so that when a user loses network connection, they can't access the files. Period. EDIT I forgot to mention that my file servers are Linux-based samba shares 

I've looked for his profile everywhere and cannot find it to delete or fix it. System Properties > Advanced > User Profiles shows my profile, the Administrator profile and the Default Profile. HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList only shows my profile and the Administrator profile. Everything that I've found on the internets points me to those locations. Help a brotha out? 

A while back I was in a conference call and I clicked on the 'people options' menu in the call window and selected 'mute audience' to mute everyone while I gave a lecture. Now when internal users call into my conference call in the conference bridge (using the 'join online meeting' link in the email that's created with the 'new online meeting' button in Outlook), they join muted. I've tried unchecking that box, but everyone is still muted when they join the call. I've tried changing my conference information (using the 'Reset my Assigned Conference information' link in the dialin options) to give me a new conference ID but that doesn't help; people are still joining muted. Is there an attribute somewhere that I modified by muting the audience once that I have to change back to make it so that members don't join the conference muted? 

I want to see a list of the model numbers of all the monitors attached to the computers in my firm. Is there an SCCM Query that will do this? 

EDIT One Exchange server inside the network that acts as a transport server, client access server and mailbox server and one Edge Transport server in the DMZ. 

I've been looking for a way to update third-party software on my client computers for a while. I want to do some monitoring, push Windows updates for my client computers and push updates for things like Flash, Java and my virus scanning software. Eventually I want to push programs like Office out to some of my client computers. It's my understanding that SC will serve these purposes, so I have a few questions for it. 

I know that title may sound pretty dumb but I'm not looking for "create a dynamic distribution group!" as an answer. Let me explain. A question I posted a little bit ago confirmed that you cannot expand a dynamic distribution group. Because I have a boss that seeks impossible things to ask for, he wants to be able to see the people in the distribution groups. I want the low maintenance of a dynamic distribution group, but I also want to satisfy my boss' [insert harsh word here] request. I was thinking maybe a PowerShell script that deletes the distribution group and then recreates it based on who's in an OU. I run it every time we hire/fire someone? Or is there a way that I can keep the dynamic distribution group and then create a standard distribution group from that every time someone gets hired/fired? Someone has to have had this [insert harsh word here] request before, can you help me out? 

Has anyone had to deal with a corrupt file system on a storage gateway volume? One of my volumes is now telling me that it's corrupted or unreadable. I've tried running a chkdsk /r on it and it took days (10TB volume). Once completed I got the same error message. I didn't have snapshotting scheduled so I don't have a previous version of these files. I'm currently working with AWS support and they're having me run chkdsk a couple of different ways. Has anyone had to deal with this before? PS: BTW, don't run a chkdsk on a storage gateway volume, it screws up your cache and runs very slowly
