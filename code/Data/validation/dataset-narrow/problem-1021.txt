What operating system are you using? What playback software are you using? You do realize that unlike DVDs, Blu-Ray support isn't baked into any mainstream OS and requires special software to watch commercial movies, right? It's also possible you're trying to view HDCP content on a non-HDCP compliant device. If you are using correct playback software, what is your video adapter and monitor, and how are they connected? (If I'm misinterpreting your question, and you DO in fact have some playback app installed, and correct hardware, please edit the question to reflect this and myself or someone else can provide a better answer.) 

I don't believe, short of brute force attempts, that there's any way programmatically to do this unless you're already an admin. So, you'll have to call IT. (The defaults vary depending on what they've got set up, although if you know that I guess you could look up the defaults and try. No guarantee that they haven't changed it, of course.) 

While @Alex Howansky's answer made me chuckle endlessly, I think what you're really looking for is something like SMART diagnostic data, which is a predictive failure tool. Any modern drive that supports it will WARN you if it thinks something is wrong based on a pattern of small failures...major head crashes are still basically impossible to predict, though. 

The built-in system file checker is usually pretty good about fixing isolated problems like this. From an administrative command prompt, just run . 

The only easy way to do this is with the Lenovo recovery DVDs (and you'd be looking a complete reimage then so it's largely impractical). If you didn't burn these when you got the system you'd be looking at purchasing them from Lenovo, which last I checked was about US$50. I have no idea how difficult it is to get that partition booting with any OTHER bootloader - there may not be anything particularly special about it in and of itself, but I don't know of any way for you to get it to respond to that Thinkvantage keypress. Fortunately, there's not much of use on that recovery environment that you can't get in other ways anyway. 

You can't connect HDMI between them because that's not possible - the display on a laptop will only accept an input signal from that laptop unless you physically alter the internals of it. The ports on the laptops are for video output, not input. The only way to do this, therefore, is in software, and there's no simple native way of handling that. There is some third-party software that will emulate this kind of functionality, and it really depends on how you need to use it. A: If simply using a single keyboard and mouse would be sufficient, and you don't need to actually move windows between the systems or access files from one on both, etc, you can use something like Synergy (which you mentioned) or Multiplicity as a kind of virtual KVM. B: If you actually need the screen from one to override the other, then you need something more specialized. The only tool I've ever found that seems to work more than halfassedly is Maxivista (it's limited in how many secondary screens it will do but if you're only talking about the two laptops it'll probably work fine). Note that pretty much any solution is going to require the two to be on the same LAN - an ad-hoc wireless network would probably do the trick in a pinch. 

I just got a chance to test in Vista and Win, Win again (to lower the start menu but keep it focused), then Tab seems to work for me. 

It will be more than adequate for displaying general use things like text documents, emails, spreadsheets, and webpages. (By comparison, I think these are an order of magnitude faster than USB->DVI external video adapters and THOSE display full HD monitors just fine.) Resolution isn't actually that important when you're just doing static rendering. You might possibly run into trouble with, say, real-time graphs of the stock market, because that's some heavy 2D drawing, but even then my hunch is you'd be fine, with at worst some barely-noticeable hiccups. I wouldn't count on it running Crysis too well, though, but you don't seem concerned about that. 

This will vary from board to board, but there should be an explicit BIOS option for "Intel SpeedStep" or "EIST" that you can disable. EDIT: Also, I believe you have it backwards. SpeedStep is responsible for downthrottling, not upthrottling; you'll run at the base clockspeed if you turn it off. Turbo Boost is what upthrottles (but I believe SpeedStep does have to be on for that to work). DOUBLEEDIT: You shouldn't need to, but you can also try disabling C1E support. 

In theory the specification allows it; in practice your motherboard would have to expose the functionality to something application that would let you adjust this, and I have never seen nor heard of either. 

Unfortunately, the only way to be sure is to try, or ask around and see if anyone else has tried. I find that most newer cards based on the same or similar chipsets work fine; for instance, I just dealt with a customer of ours today using a Quadro NVS 450 and Quadro NVS 295 in the same machine with no problems. 

Yes, any slot can downclock - you can use dual x16 cards fine and they will run at 8x. You can probably find a board that supports 16x/16x but it'll be more expensive due to an extra chip needed, and the performance difference between 8x and 16x on the kind of workload you describe with a card like that is about 1% or less (basically, not worth the expense). 

If by 'browsing something' you mean online, probably your LAN driver is really lousy and throwing lots of DPC activity which can cause audio stuttering. This may just be something you have to deal with based on your exact PC specifications - note that the NEWEST driver may not be the BEST in this case, though - try uninstalling it and using the default Windows one. You can use DPC Latency Checker and try disabling devices one at a time in Device Manager to see if you can find what specifically is causing the spikes. 

This doesn't work - Ivy Bridge processors only support DisplayPort 1.1, so no daisy-chaining. (Haswell does, though, so likely the next iteration of Surface will support this). 

Silly question - you are using the DisplayPort port on the laptop rather than an adapter, right? Also, you did update the VIDEO drivers, right? (Monitor drivers are usually only color profiles and can actually cause more harm than good - try removing that as well.) 

Basically, it doesn't matter what the partition arrangement is - you can't do something like "stripe writes across multiple partitions" on a single disk to get a speedup. There's still only one read head on one arm. That's your speed limit - everything else is superfluous. The only way to get more speed is more heads, hence more drives. (Or just move to SSDs, of course) 

It's just that weak, you're exactly right. The read/write head is VERY sensitively calibrated, and even it can't pick anything up unless it's perfectly in alignment. We're talking about regions measured in nanometers or smaller here - even if they were strong enough, they'd cancel out in aggregate at the distances in question anyway. (In fact, they're so small in modern hard drives that they're sensitive to THERMAL perturbations, which is why most drives these days have redundant magnetic layers on a single platter.) 

This depends more than anything on the exact SKU and the ports it has. In theory, the chipset will support six displays all running at 2560x1600 or better (a card which almost certainly would be six mini-DisplayPorts, and there are a few floating around out there), but just because it's capable doesn't necessarily mean any six-port card will automatically be capable of it. EDIT: In response to your edit - do you have DP1.2 capable monitors? I'm not aware of anything on the market that supports daisy-chaining aside from the current Apple Thunderbolt displays...and you can run two of those daisy-chained to a single port. I believe this limitation is in the DisplayPort 1.2 spec, so theoretically anything that supports it should have exactly the same limitation - two monitors of that resolution per channel. (Basically, this is exactly what your chart says). The card might be able to push more but it's outside spec, so don't assume that it will. 

Probably there is some process running that's thrashing the disks - I concur with the previous answer of Process Explorer. One other possibility, though, since you don't specify that you hear heads clicking, just noise from the disks - if you have power management settings set to max performance oftentimes the disks will never spin down (this prevents any delay on the next disk access). This should be configurable in the advanced power options. 

I'm guessing this is a dual link DVI adapter, but you're not running at a dual link resolution. There are lots of single link adapters that don't need extra power - these are able to draw enough power from the DisplayPort connection itself on the GPU. So, I'd guess it's able to operate alright without the USB connection until you try to hit really high resolutions. I can't imagine it will cause a problem but there's no way to guarantee that without checking with the manufacturer of the adapter. Regarding the hard drive issue, I'm guessing this is a grounding problem with the adapter (I've seen similar behavior from poorly made DP to miniDP adapters and traced the problem to a pin not being properly grounded out, this was endemic to most manufacturers for a while.) It could be something weird with the USB controller too, but that seems less likely. 

I've had no trouble getting 16GB of RAM to work on a W510 (which is largely the same as a W500, but those only support 8GB and I don't think I've tried more than 6GB on one...), but I've never tried these particular DIMMs. (I have never had luck with Corsair.) I was using Kingston, personally. Really, though, the best thing to do is buy the RAM directly from Lenovo - it may be slightly overpriced, but it will carry the warranty coverage of the laptop if you do this! 

The odds of failure are negligible - I would feel comfortable juggling these things barehanded. If I could juggle, anyway. Even if it has failed, the odds of it damaging any other components are also negligible (more likely the machine just wouldn't boot). 

Some cards are capable of three (or more) simultaneous outputs, some are not. This one is not. This is really just down to the specific card, but the vast majority of current generation ATI cards support 3+ outputs if you're using native (or actively converted) DisplayPort connections (this is usually branded as EyeFinity). Nvidia hasn't been as good about supporting it, but there are cards that support it as well in the current generation. Going back a few generations from any non-Matrox manufacturer, it's really hard to find non-workstation cards that support more than two outputs - it's only relatively recently that this has become fairly commonplace. This is generally a physical limitation of the number of TMDS clocks on the card. 

They're pretty much exclusively found in server environments, and not particularly often these days either. 

If you ONLY want to keep the recovery partition and have the Windows installation clean, I'd still recommend you do this, and then do a factory recovery on the new drive (or vice versa if you don't care about the contents of the original drive) 

Are you actually switching users or logging out and back in? Have you tried setting up the monitors as one user, logging out, setting them up as the other user, and rebooting the machine? It should be saving these settings separately. I'll test this out myself in a bit, I think I have a similar video card kicking around here someplace. 

Probably, as you suspect, this is either a thermal problem (it may be that the sink under the fan isn't making good contact with the CPU, or an errant sensor, or something else) or an electrical problem somewhere on the motherboard. It could potentially be a problem with the battery or AC adapter - you can try removing one, then the other, and seeing if it helps. Regardless, you're better off getting it serviced by the manufacturer given its age.
