It will install, but the problem is it will reject the key. An OEM key requires an OEM disk, and retail requires a retail disk. You did not post what model or brand of laptop, so it is hard to be more specific with the following advice: First, I would call the manufacturer and see if I could buy a replacement disk (about $20 typically because you are not buying a license, just the media). That is a good idea long-term. In the short term, you want to get up and running, so see if you have a friend with an OEM disk even if it is not from your manufacturer. I have used the Dell restore disks on non-Dell systems before. The main difference is that if I were installing it on a Dell system, it won't ask me for the key or to activate, but it does on a non-Dell system. This is not a problem for you since you can just put in you key that is on the sticker. 

Unless you bought an upgrade, you are correct that 1366x768 is the maximum resolution. $URL$ (go about half way down to the "Display" section) 

OK, now that you have posted your ipconfig, I see that you are using an internal network, which is good. This is the big problem: 1) Do you you have a DHCP server set up? Right now, you are getting a 169.x.x.x address, which means that Windows is not getting an IP address either set statically or from DHCP. It gave one to itself...it is called a local link, or automatic private addressing. It is to talk to other computers local to it that have no configuration either. Make sure your network driver is up-to-date. Make sure your netmask is 255.255.255.0. You can test by pinging 127.0.0.1. If you get no reply, your network card is not set up correctly. Then ping your internal default gateway of 192.168.1.254. Your NIC could also just have died. Once you have that, you can set a domain in your DHCP server options of mydomain.local. If you are using a static IP address, go to the IPv4 settings>advanced>DNS settings and enter mydomain.local into the Append these DNS Suffixes. It is more for Windows server domains, but it should allow your network to identify itself. 

On a domain like truecrypt.org, you cannot see the actual website trough https, but when you download the signatures of their files or their pgp key, they will send it to you through https. However firefox does not seem to give me the possibility to look at the certificate in this situation. What is a practical way of looking at the certificate, preferably without having to install extra tools... 

I often have to post files on different sites and some websites' forms only have a browse button to upload from your computer. If I have the file on another website, usually I have to go: 

for public keys and: for complete keys (including private part). Where you can supply (partial) fingerprints for KEY1, KEY2 etc. 

Using debian wheezy and iceweasel, I somehow managed to have it no longer redering text in pre tags. It still shows the background but no text. This is no color problem, I cannot select anything. I can see the code using "show selection source". I have already tried reinstalling the iceweasel package, and running in safe mode, but to no avail. As a sidenote, it might be more than just pre, the textarea for asking and answering questions on stackechange have it also. The cursor just stays in the left of the textarea and I only see what I am typing thanks to the instant preview. Recent changes to my system is that i tried to install monospace fonts like consolas and inconsolata, which failed (they show as boxes), and that I played around with the system default fonts in gnome tweak tool... However changing settings doesn't resolve the problem on first sight... Tor browser bundle, which has a completely different profile as well as executables also has it. I tested by making some monospace text with css and it still shows monospace fine... Another textarea on a site I am building works fine, I don't know what is special about the ones on stack exchange. I know I am very talented in making software break, but it is really incredible how it can break in such ridiculous ways though... Any clues more than welcome, I am flabbergasted. 

I don't think the signal strenght will be an issue, but using a DVI-splitter cable might give you better looking image, but they are known to have some issues (cheap ones atleast). I don't think there should be any problems as long as you don't try to run 1920x1200 resolution (your 1024x768 will work nicely) through that setup and use reasonably high quality cables. Actually, at 1024x768 you probably wont see any quality improvement even if the signal was kept DVI all the way. 

Connecting old SATA HDDs is fairly low risk operation, but if you want to minimize the risk, use an external USB-SATA dock. The most likely (still very unlikely) problem that might occur is your OS corrupting the data on the drive. This can be mitigated by mounting the drive read-only with eg. Linux live-CD/USB-stick. 

If security isn't a requirement, like in your case of running virtualized OS. You can open the X11 windows directly to your non-VM Ubuntu screen. This should in theory give you the best possible speed and lowest latency, though in some cases I've noticed that VNC does better job. The only drawback is that without some extra helper apps, you cannot close the connection the app and reconnect later. Lets assume that your VM Ubuntu has IP address of 10.0.0.2 and the "real" Ubuntu has virtual interface IP 10.0.0.1 and is the GW for the virtual machine (this would be something you would have with NAT mode. With bridge-mode, both OS have IP given either some external DHCP server, or they are set manually). On your non-VM Ubuntu you need to use xhost command to allow incoming X11 connection from the VM, to do this write on terminal application: 

If you want your digital canvas work more like reallife(tm) ones, I would suggest out trying Corel Paint 11. I used it and if I had any more skill, it would be my #1 choice for tablet painting. 

In alot of senses it will be exactly like as if it were a normal drive, so you could lose unsaved data and the file system could become corrupted. It can be kind of annoying if an encrypted file system is corrupt and won't mount anymore, but I if I'm not mistaking truecrypt offers some option to decrypt data without mounting it so you can get on it with traditional tools to recover data. I cannot really give you good references here, but that is from my memory of how truecrypt works. I wouldn't be surprised if the truecrypt documentation talks about this. 

Boot from a live disc into some linux system to verify it is a windows problem. Reinstall drivers Try to roll back SP1 or did you mean you installed the whole windows 7 recently? Verify there are no hardware conflicts, like several devices on the same irq sometimes causes trouble. In that case try throwing a bunch out and letting windows reinstall them sometimes assigns different irqs. If all else fails, you will have to find users with the same problem and hope they have a solution or debug the system which I suppose you don't want to do. (Google is your friend...) 

I am using a usb-stick based operating system. So I use different computers and network connections. If I use Vuze for example, could a remote entity (eg a tracker) track my movements by seeing some sort of unique identification for my Vuze installation appear at different ip adresses? If so, is there a way I could change id everytime I start the program to avoid this problem? 

At some point today my email client warned about an smtp certificate change of self signed certs. I took a screenshot of the certificate fingerprints and refused the connection because it does not seem to make sense. The server in question has a valid https certificate, but on their website nothing about their smtp cert, nor about it having changed. Now if they answer me that they didn't change it, this is probably an ssl injection and I would like to send them details including which exit node did this. It would also allow me to compare with tested exit nodes like this service: xqz3u5drneuzhaeo.onion/users/badtornodes/ I must have a default tor logging settup on linux. Where can I find which exit node I was connected to at a given time? /var/log/tor/log seems to have only warnings and upwards in it... 

What you want is Dorgem, it should work on Windows 7 too, works nicely on 64bit Vista and many other Windows versions I've tried it on. Dorgem can be downloaded here $URL$ 

If you could have a Linux fileserver, you could put the FLAC files there and share the filesystem over MP3FS, it would transcode the files into MP3 on-the-fly when needed and there wouldn't be any need to store files multiple times. Unfortunately I haven't seen a similar thing for Windows. My solution there would be to write a simple script that monitors the FLAC-folder and would detect new files and transcode them to MP3 every night or something of that sorts. Not as handy. 

I recommend using dvdisaster to add recovery record into the ISO image before burning it. DVDs that have been "enhanced" with dvdisaster can withstand multiple sector errors and still be recovered. Also you can verify that disk with the application. Only drawbacks are that you lose about 5-15% of storage capacity per disc depending how much you add recovery info and you need to create an ISO image first. Fortunately you can easily create a script that will enhance the ISO and then burn it automatically, so the inconvenience is minimal. And you sleep better as you know the media will still be readable after couple years. 

Previously I've been able to open links just by clicking them on Terminal.app. After updating my OSX, the terminal now gives Quick Look as default option for links. Is there any way to disable Quick Look on Terminal.app or change the order of actions on the context menu so that Open URL would be first option again? 

RSYNC is pretty good option for backups, especially over the LAN or internet. Preferrably you need some kind of unix machine to backup to though there is now pretty good Windows option too. With rsync you can easily do rotating backups with hardlinks, that way you can have a full backup for every day of the week, or every week of the year, and there is not much overhead, the data is only stored once on the server. There is plenty of guides and tutorials on how to use rsync on Linux and for Windows I highly recommend DeltaCopy, a GUI for rsync server/client. My usual setup makes weekly backups of not so important stuff to a server on my LAN and critical files like emails are rsynced to a hosted server in another country, just in case my town gets hit by a meteor. 

Also, have you considered configuring login auditing? $URL$ If none of this works, it would be very helpful to see the format you are using for theSQLername to log into the SLQ Manager, and the SQLCMD string you are using. Of course, change anything specific, except it the username is "sa". One more question: One SQL server environment, or multi? I found some of this here, but weeded through to find only the things that I thought could be relevant: $URL$ 

First, this is REALLY stupid that Microsoft did not just allow multiple copies in PowerPoint, and make this easy. So it is not just you. You can go to Start>Programs>Microsoft Office, and hold the SHIFT key down, and right-click on "Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007". Choose "Run as" and choose a different user, who can open the file. Then click Office Button>Open and navigate to the file. I tested this successfully. I like Jonsca's comment that just copying the file seems easier. 

Just to be clear: MSDN is not licensed for you to let all your friends install using the keys you would get, but yes, you have access to a great range of ISO's to re-install using their keys. You would have access to virtually every OS, every version, going back to DOS, except for ones (95/98/ME) excluded by a settlement over Microsoft's virtual machine (Java settlement). Also, although the activations never expire, technically, you are supposed to renew your subscription yearly to keep using the software. This is not MSDN, but TechNet. This is VERY similar to MSDN, except that MSDN has virtually every language under the sun. There may be some other difference that I am not aware of, but based on the sample screenshots, I suspect that you will be well-served by TechNet alone. One other benefit other than it is only about $325 ($250 renewal), so much cheaper than MSDN, is that you also get two Microsoft Support cases yearly. So you can call them for support at no cost twice (regularly $260 per call, so worth it for this alone). These are sample screenshots of the download pages, which are very similar for MSDN. Note the all editions for the OS, and Office. This is one of my greatest tools for learning. 

I had a debian squeeze, and decided I wanted more modern software versions. I set my repositories to testing and started to run all the updates. I further installed some software. No gnome extensions except for tweak-tool. I definitely rebooted during this whole process. I have my debian on a usb hard drive, so I then took it on another computer and when I logged in the desktop showed only the wallpaper. The black bar on the top disappeared upon clicking "login" and about a second later the black mousepointer turned white. Next nothing. I see the debian wallpaper (the login screen one), not the one I had set up in gnome, and nothing else. No panels, not app switcher, no right click, nothing. I can go to tty with cntr-alt-Fx. Now I brought it back to the machine where I had it working before, but that has the same problem now. I looked around in the logs and on the web, but found nothing much special. Tried restarting gdm, tried reconfiguring gdm and xorg with dpkg. No avail. Im pretty stuck with an unusable system... any hints appreciated. It seems some other people have asked about similar issues, but the answers don't work for me... ps: is there a way to turn on fallback from the command line? 

in a terminal tab that I always leave open (and opens automatically on boot) so I have realtime feedback of all logging from systemd on my computer. If desired, you can use the match filters from journalctl to limit the noise, but for now I like to have everything at hand. 

Eg. have firefox take the file from the cache or download it silently and upload it transparently. I hope I won't have to write that myself... 

Somehow I had uninstalled the gnome-session package, probably by uninstalling evolution. After reinstalling that it worked again.
