The constant scans are a way for SQL Server to create a bucket into which it's going to place something later in the execution plan. I've posted a more thorough explanation of it here. To understand what the constant scan is for, you have to look further into the plan. In this case, it's the Compute Scalar operators that are being used to populate the space created by the constant scan. The Compute Scalar operators are being loaded up with NULL and the value 1045876, so they're clearly going to be used with the Loop Join in an effort to filter the data. The really cool part is that this plan is Trivial. It means that it went through a minimal optimization process. All the operations are leading up to the Merge Interval. This is used to create a minimal set of comparison operators for an index seek (details on that here). The whole idea is to get rid of overlapping values so that it can then pull the data out with minimal passes. Although it's still using a loop operation, you'll note that the loop executes exactly once, meaning, it's effectively a scan. ADDENDUM: That last sentence is off. There were two seeks. I misread the plan. The rest of the concepts are the same and the goal, minimal passes, is the same. 

Online backups require that the database be enabled for rollforward recovery. However, this is not the default when you create a database. In order to do this, you need to set the database configuration parameter. Once you have done this, you'll need to take one offline backup (i.e., no users can be connected). Once you've completed these steps, you'll be able to run online backups as you wish. You may want to spend some time reading the Data Recovery section of the DB2 Database Administration guide to help familiarize yourself with DB2 Backup/Recovery. 

Sounds like you are not properly deallocating objects like , , etc., so your application is holding open statement handles in the database. This will eventually exhaust "CLI Packages" in the database, resulting in the error. The proper solution is to make sure that you close these as soon as you're done reading them. You may also find documents suggesting that you rebind to increase the number of CLI packages at the database level, but keep in mind that this is just a band-aid. 

That will return information not just about when the stats where updated, but their size, density, how selective they are, and the histogram that shows the distribution of data. With all that, you can determine if those stats are up to date and effective. 

It looks like the statistics are off. From the plan you posted it's estimating that it's going to read 64,000 rows, but it's actually reading zero. That's a very wide disparity. I'd suggest a few things. First, update the statistics with a full scan. Any index rebuilds ought to have taken care of that, but with this disparity I'm wondering if something is up there. Next, make sure that the constraints are all in place (although, this plan isn't referencing constraints since it's a straight index seek with a TOP operation). Finally, capture the wait statistics for the system to see what's actually causing things to run slowly. You can use extended events to capture the wait metrics for just this query, so that's an even better approach. Also, a 64,000 row range scan from a seek is a little excessive unless you have millions of rows. However, this could still be a part of the statistics being off. 

This applies to DB2 versions that have storage groups – DB2 10.1 and newer. For DB2 9.7 (this will work with DB2 10.1 and later, too), you could extract the storage path(s) for the database and see if any container names do not start with the storage path(s). You could also consider the container name; automatic storage tablespaces will have a name that looks like: 

Using and from the main section of the output, you can calculate the total space. (You can ignore the sections that give details for each container in the tablespace). If you have SMS tablespaces that store table data (i.e. not just system- or user-temporary tablespaces), you'll see tablespaces in this output that show . To calculate the amount of data used by these SMS tablespaces, you will need to dump out all of the information from the backup image using . You will get lines like this: 

Side By Side Upgrade and Migration from 2008 to 2016 Old Server Name Test1 New Server Name Test1 Default Instance Test 1 My question is when the new server be named as the old one 'Test1" and it will try to register the dns while the old server is online wont be there a problem as the name is already being registered. In that case what will be the workaround since it is a side by side upgrade and migration I need to use the same server name and need to use both the servers in order to upgrade and mirgate and then turn off the old server after the switch over 

DESCRIPTION: SSPI handshake failed with error code 0x8009030c, state 14 while establishing a connection with integrated security; the connection has been closed. Reason: AcceptSecurityContext failed. The Windows error code indicates the cause of failure. [CLIENT: 10.XXX.XX.XX} ***The client address is different on different occasion Can i refer this problem to my network admin? is this a network issue or a sql server issue. Is there any other way other then changing the registry ? Can i safely ignore this error ? 

Between the and the command, you will execute all of the commands. If your database resides on a filesystem that does not support fast file allocation (for example: AIX JFS2), then these operations can take quite a long time if you have large containers – DB2 is formatting the tablespace containers. When this is happening you'll see lots of I/O on your system, but no apparent activity on the database restore. 

For the second problem you may want to look at using the function so you can calculate the delta in the log record: 

This is the classic question / fight over whether monitoring should have a monitoring agent installed on each server, or if it should be "agentless". With an agent installed on each server, a process/script/etc. wakes up every so often, collects data, and reports it back to a central location (i.e. monitoring server). With an agentless solution, the central server polls each monitored server/database/etc on a schedule to collect the information. Cacti and Nagios typically use this solution. There are pros and cons to each method. There is not necessarily a best practice for which method to use, discussion usually just results in a holy war (similar to Emacs vs. vi, DB2 vs Oracle, ...). 

Lately I have been facing failed connection errors mainly due to servers using NTLM Authentication. In our environment the servers have a combination of ntlm and kerberoos. My question is If i ask my Domain admin to manually register all the service accounts to use the kerberoos instead of ntlm authentication will there be any problem or any performance issues that might arise ? 

what permission should an application login have on sql server. Should I assign database reader and writer role only or database owner ? I will be using a sql server authentication as the application will be using asp.net. 

Is it necessary to put the database into single user mode before restoring a database? If so which one is more preferable putting the sql server into single user mode or putting the database only into single user mode before restoring ! Thank you. 

I'm also not quite sure why you are posting this without just attempting it, but yes, this will work without problem. The only issues you might have are: 

The reason for this behavior is that DB2 must have enough space for the largest possible LOB locator in the column for the row in the table. INLINE LENGTH is not like a VARCHAR where space is used only according to the amount of data. It's like CHAR – the size you specify is reserved in every single row of the table. From the documentation (scroll down to description of ): 

If you are asking if you can determine if the table in question has any triggers defined, then yes - you can either 

Whenever I restore a database all my logins associated with that database are removed. How can I avoid this ? 

Our test server is running on sql server 2014 but I am planning to install sql 2016 on the production server. The application is a .net in house application. My question is can I go the above setting or it is mandatory to have the same versions 

2 Node - Cluster 1- Node1 2- Node2 VirtualInstance Name Test\Node- Will be the Publisher\Distributor SNaphsot Folder E Drive (Shared Drive ) - Repldata Subscriber The service account of the subscriber should have read write permission on the 'e' drive . Question- Will I be giving read\write permission based upon the virtual name that is 'Test' on the above case 

If the storage group ID is , then the tablespace is not using automatic storage. Don't consider and . Check (this works on Linux/UNIX, but not Windows - sorry): 

This example adds a calculation showing how much the logrecordnumber has grown since the week before. Doing the rest of the calculation (extrapolating to when LSNs might run out) is left as an exercise for the OP. 

You need to use the explain facilities in DB2 to answer this question, it's highly specific to the actual queries you are executing, and you can't get a general answer. IBM i 7.2 (and previous versions) have Visual Explain. If you are restricted from doing this, then you need to speak to the system or database administrator for your environment.
