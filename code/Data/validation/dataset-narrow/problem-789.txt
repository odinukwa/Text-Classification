I have a brand new Dell VRTX box set up as a Failover Cluster running HA Hyper-V virtual machines. This is my first time setting up clustering, and my first time with one of these boxes, so I'm sure I've missed something. The virtual machines are experiencing high disk latency and bad performance when accessing their VHD(x) files located on a Cluster Shared Volume. The VRTX has 10 x 900 GB 10K SAS drives in RAID 6 configuration, and the VRTX has the redundant Shared PERC 8 controllers. Both blades have full access to the virtual disks. There are two M520 blades installed, each with 128 GB RAM. MPIO is configured for the PERC 8 controllers. Operating system on the blades is Server 2012 (NOT R2). The RAID 6 array is split into a small (8 GB) volume for cluster quorum witness and a large (6.5 TB) volume for a Cluster Shared Volume (mounted on the nodes as C:\ClusterStorage\Volume1) An example of slow disk access: logging into a Server 2012 VM and having Server Manager come up automatically. Disk access goes to 100%, with write speeds at 20 MB or so, read speeds of 500 KB or so, and Average Response Time of over 1000 ms, sometimes spiking at 4000-5000 ms or so. It's the latency that really worries me. Is there something specific I should look at in my configuration? It doesn't seem to matter whether I use VHD or VHDX, dynamic or static. 

The web service writes its own log file, and I can see that small messages are processed fine. Larger messages are not logged at all so I guess that something in Apache rejects them before they even reach the web service? Things I've tried without success: (I've restarted Apache after every change. These steps are incremental.) 

I'd like to allow registrations without my approval; instead, the user must get a mail with an activation link. I'd like a designated moderator group to approve all posts made by newly registered users. This should be done through the forum's web-based moderation control panel. When a new user posts a spammy message, I want the moderator group to kill the message and the account. When a new user has posted a few non-spammy messages, he's whitelisted and further postings require no approval. 

However, I don't see the value anywhere in . What more can I try, to get the web service to receive large messages? 

I have a HP Wireless Access Point 420 (J8131A) and I am facing the problem that its admin interface uses either an ActiveX plugin or a JAR file - I'm not sure because none of browsers on none of my machines can load it. Even on Windows + Internet Explorer, having turned off any and all security settings, I can't get the admin menu to load. And without an admin menu, well, it's mostly a paper weight. Can you give me any tips on how to progress from here? I'd like to avoid ditching the unit but I realize it may be the only option. Your comments are much appreciated! 

Changing the BOOTUP line to something like eliminates the formatting for all init scripts. If you just want to disable formatting on one of your scripts, add: 

Windows 2003 domain controllers do not seem to utilize IPv6 fully. Exchange 2010 needs to see all subnets containing domain controllers in Active Directory. But then Exchange was trying to contact the 2003 domain controllers via IPv6 and failing. When I removed IPv6 from the 2003 domain controllers, things started working. A 2008 R2 domain controller worked fine with IPv6. 

In our network, we have several Cisco 1721 routers located at branch offices connected back to the main office via T-1 circuits. All the 1721s are running the same IOS and configured the same, with static global IPv6 addresses on the LAN interface. Here are the relevant configuration items: 

I am trying to get Exchange 2010 to change the MessageClass (PR_MESSAGE_CLASS) of an incoming message to that of my custom form (IPM.Note.MyCustom) when the incoming message has a certain header set. () I have seen some information about setting another MIME header () that Exchange will use to set the MessageClass, but it doesn't seem to work for me. (I've seen examples that use and ) I've even looked into writing a transport agent with C#, and I did find a property on the class, but it's read-only. I also looked at added a MAPI property in a TNEF section, but the Exchange API does not offer a way to create a TNEF section if one does not already exist. (And most mail from the Internet doesn't.) There's got to be a way to do this. What am I missing? 

To limit Internet usage of our users to a reasonable amount since they are using our sister agency's Internet connection when doing general web stuff That we never under any circumstance permit packets to be routed from our primary LAN to the Extranet LAN. 

What are you trying to do? I'm trying to enable DNS scavenging on a DNS zone that has about a hundred stale DNS records. What have you tried in order to make it happen? I setup DNS Scavenging per everyone's favorite TechNet Blog post: Don't be afraid of DNS Scavenging. Just be patient. I first disabled scavenging on all of our domain controllers: 

Again - I'm either not understanding how the whole Global Condition/Requirements logic hangs together or it is just this unintuitive but the above Requirement should be able to look at all the Strings returned from the property, evaluate if any of them contain 'Firefox' and if so happily deploy Adobe Flash Player Plugin. Unfortunately it doesn't work. Almost all of machines in the Deployment return the following error: 

Did you have any other equipment reboot due to the power outage? It almost sounds like there were VLAN tagging settings required for connectivity on a network switch that were lost because no one wrote the running-config to memory. First make sure that you can access the Hyper-V host. You need to verify that your management interface hasn't been accidentally set to an Internal or Private interface in Hyper-V's Virtual Network Manager. Once you who have successfully verified that you have connectivity to the host you can move on to the VMs. Verify that your two NICs that are designated for use by your VMs are "External Connections" in Hyper-V's Virtual Network Manager. Make sure the checkbox "Allow management operating system to share this adapter" is also enabled. You should now be able to ping or connect to the IP address for both of these NICs. Then confirm that Virtual Network or Virtual Interface you are connecting to each NIC is added to the appropriate VMs.
