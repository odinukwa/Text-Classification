For the most part, which logging method you should use really depends on your environment. I've worked in shops that only used SNMP Traps, shops that only used Syslog events, and shops that used both (sent to two different servers under the control of two different departments). It will depend greatly on the NMS/Syslog server you are using to gather this information, and what you wish to monitor in each Cisco device. 

Now with all of that said, you may have all the frames that are being transmitted, but you would still need to decrypt the frames. This a large topic in and of itself, however the basics are this: the frames that any 802.11 station sends into the air are sent encrypted so that not just anyone can sniff all connections. Wireshark has a nice intro page on Decyrypting 802.11. I recommend reading that, understanding it, and moving on from there. 

System Version is actually CUCM Version . You'll need to download System Version or higher, to get the OS and Application fixes that are found in CUCM Version . I wouldn't go so far as to say that there is always a 1-to-1 relationship between the two formats (CUCM Version vs System Version). However, in my experience, when Cisco releases a new System Version, they also increment the CUCM version number. In older versions of CUCM, there was a much greater disconnect between "OS Fixes" and "CUCM Fixes", which would give you the disparity that Michael Luo describes in the page you linked. However in recent times (post version 7.1 days), all of the recommendations that I have received from Cisco TAC, seem to indicate that the higher the number, the better, period. 

In short OSPF Areas allow you to segment your network topology to enable greater scalability and maintain a greater level of control. 

Short answer: Unfortunately with your current equipment you're out of luck. Long answer: From what I'm seeing on D-Link's website for the DWL-3200AP, this AP is pretty basic and does not support the type of QOS functionality you're looking for. Also in looking at the Tech Specs on Netgear's website for the CG3000DCR, you're utilizing a very basic combo Modem/Router. As other folks on this site have pointed out, this type of equipment falls into the "Pro-sumer" niche. While these devices are on topic for this site, and are arguably more powerful/feature rich than normal consumer gear, they fall very short of "Enterprise grade". So as your needs increase for network segmentation, QOS, and any other dozen features, you will begin to feel the hurt from these devices. If this is a feature your business needs, you may want to look into putting a more powerful/feature rich network and wireless solution in place. 

However, a good answer to "What is the advantage of OSPF Areas?", is this quote from the Cisco Design Technote, What are OSPF Areas: 

What this means is that an MPLS node can make forwarding decisions based on labels, not on L3 routing information, but it will still require an L3 routing protocol for creating the path. MPLS cannot create IP routes where none exist. (Nor can it re-route traffic to where no previous IP routes exist.) The key to answering this question is in understanding what MPLS is and how it functions. I would recommend checking out Cisco's MPLS FAQ For Beginners and then for more in-depth reading, RFC 3031. These cover your question (and others) in some depth. 

Edit: In response to your comment "How can OSPF Areas increase the speed of communication?": By itself, using OSPF Areas doesn't increase the speed of communication. It removes roadblocks to communication/scalability. Think of it like this (this isn't a perfect analogy, and over-simplifies the issue, but it should help give the general idea): If a company takes hundreds of telephone calls each day, and has to send all of it's telephone calls to a single secretary, calls into the company will be slow. However if there is a central secretary who knows about many secretaries who all take calls for a different portion of the company, calls can more quickly be processed. A similar issue arises when routing tables for any one device get too large/unmanageable. Splitting them into more manageable areas can help speed traffic along to it's destination. 

Unfortunately, you'll need the StackWise cables to stack 3750's. (And the StackWise modules as well depending on your switches.) See this Cisco white paper on Cisco StackWise for more information. 

This question is akin to asking, "Why can't I use a screwdriver to hammer nails?" You could use OSPF in certain inter-AS situations if you REALLY, REALLY wanted to/needed to. There would be many "gotchas" and caveats to keep in mind when utilizing OSPF as an EGP. Just like you could hammer nails with a screwdriver. However, you would risk breaking the screwdriver, harming yourself, etc. You could do it, but why would you? There is a perfectly usable/heavily implemented routing protocol created for inter-AS communication, BGP. Why attempt to utilize OSPF for an undesigned purpose? 

The easiest way to achieve this would be to separate the clients into different SSIDs/WLANs. Place the clients who need addresses from the Built-In DHCP server in one, and the clients who need addresses from the External DHCP server into another. This way, you could point the Proxy DHCP server IP address wherever you need it to go depeding on which client is requesting an address. (In my current environment at $DAYJOB, we're utilizing a similar configuration. We're actually sending the proxy DHCP request to 3 different locations depending on the SSID.) You could change the destination for the DHCP requests either on the Interface corresponding to the WLAN or on the Advanced tab of the WLAN itself. 

A standard TCPDump, without any modifications to the mode of the Wireless NIC, will not display ALL frames traversing the wireless network. It will only display frames directed at (and capable of being received by) your station. TCPDump is just grabbing the information that is specifically delivered to your station, decrypted, and presented to the OS at the normal Ethernet/IP level. To listen to ALL frames reaching your station on the wireless network, you'll need have a NIC capable of running in Monitor mode, and then put your NIC into Monitor mode. While in Monitor mode, you won't be able to send traffic, only to observe all frames on the channel. This is done similarly to the following: 

In general, if you are utilizing Cisco Secure Desktop, this opens up a whole world of options to give you restrictions based on the device. Just as an example off of the top of my head, you could do the following. I haven't had the opportunity to test this configuration, however I have seen similar configurations in the field. 

So it appears they don't even recommend using it for DHCP; probably because of odd behavior such as you are seeing. At the very least, it is an extremely limited feature-set. Most work-arounds for your problem would be to configure the trouble clients with statically configured IP addresses/fixed leases in the DHCP server. However there is no capability for that in the Zone Director 1100. The best way around your problem at this point, would be to configure the Zone Director for DHCP Relay. Once the Zone Director forwards the DHCP requests to an actual DHCP server, you would have much greater control over the DHCP process. 

Now, there are several ways to get the information you're looking for, and it depends on what exactly you know, and what you're trying to find. If you know what the voice VLAN(s) is/are on that particular switch, and you're looking to find out what ports they're assigned to, you could simply issue the command: 

Do you need QOS on a dedicated VoIP network? Possibly not, but you probably want it in place. It really will depend on the network layout/capacity, the complexity of your phone system, the volume of voice traffic, and your business needs. Here is the most basic example I can think of: If a link is so saturated with calls that call-control traffic can't get through, what happens? You should ideally still use QOS to give call-control traffic a guaranteed portion of each link. If you do not, you could potentially wind up with all sorts of unexpected call behavior. (Dropped calls, one way traffic, etc, etc) Another consideration is, do you control the entire network? If this is multiple sites connected across some sort of MPLS service, you may need QOS to prioritize your traffic within the provider's network. (Which they'll gladly sell you at a cost.) The bottom line is this: Do you care about a specific portion of your network traffic reaching it's destination? Then QOS is your friend. 

This means that in your example, after Step 4, C knows that the link to D is down and increments the Sequence number appropriately. Then, utilizing the RERR method described in section 6.11, C sends a message to the other routers letting them know that the route to D is bad. Thus avoiding the loop. (It has been many years since I've looked at AODV, I might be wrong/rusty...) 

This will either spit out a list of information about the limits in place, including the failed encrypt/decrypt packet counts, or it will give you the following: 

Edit: After further research, my original answer is not exactly accurate. It looks like Cisco TAC would like you to use the same hardware, but I believe it is not a requirement. See the 6500 VSS FAQ, which was indicated to also apply to the 4500 series. 

Short answer: MPLS is not a Layer 3 Routing protocol, however, it requires one to establish it's paths. -- Per RFC 3031 Multiprotocol Label Switching Architecture: 

Phase II Lifetime: Phase II Lifetime can be managed on a Cisco IOS router in two ways: globally or locally on the crypto map itself. As with the ISAKMP lifetime, neither of these are mandatory fields. If you do not configure them, the router defaults the IPSec lifetime to 4608000 kilobytes/3600 seconds. Global configuration: 

I highly recommend checking out this article over at INE that goes over the details of "Inside" vs "Outside" interfaces in Cisco NATing. 

So there should also be some .tcl files on the router which these services would use to execute their functions. If you want more general information on Cisco's CVP product and configuring IOS device for PSTN ingress for it, I would recommend this config example/call flow guide. 

Check out the Feature Navigator on Cisco's site. I've found this to be the only way sometimes to compare which feature is available in each image/license level. Choose the feature(s) you're looking for from the list at the left, then click continue. After that you'll be able to drill down into the IOS-XE platform -> ASR1001. You should be able to tell if you need Advanced Enterprise or Advanced IP there. 

You're partially right in that Syslog and SNMP Traping do serve similar functions, however there are some fundamental differences. (Based on your commands/tags on the quesiton, I assume you're asking specifically about their function on a Cisco Router/Switch.) SNMP serves three main functions as you mentioned: 

Read the documentation on for more information, and also, see this page for some good information on using for monitoring, with an example. As noted by @ylearn in the comments, your station will only be able to capture frames under specific circumstances (Some more obvious than others): 

The command you're looking for is . If you change this setting in Global Configuration mode, it will suppress the confirmation alerts you're seeing and allow one line, automated file operations. However, it is worth noting that for the most part, the confirmation prompts are there to protect your system and "CYA"... If you feed the wrong information into your file operations, you could potentially interrupt service on this device. If you do disable the file prompts, I would make sure that one of the last steps in your script is to reset it to the default of . See this Cisco PDF for more information. 

Original Answer: The switches should be the same model. A 4500E should only form a VSS pair with another 4500E, and likewise for the 4500X. Best rule of thumb for making VSS function properly: Use Identical Hardware. I've heard anecdotal evidence that VSS can be forced to work in other configurations (that is to say, it may be allowed via software), but I doubt Cisco TAC would support them. 

My organization is soon going to be deploying approximately 600 new Cisco 2602i access points in a CAPWAP deployment with several 5508 controllers. This is an infrastructure refresh; currently we have a mix of older Cisco AP's using CAPWAP with several sets of WiSM controllers. Our current procedure for deploying new/replacement AP's is, to my understanding, the standard priming procedure as listed in this Cisco Support Forum document. 

The term you are looking for to describe this behavior, is an Outbound Campaign. There is no built in functionality in Cisco Call Manager (CUCM) itself to do this. However, both of Cisco's Contact Center products do have this ability. Unified Contact Center Express (UCCX) has a more limited capability for performing a Campaign, but is a much cheaper, much simpler solution to implement. It is still not cheap or simple though! For more complicated out dialing ability, you'd want to look into Unified Contact Center Enterprise. At that point, due to the cost and complexity of UCCE, I'd recommend involving a Cisco Partner to design and implement the system for you. 

Now, if I the interface between ASA1 and R4 that cost from R3 to ASA1 increments. No shut the interfaces from R4 to ASA1: 

Open device in CUCM, find the field "Phone Load Name" under Device Information. Manually assign the phone to use 8.5(2) firmware by entering "SCCPXX.8-5-2S" where XX is the model of the phone. (11 for 7911, 42 for 7942, etc. but note that 7962 and 7965 models still use the "42" or "45" firmware respectively.) Apply configuration and allow phone to upgrade to 8.5(2). Remove manual Phone Load entry, apply configuration again and phone will upgrade to current release specified globally in CUCM. 

Now, for your answer: When there are two (or more) DHCP servers accessible from a particular L2 segment, it becomes a race condition. The Client issues a broadcast DHCPDISCOVER and then waits. Both DHCP Servers receive the message and broadcast DHCPOFFER replies. Whichever DHCP Server's DHCPOFFER packet is received first by the Client will "win", and that Server will receive a DHCPREQUEST from the Client. This can actually cause a Denial of Service condition depending on the circumstances. In a past job, I worked in the NOC of a regional ISP. We utilized a particular brand of DSLAM which had a software bug that caused it to not filter DHCP messages coming from the customers. This meant that anytime a customer plugged their home router in backwards (LAN port to the DSL Modem, instead of WAN port to the DSL Modem), they began to issue DHCPOFFERs to every router attached to a modem on that DSLAM. Because this new Rouge DHCP Server was significantly closer to the customers than the actual DHCP server, it won the race every time. This caused a cascading outage as DHCP leases expired on routers on that DSLAM, and they acquired private addresses from the Rouge DHCP Server.
