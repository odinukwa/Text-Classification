first of all, for real time applications (audio , video ..etc) you must use UDP not TCP (where TCP is connection oriented ) . second,the only thing you should care about if you run such applications is the throughput and if WIFI connection could handle this through put or not ??? , your audio and video rates as you listed will never exceed the throughput of the WIFI where b/g stander are 54 MBPS and a stander is 150 MBPS third, regarding run single connection or multi connection , i guess you should run each type of application on single connection , network wise it is better from the side of apply quality of service and traffic control. 

regarding to HUB, all the devices attached to the hub are in one BC domain and one collision domain.regarding to the switch, each port is collision domain and each VLAN is a BC domain.SO as shown 

ip address X.X.X.X consisted of two main parts [Network part] , [host part] Network part can be consisted of two parts , fixed part called [network summary address] and tunnable part called [Subnet ID] , will reserved by host IPs . in your example you provide us with the network summary address 172.16. 64.0/18 and you want to subnet this address into 4 subnets (sub 0 ,1 ,2 ,3 ). let us present your summary address in other way 

dear i faced same problem but with 3rd party AP not aruba .taking into consideration our handheld can be connected wired and wireless, after alot of analysis we found that those handhelds generate huge multicast (icmp , TCP and UDP) traffic cause even switch CPU% increase to unusual percentage. the only work around solving this case , isolate handheld devices in separate vlan with separate DHCP scope with separate SSID ,may you configure your controller to be its DHCP server for this vlan . 

we have 4 collision domains, but the number of the BC domains is very depend. for example if sw1 and sw2 run same vlan on all ports so all this network run in single BC domain. 

simply you can think in RIP as an application has its own control plane (some thing making it up and run, like recognizing its RIP neighbors ) and has its responsibility plane (which is updating routing table from its RIP neighbors ), so its control plane Not necessary to be operate in its responsibility plane which is Layer 3 responsibility regardless the router as a layer 3 device it can also filter packet based on TCP or UDP ports, some routers have impeded security feature as well. you can think in router as a PC has its own processor and memory and I/O interfaces. run what ever protocol based on ISO suite. please make use of this conversation RIP - Layer 3 Protocol or An Application 

here i can gave you the basic steps you need and i'll guide you to how accomplishing this proccess By default most Cisco VoIP phones come configured for Call Manager, which uses the 'Skinny' protocol - SCCP. most of other PBX has 2 implementations for this channel • Skinny implements a very basic set of telephone functions and ships with asterisk. • SCCP has implemented more of the SCCP protocol, so some class 5 features (hold, transfer, forward, etc) should work. However, cisco phones can be reconfigured to use SIP (recommended for use with other PBX than CUCM): make sure you have the next 

after alot of clear arp , clear mac address-table dynamic no thing could happen .also handhelds still not working till I reload all switches . NOTES 

Check the location of your Wireshark install , make sure it is like tail.exe -f -c +0b %c | "D:\Wireshark\Wireshark.exe" -k -i - ,for your case. may you need also to shut down your windows firewall 

Regarding your first question local time on certain switch or switching equipment won't affect any switching Performance. You may face this problem and in the devices which are multi homed to multiple controllers such as access points assigned to multi wireless controller so all of wireless controller must have same clock for access points management issues and so. Regarding to your second question, if you didn't configure any time based configurations (time-based ACL , QOS , Routing , port shutdown) , changing time shouldn't affect any thing Regarding to your third question , Use NTP server as a clock provider to you network (switches and routers and servers ...etc.) is the best practice to grantee unified network time and date , . 

If the link flaps OSPF will run the SPF algorithm afresh to re-calculate the shortest path to all available destinations. you can change the throttle numbers to make the network more stable The default timers are below 

one needs to look at it from a historic perspective. 1) The original STP was designed by Radia Perlman working for DECnet. Then IBM & other vendors implemented their own versions of STP. 2) Then IEEE created their standard (IEEE 802.1D) for STP. 3) STP, as defined in 8012.1D standard was implemented as 802.1Q CST (Common Spanning Tree) for all VLANs by IEEE & as PVST by Cisco on a per-VLAN basis. Later, PVST+ was created to interoperate with 802.1Q trunks. But all these implementations, whether they're Cisco's PVST(+) or IEEE's CST, implemented the same mechanism (BPDU Structure/ STP timers/ Topology changes) as defined in the standard 802.1D. I guess that's why Cisco prefers to call their version (PVST+) as "IEEE", although RSTP is also IEEE (802.1w). Maybe, they don't want to change their code now to avoid creating any confuson, so they just prefer to write IEEE for PVST+ (Using old timers etc.) & RSTP for 802.1w (Using new tmers & synchronizations etc.). That's how I've understood it so far. Would love to hear some expert opinion though....maybe people who were around when the standards were created. make use of this discussion Cisco Learning Network 

as you said class A 255.0.0.0 but it has been subnetted to 255.255.0.0 so what you post is not class A it is simply classless network . usual subneting method in classless network is as following . 

you can use it to figure out channel utility and it DPI and it can help in find the places of the APs as well 

first of all i you must under stand that Router B has two type of connections , one of them between it and router A through satellite terminal with range of 172.x.x.x/24 and the another one between it and linksys which provide the internet. the way that make PC in site B access internet is NAT 192.168.200.x/24 range in the linksys router to its 147.25.x.x/24 IP.so you need to NAT 192.168.201.x/24 to this IP as well. guiding notes 1- try to ping the 192.168.200.1 from PC in site A 2- check the configuration done for 192.168.200.x/24 to access internet through linksys and do it same for 192.168.201.x/24 

3- A promiscuous port can serve only one primary VLAN, one isolated VLAN, and multiple community VLANs. Layer 3 gateways are typically connected to the switch through a promiscuous port. SO other port types (isolated port and community port) are the only available port types if this port is not promiscuous where 

TCAM table is designed to make the process of lookup for IPs involved in layer 3 function such (routing,ACL,QOS,filtering) more easier but return not only 0 in case of match and 1 in case of no match but also X in case of don’t care which mean (For example, a ternary CAM might have a stored word of "10XX0" which will match any of the four search words "10000", "10010", "10100", or "10110" (XX can be 00,01,10,11).) and also add little bits to the table entry width you can say a multi layer switch uses sets of TCAMs, each set of TCAMs are used for a certain feature (Routing, QoS, ACLs ...), and it does parallel lookups to get all the required results using the VMR combination (Value, Mask and Result), these results can be permit and deny in the case of ACLs, values for QoS policies in case of QoS or pointers to a next-hop in the routing table in case of routing NOTE you have conflict when you consider the TCAM entry width is directly related to the length of the IP address cause each entry is consented of 3 parts(Value (134 bit), Mask (134 bit), result (permit,deny)) and those three pars are varying from layer 3 function to another layer 3 function as shown in the next table .
