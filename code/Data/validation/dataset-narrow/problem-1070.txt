Because it worked fine when you manually paused it, here is a temporary hack that you may be able to use until the "right" solution is found. Generally using "delays" and "timers" like this is NOT what you would do for mission critical things. That said, until a better answer is found, you can do this and see if it works: 

You could just right-click on your Windows 7 Desktop, choose Gadgets, select the Clock to add it to the desktop, right-click on the clock and choose options, and give it a name like "US Eastern", or "Dusseldorf", and then pick the time zone you want the clock to dislpay from the list. You can add multiple clocks and configure each one to the time zone you need. 

You can create a custom Environment Variable and use that in the shortcut's path instead of hard coded version path. Use the %MYCUSTOMPORTABLEPATH% in the shortcut path itself instead. You can also keep part of the path fixed and just store the version in the Environment too. D:\PortableApp\%MYLATESTVERSIONNUMBER%\prog.exe Just like you can use %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH% in a shortcut path, you can also create your own vars. Just update your environment variable when you upgrade and the shortcut should point to new stuff. That said, having version-less paths may work fine too depending on your needs. 

You can try to use $URL$ to create a script that activates Outlook window, sends keystrokes to send/receive, then minimizes Outlook window or something similar. Then, create a shortcut to this script, assign it a hotkey key combination in the shortcut, and push those keys to make this script run real fast and then get back out of your way. 

John Guin at Microsoft (MSDN) wrote an import tool that should be able to handle this. His bug fix post with some screenshots: "Updating the OneNote Text File Importer" $URL$ And the link to the original post that has the updated code you can install: $URL$ 

If you choose to use a Local Account, you get a nice "clean" USERPROFILE path of: C:\Users\username If you then associate a Microsoft Account to that Local Account, will it maintain the original USERPROFILE path created above by the Local Account or will it try to CHANGE the USERPROFILE path to what it uses when using ONLY a Microsoft Account without a Local Account? Example - When adding an MS Account to Local Account will it try to change USERPROFILE: 

64-bit Windows 8 has Hyper-V (virtualization) built-in. Hyper-V only works if the host machine is equipped with a 64-bit processor that supports a feature called Second Level Address Translation (SLAT). [SLAT may also be known as extended page tables (EPT), Rapid Virtualization Indexing (RVI) and nested page tables (NPT)]. Does the "Dell XPS One 27 Touch" PC with i7 processor released in Q4 2012 support SLAT so that you can use the Hyper-V feature built-in to Windows 8? ** Note: I should have mentioned that I do not have this system and can't personally check it. The processor in question does support SLAT/EPT because it has the i7-3700S processor. Still concerned about the potential BIOS/Setup dependency though at the overall system level. When looking through the owners manual for this machine I do NOT see a specific setting to enable SLAT/EPT (unless it is named yet again something else in the Dell setup screen). So I was hoping someone who has the machine could confirm Hyper-V actually works. 

If you have Administrator access, one way to do it is to use a PowerShell script and run it with Task Scheduler. Typing that process with all the script code here is not something I can do right now but it already exists out there: First, create the PowerShell script that understands the names of your two network adapters by following these instructions: Hey, Scripting Guy! How Can I Enable or Disable My Network Adapter? Then, using Windows Task Scheduler, setup scheduled tasks that call the script with the desired parameters to enable and disable as needed: How do I set up a powershell script to run as a Scheduled Task in Windows? If you are willing to read those two posts and experiment, you should be able to get it to work. 

Your path name with ~'s in it ("~ALL~") may not be ideal. An easy thing to try is to extract these files into C:\VB6mouse Run console as admin, and try again with a path that doesn't have any uncommon characters in it. Do you get the same error as above if you try from this new path of C:\VB6mouse? 

Explanation By far the most effective and clean way to permanently disable Windows Defender in Windows 10 is via Group Policy, as described by Aaron Hoffman. Unfortunately, Windows 10 Home lacks the necessary tools. Here's a registry file that contains the changes made by gpedit.msc on a Windows 10 Pro machine. It's been tested on Windows 10 Home as well. Save the file as with Windows-style line endings and double-click it to import it into your registry. 

Issue 5: Windows Setings Sync I've heard that Windows Settings Sync has caused issues with icons for some people. I haven't been able to reproduce this, but you can check whether it's the issue by disabling it temporarily. It's likely that there's either some underlying setting that's the true culprit; it may be resulting in bad icons being uploaded. Reportedly, this primarily affects search results in Cortana and the Start menu. 

Open a File Explorer window. In the ribbon tab, click the button on the right. Select the tab in the resulting dialog. At the top of the list of checkboxes in the group, ensure is unchecked. If it's already unchecked, try checking it, clicking , unchecking it again, and clicking . Otherwise, just uncheck it and click . 

This may seem like an obscure fix, but the issue stems from the fact that AppX package logos are typically stored as PNG files. When this issue arises, you may also notice that PNG files are lacking proper thumbnails (you won't see previews while browsing folders in File Explorer). If the app causing the problem has installed similar handlers for other image file types, you can perform the same steps as above to the affected file extensions to restore the thumbnails. Keep in mind that this may affect the functionality of the app, so you may have to make a trade-off. Issue 2: Thumbnails are disabled in Performance Settings 

Right-click on the Start Menu icon or press Windows + X. A menu will appear. Click . Under the pane on the right, click the link. Click the link in the pane on the left. The tab should already be selected in the resulting dialog. Click in the group. Ensure is checked. 

It's time to reboot to make sure that everything works. You may need to update your BIOS boot order settings to match the changes. In my case, the BIOS settings were already correct, so I was stuck in a reboot loop; each time I wanted to boot my computer, I had to manually select the old drive with the misplaced EFI partition. If everything worked as expected, you'll be able to delete the old EFI partition. If it didn't work, or your BIOS is still configured to boot from the old partition, Windows won't let you delete it, even if you use the override flag in diskpart.exe. Since you probably want to get rid of that old partition anyway, deleting it is a great way to make sure you're booting from the new partition. 

Updated DNS block list; works as of version . Add this to your hosts file (typically something like ). Works best with IPv6, since is a "drop-all" prefix. Works with IPv4 as long as you don't have anything listening on . You can use , but I would advise against that, since the connection won't die immediately if you have another program listening on port 443. ( is loopback, not just .) 

For years, I've had the exact same issues with app thumbnails. Particularly for Metro-style apps (RT/UWP), I often see a blank or default icon, primarily in search results and settings. I've been troubleshooting it for years, with no success until now. I'm documenting this here because I know I'm going to encounter it again. When I search for a solution, I'll hopefully find this page. Background In Windows 10, UWP apps are shipped as AppX packages. This includes many of the new built-in apps (stored in ) as well as apps downloaded via Windows Store (stored in ). PowerShell offers several cmdlets that are useful for managing AppX packages. Throughout my troubleshooting, I found Get-AppxPackage, Add-AppxPackage, and Remove-AppxPackage particularly useful, especially since is inaccessible to normal users, even administrators. Before attempting these fixes, you should be comfortable editing the registry, working with the command prompt and PowerShell, and making backups. You should be prepared to wipe everything and reinstall Windows should something go wrong. Issue 1: Third-party thumbnail handlers for .png Some third-party apps like to install custom thumbnail generators. Some of these apps do so in a way that breaks things. In my case, Google's Drive File Stream was the culprit. Keep in mind that this is different from having a default program for a file; Windows Photos remained the default for me. To solve the issue: 

According to the Unicode standard, (the underscore character) is part of a word. This means that when you skip your cursor to the next word (in many interfaces you can do this with Ctrl + the arrow keys) you will skip over all the characters as well as the letters and numbers in-between. However, vim (where moving to the next/previous word is done using or in normal mode) regards not as one word, but as five: . I would like to configure Vim's behaviour such that is also properly considered a word character. How can this be done? 

I recently moved to a new computer, and copied over all existing git repositories for webdevelopment projects from my old computer. On that old computer, I had installed apache to serve certain folders from as subdirectory of my home folder as development websites (either static or using PHP). So, for instance, a personal project would live under . Now on the new computer, I tried setting up nginx, to use it in a similar way. I followed this guide on DigitalOcean to install nginx (and MySQL and PHP) on my laptop that runs Linux Mint 18.1 (Serena). I configured nginx as follows: : 

For a university-project, I am working on a web-service that crawls certain images and shows them in the interface. I now hit a little scalability-issue: The 150 GB SSD of the VPS is full. Luckily, I have managed to obtain a 1 TB HDD with the same hosting provider which is mounted using webDAV. However, I am now facing the problem of moving these 501974 files to their new location. Of course, I'd rather not have the web-interface itself break, so my idea now is: 

(I also added a symbolic link from sites-enabled to this: ). After restarting nginx (), and adding to my -file, I was greeted with a 404 error. Looking in , I find out that the requests I do fail because of the following reason: 

I am on Linux Mint 18.1 (which is based on Ubuntu 16) and usually browsing the internet through a VPN. However, recently I wanted to set up a simple server on my own computer that runs at a custom port. Now it turns out that (obviously...) using the VPN makes it impossible for people to connect to this port. So what I'd like to do, is to add an exception, that allows (only) this port to not use a VPN. Is this possible? 

To create a thumbnail from an image file, you can run the following ImageMagick command: . However, I am in a situation in which I want to limit how wide an image is, but the height is not restricted. How can I instruct ImageMagick to resize larger images to a specific width, without restricting the height? 

Note that even through you use systems like the above-stated, these protect your transport. What they do not protect against is how you interact with the sites. 

However, the actual copying step takes forever using . I've also tried but this also takes so long (it ran for multiple hours before hanging) that the shell session breaks beforehand. Is there another, smarter way to copy/move this large amount of files to its new location on another hard disk? The VPS is running Ubuntu 16. 

After this, testing by creating and (as shown in the guide) worked successfully. I now tried adding a domain for one of my projects. : 

No, this does not improve privacy. While, depending on the VM-software you use (and the settings therein), the VM might use a different IP- and MAC-address, which might make the connection slichtly anonymous (But do not rely on it!), this does not in improve privacy. As Hennes stated in his answer as well, contents of any non-encryped connection can be read (and possibly changed) by all intermediate persons, e.g. employers as well as Internet Service Providers. Using a SSL-secured connection (for websites, also known as HTTPS) prevents intermediate persons from seeing what you send (and receive), although it still does not prevent them from knowing where you connect to (as DNS-lookups, which map a name like to an IP-address like are usually not encrypted). Better ways of ensuring privacy on the internet are: 

Copy images to new location. Rename current directory, and give a symlink to the new location its old name. Remove the old directory. 

I expect this has to do with file/directory rights management in linux/unix. My home directory is obviously owned by myusername, while nginx is run by the user www-data. However, I am not sure how to alter the rights of this folder so that www-data/nginx is able to access it (and the files within). How can this be resolved? And why did I not run into this problem while configuring Apache on my previous computer (also running Linux Mint)?
