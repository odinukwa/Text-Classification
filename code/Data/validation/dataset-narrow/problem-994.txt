This was an idea brought up by a friend. Due to the CPU producing heat, one would think that it would be more energy-efficient to reuse that heat energy. Through what method could heat from the CPU be converted into electrical energy, which goes back into the computer? How much electricity could be produced, and would it be significant enough to go through the trouble of harnessing it? 

As you can see, there are two metal clips that hold the headphone plug. Over time and use, the metal will start bending outwards and lose its original shape. Best bet to fit this is to DIY, open up your laptop and bend it inwards, or send it to a repair shop. Preventative measures include plugging & unplugging your headphones only when needed. 

This can be done without the needing to install add-ons. Go to: about:preferences > Privacy > History > Use custom setting for history. Here, you can set blacklists and whitelists for accepting cookies. 

I am running Microsoft Edge version 41.16299.15.0 on Windows 10 x64 Build 16299.64. Edge flickers on certain webpages (namely diep.io), but runs fine on all others. Note that it is only Edge that flashes, i.e. the taskbar doesn't. I have tried the following to no avail: 

Possible solution: Start menu > Settings > System > Multitasking > Virtual Desktops Play around with the settings and see what you prefer. 

Go to: Desktop > Right Click > NVIDIA Control Panel > Manage 3D Settings > Global Settings > Set preferred graphcis processor to High-performance NVIDIA processor. Note that it may be named differently due to my PC having the GeForce 820M not GTX 1050, but the default settings should all be in that control panel. 

When viewing the history on Chrome, it does not typically get recorded. Unless the other user is a computer forensics expert, he/she will not be able to see you viewed the history, nor will they know if you delete something from the history. Note I am using Chrome version 60.0.3112.101. 

Does anyone know how to fix this? (Was a pain typing this, makes me understand just how much I use the e key) Edit: I tested the keyboard with a Linux live CD. First time I booted, the keys will not registrar in a notepad app unless I repetitively press them around 20 times. I rebooted into Linux again, this time the keyboard worked OK, but missed keystrokes occasionally. In both situations it was the same keys as described above that were malfunctioning. After rebooting into Windows, the keyboard functioned like the 2nd situation above (occasional missed strokes) for around 5min. Then no amount of pressing on the malfunctioning keys could make it register. 

How does Compiz automatically decide which windows should be sticky (i.e. should be visible on all workspaces)? Windows such as gnome-panel and cairo-dock always stay on the visible workspace, without requiring additional configuration. How does Compiz figure this out? Thanks! 

Assuming you are asking about symlinking executables in general, this should automatically work out of the box. Make sure /usr/bin/nodejs is executable by everybody, and restart the terminal. In any case, calling directly from anywhere in a terminal should work normally. If appears to execute properly but NodeJs itself does not like being called as instead of , that's a different problem. 

I know that each program that can open files has a desktop entry under , and that the defaults for each mimetype are stored in and . On my system, the command that updates these lists is . However, I could not find an answer on google about how this program decides which application becomes default if there are multiple installed that can handle that file. I ask because when I installed Geany on my system recently, all source code files started opening in Geany, instead of in my regular text editor, and I was wondering how the choice to replace my regular editor with Geany was made. Also, I know that I can change each file back to my regular editor manually, but is there a way give a certain program default to all the types of files it can open? Essentially like Windows's default applications manager, where you can see all the filetypes any program can open, and select or deselect them all. I also know of the utility, but I that doesn't seem to be what chooses between multiple possible programs for opening a file, or for re-registering as default all the filetypes for a certain program. 

The is an argument to . You should run the command . You can run to get more help about the different arguments to . 

to start CompizConfig Settings Manager works and CCSM works beautifully. When I attempt to start Compiz itself, however, I get this: 

I decided that I would like Compiz 0.9 on my computer, which runs Ubuntu 10.10. I followed the instructions on this Compiz wiki page; some lines I changed. I now have compiled and installed Compiz core, libcompizconfig, compizconfig-python, ccsm, plugin pack 'main', and plugin pack 'extra'. Running the command in bash: 

I have set up a FTP server on my laptop using IIS manager. I can access it by typing ftp://192.168.1.xxx (my laptop's internal IP), but only on the laptop I have set up the server. I have set up port forwarding on my router (External port: 20-20, Internal port: 21-21, protocol: TCP), however, the warning: "Note: Access to the modem FTP Server via FTP port change to 2121 on the WAN. On the LAN is still on port 21." appears. The site is inaccessible on any other device that is on the same network. Below is the screenshot of the port forwarding options: $URL$ 

A possible reason for this problem is the list from which the BIOS chooses the boot device was altered, so it may be booting from something other than your hard drive. A possible solution is to remove all connected USB devices and reboot. If this does not work, shut down the computer, press and HOLD F2 and power on. In the BIOS, you can change the boot order manually. Finally, if the first option is your hard drive or Windows Boot Manager, but you still can't boot, your hard drive might be corrupt.

I figured it out. I used GDB to trace the message being outputted - it turns out that Compiz expects a CLI argument "--display" and a value for (in this case, $DISPLAY or ":0"), which I wasn't providing. However, other problems prevented me from using Compiz, so I am removing it. I am currently in the process of getting Compiz 0.9.2 through the Unity PPA on my Ubuntu system; if that doesn't work, I'll downgrade back to 0.8.x. 

I know that installing a package through APT (apt-get or aptitude for my computer) will automatically install the appropriate man pages and update the man database. When I want to build the same packages, however, no man page is installed and I cannot use man for that program. How do I get the man pages for software I have compiled? (I am running Ubuntu 10.10). 

Now that VirtualBox 4 has been released, the entirety of VirtualBox is licensed under the GNU GPL. All the closed-source features in the older versions still exist, in the form of downloadable Extension Packs. These extension packs are licensed under the PUEL license. 

I have noticed that those strange symbols at the end change every time I try to run Compiz. The value of the environment variable DISPLAY is :0. Any ideas on why this may be happening? Thanks! (I'm not sure if this question is in the right place) 

I too was having the same problem. All I can recommend is to make sure you are running the latest beta, and upgrade the graphics drivers. Also try clearing your cookies and your cache. Beyond that, all that can be said is that it is a beta product and not likely to work correctly. You should, of course, send feedback using thefeedback button on the right side of the window. 

For additional reference, here is a nice website that fairly good list of commands available for cmd.exe: $URL$ 

I have noticed that the window menu for most windows look like standard menus, while the window menu for the command processor (cmd.exe) look different. I assumed that cmd.exe was providing custom-made menus, until I started seeing the same type of menu in Chrome. Here are two images: Standard Menu Different Menu Here are two more images: Standard Menu in Chrome Different Menu in Chrome Right clicking anywhere on a webpage opened in Chrome brings up a menu similar to the "different menu". What causes these two styles of windows? I am running Windows Vista 32-bit. Thanks! By The Way: I also have a Windows 7 64-bit computer. On that computer, cmd.exe's window menu is the "Standard" one, not "Different". It seems Microsoft must have fixed it. I haven't seen how the Chrome menu looks on Win7 64-bit yet. Edit: I have now figured out what the problem was. The problem was the way the menu items were being added and removed. I found when I disabled AdBlock: Chrome's menus went back to the "Standard" style. So I am asking now, more specifically, what causes this change? What legacy or backwards-compatible code causes this to happen? (I will put it in a new question on StackOverflow if need be.)
