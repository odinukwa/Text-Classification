You achieve more granuality with DSCP compared to CoS as you can set more options because of the difference in bit size since CoS uses only 3 bits to set markings while DSCP uses 6 bits. All in all, I would advise you seperate your ISCSI network from your core infrastrucure and then you wouldn't even need to worry about QoS. 

Setting the switch to use MTU of 9k globally will not be an issue for host device interfaces that are programmed to use 1500 as a maximum. The host will compile frames that have an MTU size of 1500 maximum and while the switch accepts a maximum of 9000, there will be no fragmentation and it will accept the frames without discarding them. An issue would only arrise if you were to do it the other way round. Passing 9K frames on a switch accepting only a maximum of 1500 Bytes. Just make sure that any 9K frames are passed along switches that support 9K frames. Normally your ISCSI network would remain isolated from the rest of the network and routing would not be enabled due to latency concerns. 

I think what you are trying to do is choose which port on the two switches to be in a blocking state. If you have two switches and they are connected to each other with two Ethernet cables, assuming the port speed are the same, which equals same cost, spanning tree will choose which path is fastest to the root bridge, by looking at the port priority and port id. Because the BPDU's coming from the root bridge/Upstream switch that count, you need to adjust the port priority to a lower value on the root bridge side, so that the adjacent switch port will receive a lower port priority BPDU compared to the second Ethernet link, causing this to be the preferred path back to the root bridge. Which in turn would set the second port to be in a blocking state, amber LED. To view port priority numbers, use the show spanning-tree command on a Cisco switch. You should see a list of ports and Prio.Nbr something like 128.24. To change the port priority, you can use the following: 

Normally the DB9 serial end goes to a switch and then another serial connector to your laptop. If your laptop doesn't have a serial connector, you need to use something like a USB-Serial adapter where it will have a male DB9 connection that will link with the cable connected to your switch. 

Also, looking quickly at the link to Gefen product you have provided, it states that jumbo frames of 8K need to be enabled. Just in case this is something that is also causing an issue for you. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

The priority values are 0, 32, 64, 96, 128, 160, 192, and 224. All other values are rejected. I hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

There is no need to assign a broadcast or network address to a host. When you have assigned an address to a host, based on the subnetmask, the host will calculate based on the mask what to use for network and broadcast. On Linux hosts you can already add the network and broadcast address in the interface file but I have no idea what the point of it is. 

If you are not using any Network Management Systems that can support things like Policies or using 802.1x with a NAC, I think you are only going to be able to use port security and lock it by source MAC. So basically what you want to do is, tell the switch that on Port X, only devices with a MAC source of X is allowed to use the port. Configures a single authorized source MAC addre ss for a port that belongs to a specified VLAN. 

If you have the HP2920's stacked together and they are being seen as one switch fabric, you can plug an Ethernet cable to each switch from each server and use LACP trunks to setup link aggregation. I understand that when you did this last time your network went down but this will more than likely be to the fact that you did not setup an LACP trunk on your switch. You will need to make sure you configure this on the switches before connecting them to the servers. If you had LACP configured on the server but not the switches, that the sort of behaviour I would expect to see. You can start of with just one link plugged in for continuation of service and add the other once all is configured. Just be aware that there will be a brief outage while the links are aggregated. This should only be a few seconds. To configure the trunk on a procurve switch, use the following command: 

I would look which VTY line is used for FTP and make sure appropiate permissions have been configured. But also do not forget that you can copy from the ERX to a host that runs a FTP server so this might give you better access as the ssh/telnet account you are using might have higher priviledges and you have greater control of the FTP server not being on the ERX. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

You have pretty much two options. 1) Buy used equipment from Ebay which are dirt cheap. You won't get the latest and the greatest but if you are starting up, this is ideal. Do research on which equipment is best to start your lab. Many people have done great write ups on this. Just google for information. 2) Cheapest option is to use simulators such as PacketTracer and GNS3. GNS3 gives you alot more options as it isn't locked down to a single vendor where as Packet Tracer is specific to Cisco equipment. With GNS3 you can use Cisco, JunOS, ComWare and ExtremeNetworks just to name a few. GNS3 website and forum is a great start to learn more about it. Apologies if my answer isn't too in-depth but this section of the site isn't really for questions like yours. This site is more dedicated for enterprise technical questions and not for learning, home setups, etc etc. Wish you all the best in your pursuit. SleepyMan 

The area design you have specified will not work. The interface and its adjacent interface need to be in the same area. You can't have one interface in area0 and the adjacent router interface in area1. One of the conditions to create a successful relationship with a neighbour is that the area id must match, which it would never do in your design. See the picture below which might help you understand it better. 

There is alot more to do but this hopefully gives you a high level run down. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

So using these details, when your Windows PC wants to send data, it will look at the destination IP address, then resolve this IP address to a MAC address so that it can use layer 2 to send the frame to the destination MAC address. If it does not know the MAC address, it will issue an ARP which is a broadcast, asking "Who has IP address 192.168.1.1", and wait for a response. It should only receive one response and if there are two, you know you have more than one device with the same IP address. If we are talking about NAT, then you can join two networks that are using the same private IP schemes but when you are connecting to the second network, passing through NAT, your IP address will be changed to the external address so you are no longer using the private IP address of the first network. The IP address will get translated to an IP address that can work on the second network and not cause any conflicts. The translated address for example could be reserved to still use an IP address in the private range, but the configuration will make sure that you are not using an address that is already used on the second network and has been added to the NAT pool of addresses. Hope this helps. SleepyMan 

This switch seems to be built to connect HP's proliant servers. The throughput is also far less than the standard 1810. You should perhaps looks at the HP 1820-8G which is the successor I believe. You should still be able to get that one. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

You would definately see a benefit. You are sharing the 1Gbit link to your server with several clients so your bottleneck would be a the 1Gbit link to your server. Once you have 10Gbit connected, that pipe to your server has increased and you can server those clients much better concurrently. So imagine two clients downloading files from the shared server at the same time, they would in turn share that 1Gbit uplink to the server which means that both clients would never utilize the full 1Gbit connection as they need to share the 1Gbit uplink. Once you have 10Gbit installed, you will end up with a far greater pipe to accommodate those clients. Just be careful in regards to other hardware on your server. For example the type of disks you are using could then become the bottleneck if the read/write I/O of the disks isn't sufficient to provide multiple concurrent connections and still expecting everyone to utilize their full 1Gbit connection. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

Give this a go and see if that works. It's worth checking the status of the VLAN interface and make sure it isn't down. I got this from the configuration guide here on page 112. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

If you are using NAT and are on this version of IOS, it would be adviseable for you to do an upgrade of the firmware. 

When you perform name resolution on the router, you will get the correct IP address that you have added in the previous steps. Just make sure your other clients use the routers IP address to use the DNS service on the router itself. DHCP POOL WITH RESERVATIONS To answer your DHCP server question. You can use the client identifier to reserve by MAC address. 

will change the switch's priority, just low enough, without becoming the root bridge, in turn making it the root bridge, should the primary root bridge fail. Please also keep in mind that all the effects described are dependent on using the default values. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

Referring to that tutorial, the external IP address (routable) would be the 222.222.222.x range address. Anything within 192.168.x.x will be a private range which can only be used internally as per RFC1918 hence why you would use NAT. Hope this helps you on your quest. SleepyMan 

You are getting the 550 Cannot create file "files to get" or permission problem which clearly indicates that the account you are using to connect does not have the sufficient permission. Looking at the screenshot, on the right panel you can see the permissions set for both directories. The outgoing directory, you have no permission to write to, this includes the owner, group and other accounts. Normally on UNIX systems, the outgoing is for read only and incoming is used to write files to the FTP server. You can't see the other files most likely that you are not allowed to list the files, again, a permission problem. I would investigate if there is another, perhaps a special account that allows you to view all the files. It could also be that this is done by design to protect the system from unintentionally corruption.
