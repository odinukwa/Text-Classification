I have a Windows 8.1 Pro system with C:\ only containing the OS and some software. I also have a drive F:\ where I keep all of my files. Today I did a reset of Windows to get back to a clean slate. One of the folders on F:\ is my Dropbox folder, so I've been going through help articles to make sure to simply point Dropbox to F:\Dropbox and letting it index those files in place, instead of redownloading ~300 GB. One user described a problem where, because the Owner of the files was left over from his previous Windows installation, Dropbox began making conflicted duplicates of everything. This led me to go check out who the Owner is on some of my files. Permissions, Ownership, UAC and ACLs have never been my strongsuit. Frankly, I don't know if my account was the Owner of all my files in the old system, and, if not, why not. I don't understand much about what determines who owns a file when it is created, downloaded, copied, whatever. Now that I'm looking at the Owner of a few of these files, I'm noticing a trend that most of the ones I've looked at are owned by an entity with a long string name that means nothing to me. S-1-5-21-blahblahblah. The blahs stand in place of a long set of numbers. My best guess is that this string somehow was used in place of any file my user was the Owner of in my previous installation. Should I be taking ownership of all of these? Is there any harm in simply taking ownership of the entire Dropbox folder and its contents before I set up syncing? 

In Windows (7 or 8, in my case), snapping a Chrome window to the left or right half of the screen (by using Win + → or Win + ← or by dragging to the corresponding edges) results in the window taking up slightly more than half the screen. On the screen I'm using now (900px wide), it results in about 60 extra pixels (almost 7%). I've long found this supremely annoying because it often prevents properly using two windows snapped side by side, which is what the snapping feature is designed for. I'm wondering if it's known why this happens, and if there's some way to correct it (perhaps a flag or extension?). Update: It appears this only happens with a window having many tabs. The higher the tab count gets after first creating the problem, the worse the problem becomes (until it reaches a maximum). See the below screenshots. One might conclude the solution is to avoid having many tabs, but that is a lame solution. Is there no way to prevent this behavior for those that find it undesirable? Normal behavior: 

I was able to solve my issue with a utility called Kernel OST Viewer. It was able to open my corrupted OST and browse the messages that got lost in the transfer. For my needs, this was good enough, but if I had absolutely needed those messages to be transferred from the damaged profile to my Gmail account, they have a paid version of the utility that can do that, and a number of other export methods. 

My problem, other than the continued crashing, is that I dragged the messages from the Exchange account, and so they no longer appear there, but only a small fraction of them made it into the Gmail account before the crashes started happening. Now it seems maybe they're in some sort of limbo where Outlook wants to sync them over to Gmail, but since it crashes so quickly after launch (while syncing), it is unable to do so. I'm wondering if there's any approach I can take that will call these messages back from limbo instead of just considering them lost. In , I can still see the and for the Exchange account, as well as the for the Gmail account. There are files in the RoamCache that begin with . Should I try backing up some assortment of all these files, and removing/reconnecting my IMAP Gmail connector? UPDATE I have gotten Outlook to stop crashing by setting up a new profile. However, the messages that were in the middle of transferring do not appear in either account, neither on the server (i.e. Outlook 365 web client/Gmail web client), nor in the Outlook desktop client. I'm assuming they're trapped somewhere in a data file on my machine and I'm wondering if there's any way to get the new profile to see that there are still a few hundred messages that should be uploaded to the IMAP/Gmail account. 

Just copy and paste the code in a new text file and save it as (or whatever as long as you keep the extension). 

The generic hardware IDs actually is . In fact, apparently there are only generic drivers available for such cards. The installed driver version was 8.15.10.1749, which dates back to 2009, and probably was the one bundled with Windows 7. The latest version available from Intel official support page is 8.15.10.2869, released about three years later. On a side note, looking for an updated version through Windows Update can be misleading: the system will happily assume the driver is "up to date" even when no entry was found in Microsoft database.

TL;DR RAM "optimizers" (or cleaners/boosters/whatever) are junk and should be avoided, no matter what. So yes, remove such useless program(s). The proper way When you're running out of memory you either: 

Additionally, a Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser scheduled task will be created. QueryAppBlock.exe It's a command-line utility with no user interface. It was first included with the Windows Vista Upgrade Advisor tool, and has since been bundled with newer versions designed for Windows 7 and later. Its purpose is to scans your hardware, devices, and installed programs for known compatibility issues with a newer Windows version by comparing them against a specific database. A report is created afterwards. 

Using Phoenix EDID designer you can extract the EDID stored in the registry, and change the settings to reflect the monitor true capabilities. When done you save the modified EDID data, and open it using Monitor Asset Manager to validate it. Then you create an INF file, and update the monitor driver in the Device Manager using the file you just created. A restart is required to apply the changes. Further reading 

Adding or removing pinned items programmatically is not officially supported, and the registry data is in binary format anyway, hence not easily editable. The actual shortcut files are stored in this hidden folder:

This can be confirmed by inspecting the actual driver package. In fact, the installation file contains the following line: 

Updating the drivers Laptop graphics adapters usually require specific, customized drivers in order to work. Those you can download from the official AMD website are generic drivers, and aren't compatible. All drivers can be found in the official Dell support page. As for the graphic card (i.e. AMD Radeon HD 7730M), latest driver version is 8.951.9.1000 right now. You can find it under the Video category. 

Note As you're deleting files and folders, you might want to replace the command with first. This way you can ensure anything that shouldn't be deleted actually would. Multiple patterns In order to delete multiple folders matching different patterns the syntax is not too different. As @dbenham correctly pointed out, a one-line command is enough. You can also specify different paths:

Recently I began transferring old messages from a work (Exchange) account to Gmail using the IMAP connector in Outlook. It had been going fine for a few days as I organized and then moved folders. Then, when I tried to drag over a large number of messages from the Inbox, I ran into this known Outlook bug, even though it had been working fine, previously. The updates to Outlook that are said to fix this problem have not worked for me. The crash message is as follows: 

Almost 2 years ago I built a custom desktop. This week it seems to be becoming inoperable. It's a dual boot system capable of booting to Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. When I sat down at it the other night, I noticed Windows (8.1) complaining about broken links in my shortcuts. I soon discovered my F: drive (the main data drive) did not appear in "This PC." I thought maybe the drive failed, but I had some pending updates, so I rebooted. Rebooting took abnormally longer to happen. Programs that I personally set to launch at startup in the system tray never launched. I opened a File Explorer windows to view This PC and all the drives appeared, but the green progress bar indicating the loading of all the drives' info took many minutes to finish. The F: drive did appear, but the blue bar indicating how full it was never did. Interacting with the window put it into a (Not Responding) state. I wasn't able to open any files. Wondering if this was related to recent software changes, I powered down and booted into my Windows 7 drive instead. It got to the screen that allows me to select Windows 7 or 8, but once I selected 7, the screens went black and stayed that way. I was forced to do a hard shutdown. I tried Windows 8 one more time but had the same problems. So I shut it down and left it shutdown since. If my F: drive were the problem, I wouldn't think the OSes (each are on their own separate drives) would have such trouble. My question is, what parts should I suspect of failing? How can I diagnose this? My best guess is that a drive bus on the MoBo could be bad, causing some of the drives to have trouble communicating. I've never had such catastrophic failure before other than what was obviously HDD related. Could a bad RAM stick cause this? Could the CPU be failing? I can get specific part model identifiers if needed. I have a Gigabyte motherboard, an Intel i7 (one of the Haswell models) and four hard drives. There are 32 GB of that "Hyper Red" memory that Kingston makes. Each OS is on its own SSD drive made by Samsung in the neighborhood of 320 GB. The other two drives (F: and G:) are 3 TB SATA disks. One is my primary data drive and the other is its backup (I also use other backup methods). There are 32 GB of that "Hyper Red" memory that Kingston makes. I have a pretty decent NVIDIA graphics card made by PCN I believe. Corsair powersupply. Blu-Ray burner. 

I started a new job recently. My computer at the office has Office 2010 installed. However, I've also installed my personal license of Office 365, giving me "access" (har har) to the 2013 versions of the programs. I've done this on previous work computers because I strongly prefer OneNote and Excel 2013 to the previous versions. Anyway, Outlook 2010 has a "OneNote" button in the "Move" category of the Home tab. Clicking it, however, attempts to send a note to OneNote 2010 (which hasn't been set up). I'm trying to figure out how to modify this button, or add a new button altogether, that would instead trigger a note to be created in OneNote 2013. In short, how do you add a "Move to OneNote 2013" button in Outlook 2010?
