Set up your table on a new sheet. Create column headers , , , etc. Under header (in ), type the following. 

The function makes the look in the column 4 columns to the right of the first column of . This formula should return your lookup value (i.e., the value of ) if it's found and an error if it is not. From what I can tell, this is what you wanted. If it's not, please leave a comment and let me know what you want. 

This code can be run from the Macros menu in Excel. It simply reverts the font color of highlighted cells back to their original colors and then deletes the change log if the user OKs it. 

Instead of using worksheet functions, you might want to consider using a pivot table. Pivot tables are more flexible and easier to set up and maintain. So, with raw data on Sheet1 as shown below, select all your raw data and click on the tab. 

Your request is pretty vague, so here's a pretty vague answer that will hopefully get you on the right track. In each cell C1, D1, and E1, your formula will have to include some check for the value in A1. You can use the following formula construction and fill in the specifics for your project (i.e., replace the parts of the formula in ). 

You could try wrapping your text-trimming formula in to convert the string result to a number. For example: 

This counts only instances where one value in the column is 0 (and not blank) and the following value is 1. 

Now your pivot table is set up. You can now filter by owner above the pivot table. Set the filter to show only values for Bob. Right-click inside the pivot table and choose . In the options menu, set the table to show 0 for empty cells. Finally, you can create a pivot chart line graph for this table. Click on the pivot table and choose from the > ribbon. Choose the line graph style you want and you've got it. 

Press Shift+Enter. This will extend the selection to the cell you specified. Press Ctrl+D to fill the formula throughout the selected range. 

The last number (0.01) is the threshold deviation for highlighting a cell. Set this to whatever you like. Finally, set how you'd like the cells to be formatted. 

Once you have these strings, by either method, you'll have to get clever with string manipulation functions, e.g., , , and , to extract the values you want. Since doing this would be both a waste of your time and mine, I'll refrain from doing this here. 

This formula uses the function to define which part of the lookup table to use for your based on the Product ID. The column number for the is attained by using a function to find the appropriate location. 

Enter the formula as an array formula by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Enter. Fill the formula down your table. Then you can update your pivot source range and add to your Values. 

Of course, this is tedious as it requires you to manually recreate the format of each cell. If you're going to be using this a lot with lots of varied formats, I would say this is a perfect opportunity to use a VBA function to do the heavy lifting. You can paste the following code into a module in the VBA Editor (opened by pressing Alt+F11). 

Select the value cells in your table, i.e., in your example. Press F5. Click . Select and click OK. This will select all the blank cells in the table. Click inside the formula bar and paste or type the formula below (Do NOT hit Enter): 

If you are trying to concatenate the value with something else (based on your comment above), you can use the function to specify a number format for the decimal in your formula. For example, if you have a decimal in and in , you can specify 6 decimal places with the following: 

If you want to find whether any of the three words appear in the column of data, you can use the following formula, where is the column of data: 

I would advise against sorting tables that include formulas, especially with references to other cells within the same table. Unless your data is dynamic (i.e., it absolutely must retain all formulas), I would copy the table and paste the values only (using Paste Special) back onto the table. If you must retain the formulas but need to do several ad hoc sorts, I would suggest creating a second values-only working copy of the table to sort on a separate sheet. 

I'm assuming each record will have an and any comma after the email will indicate a new record. This is just trading one assumption for another, but it worked in my test. 

The value of must be set by a formula in . A formula only (directly) determines the value of the cell that contains it. 

Calculate once, copy the range of formulas, then Paste Special (right-click target, then S) the Values only back into the range. This replaces the formulas with their results and will prevent the random passwords from being recalculated. 

This works on the idea that the only time you don't want to augment the number is when the count is the same as the previous record and the number above isn't already listed the appropriate number of times. (The appropriate number of times is equal to .) This second condition is necessary because of cases like rows 10 through 13 in the example, where groups of the same size follow each other in the table. 

Add a field to your data that checks for uniqueness of First and Last Name combinations. In my sample data, First Names are in column , Last Names in . Fill the following formula down the column in your new field. 

Filling this formula one cell to the right () will give you the average of . The key to this formula is that you anchor it to a fixed point of reference, in this example. In , the indirect reference will not be offset at all. The indirect reference will be offset by the same number of cells (up/down and left/right) you are offset from . 

After choosing a location for your pivot table (mine is at on the same sheet in this sample, but you may find it better to have it on a separate sheet), just drag and drop the fields from the Pivot Table Field List into the appropriate categories: will go under Row Values and will go under Values. Since is the default setting for pivot table values, this is all you need to do. 

You can set up a conditional formatting rule for to highlight unexpected values. Select and (in Excel 2007) go to Conditional Formatting >> New Rule >> 'Use a formula to determine which cells to format'. Enter the following formula as the rule here: 

Note: You will have to add a reference to use the regular expression syntax in the function. In the VBA editor, go to 'Tools' >> 'References...', then check the box next to 'Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5'. 

Here's one of the complicated solutions. It's probably best just to paste this in and hope for the best rather than trying to sit down and parse this. 

Unique entries will return the value . Simply filter your table for records with the value in the new field. Sample: Insert new field:
