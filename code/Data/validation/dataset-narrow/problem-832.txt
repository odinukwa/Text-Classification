If you want to add more name servers just add more NS records. They will be served up in a round robin fashion by default. Unless you have lots of traffic two or three name servers should be sufficient. Most requests will be served from cache if you have much traffic. If you have the kind of traffic that Google, Amazon, or Facebook have you should have technical staff who know how to optimize DNS for fast server access. 

Recent versions of can automatically generate empty zoned for private address spaces. Other configuration have configuration files for empty zones, and you may have to edit it to allow the above zone to work. 

The nodes do not send data to the master. The master pulls data from the client. You need to add the node to the , and restart the master. The master will then pull data from the node. Normally, the master will be one of the nodes that is monitored. You can telnet to port 4949 on the node from the master to test. The protocol is text based. I documented my experience Monitoring with Munin. 

You may want to look at the Shorewall setup guide. In your case you can ignore the NAT information. If you have a different IP for your upstream connection, then you have a simple two interface setup. If not, then you need to look at a bridging configuration. 

On most of the networks I work with the router address is the first routable address (1, 129, and 193) in the subnet. This is by tradition, and not a requirement. Another option is to use the highest routeable address (126, 190, and 254) for the router. The lowest address in the each subnet (0, 128, and 192) is the network address and is not assigned. The highest address in each subnet (127, 191, and 255) is the broadcast address and should be received by all computers in the subnet. To allow for these three addresses, the smallest subnet has four addresses, allowing for one computer in the subnet. I see a few problems with the diagram: 

Add a line to /etc/fstab. This will mount the file system at startup, The header will show you which column to place the various option. Use and man fstab for additional information. 

The owner of the directory should be the effective userid of the web servers. Try changing the ownership, then you can set the permissions to 700, 750, or 755. chown www-data temp_images 

You will need to construct and test the appropriate regexp ACLs for the extra levels. (I would get the ACL for your organization working first and work from there. I find the Zytrax documenation helps a lot. 

It appears dovecot is finding the mail directory location. However it needs to know which type of delivery to use. Your maildir entries should be prefixed with either , or another supported type. I prefer . Alternatively add back the mailbox location: 

EDIT2: I use an ACL in Exim to reject the Mail From command if a local domain is used in the address. This applies if the connecting host is not one I consider local. Local hostss include servers on the local network, approved relays, and hosts using an authenticated connection on the submission port (587). 

Scheduled or delayed actions are not something I expect from a database server. Actions like you want are generally programmed as an external service. Scheduling can be done using a variety of mechanisms. Crontab is one. For a Java application, Quartz is one option. If you are querying the table to determine if someone is logged in, I would consider using a view including the relative time limit in the selection criteria. Date arithmetic is common database functionality. This would make cleaning up the table less time critical. Oracle has a Jobs facility that is basically a crontab service provided by the database server. I don't know of any other databases with similar functionality. 

Exim will not run as . The default non-root userid it uses is hard-coded as part of the build. In your case it is appears to be . Add a user id with the group and it should run. EDIT: Missed the scroll bar on the log. Exim appears to be selecting the correct router and DNS lookup succeeded. However, there is no indication that a connection is being established with the remote server. Try using telnet to one or more of the IPs to see if you can connect to the SMTP port. The command 

This behavior is common if you have a memory leak in a plugin. This results in memory starvation, and the server threads start paging in and out of memory. It can also happen if you allow too many threads as Apache will spawn new threads as load goes up. There are a number of settings that can be used to work around the issue. 

Hard drive access is the slowest option you have. Better to use ram when available. MySQL will manage its cache appropriately. It you are concerned with limiting the RAM used by MySQL tune its memory parameters. If you give it too little memory performance will suffer. You don't state your O/S platform but Linux and other Unix anything read from disk gets stored in memory buffers. These buffers are kept until memory is needed for another purpose. Depending on memory available you may gain no benefit from closing the database and reopening it. 

The redirection will again block buffer data before writing it to disk. Much of this will use memory recorded as buffers. Modern file systems may keep several seconds worth of data in memory, before flushing the data to disk. 

iptables will list all your rules with packet counts. These can be valuable in determining if you are hitting particular rules. Given you have 200 or 300 rules, it would be a good idea to look at a tool to build and configure your firewall. I like Shorewall which has some good show functionality to list important data about the running firewall. Some of the features I like include: 

The timetable I use for scaling down TTL is to reduce it by half whenever the time until the change is twice the current TTL. Keep the TTL at least five or ten minutes. Add the new addresses to the active nameservers 10 to 20 minutes in advance of the change. Remove the old entries after the change has been accomplished. 

If you are running SSL for only one domain this should be no problem. Configure a virtual server on port 443 with the SSL certificate. Configure virtual servers on port 80 for all the domains. You may want the HTTP service for the SSL domain to automatically forward to HTTPS. If you configure all the domains on both HTTP and HTTPS, you may want to redirect HTTPS connection on the non SSL domains to redirect to HTTP. The Apache rewrite documentation should cover the rewrite rules required. I don't know the capabilities of CPANEL but either option should work. Comments by others indicate you may have to manually edit the Apache configuration for the first option. 

There are various options included in the apache2 mass virtual host documentation. In your case a solution may work for you. 

It looks like you may be missing entries in the tree to the policy entry. You will need to load the overlay. The man page for the module specifies what you need to setup. I find the Ztrax documentation useful as well. 

Localhost always refers to the system you are on. If your Apache server is restricted to localhost, you will not be able to access it from any other host without a tunnel. You can use to open a tunnel if you have enabled the openssh server. Normally, you would browse to your Linux systems external address. Depending on your router (DHCP/DNS servers) you may be able to browse by name. Otherwise browse to the IP address of the server. If you open up a terminal session on the Linux server, the command should list your IP addresses. The one you want likely starts 

If local_domains or relay_to_domains contain a wildcard ('*'), you may be an open relay. To answer your specific questions: 

If your email server is set up correctly, there should be little if any penalty. I have only had to manualy whitelist incorrectly configured severs. 

The basic password authentication will do what you want. However, the authentication tokens pass in clear text on an http connection. You probably should require https for remote connections. This is also available. Using an ssh tunnel will also do what you want. You may find that port 80 is blocked if you are outside your ISPs network. I generally configure access without a password from the LAN and add security as required outside the LAN.
