execute it with If your FileToBeSourced.sh script is with one line commands it should work. Far far away to be ready to be used in a production environment. Test it and eventually use it at your own risk. It skips lines that start with because they should cause the error . 

Remember that you can always make restart the login manager with commands like , or and after , but this will close the whole and not only your current session. Instead to run from remote a graphic application it is enough to connect with to enable the X11 forwarding, or , and run the command. 

The option will list only the directories. The is the 1st parameter you pass to the script. By the way do not parse the output of command as tree or to avoid problem related withe space tab and newline that are characters allowed inside a name of a file or of a directory. In the latter case you can use . Ask in a shell or search e.g. on this site about it. 

The program is frozen, and you can write other commands in the shell. To give it again life you can use if the number of the job was 1, or with 

Under Linux with bash, or under Windows with cygwin or with the native bash shell running on windows, you can use the bash expansion. For example writing your shell will expand it in 

You can imagine similar situation with , it will execute the last command starting with recorded in the history, but if the last that you remember was starting with a space... now you know you will use another. Last note: less is dramatic your error more it can be devious because it can pass without that you notice... and you will risk to be called to pay all the interests of a bill that you cannot remember. 

What does it means You can see the command as a more fancy and friendly version of that is "a tool to install, build, remove and manage Debian packages". The package are installed through , that calls all the scripts needed by the packgage. Those scripts may act in different ways and can have returned different exit status. The error you receive said 

Of course you can repeat it with dog instead of cat too :-) Check before with and remove after with . Notes: You have to remember to enable globstar () on each new shell in which you want to use that syntax else you can put it in your file... 

On Internet your browser usually executes code without that you even notice. If you browse as a not privileged user the code will run with your privileges (it can do what your user can do). If you run your browser as root each code will run as root! (And each code can do whatever it wants, not limited to only one user but to all the system). This can apply even to problems related to the normal behaviour of the browser: crashes, user errors... 

Send the last email sent from the distribution list, directly only to that user from the distribution list email account, with the same sending modalities used the first time (maybe you sent the list to yourself and in cc or bcc to the users). 

I agree with your decision to switch to gnuplot. It can accomplish a wider range of actions. With the info you provided I can just try to guess that or the png drivers are missing or some variable is not correctly set. Notes: 

Of course you can do a little script to loop over each file and do an scp compressed transfer, even without the use of tar. All is more cosy with rsync 

It depends It depends from the mail, the image, how is updated your program/system, how it is vulnerable (and this it will be maybe known only later...). A standard procedure should be: 

Thanks to G-Man it is tested that in powershell it works, meanwhile in cmd.exe the above command will copy each match up to five characters and with all the extension that start with . 

I assume that you want to create for the file new converted file with the same basename but different extension. Try something like 

That means that, in my limited experience, you should look in your file and modify it or use what will you find doing, for example, 

... of course if they felt the need to do a powershell it is reasonable to expect that in that environment there should be a more simple way to do it... but maybe the following one is an enough simple starting point for your script: 

Referring to the article you cited, over there it is reported in a proper way, because the algorithm used in this case is the zip one. When a programmer creates a tool that do something it is not uncommon that he tries to choose a name that will remember the action easier. So they firstly used , ... When that name is yet used they invent other as , (that means Archived by Robert Jung), ... The confusion arises because with the same term you have a specific program and an action performed from that command: ideed in Unix it exists a command to find the files. This confusion can be increased some times after if the command becomes obsolete but not the term chosen for it... 

As noticed from the OP this conversion from a vectorial can be lossless. The introduction of the option will give a resolution maybe acceptable for our purpose that we will pay with an increased size of the file. It can be increased e.g.to 600 DPI or more if needed. If the file contains slides (e.g. from a powerpoint), included as images inside the PDF file it's possible to extract these with and include them in a new pdf file. 

So in a pipe process the current version of bash (GNU bash, version 4.3.11) calls another subshell. You can read more on the Bash Guide for Beginners [1],[2] . Do not let the title mislead you... it's full of good information not only for the beginners. 

"Do " Now you can do , the trap here is that you need to press : and q to exit ! Application folder and When you create an application folder, e.g. , the below line will only check if it is in the : 

The program writes a temporary file meanwhile it works. It puts this file in the same directory where the zip file has to be created. Then it will rename it with the final name. From you can specify the path: 

You can also record clips from VLC by pressing the red Record button in the player itself; this is a conversion with all that it concerns. When you write the link in the open network stream there is the possibility to play Alt+P, to stream Alt+S or to convert Alt+0. Chosing the streaming (stream to a file) or conversion case meanwhile you can see it too. Probably if you choose the same encoding for video, audio you can have a not lossy output. The shortcut from keyboard can be different for language different from English or in different version of Vlc. 

Other programs/ ways Using is not secure. The secure version of ftp is named , ftp secure. Try to use it instead of , if you can. It's always a good exercise to do your own scripts, but it is better to use the tools created for that purpose when they exist. As alternatives more cosy you can use (see below) that will not require any other server installed remotely. Since you have access to the remote computer if it is installed you can use too. If it misses try to use , or taking advantage from the ssh-key[4]. If you want to stick with , use the option that will blindly copy all the files from the directory, but set in advance the mode of file transfer to binary with the command. 

Try to change the runlevel at boot time, and to start with runlevel 1. Then you will be root and you can edit each file. 

Even if it is possible to read from a file and compose the command you want in a cycle there is a command you may find more cosy: . If the filename are all without spaces you can use this simple syntax to create the command you want then redirect () this output to a shell () that will execute it. With you take the 1st column, with the second and so on... 

It is not completely clear for me if you want to log to that server from a different computer, and where is the script that you want to execute. However it is, you can execute a script via . Let we see it in 2 steps. Step 1: Start by command line. If it is a local script you can do something similar to 

From the same article of the steps below [1], it is possible to arrive to a second site [2], where Waldo gives a power shell script for a one click solution. References
