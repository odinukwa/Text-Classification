Only that this does not write out the gateway as "gateway" but as "nexthop" and I don't see the DNS entry in there... this is not a workable solution for anything as I see, but this is the most I could get out of netsh with dump/restore. 

I wanted to take this route but find it to lucrative to do these every single time I want to open a note. So any suggestions to solve this would be welcome, things that I think would be good solutions: 

The list of network adapters that can ordered in the window's menu, in was configured but that seems to be not enough! I figured it out by pinging myself that returned an ipv6 address and I was sure that I didn't enable ipv6 on the wireless adapter. 

Then what if I unplug the external hard drive, plug it into another laptop, what will happen to both the hard drive and the documents that was being opened if I do the following actions from the another laptop? 

I'm moving from my old PC to a new one because the old one is broken (hard drive failure). I still have my files in Drive (now Backup & Sync) and I want to import those files to my new computer. But when I install Drive in my new PC, it just creates a new directory. 

But, still, it hasn't been successful. The warning always appears and gives me a lot of headaches. I can't install anything. Any help? :/ 

Inside of KeePass there is a hotkey Ctrl+H to show/hide the password when adding / editing an entry but that doesn't work on startup, please feel free to correct me if you have found a direct hotkey for showing/hiding the master password when entering into KeePass. My workaround is to just use this sequence of keys until there will be a real hotkey for it: Tab, Space then Backarrow to edit the now visible password. I do use a key together with my passphrase but I would not like to shorten the password trusting that the key won't autoload / someone looking for it will not find it. An acceptable shortcut would be to use my laptop's fingerprint sensor, but that is not doable as of 2017 / KeePass forum and 2017 / Reddit. 

Put my laptop into "hibernate" state instead of shutting it down Open the back of the laptop (I mean something like this) Pull out the hard-drive from the back Put the hard-drive into an external hard-drive casing, something like this: 

My cousin went into my home yesterday and he complained his laptop not being able to connect with the internet on my house (we use wireless connection). So he asked me to configure the internet connection, and he asked me to borrow my laptop too. I don't know what he did, but he succeed in connecting to the internet, but now my laptop is broken. There's a yellow warning sign on the traybar, it says IPv6 and IPv4 "No internet connectivity, and each time I try to diagnose, these errors appear often: 

Saw that in the device manager my external storage drive appears two times, once with an NTFS partition and once as a raw partition (see the screenshot). Tried to check the device with the builtin check disk utility but as I clicked to test it the window gone away as if it had done its job. From command line I tried it by and it yielded: chkdsk can not be run on the drive The type of the file system is RAW. CHKDSK is not available for RAW drives So now I did know that it has something wrong with its partition table and using the tool I was able to solve the problem by rewriting the MBR sector of each of the two storage drives with "Intel" and after a reboot the files were accessible again. 

Might only be tangentially related, but there's also this weird continuous blinking every time I open this website: $URL$ (despite the name, it's not a weird fetish and 100% safe for work) Here's a short video depicting what I meant: $URL$ Curiously other HTML5 video seems to be fine. It's not exactly the same blinking with the one I've described before, but I'd lke to know if it's somehow related. Thanks! 

I want to select whole line that contains the word . Fro the Search menu > Find, using will select whole line that contains the word . But using does not. What's the correct regex command? 

When it does connect, it runs really slow. However my other devices (smartphones) are okay, the problem only occurrs on my laptop, and my brother's laptop (which, oddly, wasn't touched by my cousin). This has never happened before... I asked my cousin what he did, but he claimed that he doesn't know and "it just works" for him. I know this lacks fruitful information, but I really don't have any clue to networking at all. May I ask for help? My router is linksys WRH54G... 

The explanation is very simple: When the remote system (Ubuntu) reboots as you commanded it, it will evidently close all programs and connections and reboot... closes the channel too over which putty is communicating - this is why you get the error message Server unexpectedly closed network connection. Although it says unexpectedly you should have been expecting it when you command it to reboot. To continue whatever you want with it you have to wait until it starts up then connect to it again. 

Format the document so to have new lines Remove the as the new lines are in sync w\out them Because of the formatting new lines are generated, so to remove double line breaks, I can do a find/replace with fast regexp: to
