I am getting a typical group by error that one would see when a field is not in a group by or an aggregate in the select. 

However, while only two states are pictured here, there could be 50 states. That part is done and looking good. The trouble I am having is to have the totals across all states at the bottom. At the very bottom of this post is a quick look at my parent report in SSRS design view, if that seems the best way to go. Below is an example source data table and my current query. The ordering doesn't really matter, it is just for ease of viewing. I am using a cross apply, but whether cross apply or pivot, it doesn't matter to me. 

If it matters, here is a screenshot of what I have in the detail view of the parent report. I am showing this to give context. Basically the parent report is a single cell of a table, which will feed a parameter to the sub reports, so the sub reports will only display records for a single payroll at a time. For instance, page one will be everything from payroll 1, etc... 

The problem is, as seen above, the records that have a and of 'IN', have a of "OH". This leads to the output to not contain SUI records for "IN" because no records have an of "IN" Is there any way to force "IN Employee SUI", "IN Employer SUI", etc... to appear with values of 0? There are many states where the State/SDI State and SUI State are different, so I cannot hard-code the logic in there. And here is some dumbed down similar data with my current query. The values aren't important in this question, only forcing the SUI records to appear for the state, "IN' 

If you want more, you need to increase the number of connections (backends) which default at 100, see this other part of the documentation 

This explains your results when ordering on except that Ä“ does not exists in code page 1252, so I have absolutely no ideas what it does with it. Or if we do the Unicode algorithm by hand, using the keys value of DUCET at $URL$ : step 1: Normalization form D, so each case becomes: 

In that way you do not "pollute" your table with input by users. It has the same "likes" as your own (you will just need an extra or similar) but not the dislikes. As the dislikes, it is another extra table, that has to be taken into account in your requests. You could even "merge" the 2 tables with just: if you specify in a constraint that either or are NOT NULL (but not both at the same time). You will then obviously need to accept having a lot of NULL values. But again, I recommend you to think about how you will query this data afterwards to find the model that most suits your needs. Also how often the "other" case could happen? It is more like 1%? 10%? 90%? The design and optimisations would depend on this too... 

But the algorithm by itself is a little dense. The gist of it is: Briefly stated, the Unicode Collation Algorithm takes an input Unicode string and a Collation Element Table, containing mapping data for characters. It produces a sort key, which is an array of unsigned 16-bit integers. Two or more sort keys so produced can then be binary-compared to give the correct comparison between the strings for which they were generated. You can view the specific Latin sorting rules here: $URL$ or more directly and specifically for MS SQL: $URL$ For the character it shows: 

I need to troubleshoot an issue I am having, and I need some help understanding how sp_msforeachdb works in order to overcome my issue. What happens is every time I run sp_msforeachdb, I get an error An example of my code is as follows: 

With tons of values in the Cross Apply, it just gets annoying. How can I easily export the definition of an object to have double/quad quotes? 

At my work, I am going to be moving millions of records to a different server, and removing them from the source server. My DBA has set up a backup scenario where change backups are taken every 5 minutes. He had this warning for me regarding deleting the records: 

And here is the results I get in SSRS preview. Not ordered how I want at all :( As far as I can tell, SSRS should support ORDER BY in the dataset query. I also tried removing the ISNULL( ,1000), and the order by still didn't function as desired. Thoughts? 

After desperately trying everything from restarting and updating SSRS, to clicking my heels three times and throwing salt over my shoulder, the solution is to not use the Microsoft Edge browser. When I switch to using Chrome/Firefox to run my SSRS reports, the behavior is removed. Microsoft Edge version: 38.14393.0.0 

I need to get some totals output in SSRS that I am having difficulty putting together. I am not sure if I should do the totals for the below query within the query, or in SSRS. The output is going to be presented as one long table in SSRS. I have some example DDL and fake desired output below, but to describe what I am doing, here is a quick snapshot of what I am trying to mimick in SSRS. 

I apparently cannot figure out the key words to google search for what I want, so I need help finding out how to do this. I feel like this may be a duplicate, but I just cannot find this anywhere else. I would like to be able to easily save a bunch of create table/view/proc scripts to a file. The file has an easy-to-execute format that will drop and then re-create all of the objects, so it can be run on multiple databases. This format works well for me as I have to make changes to some objects during development, and then make the same changes on multiple other databases. I can just change the database and click execute. However, some of the scripts have A LOT of quotes in them, and it gets QUITE annoying to have to double/quad quote them every time I make a change or add a new object to the file. For instance... 

So Amazon added some settings. You will need to contact them directly and ask since their documentation does not provide a result when doing a search, $URL$ gives Your search for "shared_heap_size" returned no results. 

The Unicode Collation Algorithm is described here: $URL$ Have a look at section 1.3 "Contextual Sensitivity" that explains that the sorting can not depend on just one character after the other as some rules are context sensitive. Note also these points in 1.8: 

and of course replace by the timestamp your are dealing with. This could be abstracted in the function that creates this based on the interval value and step you provide, for your specific timestamp. Not sure to have understood the exact truncation you want, so you may need to replace by . 

Update: adding Solomon Rutzky third case, which is trickier because of the space that enables new rules (I chose the "non-ignorable case"): step 1, NFD: 

This question is not so related to databases but more on Unicode handling and rules. Based on $URL$ Latin1_General_100_CS_AS means: "Collation uses the Latin1 General dictionary sorting rules and maps to code page 1252" with the added CS = Case Sensitive and AS = Accent Sensitive. The mapping between Windows code page 1252 and Unicode ($URL$ show the same values for all characters we are dealing with (except e with macron that does not exist in Microsoft mapping, so no idea what it does with this case), so we can concentrate on Unicode tools and terminology for now. First, let us know precisely what we are dealing with, for all your strings: 

step 4, Compare sort keys (simple binary comparison of each value one by one): The fourth value is enough to sort them all, so the final order becomes: 

Based on the description, this is related to Amazon Aurora product, and not PostgreSQL by itself. See $URL$ 

I have a view in which I need to Group By or SUM OVER Partition By year and quarter, but the year and quarter will be computed within the view. I would like to keep it all within a view instead of needing tables and SPs. The goal is to get SUMs by of all records within the first quarter of a year, spanning over multiple years. What I have is: 

Below is some sample code and data. I am trying to stay away from only using group by because I have ~30 columns that needed to be included, and having 25 columns in a group by seems...unfortunate. In the data you can see that Payroll 0048 has two records, and the column has a value of , essentially meaning the person was paid in two different checks. Conceptually, I need those two records summed up into one for the end result. However, things are complicated by the fact that I am using a cross apply to fill a business requirement that regular/over-time/double-time are expressed in new records instead of columns. The first select statement is without the SUM and GROUP BY functions to show what the data kind of looks like, but without the desired grouping and sum. The second select statement attempts to get the desired sum and group by, but gives the error. I am just having a heck of a time finding my problem. Could be an oversight or just a brain fart using CROSS APPLY wrong or something. I am also open using another method if there is a better way. As a side note, the is just a hack so I do not have to group by that also. 

However, it does not matter what query I have as a parameter to sp_msforeachdb. Every time I get the same error. I do have a database that starts with '61s1d', so that makes me think it has an issue with the DB name, but I honestly do not know what is going behind the scenes on sp_msforeachdb. Things to note.
