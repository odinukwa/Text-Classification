This is a catch-all that will match any host name not specified in any other directive. You are also correct when you note that when is missing, the block matches only requests without a header. Note that this probably won't work on nginx 0.7.x, which is antique and horribly out of date, and for which many things have changed. If you insist on using debian, please do yourself a favor and use the dotdeb repositories to keep current with software such as nginx, MySQL, and PHP, for which it's critical to update much more rapidly than Debian does. 

Maxmind is a good service, though occasionally there can be errors, since we're now in the time period where IPv4 blocks are scarce, and are being traded and resold on a gray market. If you do find an actual error you can report it to them, though this doesn't appear to be an error. This is basically how I confirm the location of an IP address: First, I'll see what Maxmind says about it. Their online tool tells me it's in Malaysia and registered to Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. But is it really? 

It appears you correctly commented out the directive in . But this change needs to be made on the remote server in order to have any effect there; while you seem to have made the change on your local machine. Therefore the change only has effect on your local mysqld, and not the remote mysqld you're trying to access. So you need to into the remote machine and make the change on the remote machine (and then restart mysqld there). You'll also have to check the remote machine's firewall to ensure that it allows you access. 

RPM and dpkg are both perfectly capable of checking package signatures - and of course allowing you to sign the packages. Why reinvent the wheel? If you're building an embedded system, ipkg and its fork opkg supposedly also can deal with signed packages, though documentation is sparse since ipkg is dead and opkg refers to the dead ipkg website... 

Maintain a local CentOS mirror on an Internet-connected machine with to a public CentOS mirror that accepts rsync connections. You can then copy these directories to a USB stick and use them as installation sources. They already carry the necessary metadata to act as repositories, so you only need to point the installer at them. 

The errors say that Apache was looking for SSL certificate configuration for some virtual hosts, but didn't find it. You do indeed have three virtual hosts configured that are missing their SSL directives. Try adding them in. 

Just re-enable the default virtual host and ignore anything that hits it (as such requests are querying the IP directly, or are malicious). For example, as seen in the nginx 1.12.x : 

Did you notice that the name of the kernel package you installed was ? Corresponding to that, you need to install to get the corresponding kernel source for compiling drivers against your kernel. You don't need to install any kernel headers other than this. 

Finally, the configuration listed in the article you linked seems fine. It's possible that you missed something while implementing it, or that Yahoo has decided it really doesn't like you. 

Not being able to resolve hosts is the issue they'll face. This means they won't seem to have Internet connectivity and will get strange errors like: 

You can't access the page directly because you specified in your configuration to not allow such requests. 

Also, consider deleting any queued mail (spam!) on the server, so that Postfix doesn't attempt to resend it. View the queue with and if you don't see anything legitimate, delete everything with . 

You "fix" it by getting a newer laptop. First, your laptop is using a six year old CPU (and is in power saving!) which isn't even really designed for server workloads. Second... no, that really is the root of the "problem." 

(But note that if you create the directory and leave it empty, the service will be masked and unable to start!) The use of a drop-in will also be shown whenever you request the service status. For example: 

The timestamp you gave in your example appears to be correct. It was about 18 minutes before you posted this question. It appears your server (I presume you have a good reason, but you might not) is configured with a timezone of US/Eastern or something similar. But logstash logs everything with UTC time, to prevent a wide variety of problems that occur when storing and processing local time. 

Every Seagate drive I've ever seen reports bizarre raw values for those two fields. One thing you can do is the same thing the utility (and drive) does internally: check the normalized value against the threshold value. When the value drops to the threshold, the attribute will report as failing (or failed). Another thing you can do is never buy another Seagate drive. I went this route, and I won't buy another until they learn to write firmware. 

You're on an OpenVZ (container) based virtual machine. As a result you have no control over the kernel; it is provided by your hosting provider, and you are limited to whatever the provider chooses to provide. If you want a different kernel, you either need to contact your hosting provider, or use something other than OpenVZ. 

Look at the file. This contains information on all the mount points that the system mounts automatically. One line will almost certainly refer to and this is the one you will look for. It will probably look something like this: 

This directive is used (along with others) to set up client certificate authentication. It should not be present at all if you do not intend to use client certificates. 

The php.ini setting only affects the time zone of your running PHP scripts. It is separate from the server timezone, which is probably set to UTC (according to best practices). 

By default, the list of keys that a user can use to log in to any particular node is stored in on the node being logged into. The private key that the user uses to make connections is stored in the node which originates the connection. If you want to prevent a user logging in using a particular key, you can simply remove it from their file. But be aware that the user can always put it back themselves, if they can log in to that node or otherwise access that file. You can also change the path to the authorized keys file by setting in to a file which the user cannot access. But keep in mind that this will apply to all users. As for determining how a user authenticated, that information is in your log file . For example: 

In other words, the BIOS decides which onboard NIC is NIC 1 and which is NIC 2. Thus, I suspect that you had a system BIOS update at some point between your installation of CentOS 6 and your installation of Fedora 21. Also note that the structure of the names themselves has changed in RHEL/CentOS 7 and Fedora, compared to RHEL/CentOS 6. In EL6, embedded NICs begin with and a number, and NICs on expansion cards start with followed by their bus, slot and function. This was the original biosdevname feature. In Fedora and RHEL 7 biosdevname has been replaced with native systemd support, and the device naming scheme has changed. All wired NICs begin with , and onboard NICs continue with and a number, while NICs on expansion cards continue with , the bus number, , the slot number, and optionally and the function number. (Though, if you upgrade in place from EL6 to EL7, the old-style names will be kept.) An example of what you'll see from my own systems: Onboard NICs (in a Dell PowerEdge):
