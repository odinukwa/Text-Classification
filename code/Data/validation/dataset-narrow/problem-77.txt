Plug the computer into the network. Wait for the interface to be active. Depending on spanning tree it could be close to a min. Start Wireshark and choose the right interface. Release RENEW your ip address. On windows open a command prompt and run this command. 

Done with recovery. If you want to factory reset there are two things that need deleted. Startup config and the vlan database. Issue these commands and answer no to saving anything. 

Make sure Wireshark promiscuous mode is turned on. It's under capture options in the gui. I'm assuming your using an atheros chip wifi card or something compatible. Also, make sure your not joined to any SSIDs. I normally don't like links in an answer but we'll call this a bonus. It's a how to with detailed instructions for diffrent distributions of OS's and is extremely long or i I'd post it. wireless monitor mode with Wireshark 

Here's a great link for Windows 2012r2 and cisco. I know it's not great to just supply a link but it's so helpful I wanted to share. If I could do a comment instead I would. Link for server 2012r2 and Cisco 

You may try turning off 802.11r in the AP and make sure your IOS is 10 or higher in case it's conflicting. IOS 10 and up have adaptive 801.11r and do not need it turned on in the AP. Reference link to Apple doc... Quote from Apple... 802.11r When your iOS device roams from one AP to another on the same network, 802.11r uses a feature called Fast Basic Service Set Transition (FT) to authenticate more quickly. FT works with both preshared key (PSK) and 802.1X authentication methods. iOS 10 includes support for adaptive 802.11r on Cisco wireless networks. Adaptive 802.11r offers FT without the need to enable 802.11r on the configured Cisco wireless network. If that doesn't work out you could look into this. It was used before 11r. OKC option... I may have overlooked it in the config but have you tried opportunistic key caching OKC as described in this doc link to extensive Cisco doc instead of PKC and is there a Validate PMKID option? I didn't see it but this may be beneficial. 

Here's a less technical answer if your interested. Let's forget MDI-X for the moment. MDI-X is the automatic decision process of where to put transmit and receive. Also, I'm not discussing POE because there are diffrent types. Transmit and receive on 10/100mb are traditionally on the orange and green pair. If your switch transmits on orange your computer needs to receive on orange and vice versa. If the both transmit on the same pair they'd never communicate. The data would collide. Since two like switches might transmit on orange (it might be green I don't remember) their transmit is going into the other ports transmit. One transmit needs to go to the others receive. That's why you need a crossover cable to connect two switches together for example. Then came MDI-X. This figures out if the transmit and receive need to be reversed on one end and eliminates the need for a crossover cable. (side note, a cross over cable is a 568A on one end and a 568B on the other (orange and green are swapped)). 

If your home wap has vlan capability you can create two SSID's. Assign each SSID to a vlan. Then, assign ACLS (access control lists) to allow them to get to the Internet but block them from your addresses. Some home WAPs also have guest mode and features that don't let computers talk to other computers on the same network. To add... you can get a robust firmware for alot of home style WAPS like these --> click 

It may be packet tracer. It's not perfect. I've never used telnet with packet tracer. Your command looks good and it should have prompted you. If you want to try another way do Line vty 0 4 Login local This will use the same password you set for the switch password. The term local refers to the local TACASAS database in Cisco devices or Radius server if your using it to log into the switch or router. 

Verify distance limitations of the GBICs. Make sure the speed commands (if any) match at both ends. Verify it's a compatible GBIC for Cisco. (There are unofficial commands to use non-Cisco GBICs but I'll let you research that and use at your own risk) Verify you have fiber transmit and receive flipped on one end. If fiber A is on the left make sure fiber B is on the left at the other end. If you're not sure just try flipping one end. It'll light up if that's the issue. Try the command on the interface. I've had to do this with 3750's and 3850's in the past. 

I'm in the process of studying to renew my CCNP again. 3 years comes and goes awful fast! While working on my lab gear I thought I wonder if I can shut down STP on a single interface like I've done in HP and Delta networks in the past. This particular set up was 2 Cisco 3750 48 port poe. Version 12 something. I'll need to double check exact version. I have interfaces 1-4 plugged directly into one another on the two switches. Port 1 to 1, 2 to 2, etc. The switches only had vlan 1. Port 1 on both switches were access ports and 2-4 were dynamic (default) but the operational mode was access in since there are no other vlans on the switches. Both switches were in mode rstp. On the root switch I decide to use context sensitive help and see if I could stop STP on interface 1. Here's what I typed... Enable Config t Int f1/0/1 No Spanning-tree vlan 1 Exit Exit Show Spanning-tree vlan 1 The response I received was there was no spanning tree instance running! What the heck! I was on an interface. It was running just before that. It's easy to replicate as well. Questions.. 1. Has anyone else ran into this or know if this is a known bug in version 12 or just a known "gotcha" ? (I'll get my exact version in a bit) 

I would need to see the routing commands and tables of all 3 to tell you why it didn't route. is a command used to keep the router from summarizing classes of networks. It doesn't add information for networks that aren't advertised in the router rip command. I'm a bit confused on your interpretation of what it should do or maybe I could explain better. Basic examples with and without auto-summary. If you use Rip or EIGRP as with auto-summary (by leaving it as is) and you put the router will interpret that as and that's what will be in the routing table because the 10 network is a class A address. If you had 'network 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0' and network '10.10.20.0 255.255.255.0' on two diffrent rows and didn't add the command both routers would advertise 10.0.0.0 basically ignoring the subnet address and the routing wouldn't work properly. If you use no-auto summary it will interpret the address as is if you use the subnet address. will advertise 10.10.10.0/24 and show properly in the routing table on one router and would advertise 10.10.20.0/24 and show properly as well. 

The term trunk port means different things to diffrent vendors. For example, in Cisco it is a port that uses multiple VLANs normally used to connect two switches together so all vlans traverse the network. It can be used for other devices like ip phones that need more than 1 vlan. In HP it is the combining of multiple interfaces between switches to carry more traffic. It's a bundle or aggregation of interfaces(ports) via programming and physical connection. 

HP Procurve uses the same command, IP helper-address 111.222.333.444 as Ron mentioned is used for Cisco IoS. Cisco SMB switches like the SG300 use ip dhcp relay address 111.222.333.444. The list is endless really. That's not my purpose. I just wanted to add the "why" you need to use this command if you want to use one DHCP server for multiple VLANs/subnets. Since a layer 2 network is broadcast domain the DHCP request from a computer normally will stay within its VLAN because it's a UDP broadcast. Broadcast, as you may know, can't traverse a layer 3 boundary (a router or layer 3 switches). By adding the IP helper-address command at the gateway the layer 3 device can forward the UDP request from the computer for DHCP to the server (and other protocols such as TFTP(port 69), DNS (port 53), BOOTP (port 67, 68), TACACS (port 49), the older Time service (port 37, not NTP), NetBIOS (port 137, 138). 

Show or will give you the interface (the given name, not the name you assign it) and MAC Addresses. Some switches/ios versions have a slight variation of the command. That's why I showed it two different ways. It will show multiple MAC addresses on the uplink port that connects to other switches. EDIT-adding content** The column title in the command is a destination address. It identifies the mac address that is on that port. The MAC table or CAM table only records source addresses. I'm not sure why it's labeled Destination Address. I know you don't want to know about the ARP command but this command and the ARP command together you can find devices on your switches. Here is a quote from www.packet6.com... "The CAM table, or content addressable memory table, is present in all Cisco Catalysts for layer 2 switching. It is used to record a stations mac address and itâ€™s corresponding switch port location." Example: Port 17 has a device plugged in with this mac address. If you were looking for a device you could ping it, look at the arp table to get the mac then use the mac command to find the port. 

Now do a show 'show vtp status' revision should be zero. Add or remove a vlan on the switch that is a vtp server and it should show up in less than a min. Usually, in a few seconds. Also, make sure your up links between switches are programmed as trunk ports. Vtp only goes switch to switch on trunk port, not access ports. Also make sure they are using the same version. If the server switch is v2 and a client is v1 decide what version you want based on features and switch capability. The command to set version is ...
