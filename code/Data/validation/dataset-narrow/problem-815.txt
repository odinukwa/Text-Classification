I'm trying to get a list of all Exchange accounts, format them in descending order from largest mailbox and put that data into an email in HTML format to email to myself. So far I can get the data, push it to a text file as well as create an email and send to myself. I just can't seem to get it all put together. I've been trying to use ConvertTo-Html but it just seems to return data via email like "pageFooterEntry" and "Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Internal.Format.AutosizeInfo" versus the actual data. I can get it to send me the right data if i don't tell it to ConvertTo-Html, just have it pipe the data to a text file and pull from it, but it's all ran together with no formatting. I don't need to save the file, i'd just like to run the command, get the data, put it in HTML and mail it to myself. Here's what I have currently: 

I've just started testing wireless for our building, we plan to implement it across the board this fiscal year. Currently we have no wireless except in our IT area (DSL for outside testing). I've borrowed a Cisco LAP1142N AP from a friend that works in another sister organization, they have these and had an extra. I've plugged it in and it talks to their controller just fine, etc. The question i have is...what is the "average" radius i can expect from this device? I know it's not an easy thing to say specifically, based on the environment and obstructions, interference, etc. We are in a typical cubible environment for the most part with offices on the outer walls. I've set it up and have used WaveDeploy to survey both of the devices we have, the Cisco and the SOHO Linksys Wireless-G router. Both seem to put out the same radius of coverage. I get slightly better speeds with the Cisco device but expected it to also cover more area. I have a decent signal up to about 35-40 feet away, then drops off pretty quickly. So really there are two questions here: is there a reason that this Cisco device isn't pushing out a stronger signal (i've asked the friend who manages the controller, he says they're not turned down or anything as far as he knows) than the Linksys, and secondly, why would i want to pay 10 times the cost per AP, as well as have to buy a $10k controller if the Linksys will pretty much deliver the same coverage? I'm assuming i'm missing something as far as the Cisco device goes but so far it's not obvious to me. I'm just now reading about and learning the wireless world, so i'd appreciate any thoughts or input on this from some more experienced wireless gurus out there. Thanks! 

I've been slowly working on a script that will do everything I normally do for a new employee when they start. So far it all seems to be fine except one thing. Here's what I have: Loads Quest snap-in. Prompts for specific information for the user. Gets information about a current similar employee for reference and pipes it into the new employee, minus the specific information I'm prompting for. Creates the AD account. Gets group information of current employee and put the new user in the same groups. Loads Exchange credentials and mail-enables the new user. Goes to the File server and creates their home drive and gives specific rights as needed. All works fine, except that when the new user is created, I can't login as them until I have went into ADUC and reset their password, unchecked "User must change password at next logon". It all looks fine, all the fields are populated, but when I go to OWA to test login, it says bad username and/or password. I've tried telling the script to manually uncheck the box, reset the password, disable, re-enable the account, etc. The commands execute just fine, no errors, but it seems like none of that works. But, if I right click on the user, select reset password, type in a password and uncheck the box, then I can immediately logon afterward. So, it seems like there's another setting somewhere that I'm missing with the script that is happening when I do it manually. Here is the command I'm using to try and replicate what I'm doing manually: 

All results come back positive. I have looked at the certificate store on my local machine, I see a certificate under Personal/Certificates issues by Communications Server, and from what I've seen online this is part of the Polycom/Lync setup. I don't however see anything similar in the Trusted Root store...should it have something in there? In AD Attributes I verified my msRTCSIP-PrimaryUserAddress setting is the same as my SMTP address, but my sAMAccountName is different to logon to the domain (saw one place saying this had to be the same, but others saying only the SMTP/SIP needed to be the same) and the same as my UserPrincipalName. So anyway, I'm kind of at a loss, I have tried everything I can think of and so far I've had no luck getting this phone to connect up to Lync. Exchange and Lync seem to work fine, OWA, EWS, Autodiscover, DNS settings are all right, but for some reason this won't connect. If anyone has an idea of something I could try, I would be very appreciative. Thanks in advance! 

I've been looking online for this answer, but getting conflicting information. I was under the impression that you couldn't use a VLAN across a router, but maybe it's possible (according to some documentation I see online)? I was hoping someone could clear it up for me. Here's what I'm working with: We have a remote site with a handful of users. We recently gave them an access point (Cisco 1142n) for internal wireless. It's plugged into a switch and working fine (getting IPs from the same DHCP scope as the wired users are getting). Private wireless is set on VL50. At the home office we have private wireless for our internal network working and on VL50, with a test VLAN setup for VL60, which points to our DSL line for the time being. Both private and public wireless works fine internally (not crossing a router). VL50 is named the same at both sites for consistency in naming. If we wanted to give the remote site access to the public wireless (VL60), would that be possible across the routers? For more information, currently the site is connected to the home office via a T1 connection, Cisco routers on both ends. I didn't think it was possible due to the nature of VLANS being layer 2. But, I am from from an expert on this and would appreciate any instruction as to the actual truth of the matter. The end result I'm going for is, how to get our remote sites access to a public (outside) connection along with their private connection, without actually having a DSL (or similar type line) dropped at their location? Thanks in advance for your thoughts. 

I am currently trying to setup a new instance of MDT 2010 and would like to export my Out of box Drivers from the current MDT solution we have, into the new one. I tried simply copying the contents of the folder over but the drivers don't show up in the snap-in. Is there a way to export them from my "old" system and into the "new" system, without having to manually import the drivers all over again? I know I can setup up a Link Deployment, but I'm hesitant to do this as I don't want to accidentally overwrite the new MDT setup which is working perfectly (except for missing those drivers). I just need the drivers really, I've changed the way everything else works on the new system. Any suggestions would be much appreciated, thanks! 

I'm currently trying to setup a Polycom CX600 to test the operability with Lync. We have been using Lync for several months, but only really using the IM aspect. I didn't set the Lync server up initially but am trying to troubleshoot where the problem may lie. I'll explain my setup to better help track the problem down. Lync Server 2013 is installed on Windows 2008 R2. Domain Controller is Windows Server 2008, DHCP/DNS server role. To my knowledge there was no DHCP setup on the Lync server itself. My client is Windows 7 x64, fully patched. Lync client is 2013. We just have one Lync server being used internally, nothing on the outside, no federation, etc. Here's what I did: 

I'm currently trying to setup a task that will email me when the deployment has finished. It seems fairly simple, and I've looked online as a reference. I found one person (Johan I believe) that had a custom ZTISendMail.wsf file that you can install as an application, but even that seems like it's above and beyond what I need. I could be wrong, if so please correct me. What I have is a short .vbs script that when run sends me an SMTP mail. It works from my computer just fine, as well as the deployment server (when double clicked). I've tried placing it on the root of the deployment server, then adding a command line task sequence as the very last step. I've tried with just the command line in there as well as , both give me the same results at the end (failure). I have tried setting "Start in" as C:\ as well to no avail. Am I missing something? This seems like it would be fairly simple to just run the vbs script which would shoot a message off to me. Why is it having a problem running it? Thanks. 

I'm running into a problem here, and I'm positive it's simply that I'm not doing something correct (as opposed to it not working). I have a current Exchange 2007 server setup with a third party cert for it on TMG. I'm currently testing Exchange 2010 and wanted to test OWA and Activesync as well (I'm the only mailbox on the server so far). For the life of me I can't figure out how to issue a self-signed cert and install it on the TMG server so that when i go to "mail.company.com" it likes it. I've done quite a bit of looking online but so far have yet to get a working solution. My last attempt I did this: Open Chrome, attempt to go to mail.company.com. It sees the cert as not trusted, i then export that cert to the desktop (this was done from my PC). Copy that cert to the TMG server. Open up certmgr and add that certificate to the Personal/certificate group (via import). Import was successful and I now see that cert as well as the working Exchange 2007 cert in there that folder. Open Forefront TMG and go to Firewall policy, add a new Web Listener, require SSL, select All Networks, click select certificates and I see the current 2007 Exchange cert there from the 3rd party, but not the one I just imported. What am I missing here? I do see that the certs in there that are available (and currently being used) are all "Class 3 International Server" certs, if that is relevant. The one I imported is issued by our Domain Controller. I just want to try to use the self signed cert for testing, to make sure it all works before moving forward. We will eventually just edit our current Exchange cert to work with the new Exchange server. It's been awhile since I messed with this, and I'm obviously missing something. If anyone could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it. Thanks! 

Currently I have a working MDT 2010 server that has been humming along for awhile with no issues. We've decided to upgrade to Office 2010 and I was trying to layer it into MDT as well. It seems for some reason that it's not using the .msp file saved in the Updates folder during installation. I've found several articles online to verify that I set it up the proper way (or so I think), yet something is still not working. We used to do a full layered approach with MDT. We would install the base OS and then install applications as needed. But, we pretty much have the same programs on every computer so I sysprep and captured a machine when it was up to date. Now with this Office install, I was just wanting to install it via a task sequence like we did on our previous solution (I still have it for reference even and it all appears to be setup the same). I have added the application into the MDT workbench. Created an entry in the task sequence telling it to run the program. I have created a custom .msp file that tells it the key and a few other changes. The .msp file is saved into the updates folder and all appears fine. When I attempt to build a machine, it still prompts me for which version of Office I want instead of picking the ProPlus selection I've specified in the customization file. I can't for the life of me figure out what is stopping it from reading that file. I have tried modifying the .xml file even but it never saves the settings, I'm guessing maybe it doesn't want those settings used if it sees an .msp file in the folder(?). I know this Office and .msp install work as I've manually installed it and had it auto-install via startup script on a dozen end-users, but when using it in MDT it seems to ignore the .msp file. I've also tried to delete and recreate the .msp file in case of corruption. All articles I find online look similar to what I've tried, which is pretty straightforward. Thoughts? Thanks!
