As mentioned, there's no way to set the timeout to less than one minute. You can hotkey this with Monitor Off Utility though. 

Are you using the same cable on both? Have you tried another output on the laptop? This sounds like there's actually a problem with one of the pinouts between the two, which could be a faulty cable or a faulty port; the easiest thing is to swap either of those variables. I think you're probably looking at the laptop, though. One other good way to check that it's not a video issue is to do screen captures on the machine in question and view them on another - odds are the color balance will look fine, which leads you back to an issue other than the video card. 

Unplug everything you can possibly unplug, internally and externally, and remove all expansion cards and RAM. So, with nothing but the main ATX power header and CPU power header (and front panel and internal speaker connections attached - see comments) attached and no RAM, if the box STILL won't power on, you probably either have a power supply or motherboard problem (the odds of a failed CPU are nil unless you've been overclocking like crazy, and if you're savvy enough to do that you shouldn't be asking this question). If it beeps at you, which it should if you try to power it on with no RAM, reattach stuff piece by piece (starting with the RAM) to see if you can isolate a problem. 

This could be a problem with the power supply, the processor, or the motherboard. The only way to be really sure is to swap components with known working ones. (It's pretty unlikely to be anything else, for whatever that's worth.) If you can provide more detail about what exactly the components in the machine are, I could probably speculate as to which component is most likely, at least. (I assume you reconnected the 4-pin afterwards, just to rule out the possibility that it was loose or something.) 

We have a client who has a machine using an extremely high resolution output setup (3 30" monitors in portrait mode for a total resolution of 4800x2560.) He routinely remotes into this machine but the performance is lousy - we're looking for the highest fidelity remote desktop solution available for this. TeamViewer, GoToMeeting, and LogMeIn have proved inadequate. Should we be looking into Citrix or something like that (none of us have any experience with it)? Basically what we need is the lowest-latency, highest performance app we can get. (The client realizes remote connections will never be up to speed but at the very least a reasonable amount of color fidelity would be nice.) Bandwidth isn't currently a consideration here - we'll end up testing any solutions for real world performance but we really need to know where to look. I'm sure we can manage SOME kind of improvement. 

Judging from your screenshot, you have two displays in span mode, whereby the drivers trick Windows into thinking there's only one big, oddly shaped monitor connected. Turn this off in the nVidia control panel, and then the Windows display properties should show you two different monitors rather than one big virtual one. Then you can configure them to be extended and you should get the behavior you want. 

The vast majority of OEMs have had to move to 16:9 simply because it's getting hard to get 16:10 panels that are acceptably priced for inclusion in a laptop; about all you can find these days are higher end IPS panels, etc. It's even worse with 4:3 displays, especially if you want something bigger than a netbook. I know Lenovo still has a 14" 16:10 (ThinkPad T410). 

The identify numbers don't matter. They are just for your benefit in, yaknow, identifying the monitors, and could just as easily be color coded or something. You can drag the monitors around so that they work correctly but it's irrelevant what the numbers actually are - 2 can be on the left, 7 can be the primary, whatever. (The display in front of me right now is, left to right, 2 - 1 - 3.) If you're just OCD and you HAVE to have 1 on the left, you're out of luck; this is determined by how the monitors are physically cabled to the card so you'd have to switch the cables. (I'm not sure why yours switched spontaneously, I'm guessing a driver update.) 

If it's getting hot under load, and you're not doing anything that you've not been doing before, I'd suspect it's more physical factors than software problems, more specifically inadequate cooling! You should open the machine and check for dust and operation of any and all fans. You might also consider removing, reapplying thermal paste, and reseating the heatsink on the processor, although that may be easier said than done in a small-form factor Mac (I'm not familiar with the internals on this so I couldn't say myself). 

Why can't you just use the older driver that works properly? I am a strong believer that there is no reason to update a driver unless it introduces a specific feature or bugfix that you need - especially in the case of video drivers, nVidia and ATI both love to introduce new "features" in their drivers that often break certain configurations. This is almost certainly an introduced bug. 

This is probably the same reason that you never see a full 4GB on a 32-bit build - namely, that some system device has reserved some of that memory for its own use at boot. It's hard to say without knowing your exact build, but most typically this happens with onboard video chipsets that don't have any dedicated RAM of their own. 

I have no specific knowledge regarding the exact chemicals involved here, nor have I ever seen an MSDS for this stuff. Now, that said: I used to work for a laptop manufacturer doing support, and we were instructed that in the event that a customer ever called reporting a leaking LCD we were to IMMEDIATELY tell them to hang up the phone, call emergency services, and get a hazmat team onsite, while we escalated the call to our internal dedicated safety response team. That seems like a pretty harsh response (it's more severe than what I would have been expected to do for anything short of "My laptop set my house on fire") so I'm inclined to think this stuff isn't especially safe. It may be true that it's only a hazard if ingested, though; based on my semi-limited knowledge of the chemistry involved that seems possible. If it were me, though, I'd take the extra cautious route just in case. (In practice, this basically never happens short of a severe puncture like a blade would cause because of the way these things are manufactured. I've actually never personally heard of a situation where an LCD was leaking short of taking a bullet.) EDIT: Let me just make this stronger. This hardly ever happens, ever, anywhere, ever - it's designed to prevent exactly this sort of problem. Unless you actually witness it in action there is probably no reason to worry about it. See further discussion in comments. 

The simplest way is probably visual inspection - a lot of motherboards have the model number screenprinted very visibly on the PCB! Aside from that, there are a good number of ways to do it in software - if you're running Windows (taking a guess here, please add more detail to the question if you're not) the system summary of msinfo32 will probably show the model number. 

One good tool in Windows 7 - from a command prompt, do . (This may require running the command prompt with administrative privileges.) 

Random write as in it writes data to random locations all over the drive (this is similar to what average usage of a machine does - writes a small log file here, a small cookie there, etc), 4K as in the size of the files (aka fairly small). Aligned here refers to the internal logic - 4K tends to be the page size on these things, so you're not trying to make two writes at once if they're properly aligned with the boundaries (which would obviously hurt speed). IOPS are Input/Outputs per Second, more obviously being better. Note though that not all drives are created equal. I recommend you read some reviews before you pull the trigger - AnandTech is great for advice on SSDs. 

Reflowing works by heating the solder and hopefully restoring any minute connections to, say, capacitors, that have come undone due to mechanical or thermal stress. You often see this for all sorts of electronics and it's not really that unusual. It probably won't last forever, but it's better than nothing. 

I found this thread on the Netbeans forums which seems to indicate it that manually adding an exception to the Synaptics app may solve it (and at least one other person who thinks it might be a Java problem as well). Here's a good version of what appears to be the same directions for adding the exception. (You don't mention what OS you're using so I assume it's the out-of-the-box Windows). If nothing else, it's certainly a known problem. 

The base load on that machine appears to be 6GB of RAM so they probably have never shipped it with anything but a 64-bit operating system. That said, I'd assume it has the same hardware as the rest of the 15R series, more or less - try a lower end machine and you'll probably be able to find 32-bit drivers. 

DisplayPort 1.2 supports daisy-chaining like this in the spec, but I am not aware of any products on the market that currently support it, either on the video card side or the monitor side. I expect you'll see them in the next year or so, though, now that the specifications are official (and I believe there are already controllers entering production). 

If the machine it's shared with is already getting the 4G connection and using it properly for internet, it's probably easiest just to set up Internet Connection Sharing on that connection over the LAN in Windows 7. (It's possible I'm misreading you regarding the connectivity here, in which case please clarify.) 

There's no need to pirate; you can download the ISOs for Windows 7 installation media directly from Microsoft (well, okay, Digital River's hosting the download but whatever), free of charge. 32-bit Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit Windows 7 Professional 64-bit Windows 7 Professional Links taken from here. I can't personally confirm they're live, but I've done this in the past and they look the same as I remember. EDIT: Removed Ultimate links since they appear to be dead, but they're out there. Somebody feel free to comment and/or edit these in. 

The encryption naturally adds overhead, which will lower the speed of read and writes just like on a platter drive. It shouldn't negatively impact the lifespan of the drive unless it's an encryption scheme which requires a lot of additional writes, or the particular sorts of data patterns that are getting written are a lot more susceptible to write amplification on your particular drive (which is awfully unlikely and basically impossible to know ahead of time). Most brand-new drives are actually using controller-based garbage collection, etc; this all is happening way below the OS level so it should be irrelevant what the data is. TRIM specifically I'm not 100% sure on, but the actual functionality is again happening on the controller level so it should be fine as well. Note that all of this may vary from drive to drive because the biggest variable is the controller on the SSD. 

What KIND of volume did you make (this is the very first thing it asks you, as I recall)? There are multiple kinds of RAID arrays available - it sounds like you made a RAID1 array, which is for redundancy, when you meant to make a RAID0 array, which is for increased capacity/speed. You should be able to select the array and change the type (or disable entirely) from the RST interface. EDIT: If this is the current active system volume (i.e., Windows is installed on it) there's no way to easily disable a RAID0 this after the fact. You'll need to change it from the RAID BIOS (usually Ctrl+I as the system is booting up for Intel controllers), but this will completely wipe the contents of the drives. You need to either clone the installation off to a third drive, and then clone it back on, or just format and start from scratch. 

This does look like VRAM corruption - it's not unusual to see junk data like this but get some functionality. Unless you're an expert solderer and have an identical card to scavenge the VRAM chips from (and even then I'm not sure how feasible a replacement would be), you'll just have to assume this card can't be fixed. 

Changing the display language of a Windows installation is only supported in Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise. On other editions (possibly not Starter, as it has strange restrictions, but certainly Home and Professional builds) you can install a Language Interface Pack, but this only translates a small portion of the most commonly used interface elements. Please see this link for downloads and further details. 

This card should support two displays, but not three. (I have not tested this particular card but this would be normal behavior for this generation of GeForce.) 

There are two major things to consider: run in AHCI mode and make sure the partition is aligned correctly. For your particular problem you might try disabling write-back caching on the drive but I don't normally recommend this. Depending on the particular SSD you have (can you post the model?) it may make no difference anyway. It's also important to manually run TRIM if your SSD supports it (again, this depends on model and firmware). And, of course, turn off automatic defragmentation of the disk. (I do STRONGLY recommend an upgrade to Windows 7 if you're serious about running with an SSD boot drive. It's much better at handling these things.) 

This depends on the motherboard, but typically with current Intel chips the integrated graphics will nicely exist alongside one or more dedicated GPUs. That is to say, for the vast majority of new motherboards you won't have to do a thing (or at worst you'll have to designate the offboard graphics as having priority over the onboard graphics, or if you want to use both explicitly tell it if it's a board that disables the onboard by default). 

I think I'm going to say "There's no way to do this". I've only been looking for almost a year now. :) 

As long as you buy your components from Lenovo or an authorized reseller and they are a valid Lenovo FRU Part Number for the machine in question they will carry the warranty of the machine. Only physical abuse would invalidate your warranty. This is true for anything that's classified as customer replaceable - practically this is hard drives, Ultrabay devices, RAM, WLAN and WWAN adapters. 

You're correct; physical destruction is the only good way to do this (you'd need a magnet so strong that it's not feasible to get one for most people unless you're on staff at the Large Hadron Collider). Professional disposal operations generally do this with an industrial metal shredder. For you, bending the platters with a hammer, sandpapering them, and then running a drill through them in multiple points is sufficient to stop anything but advanced forensic data recovery. If you're really concerned about even that, or you just want style points, you might try thermite. It is usually sufficient to melt the platters entirely. 

PicPick should do this, and has some other decent options as well as good markup tools. As a bonus, it's totally free for non-commercial use.
