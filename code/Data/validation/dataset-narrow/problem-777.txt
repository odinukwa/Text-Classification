Our company just migrated to Windows 7 and decided to use the included "balanced" power plan. The main problem with this is that I use powershell to do remote management and sleeping machines don't respond to these commands. Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can send out a signal to wake up only sleeping machines? Now, I already know that I can use the "Magic Packet" with wake on LAN, but that has a few problems. 

Scheduled Tasks is what you need. You can set a trigger for both workstation lock and workstation unlock. If you need to deploy it out to more machines, use SCHTASKS.EXE (provided with windows). Hope that helps 

We've begun our migration to windows 7 and we ran into an interesting issue. When we hit "CTRL+ALT+DEL" we are brought to the "User selection Screen". Normally, this screen will have an icon for every local user for the machine. These machines are Domain members with "Fast User Switch" disabled so no user names are listed only the "Other User" option. If you click "Other User" or hit enter, the system moves on to the normal login screen where it prompts for user name and password. Here's the issue: We want to find a way to skip over the part where a user selects "Other User". We essentially want the system to always assume that we always want "Other User" and to go directly to the login screen when a user hits "CTRL+ALT+DEL". What I find odd is that the "Other User" doesn't show up until we've had more than one domain user log in. Right after we re-image the machine, the login process goes directly to the user credential prompt. [EDIT] Security Policies set by Active Directory: 

Our IT environment provides 10 shared, Microsoft Windows 7 laptops for an office staff of several hundred people. After checking-out and logging into a laptop with an Active Directory domain account, office staff frequently run Microsoft Outlook 2010. However, the first time office staff do this, Microsoft Outlook 2010 prompts the user to create and configure their local account. This takes just several clicks, as Microsoft Outlook 2010 auto-detects the office staff member's Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 (SP3) account. The problem is: all office staff have to do this on each new laptop they use. Until they do so, some functionality does not work (for example, Microsoft Word 2010 Save & Send fails with error "There was a problem creating the message"). How might our IT department "pre-configure" the shared laptops so office staff can simply log-in and use Microsoft Outlook 2010 functionality without the need to configure a local account? 

Since password policy represents a form of access control, and RFC 959 specifies no password reset mechanism, it seems reasonable to conclude each FTP server implementation decides if/how to support FTP client-initiated password resets. In practice, this represents what we see: 

We wish to solve the business problem of how to schedule automated password updates, on a remote FTP server (note: z/OS) over which we have no administrative control, before the password expires. For example, once each month, update user JDoe's password, both locally and on remote FTP server ftp.abc.com. Our business process necessitates transferring files, using protocol FTPS, to/from a remote FTP server (note: z/OS). A separate organization administers this remote FTP server, providing our team with a user account but no server-level administrative control. FTP server policy automatically expires user account passwords, after a period of time. When this happens, FTP server staff require the person tied to the named account to call their FTP server help desk, to verify their identity. Upon successful verification, FTP server help desk staff reset the password, requiring the user to choose a new password upon the next login. The FTP server allows users to reset their password via the command-line, by setting password to string "oldpw/newpw/newpw"; subsequently, users login with only "newpw". FTP server administrators will not set an FTP user password to never expire. Years ago, a now-retired team member created an in-house app to perform this task, using FTPS functionality provided by ComponentPro "FTP/SSL Client Component for .NET". Per resource constraints, we'd prefer a solution we don't have to maintain in-house. Note: if possible; if in-house represents the way to go, so be it. How can we do this better? 

It really depends on the applications. Supercedence is only really used when the {GUID} changes. This is normally caused by a major version change (version 3 to version 4). A well maintained software title will only update the version number when doing minor updates (v3.0 to v3.1). You will also find that many msi based software titles will install on top of your old version without issue. Now to your question, SCCM has a pre-built report called "Count inventoried products and versions for a specific product". This will report a count of all inventoried versions of a software. You can then use the "Computers with a specific product name and version" to get a list of computers that have old versions. From what I have been able to find for best practices, you want to keep all application packages that are currently in use. Once the software is no longer in your environment, you can retire the package and delete it once you know not having it isn't causing problems. You can also make a folder in your application management section to store old application packages. SCCM uses unique IDs for everything and doesn't really care how you organize your objects. 

I am running into an interesting issue with some applications not evaluating properly in SCCM 2012. The example software I have is Adobe reader 11. When I install using an MSI deployment through software center, everything works great. The problem comes up when someone goes to the adobe website and downloads the executable installer and runs that. Now software center detects the software as uninstalled and will list is as an available title. I am using the "Windows installer" detection method and looking for this GUID "{AC76BA86-7AD7-1033-7B44-AB0000000001}". When I look in the AppDiscovery.log, all I get is an "+++ Application not discovered." message. So here's the question: Where can I see what the detection method is querying and what it gets back? Bonus Question: When performing a "Windows Installer" detection, where does the system look for that GUID? Thanks in advance 

Windows Command-line scriptable, so we can automate it...sorry, FileZilla (?) FTPS, as it seems to perform better than SFTP The ability to send KeepAlive commands to the FTPS control port during a transfer No passwords sent on the command line...sorry, curl 

BACKGROUND Each FTP server implementation decides if/how to invoke access controls, per File Transfer Protocol (FTP) technical specification RFC 959: 

Start > Run... > perfmon Select menu View > Customize... Uncheck option "Standard menus (Action and View)" Select button "OK" 

What FTP Service versions of Microsoft Internet Information Services, if any, support the proposed (and now expired?) FTP server command extension MFMT? NOTES The proposed MFMT ("Modify Fact: Modification Time") FTP command extension modifies a file or folder's last modified date and time information. This complements existing FTP command MDTM ("Modification Time"), which "which was only intended to read the modification time and not to set it as some implementations do." 

Number 4, above, is critical: we have set KeepAlive in some other clients (e.g., CoreFTP LE) but we seem to have some routing equipment in the server environment which drops our connection when transferring a 7GB+ file. We have also set passive mode and "resume transfer" functionality seems currently broken with this secure file transport server...so we need to download the file in one go. What FTPS clients might meet our needs?

IBM Z/OS FTP SERVER PASSWORD RESET MECHANISM IBM z/OS FTP server extends File Transfer Protocol (FTP) command "PASS", to grant FTP users the ability to initiate the password change, via the FTP client. Specifically, enter "oldpass/newpass/newpass", in FTP client field "password" (substitute the actual old and new passwords, for "oldpass" and "newpass", respectively, preserving the forward-slash delimiters). Upon successful login, this triggers the FTP server to subsequently change the FTP user password, on the remote server. Subsequent logins require the FTP user to provide only the new password. Additional constraints exist; please refer to the IBM FTP command "PASS" documentation for full details. AUTOMATING IBM Z/OS PASSWORD RESETS Automation depends on both the FTP server password reset mechanism and an FTP client which lends itself to automation. We currently use Ipswitch WS_FTP Professional Client v12: 

Disable print spooler Restart machine Delete contents of: C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86 Enable print spooler and start service. Delete the network printer object and re-add network printer off of server. 

Placement of services is more of a thought exercise to come to your own conclusion. My guess based off of the number of printers and the number of servers, is that printing is a low priority service that only a few people manage. If that is the case, it really doesn't matter where you put it. Hope this helps 

So I am trying to get Remote Installation Service Running on a Windows Server 2003 R2 Standard Edition with Service Pack 2 installed. I am trying to integrate network drivers into the image and I keep getting this warning in the event log. 

[Background] We have been having trouble with our network clients suddenly being unable to print. They get an odd error with a hex code. We determined that something in the driver was messed up and we could resolve the issue by clearing the driver cache and reinstalling the driver. This happens to random computers every so often. We're assuming this is a bug with the latest Dell 2330dn driver since that is the only model that has this problem. [Problem] What we are looking to do is write a Powershell script that would clear the driver cache and redownload the driver. I see a ton of scripts out there to manage queues, servers, and ports, but nothing for local driver cache management. [Current Workaround] Since we have to do this manually, I'll write out the steps so you know what we want this script to replicate. 

From what little I know about WMI, this is created by the SCCM client, which makes a twisted kind of sense when you think about how SCCM works. I got this location from the "Deployment Monitoring Tool" that you can get in the System Center 2012 Configuration Manager Toolkit. If you look in the deployments area and the Enforcement tab, you can look at the DiscoverySourceXML to see what the detection returned. I just found this out today so I haven't been able to fully test it yet. This location could be just the results store for the application discovery process. So far, it's good enough to let me know what product codes work with the SCCM application evaluation process. I really need an SCCM developer to see this and set me straight. 

Adding your IP to hosts.allow should be fine. But. But as Zoredache mentioned tcpwrappers library is inserted voluntary "between the service and internet" see Wikipedia TCP Wrapper. It means that it is optional and not all services support it. Some will just ignore the configuration. For example services written by you. You should at least test each one used on your server. Firewall would be probably more trustworthy. 

If south and north are different IP networks, check routing table first. Than install wireshark on computer in question (or tshark if it is unix with shall only), one computer in north segment and one in south segment. Start monitoring network traffic and try connect to computer on north segment, save log. Monitor connection to south segment, save log. Monitor connection to internet, save log. Usually these things could happen: 1. you cannot see any outgoing packed - usually firewall related on local computer, check firewall 2. if packed goes out of problematic computer, you can see also arp request to destination IP if you see it also for IP from remote network, it is problem with routing table, if packet is routed correctly and still is not possible to deliver it, you should see ICMP packed with error explanation (in oposite direction) for example "host unreachable". 3. When you will compare traffic on source computer and destination one in south segment and you will see differencies, something disappeared in the middle. Check switches and wireless access points. If you has such possibility, than remove as much as possible devices between source and destination computer or change each device one by one and compare results. 

It's not clear why you are sure the problem is not caused by one of your endpoints (client or server), what type of traffic are you generating? Does it work with different device? 

Attempting to run Altera Quartus II (2) 9.0 on a remote RHEL5 Linux (2.6.18-308.1.1.el5 kernel 64-bit) box over a SSH connection via PuTTY 0.62 and a local Xming 6.9.0.31 X server running on Windows XP/Win7. I have set PuTTY up to forward X11 and successfully remotely run other X programs on this server. If I use Cygwin/X X server, Quartus II 9.0 displays correctly. Xming X server does not report any visible errors on the command line; it just seems to hang after displaying an initial blank, white box. Is this a known issue with Altera Quartus II 9.0 and Xming? Is it possible to know the root cause of the incompatibility?

After researching this issue, it appears no versions support FTP server command extension MFMT, as of the date of this answer. 

Hmm, from the founder of the company: "But they gave me something much more valuable, which was the computer time, and they also gave me the computer terminals. So that’s what put me in business. I got a little 1,000 square foot office in New York, and we divvyed up the $9,500 a month, $1,000 went for the rent. I went to a small space specialist. He specialized in under 5,000 feet. He got me this place, and they whitewashed it totally white. I mean lemon’s not going to do a whole lot for you. Today I can still look back on my starting point, that’s true. I was President so I took so much a month, and Peter took, and Marty took, and we had a sector, and we had two programmers part-time who ran the program for American Information Services. We labeled this program FOCUS. I guess it stood for online computer users, but we needed was an acronym that was easy to remember. So we gave it a computer type name, and FOCUS was our term for this non-procedural language. We got started about March 1, 1975. American Can gave us our first check and we set up shop." Link: $URL$
