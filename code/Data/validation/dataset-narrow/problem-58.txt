It is because you don't have any routes from the other AS in order for eBGP to be able to find a different interface. You will be given the directly connected interface, but the router would need to be manually configured to find a different interface in the router of the other AS. Your router and the router in the other AS must share a directly connected network. That network will automatically be in the routing tables of each of those two routers. Each of the routers has no other routes into the opposite AS. If you want to use loopbacks for eBGP, you would need to manually create static routes in each of the routers which point to the next hop. The routers already know how to find the next hop, so it is much easier to just use that for the neighbor relationship. 

Note: You really should have a firewall between the ISP and your switch stack. Also, you can't use NAT on the switch, you would need a router for that. 

To remove an address from a router interface, you use either use the form of the command in the interface configuration: 

If you are using Cisco switches, then you certainly cannot do NAT on them. Cisco claims NAT requires hardware assist, and it only provides that on routers. Also, when you NAT a source address, that sets the return traffic to that destination. If the traffic from Switch 2 gets a source address of Switch 1's loopback, any return traffic will be directed to Switch 1's loopback, and Switch 1 has no idea what to do with that traffic, so it gets dropped. It sounds like you want Switches 1 and 2 to share a NAT table, but it doesn't work that way. The translated traffic will need to be returned to the device that has the translation table in order to get a reverse translation and be sent back to the correct device. You also seem to be confusing the layer-2 (MAC) addressing with the layer-3 (IP) addressing. Layer-2 switches will switch traffic only based on the MAC address in the frame header; they do not look into the frame to even see the layer-3 address in the packet header. Routers will strip off the frame, losing the MAC address, in order to get to the layer-3 packet, and they make their routing decisions based on the layer-3 desitation address, creating a new frame for the new interface in the path toward the destination. Since you want to use NAT to change the source address, the destination host will use that address as the destination address for any return traffic, and a host on one network has no idea what the original layer-2 address was. 

I think you mean to ask when the switches have all converged. STP, including RSTP` is an ongoing process. BPDUs are being sent and received all the time. You will begin forwarding on G0/2 when it becomes a designated port at 12:25:27.173, and you will begin forwarding on G0/1 when it becomes a designated port at 12:25:27.182 None of that means the switches on the other end of those links aren't still blocking for a few more milliseconds, which appears to be the case for the switch connected to G0/2. Without looking at the other switches, you cannot tell when they have all converged, which may take just a little longer than S3. With what you have provided, you can't tell when they are all in agreement. 

TCP creates connections between the TCP peers. Each TCP peer creates a socket, which is identified by the TCP address (port) and IP address. The pair of sockets (one in each TCP peer) uniquely identifies the connection. To identify which TCP segments belong to which TCP connection, you need to identify the source and destination IP addresses and source and destination TCP addresses (ports). RFC 793, TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL explains this: 

DECT 6.0 is a standard, but many vendors' implementations are proprietary. See Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications: 

Or, you can do LAN routing on the switch if it is a layer-3 switch, but the Internet is routed on the router: Router configuration: 

Trying to compare the two protocols is really comparing apples and oranges. They are two separate protocols for two separate jobs. As Zac67 points out, LLDP is widely supported by business network devices, but it is limited to the link. It uses a layer-2 multicast address which will not be forwarded beyond the interface. DLEP is used between a router and modem to help the router make better routing decisions. It is not really a device discovery protocol the way LLDP is. I know that some Cisco devices support DLEP, but the RFC was only posted a few months ago, so it will be a while before it is widely supported. 

As the diagram shows, fragmentation happens along the path, as needed. It is up to the end-device to reassemble any fragments. Notice in the drawing how the colored boxes (representing IP packets) are fragmented by the first hop router, and they remain fragmented upon leaving the second hop router. Device B is responsible to reassemble the fragment into the IP packets before passing the reassembled packets to the upper-layer protocols. Note: This is only for IPv4. IPv6 requires the sending host to pre-fragment any IPv6 packets before sending them since the intermediate devices will not fragment the IPv6 packets. 

Also, many switches will now only do 802.1Q encapsulation, so the command to set the encapsulation is no longer needed or supported. It is only use on switches that can be set to different encapsulations.

Any routes redistributed into OSPF from EIGRP will be OSPF external routes. It is easy to redistribute only internal routes from OSPF into BGP: 

Edit: Based on the comments and discussion, it appears that you forget that you are asking about sliding windows, where the size of the window is adjusted to meet the network conditions. if the network conditions are so bad (you write, "extreme"), the window size will be very small. When it gets to the point of being so small that it is for a single segment, then there is no problem because any duplicate segments will be for a different window, and they will be dropped. 

If you are routing on your layer-3 switches, I would advise that you not use a VLAN as a point-to-point link between the switches. Treat these as a pair of routers: Switch 1: 

I think you are referring to the M and the O flags in the router advertisement. How host OSes interpret these flags is off-topic here. RFC 4861, Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6), Section 4.2. Router Advertisement Message Format details the Router Advertisement Message format, including the RA flags: 

Yes. Unfortunately such recommendations are explicitly off-topic here. Such a recommendation may become obsolete, and this site is meant as an archive. Also, specific IPv4 addresses will not work if you change to IPv6. 

Layer-2 protocols that use MAC addresses, where you have bridges, send frames directly to the MAC address of the destination host. The frames may pass through one or more bridges to get to the destination host. That is the case with ethernet switches or Infrastructure Wi-Fi WAPs. As Ron Trunk pointed out, frames will pass through a WAP in infrastructure mode, but the frames are addressed with the destination host's MAC address. 

A decent switch should solve your problem. If everything is on the same VLAN, the traffic from a PC doing a backup will not impede any other PC trying to send traffic through the router since the traffic destined for the NAS will not flow through the router unless they are on different VLANs. I assume they share a single VLAN based on your description of the low-end router. Adding an AP that connects to the switch will solve your Wi-Fi problem for all but the Wi-Fi devices. 

NAT is usually a one-way translation. You probably have one outside (public) IP address, and many inside (private) IP addresses. If traffic comes to your outside address, absent any other information, the NAT cannot determine to which inside address it should forward the traffic. For some things, you can set up port forwarding, e.g, you will forward any traffic destined to your outside address and port 80 to a web server. When a host inside your LAN initiates a connection to an outside host (e.g. your web browser wants to connect to a web server), it will use a random, ethereal port as the source port. For traffic to come back from the outside to this ethereal port, the NAT needs to record the port in its translation table. When traffic comes back from the outside host, destined for that ethereal port, the NAT knows to send it to the inside host address and ethereal port. This is port triggering. With NAT, you either need to manually configure port forwarding, or your NAT needs to do port triggering. Most NAT routers will automatically do port triggering without specific configuration. Some will let you change some parameters, e.g. how long it should keep the port triggering enabled without any traffic.
