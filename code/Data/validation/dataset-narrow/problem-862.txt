Short of a tool like SCCM you are not going to be able to discover an exact listing of machines on the network. First task will be finding the hosts: 

It might not be appropriate for your situation, but I got around having multiple contacts for the same person in Nagios by using distro groups. Instead of setting up an individual, I setup up groups in exchange. The Nagios contacts never change, but the distro groups fluctuate all the time. 

Get the Serial number for the server, find the manual online and see what the beeping could indicate. Look to see if there is a LED panel. Usually beepings are with LED alerts. Or any Hard Drives have Lights. 

Possibly look at having the cronjob output an error code to a log, ahve nagios look at the log. If the cronjob reports an error, than boom. Or, a little easier but less precise, have the last line of your cronjob script write to a log file. Have nagios check for the modification date of the log file. If it goes more than 25 hours, kick off an alret. 

My network Admin asked me if I had heard of any opensource competitor to Ciscoworks and Solarwinds for Network Administration/Management. We have a full implementation of Cacti and Nagios for monitoring, but I haven't really delved much into the realm of Cisco/Checkpoint/HP procurve management. Anyone use anything that fits the bill? 

We are currently having some issues transferring large files (100-800 GB) from one Windows 2003 server to another. They are all virtualized and on SAN partitions so we are trying to narrow down the gap between Networking, ESX, or SAN. Preliminary testing does not indicate Network performance, so we are moving on to testing write/read speeds of the SAN partitions by the OS. My question is this: 

If you alter a table to add an index, what could happen if that thread was killed during processing? Accroding to MySQL: 

It is possible to have hundreds of different websites all pointing to one database. You just need to make sure your host will allow your different domains/sites to connect to the same database. After all it's not the domain name that allows communication between the web and data tiers, it's the hosts server configuration and policies. For example I host one website, but have been thru 2 or 3 different domain names over the past few years. All of the domains point to the same website inside of IIS. Or in the case of one sub-domain points to a different website inside IIS, but still talks to the same database. It's al in your connection strings. However you will most likely not be able to have the database server on one host, and sites on a different host. These ports are normally shut down for standard communuication. Your best bet would be to talk to their technical support to see if it's allowed. 

I recently added a new modem (a plain ol consumer grade one) to a fax server thats been up and running for years running on Microsoft Server 2003 fax services. The server currently has two modems, the new one is identical to one of the existing. After installing the new modem it showed up in the Fax Server Manager as a device but was not doing outbound faxes. (The server by default does not handle incoming.) So after a reboot the server no loger sees the modem in the Fax Server Manager but is listed as a device in device manager. I've attempted to restart just the fax service and even the whole box again but to no avail. Any one have any ideas on this one? Or any one with good links to resources for the fax service? 

After saying all this, and realizing that IceMage said most of this as well... know that if the server is still working, it probably is just in a degraded state. Open a ticket or Email your server support team so it is documented, then personally talk to the Server Admin. 

This question really depends upon the individuality of your hosts. If you can get all of our hosts to a nice little standard, you can really work some magic with templates. Personally I find that it works for only the very basics (for example, Mem/Proc/Services on windows) Then it starts getting harder (one server has a File system that needs to have alerts sent to a production support group for space size violations, but it also has other File Systems that need to go to the development support group. And oh by the way, this server has unique drives because it was bought on a golf and shop trip by your boss) Personally I used a combination of Nagios 2.0 and 3.0, with a mix of Host groups. I separate hosts out into OS grouped configs (windows with windows, Solaris with Solaris, Linux with Linux). Then I break out the core checks into a core_checks.cfg (Memory, Processor, essential process checks) then I break the services that I monitor down into different config files (Oracle Database checks, My Sql Datbase checks, Very Specific File system checks, Website checks). This lets me have my config files organized logically for myself and anyone who comes after me. Note I do have 4400 checks these days so this might be overkill for other people. In the long run, I have a structure something like this nagios\etc\core_checks.cfg nagios\etc\hosts\windows_servers.cfg,solaris_servers.cfg nagios\etc\services\oracle_databases.cfg,MSSQL_databases.cfg 

For some reason 'network discovery' was turned off in the server and wasn't able to turn that on. Did this solution from Microsoft support portal and everything is fine with the universe again. Solution from Microsoft support portal: 

Now the successfully finishes and new printers are displayed. The problem is I cannot remove the old printers, it is showing "Access denied, unable to remove device" even as local administrator. will update after fixing the last issue. 

Ran the command for central admin site which shows 'provisioning' for a second and then turn to 'disabled'. Got a folder named in numbers inside the virtual directory which I suspect is the central admin site root. Pointed the central admin site in IIS(which was showing '\' not found error previously) to that directory which resolved not found error. Now while browsing to the site, after entering the credentials it shows '404 NOT FOUND'. Lets agree on that I messed the central admin site and wants to recreate it. Is there a way to successfully recreate my central admin site without losing any data from the farm(only one server)? Tried to backup farm using SP shell which fails due to search service(which is not using) issue. 

While am pinging from workstation to the server it doesn't ping and showing . However when am pinging from server it works, and now if I am pinging from the workstation it also works. And this is only for few minutes; the workstation goes to the old state after a few sec. In short if I need connection to server I am required to first ping from the server to workstation. Connection between other devices in the network works fine. Firewalls are off, machines are in same network, workstation is not added to the domain. EDIT3: The server PC got another NIC and I enabled that. It's IP is . Now the connection is seamless to and its still the same with (the other NIC which is every other person in the network connected to). EDIT1: more details When I ping from the server to the workstation it is creating an arp cache entry in the workstation for the server. And can access the server from workstation. After couple of minutes the entry for the server gets deleted from the arp cache and now it is unreachable. The connection can only be restored when I ping from server to workstation. EDIT2: Workstation: windows 7 Ultimate ipconfig info: 

If your under windows you will need to edit the in your my.ini file. You can see the MySQL Ref Manual for help on this as well. 

I've been trying to really figure out what my IOPS are on my DB server array and see if it's just too much. The array is four 72.6gb 15k rpm drives in RAID 5. To calculate IOPS for RAID 5 the following formula is used: . The formula is from MSDN. I also want to calculate the Avg Queue Length but I'm not sure where they are getting the formula from, but i think it reads on that page as . To populate that formula I used the perfmon to gather the needed information. I came up with this, under normal production load: . Also the disk queue lengh of . So to the question, am I wrong in thinking this array has a very high disk IO? Edit I got the chance to review it again this morning under normal/high load. This time with even bigger numbers and IOPS in excess of 600 for about 5 minutes then it died down again. But I also took a look at the , , and . These number were taken when the reads/writes per sec were only 332.997/17.999 respectively. %Disk Time: 219.436 %Idle Time: 0.300 Avg Disk Queue Length: 2.194 Avg Disk sec/Transfer: 0.006 Pages/sec: 2927.802 % Processor Time: 21.877 Edit (again) Looks like I have that issue solved. Thanks for the help. Also for a pretty slick parser I found this: $URL$ It works pretty well for breaking down the data into something usable.
