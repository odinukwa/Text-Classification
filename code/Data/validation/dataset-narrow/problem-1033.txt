Doesn't Windows come with ftp? I found these instructions. You should do ftp releases.mozilla.org instead of the IP address they list though (they're listing ftp.mozilla.org which is for developers). 

I'm trying to figure out how to make a package of mine depend on anything that provides "java", but I'm not sure what to even look up. Apparently "yum provides" is a command for finding out which package contains a particular file, and "yum info" doesn't seem to have the information I want. Basically, my OS has a package called "java-1.6.0-openjdk", and my package requires some implementaiton of Java, but it would work perfectly fine on Oracle Java, or Java 7, so I won't want to be that specific about it. Is there a way to just depend on anything that provides Java? 

This describes how to set up compiz with windows previews, but they don't work when the window is minimized. 

I had a situation today where I restarted my computer and it said I needed to check the disk for consistancy. About 10 minutes later (at "1%" complete), I gave up and decided to let it run when I go home. For comparison, my home computer uses Ext4 for all of the partitions, and the disk checks (which run around once week) only take a couple seconds. I remember reading that having fast disk checks was a priority, but I don't know how they could do that. So, how does Ext4 do disk checks so fast? Is there some huge breakthrough in doing this after NTFS came out (~10 years ago)? Note: The NTFS disk is ~300 GB and the Ext4 disk is ~500 GB. Both are about half full. 

.app "files" are folders containing multiple files. What you're seeing are the files distributed with the program, not the source code. The best analogy I can think of is if Windows programs were distributed in .zip files and you just dropped them in C:\Program Files to install them instead of extracting them. (So the files you're seeing are the files you would see in that program's "Program Files\program name" folder on Windows) 

This is not related to the ID of the disk (the hardware) itself. TM keeps the FSEvents ID it used for the last backup in the "extended attribute" on the disk. Normally, all it takes to determine what has changed is to compare that value to the ID known by OS X. However, if for some reason the OS X FSEvents database can no longer be trusted, it creates a new one, which changes its unique UUID. TM checks to see if the FSEvents database can be used for a specific backup disk by comparing that unique UUID to the UUID that is stored with the backup, in . So after a new FSEvents database is created, these UUIDs no longer match and TM needs to compare the harddisk with the backup, or might need to create a full backup. 

Also, even if there's only a single ethernet connector, your modem might in fact also have a built-in router, which then gives you a home network that knows how to handle internet traffic for multiple computers. If so, then simply hooking up a switch (or even a old hub, if you can still find one) will do. On some devices, the USB connector is not even meant for internet access, but only for maintenance, or to hook up a printer or external hard disk. Note that you cannot damage your modem or computer by simply trying / experimenting. But then I suggest to first try both methods separately, just to make troubleshooting a bit easier. (I assume you will need to install some specific USB drivers to get the USB working.) (For an exact answer we need to know the exact type of Netgear equipment you're using.) 

Yes, right-clicks from the client are sent to the remote computer. (But something tells me you're having trouble with that? What does Ctrl-Click give you? Which VNC server are you using on the Windows machine? UltraVNC gives me no issues. Are you scaling the screen? Is everything else working fine?) 

(I redacted the URL, so this will now give you a redirect warning you'd not get with a proper URL.) This probably holds all kind of tracking info (and also the Google cookies are sent along with this POST), which might be blocked by a privacy-related plugin or virus scanner. So, disable those to find the cause. (Also, Google keeps changing the way they show the search results. You might even get the long link when copying it. Not today, for me, on the English google.com.) 

On Linux there's a filesystem called tmpfs, which is basically a RAM disk. As its name suggests, it's frequently used for , because that folder only contains files that don't need to persist on reboot. Live CDs use a RAM disk for their entire hard drive. 

Meebo can access Facebook. You can use it's "pop out" feature if you want each chat to have it's own window like a normal IM client. I don't see what's wrong with just using Pidgin though. 

If they are different speeds, you will be limited to the speed of the slowest one (or they may not work at all together). Other than that, I don't think so. (and even if you do run the new memory at a lower speed, you probably won't notice the difference) 

Are you sure you're in the correct web group? On Ubuntu this probably means running alternately, www might have incorrect permissions. Make sure it's set so that group members have read/write access: . 

Blocklists generally block IP addresses belonging to companies that try to either track bittorrent users or send them bad data. From what I've heard, they're useful as protection against tracking (and getting infringment letters), but the main reason to use a blocklist is that they generally speed up your downloads. The reason is that some companies run bittorrent clients with intentionally bad data and try to share it. Your client will automatically discard it, but it will slow you down. Your client will also eventually block them even without the blocklist, but it's faster to just block them from the start. EDIT: So here's an article about how blocklists are helpful as protection against tracking (TorrentFreak suggests that if you're not using a blocklist, you're being tracked). 

Another update: GNOME 3 supports window snapping out-of-the-box. It doesnâ€™t have a taskbar though, so there's no possibility for window previews. 

Install CD: These are not capable of running an OS, only installing it. Live CD: You can run an OS from these, or install the OS (generally) 

I'm writing a paper on how to use search engines (directed towards people who weren't raised by Google) and I'm having troubling thinking of examples of bad searches (that people actually do). The examples I have so far are when people do searches like "how do I fix my laptop" instead of "dv2125nr won't turn on" or "why doesn't windows work" instead of "windows error IRQ NOT LESS OR EQUAL". Any ideas? 

The above is a pretty standard way to load some external JavaScript each time it's clicked. That external script uses some personal ID to know to which email address to send the result. Today, that JavaScript does not look very harmful: it sends the HTML source code of the page you're viewing to the toread's servers, which will then send the email. So, the HTML source code will be known to toread, implying one should be careful using this for very personal sites. But: the external JavaScript could change. Worse: if the value of that personal id can easily be guessed, then spammers could send their page to random users of this service. But today, that personal ID is a 12 digits hexadecimal code, so I doubt it's just an incrementing number that anyone can randomly try. One cannot know if/when the external JavaScripts needs to be reloaded after something changed on the toread's servers. So, to answer your question: one should not use this service without getting the latest version of that external JavaScript. Hence, getting rid of the bookmarklet does not make a lot of sense either. Today, it does not look harmful though. 

Even worse, neither the greyed-out "Use Default: Always Ask" in the above screen capture, nor enabling "Tell you when a website asks to store data for offline use" in settings, Advanced, Network, have any effect to avoid storage: 

Is that a hexadecimal key, or a passphrase? When using a passphrase then, according to Choosing a password for networks that use Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): 

Is assume that the password is actually encrypted? I think it should be; I doubt you can simply put a human-readable password in that password file. If nginx expects encoded/encrypted passwords in that file, then it will never find a good match if the stored password is using another format. (To find a match, it will encode the password as typed in by the user, and compare that encoded input to the encoded password as known from the file.) And indeed, according to the documentation, Passwords must be encoded by function crypt(3). You can create the password file with the htpasswd program from Apache. This still does not explain the actual error message, but when the password file holds the human-readable passwords, then this will surely yield a or . One can also create such encoded password online, on various websites. 

I don't know how to do the snap effect.. EDIT: This describes a way to make Compiz do something Aero-snap-like. According to this: 

I was looking at System Monitor on Linux and noticed that Firefox is using 441 MB of memory, and several other applications are using 274, 257, 232, etc (adding up to over 3 GB of virtual memory). So I switch over to the Resources tab, and it says I'm using 462 MB of memory and not touching swap. I'm confused. What does the virtual memory amount mean then if the programs aren't actually using it. I was thinking maybe memory they've requested but aren't using, but how would the OS know that? I can't think of any "I might need this much memory in the future" function.. 

When you read a page from a disk, your operating system will load that data into memory, and leave it there until it has a better use for that memory. If you have sufficient memory, your OS will only read each page once, and then use it from memory from then on. The only reason the OS will do real disk IO is if it needs to read a page that's not already in memory, or if a page is written to (in which case, you presumably want it saved to the disk). One advantage of doing things this way is that you don't have to load the entire hard drive into memory, which is useful if it won't fit, and also means you don't waste time reading files that your applications don't need. Another advantage is that the cache can be discarded whenever the OS needs more memory (it's better to have your next disk read be slightly slower, than to have your programs crash because they're out of memory). Also, it's useful that users don't need to manually decide what should be in the ramdisk or not: Whatever you use most often will automatically be kept in main memory. If you have a lot of memory, but your applications aren't running as fast as you would expect, there's a good chance they're slower because they're running safely. For example, SQLite is orders of magnitude faster if you tell it not to wait for writes to complete, but your database will be completely broken if you don't shutdown cleanly. Also, is usually a ramdisk on Linux distros, because it's ok if that data gets lost. There's still some debate over whether that's a good idea though, because if too much data gets written to , you can run out of memory. 

Some more generic information for those getting to this question because of its title: Gmail is very special when it comes to IMAP. Gmail uses labels, not folders, and there is simply no one-to-one mapping to IMAP. For example: putting a message in the Trash actually kind of assigns the label "Deleted". When labeled as such, any other label for that same message no longer applies. Be sure to understand the implications of this. Like if you think you copied a message to some IMAP folder, then actually Gmail will only have assigned an additional label to the very same message. Now, if you've (wrongly) set up Mail to move deleted messages to the Trash, then after "deletion" of either of the two occurrences of that single message, the other is removed as well. To get the full picture when using IMAP for Gmail, I think one should unfortunately at least read all of the following from Google's help: 

What behaviour would you expect? Isn't that like Paste (Ctrl+V on Windows, hence Command-V on a Mac?) See also Apple's Switch 101: The former PC user's guide to getting the most out of your Mac. 

Here, Gmail added the header; I am not sure if all mail servers do that. But: the regular headers do not mention the true recipient at all, and are really just a copy of whatever you typed. And your email client typically only shows details from the message. For example, the bounce address ( and ) might be different from the displayed sender (), and both might be false. And the date is really just the date that the sender has set. Sometimes spam has a date in the future or past, in an attempt to get the message displayed on top of your screen even after new messages have arrived. 

Once set, that filter is active even after restarting Chrome. And indeed Incognito Mode keeps its own setting for that. 

I assume things will be different for an extra drive, but for files on your normal drive things are even worse than you describe. Maybe this should have been a comment, but I think an answer stands out better in case someone reads this in the future: Time Machine only keeps hourly backups for the last 24 hours, only all first daily backups for the last month, and only all first weekly backups until the disk is full. So, even before Time Machine runs out of disk space, if you run Time Machine hourly then files that did not exist on your Mac for more than a day might be deleted from your backup after a day. Or, when running daily, files that did not exist on your Mac for more than a week might be deleted after a week (or a month; I never tested that). For example:
