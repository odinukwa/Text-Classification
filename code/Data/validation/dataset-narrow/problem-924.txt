You have to change the boot loader configuration. That is probably Grub or Grub2. There is a kernel parameter with the device name, device ID, file system label or file system UUID. You have to change that to the new partition. On you have to change the entry in . 

An improved workaround: You can create a bootable CD image (or an additional disk which becomes the boot disk and which you remove afterwards) which does not mount the disk but starts sshd. A script on the host can connect via ssh and export the device file of the disk via sshfs. But I have to admit that I have never tried to access a device file via sshfs. If that is not possible then my next try was to map the device file to a regular file via e.g. FUSE. 

The error even occurs before Apache knows that someone wants to make contact to it... If you want to answer on that port then you are forced to get something running that understands SSL. If you don't want (or simply cannot) install a certificate on that host then I am afraid your options are quite limited as you probably do not have the possibility to modify Netfilter or to run other software which could forward connections. 

Found the solution: System -> Advanced -> Firewall and NAT -> Check Bypass firewall rules for traffic on the same interface. This solved my problem. 

I have pfSense with one LAN interface which is connected to a switch. All ports on this switch are part of the LAN (VLAN 10). I have access points which are also part of the LAN, they have a static IP in the LAN subnet which users can connect to. The default gateway of all users on the LAN and the AP's are 10.70.10.1 which is the LAN interface of the pfSense box. I have another router which is only used to connect to remote networks. This router has an IP address of 10.70.10.9 so is also sitting on the LAN network. I have a static route on pfSense to point to these remote networks which says any traffic with a destination address 10.50.0.0/16 should use the 10.70.10.9 router as the next hop however this isn't working. I believe the problem is that when trying to access the LAN devices from the remote network (10.50.0.0/16) the AP's are sending their return traffic to their default gateway first (10.70.10.1) which is the pfSense box. The pfSense box then sees the static route and knows it then needs to send the traffic to the router with IP 10.70.10.9 but I believe it won't route traffic out of the same interface it was received on. Is this the behavior of pfSense? If so is there anyway to change it, I have had a look online and through the menus but can't see anything. I know another option would be to put the router on separate L3 network for the PPP link but was hoping there was an easier solution. Thanks, Jack. 

I am running a process which will take several hours. I would like to disconnect from the server, but I do not want to lose the output to the screen. Is there a way to bring the process back to my screen after I disconnect? It's a Python script that is running, and it is on Red Hat 6.3 

I am using md5deep to try take a list of md5 hashes from a list of files (approximately 100,000 hashes) and I'm comparing them to the NSRL hash list (15gb text file). I'm trying to accomplish 1 thing: Output hashes from my 100,000 that do not match hasehs in the NSRL hash list. I am having trouble figuring out how to pass the 100,000 hashes in correctly. Here is what I have: 

So I have a Fiddler2 capture. In the capture, there was a file that was downloaded, file.dat. I am trying to extract the downloaded file from the capture. I can't seem to find any way to do that. Any ideas? 

md5.csv is just the hashes, separated by breaklines. Its not actually a csv. I could theoretically cat md5.csv and pipe each line into 

I have a script to show users which haven't logged in recently which uses the Get -ADUser command with a filter on 'LastLoginTimeStamp'. At the moment we disable accounts which haven't logged in for 90 days but I would like to take this a step further (as we are very limited on licenses) so that accounts without a license assigned are disabled after 30 days. If they already have a license assigned there isn't much point in disabling their account before that license expires. As the Microsoft policy states 'any user with the ability to RDP must have a license' we are finding our self in the position where we have users that are not using RDP that we would like to disable and move to a group which doesn't permit RDP so we can free up a license for a new user. I have came across multiple resources online which show how CSV reports can be produced but I can't find anything which shows how PowerShell can access this information. Is there a way or am I going to have to create a Powershell script to export a CSV license report and then another to compare the contents of that CSV to a list of users that haven't logged in within x days. I am not looking for someone to write a script for me but to confirm if there is a way of doing this within Powershell. Thanks, Jack. 

I am trying to establish an SFTP connection on an AS400, which is on an OS that is not running a Linux based kernel. Any idea where I can start with this? 

I have setup fail2ban to monitor a service which I have exposed outside my router. The files are being logged properly, and the events are being picked up by fail2ban 

I am trying to use SNMPSet to execute a command on a remote server. I'm not 100% sure this is possible. I've been researching this, but I cant find any way to do this. Any insight would be appreciated. 

Any ideas where to start? Edit: I enabled SSH in the jail.conf and it worked with no issue, so fail2ban and iptables appears to be working right, but service is not. 

When I installed OpenVAS, I was prompted for a password, however the prompt errored out. I have installed OpenVAS and it is working properly, however I cant get in as admin (I created a new user and that works fine). I've tried googling how to reset admin password, recover admin password, change the access of a user to admin, but to no avail. Greenbone Security Assistant is version 4.0. OpenVAS is version 6 I believe (I just installed it today) Host OS is Kali Linux.
