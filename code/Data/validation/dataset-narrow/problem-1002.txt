After a very long time on the phone to Microsoft Support, it seemed to be the case that this happens either: 

There's no clue at all about what required file is missing, or what installation source is unreachable. The only actions are, a link to a completely generic installation help page with no relevant info, and a "Close" button. The closest to Microsoft support on this error is a page for every error code between 3 and 4 saying it might be related to my connection. I've disabled my firewall and tried on multiple connections, but nothing works. I had a trial version of Office 2016 installed, but it still happens even after completely uninstalling the trial and using Microsoft tools to ensure there's no trace left. There's nothing wrong with my network connection. I've tried restarting and running the installation with no Office software open. How can I go about fixing this? I'm all out of leads. 

There are two types of Office365 Business admin page. If you're both an account administrator and a user, it can get a little confusing: 

It appears that the Office 2016 "Metered connection" feature works by imitating a setting of 0 on this registry entry. Before Office 2016, this would have been a registry setting set by an administrator, and it seems like they didn't update the UI message to check it's not appearing for administrator-unrelated reasons. 

(Curiously, when is ticked, I get very strange find behaviour if any code is folded: it struggles to find anything at all, folded or unfolded, even when everything is selected. I'm not sure if this is related or not: I suspect it's a bug unrelated to my question, but it might be a sign I've misunderstood something about how Find works when some code is folded. My expectation was that Find In Selection wouldn't change its behaviour when some code is folded) 

Many online resources for this issue in Office 2013 (example) suggest editing the registry entry , which has the following values: 

I set up an Office 2016 Business subscription about a year ago. At the time I only needed it on one PC; now it'd be useful to have it on two. I don't remember how many installs my account was allowed and I'm finding it hard to find out how many my subscription is allowed. For example: 

Much trial and error later I have it most (but not all) of the time. If anyone can piece together a more coherent explanation, please do post it and I'll accept it. This isn't helped by the fact there are a myriad of different versions and makes of all the software here... for me I think the important steps were: 

I know lots of techniques to remove trailing spaces from cells in Excel (e.g. ), but sometimes I get given large sheets from other people which contain trailing spaces in dangerous places, where it's not obvious there's a problem because the trailing spaces exist in multiple places (so lookups etc still work) - but those trailing spaces cause unexpected problems later. In Word and various publishing applications, there are options to show invisible characters. For example, in Word, it's called "Show non-printing characters", and it looks like this: 

I just found out that Brackets is partly supported by Adobe and so you can get some more relevant results by searching for in quotes. Using this, I found this issue which seems to suggest that jumping to matching bracket has been an open "to do" since Oct 2013 and (as of August 2014) hasn't been implemented yet. 

Update - I don't think this below is a solution, I think it might have been coincidence that Bluetooth came back after I did this. Leaving it here as something that might sometimes work and an example of something I've tried. As stated in the update to the question, bluetooth comes and goes. This seemed to help one time when it had gone for hours and nothing else seemed to work, but the problem repeats. 

This is impossible because I have an online subscription which doesn't come with a product key. I am the administrator, and I created no such policy. What could have caused this and how can I make it allow me to log in? I've found lots of resources on this for Office 2013, but nothing for Office 2016. 

Apparently this is some hot new feature Firefox introduced in 2013. I found a thread discussing it, where a lot of Firefox users seem to be unimpressed. So it turns out there's a setting in Windows designed to stop text getting too small on high-resolution devices. You can find it by searching for "text size" in control panel. 

The latest version of Illustrator (CC) is effectively version 17 - you're likely to have trouble getting version 9 working on a modern machine. Illustrator 9 was released in 2000 for Windows 98. A decent Illustrator alternative that is free and open source is Inkscape. It's improving fast (e.g. it's finally starting to get good CMYK support, though some workarounds are still needed), it's better than it looks, and while it's not as good as Illustrator 14+ (CS4+), I'd choose it over version 9. Adapting to Inkscape is probably easier than trying to make Windows 98 software run on Windows 8. 

Is there a way to jump to the matching brace / bracket in the text editor Brackets aka Brackets.io? Brackets definitely does match braces - it highlights matches - but I can't find any feature to jump to the match, in menus or docs. In Sublime Text the keyboard shortcut for this is . 

As I understand it, "Windows 8.1 Pro" is essentially "Windows 8.1" [non-pro] but with the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack installed, which adds security features among other things. Can a buyer assume that any Windows 8.1 machine is technically capable of being upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro, or do they need to ask the vendor any time they want to buy a Windows 8.1 machine then upgrade it to Windows 8.1 Pro? There are no system requirements for the Windows 8.1 Pro Pack overall separately to Windows 8.1, but a few individual Pro features do have specific requirements. I don't mind if a few niche features might not be available, what I'm mostly interested in is, if a standard company network requires Windows 8.1 Pro for domain binding, will any machine that runs Windows 8.1 be capable of being upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro and using Windows 8.1 Pro's domain and network features? Here are the Pro features with specific requirements. 

I'm looking for a simple versatile formula that allows simple mathematics to be done to column positions, returning the appropriate column letter code. For example: 

Sometimes, after a long time of failing, the Metro-style Bluetooth settings screen appears looking like this, with a never-ending working indicator and no clue what it's trying to do. Note that the 'metered connection' thing is almost certainly a red herring, it doesn't try to do any setup when I'm not on a metered connection. I'm also almost always on a metered connection and it doesn't usually complain. 

Clicking that "Download" button with nothing selected simply downloads everything, as one zip file. Or you can select and download individual folders. Nice! The only downside I noticed in switching from Google Drive to OneDrive is, OneDrive's web view doesn't (currently) have a handy "Upload folders" option, like Google's. If you're using the web view, you have to create the folders manually, then select all in your folder and upload the contents. It's not too bad though, 5 clicks instead of 1. There's one other big advantage to OneDrive from a content creator's point of view: you can chose a sort order, including manual sort, and save it to be the folder's default sort order for people viewing it. Viewing users can choose and save a different sort order for themselves, if they want, but you can control the default order. 

I can't find any way to do this remotely accurately. Best seems to be adding an animation from the start positions (for example, for shape A, doubling to size 200x200 and moving to A-(C-A):B-(D-B), trusting that this will land in more or less the right position - but instead of starting from C:D, it jumps back to A:B. I can't even find a way to input the numbers for the move, so even if I could get it to start at C:D, I'd be relying on trial and error dragging the path into a guessed position. I've seen some suggestions to create a second slide, that starts in the new positions, and create new animations going back to the old states, but I can't even find any way to create a slide based on an animation's end points. How can I do this? Powerpoint 2016 if that's relevant. 

Also, I can save new files to the pen drive, but the command line resists ing to it. Here's some testing after creating a directory called - when I to a valid location, it just silently bounces off, when I to an invalid location, it tells me: 

This makes no sense because Bluetooth on this device is internal, it can't be unplugged. The problem is exactly the same if I start up while charging, so it's not an energy saving issue. It stopped working while the device was unplugged, and the device was a normal temperature, so the internal Bluetooth adapter can't have been fried by a power surge or overheating. Before just now, Bluetooth had worked fine for months - although in the last week or two, there has been a couple of times when the Bluetooth keyboard stopped working for about 10 seconds then started working again. No updates have been applied recently, and no new software installed. I can't find anything Bluetooth related in Device Manager to check the drivers (but to be honest I'm not 100% sure where to look). While trying to research this I found a MS answer that prompted me to look at what Bluetooth items I have in Control Panel, I'm not sure if this below is normal or not (I can't see "Bluetooth devices"): 

Based partly on this which has a handy formula for transposing to get a column of column letters, incremented each row. 

I drafted a detailed email in Outlook 2016 last night while I had no internet access. I closed down as usual, expecting to send the email from my drafts folder the next day. My Outlook has two accounts, an Exchange account which is the one I was writing the email as, and an SMTP/IMAP account. This morning, with internet access, on Outlook on the same computer, my draft email has gone. I can't find it in either drafts folder. It seems like Outlook might have looked at my online drafts folders, synced them, and deleted the local one I wrote last night. Is there any way I can retrieve this draft email? 

This jumps the window around between different pre-set screen positions (up fills the screen, left fills left half of screen, right fills right half, etc). You may need to repeat, mix or cycle through different arrow key presses to convince Word to put the doc on the actual screen not whatever non-existent non-screen it thinks the document is on. 

That's it - the image should be re-inserted in the correct place. If it needs to go via Outlook for Mac, email it to your Outlook for Mac account, then forward. 

2016 update . This still isn't possible in Google Drive, and, judging by the frosty response from Google when asked about it, it seems to be by design. It honestly looks like if you're sharing with friends, family or colleagues who might not have Google accounts, Google wants the user experience to be bad. If you're the person receiving the shared folder, you're stuck. Google says no. Since the question is from the point of view of the person creating the shared folder, there are two workarounds I'm aware of: 

Also, I put Lodbak.gen!lnk and Autorun.gen in the title because I believe it's one of those which is the specific one that created the drive-within-a-drive - probably Lodbak judging from the description - but I could be wrong. Please correct if I am. 

I've never heard of that file before. Searching around on bing it looks like it might be associated with some plugin for MS Word that is in some way associated with QuickBooks (QuickParts?), but there's not much clear information. This also seems strange since a) I wasn't opening Word (the only software I had opened at the time was Outlook) and b) I've never used QuickBooks or anything related to it, and it doesn't even seem to be available to my network profile (I'm not even aware that anyone in our organisation uses it, althoug it's possible). So,
