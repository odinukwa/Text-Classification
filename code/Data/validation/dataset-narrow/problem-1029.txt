Core Question How can I ensure that my GeForce GTS 450 is working properly? Background: I have an AlienWare system with dual GeForce GTS 450 in SLI running Windows 7 SP1. Shortly after I got it, I installed the Folding @ Home GPU client and that seemed to work quite well. Later, I ran into issues and reformatted the harddrive and reinstalled all the software piece by piece rather than using the straight "Factory Restore" option. This let me avoid many of the trial programs and other programs that came with it that I never used. The system works quite nicely, except that the Folding @ Home GPU client will not process anything other than its test unit and gives messages about the core not being available. I tried the non-GPU F@H client and that seems to work. The only game I play currently is SW:TOR but that seems to work without problems. I would like to get the F@H working to contribute again, but my main concern is making certain that my video cards are working properly. 

I agree with mgjk but to expand on it a little, USB harddrives are relatively reliable. I have had some last for several years. I have had some fail on me, but then that is true of the primary harddrive inside the computer too. Any harddrive, indeed any storage medium at all, will have a failure rate. That is why for files that are truly valuable you should have redundant backups, no one solution will be perfectly reliable. At home I backup my files automatically to my NAS as well as using dropbox for many of my key files (in conjunction with truecrypt for the sensitive ones.) I also occassionally burn a DVD with the files that I know I want to archive for the long term. I would not fully trust any single one of those solutions, but together I know the odds of them all failing at once are acceptably low. 

Yes, your modem seems to be a router as well. If you look at the IP address assigned to your router, if it's not your public IP address, (such as: , , or ), then you can simply hook you other router into one of the other ports and you'll be good to go without any further setup. If it is a public IP address, then you may need to get a second IP address from your ISP to allow traffic from both routers at the same time; however do keep in mind that most ISPs will charge you for more than one public IP address. 

The way Windows installs itself, not really. If you have a separate hard drive, then yes installing on the separate drive can greatly increase performance. 

Take a thermometer and measure the outgoing air of the laptop, if it's different than the temperature readings in your software/BIOS, then it's possible that the temperature sensors on the motherboard are bad. If they are bad, you can try and set your BIOS so that it doesn't shutdown the system for another 20Â°C, if you do that though, I highly recommend keeping an external thermometer on the laptop's air outtake so that you can manually keep an eye on it. 

What are others seeing? Update: For W500 owners w/ the 9 cell battery, what value do you see for "Full charge capacity" when on the Battery tab of the Power Manager utility? I see 81.87 Wh. 

I'm looking to simultaneously send the same email to multiple recipients. Let's say I want to email John and Bill the same email, I want them to be in the "To:" field, but I don't want them to see each other in the address list. I don't want to bcc them both because then they see they are bcc'd. I want them to each get their own copy of the identical email and to have 2 emails in my sent folder - one for each of them. Essentially I want the same result as if I separately sent them each the identical email, but I'd like to do it in fewer steps. Can I accomplish this either natively or with a plug-in, or some pre-existing code? NOTE: I am looking to do this interactively (in real time), not in batch. 

Move cursor to an arbitrary location Pause momentarily, taking hand off the trackpad If I try to move the cursor specifically in the down direction, it sticks. Other directions ok. 

I contacted LogMeIn customer service and was surprised to find out that LogMeIn Free is indeed licensed for corporate use. Of course has the limited feature set which could limit its usefulness in a company environment but if all you need are the basics then you're all good. 

I have only done this once before with Windows 7, but many times with Vista and XP. Generally with all of them, moving to a new physical system requires a little work, but it is quite manageable normally. As a general rule, I reinstall windows on top of itself. This preserves your data and most installed programs while reconfiguring the registry and getting the proper drivers installed. I have known people to move harddrives and just install the appropriate drivers without reinstalling windows, and this has worked in some cases, but overinstalling windows normally gives cleaner results. The one case where I would expect significant problems, that I have never personally tried, is moving from a 32 bit system to a 64 bit system. As with all major changes, you probably want to make a thorough backup of the data before making the change (or better, just double check the automated backups you already have....) 

Is there some way to add files to an encrypted archive without providing the password for that archive? For example, if you are using dropbox which has a TrueCrypt encrypted file on it, it is easy to use TrueCrypt in portable mode to mount that file and then add to it. But if you are working on a computer that is not fully trusted, that involves not just entering the password but actually permitting that computer at least temporary access to the unencrypted archive. That may not be desirable, but you may need to add files to that archive from the not fully trusted computer. My suspicion is that not only is there no current way to do this, but that there can be no way of doing it, but I would like to know if I am missing something. 

I cringed at this a little. You didn't do port forwarding, you put your computer in the DMZ, (De-Militarized Zone). Basically ALL traffic is able to to hit your computer when you're on Ethernet. GET OFF ETHERNET RIGHT NOW!!! Posting to get the last bit out to you, more to come. Edit: In an nutshell, try to undo everything you did to get things back the way they were. Disable DMZ and any port forwarding you did and see if you get a 192.168.X.X address again. 

Pretty much they're going to do exactly what you're thinking. Twitter and other social media websites get more hits from people if they randomly spam them like crazy. My mother did that non-sense and I got spam from Facebook like crazy telling me to join as if it were her. While they might currently say that you will get control over what happens to your contact information, they also say that they can change their Terms Of Service (TOS) at any time they choose. Personally, I see no point in trusting them in what they say. If you have a large amount of people that you need to add to your Twitter contact list, it would be best to add them one at a time to avoid any potential issues that Twitter might have. There's also the small little detail of the possibility that they might get hacked in the future, and if your credentials are there, (potentially in plain text), then you're more than likely going to get your email hacked as well. Mind you, if you keep the same credentials for both Twitter and your email you may get hacked anyways due to your bad password decisions. 

When taking notes with a stylus on a capacitive touch device like the ipad or android tablets how do you prevent your hand from causing multi-touch problems? When you write, both the stylus and your hand are touching the screen. Does the presence of your hand screw up your touch entry just as accidentally placing a second finger on the screen at the wrong time would? 

The site's logon process is distributed between multiple pages so I need to be able to start the session manually with my web browser, authenticate, then launch the spider and give it access to the cookies. Many of the links execute Javascript and then return content. Many of the links return PDF documents (some spiders do support this). 

Is there a way to prime Outlook's local address cache with names/email addresses from the local address book? It's a real hassle when, for example, you move a user from another email client to Outlook and they have to either type in or look up the recipient's name the first time they email that person. It's so time consuming. Update: Is the process different for Exchange mailboxes vs. IMAP? 

What happens is this: if, prior to activating the hotkey there is any arbitrary window in focus, the browser instance launches in the background which is not what I want. If however the desktop or Taskbar has focus then my new Chrome window comes to the forefront as I want it to. 

I believe that you can install POV outside of the Program Files* directories, so you can install the program in: and it should work, (any directory in your user profile should work as well, but I recommend installing it into its own folder to prevent issues with other programs). Really, any folder that you can create folders and files in will work as well. As for the files locked in the Administrator's folder, why not just copy the files into your home folder while logged in as an administrator and then grant yourself full access to the files? I haven't installed POV-Ray in a while, but running the installer gives me the option to change the install path, so I'm pretty sure at least one of the above methods will work for you. Currently I don't need it; so I'm not going to fully install it. 

If any admin account has been compromised on your system, (Windows, Linux, Mac, *BSD), then the entire system is pretty much compromised, unless the malware is incredibly poorly written. Admin accounts tend to have full access to all of the system's resources and can make any changes they want. This is why you should always be using a non-administrative account for day to day usage. If you're only using a regular account, the amount of damage is typically limited to just your account and anything you've been granted access to. Mind you, some malware is capable of gaining administrative privileges on a regular account; but those are due to flaws in the OS, or perhaps a service running in the background. 

Under the above conditions, I clocked under 2 hours of battery life across 3 tests (1:49, 1:52, 1:47). If I actually use the computer, we're looking at 1:30. Something is not right... 

I want to remove the folder, so I read How to Remove RSS Support from Outlook and discovered the MFCMapi gem of a utility. I followed the instructions in the section "Delete the RSS folder using MFCMAPI" section, and was able to remove the folder from Outlook. However, the "RSS Feeds" folder now shows in the "Deleted Items" folder in Outlook Web Access (OWA) and also on my mobile devices, but not in Outlook. In OWA I attempted a right-click and delete, but I am told that folder cannot be deleted. I poked around my OST file (I am running in cached exchange mode) using again using MFCMapi to see if I could find the folder but I do not see it. Finally I created a new Outlook profile in which I do not cache messages, so I could get a "live" look at the server and attempt to see the folder and delete it that way, but it still did not show. Any ideas? 

Instapaper looks interesting because it does page clean-up, but it's not clear to me that it actually stores the page content or is full text searchable. In addition, they state in their FAQ that their storage isn't mean to be long term. Thoughts on addressing the gaps and improving this process further?
