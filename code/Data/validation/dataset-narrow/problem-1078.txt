Loans where payments are made at the beginning of the month (value 1), Loans where payments are made at the end of the month (value 0). 

The number formatting doesn't need conditional formatting, you can simply select the two columns and format as appropriate. 

Actually, I think that the simplest way is to use the Find & Replace on the column concerned if you intend to delete the original later on. 

This formula also works: You only need to rename the column headings and after removing the formulae in the cells through Copy/Paste Values, you can delete columns A and B. 

You can copy and paste the list from Sheet1 into Sheet3, then copy the list in Sheet2 into Shett3, just below the last value you pasted a bit earlier. After that select the column and go to 'Data' > 'Remove duplicates'. This should give you the list you are looking for. 

Then, you can Copy/Paste (Paste values and format the date) the information you need into a new sheet, where you will move the date column to the right. Insert two columns between the Max ID and the Date, then do a simple concatenate: 

This function makes sure that the line with is also empty. If you don't mind having it also copied, then you can use this shorter one: 

Download the 32bit version of windows as ISO file and use WinToUSB to install the ISO on your hard drive whilst it's mounted on another computer. Demo of WinToUSB Here 

The answer to your question is that it is not possible to perform that action within Windows 10 using the standard software you have mentioned. That doesn't mean you cannot work around it though. To go to the end or beginning of a line your 'Go To' keys would be 'Home' and 'End'. If you prefer to remap Home/End to function with your Arrow keys then this is possible by writing a simple script using AutoHotKey. You could make an extremely simple script where if you press Ctrl + Up Arrow it will do 'Home'. Or if you press Ctrl + Down Arrow it will do 'End'. Example Script 1: ^Up:: Send, {Home} Example Script 2: ^Down:: Send, {End} 

Try holding down the power button for a long period of time until you hear a loud long beep come from the machine. This will force machine to 'hard' boot up and perform hardware checks as it does so. 

The answer to your question is that unfortunately this is not possible in Firefox. There are however some other distributions of Firefox such as WaterFox, PaleMoon and a few others. Some are tailored towards privacy and others towards added functionality and optimisation. Have a read here to see what the alternatives are. You may have better luck using a different browser but you cannot do what you're trying to do using Firefox itself. 

I tried them, PatchFor4GB adds a boot option to the bootloader list, which is supposed to be the kernel-patched one, but everytime I boot with it, I only get a blank screen on my computer after the Windows logo splash and then it gets stuck there. With PatchPae, the added loader option just didn't boot the system at all. However, I also tried this in an installation of a Virtual Machine of the same system, assigning it 6GB of RAM and the patches worked like a charm. Because I use with my computer some hardware that uses privative drivers made ONLY for 32bit systems, I CANNOT INSTALL THE 64-BIT VERSION OF WINDOWS (they're a bit old, trust me, they don't work in Windows 64-bit). Please eliminate that as a possible answer. Sorry. Do you know any reliable way to make my Windows 7 Ultimate able to use the total of the RAM my computer has installed? Any graphic or command-line solution is more than welcome and appreciated :D UPDATE: I forgot to mention that in both of the cases I mentioned, if I boot in Safe Mode (with or without networking/command prompt), I can reach to the graphic interface. Thanks in advance!! 

The answer to your question is that it is not possible to blur footage with the default set of Windows 7 apps. 'Windows Movie Maker' used to be the go to free software for basic editing but it's now only downloadable from Microsoft and isn't actually 'free' for all intensive purposes. Your solution is here: Download 'Shotcut' video editor for free here. Follow the instructional video on how to blur parts of an image using Shotcut Here 

The solution to your problem is to use the 'ImageSearch' function. If you hit print screen button whenever those popups occur, you can then CRTL+V paste it into paint. Then, crop the image so that all you have is your popup window and save it as .bmp file. You can then use this bitmap file within your ImageSearch code. A quick look at someone's ImageSearch code can be found here. So if your script finds the image it's looking for you can outline further code to run under 'ErrorLevel = 0' If your script cannot find the image you can outline different code to run under 'ErrorLevel = 1' it's advisable that at this point you start labelling your sections of code and making use of 'Gosub' so your code can jump between routines when it hits different 'if' variables. This way you don't need to create a giant script repeating yourself too much. Also be aware that ImageSearch will not function properly when your script is transferred from one machine to another if the screen resolution is even slightly different. If you try to run your code on a machine that has a different screen resolution, you will have to screenshot your popups again for it to work. Example: 

Replace with the reference to the cell where you are putting the value. If you have a table to fill, it'll be easier if you lock some addresses and drag the formula: 

Scroll until column C is the first column you can see and put 1 in the range. You should see this (or something similar I believe): 

You can use this little customized "application" in excel. You only have to make a few changes and change the number of rows for the number of years of payments: 

This will give the number of times appear in column A. So, if you want to add in those that contain as well, just add another : 

It's very similar in selecting to paint.net, but you can also change the area of the selection after selecting it the first time --maybe to make fine adjustments-- by clicking and dragging your mouse over the squares appearing when you hover your mouse over the vertices or rectangles when it's over the edges of the square guide: 

Go to the "Developer" tab > "Visual Basic" Right click on "ThisWorkbook" on the right pane and look for "Insert" > "Module" In the text box which will open in the big left area, put the code. Do "File" > "Export" and give a name to the module so that other users can import the code and not do this all over again. Make sure the extension '.bas' is there (I'm not familiar with vba yet, but so far, '.bas' has done what I wanted it to do). To import a module, do "File" > "Import" and browse for the module. Almost there! Make sure the cursor is somewhere within the block and then click the little green "Play" button above the text box. I don't know why you have to do it each time, and I don't know how to resolve that as of now, sorry! 

If the computer you're logging into has 2 monitors then just log into the computer with Tight VNC two times and have the scroller bar for each VNC window positioned how you prefer. 

Sounds like the solution to your problem is AutoHotKey. You can write a simple script that remaps any key combo of your choosing to any key on your keyboard. So if ALT+Numpad2 interferes with a preset shortcut in firefox, you can change it so that instead Shift+Numpad2 performs your desired action instead. 

MPEG Streamclip can merge all chapters in a loaded DVD and export it to MOV/MP4 file. It is free and is still widely used within the video post production industry so you can trust it to be a good shot at trying to rip your DVD. After your DVD is inserted, simply click on 'File > Open DVD' and you will be given options if you want to export specific chapters or the whole thing. It can also load individual VOB files for conversion if you wish. You won't be able to output to MKV but you can still make a high quality MOV out of it and then convert that to MKV if you need. 

I just installed Windows 7 Ultimate x86 (32-bit) on a computer with 16GB of RAM, so naturally it won't use all the available memory because my system is 32-bit. I searched for a solution and found about patching the kernel with PAE. I found a couple packages that are meant for this task: 

I frequently run into the issue that I need to perform fresh installations of Windows, mostly Windows 7, but it's kinda tedious to also install some "common software" every time I install the OS. By "common software" I mean programs that I need to install on every computer that I install Windows on, like office suites, graphic design software, media players, typographic files, desktop tweaks, etc. I've seen that at some places, custom Windows images are offered with some tweaks included (even already activated). Is there a way that I can burn a "snapshot" of an already existing installation to a disc so that I can install it on another computer and that this new installation already has the aforementioned software installed in it (as it is in the original installation)? Thanks! 

So here is what happened: I have a Windows installation in my HDD. I was trying to install Ubuntu from a USB drive, it showed up when I pressed F10 (key in this computer to select the device to boot from) but it wouldn't boot from the USB just like that, so I entered into the BIOS settings and in the tab I read on the right that by disabling legacy USB is supported, so I disabled it, saved and reset. But it wouldn't boot anyway, I played around with some settings but nothing had changed to this point... even though I couldn't boot from USB, my Windows was still booting from my HDD. But in one of those times I was changing settings, I mispressed F9 (loads optimised defaults) instead of F10 and hit enter, and from here I can't see ANY bootable devices under the tab and now I can't even boot Windows anymore, as well not from my USB either. When I power on my laptop, it just shows the Samsung splash and it enters in the settings page by itself. Can anyone please help me get my bootable devices found by the BIOS again? Thanks in advance!! Here is my current BIOS settings: 

The solution to your problem is AutoHotkey With it you can write a script that does all the hard work for you. Mapping the actions required to 'right-click > copy link address' to a single key on the keyboard. To right-click with the keyboard you must press Shift+F10. This keyboard shortcut does not interfere with any default chrome shortcuts so you're safe to use it within your script. The following script will copy link address automatically when you click your media file and press F1 on your keyboard (you're free to change it to any key you like) Step 1 - Download and install AutoHotKey Step 2 - Right click on your desktop > New AutoHotKey script Step 3 - Open the AHK file in Notepad and paste in the following script: 

Every single command in your autohotkey script can have as much delay as you want using the 'Sleep' command between lines. So 'Sleep, 1000' would instruct the script to not do anything for 1 second before moving onto the next command in the script. 

AutoHotKey is the answer to your problem. With it you can create a script to automate your mouse and keyboard movements. You can have all of your URLs on a spreadsheet, and have AutoHotKey copy/paste the URLs into the address bar for you. You can even program it to do an 'image search' between every URL and perform a further action based on the results it finds. So if the web result says 'You Have Been Pwned!' you can have AutoHotKey detect that image on the screen (using the image_search function), go back to your spreadsheet, highlight the cell red, and then move onto the next URL. A piece of software that will prove itself very powerful for your purposes. You just need to do some minor research to understand the basic commands required to make the script work. So the workflow would be the following:
