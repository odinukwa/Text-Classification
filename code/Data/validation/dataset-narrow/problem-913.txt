Please check if the scripts and the directory can be read and executed by the webserverÂ· I'm assuming you're using a lamp system. check if the permissions for the directory and scripts are set to r-x for everyone. 

You can't run a batch script hidden if run it like this. But it's possible with a little VBS. Just execute the VBS file and it will run the Script hidden 

The encrypted file must be opened by the same user which created it. The encrypted file must be opened on the same computer on which it was created. 

It's not possible to get this kind of information with vdf. You can use esxcfg-scsidevs to get thiss kind of information assuming you're running ESX 4.0. on ex 3.x you can try to achieve something similir with esxcfg-vmhbadevs. First get a list of all VMFS volumes with their idenfitifer 

No there is no (easy) way to stop the password from being viewed but that's not as bad as it looks. The decryption only works under the following circumstances: 

No your connection on the virtual Windows XP machine will not be directly available on the phyiscal Ubuntu installation. The host system (phyisical machine which is running the virtual machines) does not have access to the network connections of a VM. 

Now you can check if the VMFS Volumes are local disks or if they are SAN or iSCSI disks. I'm not sure if you see iSCSI information with the command. I'm only using local and SAN Volumes. 

Hm the role management tool only exists on Windows Server 2008. It's the replacement of Add / Remove Windows Components of the Windows Server 2003. Is it possible that you need at least SP2 on your windows server 2003? Or try to install the newest .Net Framework 2.0 Release prior to install the 3.5 release. Maybe you will find some usefull information in the 3.5 Readme: readme 

I'm not sure if you can use mass vhosts (apache2). i've never done something like this before. $URL$ What exactly do you want to achieve with this solution? 

Is JavaScript allowed in your firefox installation? (Tools->Options...->Content) Did you also try to clear the cache and cookies of your Firefox installation? You can empty it with Ctrl+Shift+Delete. 

After debugging this issue for nearly a week we've installed the newest NIC drivers. Unfortunately this didn't really help either so a Windows Repair from the Windows Server 2003 SP1 installation CD was executed and the Service Pack 2 installed again. And suddenly it works ;-) I'm pretty sure that some dll's were corrupted. 

We've just switched to Sophos Endpoint Security. $URL$ you will get a very good av solution, personal firewall, applicaton control and device control for a good price It's easy to install and manage. we're managing about 3000 clients and servers which are spread over the whole world from winterthur switzerland and it just runs smooth. and if you've got a 802.11q network you can license NAC (network access control). With these feature you can for example move non compliant pc's into a special network (vlan). 

If you're able to see your webpage when the URL is , you don't need to worry about manually specifying port 443, because SSL/TLS is working automatically. You can confirm this by using a number of tools. OpenSSL, for example: 

The item in Zabbix is , type "Zabbix Agent (Active)", with information type "log". I'm using the following trigger tied to this item: I've tried leaving the "error" part out of the item, and changing the trigger value to equal 0. No matter what I do, I get a trigger status of UNKNOWN in the Events tab. I'm not sure what I'm missing here, does someone see the issue? I checked the agent log on the server, and it doesn't mention any issues. 

I forget I ever asked this question! I figured out the problem with the help of tech support. The issue was that we were monitoring the OpenVPN TCP port on the server with Zabbix, which was opening a connection every minute to confirm the port was open. Once it confirmed the port was open, Zabbix would close the connection, causing the "Connection reset" messages. In retrospect the ephemeral port numbers of the connecting client should have been a bigger clue that the issue wasn't with OpenVPN itself. Nothing like finding out that your problem was caused by you all along. 

I'm planning on migrating 2 HyperV VMs that are currently running on Windows Server 2012R2 to a new server running 2008R2. What's the best way to migrate the VMs? Will replication work between the two OSes? How about the export feature in HyperV? I know that it's not possible to move directly from 2008R2 to 2012R2 without an intermediate conversion, but I can't find any info on doing the reverse. 

I can't seem to find an example of how each of the log levels in slapd work. I want slapd to log the users who are logging in, and the server that they are trying to log into, as well as any authentication errors. I've tried using this LDIF to modify the logging level to every level (except for the debugging levels): dn: cn=config changetype: modify replace: olcLogLevel olcLogLevel: Can someone point me to a more helpful resource than the OpenLDAP manual? Or give me explanation on what typs of information the logging levels produce? Thanks for your help. 

Have you investigated using a container service, such as Docker or LXC? That would allow you to use the version of PHP and OpenSSL (and many other programs as well) that you desire. It also wouldn't interfere with the system's PHP and SSL installations, it's entirely self-contained. Docker has prebuilt PHP environments it seems: $URL$ LXC how-to: $URL$ If you're brand new to containers, I'd say that Docker is a good place to start, as there is a boat load of community support for it. 

Given that you said it's not feasible to keep spare Enterprise drives around, I'd say that going for the consumer drives (that is, the Samsung EVO or PRO SSDs) is a better call, since you lose all remaining redundancy in RAID 5 when you lose a disk. And having to wait for a new drive to show up means that you're running the risk of total data loss if another disk has an issue before the array can be rebuild. So keeping the spare drives on hand is a good call. Also, what's the reason for using RAID5? It's performance is pretty awful on writes, and though the SSD will make up for some of that, I'd go for RAID1 or 10 unless you absolutely need to maximize the usable space on 3 drives. 

You can also take a look at the XenServer from Citrix. It's like the ESXi freely available. I don't have much experience with the XenServer and don't now it's unlicensed feature set. I would recommend ESXi because the migration of the VM's from the VMware Server to ESXi should be nearly painless (thanks to VMware Converter). Also you already got the basic knowledge about the VMware envionments (naming conventions etc.) VMware will not discontinue ESXi 4 or change it's pricing (basicly free...). At least not in the near future. The end of life of the Vmware server product line wasn't "silently". You just have to know where to look ;-) $URL$ 

DNS (is the forward/reverse lookup for the used dc's,servers and clients correct) Does a firewall block port 445 (tcp) or some other AD related ports? Are the file permissions on the DFS root set correctly? (a directory on the dc is created for every target you define) 

I am looking for a PCI or PCI Express based Network card with builtin VPN possibilities or a network card which allows to flash its firmware vyatta, ipcop , routeros or any similar os. The idea is to allow remote support of a server system (access to its oob interface and os) even though the systems operating system is unable to boot correctly and setup the VPN connection by itself. May this little drawing helps explaining it: 

If you're not using ubuntu or debian you cant just copy and paste this commands but maybe they point you into the right direction. have a nice evening. 

I'm using squirrelmail. It's pretty small and easy to configure. The "best" solution depends on your needs and personal taste ;-) 

Also try to deactivate NetBIOS and LMHOSTS for your Network Adapter. You can change the settings in the TCP/IP Properties of the used Network Connection, under Advanced -> WINS. 

do you use vmfs3 for he datastores or vmfs2. vmfs2 is supported by esx4.1 but i head that you can get some issues if you try to use a vmfs2 datastore with different esx versions. did you try to restart the mgmt-vmware and the vmware-vpxa services on both esx 4.0 servers and rescan the datastores on each host, not only on the esx4.1? greetings grub 

You need to add specific information for update-rc.d to your script. You'll find an example in /etc/init.d/skeleton 

to the file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf if it exists. I do not know how ubuntu 9.04 or 9.10 do store the blacklisted modules. 

You've got a pretty neat setup here ;-) Are the vCPU's used to their max capacity? What are the graphs for the CPU wait, CPU ready and CPU usage telling you? As more vCPU's you add to a VM as more overhead is generated on the host system to manage the vCPU's and map them to the physical one. At some point you wont get more performance out of a VM by simply adding more vCPU's. Did you check if there is a performance issue on the iSCSI SAN? Check the graphs disk read and disk write requests and of course the disk read and write rates and compare them to the ones of the phyiscal cluster member. Maybe some of the values can point you into the right direction. 

If you want to maximize the bandwidth of the memory subsystem, you'll want to install at least one DIMM per channel (6 in this case). If you want to install more than 6 DIMMs, you'll want to keep adding them in multiple of 6. This is because each memory channel can be used independently, so if you only populate two slots, the CPU will write the data over two channels. If you populate all 6 channels, the CPU can write data to RAM over all 6 channels at the same time. $URL$ 

Also, they state "Mixing components operating at different internal clock frequencies is not supported and will not be validated by Intel. Combining processors from different power segments is also not supported." $URL$ (page 165) $URL$ (page 28) $URL$ (page 25) 

I think that the /isolinux/ ones are for booting a live CD using ISOLINUX, whereas the pxeboot ones are for booting CentOS from a PXE server. PXE booting is when you obtain the kernel and initrd from another server using a TFTP client built into the network interface. Typically you'll see something like "Network Boot" in the boot list in your BIOS. 

I have a main backup server running rsnapshot, with ~2TB of backups stored on it. After the nightly backups, I copy the contents of the rsnapshot directory to an offsite server, using . However, this seems to copy the entire contents of the backup directory every night, as the offsite copy takes ~9 hours to complete. I assume my rsync command doesn't have the right switches, but there may be something else I'm missing. Any ideas? 

OpenVPN is running on pfSense 2.0-release. Until recently, these messages had not occurred. In the OpenVPN server logs, the follwing set of messages repeats every minute 

This seems to indicate that nginx is crashing immediately, if it had been started earlier. Have you checked the contents of to see what the process is doing? EDIT: Also, if you tell us your OS and version of nginx, we can give more detailed answers. 

There is also netcat, which is another very simple networking tool that can make arbitrary TCP and UDP connections. 

I've searched high and low trying to find a method that allows me to store GPG keys for existing users in an OpenLDAP server. The only relevant how-to I've found is this. However, I'm unable to get this method to work with the existing OpenLDAP database. I've successfully imported the schema, but I can't figure out how to actually add information to the fields specified in the schema. If I can provide any additional information, please let me know. 

You can create a private network that only your VPN server has access to. OpenVPN will create a TUN or TAP interface, and you can configure whatever address range you'd like for that interface to use. There is also a setting in OpenVPN that allows clients to communicate with one another. However, I agree with EEAA that this is likely to become very messy very quickly, and I'd recommend trying to overcome the issues on the local network first.
