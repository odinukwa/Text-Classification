Need some assistance with a small query. Can a 5508 WLC be configured to host multiple concurrent captive portals? Have been googling for the information but if anyone has the info available, I would appreciate it. Thanks:-) 

We have monitoring in place via an snmp based nms from which we can run reports on what hasn't/has been used over a time period. If a port hasn't been used in over 3 months, then we reclaim it for someone else to use. Your commands as shown in your post actually works ok on a 3750. I guess not removing the cabling but disabling the unused ports may be an option in the interim. Then only re-enable as per client request. 

You can then check your spanning tree root paths for vlan1 (default) on both sw1 and sw2. And add many other test vlans for your studies. Note that should you shutdown sw1, your client R1 will still be cut off as it only has one link (path). You could also consider researching/adding vtp version 2 to your scenario to propagate the vlans you create on ESW1 or ESW2 to the access switches. 

This link has a good intro on ospf and design of campus architectures. $URL$ Routing Protocol(1).pdf 

Taking into consideration that you haven't posted your switches makes and configs, your WAN link could be your bottleneck. While saving on some costs it is usually a half-duplex connection. Recommendation:- For the desired bandwidth between your sites, it makes more sense to rent fibre (or sdsl) from a Telco/ISP provider as a point-to-point between your two sites (or install your own fibre). 

They should not differ much (and/or at all) and be inter-operable as OSPF v2 is a ratified standard: $URL$ 

That is a good way to design and you may want to consider adding a third layer to your design. Your core switches appear to be a core/distribution setup and you really want to separate your core switches so they aren't affected by spanning tree loops, yes they do happen. You could implement ospf between your cores and the distribution switches which could then be split between buildings, floors, geographically, etc. Your vlans spanning tree roots are then on the distribution switches. You could then test your vPC/MLAG solution without taking out the whole network :-) Not really sure which vendor solution has been selected but they should have documentation available for design and best practice for high availability/redundancy. Side note: some designs even take routing to the access switches thus containing spanning tree loops to the access switch stack but I think the expense is best spent on a couple of beefy core switches. And you can test it all in GNS3 (or similar app) prior to deploying :-) 

Haven't messed around with OUs in AD for some time but if I recall correctly, you could update the passwords on all windows clients with Group Policy. I would seriously test this before deploying. A quick google search showed many links and howtos. $URL$ 

The situation may vary on the services you have contracted for with your ISP. If for example your ISP provides a 'normal' Layer 3 WAN connectivity, then your rfc1918 /30 or /31 IP addressing will not work as your WAN facing ip addresses will be unroutable. But if your ISP provides your WAN connectivity through their managed business mpls vpn, they may provide you with ip addressing from rfc1918 addresses. Mpls vpn implementations are very common with business ISPs and have been around for quite awhile. And there are costs involved. $URL$ 

It will probably depend on a couple of factors such as who is the ISP and what they will support. A list of compatible routers are available at $URL$ The Cisco 827 router does not appear to be listed there. 

@John Hengst - I concur with cmschmidt15 towards providing a guaranteed service to the pods with structured cabling. We do a couple of shows per year and primarily provide cabling installed by licensed cablers. But there are always a couple of pods where the clients are physically too far and wireless becomes the solution. You could investigate installing installing an access point as a workgroup bridge. Here is an example from one manufacturer and just about all other manufacturers have that option. $URL$ And avoid using 802.11b/g if you can but use 802.11a as Androids supports them. Not much interference on the 5GHz ranges compared to the 2.4GHz ranges. 

Is this is a school that doesn't have an infrastructure, you really want to start building the infrastructure properly as there will be a future demand for more connections/bandwidth/file servers/wireless/etc. I have walked in many a school where parents and other unqualified helpers created standardless spaghetti networks so as to cut down costs but later cost more $$$ to fix. Search the web for structured cabling (blackbox.com had a good pdf), physical/logical infrastructure and post more of your questions for this community to assist you after you've researched your solutions. It's not that often nowadays that someone has the opportunity to start a school in the right way towards IT :-) Hint: Lookup a star topology, it's the easiest to troubleshoot and scale up from. 

Add another trunk link connecting ESW1 to ESW2. Make ESW1 stp root primary and ESW2 stp root secondary. 

@aidan beaumont - All the answers provided by the multiple techs on this post are very helpful to your quest. To your list add a communications rack at least 42 RUs with horizontal/vertical cablemanagement in a secured air-conditioned room. Which is properly grounded by an electrician. Two racks are even better, one for your cabling and POE network switches. The other for your servers and other comms equipment. All your cabling (preferably cat6a shielded) can terminate into the patch panels within the rack and serve your POE wireless access points Planning a clean a thorough installation from day 1 sure helps later for when you add growth and locating what is connected to your network. :-) 

It's very common for environments to grow and have it built that way over time. Each switch the packet will have to pass through is considered a hop as the individual switches have to process/tag/untag, unicast/broadcast packets, etc. If you could direct connect your switches to the mdf with single-mode fibre, that would be a performance plus as you can upgrade to 10G or more. But that would have to be justified with a valid business case... But in those unplanned environments where you have to piggy back from switch to switch with cat5e/cat6/cat6a/cat6a-shielded (mostly stuck with 1G per link due to distance) make sure your uplinks/downlinks are bonded in an etherchannel (or similar) and never go over the maximum number of hops. Until you have your new fibre in place, I'd recommend to have a exact model spare switch on the side towards minimising downtime when one of the switches suffers from some fault. For the hops, see this link from a manufacturer: www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/19120-122.html 

This does happen a bit to have duplicate subnets when trying to setup a vpn. Use your favourite web search engine to search for "site to site vpn with duplicate subnets" For example: $URL$ The RV320 is a nice SOHO router and performs well for a small business. Please let us know how you go with your set-up. 

Perhaps you could investigate using ip sla for your needs. These links may not be exactly what you are searching for but it could help with searching on ip sla. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

If you are looking for isolation between the desktops and only communicate with your gateway/router, investigate PVlans (private vlans):- $URL$ 

This model of ws-3750-48ps-s isn't covered by Cisco anymore. See $URL$ You could replace it with the still supported 3750x switches as this series is compatible with the old 3750-48 switch stack. 

You will have difficulties towards configuring dhcp on the dell 5524 which is a layer 2 switch. A good switch in my experience, but it isn't a layer 3 switch. You should use a layer 3 switch that provides the wanted dhcp options and/or relay the dhcp packets from your 5524 to a dedicated dhcp server (*nix dhcpd or window$ dhcp). See this link for some more information: $URL$ 

Yes spannning tree is for preventing loops at layer2. In this simple setup you may want to add a few of things: 

From the information here the HP1810-24G supports LACP $URL$ Have not played with microtik but their documentation was very easy to google: $URL$ $URL$ The current (and future) troubles I think you may be encountering are possibly with the HP1810, I have deployed the Version1 of these HPs in the past and found out they were really intended for cheap access switches, did not have a cli and did not properly support spanning-tree and had to rely on the upstream switch/aggregator which then was an old Layer2 dell powerconnect 5224. Being a HP shop, perhaps you could consider replacing the HP1810-24G with a more featured/robust HP switch that fully supports stp, rstp, mstp and the other networking features that you require? 

Note that you haven't mentioned which models of switches you have in production. Can you post? For a simple solution (to begin with) you may want to investigate the redesign of your datacentre switching paths to make it more resilient to individual switch reboots. The image linked below is taken from Cisco but you can use any other manufacturer as long as they support what you want and are compatible with your current production switches:- $URL$ Placing a couple of Layer 3 distribution switches, uplinking your current switches and making these new distribution switches the spanning tree root will provide the resilience you seek. 

Not too sure towards the 500 series switches but in practice best that you install the new code on all the switches within the stack. There are some nice commands to upgrade the images on the 2960, 3560, 3750, etc switches but not quite sure if the 500 series supports them. If you have a cli on the switches, verify the bin image with the "verify /md5 flash:/"image-path.bin". Next in config mode configure the stack to boot from the new bin image "#boot system flash:/"path-to-image.bin" Very important is that you have access to the console port of the switch for emergency access. If the switches are at a remote site, perform a test upgrade in your lab/office to ensure the upgrade path is successful first. It's quite a straightforward procedure performed hundreds of times by network admins bust always best to be prepared with eventualities. The reload at a convenient time where the users will not be impacted as much :-) 

In a managed Cisco wired solution you commonly find ip dhcp snooping used in combination with ip arp inspection and ip source guard. Though while googling for the same solution some time ago, I viewed other vendors also providing excellent protection against dhcp starvation attacks, mac address spoofing and cam table overflow attack. Guess one the answers would be a combination of many factors such as a manageable enterprise access switch, a well patched/configured dhcpd server and a good syslog server that can record what is going on in your network. 

For your home router to establish a WAN connection to your ISP, a few things specific to PPP must happen first. You may also have to do some research on LCP and NCP. Check this link below, it may have the answer you are looking for (see the excerpt on PPPoE below): $URL$ PPPoE has two phases, the discovery phase and the session phase.• Discovery: The client identifies the available servers. To complete the phase the client and server must communicate a session-id. During the discovery phase all packets are delivered to the PPPoE control plane (CPM or MDA). The IOM identifies these packets by their ethertype (0x8863). → PPPoE Active Discovery Initiation (PADI). This broadcast packet is used by the client to search for an active server (Access Concentrator) providing access to a service. → PPPoE Active Discovery Offer (PADO): If the access server can provide the service it should respond with a unicast PADO to signal the client it may request connectivity. Multiple servers may respond and the client may choose a server to connect to. → PPPoE Active Discovery Request (PADR): After the client receives a PADO it will use this unicast packet to connect to a server and request service. → PPPoE Active Discovery Session-confirmation (PADS) A server may respond to the client with this unicast packet to establish the session and provide the session-id. Once the PADS was provided the PPP phase begins. • Session: Once the session ID is established connectivity is available for the duration of the session, using ethertype 0x8864. Either client or server can terminate a session. During the life of the session the packets may be uniquely identified by the client’s MAC address and session-id. The session can terminate either by PADT sent by the client or server or by an LCP Terminate-Request packet. 

Interesting networking question that you probably partly answered yourself; huge datacentres are globally located in key areas where very high speed internet is available to the peering hosting companies. For your research investigate companies such as Akamai and Cloudfront comes to mind. And the new kid on the block Venturebeat. Technologies used to load balance between the global sites are many (mostly based on Linux I think). $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ www.sanog.org/resources/sanog24/Peering_Update.pdf $URL$ 

You could do your own wireless survey and then select the best channels to use for your two WAPs. Here is a discussion on doing your own survey:- $URL$ Unless your clients cannot do 802.11a don't advertise anything in the 2.4GHz range...you'll receive complaints when someone uses the microwave or some other interferer. For load balancing the clients, here is another discussion that may help:- $URL$ 

If the axis camera is a poe device, you should be able to locate it on the poe switch due to it's power draw from the switch. Then as mentioned by Ron and kaspend, it should be easy to work out the ip address. OTOH, if it isn't a poe device and still powered up, you could use a network scanning utility like nmap to scan the ip range provided by the dhcp server. Nmap is great to use if you want to know what is on your network: $URL$ Or use one of it's variants that has a gui such as Zenmap:- $URL$ 

Your clients suffer from bandwidth limitations should wireless (half-duplex or full-duplex) be used. That is considered a bad solution as the wireless will be subject to many sorts of interference including weather and idiots who think it is fun to disrupt or piggy back on your wireless. Whereas with single-mode fibre you can easily upgrade from 1G to 10G or more when there is need for it. It is way more secure than wireless, scalable and you only have to worry about backhoes digging where they shouldn't. Which is rare but does happen. Go with fibre, it is the proper solution. 

The 2960s is an access switch with very limited L3 capabilities and you really want the Layer 3 vlan interfaces (SVIs) on a better performing Layer 3 switch acting as your core where you can implement ACLs on the L3 SVIs. After removing all the wireless SVIs in your 2960 switch modify the trunk interface to your wap. This part to your WAP needs a slight modification:- interface GigabitEthernet1/0/22 description (Uplink - TRUNK to WAP) switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan ?? switch port trunk allowed vlan 100,200 spanning-tree portfast trunk Not too sure how the trendnet is communicating with the switch over the trunk interface but this support page mentions it's administration is by default over PVID 1:- $URL$ Not too sure how you've configured your WAPs to broadcast on the channels and how many you have deployed but you could post your infrastructure here for everyone to help.
