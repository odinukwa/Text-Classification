This works great at displaying an HTTP 404 page when you try to access a non-existent file in the browser, but it is not showing the error page when accessing existing files using the following syntax: 

You can use AutoHotkey to compile a script which disables certain key combinations and have a "toggle" keyboard shortcut which suspends the script (thereby enabling the keys). Here is a simple example: 

*I have a few bookmarks simply mapped to host names on my network. Hardcore: Alternatively, you could export your bookmarks to HTML, and write a little program which scans the file, collecting keyword and bookmark pairings which are then sorted before printing the result. I was going to do this, until I played around with the search... 

Since you are using Notepad++, be sure to set the Encoding to when dealing with non-ANSI characters (e.g. Chinese). 

If you save the Word document as a Web Page (*.htm; *.html), embedded images will be extracted to a folder in the same location as the new HTML file. From there, you can sort by size and find the culprit. 

This is normal behavior in Microsoft Office 2010. To get to the printer options, you have to click Printer Properties. This change is part of the new, streamlined File menu known as the Backstage. 

If a domain name is found in the Reverse DNS lookup, then you can do a Whois lookup for the domain name itself: $URL$ 

As someone who used to work for one of the largest domain name registrars, I am not aware of any registry providing a method to search their databases to get a complete list of domain names that are currently registered for that TLD. 

Using the Style Configurator, Notepad++ does not have a preference to change the style of text before a colon or equals sign in an file. It is a trivial detail, but it would help make overlooking configuration files a lot easier. , , , , or does not modify the text before the colon. 

You can add as many browsers as you like, just copy the format above. All you need to know is the , which can be found using Task Manager. 

To install an Upgrade version of Windows 7, you must install it over a genuine copy of Windows. In other words, even if you choose to do a clean install, the Windows 7 Upgrade installer must first detect a valid Windows license already on the drive, virtual or not. This is why it worked the first time (you had Windows Vista installed), but does not work now (the virtual drive does not have Windows XP/Vista installed). 

Obviously, it is not a complete program. It can be improved by testing if a name or window already exists in the array, etc... But functionality wise, this is as simple as it gets! :) 

Note: Firefox 8+ no longer supports bitmap fonts, so you may have to find a TrueType (TTF) clone or alternative to replace Terminal. 

You can use your PDF reader's column selection feature to copy each column of the table individually. Each column can then be pasted one-by-one into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. For example, useAlt+Drag with Adobe Reader's Select Tool. 

What you are seeing outside of the browser is the accurate rendering of the font (based on the file given). Looking at the CSS source, the author has made adjustments with and : 

A different Window Color and Appearance window pops up! Select from the Item drop-down, and change the font's Bold (B) setting. 

The way this works is as follows: If the alert box's message matches "Adblock detected, please consider disabling it", then discard it to the JS console (it will not be displayed). Otherwise, display the alert box as a box. 

If instead you would like to maximize the window instead of pressing F11, replace above with: Outline: 

There are two common cases for the fonts appearing too small in Firefox. Case 1: You may have accidentally changed the page zoom. Set the page zoom back to by pressing Ctrl+0 or using the GUI: . Note: There is a related preference in for remembering page specific zoom levels. If you do not care for this feature, or frequently change the zoom level by accident, you can set the following to false: 

I assume that this is possible, considering that you can open the View Available Networks window with 

You have the choice to embed or link to an object when you insert content into your document from another source. Paste Special also gives you a choice to link objects from the clipboard. 

As Oliver implied, you can use AutoHotkey. Creating keyboard shortcuts and sending keystrokes are of the most basic functions of AHK. So, assigning Ctrl+P to is as simple as: 

Foxit Reader is a freeware application for Windows which can add text to *.PDF files. To add text, the tool is located under . Note: A portable version also exists and is available from PortableApps.com. 

I'm no security expert, but here is my two cents: Bank account numbers are indeed sensitive, but not much use without other information (e.g. routing number, social security). Every time I've ever needed to withdraw from an account, I needed the routing number or valid identification. I suppose it depends on the bank, but fraud prevention is not a new idea. In summary, it's like someone finding out your username, but not your password. 

will give you page numbers with two digits. Now, press F9 or select Update Field to display the result. 

You do use the tool, but you also need to isolate the color using the tool. Here is how I accomplished replacing a specific color to transparent: 

Apple states that Home Sharing allows you to stream media between computers, so I would think that files are not copied over permanently. 

So, the solution lies in using larger font sizes or replacing the default Japanese font uses in an application with one that supports hinted characters for all sizes (e.g. Arial Unicode). To globally remap/substitute a font in Windows, you can modify or add Registry values under: 

It is usually necessary to wait a few milliseconds after opening a content menu so the keys are sent when the focus is actually on the context menu. So, you can play around with the Sleep command until you find an acceptable time (I used milliseconds in my example): 

Note: I have chosen to use the environment variable, as the full path can vary based on your system's configuration. If you installed Windows 7 on the drive and your home folder is , then expands to:
