We use Cisco WAAS appliances for WAN optimization. With increasing traffic, we noticed that the connection limit was frequently reached. In case of our WAVE-574-K9 with 3 GB RAM, there was a limit of 750 connections. So we decided to upgrade the RAM, since it's said that this will raise the supported number of connections. No problem to get 3rd party memory, since it's an OEM version of a Hewlett-Packard Proliant server. After I installed 2x2 GB RAM modules, removing one 1 GB module. However, the connection limit stays the same, as I can see in the WAAS central manager monitoring. How can I get more connections? 

Since the other requirements were already met, the connection should be successful.

is one of the many IOS command modes. If you need it in different modes, you have to call it for each one - type to get a long list of modes. An example for checking for a dhcp snooped IP, type in global conf mode 

If you made an ether channel / port channel, don't worry, the traffic will go over the remaining fiber. Otherwise you could consider to make a channel. To be on the safe side, run several times for interfaces to both fibers on one switch and watch the counters. The one which doesn't change at all, while the other one does, should be safer to pull. 

in global configuration mode. The default modulus would be 1024. With the ASDM it can also be done in the configuration menu, device management, identity certificates, add, new: 

This won't work the way you describe it. Each connection has its own public IP belonging to your ISPs. You'll need public IP space (typically called PI space - provider indepentent) which you can advertise via BGP to both your ISP's at the same time. The setup you describes doesn't have a shared public address between the two connections and your ISPs won't route eachothers addresses, so what you're describing is a server which is reachable through two networks on two different IP addresses. NAT rules can't solve this for you. 

For each given source and destination, asymmetry can occur on both levels. As a result, it's very hard to answer your question. It may be true (since there could be less networks and hops involved), but it's hard to give an answer which applies to the general case. Also, anything which may seem to be nearby looking from one end may be further away looking from the other end. 

General rule of thumb: never use documentational space. It has a very specific purpose, don't ever use it for anything else or you'll regret it at a later time. If these two servers only need to talk to eachother and don't require any other connectivity for the given IPv6 addresses I'd use ULA space: pick a somewhat random /64 from within and use that between the servers. 

As Ron Maupin pointed out, this is not uncommon. It's especially used between autonomous systems speaking BGP, and there actually is a thing called the "Default Free Zone", the core of the internet in which no default gateways are configured: all routes are exchanged via BGP. Not having default routes there actually serves a purpose: it prevents traffic to unallocated destinations to be discarded at the first possible hop, so it will not bounce between networks. 

on one side. The following traffic will cause the IPSEC tunnel to be reestablished. You can do it on your side, entering the remote IP. Or login to the remote site, but possibly you have to do it outside the VPN, so using a different interface, for example using the public IP instead of the IP to which you connect through the tunnel. There will be a short VPN outage while reestablishing the tunnel. After entering that command, ensure that the tunnel is up again, such as doing a ping through it. 

Since you are temporarily able to ping the server, VPN and ACLs should be fine. I recommend to verify: 

Now I can see my candidates, with actually 0 packets input over time, even if my expression matches numbers just ending with 0. I could make it more perfect, but being easy to remember is also a benefit. The interface names right before each 0 packets input lines are my candidates. 

After adding RAM, it's necessary to repartition the disks for resetting the space allocation for the data redundancy elimination: 

To connect two Catalyst switch stacks, I use EtherChannel, i.e. I aggregate several ports on each switch to get more bandwidth and higher availability than with just a single port. However, the link doesn't work yet. What could cause the problem? 

On a large Cisco Catalyst switch stack, almost all switchports are patched. I need to identify the ports, which are not in use, for connecting further devices. Following switchports, cabling, patch fields and sockets to possible end devices is laborious and even then there could be temporarily used sockets. Looking at the activity of port LEDs is not reliable, since a user device can be shut off. What's the easiest way to detect all unused switchports via IOS commands? 

As Ron Maupin already mentioned, anything in those three ranges defined in RFC1918 will be fine, those are assigned for local networks. Personally, I wouldn't pick one of the more obvious ranges like or if you ever plan to offer services like VPN for remote workers. Most of the home routers use those by default for their local networks, so it can be wise to stay clear of ranges to prevent an overlap. I'd pick a range from the network (which seems to be less used in home routers), and not the first , so for example . 

Unless you're talking about the AS-numbers defined in RFC6696 meant for private use (64512 - 65534), all AS-numbers are assigned by RIRs to their LIRs. 

You're not giving us a lot of details like routing tables, but one thing I've seen quite often which may cause this is situations where all network traffic is routed via the VPN connection, isolating the machine from the local network. 

Yes, this absolutely is a problem. Don't ever mix different types of cabling. Multimode has a 50 or 62.5 micron core diameter, while single mode fiber typically has a 9 micron core. If you connect two fibers with different core diameters, you'll lose a lot of the light going through the connector, resulting in a link flapping or being down. 

The last option is most common. There is only a limited number of transit providers who don't buy transit from another ISP, they're usually called Tier 1. Most ISP's combine IXP connectivity and IP transit for their global connectivity. Edit: Here's a real world example: I used NLNOG Ring's to create a graph of how networks around the world reach Facebook's network. . As you can see from this example, a lot of networks reach Facebook via DE-CIX (the IXP in Frankfurt, Germany, one of the largest in the world), but there are also a large number of networks which use Telia (AS1299) and NTT (AS2914) to reach Facebook. Telia and NTT are tier 1 transit providers. Edit 2: Since the image is downscaled it's hard to read. here is a fullsize version. 

While ACLs are a simple and safe way, it doesn't scale well indeed. If your router provides VRF or at least the the VRF Lite feature you could group VLANs into VRFs. A VRF can be seen like a virtual router, VRF instances cannot talk to each other unless you explicitely define routing between them. In a complex network, I group VLANs into several security domains done with VRFs, such as a VRF for office clients and server, a VRF for tech devices (door access control, lifts, cctv, ...), a VRF for guests and visitors. 

It can be good practice, to leave unused switchports shutdown. So it's easy to identify them using or the like. And you don't run into problems if you use a switchport which was definitly shut off before. 

I know we can use auto-completion (tab key) and abbreviated commands (such as ) to speed up typing. However, I'm still not satisfied with typing crypting chains such as for . Can I define shortcuts for often used command sequences, and how? 

over satellite connections (VSAT) for cruise ships, with latency between 600 ms and 800 ms, depending on satellite and earth station (possible additional transatlantic latency). One central manager and a policy manage a network of a dozen appliances. RDP is much more responsive thanks to TCP optimizing, furthermore web applications and file replication save much bandwidth. There's a virtual version vWAAS, which we plan to install soon. I know iDirect satellite modems provide a very good TCP optimization, if you would be able to use them. 

I can recommend Cisco WAAS (Wide Area Application Services), specificall WAVE (Wide Area Virtualization Engine). We use it for 

The entire internet is built on asymmetric routing, so it's very common. Clients are interested in the interface they receive the packet on and the source of the packet, not which router passed it to them on that interface. Asymmetric routing can get problematic however when devices keeping track of state (especially firewalls) and NAT are involved, but as far as I can tell this isn't the case in your example. 

Link local addresses are used in one single network segment, they can't be routed. Unique local addresses can be routed, but only within one routing domain. So an ISP can choose to use ULA for services which can't be publicly accessible. 

No, that's incorrect. You're using netmask , so that are two different s. Just because you can summarize them to a doesn't make it a . If you want this to work, you'll need to change the netmask on all devices to , or place a router which is connected to both s and routes packets between them. 

Both are used very often: private interconnects are often used between a BGP transit customer and its upstream networks as well as between networks which need to exchange a lot of traffic, to offload this traffic from IXP links. BGP sessions via IXPs are often used to connect with a lot of networks without having to set up private interconnects with each network. 

PSTN is only used for dial up and DSL services. Other access technologies use cable, fiber, radio waves, etc. Typically, cellular network stations are connected using one of the latter. There's no such thing as one lowest form of communication in terms of a specific type of carrier. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages when it comes to distance, price, capacity, etc. But you can be sure that most communication between networks isn't done on PSTN, it's mostly fiber.
