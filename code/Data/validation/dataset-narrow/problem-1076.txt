others could simply use it (with strong crypto) and exhaust monthly data quota/trigger speed throttling, unknown users could use it for illegal things (file sharing, sending blackmail letters, whatever), which would be traced back to the "evil twin" operator. 

With this in mind, you could just put up "free WLAN" signs to attract other (anonymous) users. This might make the rogue access point operator think twice :) 

Yes, one may have both directories and (sym-)links in a tar file: see Tar Format Documentation. In this case, one would have an archived structure, but no file content in the tar archive. 

...should list the files, you can pass the output to yourself (I'm not writing the here to encourage you to double-check the list of files). You might need instead of the backquotes if there are too many files in the current directory. 

You would then be able to copy stuff to the drive with both operating systems, and they would be able to handle the mounting in the file explorer for you. This would give you the luxury of having each operating system use the computers hardware to its fullest potential without having to use virtualization, or change your current setup again all while never disconnecting the USB from the computer. 

I have two connections to my share from 2 different IP address, just wanted to show as an example. Port 139 is for our NetBIOS Session Service Port 445 is for our SMB file sharing Regards, Chris 

If you would rather do a virtualized environment, then I would personally create a shared folder on Windows, and have Ubuntu browse the network with the file explorer which should find the Windows share with ease. We could do this vice-versa and create a folder on Ubuntu that we will share on the network for Windows. We would have to make some small changes to make this work because you need this share to work even without an internet connection. The changes are small and will allow you to share with or without an internet connection no matter where you go. 

I was trying to take apart my laptop to replace the DC jack for it, and the screw inside of the casing was very hard to remove, so after messing with it for about 15 minutes, the plus sign (or the head) was erased and became more of a circular square. Is there any way to take it out without breaking anything? 

I got a cheap 64GB card from eBay for like $10 for my Venue 8 Pro Windows 8 tablet, and after installing something to a folder or copying large files to any folder, that folder just gets corrupted. I've permanently mounted it to a folder on my C drive, and say after downloading a torrent to the Downloads folder (on it) or downloading a game from Steam (where Steam is installed on the SD card), the Steamapps folder just gets corrupted. I can't delete these corrupted folders. I've analyzed that it happens after a lot of writes to the SD card and the only way to fix it is to format the card. The FS is NTFS. Is this happening because this is a cheap SD card, or is there any other reason? Screenshot of the error while browsing the folder: 

Might be related to sudo credential caching on by default - check and try to edit the file to change this behavior. 

Deactivate "Reverse Polish Notation" in the menu :) Otherwise you have to enter "10 Enter 20 +" to get 30. It's operating with a stack in RPN mode. To be fair, there is a kind of bug in RPN mode - pressing "+" with only one operand on the stack should have signaled an error to you (as "+" operation in RPN is defined as fetching two operands from stack, adding them, and pushing the result back on the stack). HP calculators would not allow this. 

As a start, it it quite difficult to determine if a page actually is blank. For example, there might be objects visible outside of the PDF box of your choice (like trimming marks), or object layers which can be switched on/off conditionally. For a programmatic solution, you could either 

If you are planning on recycling them, then I think destroying them (physically) is good enough as long as it's for sure not possible to somehow fix the hard drive. 

Up to this point everything worked correctly, and once the command was finished (took less than an hour), I went ahead and rebooted, removing my old flash drive. Once it booted in with the new flash drive I was extremely happy that everything worked flawlessly until I went to install some packages with YUM, and I only have 12.5 MB of free space remaining! I went back into gparted and this is the "screen shot" of it: 

I installed CentOS 6 into my 4GB flash drive, and everything worked fine until I needed more space. I have another flash drive with 8GB of space (which is all I really need) and so I formatted it with gparted to ext4. Once it was done formatting I went into the Terminal and put this command: 

You could use for unsetting (or setting) environment variables: "The env utility executes another utility after modifying the environment as specified on the command line." 

Correctness of results is the limit. When starting to overclock, some combinatorial circuit won't complete its operations in time any more, but only with some operands (e.g. an adder when carrying "1" bits)... but the sequential logic systems will still use the "intermediate" result. With moderate overclocking, usually it still looks as if would be working fine, but only until critical operands meet! Some computations will start to yield incorrect results, with arbitrary effects to your data (including corruption of data, or even total data loss). 

Best thing is: this won't modify your current execution environment. (Edit: apparently is a FreeBSD extension... please let us know if this works under Linux, too!) 

I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop and I am buying another one, newer laptop and I have about 200GBs of stuff like games/apps on my hard drive. I could upload it online or do it with a USB drive but that will take a LONG time. Is it possible to transfer all data (possibly the OS too) on a different hard drive? Or just switch the hard drive of one laptop and stick it in another one? 

I have a 500GB hard drive (model - HM500JJ) and I need to take the top cover off as I need to fix it but I can't seem to find the right screw driver for it. I've bought a Torx T8 screw driver and it seemed to have the right structure but it was too big to fit in and I've looked everywhere for a way to open it but just can't find the right screwdriver online. 

I recently had a laptop that would randomly shut down at any time and wouldn't boot after clicking on the restart button. I was able to track down the culprit in Event Viewer and see what was going on. Event Viewer will log many things about the boot process, such as the time it took to boot, application errors on boot, etc... Here is a link to the site that I followed: $URL$ This is for Windows 7, but I tested many of the options listed in Windows 10 successfully. Once you start to use the filter with IDs, you will be able to really narrow down what is causing the slow boots. 

This will delete all network server connections. It would also be worth looking at the other saved credentials in the Windows Credential Manager, to see if there is already an entry for the mapped drive. I would assume an entry would be there since you specified to reconnect at login. I would also double check your entry you made to make sure you have the server\username box and password box correct. 

Well there are a lot of reasons actually. It's a lot easier to damage an ARM device, so most manufacturers keep it closed. It's really the same thing with Apple, actually. You would have to root your Android in order to mess with it a little bit more. Also, warranties with phones/tablets are different than warranties with computers. 

I am assuming that I somehow need to extend one of the partions and remove the unallocated, but I don't know how. Any help is appreciated, thank you! 

On KeyTweak, it wouldn't even fetch the key in KeyMapper it would just open a new browser window. I've tried pressing Function and that Esc button, control and the escape button, etc. 

I recently bought a Venue 8 pro and an OTG cable in order to plug in a wired keyboard and mouse. I have a regular Dell mouse that I used on both Linux and Windows machines with no problems. When I plug in the mouse, it works as expected for about a minute, and just disconnects automatically and says that it is having issues and to try reconnecting it. I have already restarted and switched ports and disabled power options to disable the device to save power and it still wouldn't work. I just don't know what to do now, I just bought this tablet. Edit: The mouse reconnects and this is what it says in the device manager: 

If you can access both of these servers from your main computer, and get authenticated, then you can do this in file explorer without having to remote into either computer, per se. Type in the ip address in file explorer in the address bar with c$ at the end to get the C:\ of the server you're trying to access. For example, \\192.168.1.2\c$ will try to access the C:\ of the server with the address 192.168.1.2. Open two file explorers and do one server in one file explorer, and the other server in the other file explorer, and you then have file transferring abilities without using mstsc! Here is an image to explain what I mean further: 

I'm currently doing something similar on my Windows 10 machine; however, I'm not using VMware, I'm using Virtualbox. I'm really only addressing the file sharing between the Windows 10 host and Ubuntu Virtual Machine. I created a share on Windows that had Read/Write access for the default windows user "everyone" on my entire network and then installed Samba on Ubuntu. I then had to make sure that the VM had its promiscuous mode set to "allow all" and set VirtualBox to use a bridge network adapter, so that the VM would be on the same network as the rest of my computers pulling an IP address from my DHCP router. Just to note: If you're using a GUI with Ubuntu, you should just be able to go to the Network tab of Ubuntu file manager and connect to the Share from there rather than having to manage and install software from the terminal. If you're using the terminal, then you will need to install samba and change the "/etc/fstab" file to connect to the share on boot. 

I bought a bluetooth keyboard for $13, and it's pretty good except instead of the Esc key, there's a little square and it opens up Internet Explorer when it's pressed! I've tried 3 key remapping programs, and NONE worked, they either say that the key is not supported or it's disabled... I have no idea what to do, I am a gamer so the Esc key is crucial for me. This is a picture of it: 

I ended up remapping the Caps Lock key with the Esc key since nothing was recognizing that Home button key. 

I am going to shift away from the RAM performance to battery performance. I have a Macbook Air laptop and I use it mostly for school. It has 2GBs of RAM and it pretty smooth when doing tasks on it. It starts to freeze up after the battery drains to about 10% and becomes almost unusable. The performance would be almost the same. It also depends what you do on your computer. If you are a hard user, a laptop probably won't suit you, however if all you do is check your e-mail, then a laptop or even a tablet would be perfect. A laptop is usually just a miniature desktop with some limitations like power.
