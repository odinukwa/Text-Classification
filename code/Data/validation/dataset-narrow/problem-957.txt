I know there are some commands I may have to run to better calculate the way the disk space is used, so if you need more information, please just ask and explain what I have to do to provide that information. Thank you! 

The total amount of space that my server has is ample for my operations; however, it is partitioned rather oddly (or perhaps normally â€“ I'm not a guru with this type of stuff yet). I am Minecraft servers on machine, for example. I currently have all of my technical data for my Minecraft servers saved to for all of my files. One file, for example, reaches up to 67GB, and it is increasing. The currently volume that it is in has 90GB allotted there, which is only a fraction of the my total hard drive space on my machine. My question is, how can I better maximize the way I am using my hard drive space on my dedicated server so I don't have to worry about running out of room when the time comes? Is there an "easy" way to do this, or will it result in a total reworking in the file structure? Here is an overview of the disk, if this helps any. 

My problem is that I am trying to set my domain's nameservers to the nameservers of my dedicated server. My domain is hosted by Namecheap, and everytime I try to input the two nameservers for my private server, one of them is rejected for being unregistered. 

My dedicated server's control panel is managed through Parallels Plesk 11.5, and the nameservers provided to me are one from the actual provider, OVH (sdns1.ovh.ca), and the other is an actual unique nameserver that points directly to my specific dedicated server. Previously, for another domain I own, I was successfully able to get Namecheap to take the nameserver without an error, so I know this is possible. I know that it works for one of my other domains. After being redirected by Namecheap to contact the server provider, I called OVH and they said it was something I would have to do myself. One interesting detail the OVH representative mentioned was that he saw that my port 53 was closed, which is the port that handles DNS. The only problem is that I have no idea or knowledge as how to open this port back up. So, my final question is how can I get this nameserver working in Namecheap to point to my dedicated server? If you need any more details, feel free to ask for clarification. 

I have a feeling there is some sort of issue with my graphics card, because I am VERY new to Linux and I'm unsure about what I may need to properly be able to run games. Below, I have some of the numerous packages I have tried to install during this process. 

The issue I was having was that I had not installed the apache2 web server to my dedicated machine, and the script that Multicraft was wanting me to execute expected the script to be located in , which at the time, I was not aware of. To fix my problem, I first installed apache2 by doing , and then I typed . After this, my web server was online, and I reexecuted the file. Upon doing this, Multicraft placed the front-end files in the web directory for apache2, and I was successfully able to finish the installation. 

I have an OpenVPN server running on a VPS I rent out from Atlanta. It is running CentOS 7 and is using the latest version of the OpenVPN Access Server software. I want to set up my VPN inside of the NetworkManager GUI provided in GNOME (Fedora 21). However, I do not know where to retrieve the needed information (nor do I know what the needed information is) to successfully get it working inside of GNOME. Currently, I connect to my VPN by opening a terminal and running . I would like to use it inside of the GNOME interface as shown here. 

This instantly alarmed me, as I was not aware of anything that would have triggered this to happen or cause me to run into an Error 500. When I consulted the providers of this specific web panel, they told me it was either because the MySQL database that the web panel was dependant on had been cleared or there was some other kind of issue with it. This instantly concerned me because I had not done anything to MySQL after the installation, and I hadn't even bothered with it since installation. After running into this issue with the Multicraft panel, I immediately logged onto my Parallels Plesk 11.5 server, where I was greeted with the following. 

The "Not enough disk space" was new to me and I had not noticed it before this point. Around this time, I was also having some minor issues with MySQL in Plesk, so I figured I would try out a reboot to see if it would be successful; however, after the reboot, I was greeted with the following error when connecting to my Plesk server afterwards: 

As a prenote, I am extremely new to networking in general, and my knowledge is very minimal, even for things you guys would consider basic. I will try my best to keep up with any advice you have to offer. Before I describe my issue, let me go ahead and establish my hardware/software: Hardware 

Firstly, before I explain my problem, I have referred to the question previously asked on Ask.Fedora about the libGL error, which can be seen here. I have been trying to play the game "FTL", and I have been running into problems where the graphics perform extraordinarily poorly, and the sound keeps turning into a strange buzzing sound. Upon looking further, I noticed that my Terminal outputted the following message during the game's launch. 

After doing some further research, it would appear that this issue has affected multiple people on numerous distributions of Linux, all with different solutions. Below, I have provided as much information as I can to help diagnose my specific issue. This also seems to be similar to Bug 971437 on the Red Hat bug tracker When getting libGL debug info on glxinfo: 

Thanks to a Reddit post, a user found that the issue was with v2.4 of . Downgrading to v2.3 via dnf immediately resolved the issue and I was able to connect. I plan on reporting this as a bug to the wpa_supplicant team soon. 

So, I then created those last two partitions intended for Mint. I then proceeded with the default installer for Mint Linux. When reaching the partitioning stage, it didn't recognize that any other operating systems were on the system, which I thought was odd. I realize now I think this was because of UEFI with Secure Boot still being enabled. Anyways, I set up a custom partitioning, with /dev/sda8 being the intended partition for Mint. However, I didn't realize it at the time, but I installed GRUB on /dev/sda8 instead of the Master Boot Record, so GRUB was never the default chooser on startup. After finishing the installation, we then installed EasyBCD to make Linux Mint bootable, since I didn't realize I just screwed up in choosing where to install GRUB. We added a custom record for the Mint partition, and this is where things began to go horribly wrong. We rebooted the computer and were greeted by the Windows Boot Manager with two options: Linux Mint and Mint Linux. Both options resulted in the general "Windows is corrupt, insert install media to repair computer, blah blah". We realized then that something was horribly wrong. I inserted the Linux Mint USB again and forced the computer to boot from the USB, and once I was back in, I realized that I had messed up completely on the installation. I reinstalled Mint over the old /dev/sda8 and this time installed GRUB on the MDR. So, now I was at least able to boot the computer into Linux Mint. So, now the problem we're facing is that we are unable to reboot into Windows. In GRUB, I have the option to boot Mint or the Windows Boot Manager, and the Boot Manager just repeats the same issue that we were having before. We have tried installing Windows XP onto a flash drive to try to remotely change EasyBCD settings; however, the program needed to make a XP flash drive, Rufus, does not work on anything but Windows... we don't have any Windows computers available. Is there any way to remotely repair the Windows Boot Manager to safely recover and reboot into Windows 8? The ultimate goal is to prevent any data loss and to successfully boot back into Windows. Any help is appreciated!
