Half duplex implies that there is a shared medium (in this case the radio spectrum) that is capable to transport one data flow. Usually when an host wants to transmit over a shared medium has to run an algorithm to ensure he is the only one that is transmitting to avoid collisions. In the wi-fi world the alghoritm is the CSMA/CA. When an host "wins" the channel he transmits at the full bandwidth of the channel. What you've described better fits in the Time division multiplexing (TDM) that is not really an access method but is a multiplexing one. 

all the vlans will be allowed in the trunk link. If you want to control which VLANs are allowed in a trunk link use the following commands: 

One of the most notable feature of NetSnmp is the possibility to extend an OID tree running aribtrary commands using the extend and the pass persist methods. I was wondering if there is such a fuature also in Cisco devices. For example is possible to answer with the hitcout of an ACL? Is so, how to choose the OID? To my knowledge there is not a private branch for custom OIDs. 

I have a single router connected to 2 ISPs..each on their own interface running BGP receiving a default only. Hosts on the inside interface and being translated to ISP1 and going out that interface as that default is installed in the RIB. When ISP1 dies, all NAT traffic drops and does not go out the ISP2 interface. Is this due to the current nat translations are using the ISP1 interface and need to timeout before being able to create new nat translations using ISP2's interface? Any info on this? EDIT: ASR1002 Image: asr1002x-universalk9.03.16.02.S.155-3.S2-ext Unfortunately don't have any logs from the incident as it happened a week or so ago. I'm just trying to understand how NAT translations work when there are multiple ISPs/interfaces involved. Current nat config: 

Anyone know if I need to change anything to get it to work properly? Keep in mind this is not regular vrrp. Thanks UPDATE If I have both vrid's enabled but disable one of the interfaces, then things work again. Not sure if it's related to spanning tree but it might be. The brocade switches are running 802.1w and the access switch is a cisco running rapid-pvst. Here is some output with the interface on Brocade1 disabled: 

As Network administrators we can modify the bridge priority value. When VLANs were introduced the needing of differentiating the STP protocol raised (Per VLAN Spanning Tree - PVST). To accomplish this the bridge priority value was modified as follows: 

But as you pointed out why an host would use the broadcast address in an ARP reply? Maybe because this could seem clever: using the L2 broadcast address all the hosts in the LAN would immediately know a new (IP,MAC) pair saving time. Actually this method is not desired by the RFC (even if they refer to periodic broadcasting): 

Doing troubleshooting with comments it turned out that the pre-shared key was missing on the router. To add this just type: 

If you want to achieve a more granular specification you could even think using NetFlow but this represents a more complex scenario. If you need suggestions about products please use the chat. 

Let's say I have a /27 allocation from my ISP, and let's call it: 90.10.200.32/27 The ISP have their router set up as my gateway on address 90.10.200.33. The range 90.10.200.34-62 are free for me to allocate. I need to add a routed subnet behind this network, that is reachable from the internet. Can I do this by dividing my prefix? Something like this: 

For the most control over your networking environment, I'd say get your own switch and router in the rack and have the ISP assign you a new public IP for your office only. But then, it really depends on your needs. 

But when I do so, I get large amounts of TCP retransmissions and duplicate ACKs when clients from the other end of the tunnel tries to route through R1, and performance is obivously very low. What am I missing? Is it simply not possible to do something like this, where R1 is both a default gateway, and provides the VPLS interface? Will I need to use another router to terminate the VPLS connections? I should note that the VPLS tunnel itself is working as expected, as is any client that is connected directly to S1 and using R1 as a gateway. It is only when R1 is connected to S1 both via the normal interface and the VPLS interface that things go awry. 

Reference: Private VLANs Actually if you have a look at the structure of a Subset Advertisements packet in VTP v2 (used to annouce the VLANs) you won't find any option to announce a "private" VLAN. So it seems more an unsupported feature rather than a design choice. Reference: Understanding VLAN Trunk Protocol (VTP) At the end it seems that this feature is avaible with VTP v3 

Pay attention that if you want to add a vlan on a trunk link (for example VLAN 100) you have to use the add statement (this is really a commond mistake), for example: 

When you read "Vlans allowed and active" it simply means that just the active VLANs (the ones you have defined) are allowed in that trunk link. Reference here: How to define the VLANs allowed on a trunk link EDIT: Analyzing the output of the command it's easy to see that it is organized in 4 sections; 

Anyone know how I can get this to work properly and so that once the PC's get a lease, they will be able to browse the internet, etc? Thanks UPDATE I made the following changes and now the PC is able to get a lease. added a new vlan and put port 17 into it along with creating a new ve instance 

I have 2 foundry devices running 802.1w which are both connected to an access switch which also runs 802.1w. The 2 foundry's are connected to each as well. I have the vlan configured on each of the devices to participate in spanning tree however when I add the tag/trunk ports to the vlan, the end devices configured on the access switch lose connectivity. As soon as I remove the tagged ports from the vlan either on switchA or switchB, the connectivity gets restored. It's not making much sense to me why it doesn't work when the tagged ports are added to the vlans. SwitchA vlan config: 

If you are interested in a more general method for troubleshooting refere here: Troubleshooting RADIUS and TACACS+ 

The really first step is to look for Radius support. With Radius support you are able to manage the authentication authorization and accounting (aaa). In this case you are not concerned with authentication and authorization since you are, essentially, asking for accounting. Accounting is the process by which a network device (called NAS - Network Access Server in the Radius world) periodically sends accounting messages to the RADIUS server (the aaa server) about the activity of its clients (the supplicants). For example an accounting message could transport information about how many bytes are beeing transmitted by the client during a session and so on. The really general idea is to have this schema: 

In the spanning tree algorithm the process of determining the root bridge is based on the bridge priority (BID). When there were no VLANs (meaning that switches had to deal with only one broadcast domain) the BID was equal to: 

I connect a router to the ISP network and give it the address 90.10.200.34/28, and set it's gateway to 90.10.200.33 I configure another interface of the route for the address 90.10.200.49/28, and connect devices to this interface, assigning them addresses in the 90.10.200.50-62 range. 

I have a router, R1, that is serving as a default gateway on a network segment. Let's say port eth0 has an ip of 10.0.0.1/24 and is connected to a switch, S1. Another port on the router, eth1, is part of a VPLS running over an MPLS network. I would like to connect to other end of the VPLS network to S1, so that the network clients on the other end of the tunnel can use R1 as a default gateway, so the setup looks like this: 

There is several different approaches you could take. The best solution depends on your needs. In my answers I assume that your office has wall-mounted ethernet sockets, that currently connect directly to the central switch(es).
