I have been at this for 2 days, been through countless forums and tutorials as far as configuring my ASA-5505. I can't get out to the internet (even using ping from the ASA), I can't "see" the ASA on the network .. Basically it's a dead piece of hardware other than the Console. My modem has been set to bridged mode as well. This is the tutorial I followed: HERE.. Not sure where to go next .. The "outside" vlan seems to be misconfigured, and I've tried so many permeations, that I am sure I am overlooking something major, and obvious. When I am able to ping 8.8.8.8, from the ASA, I'll be happy! Here are my Comcast settings: 

I think being layer 3 is an issue? Not sure? Any help achieving what I am looking for would be appreciated! also notice there is a VPN site-to-site tunnel set up. The configuration cannot interfere with that. 

I am unsure as to how to accomplish this, after searching for similar solutions, I have yet to come across a solution that is like what I need. The reason I want this done, is we have 30+ PC's that receive their IP's dynamically, including phones, pads etc ... However we have a few static devices, such as a few windows servers, printers and a few other devices that are intended to be static. Here is my current configuration, so that you might better understand what I have, vs. what I am attempting: (I will be filtering sensitive data, but will attempt to leave most of the config intact) 

I am working with an ASA-5505. I am trying to set aside a set of 10 IP addresses. Currently I have internally 10.1.10.100 - 254 set for my current vlan -- , and all equipment attached is receiving it's IP via dhcp from the ASA. I would like to reserve the group for static IPs .. For servers, equipment and whatnot. Is it possible to to this on the ASA? Would I have to set up a separated vlan on it's own switch? I have googled and googled, however I cannot piece together exactly what I am asking. Is it possible to reserve these IP's from the dhcp so they don't get leased out and possibly change/conflict with other appliances on the network? Any help appreciated from this networking noob.. 

This is slightly irritating, however I am assuming that it's something pretty simple.. Any ideas out there? 

Link I said, I am probably missing something critical and obvious, however having a development background networking is a somewhat foreign concept. 

I had just enabled site to site VPN access ... I am assuming something got messed up with NAT ... It's the strangest thing .. I cannot find anything wrong through ASDM, or CLI .. Yet, I can ping out of the network, and pings are received by host, replied to, and then blocked by the ASA. I can get out, but no return traffic .. Here is my config: 

All routers within an OSPF area keep a link state database (note that this is completely separate from the main routing table), where they're aware of all other routers and their links within the area. Each router within the area builds a topology tree of the area, with shortest paths to all other links/routers with itself as the root. This last part is important. When an area grows large, the link state database (the tree or topology) that each router must maintain also grows large. This means that it can become more and more intensive for the router to process link state (topology) changes as there are now a large number of entries in the link state database. The tree grows larger and is more difficult to "keep up" with as there become more and more branches/leaves of the tree. Something else to keep in mind is that as the area (network) grows larger, there is greater potential for link state changes, and thus a greater potential for recalculations of the link state database. While the details of which are somewhat "out of scope" of this answer, the OSPF link state update process is also relevant here. Ultimately, as a single area grows larger and larger, the SPF recalculations themselves will take longer to complete, and you have more risk of those SPF recalculations happening due to various reasons - the moral of the story is your routers' CPUs will be sad. The "advantage" of OSPF areas is that they provide a means to alleviate the demands placed on the routers if they were otherwise in a single area, by way of cutting down entries within the link state database and pushing responsibilities of the link state database maintenance to area border routers for their respective areas. It allows for a way to keep the tree size manageable. Thorough thought and planning is mandatory for designing/implementing multi-area OSPF - there are a number of situations where poor design in multi-area OSPF can bite someone. Using areas doesn't necessarily increase the "speed of communication" but it can have significant performance benefits (if done properly) to the routers in your OSPF network, especially if your network is very large, because their CPU's aren't having to work as hard. 

This could very well be an issue with the SNMP implementation of your device (which you've given us zero information about by the way). It would be useful if you could edit your original question to include this information, as well as output from against the table. Also, you could try doing an against to see if you get results from that. 

I've been spending the last week or so troubleshooting some (maybe related, but probably not) issues with Quagga. I have a test router - 7204VXR-NPEG2 running 12.4(24)T6 - with a single BGP session to a Quagga host. The only BGP session on the 7204 is with the Quagga box. This is an eBGP session. There is literally zero policy configured on either side, yet I get this without fail in output: 

Sorry for the long post. I tried to make it small but couldn't make it any smaller. Any help would be really appreciated. It would be great if you can explain from the basics. In the book "Computer Networking A Top-Down Approach" the following is written: "One important characteristic of cable Internet access is that it is a shared broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the head end travels down- stream on every link to every home and every packet sent by a home travels on the upstream channel to the head end. For this reason, if several users are simultaneously downloading a video file on the downstream channel, the actual rate at which each user receives its video file will be significantly lower than the aggregate cable downstream rate. On the other hand, if there are only a few active users and they are all Web surfing, then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full cable downstream rate, because the users will rarely request a Web page at exactly the same time." I am getting totally confused by this, as I am having problems figuring out how exactly does broadcasting work in the case of cable networks. It is said that every packet sent by the head end travels downstream to every home. Now suppose the Cable Head End is transmitting a packet with, say, ContentX, and suppose 10 homes are connected to it. In this case 10 ContentX packets will be sent through the link, and each home will get one. But suppose 3 homes are simultaneously searching for Content1, Content2 and Content3 respectively, and the rest of the homes are inactive. In this case the Cable Head End will broadcast packets of Content1, Content2, and Content3 to each home. Which means, there will be 10 Content1 packets, 10 Content2 packets, and 10 Content3 packets in the network (as every packet is broadcasted to all users). So, shouldn't the downstream rate in this case be even lower (because there are more packets to be sent in the same available bandwidth, there will be congestion) than the time when everyone is trying to download the same video because, no matter what, the Cable Head End will transmit the video packets to every house? So, its better if everyone is asking for those broadcasted packets itself rather than asking for different packets. I can feel that it is intuitively wrong to imagine that the downstream rate would be higher in case of many active users, rather than a few active users. But please help me figure out what is it that I am not getting here. P.S.: In case of packet switches, if a packet arrives at a broadcast address, the switch makes copies of the packet and sends out through all the outgoing links. So, it there are many such broadcast requests arriving at the switch, the switch will have to make copies of packets for each of those requests and that would overload the network and ultimately reduce the content download rate at each host. This is what I think will happen. Why does the opposite happen in cable network?
