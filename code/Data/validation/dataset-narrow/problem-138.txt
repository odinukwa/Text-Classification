Remember that all routers in the OSPF area need to have the same LSDB to ensure accurate routing knowledge. The update indeed has to spread. RFC2328 states it as one hop at a time "A Link State Update packet may contain several distinct LSAs, and floods each LSA one hop further from its point of origination" 

Steps taken from SRX650 Services Gateway Hardware Guide, you can also see the sampling of the above steps if in doubt. System default security Deny all transit traffic. 

Withing your AS if you have link redundancy and the peering IP is reachable via IGP then you shouldn't have an issue. If by this you mean to routing traffic from one group to the other through the ISP there shouldn't be an issue as well as long the ISP is aware that certain routes are not available over the interface where it is receiving it, so if you are advertising for example a /16 summary then you will probably have issues as the ISP will determine in it's table that the shortest path to that network is directly connected. 

The first thing that jumps out at me is that you appear to be shaping everything to 4 Mbps. I imagine that the rate changes on routers/sites with different circuit speeds, but you generally want to avoid shaping when dealing with latency-sensitive applications like VoIP and RDP as it can cause excessive buffering and jitter during periods of congestion. Also, the command is a bit tricky: Each instance actually allocates n% of the remaining available bandwidth, not n% of the total. This graphic from an article by Arden Packeer should help illustrate the idea: 

Your VLAN configuration shouldn't be causing any issues. I'd check for a duplex mismatch on one of the involved ports. 

Does anyone have any clever tricks around this? We could certainly use a separate user account instead of root, but that still leaves open the possibility that someone will log in as root during a maintenance action and forget to log out. 

Is there a way to filter the control plane of the firewall so that these packets are dropped at the interface edge rather than processed and rejected? This would be done with a simple interface ACL on a Cisco router or ASA, but I'm not sure how to go about this on ScreenOS. 

Link-state Database: Total compilation of routing knowledge. Consist of tuples (router ID, neighbor ID and cost). Candidate Database: Tuples are evaluated. It deletes "any tuples whose neighbor ID is currently in the Tree DB and whose cost to the root is greater than the entry currently in the tree database." (Adv Junos Service Provider Routing, Ch2-44) Tree Database: Loop free and lowest cost topology. 

Factory default security policies Trust to trust permit, trust to untrust permit, untrust to trust deny 

Router LSA consists of the standard LSA header plus the following below (I will purposefully omit some which don't matter in regards the concern): 

Finally got my hands on PT version 7. Yes indeed as pointed out by @Zac67 check the serial ports. From the file you shared and after changing serial ports IP subnet it will still not work. If you check both routers none display the letter 'R' for RIP routes in "show ip route", yet when you run "show ip protocols" it does say RIP is advertising for both subnets, it is even reflected when running the debug. If you check both routing tables, both see 10.0.0.0/8 directly connected. For some reason RIP is not liking this fact when updating the route sent from the other peer. Split Horizon seems to be the key because they are both advertising the same subnet 10.0.0.0/8, and as you know, this would create a loop unless a loop prevention mechanism takes place. Anyways I changed the subnet from the other set of PC's to 192.168.4.0 , added RIP as version 2 and it worked. The following link you can download the modified version of the lab. 

I typically set up such DMZ switches with a dedicated management interface with layer two access to the inside network, so that management access bypasses the firewall entirely. Since the 2950 does not have a dedicated management interface, you could simply designate a separate VLAN for management, configure its SVI, and assign to an access port which connects to the inside network. This ensures that you will have access to the switch in the event of a firewall failure for troubleshooting. (Note that Internet access from the switch will go through the inside network, the firewall, and pass back through the switch itself; it will not have direct outside connectivity.) 

I need to set up a modest iSCSI SAN with a few ESX hosts and one storage array. Can I get by using a Catalyst 2960-S or do I need to upgrade? Are there any special tweaks I need to make to the switch in order to handle iSCSI? The switch will be dedicated to the SAN; no other traffic except management will be present. 

However, traceroutes to all of the statically-learned routes timeout across the MPLS path and pick back up only at their last hops: 

There can be overlapping routes which will cause connectivity issues. Usually a router will pick the destination with the highest bit matching precedence, in other words the route with the longest mask. 

Four different Link Type's exist for LSA 1: - Point-to-point (Type 1) - Transit (Type 2) - Stub (Type 3) - Virtual Link (Type 4) 

I assume you just meant like any packet for which the MAC is not known. ARP (address resolution protocol) would take place for this matter. Below is a high level working of ARP operation. 

If you are a math type of person you may want to understand Dijkstra algorithm. Reading RFC2328 as mentioned by Ron is best option. If you are looking for a short down and dirty contribution I'll put it this way, yet feel free to dig links for in deep understanding. SPF does the calculation per-area basis on each router. Dijkstra algorithm evaluates 3DB's: 

Therefore, twice the time of the forward delay (listening time + learning time) contains all these parameters. The formula is: 

This process indeed takes effect with the usage of DBD packets as well as Type 3, 4 and 5 packets. let's see what each one contains: 

From router B, I can traceroute to both of the directly connected networks on router A with no problem: 

It's important to note that any classifications you define need to match what your WAN provider supports. Most providers offer only a handful of pre-configured QoS profiles from which you must choose which best suits your needs. You can classify however you'd like on incoming traffic at the WAN edge, but the provider's QoS controls are what control the the treatment of traffic during transit across the WAN. 

This looks like a simple layer two domain. MPLS is typically used only as backbone or distribution transit, that is, among routers. To implement MPLS, you would need to push the VLAN interfaces down to the access switches (and thus split Host5 into a new network or move it to switch 2) and run MPLS among the multilayer switches. Although, this wouldn't bring much benefit to the topology shown. 

I've been looking at a hardware network tap like this one to replace a pseudo-permanent SPAN that's been running on a Catalyst switch. All the taps I find have four interfaces: A, B, and two output ports (one for each direction). Ideally I would prefer to funnel the traffic from both directions into one cable so I only have to capture from one interface. Why do taps always seem to have two output ports?
