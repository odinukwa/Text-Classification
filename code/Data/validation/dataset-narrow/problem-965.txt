Where do you plug the ethernet cable into? Is it a switch/router that only supports 100Mbit/s? If yes, then that's the problem. 

Additionally to Moab's answer, I suggest to not unplug the printer's power cable. Most devices will do a self-test, wasting lots of ink, when the power was interrupted. The cost of the power consumption in stand-by mode, is nothing compared to the cost of the ink that's wasted during avoidable self-tests. I read this some time ago in the German "c't" magazine. 

I have a VirtualBox VM that is located on a network share of my NAS. When I copy something from the VM's disk onto another of the NAS' network shares (so the data is visible outside the VM), the Windows 7 Task Manager shows only incoming network traffic (yellow graph). It's as if the data was only received but never sent over the network. I verified that the data arrives on the other network share. As I understand it, the data flow looks like this: 

tcptrace is quite powerful and is probably able to do the things you want. Maybe it's a bit too low-level though... 

Hit CTRL+F and enter then hit Enter and Escape Start recording a macro (CTRL+SHIFT+R) Press Delete 3 times (once for linebreak, twice for tabs) Finish recording the macro (CTRL+SHIFT+R again) Hit F3 to search the next occurence. Execute macro (CTRL+SHIFT+P) Continue with Step 5 until all occurences are replaced. 

delete the logical OSX partition, move the Linux and swap partition forward, decrease the size of the logical partition, create a primary partition for OSX at the end of the disk, restore the backup of the OSX partition into the new OSX partition 

I frequently need to swap one file with another, without overwriting the original. Let's say there are two files, and . I usually rename them the follwing way: 

This is ok for a single file to swap but it becomes tedious when swapping multiple files at once. Is there a Windows (7 and preferrably XP) utility or a technique that simplifies this task and works well when swapping multiple files? I'd prefer to be able to use it from within FreeCommander but Windows Explorer would be ok, too. 

This will get you a primary OSX partition. I'm not familiar with the OS so maybe adjustments to its equivalent of a boot manager and /etc/fstab have to be made in order to reflect the new partition numbers. To keep your Linux system running, you may also have to account for the changed partition numbers of the Linux and swap partition. 

Are you sure, that it's a software problem? You could verify this by pressing the eject button while the system is booting up. Or boot up a from a Live-Linux (from USB stick) and test it. If it doesn't work either, your eject button may be broken. If it's really a windows problem, try booting in fail-safe mode and see if it works then. If the button works then, the problem is an application that runs in normal mode but not in fail-safe mode. Try to run with as few applications as possible running at once in normal mode. Maybe some CD/DVD writing applications are blocking the device. You could try to disable/uninstall those, too. 

If you have local admin privileges on your machine, you should be able to get rid of the other user's directories by yourself. Instead of deleting, you should zip them and put the archive(s) on your D: drive. If somebody wants their old files from your machine, you can make their user directory's archive available to them pretty easily. 

It's not really a log file and I only had a WinXP system to verify it, but I assume the behavior hasn't changed that much: The remote desktop application (mstsc.exe) on the local machine remembers the hostname/ip address of the last few remote hosts that one connected to. Just start it and then you should be able to see entries in the drop down list. Using this data, there is no way to tell when the login happened and it can therefore only give an indication. 

I definitely vote for using the new cooler. There is going to be more heat and that needs to be dissipated. Using a the old cooling system will sooner or later toast your new CPU. Higher temperatures definitely reduce the expected life time of the CPU. The problem that your new cooler doesn't fit into your case, can be addressed by buying a new case. They are not that expensive these days anymore. 

Do you mean lists of proxys you can use? A proxy doesn't care what browser you use so you don't need to search for "mozilla proxies". Unless you pay for your proxy account, it is very likely that using the proxies you find out in the wild is not exactly legal and slow. As Molly said, you really might want to have a look at Tor. 

Similar to Chris Nava's answer I also believe you need some kind of NAT. But maybe that's possible without plugging an extra piece of hardware (router) into your network: I found an article describing how to enable NAT for a container with private IP addresses. I hope that helps. 

It should only be able to install itself by using some sort of security hole. My guess is that you update Firefox whenever there are updates; right? If yes, you can quite safely assume that it hasn't installed itself on your machine. For the future you might want to have a look at the NoScript extension. It's targeted at advanced users but is generally a big security improvement. It would also have spared you those annoying JavaScript popups. 

Before Google Maps got its new "full screen" look, I could open a URL that looked something like this "$URL$ where was a string of the format "from: London to: Amsterdam". Together with the bookmark keyword feature of Firefox, I found this very efficient as it didn't involve mouse interaction nor waiting for the page to load before being able to enter something. This no longer works as Google now searches for a place called "from: London to: Amsterdam". I tried to adapt the URL to $URL$ and having the format "London / Amsterdam" but this gets expanded to $URL$ which makes Google search for the place "London/Amsterdam" instead of a route. TL;DR How can I achieve it so entering something like "map from London to Amsterdam" into Firefox's address bar and then hitting enter gives me a route from London to Amsterdam? I'm not tied to Google, though. Alternatives like Bing would also work as long as the calculated routes are usable for traveling by car. 

(The above is not the real MAC address; the real one is the one of my PC's NIC, not a VirtualBox network adapter.) Do you hava any suggestions on what could be causing the freezes and why they happen on Win 7 but not on Linux? Update: DHCP Server The DHCP server runs on my router (Netgear WGR614v9) and is configured to supply my PC always with the same IP address. I could not find any settings regarding the lease time. Another addition: The router is also configured to give the same IP address to the NAS device. The NAS only supports 100MBit/s and so does the router in between it and my PC (not an ideal setup but that's another story). So Gigabit-LAN and Jumbo frames are not an issue, either. 

Maybe your files for some reason have attributes that prevent them from even showing up in Explorer even though you told it to display hidden files. 

Have you tried $URL$ ? From what process explorer shows, it does not look like firefox uses any IRC specific ports but HTTPS. For other IRC networks, you could give $URL$ a try. I couldn't get it to connect to freenode because mibbit seems to be explicitly blocked there. 

Do a right-click into the window after making the selection. The selection box will disappear and the text will be in the clipboard. If you do a left-click instead, it will start a new selection and copy nothing. 

I have a virtual box disk on my NAS so I can use it from Windows as well as Linux. This works fine except on Windows (7) the VM sometimes freezes. The NAS (QNAP TS-109II) occasionally sends me an e-mail about the NIC link having being down but the VM freezes appear to occur more often than that. So I suppose, these events are not correlated. In the windows log there is a message from today at 7:15am. But I think the VM froze around 7:30 or even later.. This may have to do with it; but if yes, there must be some sort of delay between the events. 

I'd also say go ahead and use . has a better dependency management than . This will help keeping the count of orphaned packages low. I've read a while ago that has the better dist upgrade algorithm compared to . But that's hardly a killer feature as it's not used that often in the life time of a system. Additionally you'll have more stuff united in one tool. Rather than remembering when to call , or and with which switches I just use aptitude and get most things done. As for complications when switching "in the middle": I don't remember having had any when I did it. 

I'm not sure what search term to use and skimming through the VirtualBox manual didn't help me either, so I ask my two questions here... My setup is this: PC with dual boot into Windows 7 and a Debian operating system (both 64bit). I've created a virtual machine (Kubuntu, 64bit) under Windows and put it's VDI file on a SMB share of my NAS. Then I created a VM under linux using the same settings for memory etc and assigned the existing VDI file to it. My idea was that I could use that virtual machine from Windows and Linux as well. (1) Is this generally something that should work without problems? I noticed that snapshots get me into trouble because they appear to be not visible from the other operating system: The snapshots I took after installing the guest system are not visible under Linux. That's why I shut down the VM after usage and not save its state while it's running. My current problem is this: I have used the VM under Windows first, then under Linux. Now it will only start on Linux. When trying this on Windows the guest OS detects some kind of hard disk error and fails to boot because it cannot mount its drive. Obviously the virtual hard disk won't fail so it must have something to do with me using it under Linux. (2) How can I fix that? Update: It also looks like any changes I made in the VM under Linux have been reset by trying to boot it under Windows. Looks like it's back to the latest snapshot. I'm confused... Update The answer to my first question can be found below. In short: It works, as long as you don't use snapshots. The answer to my second question is this: Under Windows set the VM back to the latest snapshot and then discard the snapshot so it gets merged. There should be no snapshots left at the end. If you have multiple snapshots, discard the earliest ones first (Snapshot 1, then 2, 3, ...). I'm not sure what happens if you start at the end (.., 3, 2, 1). This of course leads to some data loss since you revert all changes since the last snapshot. But at least the VM is usable again. 

Note: If all your appearences are the same, you can also put the search into the macro (i.e. switch steps 1 and 2) and execute the macro until everything is on one line. Now you can do a search & replace with regular expressions (CTRL+H): Search for: Replace with:
