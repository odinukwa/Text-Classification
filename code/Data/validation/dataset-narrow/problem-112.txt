I have a FC switch from brocade with 16Gb ports and I want to connect to an array enclosure from another vendor. For internal requirements, it should be connected through twinax AOC cables. My problem is that all my cable suppliers only provide me "10Gb AOC cables" so I have a couple of questions: 

We have to understand your network to propose a different approach. Maybe you could get same results with PBF. Anyway, I think NAT it's the best approach. In this cases, I always use a 2 rule NAT in one of the peers (or reflexive policy in older PANOS versions). What's the problem with using NAT? Edit 1: I thought you just had overlapping network in both sides but onlye one networks wants to communicate with the other peer. The real scenario is that you have overlapping and you want communication between the two overlapping networks. This is a problem related with IP and not Palo Alto at all. In this particular scenario I can't imagine other solution than tweak destination IP and make a NAT in Palo Alto device. Or obviously, you always can change IP adressing on one of the 2 overlapping networks :). 

To complete previous answers, I will point out two practical scenarios where I have to access as root to JunOS recently. 

As a best practice, I like to define all "trunk" ports as hybrid ports in the Force10 terminology. In my opinion is more flexible, allow you to pass only the relevant VLAN taged and only one untagged. Just a reminder, Force10 don't like to usee VLAN 1 for production purpose. I always use a fiction "vlan 2" as default VLAN. Answering your question, try defining the port-channel as "portmode hybrid" and "switchport". About inter-vlan routing, it's enabled when you assign and ip address to the interface vlan. 

The thing is that you are not using the official Global Protect client so you need and extra configuration step in the firewall. You need to define X-Auth support (on the firewall) and all related fields. After that, you can use any SSL VPN Standard client. I confirm it works for me in Linux and IOS (the iphone thing, not the Cisco :P). This link would be quite useful for you. $URL$ 

Dell PC 28XX series don't support SNMPv3. If you are happy with v1 or v2, you can configure it via CLI (console) or via HTTP web (IP address). I suggest you CLI mode, it's really straight-forward. Just use config command "snmp-server community whatever" Source $URL$ As page 42 stated, the switch reboots itself when transitioning from unamanaged to managed. 

I don't know what you mean "FW01 and FW02 as a single entity". In most scenarios, the FW cluster are composed by 2 independent firewall talking via 1 o 2 HA links where one keeps active and other are standby. So, answering your question. Is this design correct? In my opinion, it's not valid. As @Ron stated in the comments, you can't port channel a device to two separate devices. If a firewall failover occurs, the redundancy will not work. 

You are mixing some concepts about HA, redundancy, port-channels and VLAN. Let's try to define every part of this network design. HA Firewall You need to conect 2 firewalls directly with one (or two) cables back-to-back for Control & Data. This consumes one (or two) ethernet ports in every firewall. This connection is just "a HA link". You don't need to define any special config about VLAN, addressing or nothing. Aditionally, you need to replicate exactly every cable in Primary Firewall and Secondary Firewall. I mean, if your FW1 X0 goes to VLAN 10 untagged in the core, you need to put FW2 X0 to same VLAN 10 untagged. WANs Tipically, every WAN connection has a cable from ISP device. But, remenber you need 2 cables for every interface in the Firewall. You need Layer 2 visibility for ISP Router, FW1-X1 and FW2-X1 (assuming default WAN). You can achieve this in several ways but 2 more typical: 

I have troubleshooted this in a real scenario. In Windows 7 with Wifi Intel driver, it just gets the first DHCP offer to arrive. 

You are designing a network with 8 switches. In my opinion, it's a network big enough to invest a bit more in a core switch with more 10GB links. Make a pure star topology with a core (switch 3) connected to each switch trought an etherchannel/port-channel (2x10GBx7 switches = 14x10GB). If you can't afford a core with 14x10GB, try to get a core with at least 7x10GB. Make a star topology with only one link per switch and get redudancy connecting each switch with another one (should be blocked by STP). If you are stuck to this Cisco model, you can't do much better. Just try to connect switch 1 to switch 3 directly and switch 5 to switch 7. As a best practice, try to not chain switches. As an opinion, at least, get a decent switch core ;). 

You need to have valid licenses to use Advanced Services as Content Filtering or App control. There are no alternative to this. Just check in www.mysonicwall.com what license do you have for your device. If your license are still valid, you need to resync or re-register the device. If your license expired, only option is renewing it (paying it of course :P) 

@Matthew you are on the right way. I have faced this exact problem in the past and I have used this command in S4810 devices. Unfortunately, I suspect this command is not supported in all Force10 Model. I just tested it in S60 and S4810 and it's working. You should check your model/version cli document. In fact, according to E-Series CLI, this command is not supported. Sorry about that. Anyway, a possible workaround would be use a third standadlone interface for PXE provisioning and then use port-channel for normal operations. 

Your security rule is wrong. The zone evaluation is POST-NAT. So, after applying NAT, your new IP packet have a source_zone=LAN and a dest_zone=VPN. However, you set WAN->VPN. Change the source zone from WAN to LAN and try again. (Using packet monitor would be also useful to troubleshoot the connection). 

According your last log, not even Phase 1 is established because both sides of tunnel got a timeout. I would suggest to make a packet capture to find where the packet is stopping. You should filter in each device with public ip as filter. I suggest three scenarios: 

All this NICs are related to LOM. If you add mezzanine cards to the server in the B and C slots, it just will repeat the pattern in the B and C switch. And for the extra mile...why are 17-32 ports? Well, in some scenarios you can use quad port cards in the blade. So you will have two extra ports mapped to the Te0/17 in the first server and so on until the blade16 mapped to the Te0/32 port. 

I understand that most of the CCTV traffic will be confined to the LAN under X6 traffic because communication is between your cameras and the recording device. Also, I understand that the only traffic that will flow throught X6 will be things like camera control, DNS, updating firmware, etc. I mean, there are no heavy traffic from CCTV LAN to the rest of Firewalls interfaces. If this two suppositions are correct, your firewall won't notice the new X6 LAN. If this two suppositions are incorrect, comment what it's different. 

After talking with my Brocade vendor, "there are no such thing as 16 GB FC AOC cable". Is have been a misunderstanding between Brocade FiberChannel and Brocade ethernet I mean, the communication in Brocade FC is always done with the chain Transceiver FC<->Fiber cable<->Transceiver FC at 8, 16 Gbps or whatever. In the other hand, the communication in Brocade ethernet can be done via with the chain Transceiver Ethernet<->Fiber cable<->Transceiver ethernet or alternatively with a single DAC/AOC cable whare each tail of the cable has to be compatible with the final device. @Zac67 thanks for your answer. I will accept mine because it's a bit more accurrate. 

Portfast is applied to final stations ports because you suppose that only one host will be connected. In this case, the host will go to Forwading state inmediately after getting link. If porfast is not applied, final station has to transition from all STP states (blocking, listening, learning, etc. Depends on STP version.). The consequence is that the host spend about 45 seconds to have connectivity. Is porfast causing the loop? NO but it amplifies consequences. The L2 loop will exist in both cases but with porfast enabled you will have immediately consequences. 

I recommend you to print page 4 of this document because it's a handy tool for troubleshooting. About packet flow in Palo Alto, check this grahp. In your case, points of interest could summarize as: 

About the second WAN, you just need to replicate the physical connection in other router/VLAN/FW port. Just remember that your are aproaching 2 different things: device/link redundancy with double cable to ISP and WAN failover using 2 differente ISP providers. Internal connections You have several LANs understood as "Users", "VoIP", "DMZ" and so on. Each of these LANS have a logical interface in the firewall. This is interface can be unique for the LAN (untagged frames from core to FW) or shared between LANS (FW subinterfaces and tagged frames from core to FW). In these two scenarios, you need to make again a double cable connection from FW to Cores. For example, if you use X0 for LAN_Users and your VLAN Users have ID 10. Then you need to connect a cable from FW1-X0 to a port in core as acces VLAN 10 and another cable from FW2-X0 to a another port in core as access VLAN 10. No need for STP because you are defining FW as L3 ports. The best approach in to try to plug every firewal in a different device BUT in the same forwarding plane. I mean, you can have a single device, a stack or a MLAG with VLT/VPC technologies. In the first case, plug the cable to same device. In the other two cases, distribute your cables to different switches. About port-channels, it's an extra link redundancy but in my opinion is unworthy to waste FW ports in this HA scenario. If a device/link fails, it just trigger a FW failover and you will work trought the other Firewall.
