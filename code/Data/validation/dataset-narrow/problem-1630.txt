which allow a a vertical mounting of the Pi (similar to a daughterboard or PCI card in your computer); 

The message indicates that the client and server can not agree on a secure connection mechanism. I have seen this with other VNC viewers. The simplest solution is to download RealVNC Viewer which is available for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X as well as IOS and Android. 

Move all of the pak files that were extracted from Q3 Demo Paks.zip over to quake3/baseq3/ using the mv command: 

This will sleep for 1 second, but you have not considered the amount of time the rest of your code takes to execute. say it takes 0.1 seconds. Every loop, therefore, takes more than a second to complete 0.1 seconds to run the code and 1 second of sleep time. As a result for every 10 or eleven loops, the code will have taken 1 extra second to complete - essentially skipping a second in your output. Also, there is some variability in the sleep function itself. You can read more about the precision of the sleep function in this question. You mention that this is not a major issue, I would add that most applications probably do not need to measure or log this info once a second. In terms of improving your code here are a few observations: 

Based on the above you have two problems file and directory ownership and odd file permissions. to correct this do the following: 

The first 26 pins (the number of pins on the model A and original model B Pi's) are the same. The model B+ and Pi2 have 40 pins. . The pins are numbered from left to right starting at the SD Card end of the board. The problem you will have is that the female pin header on the add on board, will likely not clear the 14th row of pins. There are a couple of workarounds you can use. 

to easily move projects around and keep them safe while working on them. A good place to pick these up is the dollar store or craft store. They come in a variety of sizes to fit any size project, they are clear allowing you to see what is inside, and have latches to keep them secure. I would not recommend hot glue or tape; glue can wreak havoc on a breadboard and tape leaves residue that can be hard to remove and can actually cause a static discharge. One thing I have used successfully is a small sheet of acrylic. You can attach your breadboard to it and it can be drilled to attach other boards and components. If you do this I would suggest getting some small rubber or felt pads for the bottom to avoid scraticing your work surface. 

You are logged in automatically as the Pi user with the default password. The reaason you can't copy a file to the /var/www/ directory is because you do not own the folder. To get around this do the following from a termianl window: switch to the directory where the file you want to move is located (assuming the file is in your home directory): 

A USB hub will likely not be enough to power 8 Pi's. The spec is for 500mA per port (USB 2) and 900mA (USB 3). I don't know of any hub that could supply 8 Amps (1 amp per port). All of the Pi cluster setups I have seen are using a multi device USB charger. I would suggest doing a google search for Pi cluster and looking at what they are using. One thing to note is since you are planning to use Pi 3s solutions using the Pi Zero, probably don't apply as they have lower power requirements. 

It is unlikely any one could provide a definitive answer based on a picture of a cable. Even if the look the same visually they could be very different internally. The best way to be sure is to buy from a reputable dealer and one that specifies it works with the Pi. You don't mention where in the world you are, but below are a couple of suggestions: The PiHut (UK) sells an HDMI to VGA adapater and adafruit (US) has two models standard HDMI connector and a mini HDMI connector. 

You can connect an LED directly to the GPIO pins (it will provide enough current). However, you probably shouldn't do this for a couple of reasons, You can fry the Pi as you state, and without a current limiting resistor you will signifcantly reduce the life of the LED. This does not mean you need to buy a breakout board to run a single LED. You can use a simple protection circuit to protect your PI. This article has a good discussion on protecting your Pi's GPIO from damage. If you plan to experiment beyond a simple LED a breakout board that includes GPIO Protection can be a good investment and time saver. 

You will have to reinstall the kernel. If you had already made a working PiTFT setup, you may be able to reinstall the Adafruit kernel like so: 

Right now you are looping as fast as the CPU can process the loop. Try adding a sleep to back off the CPU. It is unlikely that you need to check the motion sensor as often as you are 

This seems to be a problem with the noob release - previous versions would default to the composite video if nothing was connected to the HDMI port. To correct this do the following: 

The default Pi user can gain root level (superuser) access via the command, or to avoid having to reenter the password become the root user by doing and supplying the password for the user Pi (this method is not recommend as a typo can hose your system, and has negative security implications). The error message you receive when running the file 

There are pros and cons on both sides of this argument. On the one hand, by keeping your system up to date you insure that you have the latest bug and security fixes; on the other hand, by being on the bleeding edge you may become the victim of an unfound bug or security hole in one of the updated packages, which can prevent your system from working as intended. I choose to run the risk of an unfound bug, and have my Pi set up to automatically update using cron-apt. I also have etckeeper (note that these instructions are a little out of date and that installing etckeeper will default to using git and do an initial import for you) installed so that in the event I need to rollback and update I can do so without much difficulty. 

As for software you may need to be running a newer version of the Kernel and Firmware, like with the B+. Additional info can be found on the element 14 website, and from the raspberrypi.org site 

You could make a tweet a watt (option2). Alternatively, you could use a clamp on current sensor - as discussed on the Raspberry Pi forums (option 3) There are a couple of alternatives that you may not have thought about: 

The image you are describing is the Pi's way of telling you that it is not getting the required voltage. You should be powering the HDD from an external powered hub, not from the Pi directly. More info can be found in this thread. 

substituting your name and email in the above commands. You should then be able to git clone the repository with the following command: 

The prompt on most systems will also change to indicate which user account you are using. It will normally show the username (i.e. root or pi) and when operating as the root user the prompt will end with a # rather than a $. 

choose option 5 International Options Then I3 Change Keyboard Layout Next choose your keyboard model (there are generic choices if your keyboard is not listed - for example I use Logitech generic with my K400). Then choose the language and country (you may have to choose other first), finally click OK to select the default selection for the remaining options. Click finish and reboot. 

The problem is the breadboard (though some would call it a feature). The breadboard you have has split power rails (Marked by the red and blue lines on the edge of the board). If you look carefully the lines are not continuous from one end of the board to the other, but are split in the middle (this allows you to run two separate voltages). To solve your problem just add a pair of jumpers between the power rails, like the orange wires in this picture. 

The HDMI port on your laptop is an output. You can NOT connect the Pi to a laptop via HDMI and use the laptop's screen. However, you will need a screen and keyboard to configure noobs the first time. You can however, download Raspbian and burn that to your SD card. Unlike noobs Raspbian can be setup headless, using SSH. 

I am not sure if this is what you are getting at but compare the elinux image with the name and physical columns in the GPIO readall output. The readall output also includes the BCM numbering scheme (the actual chip that runs the Pi) and the wiringpi (a library used to access the GPIO pins) numbering scheme. The readall output also includes the pin mode (input or output) and its current value (high 1 or low 0). This thread $URL$ contains more info on the various pin naming schemes.exactly 

The first 26 pins are the same between the old and new boards. So physically they should work. There are a few caveats to that however:
