This has been a feature request in Ubuntu for a while now. As of yet their is no official support, but there is a work around: a) Export to PDF in OpenOffice. b) Use pdfnup to print multiple pages per sheet. 

I'm trying to install my wireless drivers (which uses a broadcom card). I tried to install them using the restricted drivers offered on my Ubuntu CD (since my only internet connection is public Wi-Fi). However when I clicked activate it got about halfway through the install process before it gave me this error message: 

So I have a Dell Inspiron 1526 that has a broadcom bcm4312 wireless card. I installed Ubuntu and (big surprise) the wireless card isn't working. No problem for a hot shot like me who has fixed this same problem before on my old laptop. Just install bc43xx-fwcutter and install the firmware, well it didn't work. Needless to say I've been googleing for more than an hour and I'm tuff out of luck. So how can I get this to work? Oh, one minor note: I don't have anyway to connect to the internet on said computer because all I have is wireless that is being pick upped from across the street (no ethernet), but I do have another computer that can connect. 

I have a laptop (Compaq Presario V5000). It's about 4 years old now. My dad bought it at Walmart on Black Friday for $389 (it only had 384MB of memory (now it has 2GB)). It has seen 3 Windows OS's and 4 Ubuntu's (I dual boot). The hard disk has begun to fail. I already have all the data backed up. I wouldn't say my computer is slow, but I wouldn't say its fast either. The processor is a Mobile AMD Sempron 3300+ which runs at about 2.0 GHz. The current tempature after being on for about 6 hours is 43 C (or 104 F). So I'm just wondering: 

I have the airline plugin installed for vim and no matter which theme I pick there is always an orange arrow in the bottom right corner of the screen. How can I fix this? 

Everytime I start Ubuntu I get a warning message that says my hard disk is failing. Big deal, it's just a warning, I'm a programmer, I ignore warnings (kidding). On a more serious note: I've already backed up all my data that I need, but I gonna continue to use this computer until it explodes dag napbit! So how do I tell Ubuntu that I don't care and make it stop showing me the warning? 

I'm just wondering if there are any unofficial Google Chrome Themes that I can easily install (eg. don't have to copy a .dll to the themes folder)? I would like to be able to click apply theme (just like you can on Google's Official Themes page). Do any exist? 

It is not possible to downgrade from a fresh Windows 10 install as you only have a license for Windows 10 and not Windows 8.1. The only time it is possible to downgrade is if you upgraded from a previous Windows installation. 

Such a tool does exist, it's called Timeshift. The linked article is about Ubuntu but it works for multiple distros. 

When opening/saving a file using GEdit you see a open/save file dialog. The default location to open/save files in is . Is there anyway I can change it so that the default open/save is ? 

It will turn my screen off, then back on. So I'm thinking that maybe my script isn't getting called. 

I recently bought a Lenovo IdeaPad Y580 and it has one minor annoyance: It continues to dim the screen when I unplug it from the power cord. I have tried setting the screen brightness in the advanced power settings but no matter what I set this to, the laptop always gets dimmer when unplugged. 

I want to have both of my scrollbar buttons at the bottom like the way it is on a mac. How can I do this in Ubuntu? I know some themes support it but I was wondering if there was a way to make this permanent for all themes. 

One way you could do this would be to create a folder full of shortcuts to these locations. Then pin the shortcut to the taskbar. Remember to change the shortcut icon before you pin it to the taskbar. 

I really hate the Google Chrome Dev warning that opens every time I use Google Chrome on Linux. Is there anyway to disable it. 

Create a folder in your home directory (ie. ) called and paste all fonts there. This should work since it's ubuntu based but I'm not 100% sure. 

I would try installing the Synaptiks touchpad tool. This solved my issue when my touchpad wasn't recognized on my laptop. 

It could be that one of the ports is USB 2.0 and the other is USB 1.0 or 1.1 USB 2.0 is the newer technology and it supports faster rates of transfer. 

Is there a way to hook up a standard DVD player to a DirecTV HD DVR and record the content to this disk? If not is there a way to record the content onto a computer to later be recorded onto a DVD. 

Which I placed in a folder called: and titled the script , but it doesn't seem to get called after standby. If I just type: 

I'm running Ubuntu 9.04 on a Compaq Presario V5000 (piece of crap) and when I try to resume from standby, it's forgetting to turn my screen back on. I found a bash script somewhere a long time ago that actually fixed this problem, but I can't remember where. So I was wondering if you guys could point me in the right direction or maybe show me how to write a quick bash script to do this. Update: I have tried the following script: 

While I'm not an expert, I think it's more likely that your new apartment has a power supply that fluctuates more than it should, and the monitor power supplies just happen to be particularly sensitive to voltage surges. I would suggest purchasing a surge suppressing extension socket as well as a new power supply, and connecting the monitor to the electricity supply through that. 

Just because you've set up a DNS A record for example.dyn.org to point at a static IP address that your router doesn't actually have, that doesn't mean that your traffic will magically start to originate from that IP address instead of your dynamic IP address -- it will have no effect whatsoever on your IP address as seen by other people's firewalls, it will just stop people from connecting to you using the hostname. 

For filesystems without the three-character extension limit, there's generally no limit on the length of the extension, only on the total length of the filename including the extension (e.g. 255 bytes for the ext3 filesystem used in Linux). 

I would purchase and use Emailchemy Forensic Edition to convert the OSTs into some format that can be grepped (I'd recommend Maildir), then write a shell script or Perl script or whatever works best for you in order to extract the relevant ones. Make sure you have plenty of disk space. 

To securely wipe a hard disk, open it up, remove the platters, incinerate them, and disperse the ash. There's no way to wipe a hard disk that both allows it to be reused and gives 100% confidence that no data can be recovered from it. 

MAC addresses are used at layer 2 to let machines on the same local network communicate with each other using Ethernet packets. IP addresses are the next layer up, layer 3, and allow machines to exchange IP packets with each other, which unlike Ethernet packets can be routed between different networks. IP subnet classes A, B and C no longer exist, having been replaced by CIDR variable-size subnets. When they did exist, the only difference between them was their size -- they had either 254 (class C), 65,534 (class B) or 16,777,214 (class A) usable IP addresses (assuming they were configured as a single big subnet, which classes A and B certainly would not be in practice). 

In theory, there is, based on finding the network latency between the IP address and a large number of routers with known locations. See this paper. I'm not aware of any commercial implementations, and it would be a lot of work to implement for yourself. 

With RSA, it is the case that messages encrypted with the private key can be decrypted with the public key, as well as vice versa. But that's not the case with all public key encryption, and is not required for digital signatures. What's required is that there is some pair of algorithms one of which can produce a signature using a private key and the other one of which can verify the signature using the matching public key. The exact implementation details of those algorithms are different for different protocols. 

If you're using Mac OS X, just open it in Preview and then use Save As to export it as a JPEG. If you're not on OS X, perhaps you could edit your question to provide a lot more detail about your environment -- what kind of Unix are you using, what distribution, what packages do you have installed, and so on. 

Sounds like a flaky DNS server. Your existing connections don't need DNS, so they're maintained, but you can't do DNS lookups to create new connections by hostname. To check this, look up an IP address for Google or something while everything is working OK (e.g. 209.85.143.99), and then when it goes flaky, try loading the Google home page by IP address ($URL$ If it loads OK, then it's a DNS problem. 

Zip doesn't just store the contents of the file, it also stores file metadata like the owning user id, permissions, creation and modification times and so on. If you have one file you have one set of metadata; if you have 10,000 files you have 10,000 sets of metadata. 

Try the following. It uses the fact that you can extract the daytime measurements to subtract the daytime element from the total, giving the overnight average. 

OK, it looks like either /var/lib/mysql doesn't exist or the mysql user doesn't have permission to access it. Either way, you have worse problems than having forgotten the root password -- either you don't have a database at all, or something has changed the file permissions or ownership. 

It depends on the exact capabilities of your router. If it lets you define multiple IP subnets, bind different ports to different subnets and route between subnets then it should all work as you've diagrammed it, but lots of consumer-grade ADSL routers lack this level of flexibility. You'll need to set the router's 192.168.1.x address as the default gateway for the 192.169.0.x subnet to give Internet access to that subnet. Be aware that 192.169.0.x is not in the IP ranges reserved for private networks by RFC1918, and you could get conflicts with public IP addresses in this range. You'd do better to use something under 172.16-31.x.x or 10.x.x.x for your second subnet. 

The easiest way is to go to the website of the printer manufacturer, and download and install their proprietary scanner software. 

There are the CrossOver products from CodeWeavers, which are basically more polished commercial versions of Wine. Or you can run a VM like VirtualBox and buy a licensed copy of Windows to run in it.
