If you have the luxury of adding another column to your worksheet, you can compress the list of dates in a new column. Then, use the new column as your validation list rather than the original dates from your formula. Example: Column includes random dates and blanks generated by the formula below (you won't use this formula). 

Finding functions for boundaries. You said your boundaries are based on scatter plot data. Presumably you already have these curves broken into pieces (i.e., different series). If so, you can use the option in your chart (right-click a point in your boundary series to see this option). Choose the appropriate model and display the equation on the chart. You'll need to note these equations for each series so you can use them in step 2. If your boundary lines are not broken into appropriate series for this trend-fitting method, you'll have to do the regression work yourself in Excel. Explaining how to do this goes beyond the scope of the question and this site. I suggest googling how to perform regression analysis in Excel. Setting conditions. Next to your data (for the green points in your example scatter plot), you'll want to add a column (or three) for formulas that tell whether the point is in the region. For your specific example, I'd use three columns: one to tell if the point is in the green region or L, another to tell if the point is in L, and a third to say if the point is in the first region but not the second. Your conditions will likely be dependent on the x-value of the datapoint. For your example, I would apply different conditions to x-values between 11.5 and 25.5 than for values greater than 25.5. Assuming your datapoints are defined in columns A (x-coordinate) and B (y-coordinate), here's a pseudo-formula you can use as a template. 

You must enter it as an array formula. Do so by pressing Ctrl.+Shift+Enter. The formula will appear as if done correctly. 

Step 2: Use INDEX and MATCH to look up the Personnel IDs for the names in your computer list. In a separate column on the sheet with your computer data, you can use a formula like the following to look up the ID for the Employee named in . 

Note: This sample looks a little funky because I used sparse data (20 records over a week) to generate the pivot table. It should look more like what you have in mind with your large data set. 

This code uses regular expression and dictionary scripting objects. It will find the user mentions in each tweet and store them in a dictionary. The dictionary is used to ensure uniqueness. Finally, the unique user mentions are printed in column A on a new sheet. 

Perhaps you could textually indicate the time range in a cell above the sparklines. A formula like the following might work: 

An array of the categories is the first argument of the function. If you want more categories, include them here, comma-separated, each wrapped in quotation marks. An array of the category range lower bounds is the second argument of the function. The number of values in the array should correspond to the number of categories. Each value is the lower bound of a defined category range. is the address of the value you are categorizing ( is the first value in your example data). 

It's a bit convoluted and will make your worksheet harder to audit, but it will get the job done. If you need clear, easy-to-follow formulas, VBA is probably the way to go. 

Fill over and down to fill your matrix. This will return the value of the ID at that date and 0 if there is no data available for that date. 

In this formula, hold your action codes, and are the associated dates. Example output (both solutions): 

Set an exception for values below the lower bound and let handle the rest. To do this, just wrap your function in an function. 

Now, select all your data again, copy it and > back into the same range. This will remove the formulas you just entered but will keep the values. Finally, with all your data selected, go to the Data ribbon and select . Remove duplicates based on column A (the column with values a and b). 

Enter with Ctrl+Shift+Enter. This will replace all numbers in your array that are greater than 60 with and then average them. 

where is the probability density function of X at x, and is the probability density function of Y at y. So, in Excel, if you want to find , the value of the joint density function for x and y, you can use the built-in function to get what you need. 

I haven't looked at the ZIP Code CSV, but I'm fairly certain you can use a VLOOKUP() formula that looks through that data. 

returns -1. In your particular case where the ranges you're trying to shuffle aren't contiguous, the syntax is read as . This is not a square matrix, so returns an error. If you want to find the determinant of that noncontiguous range, you'll have to recreate the matrix somewhere else on the sheet. 

When entered in a single cell, however, only the top-left value of the matrix is returned. The secret to this formula is that it must be entered as a single formula into a range the same size as the matrix. To do this, select an empty 4-by-3 range, e.g. . Without changing the selection, click in the formula bar and type the formula. Then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter. You'll see the full matrix of results printed in the range you selected. 

Here's a method using three helper columns. The idea is that you can then filter for rows with value in the third helper column to get the rows you want. First helper column (column in my example): Gives the count of "Apple" entries for that person. 

I think you're confused about what you're putting in . Here you will enter, as text, the address of a range. The content of the cell is a string, not a range. You will pass this string to the function by way of a range reference. will return the contents of X123. EDIT: Your comment made me realize you probably wanted something different. I think what you are looking for is a way to use an indirect cell reference as a relative reference, i.e. you want to be able to use the indirect reference to refer to one thing when used in A1, but to refer to something else (one column over) when used in B1. You can do this with a combination of , , , and . For example, contains a set of data, as does . In you have the address "A2:A11" stored as text. 

Copy the ID column to where you want your new merged table. Apply (on the Data ribbon) to the copied column. This will give you your column of unique IDs. Select the first blank cell to the right of the first ID in your new table. Paste the following formula into the formula bar and press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to enter it as an array formula. 

You can use one conditional formatting rule to do this. By defining the rule as a formula, you can use the following, where is the top-left cell in the range to which you are applying the rule:
