or . Restricted means that only the user and perhaps the web server can read it (e.g. modes / or some ACLs). Immutability can be done with or by changing the ownership to something like . An easy way to create that hierarchy on Ubuntu would be to edit and set to . 

I don't think you've generated the required certificates, therefore you're getting that error. So either generate the certificates or use another transport, for example tcp (unencrypted, good only for trusted networks) or ssh (e.g. ). 

CentOS doesn't have as many packages as other distributions and some of them are old, too. Add the EPEL repository and see if it has the necessarily packages. The python-reportlab and python-psycopg packages are available in the RPMforge repository. I would recommend installing packages from this repository only if they're not available in CentOS or EPEL. This can be done with yum-priorities. 

P.S. works fine for owner, group and permissions, but not for SELinux. If the partitions are already mounted, puppet complains: 

In case it matters, I'm using puppet-0.25.4-1.fc13.noarch.rpm and puppet-server-0.25.4-1.fc13.noarch.rpm. 

You didn't specify the transport and the default transport is tls. The documentation regarding transports also says this about tls: 

Secondly, not even this will work because ssh doesn't read the answer from stdin, it reads it directly from the terminal, so you'll need something like Expect: 

Use the PAM module called to set enviroment variables on login. If you use this solution, the environment variables will be available to GUI programs launched directly from the "Window Manager" (e.g. GNOME, KDE) too, not only to programs launched from a terminal. Also, the user can use another shell, not only Bash. Maybe this article from O'Reilly can help you. 

Official Support for the Debian distribution is not provided by Dell. However I have been running Dell Servers with various Debian versions for the past several years. They have been very good about supporting the Hardware. 

If you server is running some form of linux, try setting a ulimit on the user that generates the PDF's. 

This sounds like a Harddrive issue. Does this happen on all the laptops or just a few? Have you checked the Eventlog to see if there have been harddrive or hardware errors. One easy way to check and see if it's a hard drive issue would be to load up a Live-Linux CD and check for badblocks. Also I forgot to ask what type of hardware do you have for these laptops. That could be another factor to look at. 

What does show? Once you get the kernel names you can just Just make sure you do not purge your current kernel. The results can be unexpected. 

It sounds like there is some security that your system administrator setup. I would talk to your IT/System Administrators before you go trying to bypass the security they have put into place. There are a number of different setups that could be "blocking" you. 

I use Bacula, its free and open and works on Windows and Linux, and has extensive documentation on the linux and windows ports. As for Duplicati, I have never used it so I cant really tell you what do on that, but you that is an alternative. 

If you use Postfix, you can set the mailbox_command option to run your Python script on every message, but I think you'll have a lot of functionality to implement. Another solution would be to use procmail for local delivery and configure it to send (pipe) the messages to your Python script. This autoresponder example might help you. The advantage of this solution is that your script can be simpler. There's no need for it to be a full local delivery agent. 

I recommend the Fedora Live CD on a USB stick. It's not very small (it has 700MB), but it's easy to use and since it's a bit bleeding edge you shouldn't have any issues with new hardware or filesystems (although ext3 is already a bit old). 

then start Apache. Note: On the Fedora Linux distribution and probably others using systemd, some services don't see the mounts done after they were started because of some security features enabled by default. For more details read systemd for Administrators, Part XII. Also if using SELinux, the files need to have a proper label like for example. 

You could try making it harder to reset the permissions of the root directory by making it append only with chattr: 

This could be caused by hard links which means that the files you deleted still exist under other names. To find them, run . 

How about a plain ? After all most devices are just a file located under . LE: You need to do the renaming every time you boot. 

Depending on how you setup your Postfix you may be able to use an alias to forward all mail. edit Also you can setup a redirect that will do it for you easily. In /etc/postfix/main.cf add this: 

I dont know of a web interface to manage squid blacklists, but you may want to look at DansGuarding. It has a very good blacklist and can be edited to suit your needs. 

I have been using Raid1 on linux with write's way over 15M/S. Those log messages are indicative of either a hardware issue with the drive, a bad Sata cable, or a bad connection on the motherboard. Does SMART reporting show any errors with the drive. I would check that and the SATA cable. Easy cheap solutions if it is a hard drive issue. 

This is a bit of a hack but it will work for forwarding specific users from one domain to another. You also may want to look at this page for how to do some rewriting within Postfix it's self. 

Bind is trying to to resolve ipv6 addresses from an ipv6 server. Is your server configured with IPv6? 

I just check to see if the Currently Active slave has changed or not. Also if you are just looking to see if link is lost on one of your NIC's, you can still do that though SNMP or other standard forms of monitoring. 

Is there a way I can convert an MBR partition setup to a GPT partitions with out having to destroy all my data? Thanks 

Not exactly an answer, but I would recommend using SFTP instead of FTP. It's easier to setup given the fact that every box comes with the OpenSSH server and client. It's also more secure and SSHFS is nice bonus, although I don't know if RHEL has support for it. 

The manual for ST32000641AS (alternative link) says that the drive has 3,907,029,168 guaranteed sectors, while the specifications for WD2003FYYS (alternative link) say it has 3,907,029,168 sectors. Therefore the drives have the same capacity. 

The link needs to be created where you're building the RPM and it also needs to point where you're installing the RPM. Before creating the link make sure that the destination directory exists, i.e. . You can use or for this. 

Enable the modules. I suggest starting with the corresponding file underneath the directory (I used ). Prepare the kernel for modules: 

prints a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call in case it's needed later for extra performance analysis. traces child processes and it might not be needed. The output looks something like this: 

That's the whole idea, to use systemd (or upstart etc) inside a container. Docker is used most of the time to run a single service per container, so for a complex site you would need a container for the web server and another one for the database server. With a process manager you could run both in the same container. Which approach is better is opinion-based. Though from what I've seen running systemd inside Docker isn't easy as of June 2014, for example there's bug #3629 - "running systemd inside docker arch container hangs or segfaults". For more details also read "Running systemd within a Docker Container". 

You can host multiple SSL based sites. You have to use SNI, and not all browsers support SNI, so you can have issues with an older web browser. Most modern browsers should support it. It's described in RFC-6066 This HOW-TO can walk you though how to do it. 

This has happened to me in the past. It Have you tried Different ports on the switch and a different Ethernet Cable. I've seen where a bad cable will give you link but not show you have a good enough connection to the pins to keep the signal of proper quality for higher then 10/Half. 

Another service you can use is CAcert.org. They offer free SSL certs, you may want to look at them I use them for some of my certs. 

The issue is displayed in your netstat output. Mysql is bound to the loopback address. Check your /etc/mysql/my.cnf (if you are running Debian, or ubuntu) and change the bind-address from bind-address = 127.0.0.1 to bind-address = 10.10.10.99 Also I would make sure you have proper security and firewall rules setup to protect your mysql server. 

I'm using an asterisk VOIP server, and I'm able to make called though with my SIP client. The problem I get is one-way voice. I can hear the incoming voice but the caller can not hear me. I have no problems when using the X-Lite3 windows SIP client. I VOIP provider is broadvoice. Could it be something in the firewall rules that I need to fix? 

Install one system, boot it and check out the block layer statistics from e.g. . Quoting from the documentation: 

Short explanation of the AKW one-liner: is the PID, is the timestamp, is the remote port and is the remote address. The advantage of this solution is that root is not required if the server runs under the same user. The disadvantage is that all connections are counted, there's no filtering, so it won't work if the application listens on multiple ports. 

If the NS server don't have an A record how can BIND find out their IP address in order to query them? It can't, so it can't resolve domains served by them. On a side note I've run a test myself and I've noticed that I can resolve 10gb.co.il using the DNS servers of my ISP, but I can't by running (this uses the root name servers). Your issue is caused by an improperly configured domain. My guess would be that the DNS servers of my and your ISP have the address of 10gb.co.il in their cache, while the current setup of the domain is incorrect. 

Make the file immutable with chattr i.e. . Then no one will be able to change it, not even root, unless the attribute is unset. Note that only root can set or unset this attribute. 

Remove from the boot command line and start in text mode (runlevel 3) to have a better idea of what's going on. Then consider reporting a bug. P.S. It seems that someone else has already reported this bug. 

This is what I think the best option would be. First Connect the ASA5550's in a HA pair. Connect HA1 Inside/DMZ interface to Switch1. Connect HA2 Inside/DMZ to Switch two. Have the Failover monitor ALL interfaces that are active. Between Switch one and Switch two setup a 3 or 4 port LACP. Now this is also assuming that your ISP has given you two distinct connections that are in the same IP address space. Also you didnt say what version of ASAOS you are running. The Release notes for 8.4(1) stats they did introduce EtherChannel. They may be worth looking in to as well. 

You need to create a snapshot of the data and import that in to your slave before you start the replication slave. Typically that is done with mysqldump. On you master check "show Master status", and on your slave check "show slave status". That will give you any errors. And follow what quanta link you to. 

What you are creating is a third level domain. This should help a bit. DNS just converts the IP address computers talk into names humans can use easily. The reason you don't have to specify the NS server is pretty simple. You have already specified them for example.com. r.example.com is just pointing to a different IP address. 

It sounds like SNI is not enabled. That would explain why they all go to the same page. If you are running Debian Lenny or Debian Squeeze I believe that it will work. Check out this page It describes how to enable SNI on your hosts. Note this is used with NameBased Virtual hosts. From your configuration it looks as though you are using Named virtual hosts.
