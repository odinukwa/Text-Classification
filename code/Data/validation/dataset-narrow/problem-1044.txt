I have 2 old emachines and i have a problem where the CD/DVD drives do not open when i press the button or even a software eject. It makes a clicking sound like its locked. I smack the side pretty hard, and it usually will open then. If not, smack the other side. I'm not sure of this is your problem or not though. Does it make any sounds when you try to eject it? 

Dropbox is great for that, and yes it support symlinks. this new beta, might be a big help, with selective sync, to keep some files on only one computer. $URL$ 

depends on the software, Personally I've never seen a difference, except that different programs call it different things. What program are you using? 

Freenas is easy to setup, only needs like under 256 megs for the OS, runs a slimmed down FreeBSD with lighthttpd as a webserver. and the install is quick and painless. Can run on ancient machines, like rub 500mhz and only really needs like 128 ram. Then use this to do network backups of all OSes on your network. 

AFAIK it can't be done easily. you can set it to a program and use gmail, or use a reghack like this $URL$ IE might have addons to do it too, but their addons are few and crap. 

What about 2010 Started edition? Its free and add support but It might do everything you need to if you can deal with the ads. It might be OEM only, but I'm sure you could find it somewhere. 

With enough screw drivers you can take apart anything, but I think its got a smaller than normal 2.5 inch hard drive. I cannot confirm this however. 

I'm running opensuse 11.4. Did updates the other day, one of them a kernel. Its not running 2.6.37.1.-1.2 desktop. I can only assume it was running whatever came with 11.4 before, as it was only installed maybe a week ago. After rebooting for the update my lan card stopped working. Physically its all good, its a software problem. I cannot due to other problems use a DVD or flash drive on this computer. I am not wiping it either, not an option. When I go to Yast>Network settings, neither ifup or network manager work, under any configuration possible. When set to Ifup, [realtek] RTL8111/8168B PCI Express gigbit ethernet controller shows up. It says its not configured, but i cannot Edit or delete it. I can only add a new device. I need help figuring out how to add a device that will work. Its a foxconn r20D2 box. 

BRIGHTEN the image way up, with High contrast if things were pasted badly into the image, it usually leave a edge around it that will show up. 

That's all i could ever do with the same stuff, i could get the high resolutions to work, but they would flicker and lag. 800 by 600 and usually 50hz was the only setting it worked for with HDMI. 

Install snyaptiks and configure it. I have a 1000HE with opensuse 11.3 and it works out of the box, minus the tapping, which was configured in the KDE mouse settings. 

I've found if i messed with ANYTHING, on any of the 3 eee pcs I have available, the backup fails. If you have the CD and can use that, feel free to wipe the partitions. Boot boster can be turned off in bios, so i assume you can safely wipe that if you turn it off. 

Pull out the ram. remove the battery on the motherboard. Press and hold the power button down for maybe 30 seconds (with battery and plug removed) and it should clear it. 

I use to have a labtec (made my logitech) webcam, USB, that cost me $20 about 5 years ago, It had exactly what you wanted, snapshots or movies when motion was detected, and adjustable senseativity. While this model is long gone, i'm sure theres cheap solutions out there. 

I know there are scripts out there that listen for a rotate event and the flip the stylus the right way, I can't find my bookmark though.. I know theres some in opensuse, a close brother to fedora, take a look around and you might find it 

Depends on what you need Just command prompt, putty is light and great. for file transfers and light shell acess, winscp is good (filezilla works too for file transfer) for shell access and remote windows viewing the one and only product is xming (which does not do the same thing as VNC, which is remote desktop. Xming just allows you to open single apps across a network using X on windows.) 

In my experience, adobe eats processor on any system, any browser, any time you run it. but in the latest firefox theres a bug with overheating, and adobe take full advantage of it. Also dells are not known to be the most efficient of machines. 

I'm running songbird on opensuse 11.2 KDE 4.3.1 on my EEE pc. On windows, there is a hotkey thing inside Songbird, so i set META F9,10,11,12 as media keys and it work just fine. On linux, there is not hotkey thing in songbird, and I would like to set those same hotkeys. I've played around with the Amarok Hotkeys, which are now setup that way, and looked in all the KDE shortcuts, but cannot find a way to add a new program and new hot keys. I know its possible, I did it before once, but the KDE shortcut programs have changed and I no longer see the stuff i used to do it before. I'd like to do the same to banshee at some point, but Songbird is the important program. Any Ideas? Any way to set those keys to generic media buttons? 

I've run a python script server for a online terminal interface and apache at the same time. Only cause they were different ports. So yes its possibly, but depending on your setup, it may not work well. But this is not a problem were you'd need to do that, look for an alternative solution. 

Use SugarSync or SpiderOak to backup the same directory as dropbox. Update 1/2017: Plenty of options for other backup systems these days including self hosted ones like NextCloud. Dropbox has an option for email notifications for new logins to alert you quicker to a problem. Dropbox has 30 days un-delete if you can access the web interface. Pro has an option to extend that to one year. Dropbox has added 2 factor auth to help prevent bad logins from ever happening in the first place. There's also a number of hardware NAS solutions and external hard drives that can sync to dropbox, providing a number of ways - from an offline disk to a custom backup plan on a NAS to keep a snapshot of your files. 

MythTV and its many plugins may offer what your looking for. I know it can do videochating in Kopete and such, but what it does beyond that, and how it does it is beyond me. 

Give him a brake, it may not be the type of personal info your thinking of. For all we know it could be a home email address he setup with imap at work. Simple thing is to delete the files, securely if you feel the need to. with Eraser or similar products. Run ccleaner, or glary utls. and then wipe free disk space to make sure its not recoverable. Portableapps.com has a lot of these apps that can run off a USB stick, if you are not allowed to install apps on the work computer. 

You can do at JonT and barrponto said, or you can usually clear the recent history, cache, active logins and cookies, log into the site in question and when you login, you'll be prompted to change update your information for that site. It happens to me switching between my Gmail and Google apps all the times. It always wants me to update my info after the cookie expires or I clear it and login with the other account, but it works for a single account if you clear the info. 

Songbird can probably do that, I'm not 100% sure, but it scobbles and can play shoutcast radio (both of these via an addon) Its not sure this will work, but its worth a shot. there are songbird .debs out there, a quick google search will find them. 

Yep aviraldg is right. rename it to a .zip and use your favorite extraction tool. XPIs for firefox, etc, are the same process. 

one thing that makes PPTs look crappy all the time is copy and pasted images with either a white or black background around an icon, where it should be transparent. Do yourself a favor, if you have any of these, edit it, because it causes me and probably others to think the creator isn't bright enough to clean up an image. 

Make and model of the computer, model of the ATI board and version of the driver please. Also laptop, desktop, thin client, SFF etc? I had problems like that with a ATI 3200 mobility raderon on my TX2510us tabler PC from HP. one driver updated helped it, but it eventually killed the 2 year old machine. Its spare parts for now. 

User Agent switcher. Seth mentions one, but if you search for user agent, there have been many addons over the life of firefox to do that. Currently, i think only the one Seth linked you to works. 

Mythtv either on opensuse, fedora, ubuntu or knoppix (there are specialized versions for each of the, I.E. mythdora and knopmyth you Do Not need a TV card to use this, but it makes a great media box, streaming music, etc and if you just need file storage you can set up samba shared or even use a Virtual machine of Freenas 

How much data do you need to sync? If it all in different directories or all in, oh say ~/documents/? rsync will work, but there may be options that give you other advantages. Dropbox.com is one, provides 2 gig free storage. $URL$ This link will get you an extra 250 megs free if Dropbox looks like a good solution for you. SpiderOak is another, same thing, 2 gig free, pay after that (OpenSUSE users get a discount) Theres also Unison. $URL$ Which does a great syncing job. Almost anything will work for this, its just gonna be a matter what works best, whats the fastest, what gives you stuff like the chocolates on the pillows at a hotel as a nice little bonus. 

change the network type to Home. and open all the sharing/printing ports in windows network and sharing center 

Well for once, update Flash, its now like 10.0.42 or something of that sort. Also you could try up or downgrading Firefox. And lastly if neither of those work, either save the page for offline use and try that. Or Take a screenshot and print the screenshot. EDIT: just curious, Gnome or KDE, i don't know if that will make a difference, but it could. 

Can you give us the make and model of the laptop and the NIC. The best way is to plug into a lan and let your linux OS do its thing from there. If for whatever reason you can't get a lan connection, you could use a program called Keryx to download the drivers at a public library another computer. Also, opensuse supports most atheros chips out of the box. As do many distros. Simply switching the linux distro can help. 

Peazip works nicely for that,never tryed using 7zip for that, but if the How-To Geek says it works, it probably does. 

There is no real way to be completely anonymous on the internet. You can use Tor, change your IP all the time, delete all data left behind, but given enough time, it can always be traced back to you. So yes, for simply hiding one or 2 sites you visit, a proxy and all these other good idea work fine. But if your not supposed to be doing it, legal reasons or whatnot, just remember, they can always fun you given enough time and enough subpoenas will always find you. 

To answer the title, yes, but just be careful how many and what you run. Call of Duty 7 is not going to run alone. Office, pidgin, and Firefox will run fine on any netbook. (admittedly chrome runs better) Your OS will also depend on how well things run. XP seems to run very nicely, Linux can be bloated, or very slim and fast. I can't speak for windows 7, but I've heard lousy things about Starter Edition. The big disadvantage is the speed. Ram can be upgraded, allowing for better multitasking. Also, the lack of a CD drive can be a disadvantage. The screens are small and sometimes hard to see, and some programs do not scale well to them. Inkscape is a prime example. The keyboards take some getting use to, be in general are pretty good, YMMV. I've found a lot of the tracpads suck quite badly, sketchy multitouch, rough on the skin surfaces, lousy sensitivity even with configurations. Also, most netbooks, are very hard to upgrade or fix, anything beyond the ram. Your better off ordering anything extra you need at the OEM level usually. I have a Asus 1000HE. My mom had and broke a ASUS 1005HAB. I've taken both apart, the 1000he is a great machine in every way, the 1005 is not. We just got a 12" asus netbook. I am unsure of the model number. 

Try HTTrack website copier or a similar program, better than command line. download it all to a directory, sort by .html copy and paste them all somewhere else, delete the leftovers $URL$ 

Windows 7 has the ability to play an mp3 player through the mic port to speaker. I think they call it microphone listening or something. You could probably record from the mic port then. EDIT: see this link Lifehacker.com.au
