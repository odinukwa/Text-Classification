VMware tools wouldn't have anything to do this. It's an optional package. You say it's not the firewall because you stopped it with . Still, I would try , which will flush all rules (until you reload the saved config). Here are some questions / things to try: 1 - Which machine are you pinging from? Is it also on the same ESXi host, or outside the ESXi's virtual switch? What happens when you ping it from another virtual machine on the same host? 2 - What happens when you try to ping something else from this VM? 3 - What does a traceroute show to/from the VM? 4 - Do you have any VLAN id's configured? 5 - Does the MAC address listed in match the adapter mentioned in VM -> Edit Settings? 6 - What Ethernet driver do you have configured for the VM? 7 - Have you tried installing a fresh VM? 

When you see "!Z" or "!X" in a traceroute, what does that mean? Where is it coming from, and how do I fix it? 

We have a debate in our office going on whether it's necessary to get a hardware firewall or set up a virtual one on our VMWare cluster. Our environment consists of 3 server nodes (16 cores w/ 64 GB RAM each) over 2x 1 GB switches w/ an iSCSI shared storage array. Assuming that we would be dedicating resources to the VMWare appliances, would we have any benefit of choosing a hardware firewall over a virtual one? If we choose to use a hardware firewall, how would a dedicated server firewall w/ something like ClearOS compare to a Cisco firewall? 

Different Windows editions support different amounts of RAM, for example: Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard: 32GB Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise: 2TB I'm curious about the impact, if any, of having more than 32GB of RAM on a Server 2008 R2 Standard box. Will performance suffer due to Windows having to manage more memory, despite not being able to utilise it? This question assumes that no physical or architecture limits are being hit. I.e., Windows is well aware that the machine has >32GB RAM, but only 32GB is usable. 

No, this is a deliberate licensing decision taken by Microsoft. If you want a domain, get Professional. Even if you found some kind of hack, it would be a breach of license. 

Surely the answer is reasonably obvious. If you have (and configure) 4x 1Gb NIC's then you have the potential to attain 4 Gigabits Per Second of data throughput if all 4 IP addresses are hit hard. If you configure all 4x IP's on one interface, then you can only ever get 1Gbps shared between them all. There's nothing inherently wrong with having multiple IP's on one NIC, but if you can spread them across multiple physical interfaces, then there's absolutely no reason not to. 

You should run both commands in PowerShell as Powershell is more than capable of manipulating Environmental variables. I.e.: 

Did you create records on your domain for your DKIM public key? If not, there's no way for Gmail to validate it. Do you have any records setup to validate that your server can send emails from the domain? Is it configured correctly? There are also tools on the internet that will help you troubleshoot issues. A search like "DKIM validator" should give you some tools to verify the DKIM record is visible. Also, what do the headers say? Sometimes email servers add headers to indicate the reason why a message was sent to spam.

If I had a dozen "Work" servers with just PHP-FPM (with other Nginx servers in front), is it possible to setup PHP to store user uploaded files on a different server? I'm looking to avoid syncing user files on each "Work" server. I want to keep user uploaded files on an isolated server. With files that need to be accessible to the public, they could be distributed through a CDN. I have several reasons for wanting to do this: 1) The sum file-size of all the uploaded files are several GB. 99% of them are jpg/png/pdf, but there are thousands of them. If I add another "Work" server, I'd rather not sync those files to another server. These "Work" servers should only contain the application code and do the work. 2) From a security standpoint, I don't want user uploaded files on these servers. So I basically want to avoid writing these files on the hard drives of the "Work" servers. What options do I have, if any? 

And so on. With the "Administrator" account in particular, it could also be caused by a name clash betwen the local administrator account and the domain administrator account. Either way, this is all just part of Windows Profile Management (Or it's lack of, I guess you could say) and unless you're having a specific issue I'd just forget about it. 

Firstly, let's be absolutely clear - what you are asking for is not a normal thing for your average desktop application. Applications should generally run in the user context allowing all resources to be secured on a per-user basis - the sort-of exception being apps which require enhanced privileges and request a UAC elevation. However, some enterprise applications will use a service account to do certain operations. For example, it may use a service account to perform Active Directory operations that the running user wouldn't generally have. To achieve this, the administrator would need to provide credentials and you'd then use impersonation to perform the required operations. Again, though, I'll reiterate - this is not normal behaviour for a user facing desktop application. 

How on Earth do you expect these 2 servers to share information if they can not talk to each other? Serious question. The answer is to set your network so that they can communicate properly... Serious answer! 

I have 3 ESXi hosts, each with 4 uplinks dedicated to a port group. I want to utilize each of these uplinks for incoming/outgoing traffic (load balancing). From what I understand I need to setup link aggregation and on my Force10 switches (stacked) and set IP Hash based load balancing. VMware KB article 1021492 shows how to do this with Force10. What isn't clear to me is, how many port channels do I need to setup? One per ESXi host, or one for the entire port group? Does it matter? 

I'm using the CentOS 6 netinstall ISO with some kickstart files on an http server. When the ISO boots I hit TAB and enter the boot options . My kickstart files do not have a parameter, so it should be prompting. When I leave out it tries to use DHCP. With it only prompts for IP information. Unfortunately anaconda is hell bent on automatically discovering the hostname, which ends up being a reverse DNS lookup of the IP, or if nothing was found. Is there a way to make anaconda prompt for the hostname, or some way to pre-enter it through a custom boot option? There used to be for CentOS 5, but this no longer works in 6. 

How does this work with logging? Does each node write to the same place? What about configuring static ip addresses? If machine A writes to the disk, does machine B pick it up? When he says "web node" does he mean just the web server? I'm assuming this means the web application as well (PHP/Perl), correct? Is this even a good idea (with mostly using RAM)? Can this same thing be done with iSCISI? 

This is usually defined in the user properties panel in Active Directory. Check there and change if necessary. 

Honestly - this isn't likely to be an issue. I've seen hundreds (And I mean that literally) of school IT setups - they all have these messages and it's simply just part of the system. You're doing the right things and as @joeqwerty says - it provides feedback to the user that they've been deliberately prevented from doing something. If it's possible to suppress it, then it's a configuration I've never seen, so is almost certainly unsupported at best and unstable at worst. 

We use Citrix Provisioning Server for this purpose. It only really helps you if your VDI's are read-only though. 

The Windows 7 libraries are actually just XML files with some clever shell extensions managing them. They're all called [Library_Name].library-ms (E.g. Pictures.library-ms) and can be opened in any text editor such as notepad by dragging and dropping. The files can then be published using any normal mechanism - scripts, Group Policy Preferences etc. There are a couple of things that I discovered, which you should be aware of: 

In order to change default behaviour for new accounts, you need to edit the Default User profile. However, this is not 

In your case, the correct answer is that the software needs to add its configuration items to these sub-locations. It's unlikely you can do that, so unfortunately you're stuck. Your ADM is still perfectly usable, but you need to be very careful about tattooing. 

We're in the planning/development stage for our new platform and with everything separated out we'll need to setup between 9 to 16 servers, a load balancer, 2 or 3 hardware firewalls, and a VPN. During development we need to simulate all of this as cheaply as possible. Ideally I'd like to be able to setup a single machine with a lot of RAM and virtualize all of this to figure out what works and what doesn't. What are my better options as far as virtualization? VMWare? Other? How can I virtualize all the appliances as well? The appliances our data center offers: Cisco ASA 5510 (firewall), Foundry FCSLB8 Serveriron XL (load balancer) (We'll be running CentOS 6 64bit on our servers) Looking for something super easy. Something that will help me learn the real environment for later on. 

Can I assign individual ports on a single adapter to different vSwitches? In other words can I assign 2 ports for SAN and 2 ports for LAN on a 4 port nic? 

About six months ago we transitioned from an in-house Exchange 2003 server to a hosted Exchange 2010 service. For the most part this has worked well, but the providers OWA constantly times out. About 6/10 requests time out or more, and it's gotten to the point where OWA is just unusable. To give you an example: I'll login, read an email, choose reply and the window for replying gives me a request has timed out message. After a few attempts I'll get it to work and reply. After that I'll read another email and it'll timeout. I contacted the provider about this and they said it's a known issue with Exchange 2010, for all providers, they're working with Microsoft to correct the issue, and there is no ETA. To be clear this isn't a session issue. I don't have to login, it just says the request timed out and to try again. After a few attempts it does work. It's just extremely annoying. I've spent a litte time researching the problem and I can't find anything that would suggest it's a common issue. Exchange 2010 has been around for a while, so I would suspect that if it was a huge problem it would have been corrected by now. So is my provider full of crap, or is there really an issue that has yet to be corrected? If the issue does exist, is there any docs on it? 

If these home machines are supplied by them, then your demarcation point is the VPN software. I don't think you should be worried about how they log in. 

Oh gosh - don't even think about it, please. If it's still running, with no errors then you have no choice but to wait. Doing anything else stands a high chance of killing the task and leaving you with a inconsistent file system. 

There is no in built method of doing this. If all your clients are the same then you could push out a static background policy, but this would overwrite any image they have. Alternatively, you may be able to get your desired result by using something similar to BGInfo, though: $URL$ 

Even if you can install it, how do you expect to use it? If the server's that important, do you really want to be administering in a foreign language? 

A very crude way to do this would be to save the running configuration, make the change and then set the router to reboot.* Many engineers use this method when working remotely to ensure that they can get back to the box is they accidentally break the way they're connected. Use the following command to set a reboot in 5 minutes (I don't know what the max is, but it's always in minutes). And then use the second command to subsequently cancel it when you're happy.
