1080p YouTube HTML5 video running on the secondary monitor (in Chrome or Firefox): ~44 FPS, CPU load: ~50% on core 4. The same YouTube video running on the primary monitor on top of the game: ~48 FPS, CPU load: ~50% on core 4. SMPlayer playing a 1024x426 AVC video on the secondary monitor: ~50 FPS, CPU load: ~25% on core 4. 

Now, one thing I noticed is that performance varies depending on whether the game window is focused or not. The benchmarks above are given for the case when the game window is focused. If the game window is focused, I see clear choppiness in video playback (both in YouTube and in SMPlayer). If another window is focused, video playback is smooth, but game FPS drops more. My specs: Windows 10 x64, Intel i5-4690K, Gigabyte Z97-D3H, 8Gb RAM, R9 390 video card. The primary monitor (connected to R9 390) runs at 1920x1200, the secondary at 1600x1200. EDIT: I took a music-only YouTube video and tried to play it in various resolutions from 240p to 1080p. The FPS dropped gradually from 58 to 48 FPS as I increased the resolution. 

I am trying to understand why I experience FPS drops in demanding games when a video is playing in background and how to fix it. My particular setup (see the specs at the bottom): two monitors in extended desktop mode, the primary monitor connected via DisplayPort to an AMD R9 390 video card, the other via DVI alternatively to the on-die Intel HD 4600 graphics output or to the R9 390's DVI output. I will demonstrate the problem with Witcher 3 game, but the same problem occurs with at least one other game that I tried - World of Tanks (which is where the issue actually matters, as sometimes I put on music from YouTube while in game). In all the experiments below I run Witcher 3 on my primary monitor in windowed full-screen mode and measure the FPS in it with FRAPS. To guarantee stable FPS, I put the game on pause (by pressing ESC). I also set affinity of the Witcher 3 process to the first 3 cores and set the affinity of other applications to the 4th core. The CPU load has remained stable on cores 1-3 throughout the tests at 45-50%. Baseline test when the game is not running: CPU load is at ~0% on cores 1-3 and ~5% on core 4. Baseline test when the game is running, but no video being played in parallel: stable 58 FPS, CPU load: ~10% on core 4. First batch of tests: the secondary monitor is connected to the R9 390. 

Notice that it's sorted by Col A, Col B, Col C, in the sense of, it's sorted by Col A, and for each chunk that is like within Col A, it is sorted by col B, and for each chunk that is like with Col A and Col B, it is sorted by Col C. I'd like to know if there is a rather automatic way to do that in excel, rather than rather manual process of sorting each chunk? 

I've been using Ms Word 2013 for a while, and suddenly in one of my documents, this has appeared..(See pic below) note- If I create a new document it's not in the new one 

no.. maybe a driver is to an extent but it's more of a library of code, and drivers have almost nothing at all to do with drives specifically. Lots of hardware requires drivers which is software. (it's really really rare that you have to install a driver for a disk drive maybe some RAID drives.. or some weird thing to get an old windows version to recognize a rewritable cd or something). Printers need drivers, and to get a printer working you almost always have to install a driver. I don't know much about drivers, but drivers are pieces of software that hardware use to communicate with the operating system. 

There is an extension called Quicktabs, and an extension called Tab Menu. Both are good. Tab menu is a bit harder to find, but here it is mentioned on chromeplugins forum which has a link to it on mediafire and there's a link to it on ge.tt Here is quicktabs on chrome extensions site- quicktabs it has a search which is good. you can of course install both. And to install Tab Menu, since it isn't on the chrome extensions site, but we have the crx file(the actual installation file), so you can drag the CRX file into tools..extensions and install it that way. 

Your answer to use dos2unix and unix2dos is excellent. Here is another way based on your answer. You can use Gnuwin32 though funnily enough the Gnuwin32 package that has the commands is Cygutils $URL$ so then you'll get unix2dos.exe and dos2unix.exe in C:\Program Files....\GnuWin32\bin and with that in your PATH. 

It's as if maybe somehow the text and pictures are stuck in a giant header that is taking up the whole of the first page and can't easily be edited at the same time as the rest of the document can. I never normally mess with headers/footers at all. 

Will return the number 4. So, putting it together. If your data starts in A1, and you want to copy it to a new location starting at G1, copy this formula to G2. Then, drag it to the right and down. If you ever want to reorder the destination, all you have to do is change the column titles. 

Here's an implementation of the approach in my comment to your question. Cell A2 contains the base prefix that's common to all of the URLs that you want to generate. Cells B2, B3, B4,... are the locations that you want to generate. C2, C3, C4,... are the number of strings to generate for each location. Each location will be generated in its own column. The formula in E1 is: 

You're trying to run the script as root, so you can just add it to /etc/rc.local, which is run by root at startup. 

Just filtering a simple grid will do what you want. Highlight your data, and click on "Filter". If you want to find all employees who are missing Form2, then you'll filter that column to show only blanks. 

Is the EN_WG prefix consistent? If so, you can insert a column (Column A, let's say) to the left. Copy the first B1 to A1, and then put this in A2 and fill down. 

If you have a headers in row 1, then you don't have to manually copy the first EN_WG_ over and can start the formula in A2 directly. This translates your data into a horizontal layout and allows you to sort by your category (Now in Column A). 

I understand that this requires me to have the workbooks open at the same time. Is there another method for defining the dynamic ranges, or should I just concatenate the supplier names with the order numbers? 

To sum the integers, paste this into L2 (the first sub_W1 cell) and right and down to the end of your table. 

The "B" and "C" cells are moving down by one each time. Continue the pattern as you move to the right, and then fill the formulas down. If you have hundreds of locations and don't want to edit each formula, then let me know. The whole thing can be done with a single formula, but it will require the use of INDIRECT() which I try to stay away from. It's one of the volatile functions so must be used judiciously. 

I checked No share screen option in Skype it mentions $URL$ but I still see no option I see a plus icon 

I do not understand this, I am sure I have in the past clicked the button to draw a dot and selected a size and got a different sized dot. But it's not happening for me at the moment. 

Never had that before.. Have you tried another ps2 keyboard? Have you looked at Keyboards in device manager, and tried right click and update driver.. and go to properties and look there does it say working properly.. could be something there. I doubt this is the issue but look there in in device manager at properties.power management and make sure it's not any checkbox about windows letting it power down automatically, is unchecked. of course you could try usb as no doubt you know but it'd be interesting to know what's going on here.. or for you to get a ps2 keyboard working.. especially since it works in the BIOS! Very strange. Normally ps2 is very reliable and especially, if it works in the BIOS it doesn't stop.. strange..! 

It is possible for your active partition to not be C. As my active partition is the first on the disk, and while this windows calls itself D, there's another partition from an old installation, which calls itself C, and that partition is not active. The asterisk diskpart uses just marks the selected partition, not the active one. Ignore the bullet points, that's just superuser converting * to asterisks. If you manage to format your active partition, then you wouldn't be able to boot, but it's easily fixable. also you can open a cmd prompt and do dir /a e:\boot.ini If it doesn't have that, it's not the active partition. If it does, then it could potentially be, and has been at one time. boot.ini stores the booting menu that lists your windows installations. If that is gone then you'll have trouble booting, but as mentioned in comment, even that's easy to fix just load the recovery console e.g. from cd.. and run bootcfg /rebuild. there are some other commands you can try. fixboot and fixmbr are the relevant others people try to fix problems booting. Also, if you have more than one hard disk ten each might have an active partition, but the BIOS decides which hard disk is booted from. Then after that, whichever partition on that disk is active, is booted. 

Excel can not read vCard files. You have to convert it to a .csv. Luckily, this is easy. In Windows 7 or newer, copy the vCard file to your Contacts folder (located at C:\Users\YOU\Contacts). Then, select the file and Choose "Export > CSV (Comma Separated Values) 

I'm going to be referencing this data from other sheets. Obviously, using vlookup on the order number alone will be unreliable without differentiating between suppliers. My first solution works locally, but I can't get it to work between workbooks. I set up a named range inside the above sheet using INDIRECT, MATCH, and COUNTIF so that the ranges will grow as new items are added. In this example, I have Range_ACME defined as: 

This is for a project at work that must be done with a Windows batch file so that my successors don't have to mess with Cygwin. 

I have a table that has three columns: ID, Date, Group. There are two rows for each unique ID (where Group = 1 or where Group = 2). How can I combine these into a table with one row per ID and the Date values sorted into two columns? I have: 

Scott Craner's answer is works efficiently, but since you asked for a formula using IF(), I'll toss this one into the ring. You can accomplish this by nesting statements. The flow for goes like this: "Some comparison that evaluates to either TRUE or to FALSE,"What to do if ", What to do if ") So, you'll test for your first string and return the text value if a match is found. If the match isn't found, you run another to look for the second. And continue that logic until you cover all conditions. So, you'll end up with this: 

I inherited this data structure. I have a bunch of products and their supplier information laid out as so: 

You can also just search for #N/A values. Highlight the column that you want to search, hit , and click on the Options >> button. 

The Bash man page has a section on Special Parameters. The one you want is , which expands to the PID of the current shell. should do what you want, though I'm on Win7 now and can't test it. 

As with Vlookup, MATCH does not require your data to be sorted so long as you set the third argument to zero (FALSE).
