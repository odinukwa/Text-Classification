AFAIK, in LibreOffice / OpenOffice Calc, you can't use the find/replace functionality to replace the style of a cell that contains a certain text. But you could achieve the same result by using conditional formatting: To apply a style conditionally depending on the the content of a cell range, just do the following: 

If you already have inserted a Table of Contents, right-click on it and select ""; otherwise, put the cursor at the place where the ToC should appear, and select Menu "" -> "" -> "", and select Type = "". Now, you should see the following window: 

select the entire column; select menu -> or hit CTRL+1 On the tab, select category; Select as language; Set as user-defined format pattern: 

The lookup array is , the search criterion is (this is a regular expression, for syntax see link above). The result of the formula is , since the second cell in the lookup array is the first cell that matches the search pattern. EDIT: Regarding the regular expression: here's a list of regular expression characters. The expression consists of: 

This effectively replaces each cell's content with itself, but drops the apostrophe that marks cell content as text. As result, the "textual" numbers are converted into numerical values, allowing calc to sort according to the numerical values. So, starting with this content (each cell contains a string!)... 

You can set the index type in the "Indexes and Tables" dialogue: Menu -> -> . Just select the index type from the combobox: 

Now, just start to type. When hitting Tab, you can continue typing centered text, and with another Tab right-aligned text. If you need this kind of paragraph style more often, just create a custom paragraph style. To insert tabstops even more quickly, do the following: 

You can solve this issue by using different paragraph styles for the frame content and the main text: 

It's a standard task for printers / printer drivers to adapt the printing data to the media size. So, the solution depends on the printer you're using and the capabilities of the printer and the printer driver. In LO Writer, there's no feature to "zoom" the complete document, affecting every page element (font sizes, tables, pictures and so on). Things are different in Calc: there, you can tell LO Calc to shrink the content when printing (Menu -> -> ). 

put the function that yields the result for into a separate, protected sheet. This way, it's quite unlikely that the user accidentally tries to edit the cell holding your function. It has some other advantages: 

With a current version of Libreoffice Calc (tested with 4.2), you can address the complete Column A with (if in Tools -> Options -> Calc -> Formula is set to ). But AFAIK there's no way to reference a difference (complement), something like " without ". It would be great if would work, but it doesn't. 

check if the paragraph style has the proper settings; reset the cell style to the paragraph style defaults using Menu "Format" -> "Default Formatting"; Select the cell or its text and apply the paragraph style again. 

There are different ways to do this: The easiest solution would be to insert Frames with captions and let LibreOffice auto-number those frames (to be precise: its captions). But there's a drawback: the caption will appear above or below the Frame, not at its right or left, like in your example. If this doesn't matter and if it's ok for the caption to appear beneath the frame, i recommend this solution. Another way would be again to use frames, but without captions. Instead, place another "marginal" frame besides the main "content" frame. In the second frame, insert a field that will get automatically updated: Menu -> -> -> Tab -> Type , Selection or : 

is set to the redirection target if there is any. If not, is called with the original url; if yes, calls the redirection target. The parameter makes create the subdirs. Of course, this handles only one level of redirection. To make it more robust, you'ld have to check recursively if there's a redirection. So, it isn't just a matter of command line options if you want to solve this issue in a reliable way. 

To get this result, you will have to modify the plot options of the data series to continue the lines even if values are missing: 

To insert a hyperlink to an image: Make sure to select "" at the left of the insert Hyperlink dialogue (1), then click the button at the right of the "" text field (2). A list of target categories appears, allowing to select the appropriate image: 

Create the Calc spreadsheet, save and close it (you can still modify it later, even from within writer); In Writer, at each place where the table (Calc sheet) should appear, insert (link) the calc sheet as an OLE object: 

Just use a command line tool like pdftk or the PDFbox java library to postprocess the pdf. Here's an example to encrypt the file using pdftk, allowing the user to print the file (from the pdftk Server examples): 

The cell reference depends on your starting point. If you want to apply the conditional formatting to range , it would be ; LibreOffice adapts the cell reference for all cells of the selected range automatically. 

Insert a header (Menu "Insert" -> "Header and Footer" -> "Header" -> "Default style"; put the cursor into the header; Menu "Insert" -> "Field" -> "More fields", or hit CTRL+F2 Select the "document" tab; there, in the "Type" list, select Chapter; in the "Format" list, select "Chapter name" (or any other entry); in the lower right corner, select the heading level to use. Click Insert. 

That's it. Now, if you apply the "Heading 2" style to those headings, LO Writer should continue counting the chapters. Style changes should get propagated to the different Heading styles as usual, and all Headings should appear in a TOC as usual. You may manually restart the chapter count by modifying the paragraphs style of the heading where numbering should restart. To adapt your current document to the Heading 1/2 structure, you may use (CTRL+H), first replacing paragraph styles with , then replacing styles with . If you need this in more than one document, repeat those steps in an empty Writer document and save it as Writer Template. 

The Min/Max values will be used for the range labels as well as for the count. The range labels are created using a simple concatenation: 

There are different options, depending on your needs. You could use a custom cell style only for cells containing hyperlinks, but you will have to assign that style manually or using a macro. Another way would be to use Conditional Formatting. With conditional formatting, you could check either for the cell text starting with "http", for example (using the LEFT function). But this works only if you're using the URL as link text. Another approach would be to insert hyperlinks using the HYPERLINK function. This way, you could use conditional formatting again, checking if the current cell contains the HYPERLINK function with the help of the FORMULA function. All those approaches aren't really straightforward, but they may work as a workaround. 

The result is the default result if the search failes (see the OpenOffice.org Calc documentation on the SEARCH function). Since all other strings don't contain "NY", that's the correct result for those cells. I assume you mistook the resulting "1" as a "boolean" result, whereas a failed search would result "0". But this isn't the case. The aforementioned documentation has some examples involving ISNUMBER and ISERROR to evaluate the result of the SEARCH function. 

To drag the formula, move the cursor over the little black box at the lower right of the Cell A1. The cursor will turn into a small cross-hair symbol. Now, click left and move the cursor down or to the left. 

Not exactly as requested, but SHIFT+SPACE / CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE selects current row / column respectively (at least in LibreOffice Calc - i didn't test it with OpenOffice!). To unselect, just move the selection using the cursor keys. 

..., select it, start the chart wizard and select , the result preview already shows that the data points are cÃ³rrectly spaced: 

Now. just select the data area (here: A1:B6), select menu -> > , confirm with OK, and drag the column headers in the appropriate fields: 

That's it. The following screenscot shows the solution applying a custom style to all cells containing the string "ue" in the cell range : 

(assuming is the first cell to be formatted conditionally). If you want to define that formatting rule for a range of cells, you can still reference the first cells of that range: 

I suppose you're searching the functionality. It's the first entry in the menu. Just select the complete content (CTRL+A) and hit CTRL+M to restore default style-defined formats. 

Notice that in the main area, the content will automatically recognize the header's drawing area, so you don't even have to adjust the page margins (you may do so to have some padding between the margin area and the content). Fill the margin area with any color 

In OOo as well as in Excel, just combine an absolute reference for the column with a relative reference for the row. This way, you can copy the conditional format to every cell, and it will evaluate the values of cells A and C in the current row. In OOo, you will have to define the conditional formatting as follows: 

Since the formula's structure looks ok, it may be a problem of Function separators. I don't have dutch l11n installed, so i can't test this myself. You may check the formula separators ( or ) using Tools -> Options -> LibreOffice Calc -> Formula. This is the setting for en_us localization: 

Adding a ToC in LO Writer is no problem, but how to insert a ToC in a file? For a workbook with tables longer than one page to be distributed as printout (not as file), it would be nice to have a ToC at the first sheet, listing all other sheets in the same file with page numbers. I've tried to insert a Writer OLE Object, which allows for adding a ToC (inside the OLE object...), but the object seems to ignore the Headings from the other sheets. Inserting the sheet names using hyperlinks would be ok, but i found no way to also insert the page numbers. If this requires a macro (StarBasic preferred), i'll offer a bounty. Any ideas? PS: I've found a Q/A in the OpenOffice.org forums dating from 2008, but i don't understand how to implement it...
