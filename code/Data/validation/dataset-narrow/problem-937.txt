I currently have Windows 7 installed on my PC. However, I just tried out Ubuntu via booting from a disc and I love it. I want to install it onto my HDD, but I don't want to get rid of Windows 7. I know HOW to do this, but I am a little unsure what the consequences might be. What does it mean to install Ubuntu alongside Windows? Do they share the same resources? Also, I have my HDD already partitioned into two sections, a 70 GB section where Windows is installed and then another 400 GB section where all my data is stored. There is currently 26 GB free on the 70GB partition. I know Ubuntu doesn't take up much space. However, if I install Ubuntu in that space, will I still be able to install programs on Windows in the future? My main concern is that I am going to short-change my hard drive space for future installations. EDIT: I guess another big question I have is if I install a program on one OS, will the other be able to use it? 

If you want to hide a file in Windows 7 and you are the administrator, right click on the file or folder. Then click on the properties option. Under the general tab, there will be an attributes section. Check the box that says "Hidden". If it is a folder you are hiding, it will ask if you want to hide folders and sub-directories. Make the appropriate choice that you want. EDIT: You can also use third party tools to hide files like FileLocker or FolderLock. There is also a method of using the file extensions to hide the file here, but I have never tried it, so I am not sure how effective it is. 

Here is my current recording setup. I run a mic and a guitar line into an Alesis Multimix 6 mixer and from there, a USB goes into a Sound Blaster Recon 3D Fatal1ty sound card. I am using Audacity to record. My problem is that whenever I record, the sound quality is very poor and very low. Whenever I turn up the volume either on the PC itself or on the mixer, I get fairly bad distortion and feedback. Is there any way to improve this sound quality? I am running Windows 7. I have read that a pre-amp could help, but I would like to refrain from buying any more stuff. Are there any other devices or tips that could improve my sound quality? I also read that the signal in the USB cable could feedback to the mixer causing the distortion/feedback. I don't believe it's the sound-card or Audacity because I tried using the microphone that came with the soundcard and I got better sound quality than with the mixer. The only reason why I want to use the mixer is because I want to be able to control the guitar and the microphone levels separately. Oh, and I am using a Taylor 214ce guitar and a Shure SM58 microphone. 

I am a mac user and am used to quickly using the trackpad after typing. It seems that if any key is pressed, the trackpad is disabled for .5 to 1 seconds. Is there any way I can reduce or eliminate this delay? 

TLS 1.3 is not enabled by default You can enable this on iOS with this provisioning profile You can enable this on MacOS with this command in Terminal 

I'm trying to wire up an old college office (with 3 rooms) that has thick cement walls. Running ethernet is painful, and wifi can't break through the concrete. Can I use more than one HomePlug to connect these 3 rooms to the main switch (which would have its own plug) My thought is that the ethernet will broadcast the signal properly and that I don't have to worry about conflicts because the ethernet will handle the collisions appropriately. 

I have a EVGA 1500 Classified and am learning how to build my first high end PC in 12 years. Since the '90s something called Power Supply "Rails" was invented and I think it has something to do with the GPU. What are power supply rails (electrically speaking) and how should I use them intelligently (or not) in a custom build? 

Most "servers" permit file level auditing, however this is specific to each server, and specific to each file system. These audit logs may contain the information you're looking for, but if logging hasn't been enabled, then there isn't much you can gain in retrospect. The reason I put "servers" in quotes is because there is a different amount of features available for NTFS clients connecting to a NAS vs a Windows based server. Namely the Linux based variants may contain a different amount of audit granularity than the Windows based file servers. 

Here are an example of some SMTP headers that are used internally (in routing) to configure how exchange behaves: 

I was watching this video and at the 3:30 mark he discusses ITP addresses or TOR addresses. I understand that TOR is an anonymity network, and the fact he mentions ITP followed by TOR makes me want to understand what network he is referring to and what it can do. What is an ITP address? 

Actually, there is a separate \Recycler directory per partition (C:, D:, etc.). So it stays on the same partition/drive. Here is a screenshot from two drives on the same computer. 

You can do that as a batch file as in the accepted answer, or you can more simply make the mapping persistent: net use s: //pathto/share password /user:domain\user /PERSISTENT:YES 

Since it is not a domain, and thus not really one user, you need the user AND password to be the same on both computers. This allows for pass-through authentication. You need to set the Share's permissions to allow access, usually full for the administrator, and do it not for the administrator's group. I suspect this is where you are failing since the administrator on computer 1 is not really in the administrator's group on computer 2 since they are different users. You need to set the security permissions on the files. Again, I would set these permissions for the individual administrator user. 

Based on your other question, whatever was on the drive, including any partitions, will still be there. Even if the partitions were deleted, unless you secure wiped them, data recovery software would mostly likely be able to pull the data. 

I agree with slhck as far as look at the system requirements, but virtually anything you buy today will exceed that. Definitely exceed those numbers by a fair amount since those are usually bare minimums. Get as much RAM as you can, and go with a 64-bit OS. Hard disk space is cheap, so go with plenty (at least 1TB) since video takes up a lot of space. 

Of course, as the others said, CPU usage can be a factor if it is running constantly at 100% usage, but to answer the main question, "What makes a laptop overheat?", probably the single biggest thing is not using compressed air to blow out your heat sink/cpu fan. I recommend doing this on a regular basis, at least monthly, and your laptop will probably live a lot longer. 

I have 10 workstations that had Lync Basic, and 10 workstations that had the full Lync client. Now that I deployed patches, they are both Skype For Business. Is there any difference between the installations? In features or functionality? Below is a picture of a Lync Basic and a Lync full client, each upgraded to Skype For Business. Notice the different product IDs 

I'm using safari, and unsure if this works in other browsers, but when I signed up for a storm path account, I see the following URL 

The blob: prefix is new to me and I want to know if it works across all browsers, and what other prefixes might exist. 

I'm an OSX user and don't like that the scrolling feature moves the entire window on Windows 10. This creates a jarring effect on the entire screen, when I'm dealing with only a particular document. Outlook, with a preview pane, in full screen is an excellent example. IMHO, When I scroll down (or up) excessively, I don't expect the entire app to respond with a shake. Rather, the document (email for example) should respond, or nothing at all. How do I disable the "window shake" when I scroll up / down past the beginning or ending? 

A partial answer is available here, where it describes an Exchange security feature called the Header Firewall. The header firewall removes sensitive x-headers from messages and prevents abuse. The article describes how they are configured, but stops short of listing all the headers, the meanings of the rights, or the relationship to the checkboxes. That being said, I'll run the following command later to enumerate the various settings for send and receive connectors. 

It's reported that TLS 1.3 (currently in draft status) can reduce connection setup delays by 30% or approximately 30ms. How can I configure this on MacOS or iOS? 

I like this javascript based version of a systems thinking diagramming tool. It takes relationships and calculates the values behind it, then animates a dot along the path. So before I get further, I'll post another link to understanding a system here Question 

I know what Vonage says about putting it before the router, but I have set this up before and I simply go with this: Cable Modem--Linksys Router--Netgear Switch The Vonage box and PC get plugged into the switch. If this normal, and simple setup does not work, then you can try it their way, but every one I have done has worked. Only caveat, I usually use a Netgear router/switch combo. 

My thoughts are that it is either the driver, or the mouse itself, although there are a couple more things you can also try. I hate to say it though, my best guess is on the mouse, and replacing it will probably be the solution. You should see if you can try another mouse and/or check your driver in the Device Manager to make sure that it is using Microsoft driver version 6.1.7600.16385 (I am using Windows 7 SP1). 

ping 127.0.0.1 (the localhost) ping 192.168.1.100 (the first two tell if it can talk to itself) ping 192.168.1.200 (can talk to other hosts internally) ping 192.168.1.1 (can it talk to other hosts internally, especially the one that will forward to the Internet) Ping 8.8.8.8 or any other external IP address (proves you can get to the Internet) ping www.google.com (tests DNS resolution. If it fails, you can test www.cisco.com to be sure it is not the host. If you get this far, and you still cannot use your browser or other application, you know it is application-related, not your TCP/IP, and there is no reason to tamper with the TCP/IP settings) 

If you want it to load on bootup, rather than when you log in, if you have XP Pro (XP home does not include gpedit.msc), do this: 

No, the latter: If you had version 5, you had to download version 6 separately. At least in the past, it only updated maintenance releases. It is hard to say if version 6 will actually update to version 7 though since it has not happened yet.
