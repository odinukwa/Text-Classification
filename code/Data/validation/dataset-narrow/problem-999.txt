How to prevent data leak from without or ? Is there a simple way to configure automatic mounting of during boot, in a way that files are written to the disk withoug leaving recoverable data after the computer is turned off? Like with a random key for instance... I'm using Ubuntu 10.10. 

Comparing is complicated, these are mostly orthogonal approaches to computing. Windows is more straightforward for daily use. It is achieved mostly by hiding everything from the user, to the point that advanced users have a hard time finding things. An operating system based on Free Software, like GNU/Linux distros, is less straightforward to nowadays average users. Free Software never has anti-features, since being Free means that anti-features could be easily detected and fixed, and demoralize a project. No spyware, no malware, not even nagware. A Free Software will never consume your computer cycles and bandwidth doing stuff you wouldn't want it to do. It may be checking digital signatures from the distributor for your own security but you can disable it. In general Linux is are stable and reliable, and in general more forward compatible (Think of MS Word format that suddenly starts saving documents in a format that is not even recognized by the MS Word sold a year before). And they cost zero dollars in royalties. If you take the HD of a Windows computer and plug it on another computer, it will go crazy about not having the drivers and not understanding that hardware at all. If it has a standard Ubuntu install for instance, unless the other computer is too new or too old, it will work out of the box. Windows comes in a DVD and can be installed in a few languages, or sometimes comes even bound to a given one. Most GNU/Linux distros come in a CD, and Ubuntu comes in several many languages. Ah, Not all Free Software is promoted/endorsed by FSF. Linux fully supports Windows filesystems. Windows does not support Linux filesystems at all. Linux supports many standard secure encryption schemes out-of-the-box. But for the Desktop applications, mail clients, web browsers, Office suites, media management, etc., I feel that at that time (2006), most of well-known Free Software was much less developed than it is now. 

What I do: Don't mess with the authorized keys: place the key be inside the home folder as it is mounted by Ubuntu. I know, this breaks passwordless ssh or scp into the machine because the key is not actually there. Let's find a workaround. Run ssh username@server from a terminal, so that it will mount your encrypted folder, and now you have your key at the expected directory. (This is the default behavior in Ubuntu, when you ssh into a machine it also calls all the stuff that mounts your encrypted home, just like a local login.) Leave this terminal open. From this point on you can launch your scripts or scp commands. If your key had been set properly, it will work seamlessly, without prompting for a password each time. When you are finished, log off in that terminal that you had left open in first place. I run it all the time, with the purpose of backup too, and I find it very practical. I am assuming: 

It's not clear if your question is specific about client=server or if you cannot deploy an sftp server at all. You should check: 

You can check SumatraPDF. It's minimalistic. Light, fast and virus-proof. Now fully-featured and secure... I guess not running on Windows, and switching OS is probably too much cost for a company. 

You can't. It's encrpyted. You didn't encrypt it so that your adversary could mount it in Ubuntu. On the contrary, you encrypted it so that none can mount it. It may be telling you that /dev/sda1 is ntfs, maybe that's what's still written to the MBR but your encryption software doesn't care about the MBR table. If you could boot from another HD with Windows installed, it wouldn't mount this partition either. What is written there is not a valid ntfs filesystem. It's something that only SafeBoot can understand after you give it your password. Whether SafeBoot provides linux drivers that can read data from /dev/sda1 and make it available as a transparent ntfs filesystem, I don't know. I googled a bit and didn't find it. PS: If SafeBoot indeed doesn't provide support to mount it under Ubuntu, which I believe is the case, perhaps you could try VirtualMachine solutions. 

Both mirrors have the same importance/priority. Files may be changed on either computer, and they may also be deleted. You want to propagate the changes to the other mirror. You don't want deleted (or renamed!) files to be restored back, on the contrary you want to propagate the deletion, and will mess it up. If you change a file in both mirrors, or change it on one mirror and delete on the other, you don't want any of these to be propagated automatically. You want to work that out by yourself. 

If you are going to use some smart software for the backup, do not use FAT (unless you never ever travel between timezones and there is no daylight saving time where you live). NTFS properly stores the universal time when a file was modified and computes what that time means in your city to display it accordingly. FAT simply stores a number, which is usually the local time (and I don't know how to make it store something else with Windows). So, if you ever have to set you clock, files that were perfectly synchronized between FAT and NTFS will cause you terrible headache. Some applications can be set to ignore timestamps that differ exactly by a few hours, but in the end you have trouble. 

Warning: In any case, unless you just got this laptop, there is already lots of stuff written to your hard disk. I found a bunch of stuff in mine and nothing would clear it out. You need to make a backup to another drive or partition, overwrite your current filesystem with zeros, and restore your files (of course, only restore the sensitive files after the encryption is set up). 

If you simply forget about command line and mount with Nautilus, it should set it as you want. From the terminal, the permissions of the folder before mounting doesn't matter. It's the mount options that count. Try: 

In linux I do it all the time, even when I just want to run a graphical application logged as another user but inside my desktop session: 

As far as I know, even tracking files is not really really secure. Files get (physically) written here and there... they get out of control. If it's really that sensitive to you, better mount /home/username/.mozilla directly as an encrypted filesystem (e.g. encfs or ecryptfs). Instead of deleting, what you will do is you will create a brand new filesystem with a brand new encryption key, copy the current profile from a mounted with the sqlite file, and securely delete the encryption key of the previous filesystem. Without the key then it's really garanteed never to be recovered. (I'm assuming Firefox really enforces that this database file will not contain traces of the stuff you have deleted.) Sorry, your question is about a user-friendly approach, and my answer is that even the non-user-friendly methods may be unsecure depending on what level of security you need. 

I don't like Grub2, I think it completely took the control out of the hands of those users who have limited tech knowledge. However, I realized that struggling to keep GrubLegacy is like swimming against the drift. It's not maintained. You will get less and less help in your endeavor. Now back to your case: It's working well, leave it as it is. When it doesn't, upgrade it. 

Linux distributions take a lot of care with , and you really should be careful before playing with it. Be specially careful about adding paths like "" or , it is unsecure. One of the dangers of adding paths is that it opens for the possibility of files on these paths getting executed by , opening a windows in the system security that may be exploited by malicious software. There may be other dangers. Just make sure you know what you are doing. Bypassing security measures may render your Solaris as safe as Windows XP. 

If it's ext4 then it has uid, gid and permissions, even at the root. From what you say, it suggests that the root directory of the /dev/sdb1-filesystem belongs to root. You could try three possible solutions: 

If you have access to at least three different computers then using a cloud is enough for your purposes. The cloud will serve as backup too. If all you want is to copy bookmarks from machine A to machine B, you can use the cloud as well. A popular one, though not open-source, is xmarks. 

Give a simpler password than yours. Remember to forbid on , in case you have installed an server. If your horrible password is to protect your files, then they are really protected only if they are encrypted, otherwise this is just "security theater". Assuming this is why you wanto to keep the big one, you will be safe: breaking 's password still won't be enough to decrypt your files, and any kind of malware will fry our CPU before guessing the password. 

System -> Adm -> Users and Groups, When you select a User, you can go to Advanced Settings and choose access options. Recall that if a user can use sudo, they can do anything else afterwards. 

I'm assuming you are not mounting anything on the top of /home/me, like an encrypted home for instance. You didn't say either if you will always have this device plugged when you boot. If you want to have a "hot-pluggable Music folder" then you should expect that Gnome will show it as a pluggable device. 

Yes, you can. No special skills needed. There is a script to do it, and also an outstanding tutorial that not only tells you what to do but also helps you in understanding what is being done. 

If you choose to go Luks then your task is even harder, and you will need to know exactly how much ahead the dm-crypt data should be with respect to the begining of the official partition. In any case, if your system crashes or halts during the procedure you loose your data 

Just replace ext4 defaults,user 0 2 by ext4 defaults 0 0, reboot and see what happens. Change the owners and permissions of this partition (if mounted, sudo chown me:me /home/me/Music && sudo chmod 755 /home/me/Music) Mount /dev/sdb1 elsewhere, like /mnt/foo, create a directory called Music inside it, and mount /mnt/foo/Music in /home/me/Music in bind mode. If it works well, this is the fstab: 

Is it possible to disable ACPI Suspend in Windows XP? I don't mean the "Control Panel, Power Settings,..., choose never to sleep, actions on button, choose 'ask me', actions on close lid, choose 'no action', etc..." solution. [1] I mean totally disable the suspend functionality, the same way I can totally disable Hibernation by uncheking a box inside a tab in Power Settings that is made for this purpose. [1] That takes a long time to do and somehow stops on several other annoyances, such as this setting not being properly propagated to each user account. 

When you reinstall Ubuntu you can keep your home folder, with ALL your settings, files, etc. Just don't format any partitions and your /home will be kept. In particular, your private authentication keys are preserved. 

Under normal conditions: If you want to protect it from yourself, meaning accidental operations, this is enough. No decent command like can possibly cause to be deleted. To cause damage there must be two things: , and either or . Now, if the problem is someone else that has access to your computer, you must either trust that they won't use the words and , or not give them an admin account in first place. With an admin account they can do whatever they want. Another level of protection in this case is to enter BIOS setup, forbid booting from CD/USB, and password-protect the BIOS setup itself. 

Backup Have at least 3 devices including your computer. 4 is even better. They should all be working and reasonably up-to-date. They should never be all together at the same place. If one of these policies are violated, hurry up and to get it fixed. If they are all at the same place, take one of them elsewhere as soon as you can. If one of them is corrupted, replace it. A simple solution is to leave one HD at work. Once in a while you take another HD to your work and on the same day you bring back the one that you had previously left there. At home you keep them synchronized with Unison. No headaches. No data loss. Happiness. Encryption If you care about encryption, take into account that is is really effective only if you encrypt your device before you store anything at all in it. If something has already been written there in the past, overwrite the whole device with zeros before you restart. If you use Linux and like GUI, I recommend you format it with the Gnome Disk Utility and simply check the encryption box. Easy and safe. 

In Ubuntu, does preserves some variables. is more like logging in as root and then running the command. Both may be inconvenient, the former for leaves root-owned files inside your home and the latter for will try to open /root/myfile. 

This will set files to and folders to . If you want other user/group and permissions, for instance to copy files from fat32 to the ext4 partition with the desired attributes, better consult the manpage. Roughly you put on the opposite of what you would put on . 

Complementing Alpha1's answer, if the data is bigger than 2GB and you want to do it without dropbox-like services, Unison is the solution for you. Unison is the only reliable tool that I know for this task. It will do the right thing even in corner cases, even if your comptuer crashes. 

If you are only worried about losing your laptop, Ubuntu has already set up for you. Just choose "encrypted home directory" when you create your user account and give it a decent password. This will protect whatever is inside your home folder. Yes, it will encrypt more than , but it's seamless. For the use . Pros: 

In practice the answer is a bold Yes. With so many developers of all kinds, so many automated tools to generate the installation files, installing and loading the libraries, etc etc etc, and most important, the absolute lack of a culture of respecting the machine's owner's decisions above everything else when developing software (perhaps due to the Operating System itself being designed for users who don't want to take such decisions in first place, plus the fact that there is in general no open source so that people could look in it and say "hey, com'on, you'r installing useless s%#t to my system core", etc) lead to a de facto consequence which is this bold yes. In theory there may be Windows software that can be installed, uninstalled, and leave absolutely no change in it. We could even try to make a list of such. I assure you they are insignificantly few. One could indeed possibly say, though, that it's not directly MS's fault. It's arguable.
