I'm having trouble finding a way to transfer a file from dir1/file to dir2/ using sftp protocol. I"ve tried because I need to provide password non-interactively, and public/private keys aren't available for me. 's is available, but it requires public/private key auth. I cannot use 's , , or . In the man page, seems promising: 

Using vim (or vi) I want to align the sections with to the same column number. What's the easiest and fastest way to do this? (ignore the ugly bits for now) 

Puppet is a configuration management software which is capable of configuring a fleet of servers automatically by reading Puppet Manifests files. Such a file could include a definition of your /etc/sudoers file, which can then be pushed out to all your puppet "agents" from your puppet "master". Then all hosts will get the same copy of your /etc/sudoers file, which can (and should) include HOST definitions, so you can grant some users some commands on some hosts (but not on others). 

try the Chrono extension for chrome. In Options there is a field which lets you change the simultaneous number of downloads. $URL$ 

has -C, --directory DIR: change to directory DIR. Does pax have something similar? This can be useful for backing up directory structures/hierarchies in a relative fashion, such as , instead of , or restoring from inside a directory other than $TARGET_DIR. I normally use pax in ustar (default) format, or sometimes cpio. 

Re-download the book from the store you bought the book from and observe that you just get a file instead of a file. Instead of inspecting the contents of this file to get a link to a file, you will have to open the file in Adobe's "Digital Editions" software (which is a horrendous piece of crap, by the way). After opening the file, Digital Editions will put a working file in on Windows. It probably does something equivalent in MacOS, use your intuition to figure out where it might put the file. Run the scripts mentioned on the Circumventing Adobe ADEPT DRM for EPUB page on this file. 

It could be that you're using inside of Tmux or Screen. Tmux and Screen a terminal multiplexers that spawn multiple "screens" that you can easily switch between in a single terminal. For some reason unknown to me, running inside of Tmux never works, and emits the error . Run it inside of a normal shell and it will probably work just fine. 

I was wondering if there's any way to turn off monitors independently, without having to physically press a button on the monitor, of course. A program that tells the other monitor to display nothing but black would suffice, but I'd really prefer not to waste the power. I also have Nvidia TwinView, so applications like aren't aware of both monitors as being independent. 

I just upgraded to Ubuntu 10.4 from 9.10, and it's now hiding the hibernate and suspend options. How do I get them back? So the way you do this is make sure that your swap partition is in /etc/fstab and swap is enabled, and big enough. Look at to see if anything is listed. Now I'm getting this error when I boot after suspending: 

It can be done with other tools, but I am interested to know how can I delete all but the last X lines of the file with . 

I have been reading the rsync man page, but I'm not clear on whether I should use the --backup-dir option or the --copy-dest option I'll have a command similar to 

I want to transfer directories and files under 'company?' non-recursively. This (so far) appears to do what I am after: 

dir1, dir2, and dir3 contain many directories that I do not want copied. Copy on the remote host to /dirB maintaining the same directory structure. I tried: 

I have an old IDE drive with windows 7 installed on it. I disconnected that drive, and installed a new windows 7 to a new drive (SSD). I want to extract data from the old drive. However, the problem I am having is, when the drive is connected to MoBo, windows wants to boot from this drive. The BIOS is crap, and doesn't allow me to arrage the order of the various hard drives on the system. I want to stop this drive from booting. Can I erase the booting information on its partitions, or on or near the MBR. I, like many people, struggle to repair the windows booting information, not destroy it. I know I "could" use an external enclosure to read its data. But this is a good way to learn something new. I am familiar with GNU/Linux, so if there is a known method of using it to solve my issue, that will be fine. Thanks 

It overwrites , and the password it prints doesn't work anyway. Does anyone know how to set the password properly? I don't want to disable it. 

There are lots of suggested parameter lists out there for ffmpeg to encode iPod Touch video, but I thought I'd subject the question to SuperUser.com to get some good answers. How do you encode iPod videos with ffmpeg? The best answers should explain why they are using specific parameters. 

I'm trying to associate a specific action with a file type in Firefox 3.0. When I go to Edit > Preferences > Applications, there is no way to add a file type, such as MP3. I can edit existing file types and their behaviours, but I can't add any new ones. There are instructions that say to click Edit > Preferences > Content > File Types > Advanced button, but I think that's for a different version of Firefox, because it's not actually there in 3.0. Is there a way to do this on the fly, when I click a link? Is there a clever extension that makes this relatively simple thing finally easy to do? 

I just got rid of pulseaudio because it breaks in so many different situations. I've switched to Alsa, and all of my sound is working except in mpd. It seems like I have to set in . Here is my config file: 

I'm using Thunderbird 2.0.22, the version that comes with Ubuntu Intrepid 8.10. When I hit "Reply" or "Write", a new email window pops up, but it ends up being under the main Thunderbird Window, and doesn't have focus. Thunderbird is the only application that exhibits this weird behaviour, and it just started happening one day, whereas it worked fine before. I've seen this problem years ago as well, and wasn't sure how I fixed it. 

I'm writing bash shell scripts with Unix line endings using notepad++. However, the final line never contains a new line. I must manually create it by pressing "enter" and having a blank line in my document. How can I configure Notepad++ to always have a newline (line feed) at the end of all lines? 

I'm trying to sync a large tree on Linux, but include and exclude certain files/directories. My question is regarding rsync's --relative option and how relative paths are handled. Directory structures appear something like: 

I installed Notepad++ 6.0 and the Explorer Plugin. When I right click a file in the side window, I don't get options for TortoiseSVN. When right clicking on a file in Windows Explorer, I do see options for TortoiseSVN. Any ideas on why this might be? 

I'm trying to copy the contents of a series of directories non-recursively to another remote system. 

I had to add a static route to my wireless router BACK to the 192.168.2.0/24 network via 192.168.1.103 (laptop). Now windows can browse web via lappy! SOLVED 

I'm trying to determine if sed is faster reading from stdin (with shell redirection < ) or by specifying the file from which sed should read. I didn't find a definitive answer on Google. Which is faster? 

server1 has a filename.tgz and I need to copy it to server2. I would like to keep daily copies on server2, like: 

edit: I want to extra and and directory contains directory with 20 files. I want to extract only member and and directory and copy them to another "remote_host" using ssh/scp. Can this be done as a one-liner? I considered using , , or but I guess I'm not very skilled with these utilities yet. 

I've been having some issues with Windows 7 lately and have scoured as many relevant forum threads Google can muster up -- but to no avail. The problem seems somewhat common among users, but each potential solution seems to go off in a completely different direction than the next so here I am making my own customized post and seeking your expert advice. The problem is this: randomly, when running any application (even just Event Viewer or the file browser, but also when using Chrome, Skype, Adobe products, etc.), my computer will freeze for anywhere between 30 seconds to 1.5 minutes. I usually notice my system is going to lock up when internet tabs stop loading -- I see the loading wheel in the Chrome tabs and I know the program is about to hang. Shortly after one application begins to freeze, most of the other applications I click on/mess with freeze too. Interestingly, for programs that are recording or outputting sound (Skype calls, YouTube videos, iTunes) will continue to play/record sound so long as I don't touch them. Once a minute or two has gone by, the entire system frees up again and all the applications continue as normal -- all at the same time. ...

Keeping Event Viewer and Task Manager open at all times to observe behavior during freezes -- I've looked through all (yes, all) of the logs under Applications and Service Logs/Microsoft/Windows and the only section that had anything that matched the timestamp of the latest freeze was the "CAPI2" Operational log. Lot's of "Information" level entries and one or two "Error" entries. When applicable, I've copied the URLs in the "Details" tab of the "Error"-level entries, downloaded the file, right-clicked, and chosen "Install CRL". I've always restarted my computer after installing any CRL files. Nothing's fishy in Task Manager during these freezes either. About 80-88% from System Idle Process, 13% from svchost.exe, and maybe 8-12% from Chrome during the most recent freeze. I'm guessing you'll want to see those CAPI2 entries, so just let me know of the best way to dump that information. ... Any and all help/suggestions are appreciated. I will gladly run any necessary tests thrown at me and will report back results (just make sure I know how to report/dump the results). Much obliged, Alex the Computer Novice 

And their on-board sound things both crackle, pop, and have bad treble when compared to a Sound Blaster Live 5.1 plugged in to the exact same motherboard, running Linux, using the emu10k1 driver. In all tests I was outputting to a set of Klipsch Pro Media Ultra 5.1 speakers. Why might this be so? Specifically to that test, and in general? How would one determine if this motherboard, for example, is comparable to a Sound Blaster Live 5.1?: VIA VB8003 Mini-ITX Mainboard: "VIA VT1708B 8 channel HD codec" 

And I hear the song play for less than a second before the audio_output driver is closed. There really aren't any error messages printed explaining why it's not working. I've also tried "oss", "esd" and "ao" for the audio_output type, and none of them work. Does anyone have any idea how to configure mpd for Alsa? 

Log in to MSN on a Windows box. (I know, it hurt me too) Find that user, and delete them, their account is probably closed anyway Your Pidgin should work fine again. 

I'm running Firefox 3.0.14 32-bit on Ubuntu 9.10 32-bit. It's much slower than in Windows XP on the same machine. Does anyone know why? Also, what's a possible way to improve the performance? (Please list optimizations as their own answer, so they can be rated independently.)
