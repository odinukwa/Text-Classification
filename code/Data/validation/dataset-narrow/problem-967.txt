I don't know for sure if this will work, as I haven't done it, but i've seen emails with the wrong date/time, and this is the way i'd think it happened technically, so this has a chance. If you set up your own smtp server with whatever date/time, that might do it, and cause the email program or web interface to use/see that date/time. Email headers would give the prank away but it could work. I have seen email with the wrong date/time, that includes wrong year. There are other servers in the route, you can't set up the To person's POP server, and headers will give the prank away, if they check the headers. But as i've seen emails with the wrong year, and it has been from either a spammer(with the wrong year) or emails with the wrong time, from an individual I know, and it hasn't been all emails, so I know it must've been something at their end, i.e. seems like it must be their SMTP server. 

How can I determine which AGP Graphics cards or whether an AGP graphics card, is compatible with Windows 10? A friend's computer has an AGP graphics card that is not compatible with windows 10, i'd like to change it for another AGP graphics card, which he can get off ebay second hand(obviously since AGP is old). But i'd want the "new" AGP graphics card he gets to be compatible. How can I ensure that it will be compatible with Win10? 

Seems there is no such rule settings in Outlook client. If your mail system is Exchange server, try the Exchange Transport rule. It can block the emails before the specified messages arrive to the recipients' mailbox, and give the sender an Non-Delivery Report to why the email was not delivered successfully. Besides, it would be better if you can share more details about the right from address for the associated recipients, so we can try to give more specific suggestions :) 

The read status is synced to server side, so if this item is marked as read in one client and this client is connected to server, the status will be synced to other clients. You may set an Outlook rule on the manager's mailbox, to forward his received email to you. Or ask your Exchange admin to setup a transport rule to send a copy of the email to you once your manager is the recipient or one of the recipients. 

It's not recommended to uninstall the security updates if it is what you uninstalled. There is a known issue about Outlook search after June security update, it is fixed now. Please check the issue #5 in below article: $URL$ STATUS: FIXED Windows has released fixes via Windows Updates to address a reliability issue in Windows Search. Below are the relevant KB updates for each version: Windows 7 - KB4022168 Windows 8.1 - KB4022720 Windows 10 Version 1703 - KB4022716 Windows 10 Version 1607 - KB4022723 Windows 10 Version 1511 - KB4032673 Windows 10 - KB4032695 NOTE: The fix for this issue has been released on June 27, 2017. If you implemented the workaround, you can now set the PreventIndexingOutlook registry key to DWORD: 0 to go back to using Windows Search. 

If you want to know about networks, then given that you asked the question, you'd probably want to know about IPs Addresses and related topics - IP addressing schemes, subnetting.. And you'd want to know about Routing - particularly IP Routing. Nowadays CIDR is used, as you probably know, that's Classless addressing rather than classful, hence you ask your question.. It is still worth knowing classful addressing, if you want to know CIDR, since it will help you to understand the need for CIDR. Also, sometimes people still use the terminology of classful addressing. Furthermore, learning classful addressing is trivial compared to learning CIDR, and will not get in the way, and may even help. 

I'm not in front of it right now but there is a switch for tcpdump to list all interfaces, then you can specify specifically the one you want. Try then you can do e.g. or whatever particular interface you want to listen on. 

My educated guess based on something Computer science lecturer told us from a basic book but it matches what that wikipedia page on MMIO says. CPU doesn't know what device it is writing to. As far as it is concerned it may as well all be RAM-memory. Some devices use a particular RAM-memory location. I suppose that'd be what hardware mapped means. But there can be a memory location in the hardware device itself, there probably must be in fact.. to transfer the data to. The CPU doesn't have to wait it writes to the location in RAM which is mapped to a register on the devie. A register is a memory location in CPU or in a hardware device. not in ram. To be more specific to your question. A register is in CPU or in a hardware peripheral-device. Not in RAM/main memory. The location in RAM/main memory, is just called a location never a register. A location in CPU or a peripheral device isn't generally called a location or memory location, and is always called a register, that's its special and proper name. If a register is mapped to memory as no doubt many hardware peripheral device registers are, then i'd be pretty sure that is what is meant by a memory-mapped register. So, If a hardware register isn't memory mapped.. e.g. if the CPU writes to it directly then it's not memory mapped. It seems from that wikipedia article that maybe if those addresses are located in a special space and they require special pins or a special bus then the locations may be in memory, but not MMIO, not memory mapped. Looking at that wikipedia page.. PMIO i.e. considered to not be memory mapped. Is when CPU registers are not mapped to regular memory locationss, but to a special address space. So rather than a general purpose CPU register that can write to a device or memory, depending on what address is put on the address bus. With PMIO, (i.e. not a memory mapped register), the register is mapped to a device specific memory location which I guess they are calling a port. 

The reason or error code/message in the bounce message is the key to resolve this issue. Some codes in non-delivery report for your reference. How about sending the emails from web mail in browsers? If you experience the same issue when sending from web mail, the issue might be the mail system related. Contact your mail system admin for assistant. However, the content of the bounce message is still the key point. 

General troubleshooting steps: 1.If the same mailbox accounts can be setup successfully on other PCs, and no mailbox accounts can be setup successfully on these two PCs, then the issue is related to these two PCs. In this situation: 1). Check the proxy settings on the PCs. Run netsh winhttp show proxy to check if you have any proxy setting. If there is, run netsh winhttp reset proxy to remove the proxy setting, then reboot the PC and try again. 2). Collect the fiddler log when the issue is reproduced, compare with the normal log when the profile can be successfully created. 2.If other mailbox accounts can be successfully setup on these two PCs, and the two mailbox cannot be setup successfully on any PCs, then the issue would be the mailbox account related. In this situation, run Microsoft Remote Connectivity Test, see if there is any error. Also, try to login OWA with these two mailboxes. If they are two new mailboxes, and either of logging OWA or Outlook fails, try to recreate the accounts. 

This may be a bug in grep 2.5.4 If you have a choice between gnuwin32 grep or cygwin grep, cygwin grep is far more up to date. -V shows version and year, and that as of writing - gnuwin32 grep is version that's 2009. Years behind. cygwin grep is years ahead of gnuwin32 grep. (that's later than 2.5.4 because 2.21 is not like one arithmetic number with a decimal point) and the year of cygwin's grep is 2014. 

yeah but B needs A's public key to be listed in B's authorized_keys file in order for A to be able to connect to B also you can delete id_rsa.pub and ssh to B and it will still work, because the public key is generated fresh with each ssh connection and not stored in any id_rsa.pub 

You have to match the whole thing and capture the part you want. So you have to match the whole thing in such a way that you split it just so to get what you want. will match everything it can then try with that to have an _ after it. So the .* will eat up many underscores too. But not the last one. Because the _ after it must match an underscore. So that matches vendor_reg_analysis_ Now you have matched up to just before 'healthcare.xls' This part 

In this scenario, it's recommended to sync your work emails via Outlook client other than Mail APP on Windows 10, or you just access and handle emails in OWA on your own desktop. It's high risk that your computer is reset and most data were lost unexpectedly. As Microsoft states: In addition to resetting the mobile phone to factory default condition, a remote device wipe also deletes any data on any storage card that's inserted in the mobile phone. If you're performing a remote device wipe on a mobile phone in your possession and want to keep the data on the storage card, remove the storage card before you initiate the remote device wipe.

It would be the category on the message before you got this message in your Outlook. So it is listed as Not in Master Category List. Similar thread for your reference: $URL$ 

I think I understand what you would like to see, but there is no such function or feature in current Outlook clients. :( UserVoice is a way to submit the feedback. More votes, more opportunity to bring Outlook product group's attention. :) 

What are you talking about You say "both" but your picture shows Four. And only one of those 4 has an IP from the ISP, though even that could be set statically e.g. if the ISP gives you a static IP you could get it by DHCP from the ISP, or set it yourself. 

Start a voice call only; the sliders should then be active Request the other persons webcam once voice is active. When you can see their cam, send your own. 

I am very familiar with a computer being noisy and it being too expensive to make it cooler.. (though nowadays this is not such an issue). But the solution to this has always been a KVM Extender It moves the box further away from the monitor and keyboard. By the way, old computer science books call the CPU the box.. But since then people call the CPU the processor. You refer to the box. If you were extending VGA and USB separately, that might be OK too. And by the way.. I have a 50" VGA cable, works perfectly. It was very thick.. maybe that was why. I heard of a guy with a 50" VGA cable that didn't have good results. And I guess you don't need to extend the power cord ;-) though if you did I guess a retractable power cord type thing would do it. Best way i've found to extend USB, if your KVM Extender doesn't, is a Cat5 USB Extender. Another way but not as good, is USB can be extended at 5M intervals with USB Boosters. Each one plugs into a mains power source. 

OST files are always copies of items that are saved on a mail server, which cannot be used as backup. As Ramhound suggested, you can create a local .PST and copy the emails to it. Or setup a rule to move a copy of the message you received(or certain type of emails you want to backup) to the PST file. Introduction to Outlook Data files: $URL$ 

This is a known issue. And Microsoft are working on the fix. Just wait for the coming updates, or closely monitor the below threads: $URL$ $URL$ 

Not sure if your mail system is Exchange server. To Exchange organization, if the organizer's mailbox attributes have been changed due to mailbox recreating or other reasons, the organizer will not be able to update the meetings he setup before. Because it's no longer the original organizer. In above situation, you may ask the Exchange admin to search these meetings and delete them in batches from server side, then the organizer recreates the meetings. 

Each kind of mailbox has its own folder structure, such as Exchange account, Outlook account, GMAIL account. I suppose you add other accounts by adding accounts in current Outlook profile. Even in this scenario, each mailbox use its own Outlook profile and structure, as they are on different mail system or mail server. Outlook just behaviors as what it should do.
