Yes. You can do it using the command Rasdial. Thought i recommend you to configure the VPN using a Group Policy. You can see the procedure here: Configure a Virtual Private Network Connection Item 

Do it for your tests. That is a really intersting question. Teorically you cannot do this, you cannot install VMWare EsXI or Hyper-V in a Virtual Machine. This is because they are hypervisor, bare metal sofware, that means, virtualization software that runs directly on the hardward without a host OS, as you can imagine it has lots of performance advantages. However looks like in VMWare are really genius working and now you can do it, Since VMWare Worksation 8. (in earlies versions is not possible). 

We are planning to sign with DKIM emails for multiple domains. Each domain will have a CNAME to a DNS entry in a common domain where the keys are stored. If every domain sign with the same key, but off course using different domain and selector, all of them will created independent reputation? If one domain is marked as spammer will affect the deliverability of the other domains? They are completely different and uses a differnt selector. Just shared the key. 

There is no specific entry in Apache error.log, but it seems that the problem occurs because the Auth requirement is evaluated before the Rewrite, thus invokes the ErrorDocument and that is wrongly still http?? 

Possibly other variants exist as well. There is of course one important point: Don't shoot yourself in the foot! For example, 

A Windows 2008 R2 machine reboots automatically every now and then, typically on Fridays afternoons. The reboots are "announced" in the event log as follows: 

In an Apache 2 vhost I have the following configuration (in my case, in of the document root (which is for simplicity the same for http:80 and https:443) 

In my Windows network with all AD servers (still) running Windows 2003, I encounter the following problem: The "Maximum password age" policy apparently does not apply. Even though some of the users have indeed been asked to change their password regularly, apparently very many are not asked to do so. A quick LDAP search for users with two years(!) ago, three weeks ago, and (this cryptic condition means especially that the checkbox is not checked) gives me a list of about 70 (!) users. I might manually request them to change their passwords upon next logon, but I would prefer to see the password age policy do its work (and I left them unmodified precisely to get an indication of the policy working). I thought I knew where to configure this: in the Default Domain Policy under Maximum password age, period. I mad the following out of desperation, which according to the docs should not have helped (but at least it should not harm either, should it?): Since the setting in the "Default Domain Policy" - apparently - had no effect, I addtionally made corresponding settings in about all policy objects that might have influence under various circumstances, that is "Default Domain Controllers Policy", "[COMPANY] Domain Policy", "[COMPANY] DC Policy", "[COMPANY] Computers Policy" (the names suggest their scopes quite well, I guess)but nothing helped. To give an overview: People log in first to their PC, which can be about any version of Windows, from 8.1 down to a few even still running XP (and in the process of being dumped). Here they either work locally or, mostly, login to RDP servers, which all run Windows 2008R2; this latter login is additionally governed by a specific "[COMPANY] TS Loopback Policy", in which I also added the maxpassword age setting - without success. And after all, already the login to the local PC should have triggered an expiry. In other words, I have no idea what could be the problem behind this and woould greatly appreciate help. Meanwhile this has been background-bugging me for a few months now and in fact now it is becoming a growing pain in the neck (see the actual password ages discovered in the first paragraph!!). While we eagerly want to migrate the AD version and this might resolve the prblem as a side-effect, we would be much happier if this problem could be resolveed before starting that migration (and possibly importing a deeply hidden problem). 

In the Hyper-V Manager you should not see anything. You should connect to the virtual machine by RDP to see it working. 

This is not exactly what you need but if are in Windows 7 a really good alternative is to change the location of the Libraries. By this method you save Documents, Pictures, etc but not all the profile in the D drive. Last night i created a tool that may be useful for you: Set Libraries. 

Why do you want this? Windows doesn't allow to have dots in the computer name. No matter if you are in a domain or on a workgroup. The thing is that where you are in a domain your computer full name is something like: computername.yourdomain.com. Your full, but the computer name continus being computername. This longer name is known as FQDN (Full qualified domain name) or absolute name and is use to specified the computer location in the tree hierarchy of the Domain Name System (DNS). When you are in a workgroup unlike domains DNS does not work for internal resolution, thats why you don't see a FQDN. But have in mind that a PC never has dots in his name. Regards. 

One of my users found a message in his Sent Items folder and claims he has not written it. The (external) recipient address exists and is knwon to us (though said user doesn't know it and had no contact so far), the subject is appropriate and very specific to that recipient address (and to no other recipient), the mail body contains a single word "Einverstanden" (German for "agreed"), which looks like a rply to something, but isn't. This looks a bit strange (though not strange enough to suspect malware) Is there any way to find out in greater detail how the mail was actually produced? (Which Client on which computer / OWA / smart phone with ActiveSync / other user with "Send As" privileges / ...) While "internet headrs" are very informative for inbound mail, the corresponding field is (logically) empty for this outbound mail ..., EDIT: Thanks to hints in the comments I found more logs than I knew before. Here's what I found: 

We have a LAN with Cisco switches, redundant cabling and spanning tree. If I understand it correctly, when I pull out a redundant cable (that is currently "used" by the spanning tree) it takes several seconds until the spanning tree converges in reaction. How can I prevent this packet loss (assuming of course I know beforehand that the cable will be pulled)? That is, how can I make the spanning tree adapt "proactively"? I would have guessed that an interface plus waiting a couple of seconds should suffice, but did not dare to try that out yet. Actually, I am afraid an interface shutdown would cause the same interruption times during convergence because I suffered from such an interruption yesterday when makeing a supposedly harmless configuration change at some interfaces. (Edit: I just confimed this experimentally; as expected there was some 20 seconds of interruption after interface shutdown - note that I am looking for a "lossless" soluiton, not just "less loss") 

AS Jscott says you can configure it and i will operate perfectly without System Center Configuration Manager but you will lose the reports and alerts components. 

You can do it using the Windows Server 2008 R2 resource monitor. Run perfmom.exe and select Open Resource Monitor, go to the tab called Disk, and check the section called Disk Activity. There you can order by Read and Write bytes per second and one of the colums of that table is the file which are being accessed. Regards. 

Yes. This is true. Ports are to bind and the apps with the network. You cannot have more than 65553 application connected by TCP and 65535 connect by UDP on the same host. Operating Systems tipically dinamycally managed the ports an assign one for each app that connects to the network. If you have two applications listeing on the same port when a network package arrives the computer couldn't know to what app is going to deliver the data. As example if you have Messenger and Skype on the same binded to the same port your messenger message will appear in skype and vice versa :) 

This is not a DNS problem (although there is one problem: I get "... has no A record" instead of 204.232.175.78). What you observe with is caused by a http redirect (). 

This handshake should look similarly wrong for any TCP connection to the cluster, not specifically for ssh. (And in fact the same problem should occur for udp). Can yuo confirm (by sniffing) that other (working) services continue the handshake with the virtual address or with one of the member addresses? (Sorry, this should be a comment, but I can't) 

Yes, On the file server: In "server manager", "roles", "file services", right click "manage shares and memory", "manage open files". You can do so also remotely if you run server manager elsewhere and right-click connect to a remote server. Normally, hardly anyboday besides an Administrator can do that and should not do so lightly (with great power comes great responsibility). 

It is plausible tha the updates in the last point were waiting for a reboot. In fact, I found an event #22 ("Reboot necessary, computer will reboot in 15 minutes) on 2013-05-16 03:14:28 mentioning precisely the updates mentioned in the post-reboot events. However, why didn't it reboot at 3:30 a.m. yesterday as the event mmessage suggests instead of 4 p.m today? By popular demand, the relevant policy settings under according to the GPO modeling wizard: 

There migh be an error in the communication from this new switch to the Domain Controller. The icon of public or domain network is managed by the Network Location Awareness (NLA) service. To detect if you are in your domain the NLA service do this two things: 

Is there any recommened array for placing the disks of a virtual infraestrcture. As example, I heard that for the OS disk is recommened a mirror array. For placing virtual hard dkis which is recommended? 

You have another issue in your code that maybe you haven't seen. Due the way you define the variable it wont be change when the DNS name isn't correct. Check it an define it using another technique. 

Other than the bad performance is completly possible to Install a Virtual Box virtual machine inside another virtual machine. Due VirtualBox doesnt virtualize Intel VT-X or AMD-V in its virtual machines and the VirtualBox requires those technolgies for run 64 virtual machines, the second Virtual Machine should be of 32 bits. 

Remote Desktop Connection (RDP). You can connect to a machine using the TCP 3389, view the desktop and do whatever you like. Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Almost everything in a Windows system can be manage through the MMC. You can open it using the command and in the menu File select Add or remove Snapin. The snap-in are DLLS created by the sofware manufacturers to manage their products. Windows comes with lots of them, for manage Disks, Users, Services, in a domain controller the Users and Groups, in a CA the certificates. When you add a snap-in you select if you want to manage the local system or a remote system. This requieres the 135 TCP port. You can save a console and the file extension is . Windows comes with lots of presaved consoles like , , , all of them save on . Remote command prompt. You can run a remote command prompt like you do with SSH using Telnet. This is not installed by default on Windows but you can install the client and the server using the server manager. This requieres the por 23. As you know Telnet is insecure and not reccomend because everythin is in plaintext. You have a really good alternative from Microsoft called PSExec that let you runs commands or open a remote command prompt without prior installation of anything and in a safe manner. Powershell Powershell is the new command line of Microsoft. It has a lot of advantages over the traditional command line. It was dessinged to work with Objects insted of plain text and you can do really powerfull things, this is the approach of Microsoft to compete with the famous terminal on the unix systems. You really should learn about it. Well, a lot of Powershell commands (Cmdlets) let you work in remote Systems. 

You need an entry in your Additionally, it may be necessary to modify the entries in the line , otherwise it may happen that works but applications (i.e. , , etc.) don't (or was it the other way round?). 

The arp table lists for each interface, which MAC is (directly or indirectly) reachable via that interface. That may be a single directly connected device per interface. If you have several switches, you should ignore the "trunk" lines between switches in your counting: Every MAC reachable indirectly via the connected switch wll be listed there. If you even have redundant links between your switches, a specific MAC may be listed only with one of several possible trunk links, depending on which link is currently considered best. Finally, note that a MAC may not be listed if no traffic with that device has passed the switch yet; typically, at least at boot time they will talk something to the net (e.g. DHCP) and thus "tell" their MAC. In summary: For interfaces with directly connected devices, your guess should be fine. Just make sure to drop info from links to wother switches. EDIT: While explaining the arp table in general, I missed the point of your final question: For a router the visibility of a MAC may be less prelevant: Since there will typically be a switch between the router and any other device on the connected LANs, a packet from that device will reach the router only if the device taklks to the router specifically (e.g. in order to reach another net via that router) or vice versa. Thus a router may never learn MACs of devices in the LAN that never bother to talk to any non-LAN host. 

Rules in the Windows Firewall can be bundle together and activated or deactivated as a group. With command you can add rules to the Firewall. Use the switch for manage the AdvFirewall groups. Use something like this: 

Yes. You are looking for the IANA IPv4 Address Space Registry. The IPv4 Address that are on the Internet are the ones who start of with one of the numbers what are Allocated in that table. 

For now you can see the activation status of your machines using the graphical Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT) 2.0 and from the tool you can force the inmediate activation towards the KMS Server. 

A NIC dedicated to Virtual Machines. A NIC dedicated for management, that means for be use to the host. A NIC dedicated for iSCSI. A NIC dedicated for heart beat. This is the internal traffic of the cluster. If you are planing to use Live Migraton you should dedicated a NIC for that. 

You are right. A lot of companies doesn't have a a public DMZ so they cannot have two public IPs in the server witouht NAT. Without this Teredo doesnt work. In Windows Server 2008 for enable Direct Access from the GUI you have to enable Teredo, so if you don't have this requierement it won't work. You have two alternatives: 

I guess there is a superfluous entry for laptop1 in your DNS server. Remove it manually. There may also be something coming from WINS. 

Most finds on the internet seem to match XP/2000/2003 instead and provided no help. What can be done (short of a complete reinstall)? 

I just noticed by pure chance that one of my Cisco 4500 switches has its clock going wrong: it is more than 2 minutes behind in spite of seemingly functional ntp. In my opinion, even a single second should not be considered acceptable for the systems involved. Also, I wouldn't have noticed the difference from diagnostics, had I not compared it to a simple wall-clock. Some details Here's ntp information for some of my hosts (10.0.99.1, 10.0.99.2, 10.0.1.119, 10.0.99.241) that are partly referencing one another for fallback, but mainly should all ultimately by syncing with 10.0.0.1, which again pulls the time from outside. So the time discrepancy cannot result from different original time sources. As the observations made me somewhat paranoid, "has correct time" in the following means: (or ) produced an output that matches my wall-clock and my local system clock (which is fine according to $URL$ with an error certainly below 1 seconds (accuracy of me hitting ENTER while watching my local clock) 10.0.1.119 (Ubuntu) has correct time
