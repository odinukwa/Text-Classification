After starting service, check your server is running at default port $URL$ You can set up media server from web interface. Then, install client application. You can find packages list at $URL$ Install application, then run squeezeslave, it will find your server. You can find more information about squeezeslave at $URL$ 

Look at this thread in raspberrypi.org : $URL$ In thread user 'pageauc' pointed a python script to detect motion. In the script, developer use difference in sensivity of image. Count the changed pixels then if bigger than threshold. Steps for checking; 

If you have error like 'FATAL: Module r8192cu not found.' that means you haven't r8192cu module installed. You have to install it first. Please look at that document : $URL$ 

You can find which HTTP server running on your Pi with in different ways. Because we interest with HTTP server, we looking for port 80. It's default port for web services but it can be change by administrators. with netstat command; 

to use crontab in correct way, you should give full path to run interpreter or set PATH variable before cron lines. Also, you should use && instead ; . 

Enabling the RPi OTG USB Serial Console Service In order to use the OTG Serial port as a console, you will need to enable the service on the RPi. If you have a GNU/Linux host machine, this can be done directly on the miniSD card as detailed above. However, it can also be done by booting the Raspberry Pi with keyboard and monitor attached. Then enable the serial console service: 

In order to get recording to work from my USB headset, which may be approximately the same... as long as the default sound card drivers work... I needed to select device 1 as follows: 

Plug your modified miniSD card into your Pi. Plug in your power cable. Wait 60 seconds. Plug in your USB cable into your Raspberry Pi and your PC. Run on your GNU/Linux machine and wait until you see the serial device register as something like Open a serial terminal program such as . Change your serial device in the program to match your OTG registered Pi. Press Enter 2 or 3 times and wait a few seconds. 

1a) If you bought SD card w/ OS installed inside, maybe you don't have to use cable or monitor. Just connect Pi to your router via ethernet cable, then find what ip address assigned to Pi, then connect via SSH. But if you want to use GUI desktop, you have 2 ways. i) Get a cable/converter/screen ii) Install x11vnc on Pi through SSH which explained above, then run x11vnc server on Pi. After running x11vnc service, you can get Pi's GUI screen through a VNC connection. 1b) Raspberry Pi has 2 different way to connect to screen/monitor/TV. HDMI and RCA, so if you have RCA cable and your screen/monitor/TV has RCA connector ($URL$ you can use it to connect. I have a setup with RCA cable to connect my old CRT TV. 2) What you need; * Raspberry Pi (Model B) * SD card (installed OS of course) * USB Keyboard * USB Mouse * RCA or HDMI cable to connect to screen/monitor/TV * Power supply (5v/1A) Optional; * Wi-fi adapter (choose known verified vendor/model : $URL$ * External powered USB Hub (in case you want connect more USB devices) Update: Of course you can use converters like DVI->HDMI. But think that, HDMI is digital, RCA is analog. I'm using a DVI-HDMI cable because my old LCD monitor uses DVI connection, but at work I'm using a HDMI->Display Port converter to connect my HP monitor with Display Port. Converters mostly works. 

Once upon a time, I wrote a few programs in Pascal. It used to be the Computer Science AP language as well... Fortunately, Pascal is supported on GNU/Linux distos through the Free Pascal Compiler. You can install it on the Raspberry Pi via: 

On exe's The executable format in GNU/Linux is the file format. However, most compiled executable programs have no extension. Any file can be executed if its execute bit is set in the file permissions. Usually a compiled program will have its execute bit set automatically by the compiler/linker. However, if you compile a Pascal program and it doesn't execute even after compiling without errors, you may need to set the execute bit as follows: 

And then change the root partition in your to You can do this on your Windows machine, just like you did to add the IP. 

So, it seems that is has two locations for with the user Remove the second one, and see what happens. 

And you would like to know why there are no interfaces listed even though you still have the WiFi dongle attached to the system... There are a few questions: 

Configure hostapd config file which is /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf Sample config should look like below. 

Use Simon Weber's gmusicapi python library to access Google Play Music First install gmusicapi and mplayer 

So, when i download a .torrent file into Raspberry, Transmission find the torrent in folder then download starts automatically. 2) JSON-RPC recipe: I use PERL script from $URL$ This PERL script watches a folder for .torrent files, then request Transmission's RPC interface and download starts. 

Rpi can't get dynamic IP address from your Windows7 laptop, because there are no DHCP server running on Windows 7. You have to set static IP address on Rpi which is in same network with Windows7 laptop. Step by step instructions. 1) Connect your Windows7 laptop to network via wireless ethernet adapter. Note the IP address. (Let's say its 192.168.1.10) 2) Give a static IP address to Windows7 wired ethernet adapter. This IP address should be on different subnet than wireless adapter. (Let's say it should be 10.0.0.10) 3) If you haven't monitor or TV that connected to Rpi, you should connect Rpi to your router temporarily to set static IP address on it. Let's say it should be 10.0.0.20) 

Since it seems that your is missing, you may want to fill it in with the necessary information. You'll need to manually mount the root and boot partitions first: 

Procedure to add CA Certificates Manually It's been awhile since I manually updated CA certs on a client machine. The following procedure worked on my Raspberry Pi running Raspbian Stretch: Create a local cert directory: 

The relay was designed to be operated with a +5V signal, according to its specification. The Raspberry Pi GPIO outputs 3.3V signals. So, this relay is not usable as is with the Raspberry Pi. You will need to either create an external transistor circuit that will control a 5V signal, or use a different relay board. 

Updates per comments The hostname for GNU/Linux systems, such as Raspbian, is set through the utility. You can change the host name for the Raspberry Pi via: 

It runs as service when the unit boots which restores the last known timestamp. This ensures the system time is not reset to the default beginning of UNIX EPOCH of 1970. The above program combined with the package, should keep a RPi reasonably close to the actual time depending on network access and reboot cycles. However, as pointed out in the comments, adding a RTC module will ensure accurate time keeping. So, it depends on your particular use case. 

You can use DAAP protocol to listen music from your Pi while not in your local network. For Pi, you have to install "mt-daapd" daemon to your Pi distro. Then use ssh port forwarding to add security. With ssh forward your port (6689 by default daap) and use any Daap client such as iTunes, MPOD for iPhone etc. I have wrote a blog entry realted to this issue, but sorry it's in Turkish :) $URL$ 

You can try to use Wowza Media Server stream to Web/iOS/set-top-box clients. Your Pi just will encode video from raspicam and send to Wowza Server via RTMP as FLV container. This command will send Pi's camera stream to Wowza with some parameters and it should work without problem. 

Then use my sample code. Any comments are welcome. I couldn't solve the 'device_id' problem in Mobileclient. 

Your RPi can't find correct 'boot device' when you plug your USB HDD. You can tell correct boot device name to Raspbmc installation via /etc/fstab file content like this. I'm using BerryBoot with 4 linux distributions installed on USB stick ant is my /etc/fstab content: proc /proc proc defaults 0 0 UUID=8208bc76-64af-4f8c-8fc0-96aa106f3dc2 / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 0 UUID="8E9420D19420BE19" /media/MAXTOR ntfs-3g defaults 0 0 UUID="D020C19620C183C6" /media/SAMSUNG ntfs-3g defaults 0 0 To find out UUID for devices use 'blkid' command. 

There are some shortcuts for path names. However, using the full path should be more error free for a beginner on UNIX like operating systems. I recommend reading through the Free Pascal Documentation, since there be some changes from what you are used to in other compilers. 

If you are looking at the guide linked to by @RichardChambers then the relay board has the transistor and the diode (the orange component with the clear packaging) listed in the relay control circuit. However, it's important to note that the transistor could be setup to follow reverse logic. The type of transistor will determine how the input functions. An NPN BJT configured as in the above guide, will follow normal logic. However, some other transistor might be used to change the input voltage sensitivity or perhaps the logic applied. 

You can easily experiment with adding a parallel capacitance. Simply solder a small value capacitor in across the C1 capacitor listed in the schematics. To lower the overall capacitance value, you'll need to replace the surface mount cap on the board since the board doesn't seem to have any pads to attach series capacitors. 

You can do this with Apache Rewrite Module. By default Apache comes with rewrite module installed, if don't please do this. 

Use Berryboot[1]. It's a bootloader that can install more than one OS into an USB flash disk. Berryboot has a feature like VNC to boot screen this could be what you want. You can connect through VNC when RPi booting, at this screen you can choose into OS what you want to boot. I'm using Berryboot with 3 OS installed. PiBang[2] as desktop with GUI, Moebious as server, Xbian as media server. At the boot sequence i can choose what OS going to boot. [1] $URL$ [2] $URL$ [3] $URL$ [4] $URL$ 

The append line adds extra options to the kernel command line in UNIX derivatives. You can add many extra options such as 

I guess your image is OpenELEC as @Lawrence said that. OpenELEC uses squashfs compressed image filesystem so you can't edit without uncompressing. To uncompress it, convert your sd-card content into image with dd command in another computer which runs linux. 

I am using a Python script and Dropbox to put pictures which taken by my RPi server to my dropbox account. So when RPi takes picture Dropbox sync it to my computer automatically. Also i am using a Pushbullet service call to inform me about taking a picture. (You need to login pushingbox.com and create a scenario for this.) You need 2 scripts; 1) dropbox_uploader $URL$ First, download then run dropbox_uploader to configure it. It will ask for your dropbox credentials and path for pictures. 2) shot-pushinbox-dropbox.py 

CA certificates are located in as well as and in some cases . In general CA certs should not be manually added to the local trust store. There are reasons why certain CAs are not included. Without further research, it's unclear why this particular CA root cert was not included in Raspbian. It seems to be included in my Debian 'Buster' installation running Brave Browser. All trusted CA certificates are added to a main trust store at . The main trust store is updated through either through: 

It's important to remember that the alias needs to be created in the proper user's environment. So, if you run as , you will need to create the alias in a shell. 

Here's a partial answer... It's Christmas Day, update later if it seems helpful. Building on my comment: Here's the external electronic circuit to go with the proposed systemd service file [TBD] 

If using the new hostname will be accessible at myhostname.local If is disabled, the new hostname will be accessible at myhostname.domain.tld as long as there is an entered in the DNS zone file. 

I am using Logitech Media Server (formerly SqueezePlug server) as a streaming server at my home. At my work laptop squeezeplug client installed. I believe that it's a better solution than DLNA. (I'm using DLNA to stream video to my TV by the way.) There is a installation document for Logitech Media Server: $URL$ Also; There are many solutions work as 'streaming server' to use on RPi. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ 

You can't run a program which need run on X via /etc/rc.local file. You should use LXDE autostart configuration. Commands globally executed are stored in the /etc/xdg/lxsession/{profile}/autostart file, and in addition, other commands can be locally specified in the ~/.config/lxsession/{profile}/autostart file. If both files are present, all the entries in both files will be executed. $URL$ • Create the folder /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE • Put a file named autostart in this folder, specifying the full path of the file to be executed: e.g. python /home/pi/pirun.py • Make the autostart file executable by chmod +x /home/pi/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
