Not really. Windows no longer adds transparency to their windows. Therefore, officially there is no way to do it. You could try this guide: $URL$ However, I am not sure if that works in the latest build. There also might be some third party apps, I'll try to find one after I'm done writing. Good luck. EDIT: Alright, you can look at this third party app as well. I can not vouch for it's security though. I have never tried it. Here is an article showing it off. $URL$ 

From what you have described, it does sound (no pun intended) like like a dying card. That is really the only thing that makes sense with a sound system that varies on how well it works. To check, you could try plugging in external speakers, and see if you can get sound to come out of those. If it does, and works well, then it is probably not the sound. If it doesn't work either, then it is probably the card. Luckily, as your laptop is quite old, it might be pretty easy to replace the card. :-) If you do the test and the speaker does work, drop a comment, I'll keep looking. 

Also, I want to point out that if you would like a linux-like enviroment for Windows you can use Cygwin. It brings the Linux Enviroment to Windows. You can use almost every command. Not sure how useful this is to you though. $URL$ 

I'm on a Mac Mini with OS X 10.8.2. I am an app developer, but in this case am building an app in C++, so I can not use Xcode for this question. I would like to track how much memory my app is using, but I don't want to manually record it. How do I do this. MORE INFO: I want to record it all day long. I will have the app running all day, so that I can compare peaks in memory. I am not opposed to 3rd party apps, as long as they are reliable. Thanks. 

Grub error 2 means "Bad File or Directory Type", the grub.conf is not set up properly. You may need to reinstall the Distro. You can also look at this site and see if it is of any help. $URL$ Anyway, something is clearly wrong with the boot loader. I can't help any more than that though. 

I am almost positive that it is not possible to do that when any modern monitors. The monitors have been made to scale lower resolution settings. There is no way you can force it to letterbox. Some older monitors did allow that, but I am not aware of any flat screens that can do that. However, simply lowering the resolution will increase performance. 

Anytime we re-install Windows pretty much all viruses will be removed. But really, you should be able to remove most virus without having to do anything to your computer. AVG Free is a really good security program that lasts forever, and seems to find every virus. That is what I use and we have never had to re-install Windows. AVG does a great job. AVG finds the corrupted files, replaces them, and will remove the original virus file. Now, that said, if you do re-install Windows and recover your files from a backup, then the executable file that caused the virus could still be there. If you have to recover your documents, be sure to run AVG or some other virus program BEFORE you do anything else. Regards, Ace Legend. 

Just another thought here. Firefox 17, which should launch on November 19 will have an inline pdf viewer. Therefore, you could download Firefox Beta if you don't want to wait. This allows you to have a pdf viewer without any extensions. $URL$ Obviously, this only applies to people who can and want to update their browser. 

I found that this isn't because is missing, but instead because of a change that needs to be made in . If I go into that file and replace with commands do work properly. So great! However, I can't because of this. I now get this error: 

Another idea is to do this: While you have Virtualbox in your dock right click on it, go to Options, and then click on "Open at Startup". Of course, this won't start the actual Virtual Machine automatically, but it will start Virtualbox. 

You could try running the installer on a Windows computer and then move the information from Program Files to your USB. Sometimes that provides you with all necessary files including the .exe. Other times programs are not as intelligent and require the installer to be used everytime. I would also suggest contacting the maker of DrRacket and see if they have a solution. Unfortunately, most programs will not work that easily. Most Java-based Apps can do this, but most of the time it is a no go. Installing is usually the only way to get this to work. But like I said, you can try copying the files from "Program Files" and see if that helps. Good luck. 

As for your question, here is what I know. When you are looking at the memory that is being used, it could be showing different kinds. Some computers will take some of the memory and move it to SWAP instead if using your RAM. It could also be using virtual memory, which takes up less space, thereby making your app seem like it is using less. If they are running on different OS's or versions, then that could contribute. For example, Windows XP might not handle memory the same way 7 does, which could slightly alter the amount of actual memory your app uses. Slight changes in graphic cards or other pieces of hardware can also contribute, by demanding memory from another app, but that doesn't usually happen on Windows, more so on Unix-based. As for the Mac, you are correct. OS X stores memory quite differently, and will use as much all RAM memory if it can, it will start to lower the amount when memory gets low. But the GPU sharing RAM is what is making it seem so high on that one. I am not the most knowledgeable in this subject, as I am also a software engineer, perhaps an electrical engineer (Or somebody with similar knowledge) could go into greater details. 

Well, your question isn't very objective, but I'll answer it anyway. It really depends. If you are a person that downloads things quite frequently, even from a secure source, then you might still want anti-spyware. Anti-Spyware has different uses than Anti-Virus. Spyware is much harder to detect, as it doesn't really behave like a normal virus. Spyware is meant to hide behind an actual application usually, that is why programs tend to detect it even if it is legitimate. Also, if you use your computer for storing important documents, then it might be worth the hassle. However, I would say for average use, it is quite unnecessary. Most anti-virus has some anti-spyware anyway. I will recommend AVG Free, probably the best Security program I have found for that price. 

Oh yes, this is a common firefox bug and is being worked on for future versions of Firefox. All of have to do is this: Go to Task Manager, click on processes, and find all firefox.exe processes. Then right click on them and choose "End Task", do that for all firefox.exe processes listed. Then open firefox again. 

So, I was using my laptop, which is indeed pretty old (Got it in '07). (As soon as I got it I replaced Windows Vista with XP.) Now, all of a sudden the computer powered off. The battery was almost dead when this happened. So, I plugged it in to charge it, and it has been charging for over 6 hours. Atlas, I went to turn it on, and the power light turns on for a second, then goes off. Nothing ever happens. I am assuming this is a battery problem, if so how would I go about replacing it? Also, if this could be something else I would be pleased to hear any suggestions. Thanks. EDIT See here: $URL$ 

Application: Application software, also known as an application or an app, is computer software designed to help the user to perform specific tasks. So, you are right. An application is something that the user interacts with. Process: A computer program is a passive collection of instructions; a process is the actual execution of those instructions. Several processes may be associated with the same program; for example, opening up several instances of the same program often means more than one process is being executed. Processes then, is what is actually making the application do something. Service: Local implementations in software. Basically, a service is something that is usually built into the OS itself, and is designed to not have any user interaction. Examples This is really how it works. You have an Application. You launch the application, the app is programmed to do things. How the app accomplishes that is by using processes. An app could use more if it wants to perform larger tasks. Meanwhile, say Windows or Mac has services running. These are things that other apps or only built in apps can handle. It is usually required to keep something running, but is not available without it. Keep in mind, a lot of people (Including Developers), will refer to their apps that run in the background as services. They are not. Only the OS itself can create services... Actually, services can be created, but they are usually meant to be used for many different kinds of apps. Hope that clears that up a little bit. If anyone has a correction let me know. 

Seems like one of your USB devices is randomly turning it on. Follow the first answer from the link provided by goblinbox. That explains how to fix the issue. 

I suppose you could store your files in a hidden folder. You just need to create .whateverfolder then it will be invisible to the most basic users. Not exactly hard for an advanced user to discover though. You could create an install script/bat file that sends the hidden folder to a system location e.g. \Windows\ALocation\ then create a link to it. Here is an example with a folder yo called .hidden with a .exe file called file.exe and an INSTALL.bat file. 

First, there is a difference between themes and actually changing the look of the entire UI. Themes are purely for changing the look of the Aero MSStyle, which doesn't give you the ability to make any major changes. MSStyles are complete UI elements that are capable of changing almost every UI element of the computer. (E.G. Aero and Luna.) However, there are no other "offical" MSStyles. Microsoft only supplies Aero, any others require patching the computer. You could just switch your Aero color to black and then it will appear darker. You also could switch to basic mode, and then manually change your windows theme. Now, window blinds is a good solution, however be sure to pay for the full version first. Removing the trial version without upgrading is very difficult and caused some problems on my laptop. (Safemode, Administrator rights, all that jazz) They are a sneaky company. I'm not saying that their products are bad, just know that there is a possibility that it could cause some performance issues and removing the program is not any piece of chocolate cake. 

One idea for OS X is to hold control and then scroll with your mouse. This will zoom in and out on part of your screen. You can zoom out by scrolling the opposite way. 

Well, my young cousin really likes minecraft. He comes over and spends time with me every now and then. When he does, we usually play minecraft, as it is one of the few games I actually like. Anyway, he wanted his friend to play on the world we created. I don't want him on the global multiplayer server, but a custom one I am fine with. I set up the minecraft server, and it should work, expect for one little thing. The firewall. I have a few computers in my network, I have an AT&T 2Wire box. The computer I am running the server on is my Mac. Now, I could just disable the firewall for the few hours we play, but I really would prefer to not do that. Instead, is it possible for me to take the IP Address of his friend's computer, and allow that address to bypass my firewall? If you have another idea, feel free to share it. 

cjb110's answer is pretty good, just adding on here. Genius and iTunes Match uses data, along with any iCloud services. If you are purchasing new apps/music/podcasts/movies on your other devices, iTunes will automatically download them to itself. This could be cause. And yes, iTunes does not copy files to it's own directory, therefore if you have the music files on another computer and are are accessing them from your MacBook, then iTunes has to constantly stream the information over. Check those things and if you still have a problem, let me know. 

You might be able to get VLC to work. See $URL$ Apparently, Jolicloud for Chrome might work. Not sure though. Here's the app. $URL$ Unfortunately, VLC requires a lot of work to get going. Good luck! 

Why am I getting this error. I am trying to set up ActionBarSherlock, but I can not get past the first command. I need ABS for building K-9 Mail. The instructions are here: $URL$ 

Component is not physically capable of 1080p. Therefore, there is no way your can activate that resolution on any device. Your going to need some new hardware. Now apparently, there is a way to achieve 1080i resolution. But I am not sure how to do that. If anyone knows how feel free to drop in another answer. However, since you said in chat that Linux does support it, I am almost positive it is a driver issue. You should try to find information from whatever company you bought the TV from and see if they will supply drivers. If not, make sure all drivers are updated. 

After updating to OS X 10.10 (Though this might have been irrelevant), I was not able to run any commands. Any command gave me this error: 

Alright, so I have a file full of thousands of strings. Each one on it's own line. I want to make a script that will allow me to take this file, call it , and take the items from each line, and place it into separate files based on the first letter or number. As an example, say the first few lines of the file are like this: 

I'm trying to install Chromium OS on my netbook via USB. I have the USB, went into Disk Utility, clicked erase. And it erased all data. Format is Fat 32. However, when I run the Chromium OS Image Creator, and try using the USB, it throws this error: "Sorry, an error occurred (failed to open the USB stick, Permission denied). Would you like to try again?" What can I do to fix this? OS X 10.8.2 Mountain Lion. 

Well, I am sure there will be a lot of answers, but here is what I will tell you. A. Eventually your computer will slow down. That is just how computers are. Even without ever getting a virus, hardware starts to falter. Especially if you have a standard Hard Drive. Moving parts are prone to breaking and slowing down. B. As for security. There is only so much one can do. Keep Microsoft security essentials, spybot. I personally use AVG, which works well. But apparently AVG does not work well with MSE. AVG does a good job from my experience. If you really want to be secure, run a scan every day. Perhaps at night when you are not using it. C. Don't download things from random places. I know it can be hard, but try to download things from actual companies, or from a secure download spot like softpedia or download.com. Downloading things from random places will make this so much harder. D. Another thing that eventually slows down a computer is registry errors. When you force down a computer, you are leaving things in a state that they shouldn't be at. Almost everyone has to force a computer down at some point. Therefore, you should get a registry cleaner program and use it after a while as well. Good luck. 

That may need some tweaking, but you get the idea. (I'm a Mac user and have no way of verifying that that exact command works. Also, windows vista+ file system is slightly different, but you should be able to figure it out.) Anyway, a hidden folder in a system folder should be pretty hard to find. Tell me if you need more information or if what I put doesn't work. Hope that helped. 

I would like to accomplish this with BASH, on OS X. Thanks. Oh, if it helps. Items on each line will NEVER have a space, they will always be contained as one word. E.G. (Never Chicken Soup, instead Chicken-Soup) 

I would greatly suggest you file a bug report on Google Chrome. Also, download another secure browser such as Firefox, and see if it complains. If it doesn't, then it is possible that Chrome as a security flaw. But be sure to file a bug. This could be pretty bad, although at the moment it might not be.
