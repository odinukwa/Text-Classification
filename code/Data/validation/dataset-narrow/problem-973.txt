Notice that when i downloaded the images, i am only interested in placing them in the secondary directory ("vegetable" and "pets") and didn't include the first directory anymore... Is there any software that let me do this? I have a MACOSX and Also have a Windows 7, So any would do for me. Thank You. 

I'm really curious of those software that promise you to make your RAM bigger and faster. But before I try it, I have to get your thoughts on it, Does the software really make your RAM run faster or boost your RAM? I just know that when you buy a physical RAM (eg. 2GB) and thats it. now if you wan't to make your computer run faster you would have to add/upgrade some of the hardware. Please share your Ideas. Thanks! 

Do you know any software or compilations that you recommend to handle drivers and codecs for newly formated computer? I am having problem gathering drivers and codecs when I format my computer or other's computer because we frequently misplace it's original drivers. I need an offline solution that doesn't need internet. Same for as the codec, when formating computer we frequently lost our codecs, are there codec packs you know that you would like to recommend? P.s. I had tried driver bot but it's only good when your online, I'm looking for a complete package that has all the driver to most common hardware (eg. Monitor, Sound, etc). Thanks! 

No, this does not improve privacy. While, depending on the VM-software you use (and the settings therein), the VM might use a different IP- and MAC-address, which might make the connection slichtly anonymous (But do not rely on it!), this does not in improve privacy. As Hennes stated in his answer as well, contents of any non-encryped connection can be read (and possibly changed) by all intermediate persons, e.g. employers as well as Internet Service Providers. Using a SSL-secured connection (for websites, also known as HTTPS) prevents intermediate persons from seeing what you send (and receive), although it still does not prevent them from knowing where you connect to (as DNS-lookups, which map a name like to an IP-address like are usually not encrypted). Better ways of ensuring privacy on the internet are: 

I am on Linux Mint 18.1 (which is based on Ubuntu 16) and usually browsing the internet through a VPN. However, recently I wanted to set up a simple server on my own computer that runs at a custom port. Now it turns out that (obviously...) using the VPN makes it impossible for people to connect to this port. So what I'd like to do, is to add an exception, that allows (only) this port to not use a VPN. Is this possible? 

As it says, since it does not support PAE, it is ultimately unable to remap PCI and every other MMIO above 4 GiB, therefore some of the memory will be shadowed and unused. Which means that even if it is used with a CPU supporting 36-bit addressing, memory above 4 GiB will still be unavailable and some of the memory close to 4 GiB limit will also be unused. Conversely, lets consider Intel® 82955X Memory Controller, which is related to the previous one, but it is specified to support 8 GB contrary to the previous one! Datasheet paragraph suggests, that it does use 36-bit address bus to the CPU, which is a good sign. Paragraph has further insights. Compare to the one we saw before: 

It does a good job illustrating the issue with memory shadowing by PCI devices etc. Also it suggests a way of overcoming this issue by mapping a range from real RAM to upper address range within CPU-addressable range. Thus reclaiming that hidden memory for use. Note that this remapping is done by BIOS/(U)EFI upon hardware initialization and it is exactly for this reason I did include BIOS/(U)EFI in bullet-list above. I have taken Intel products as an examples, but the same is true for AMD. Now lets discuss how Operating Systems are involved. The Linux kernel includes full PAE mode support starting with version 2.3.23 and it is perfectly possible to have more than 4 GiB of memory usable with Linux kernel on a 32-bit system. However be aware of an undetermined issue with 32-bit Linux kernel on a system with more than 4 GiB of RAM on some hardware (in my experience it has something to do with TLB shootdowns). Anyway Wikipedia has a good information on PAE support. Interesting is how Windows XP is limited to 4 GB, whereas Windows Server 2003 Enterprise/Datacenter SP2 is capable of full 64 GB. Same is for other Desktop-Server Windows pairs. As you can see there are many combinations among components listed and in some cases replacing a CPU or OS might help. It is much harder to deal with BIOS/(U)EFI or MCU since the former is proprietary and built-in into the system and not easily modifiable, the latter is built into the CPU or soldered on board. 

I have a software that accesses a website, I want to monitor what website is it accessing and block that website. Is there a software similar to "windows task manager" that allows you to monitor software that accesses a website? I want to know what website/server is it accessing so I could then block it. And Is there an alternative way to block aside from "host" file? Thanks! FYI: running on Win7 

[my process] in [Set1] I enter "bridge.hisdomain.com" in the hostname of PuTTy. after I hit Open It will open a terminal and will asked for a username. thats where I provide my [Set1] username and password. Ounce login, I then perform [Set2] Details. I will use "ssh username@123.456.789.123" after I enter it, It will then asked for my password. from there, when I do "DIR" in command prompt I will see al my files there. I wanted to download a directory there to my local drive but I am not familiar with the commands. I would like to access it just by using FileZilla or similar. And I've also tried this but I don't know what I'd miss, because It didn't work for me. I downloaded a .pem file from the [set1] because I can also access it using a regular FTP (filezilla) and I then converted that .pem file to .ppk. right now I'm kinda confuse what login info I should use for my FileZilla to access the server. I had success in loging via FTP using [Set1] login details. But my files aren't there. I only saw some folders and a .pem file. I can't login to my Filezilla using [set2] details. I tried FTP and SFTP. I also added the .ppk file in the settings of my fileZilla. But I had no success in loging in. any ideas what did I miss? 

While specifying new rule's application path, Windows Firewall tries to substitute parts of the path with environmental variables like , etc. That's nice, but eventually it may come up with , which might be confusing for a system service, not running with any particular user credentials, but system. Try and find yourself that very application starting with system folder or drive root or whatever! That's the case for Windows Firewall which could not find any application to apply rule to and as such no rule applied after all. Try to avoid using environmental variables by specifying path directly. 

The last item does not relate to the issue directly, but I've added it for a completeness sake. In a nutshell, all of the above components have to support more than 4 GB of memory in order to succeed. Central Processing Unit Lets start with a CPU. But first it is important to note, that a CPU does not have any magical ability to use any memory at all. Instead it could just access any address within its addressable space. Now here comes the bitness-thing. 32-bit CPU is capable of accessing addresses in range from 0 to 4 GiB. This range however has to accommodate not only the available RAM, ROM, SMRAM, Graphics Address Remapping Table but also all the required Memory-mapped I/O and many more, which might require substantial part of this address range. As a consequence it might be perfectly possible, that some memory addresses were shadowed by those uses and therefore are not available for operations on RAM. In order to regain hidden memory it is necessary to extend the CPU accessible address space. In case of 32-bit CPU Physical Address Extension could help. Which allows addressing up to 64 GiB. 64-bit CPU operating in native 64-bit mode is by default capable of accessing up to 16 EiB, which is rather huge and does not require such tricks. But on the other hand it is impractical for a 64-bit CPU to use 64-bit addressing, so in reality they are still limited by their address bus to a lesser range than 16 EiB. Memory Controller Unit Initially it was located in Northbridge, but was moved onto the processor die by AMD beginning with their AMD64 processors and by Intel with their Nehalem processors. Even if a CPU with PAE is capable of accessing 64 GiB by itself, it still needs a MCU to access RAM. Simply put: a CPU accessing particular address gets its reply either from PCI device, BIOS ROM flash or MCU, if the address requested resides in RAM, and so on. It is not uncommon however for a MCU (be it in Northbridge or in CPU) to support much less addressable space than 64 GiB for marketing reasons for example. BIOS / (U)EFI BIOS / (U)EFI are also important as it is their duty to configure the hardware before anything can actually operate. Among other things they are responsible for mapping the entire processor addressable space with memory ranges of hardware devices, buses, RAM and so on. Interestingly it might happen that the whole RAM split in pieces and mapped at several available non-contiguous spots. The problem with BIOS is that it's developers might not expect more than 3 GiB of RAM usage within their system and as such BIOS will not properly map all of the memory to be used. Most likely this will not happen to (U)EFI. Operating system Operating system should also support addressing more than 4 GiB memory. To be more specific, it should configure a CPU to use PAE. Some 32-bit OSes are perfectly capable of using PAE and accessing more than 4 GiB, others have software-limit on maximum memory, even though they enable PAE for enhanced security (Windows XP being an example). Once again 64-bit OSes naturally do not have such difficulties and normally support more than 4 GiB of memory. Application The last point is from a different world, since applications commonly operate in a Virtual Address Space, I have added it for a completeness sake. Nonetheless it takes some additional steps while compiling for application to be able to use more memory. By default 32-bit application only capable of using 2 GiB of memory. The same 32-bit application could address up to 4 GiB of memory, provided that OS does support that and has enabled CPU PAE. More specifically, it could use up to 3 GiB of memory, the other 1 GiB would be addressable as common libraries and OS kernel, but not writeable (ultimately this depends on OS architecture rather than application itself). Again, 64-bit applications natively support addressing more than 4 GiB of memory and do not have such troubles at the first place. To put all of this into perspective, lets consider several examples. Consider Intel® 82945G Memory Controller. Intel website states, that it does not support PAE and is limited to 4 GB of RAM. Lets consult paragraph of the datasheet. It has lots of information. Most interesting is : 

I'll be re-install my Operating system in my desktop, It would be a clean version of windows7. I wonder if there's a software that lets me install my application automatically or an easier way to install all my old application. I still have all my installer sitting in my hard drive. I just need a software to automate it, but not to hard to configure it. What would be the process that you would recommend if you're in my shoes. I'm still using my old windows 7 here in my desktop. But before I format my old drives, I would want to get your suggestions and opinions. I also stumbled on a cool software "Windows Post-Install Wizard" But the problem of this is I'm having hard time to configure it. Thanks! 

I'm not good doing network on my computer. I've been searching on the web and youtube for tutorials on how to properly connect/share files from desktop to laptop using wireless connection. Here's the scenario: I bought a D-Link router and plugged my internet source and then from my router it connects to my Destop (Lan 1) using RJ-45 and a cable. The internet is currently working well for my Desktop and Laptop. In my laptop I can access the internet using wireless connection and my desktop it uses a cable from the router. The Problem: I've been trying to setup a homegroup (both in Laptop and Desktop) but I can't find any of them to connect. I also can't find any of them in my network. I'm guessing that my Laptop and Desktop are not properly configured to connect to each other. It just connect to the internet... What I'm trying to achieve: I need to share files from my Desktop to Laptop or vise versa. I don't know how to do this, any tutorials online would be good. I also don't want to use DropBox or similar services... My System: My Desktop and Laptop is using Windows 7 Ultimate. Please advice. Thanks! 

I expect this has to do with file/directory rights management in linux/unix. My home directory is obviously owned by myusername, while nginx is run by the user www-data. However, I am not sure how to alter the rights of this folder so that www-data/nginx is able to access it (and the files within). How can this be resolved? And why did I not run into this problem while configuring Apache on my previous computer (also running Linux Mint)? 

Copy images to new location. Rename current directory, and give a symlink to the new location its old name. Remove the old directory. 

However, the actual copying step takes forever using . I've also tried but this also takes so long (it ran for multiple hours before hanging) that the shell session breaks beforehand. Is there another, smarter way to copy/move this large amount of files to its new location on another hard disk? The VPS is running Ubuntu 16. 

Note that even through you use systems like the above-stated, these protect your transport. What they do not protect against is how you interact with the sites. 

Is there an an efficient way of copying selected files to a new folder? I have a list of files I want to copy (including the path), I'm just not sure what command I can run to achieve my goal. I need to make a copy of some of the files, and preserve it's original directory structure. The selected files have varying location, some resides in the root folder while some are nested in sub folders. Source: 

My Hard Disk Drive just got corrupted due to electricity fluctuation. When I plug my Western Digital Elements, It ask me if I want to format it or not... I can't see my files or even the capacity of my disk from it's properties. Is there any solution you would suggest? looking for a software that can give me access to my files. I just need to copy it then I can retire my Drive and will buy a new one... Thanks! 

What are the option in creating a quick access to dialing a contact in Skype? and How? Example I want to bind a custom key in calling my friend, let say 

After creating a rule targeting specific application, nothing changed as if my new rule was just ignored. That is if my rule says to allow, but default is to block, application is still blocked. Should I disable Windows Firewall completely, the application in question could establish connection. 

Sadly, mentioned tools would likely not support 64-bit applications. However it is possible to write a custom interceptor using mhook library supporting both 32-bit and 64-bit API. 

It is a rather complicated question as it takes several components to work out. Those components are: 

It is possible to capture all network traffic for a given application by intercepting Windows Sockets API calls. These are the tools that may help. 

This clearly suggests that it is capable of utilizing more than 4 GiB of RAM, provided that it is used with the CPU also capable of 36-bit addressing. It is also worth noting that paragraph states that . However it is further clarified, that maximum usable RAM is limited to 8 GB. This once again declares the difference between addressable and usable as I was trying to convey in the CPU section. To conclude this, I'd like to note that two related chipsets have in fact huge difference in memory handling. Lets inspect Intel® Pentium® Processor Extreme Edition 840. It does support 64-bit instruction set, but does not support PAE. Which means that if run in 32-bit mode, it will be unable to use more than 4 GiB of RAM (please, correct me if I'm wrong with this assumption). Lets check the datasheet and table . Even though that this CPU is 64-bit capable, it is still limited by it's address bus being 36-bit wide, thus limiting it to accessible address range starting from 0 to 64 GiB. Now lets examine a more recent CPU. Take Intel® Core™ i7-7700 Processor for example. It is advertised to support up to 64 GB of RAM. Now lets check the datasheet of it. Paragraph convinces us that this CPU's addressable range is from 0 up to 512 GiB due to 39-bit address bus. Note that it is still far from the theoretical 16 EiB range for a 64-bit CPU. Surprisingly though it further clarifies that this CPU does support up to 32 GiB of usable RAM maximum (contrary to 64 GB on the website). There is also an image of interest here : 

(I also added a symbolic link from sites-enabled to this: ). After restarting nginx (), and adding to my -file, I was greeted with a 404 error. Looking in , I find out that the requests I do fail because of the following reason: 

I recently moved to a new computer, and copied over all existing git repositories for webdevelopment projects from my old computer. On that old computer, I had installed apache to serve certain folders from as subdirectory of my home folder as development websites (either static or using PHP). So, for instance, a personal project would live under . Now on the new computer, I tried setting up nginx, to use it in a similar way. I followed this guide on DigitalOcean to install nginx (and MySQL and PHP) on my laptop that runs Linux Mint 18.1 (Serena). I configured nginx as follows: : 

According to the Unicode standard, (the underscore character) is part of a word. This means that when you skip your cursor to the next word (in many interfaces you can do this with Ctrl + the arrow keys) you will skip over all the characters as well as the letters and numbers in-between. However, vim (where moving to the next/previous word is done using or in normal mode) regards not as one word, but as five: . I would like to configure Vim's behaviour such that is also properly considered a word character. How can this be done?
