The limit is 127. That’s not a Mac limit, it’s the USB spec. If you’re having problems with fewer than 127 devices (internal devices and buses count against the limit), it’s more likely to be a power problem. 

You can create private repositories in Bitbucket, but a private repository is one that only your users can log into, not one that's publicly accessible without a login but behind a URL that's not published, which seems to be what you want. So I don't think you can do what you want with Bitbucket. 

Try the following. It uses the fact that you can extract the daytime measurements to subtract the daytime element from the total, giving the overnight average. 

In theory, there is, based on finding the network latency between the IP address and a large number of routers with known locations. See this paper. I'm not aware of any commercial implementations, and it would be a lot of work to implement for yourself. 

Zip doesn't just store the contents of the file, it also stores file metadata like the owning user id, permissions, creation and modification times and so on. If you have one file you have one set of metadata; if you have 10,000 files you have 10,000 sets of metadata. 

You're always likely to struggle if you try to run 2012 software on 2007 hardware and a 2001 operating system. It may be time for an upgrade. If that's not feasible, then I'd look for an old browser version, although watch out for unpatched security vulnerabilities. 

Some MS programs will flat-out tell you that they were made for Spanish only, like IE and won't even install. Regardless, I had a USA English PC with Spanish Office XP (meaning version 2002). My regional settings are for English / USA, in case you were wondering --I know what multilingual programs on Windows act like. Office 2002 only came with the Spanish strings and has no English workarounds at all. Unless MS is more generous now in spite of the bad economy, assume nothing improved for Office 2011, especially if both sell in your local country. For more evidence that you won't often get multilingual-bundled installers from Microsoft, you can confirm MS downloads like Internet Explorer are split by language. Functionality is the same --the only difference I did notice is that Spanish 2002 has English/USA spelling dictionaries built-in while English 2002 didn't have all of the Spanish dictionaries (Spanish grammar and thesaurus were missing I think.) 

See if you can print a different file from the same program, a webpage, and a textedit page. Don't worry about spooling sizes. Even a single page in notepad under Windows itself can "register" as 1.5+ MB when spooled out to the printer. Your problem is likely: An incorrect choice for the Macintosh's printer driver. A particular post-processing setting on the Printer Preferences is throwing off the HP at the other end of the wire. If the files are in PDF format, mismatched PDF output levels could be wrong (like Adobe software using PDF level 3 instead of 1 or 2.) Save yourself sanity and troubleshooting time: just connect your printer and Mac once via USB and test printing again before you start making settings changes. 

There can be (and often are) multiple different IP addresses associated with a single domain name. For example, google.com currently resolves (for me) to: 

It depends on the exact capabilities of your router. If it lets you define multiple IP subnets, bind different ports to different subnets and route between subnets then it should all work as you've diagrammed it, but lots of consumer-grade ADSL routers lack this level of flexibility. You'll need to set the router's 192.168.1.x address as the default gateway for the 192.169.0.x subnet to give Internet access to that subnet. Be aware that 192.169.0.x is not in the IP ranges reserved for private networks by RFC1918, and you could get conflicts with public IP addresses in this range. You'd do better to use something under 172.16-31.x.x or 10.x.x.x for your second subnet. 

Files won't be deleted, but they'll be overwritten with modified versions. I wouldn't regard this as safe myself -- if you mess up a file and don't notice for a day, then you've lost the good version. 

Stick to movies that are now in the public domain, and thus can legally be copied however you please. Or lobby your representatives to get the law changed to permit people who have legally acquired a copy of a movie to copy it for their own use without Hollywood's approval. 

It's going to be a 4GB and a 2GB, not 2 x 3GB. You can generally (but not always) mix and match different size DIMMs or SODIMMs. 

I'm having trouble editing HTML in an older version of VI(M). . When reading .sh shell scripts there is no problem, though. It doesn't recognize html files for syntax highlighting. Is there any to force a particular language interpretation even if the editor doesn't recognize it? In emacs, informs the editor what language you're actually editing. I can't upgrade because this is running in servers. 

The first column of the output with the four digit numbers (in this particular output) is the process ID for the process name at the far right of the table. BTW, press 'q' to exit top or it will keep polling and updating endlessly every few seconds. top only shows a screenful's worth of lines with the hungriest processes rather than the dozens of total processes. You can use slhck's pattern to find other processes. Even my own example had about 200 processes running. You probably are looking for your process ID as an intermediate step to something else. If you need to kill a process, because it's out of control, you can research kill and killall. you can type man kill and it will give you useful info. To exit that manpage and most other interactive CLI programs such as top, press 'q'. 

The user-friendly way will be running free anti-spyware software, though it requires installation and a multi-hour scan that may or may not find your problem. Manually, you might want to see if your homepage was redirected under . If you have anything newer than IE6, then you can probably delete it via . On the left, look inside and also in , and from the lists on the right, select the offending iMesh parts and click on Remove. Welcome, and good luck. You can comment under here if you need more assistance. 

Sounds like a flaky DNS server. Your existing connections don't need DNS, so they're maintained, but you can't do DNS lookups to create new connections by hostname. To check this, look up an IP address for Google or something while everything is working OK (e.g. 209.85.143.99), and then when it goes flaky, try loading the Google home page by IP address ($URL$ If it loads OK, then it's a DNS problem. 

As well as @teppic's answer, you could set up a hot corner in Screen Saver preferences to activate the screen saver if you move the mouse pointer to a corner (I use the bottom left corner), and then just swipe to that corner when you're leaving your computer unattended. 

Your Mac is new enough that it should be able to install the OS from the Internet, with no recovery partition needed on the hard disk. So you should be able to proceed with the recovery without choosing a disk to boot from. 

With RSA, it is the case that messages encrypted with the private key can be decrypted with the public key, as well as vice versa. But that's not the case with all public key encryption, and is not required for digital signatures. What's required is that there is some pair of algorithms one of which can produce a signature using a private key and the other one of which can verify the signature using the matching public key. The exact implementation details of those algorithms are different for different protocols. 

I'm running UNETBOOTIN on my USB stick. Ubuntu 10.04.02 is running OK, but I have two usability questions: 1) Is there a way to enlarge the persistent storage now that I've found need for more than 100MB originally allocated? 2) How do I mount the actual "Windows" side of the stick? I can't seem to find something specific in mount: 

I normally keep running PPPoE on the modem to ensure a tiny bit lesser load on my router and let the modem do the job it was specifically optimized to do best. However, I sometimes switch it to the modem for two reasons:

In System Preferences, ensure your country is set to United Kingdom in "Language & Region". Then close Excel if it's running, run it, and try again. 

I'm just guessing here, but if Apple Hardware Test is giving an error, I'd say you have a hardware fault and need to get it repaired. 

Imagine auditing a data centre with 200 racks filled with 4,000 devices, many of which are years old. Imagine trying to determine what they all are, what software stack they're running, what they do, whether upgrades are available, whether the upgrades cost money, and whether their IPV6 support is buggy (which a lot of it is, because it's fairly new and hasn't had extensive use in a live environment). Now imagine testing all that to convince your board of directors that it's safe to push the switch and enable IPV6 in your network. The specific issue mentioned in the article to which you link is that a small percentage of Internet users (maybe 0.05%) are on networks that have IPV6 connectivity enabled but non-funtional (for various reasons), so that if a website offers an IPV6 option, they will try to use IPV6 to access it, and fail (or suffer very poor performance). 0.05% may not sound very much, but it's over a million people. 

All automated PDF to ePub tools do a bad job, as they have a hard time stripping out page headers and footers and joining up paragraphs that span more than one page. 

Gnome's Places menu only lists SYSTEM (mostly the r/w Casper filesystem portion of the LiveUSB stick) and OS (my local Windows hard drive). Both are visible as fuseblock /sda devices, so there's nothing to un-hide. 

The disconnect logs (for troubleshooting) on the modem tend to be nonexistent on some modems, hidden behind needless clicks, and/or require a login password that you're guaranteed to forget lots more than your router's. Many DLINK routers have a globe-shaped "internet" LED that goes orange when PPPoE is down. 

Yes, the radio schedule controls the availability of your wireless connection and is meant for those in primarily wired area who don't care much about who gets cut off. To answer your first question, the radio will kick you off without warnings, according to the changes you have set up. For your second question, I couldn't find the exact setting page from your Wifi snapshot under my own version () and advanced Wireless only describes channel and encryption settings, rather than a schedule. I would guess that it doesn't matter that you found a settings page enable your wireless manually, because another will still "remember" your schedule and power things off at the appointed time. It is up to your router to handle that. 

Avoiding a full Cygwin-like install, is there some equivalent to the Japanese-English translation/reference tool gWaei from Ubuntu/Gnome, but for Windows? If not, what open source translators allow us to review and look up both English and Kanji characters? Update: My Gozoku test-drive was not good, because I discovered it doesn't take romaji input like gWaei seemlessly does (ie: you can't type the english characters for "arigato" and get a japanese dict lookup in Gozoku because it is a pure dictionary). Also, Gozoku answers a search with a result tree that isn't pastable without some expansion of branches, right-clicking and choosing "save to clipboard." gWaei allows you to easily get a flat list of results where you don't HAVE to copy whole words. When you lack a Japanese keyboard layout or the knowlege to use one, cutting bits and pieces of different japanese results as if they were newspaper collages is great for putting together a google-able search is nice. I'll check out the sourceforge build of gWaei and see if I needn't look elsewhere. 

Some routers have MAC address spoofing built in, where they will use the MAC address of your PC on the Internet-connected network port rather than their own MAC address. See, for example, this Netgear help page. 

I would purchase and use Emailchemy Forensic Edition to convert the OSTs into some format that can be grepped (I'd recommend Maildir), then write a shell script or Perl script or whatever works best for you in order to extract the relevant ones. Make sure you have plenty of disk space. 

OK, it looks like either /var/lib/mysql doesn't exist or the mysql user doesn't have permission to access it. Either way, you have worse problems than having forgotten the root password -- either you don't have a database at all, or something has changed the file permissions or ownership. 

Just configure it the same as you would if you had a static IP address. None of those parameters will change when your external IP address changes, so the dynamic IP won't make any difference. 

There are the CrossOver products from CodeWeavers, which are basically more polished commercial versions of Wine. Or you can run a VM like VirtualBox and buy a licensed copy of Windows to run in it. 

That generally means that you've got a cheap knock-off memory card, possibly a counterfeit of a reputable brand. There's probably no hope for it, but you might try asking for a refund. 

If the owner of a Mac hasn't enabled the root account (via NetInfo manager and the usual suspects) then is it possible to successfully execute a sudo'd command to effect root tasks? Why / Why not? I don't have an unadulterated Mac to test this. 

Considering that MacOS systems have relatively few exploits and are only very recently known to have trojan horse software, it is unlikely that someone made purchases from your computer leaving a trail back to you. The timing of your question and this random web post from a couple days ago quoting the same e-mail address in a different site could mean you're the same affected fellow. The 1 single reply the person got is that there indeed is software on your computer that the new MacOS has found to "belong" to that particular ID. From a screenshot in another website, your error message looks a little different for what other users see, because theirs aren't mentioning a specific e-mail address. Having unwanted things in one's computer is common these days of mega-downloading. I would search for both "Angry Birds" and "asdfff2011@mail.ru" using your magnifying glass tool on the top right (Spotlight) and see if something does come up. You of course can't know the password to review past App store purchases for that other mail.ru (Russian) person, but it is likely that they somehow hacked it to avoid paying, and registered under this seemingly fake address, and somehow you got that one "altered" copy of the software. I'd just ignore it.
