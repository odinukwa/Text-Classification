Frames are passed over Ethernet. A single broadcast frame is all that is required to tell switch 2 to propagate the broadcast to all of its 48 access ports, not 48 individual frames. Is that what you were looking for? 

Configure VLAN "cameras" on the switch along with a unique subnet for them to use, say, 10.2.2.x/24. On the router, if you have a spare ethernet port, assign it ip address 10.2.2.254/24. If no spare ethernet interface, reconfigure link to switch as a trunk so it gets frames from both VLAN's (default and cameras). In any case, simply create an access list so that the only device that the cameras VLAN/subnet can access is the IP address of the NAS. purchase a decent switch (one that supports VLANs and PoE+ for your cameras). 

A frame is a layer 2 datagram. A packet is a layer 3 datagram. A payload is the data being transported by a layer2 and/or layer3 datagram minus any layer2 or layer3 overhead such as bits being used to encapsulate the payload. An analogy might be a train where the whole train is a packet, made up of the engine and caboose (hehe I just said caboose). then there might be one or more train cars being frames. The payload is the stuff being transported by the train. search for osi network layer model for more detail. 

it is not called an Ethernet cable * it is not a connection, it's a transmission humans will not perceive delay introduced by cable length alone 

If you are connecting to Azure via a public network (Internet) then add a public facing port on your ASA for the VPN tunnel to Azure. You could do some static NAT shenanigans to the ASA but it's poor engineering as it violates the KISS principle. 

...when the scalpel fails, pick up the axe and hack! CORS Bypass plugins; Yes...! Good lord, that was a multiday journey through the innerds of XHR and Fetch. 

It is good practice to use /24 subnets because doing so conforms with the KISS Principle, namely the first host address in the subnet gets and the last host gets . The broadcast address is . If you have a /27 for example, you might end up with available hosts being - and a broadcast address of . See the difference. Network Design should adhere to the KISS principle. That being said, there are cases where IP address availability is restricted and VLSM is necessary but in 99% of private networks VLSM is not necessary and would be over-engineering. 

Think of it as a router with an Ethernet switch linecard attached. If you aren't very familiar with configuring Cisco equipment, have a look at AutoSecure. 

You will see dynamic (automatic/automated) routing protocols like OSPF used in multi-site networks. with OSPF, if you add a subnet (new VLAN) at remote site-x, the routing tables of the other routers in the network can get updated automatically. Without OSPF, you might have to add that new route in every other site's router. EIGRP is widely deployed in all-Cisco networks but a big advantage of OSPF is that it is standards based. So customer can integrate other vendors routers in the future. 

Note, if you are connecting to the switch from the endpoint you are unplugging you will not get the syslog message because you will have cut connectivity. 

Virtual chassis' are an improvement over chassis based switches primarily because of MLAG support. Redundancy improvement is true only insofar as passive metal is a point of failure. This is a matter of probability and is quote low. Scalability is not significantly improved. In fact, 48-port linecards are often cheaper than 48 port switches. So, as you get very large chassis, the cost per port actually decreases. Management is improved only insofar as a campus or org-wide virtual chassis is deployed. 

It's your filter that's wrong. Syntax for mac addresses varies. Sometimes its ff:ff:ff: ... and sometimes it's ffff.ffff ..., etc. Double check your syntax. 

In large-scale or "warehouse-scale" data centers, IETF concensus "proposes the use of an EBGP-only design" with a unique ASN for every top of rack (ToR) Ethernet switch rather than using either TRILL (their own layer 2 standard) or M-LAG (VPN, VPS, VCS, etc). Granted a Layer 3 MPLS is not identical to Ethernet, given the millisecond triggered eBGP reconvergence for link down events, I see added value in a standardized approach. Therefore eBGP, or BGP w Private ASN's, is the best design (because the IETF informs us so). 

Default gateway missing on PC's. Your hosts/endpoints need to have a default gateway in addition to an IP address. Without the default gateway, the endpoint don't know how/where to send the packet for the other subnet. The default gateway is going to be on the same subnet as the PC's NIC card. 

The load balancing can be done via subnet or vlan or any criteria that you can think of with an ACL, provided your switch is a layer 3 switch. Simply match the traffic and apply a route map to policy route said traffic thru 2901 corresponding to ISP1, and ISP2 respectively. If switch is layer 2 only, move the firewall to the other side of the 2901's and have the 2901 be the default gateway per VLAN/subnet. You can then load balance ISP per VLAN. 

The public IP is nailed to your AT&T router which will be down when it's down. BGP would be required to tell the Internet that your public IP is now accessible via another link. I don't know of your VoIP config/topology so I can't say much more without more info. You might be better served configuring a redundant VPN as a foundation. From there, your internal IP traffic (including VoIP packets) would have redundant paths. However, if your VoIP system needs to be reachable via the Internet, there are other steps you might be able to take depending on the VoIP protocol, such as having secondary/failover addresses for whatever VoIP service it is. 

It's a standard. The IEEE 802® LAN/MAN Standards Committee develops LAN and metropolitan area network (MAN) standards. 

Be sure and test each scenario at each site and pay attention to failover and failback times. This is a great routing job. Hub and spoke, or ring? You can do it. 

SNMP server settings are configured on the client(s). So, if you are using SNMP your server gets messages that way. If you are not using SNMP, you might try pushing out DHCP option with manager ip address. Client would need to be configured somehow to get this value though. 

"The answer is through the use of phantom power—power sent over the same wire pairs used for data. When the same pair is used for both power and data, the power and data transmissions don’t interfere with each other. Because electricity and data function at opposite ends of the frequency spectrum, they can travel over the same cable. Electricity has a low frequency of 60 Hz or less, and data transmissions have frequencies that can range from 10 million to 100 million Hz" source 

Traffic shaping is how you would do the limiting. This will require classifying traffic to be shaped (limited). I did find a doc, TCP and UDP ports used by Apple software products, but NBAR may be a better way to match/classify the iCloud photo sharing. Like you said, if you can determine a particular destination domain then NBAR can match that way. 

Yes. One such network is called the Internet. Practically speaking there is no limit to the number of nodes, especially when accounting for IPv6. 

Packets are layer 3 items. Frames are layer 2 items. Routers route packets and bridges/switches pass frames. Internet Protocol (IP) = layer 3. If your endpoints have no ip addresses, they are no accessible by endpoints beyond their layer 2 domain. So, a VLAN is a virtual LAN, or a segregated out bridge/switch - virtually. That could be considered a security feature. 

The NAT'ing device keeps a table of mappings. As packets are returned to the original sender (the routable IP address that sent them) the NAT device does a lookup in that table to re-address the destination packet with the inside private IP. 

Yes. You certainly can calculate how many at least if you know your maximum transmission unit, MTU. You are speaking of frames which is layer2. So, simply do the math. Assuming approximately 1500 bytes for Ethernet. 80,480 KB (Filesize) / 1.5 KB (MTU) = 53653.33 frames. 

See Creation and Management of Catalyst 3750 Switch Stacks Software Compatibility Switches with the same major version number but with a different minor version number as the stack master are considered partially compatible. When connected to a switch stack, a partially compatible switch enters version-mismatch (VM) mode and cannot join the stack as a fully functional member. The software detects the mismatched software and tries to upgrade (or downgrade) the switch in VM mode with the switch stack image or with a tar file image from the switch stack flash memory. The software uses the automatic upgrade (auto-upgrade) and the automatic advise (auto-advise) features. Note: If the auto upgrade does not work on the switch that shows the version mismatch error, use TFTP to manually upgrade the switch. 

You just buy another one and plug it in to the existing one with a Cat5/6 cable (or two for redundancy via an etherchannel). If they are far apart, get the miniGBIC for multimode fiber x2 (one for each switch, or x4 2 for each) and plug it in that way. $URL$ The Cisco 300 Series also offers mini gigabit interface converter (mini-GBIC) expansion slots that give you the option to add fiber-optic or Gigabit Ethernet uplink connectivity to the switch. 

Overlay as in a layer is not new. IP is layered on top of link layer technologies such as Ethernet. IP GRE tunneling used to be discouraged because of the overhead, sometimes doubling the bandwidth required to send the same message if the message was small. With encryption a requirement for some, encrypted tunneling like IPSec VPN's became popular. These days bandwidth is cheap and abundant so we have tons of overlay technologies deployed to fix various needs. As a result, the number of network engineers with practical knowledge of link layer networking is decreasing - they simply overlay over overlay over overlay. That's my opinion. 

The term does not appear at all in the OSI/ITU-T's Reference Model. The term is used because it describes the function of the method being utilized, namely, encapsulating, or packaging, stuff to then send on. 

I setup an unlicensed (BYOD) CSR1000v on AWS per the steps I outlined on Deploying Cisco CSR1000v on an AWS EC2 Instance. I configured the REST api per Cisco CSR 1000v Series Cloud Services Router Software Configuration Guide's Configuring Support for Management Using the REST API chapter. The REST api is up/up per the show command. is also configured. Lastly, I opened the AWS firewall up to allow everything and can both ping my CSR1000v and can view it via my Web browser. My issue is that I cannot get the REST api connection started. It just times out. Debug shows nothing. Using CURL, and pasting in the example directly from Cisco IOS XE REST API Management Reference Guide's Introducing the IOS XE REST API chapter: 

If possible, connect/link the switches in a hub and spoke fashion rather than a ring fashion. Each uplink should be configured as a trunk. Be sure the trunk type (802.1q probably) is the same on both ends. If you have multiple VLANs, which it sounds like you do, route between them on your core/hub device. STP should not really come in to play much in the hub/spoke topology. 

The new DSL router/modem has 2 interfaces - LAN and WAN. Out of the box, it is likely providing DHCP services on to the LAN (serving up IP addresses). You need to log in to the management GUI on that new DSL router and turn this off. You then need to assign a static IP address to the LAN interface - an address that is on the subnet/VLAN switchport that it plugs into. Then, the new DSL router needs to be told of the other private IP address subnets that exist on your network so that devices on other subnets can be reached by the new DSL router. This is probably as easy as adding routes to the routing table telling it that these are reachable via the primary gateways IP address. Now, how to handle the switching of the default gateway between primary and secondary (new DSL router) if primary WAN is down. That is doable in a number of standards-based ways but alot of times your gateway will have some proprietary method of doing this. It can be simple of very complex config becuase remember, sometimes a primary WAN outage is NOT accompanied by a link outage. You want to research alternate routing, failover routing in the devices documentation to get sample configs. Or, post the device make/model here. 

Access: 4x (or 5x) Cisco WS-C2960X-48TS-LL Core: 2x Cisco WS-C3850-12S-E SFPs: double the uplink count deploy aqua colored OM3-OM4 fiber between floors for future 10G 

For data center deployments, I like Layer 2 Transparent Mode Chassis Clusters as layer2 adjacency is required for vMotion, for example. You can then do your layer 3 stuff on the ASR's but allow east west (server-to-server) traffic to bypass them all together. ISSU appears to be supported so you won't bring down the data center when rolling out new software to the SRX's. Your ASR's can provide VPN and NAT. 

You should configure a full mesh VPN so that spoke to spoke traffic does not have to hairpin the main site. In other words, configure a VPN between the branch sites. 

You need a controller to run these. Simply look up the model of that chassis and read the documentation. 

The physical port speed is signified by the interface type name. In your case, means . Fast Ethernet means 100Mbps. However, a subrate Ethernet port can be achieved with the command. The hardware speed (full or subrate) is often called the port speed. The circuit speed can be configured with traffic shaping or policing. So that's 2 distinct keys terms, port speed and circuit speed. Try mediaIndependentInputSpeed or CISCO-IF-EXTENSION-MIB 

Configuration register = 0x2102 at last boot Bit# Configuration register option settings: 15 Diagnostic mode disabled 

The new microwave links will terminate via Ethernet. Plug that into your switch. Each site requires a unique private subnet(s), if that is not already configured. Create a unique point to point subnet/VLAN per microwave link (/30 bit masked network). The 2921 should trunk .1q to the switch. Now the 2921's can route. 

There's 2 distinct parameters: calling number and calling name. They are not the same. Some PSTN providers allow you to set one or both of these to whatever you want, others will not. Passing calling number should be trivial. There is a mask field in CM, as I recall. Don't mask outbound calls. Put "XXXX" in there rather than the main number. Note this setting may appear in the line configuration page and the route pattern page. ...It's been a while. Should be easy though. Just remember, your provider may not allow you to spoof / provide other numbers than your DID range. As far as passing name goes, I believe your PSTN provider sets that for you and you would need to coordinate with them if you want something other than "" to show up for particular DID's. 

The router does not broadcast that it is there as a default gateway. A DHCP server does respond to a shout out (broadcast) from the endpoint though. Part of the DHCP response is the IP address of the default gateway (the router). Most routers have built in DHCP servers which are disabled by default. Many server/I.T. admins rather use Windows Server DHCP. 

In the scenario you describe OSPF is the wrong tool and should not be used at all as is would be a waste of resources (CPU cycles/power/administration). You would configure a simple static route. However, if you insisted on using OSPF in your scenario, all it would do is collect unnecessary details of the far end system (or AS as you call it). 

You do not need a network address for the wire. The wire is going to be a particular type of data link, probably Ethernet on both ends. The long range cable is single mode fiber. It could also be wireless microwave. 

Private APN sounds like there is no VPN configuration required on your equipment - the provider does that for you. Is there an internal and separate provider facing IP address on the 3G gateway? If so, can you ping the inside facing IP address? It may be that ping to the external facing address simply will not work and you may have to access the device via the internal facing address.
