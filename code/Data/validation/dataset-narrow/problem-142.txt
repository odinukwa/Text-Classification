Soution: For testing i have download nx-os file but same issue, no luck :( But then i decided just Install instead of verification and it works! 

We have Default routes till date with our ISP and now we are planning to run BGP with ISP, reason we want RTBH triggering. Question: 

We have following network where vpn users getting DHCP IP range 10.5.255.0/24 and i have two LAN segment as you can see. 10.5.0.0/21 10.0.10.0/24 

On Trunk interface i allowed Now i can ping from .11 to .12 ip address using vlan3 (L2) network. and HSRP is happy (active/standby). But if i unplug cable on port trying to mimic cable is cut and my VIP will failover. but problem is .11 and .12 is on interface and they are no matter you cut the cable or not.. How do i solve this issue in above scenario? 

links are up but if i check in STP configuration on cisco my 10G link is in blocking mode and 2G link is forwarding mode, as per STP cost calculation 10G link should be in forwarding because it has total cost to reach root is 4 and 2G link total cost to root is 5 right? Even i tried to increase spanning-tree cost of 2G link but it didn't work still that link is in FWD mode. 

Now i go ahead and shutdown sw1 interface (ISP side interface) and then i am seeing following routing table on if you notice my default gateway is now and disappeared so now my traffic flowing like this -->-->--> 

I have following scenario, where i am getting 1G copper Cat6 cable from ISP and directly terminated on my Cisco ASA firewall on interface and i have configured now my in failover output it is monitoring status because they are coming from distinct router of ISP, how do i solve this issue without introducing any switch between ISP and my ASA? I can't ping outside interface of public IP from i am sure because of that i am seeing status waiting but is there any other work around? I do have many 1G interface free on ASA, can i create special VLAN and route traffic between or something? 

This is very odd problem so place stay with me because it's very strange issue. We have C3850 L3 core switch and we have created VLAN interface on it and we are using it for L3 routing. I have other switches connected to C3850 core switches, so issue is if i send any traffic to any other server this switch forwarding that traffic to all its interface, just like SPAN port. ( We don't have any mirror session running on this switch) Does anybody see this kind of issue in network? look like L3 flooding. Look like this is happening Unicast Flooding: $URL$ any idea what could be the issue of it? Update: After googling i found people saying reduce ARP timeout and increase MAC timeout, (Arp < Mac) Cisco default Arp timeout is 4 hour, and Mac timeout is 300s (5min). ARP timeout: 

ProCurve 6120XG Blade Switch with Cisco trunk I have c7000 HP blade Center with ProCurve 6120XG Blade Switch and i am creating trunk to my TOR1 Cisco switch (Nexus 3064), but having issue related VLAN traffic. 

It was HSRP asymmetric routing issue. We has HSRP and i found few VLANs are active on SW1 and few VLANs were active on SW2 and that was creating ARP flooding. as soon as i move all VLANs (HSRP) on single switch flood is gone. here is the cisco doc: $URL$ 

Update: In following command its showing this, Does that means i already have license and i just need to Activate it? Look at what that means? 

How should i perform failover link using BGP with same ISP? From Router to L3 switch should i create VLAN trunk (L2) and create VLANs on Router instead of L3 switch. Or Should i do between Router to L3 switch and create VLANs on L3 switch instead of Router. 

UPDATE for testing i have installed in my lab and bind with LDAP and here is the sample configuration. Freeradius config in section 

I have multiple VLAN on switch but i want to make my switch as for only and rest will be but i am confused in following two method I want to set following SW1 

We have BGP running over route for subnet, but yesterday after talking to ISP they said if you want to send traffic over to their specific ISP then you need to use BGP community, How do i set that in my BGP config to advertise specific communities over BGP and does it work for individual IP address or i have to do whole subnet for example: does single IP will work or i need to do full subnet? 

Update: Talk to cisco support and they did some debug but no answer found, we replaced new cable but no luck. But as soon as we disable UDLD on interface, interface brought up. and as soon as you enable UDLD interface goes to err-disable mode. Cisco TAC this this could be the spanning-tree loop, Really? UDLD run on physical layer how could spanning-tree can block or disable that port? 

Its very weird question but i want some suggestion for you. We have edge router where BGP running and internet connection is terminated. Now i want to configure ACL on router to keep bad traffic outside and only allow specific port. Following scenario. 

We have new customer and they said their traffic requirement is so i am planning to order some hardware and have some question or doubt in mind. I am planning to put for Core layer for L3 routing with HSRP and for Access Layer My question is does Nexus 5000 are capable to run full IP traffic? or any other suggestion would be welcome. 

My SNMP monitoring showing Nexus 3064 switch CPU utilization But on switch cpu history showing 72 Hour maximum CPU%, is this normal? 

Notes: Interesting thing i can't ping from to I am not sure what is other side of ISP, As per document .11 should ping .12 so they can say hello to each other using layer right? This is what i did but i think its wrong way to configure HSRP [SW1] 

We have one cisco L2 switch running very old software version but recently i got software from someone else (we don't have SmartNet on this switch). is it safe to upgrade from 5.0.3 to 7.0.1? I was trying to find prerequisite but i didn't find any so wonder if some already did in past please share your experience. UPDATE after upgrade from 5.0.3 to 5.2.1 (for safety) look like my fan speed bump up from 50% to 60%. here is the output 

We are planning to buy so have question related licensing, what comes with base model? we need following feature does base model cover that without any extra license? 

We have two server for SecureID token auth for VPN and i have configure (primary) but don't know how to configure (backup radius) This is what i have currently 

I heard can be issue but what if i increase MTU on point-to-point link? EDIT: From ISP we get IP subnet and we are running on Edge router, We don't want to use NAT because our service required public IP direct on server. Whole reason was using for host subnet and don't use any single IP from it for Point-to-Point link. My question was can i just use private IP between Router and L3 switch? 

Does following scenario work? We have single mode fiber running between two building, but we have MMF patchcord connected to SPF (SFP-10GBase-SR). 

This is going to be new network in my datacenter and i have question related vPC, as you can see i have A1/A2 switch (L3/L2 routing) in aggregation layer and C1/C2 switches for Core (L3 routing). I am planning to implement vPC between TOR and Aggregation layer to avoid STP and utilize full bandwidth. Question: If TOP switch send traffic to Aggr layer switch and it will send traffic to both link using hash algorithm in that case how A2 switch will send traffic to upstream core switch (L3)? Does A2 switch send traffic to A1 using trunk or it will send traffic directly to C2 switch and then C2 switch forward to C1 (because C1 is primary BGP switch) I am new in vPC so trying to understand how switch will handle upstream traffic. 

Can someone explain why OSPF picking long path here instead of sending traffic to (sw2) it is sending to (sw1)? EDIT OSPF database output: 

We upgraded SW1 with latest version and after upgrade UDLD failed between two switch. We disabled UDLD on that port and everything was working file data was flowing on link both direction. Later on upgrade switch with latest and greatest software fixed all issue and we re-enable UDLD and all good. 

In following scenarios Security Level (dmz-1) to Security level (dmz-2) traceroute not working. I think traceroute use specific port for unreachable function but in following scenario i don't know which udp port it's going to pick. I have following config 

UPDATE 2 Does this related to , Default its enabled on Nexus switches $URL$ It shouldn't impact forwarding traffic right? 

We have Cisco ACL configured for all inbound traffic and today i have add NTP to allow few remote NTP server to sync tim. I have created group and multiple remote NTP server in that group. This is my ACL 

We are in VoIP business and running RTP/SIP traffic 80% in our network we have other servers also like www and monitoring and operation, our network is very flat and simple also we have very basic configuration on switch and switches, we are running couple of VLANs to separate traffic and everything running without . Now we are thinking to implement because it's very important for real time protocols but have no idea how and what is the best practice to implement and do we really need QoS, there are many un-answered question i have and don't know how to start and where to start to implement QoS, so looking for expert advice or suggestion to see what we can do to make it better. Following is diagram of network to give you idea. 

If i am trying to shutdown 2G trunk then on Nexus switch i am seeing following spanning-tree status which is weird 

In ASA i am seeing two rules default rules on ASDM. what kind of rules these are, look like they comes from but i wonder what traffic they allow? 

I have HSRP running on two L3 switch and i change priority to higher but it didn't failover, why? SW1 

We have purchased and output showing following, in it's showing does that means i can't configure ?? 

I have cisco ASA firewall and curious can i disable connection tracking for specific rules or protocol. In short i want to disable connection tracking for traffic. because UDP is connection less, it doesn't have any state like etc.. what is the purpose of tracking them. I want to exclude them from my ASA rules. UPDATE I have quick check in ASA and following traffic we are inspecting. if there is no UDP/SIP there then who is filling connection table? 

This is the scenario i have link from my ISP running BGP on it, now i need more capacity so order second 10G_B link with new handoff and new Public IP pool and terminate on same Nexus switch in that case i should use VRF right? to isolate both link routing. Or i am missing something to understand VRF? EDIT My goal is how do i handle two handoff link from ISP with different class-C subnet and how do i route traffic for Subnet-A goes to 10G_A and Subnet-B goes to 10G_B link? If it's not possible with VRF then what would be the best solution here? 

We were running on single since long time but today two purchased secondary (standby) for redendency. Now question is how do i upgrade IOS on secondary RP2? I am confused with ISSU method, I thought ASR1006 is hardware redundant so it doesn't need ISSU, so we individually upgrade and without any ISSU, i may be wrong. can someone explain how does ISSU process work and how i can use it to upgrade ASR1006? 

I have three service group, . I wanted to isolate using mask and divide them in logical subnet. Example: We have 192.168.100.0/24 subnet, In short i want to give 50% IPs to WWW and 25% - SMTP and rest 25% FTP 

I am trying to upgrade from to , before upgrade i want to make sure it pass all checks but i got this error. This switch isn't in production yet but want to make sure it goes well and smooth. Am i doing something wrong? show version: 

This is strange requirement but thought let me ask if some has good advice, so we have Linux firewall with 3 interface, public, Internal and DMZ now we decided to replace linux firewall with Cisco ASA 5585, Its production environment. Plan is to take over IP so i will shutdown Linux firewall and put its IP address on so how much time it will take to flush all ARP cache on entire network? I can change IP address in 1 min but i am not sure how long all and will take to flush their arp table and learn new MAC, all the clients are linux base. any advice? 

from PC to PC - Ping successful from PC to ASA interface - Ping Failed from PC to ASA interface - Ping Failed 

we have c3850 trunk with other switch 4948 and its LACP 4x1G interface bonding (etherchannel) out of 4 1G we are getting on 2 interface. This is all started yesterday when i upgrade software on this switch before that everything was good. doesn't make sense. I have done this upgrade on other switches to but no issue so far. 

what is UDLD why it's causing this issue. Last week we upgrade one of switch with latest firmware but still second switch running on older code do you think it could be version mismatch issue? UPDATE SW1 

I can ping outside world but not able to access web/dns etc.. Do i need to add specific access list to allow traffic inside ---> outside? Update [Windows 2012]------------[ASA 5505]----------------[INTERNET] 

EDIT: Our total utilization on link is 400Mbps, and i am seeing all link using around ~100 Mbps individually (few bytes here and there). I am not seeing any performance issue on network. this trunk is connected to other switch and they are also running same speed interface 4x1G. I have upgrade multiple switch with same software and they all working fine without any interface error. 

We have two cisco they are uplink with fiber port 10G and i am seeing this error on that trunk (uplink) port 

We have Router and it has two ISP [ISP1] & [ISP2] and i got two /24 subnet and and they are connected to router at following interface.
