So, you went from the system working, to connecting three different components to the PSU. Any one of the three could have been the culprit, since the system ceased to function properly after that. The problem with your diagnostic process, is that you did not connect only one at a time to the PSU. Would it have made all that much of a difference at this point? It appears not, since you disconnected the drives and it did not function. It appears that connecting one of those three components damaged the motherboard... which would point to the issue being the hard drive, the optical drive or the case fan. I know, it is unlikely it is the case fan, but still. You could test those three components in another computer, but I'd hate to see you waste another motherboard. 

As was pointed out in the comments, we can't make shopping recommendations. The reasons are explained in the FAQ. The fact that the system is just "collecting dust" raises the question of why it is sitting idle. If you find the system can't adequately play the games you want to play, then you probably cannot continue to say that you are looking for a "casual gaming" system. If you find that the system does not pack enough muscle for the video and photo editing that you do now, then you are not looking for something relatively simple and you need something more at the level of a professional rig. You would be looking for cutting edge, top-of-the-line hardware... and for that, there are multiple web sites out there. You can start at one of any online retailers (Newegg, etc) or even retailer portals (Pricewatch, etc) and start looking at the more expensive stuff that is offered. Check the specifications, compare prices, and decide on what you want. Again, as you have already heard from Duncan though... what you've got is plenty for what you say you want to do. 

As has been already said... there isn't enough to go on. It could be any of the components attached to the motherboard. Seriously. It could be the video card, one of the sticks of RAM, the processor itself, the power supply... it could even be a capacitor that is damaged (but not to where you can see the issue). As you point out, you do not have the equipment to test all these components, or to even test the motherboard independently with a different processor. This means that you are essentially stuck. You could test the power supply, RAM, and Video card on another computer. You could test this motherboard and processor with a different PSU, video card, and different RAM. 

Ok. First, I need to make the disclaimer that I only have what you put in the question to work with. This means that if it actually turns out that you did things OTHER than what you said you did... it is not my fault that I did not know this information ahead of time. As much as we would love to assume people have performed certain steps, or that they know crucial bits of information.... not everyone has or does. That said. Are you aware of the Dell Support site? More importantly, are you aware that you can go to the Dell support site, and you can click on Drivers and Downloads, enter the service tag (on a sticker on the bottom of the laptop) and get right to a Driver download page for that model? You can also just search by model, and get there... as I did here. Now, you left out the detail as to whether you installed Windows 7 32 bit or 64 bit. Does it really make a difference? Apparently not in this case, as the ATI Mobility driver installation file is the same regardless. Of course, I don't know which you have, and it seems that Dell released that model over time... one with a 6000 series, and one with a 7000 series... So, this is the AMD ATI Mobility Radeon HD 6470 driver download page for your model. And here is the Dell ATI Mobility Radeon HD 7450M/7650M driver download page for your model. Of course, rather than just downloading the one for your laptop from one of those two links, I would actually use the service tag on your laptop to bring you to the specific driver download page (as I mentioned above), and you should choose your exact version of Windows from the pulldown menu on the page before you go to the Video section at the bottom and download the appropriate ATI drivers. You might ask why Windows didn't just grab the appropriate drivers all on it's own with an update? Well... for two reasons. For one, it isn't Window's responsibility to maintain an up to date database of all hardware drivers. That's why manufacturers like Dell provide support sites like this. For another, your AMD/ATI video chipset isn't active when you are in Windows. The Intel integrated chipset is active. Windows doesn't detect anything but the Intel chipset, because that is all that is being used. ATI doesn't detect that the card is present, because for all intents and purposes... it isn't. It is only used and present when there is a demand (like a game). The Dell driver installation program takes this into account, and puts everything into place. As you already know.... next time, take the hardware drivers into account before you reinstall. But then again... you really just need to remember the Dell Support page (or whatever manufacturer product page for whatever computer you are dealing with). 

The current RFID reading hardware has no documentation for you to familiarize yourself with. The current RFID reading hardware is cobbled together in a hap-hazard fashion, with the emphasis on hazard. The project needs to have a budget that you can work within, that will actually allow for the completion of the project. Since you have been handed this project, and you are new to the hardware, software, and technology involved, you need to be able to use hardware and software that has documentation you can follow, to allow you to actually complete the project. The Powers-That-Be will appreciate being able to maintain this project, regardless of whether you are attached to it, if the hardware and software involved can be easily replaced in case of failure, and the documentation for said hardware and software is readily available. Moreover, your notes on getting it all to work would make it much easier for the next person in the future. 

You state that you don't have internet access on that machine to use a driver finder. You don't need to install a driver finder. If you went to the Packardbell.com support site, you would have seen that they used three different wireless cards in the assembly... not in one laptop, mind you. So, first, you get yourself a USB flash drive, or a computer that can burn a CD and a blank CD. That is to say you get EITHER the USB flash drive OR you set yourself up with the ability to burn a CD. Then, you download all three of these packages DIRECTLY FROM PACKARD BELL. Yes, that's right. Packard Bell provides driver support for the hardware they sell. And here are direct links for the Windows 7 drivers (as that is what is initially provided by Packard Bell). Atheros Broadcom Realtek If for whatever reason you cannot download from those links, just start with going to the Packard Bell website, choose your country, hover over the support link, click download center to bring you here, and enter the model (TK11BZ) for your laptop. Now, once you download all three of those installation packages, you save them all to the USB flash drive, OR you burn all three of the installation packages to a CD. You then take that flash drive or CD and put it in the Easynote. You then install ALL three. Do you need to install all three? Nope. You only need to install the correct one. Will installing the wrong one hurt your computer in any way? Nope. If you install a wireless driver for a wireless card you don't have, your OS will ignore the driver. For those who would argue this point, they need only think about how a computer could possibly continue to function after installing the drivers needed for a USB wireless Nic, after you have unplugged the wireless Nic. I mean... OMG!! There are wireless drivers installed for a wireless card that isn't present... and the computer still functions fine! Yes, there are things you can do to attempt to identify exactly what wireless card is in your laptop. You can read the label on the bottom of your laptop, since there should be a notification regarding your country's regulations on allowing wireless interference, and that notification should state the company's name (Realtek, Broadcom, Atheros) in the notifcation. Or, you could take the cover off the panel on the bottom that is covering the wireless card and actually look at it, and either read the paper notification taped to it, or look at the main chip and see if it is says Broadcom or Realtek or what-have-you. Or you could follow the steps suggested in the other answer. Yes, you can take the time to identify exactly which card is there, and then only install the one that applies. However, it isn't necessary. If you install each until the wireless card works, then Windows will ignore the others that don't apply. The point is, you Download the driver installation packages from Packard Bell for your model laptop, and you bring them to the computer without internet access using a portable storage medium. That solves both issues you mentioned.
