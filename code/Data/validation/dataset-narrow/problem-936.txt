...and compare it to the metadata of a file that opens as expected. Maybe , or show something odd? (Some shameless plug for Apple Mail, and surely not an answer to your question, so just in case you cannot fix it and are considering if you should kiss Thunderbird goodbye: Apple Mail works fine with the Energy Saver –Thunderbird always kept my Macs from sleeping, but haven't used it for 3 years– and is Time-Machine-aware. When entering Time Machine while Mail is active, you'll get the galaxy thingy for Mail rather than for Finder. You can then even find messages for accounts that don't exist anymore, and to restore them you don't need to know how Mail stores the messages on your hard disk.) 

Next, type the commands in bold, like in Terminal on a Mac or a DOS prompt in Windows. Don't change the dummy : 

Small chance it's related (but the screenshot looks alike) and even then: very small chance this will help. But the Dutch government and Kaspersky Lab have found some decryption keys for "CoinVault ransomware" that is worthwhile to know about; see $URL$ 

Sounds like your computer's clock or time zone is not set correctly. By the way: it seems the error code is clickable, so probably gives you more details? 

If you need netcat, you can whitelist netcat.exe in your anti-virus program. You may also want to download a current version, which is called ncat and can be found in the nmap distribution. 

As others already pointed out, your NAS most certainly cannot be used in USB slave mode. However, if you would like full access to it, you can SSh into it. Or you can mount it in your Debian server using sshfs. 

go to Account Settings -> Synchronization & Storage and uncheck "Keep messages for this account on the computer". under Account Settings -> Server Settings, take note of the relevant "Local directory". exit Thunderbird in that "Local directory" and it's subfolders, delete the mailbox files (the files which have no extension). But keep the .msf index files and the .sdb files. 

If you want to automate the settings for Aero Peek and Desktop Composition, you can tweak these registry settings: 

If using a chroot jail (), check that the FTP user's home directory is indeed the directory it should be. And if the directory is a mount point or under a mount point, check that the right disk is indeed mounted there. 

Many players support ASS tags in .srt files. Below is an example using ASS positioning tags which work in both VLC and SMplayer in Linux, and probably in many other players and other OSes. Note that the accepted answer suggests an older version of the SSA format, using instead of . The numbers used in the older format are also different, and that format is considered deprecated. The newer format uses the numpad layout for the numbers. While SMplayer correctly displays both formats, VLC only accepts the current format. 

This surely only works when saving from, say, Notepad, and then also keeps the default from being added. I am not 100% sure it also worked in Windows Explorer. In Windows XP, it does not work from Windows Explorer though, as one cannot even type quotes then. And without the quotes it would yield "You must type a file name." because it doesn't like the leading dot. The same errors when using the dialog as shown using right-click » Properties.) 

What behaviour would you expect? Isn't that like Paste (Ctrl+V on Windows, hence Command-V on a Mac?) See also Apple's Switch 101: The former PC user's guide to getting the most out of your Mac. 

You seem to imply that having Firebug installed also makes it run for each site. On my Mac, Firebug 1.4.x is disabled (grey icon) until I explicitly open it. Then, when switching to another window the icon will still be coloured, but clicking any link on that other site will show the grey icon again. So, it will check the URL, but that should be about it. So: is the Firebug icon coloured in your Firefox? (Detailed info at How to enable and disable Firebug 1.4) 

...makes both $URL$ and $URL$ go to 127.0.0.1, hence: your own machine. (Even more: anything that refers to , such as or would go to 127.0.0.1 when run from your computer.) Apparently you have a web server running on your own computer on port 80 (HTTP), but nothing on port 443 (HTTPS). Even more, getting actually proves your file is used, as otherwise you would see the default website from $URL$ Note that if you would have the server on your computer also support HTTPS on port 443, you'd get certificate errors, as there is no way you can buy a certificate for the domain . 

For example, I use the option, which "tells rsync to look for per-directory .rsync-filter files that have been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their rules to filter the files in the transfer." My contains lines like these to filter out these "droppings" that Macs leave behind them: 

Indeed, the missing keys on Macbooks (and many Windows notebooks) are something extremely annoying. Normally, on Macbook keyboards, you get Home / End with fn-Left / fn-Right and PgUp / PgDown with fn-Up / fn-Down However, as you noticed, this doesn't work in Terminal apps like nano, Midnight Commander, less, etc. In Terminal, you need to add Shift to let them "pass through" to Terminal. Home : Shift-fn-Left End : Shift-fn-Right PgUp : Shift-fn-Up PgDn : Shift-fn-Down Of course, when what you really need happens to be Shift-Ctrl-Home ... forget it! (Or connect a real keyboard) And Midnight Commander users will want to know that the missing Insert key can obtained with Ctrl-T 

This seems to be Bug #1736116 "[SRU] Host with kernel 4.13 freezes when starting a VM with VirtualBox" There is now a fix in the virtualbox packages version 5.1.34, available in the in the xenial-proposed repository, and hopefully soon in the main repository. For a quick copy/paste solution, this worked for me: 

Try for yourself here. (As an aside: Firefox shows that with an overlay on the source page only, and then shows that page with full control. Firefox itself does not take focus, nor makes its dock icon bounce though. Internet Explorer shows a close icon, which is effectively the same as clicking OK. And I very much agree that there's no security issue with such dialogs—anything that can be done after the dialog was shown, could be done without it as well. So: simply clicking OK might be easiest, maybe quickly followed by pressing Esc to stop loading whatever page is loaded next.) 

I think you actually might not want to use that proxy, as I expect you do not want to send ALL traffic through the customer's server. The fact that you cannot browse without that proxy is probably an indication that you are actually sending ALL traffic through the VPN. When all traffic is sent through the VPN, then even "normal" internet access (like web browsing or maybe even sending and fetching email) is routed through the remote VPN server. This might be useful when traveling in some countries that filter certain web sites. And as the VPN connection is encrypted, using it for all traffic might also be more secure when not knowing who can listen in to the network that is used to connect to the internet (hotel, internet café, Starbucks WiFi, ...). Above all: it might be a bit more secure as any "hacker" (trojan horse, spyware) who has gained access to your workstation will be disconnected as soon as the VPN connection is started, thus not exposing the server's network to that security threat. It depends on the set up of the VPN server whether or not such unwanted trojan traffic could be re-established through the VPN server. To avoid security issues, internet access through the VPN server is often simply disallowed. So, sending all traffic through VPN may very well be preferred in many occasions, and often one should NOT try to bypass any limitations as set up by the administrator. But I wonder if that is true while connecting to a customer's VPN server. I would say: 

Yes. I'm currently trying to investigate such a problem. However, I don't know if there is a difference between drag/drop and copy/paste. Apparently, there are differences between different copy programs. I experienced corrupted copies with drag/drop in Windows Explorer, but not with another file manager (Total Commander). Have yet to test copy, xcopy and others. My problem is hardware related, but yes, Windows can, in some particular circumstances create non-identical copies, without realizing it and without showing an error. I would have thought that any copy program would eventually end up using the same Windows internal copy routine, but apparently not. Still, it would be surprising if the same program (Windows Explorer) used 2 different copy routines depending on how the copy was initiated. 

On my machine with OS X 10.9.5, it was Image Capture which opened automatically instead of Photos. But anyway, the solution may be the same. The solution in the accepted answer unfortunately didn't work for me. But this worked: 

(Of course, that should be exactly the same as copying from the Get Info windows, but obviously it isn't in Lion 10.7.4). This created the 2 files you would expect on the destination: and it's resource fork . However, it also created another file which seems essential. It is displayed as in the Mac Terminal, but got a weird name on the Samba share, probably to work around the illegal trailing dot. (on my machine, Samba replaced the trailing dot with the UTF8 "private" character xEFx80xA9) Update: Even when copying from Preview, it does not always work with NFS. It does sometimes!?!... Copying the files from a FAT32 drive (which also has the extra file) to the NFS share doesn't work. What does seem to work reliably is terribly convoluted, but anyway, here it goes: 

The URL refers to an external JavaScript library, that holds functions the web page might be using in some inline JavaScript of its own. In most (if not all) browsers, nothing in the page is rendered until all inline scripts are done executing*. Even when the inline JavaScript does not need anything from that external JavaScript libraries, your browser needs to download all of the defined external libraries first, just in case they are needed. So, if the external script is not in your browser's cache† (or: whenever you explicitly refresh your browser‡) then everything halts until the script is downloaded. The URL loads fine on my internet connection and I assume Safari and Chrome still have the library in their caches? As for the very slow proxy: this could be some virus scanner (not too likely on your Mac) or some firewall? If the problem is in the proxy then that's out of your control, so (assuming you need to use that proxy): contact the administrators? Meanwhile, you could repeat your test for other libraries hosted at Google, like jQuery 1.3.2 or jQuery UI 1.7.2. (If really all else fails, then you could try to find some way to rewrite request for to a URL of some other host...) 

Is that a hexadecimal key, or a passphrase? When using a passphrase then, according to Choosing a password for networks that use Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP): 

Youtube supports some formatting in WebVTT (.vtt) subtitle files. It may only be visible after the subtitles are "published", and viewed on the standard youtube page, not in the edit page. The advantage of .vtt is that in it's basic form, it's very close to the common .srt format. Just add "WEBVTT" at the top, followed by an empty line, and replace commas in timecodes by dots. If you are on Mac or Linux, you can convert a SubRip file to .vtt with this command: 

For some reason, the solution in an alias, as suggested by user szkj, didn't work correctly for me. While it did preserve commands executed in the MC subshell, commands entered before starting MC were lost after exiting. Finally, I use the following in , without an alias. It seems to work fine despite the fact that overwrites . 

You can enable writing to HFS+ in Linux even if you didn't disable journaling. In addition to hfsplus which you already have, you need to have hfsprogs installed: 

I do that so I can use a comfortable file manager (MC) and my usual shell configuration instead of what I would get in the NAS shell. 

Not sure if is really needed, or if it would also work without it. Maybe it depends on the OS version. 

Just in case it's only for web browser traffic after all (I know you prefer otherwise), and you're on Windows: Fiddler? 

If you want to stick with Finder (rather than using some third-party file manager such as Path Finder), then I don't know if there's an easy way to get what you want in one click. But, to run Finder as root: 

† So yes, Facebook knows which web sites you're visiting, for all sites that include some Facebook widget, even if that's only the "Like" button. Stop using Facebook if that bothers you, or at least install something like Privacy Badger. 

For public IP addresses, some sites such as WhatIsMyIPAddress.com† claim their databases can tell if your IP address is static or dynamic. Also, sometimes running a might reveal a DNS name that includes some hints from your provider, like prefixes. It's all not standardized though, so indeed the best bet is to get that information from your provider. † In my case the answer is correct; see the "Additional IP Details" button. 

That's it! Typing in the URL bar, followed by a space will get you "Search subreddit", after which you can type any of its names: 

The given IP addresses belong to Verizon Mobile. So, you've probably been assigned those IP addresses yourself when you were using your phone. Your mobile provider could always give you the same, "static", IPv6 address, but it seems Verizon wants US$ 500 for that. (I'm not sure if this is only supported for their USB modems, or also for phones.) Without such static IP address you're sharing a "dynamic" address with others, and that could even change when moving from one cell tower to the other. You can investigate yourself using websites such as whatismyip.com in the browser on your telephone. Finding the location for static IP addresses is already hard. But for dynamic IP addresses on mobile networks, chances are even bigger that Google shows you the wrong location. Like, wild guesses:
