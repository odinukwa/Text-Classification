With Powershell, I can request the current screen resolution. this is not what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to find the maximum resolution I can set the screen to (slider all up). Is this even possible from Powershell/Command line? After I got the maximum resolution, I want to set the screen to this resolution. So I'm just looking for a way to set the screen to the highest resolution possible. 

it can't find my drivers. However, When I right click a missing device, and click on Update Driver Software, the driver gets installed. I Don't browse for the driver, I choose Search automatically for updated driver software and I'm doing this WITHOUT internet connection. So I'm pretty sure it's getting the driver from my driver share, right? 

Does the latest original Office 2010 download, from the Microsoft website, contain SP2? I'm looking for an answer on this question, but I can't seem to find it. I've tried to slipstream SP2 (+ all other updates after SP2) into my Office 2010 image, but now my 'Updates' folder is full of junk. Also, there is an .MSP in it to automate the installation. I don't know if this has effect on the installation on the updates? Now I want to start with a clean image. So, does the latest download include SP2? Thank you very much. 

I'm looking for a way to block javascript for specific websites in Internet Explorer, like YesScript does in Mozilla Firefox. Is there a plugin or a way to do this? It seems like this is not possible in IE. 

You need to create an A-Record (of www) that will point to the public IP of your webhost. This will make your website available for everyone. For mail, you need to create another A-Record, that will link eg. mail.domain.com to the public IP of your mailserver. Besides that, you need to create an MX-record that points to the mail.domain.com record. $URL$ 

I'm looking for a way to automatically install missing drivers on newly installed machines. All the machines are the same brand and model, so I created a shared folder that hass all the drivers in it. On the machine, I edit the following registry key: 

To try and fix this, I click Action, Scan for hardware changes. After a few seconds, I get the following information 

Probably, only Mac Addresses that are known are allowed to browse the internet. It's a policy that's used in many, many schools. 

I've made a reboot function that includes a Start-Sleep of 60 seconds. This way, I'm sure nothing happens after the Restart-Computer command is executed. 

I've tried devcon.exe /rescan, but this doesn't even try to install the drivers. It does nothing so far I can see. I'm also not looking for third party software like Driver Genius. I Want to install the drivers, automatically, from the driver share that I maintain. Thank you 

So, you are saying that if you transcode an MP3 to WAV, that it's lossless? WAV is an uncrompressed loseless format, MP3 is a 'lossy' format. Lossy formats are always compressed. When you transcode from lossy to lossless, you will end up with a file that looks lossless, but it really isn't. You can check this by applying 'spectral analysis' on the file. The image below show a lossless file, that is transcoded from an MP3. Can you see the shelf at 16 kHz? In a uncrompressed losseless file (like WAV), the shelf shouldn't be there. 

By default, this value is %SystemRoot%\inf, but I changed this to %SystemRoot%\inf;\\SERVER\drvstr to also include my driver share. Now, after the installation of Windows, A few drivers are missing as you can see in the picture. Weird, because it must search the drivers in my driver share (right?). 

You need to port forward the SSH port to the internal address of your Linux machine. The default port is 22. Also, you need to make sure that you allow every IP in your sshd_config file. 

When I'm doing a dir of a folder (in CMD) and I look at the filesize, it difference from the filesize that Windows Explorer is giving me (in the detailed view). Is this normal behaviour? Thank you. 

I'm looking for a way to restart a computer with PowerShell (), at a given time (Example: 03:00AM). The PS-Script itself will run at a random time, when the user executes it, so it's no option to schedule the script at 03:00AM. My first thought was to schedule a task, at 03:00AM (with PowerShell) that will execute the reboot for me. This is possible (I think) with in PowerShell 4.0. The downside is that I'm not sure if the computers that will run this script have PowerShell 4.0. Is it possible to schedule a task with PowerShell 2.0, or is there another way to reboot the computer at a given time? Thank you 

I am using EverNote from the web interface and have removed all my notes, but the tags which were previously associated with those notes have not been removed. Is there a way to automatically remove unused tags without doing it manually for each item? 

It is very possible! But judging by the simplicity of your question, I assume you would like to simply run a program which will magically make your computer twice as fast, which is not possible. You need to understand that when a program runs it maintains its state by provoking the CPU to move memory between the HDD, RAM, and CPU registers, as well as addresses on various components (such as video cards or network cards). The trouble with using a CPU from another computer to help you is that it needs access to the same memory. And maintaining a mirror image of your computers memory on another computer requires so much overhead that it easily defeats the purpose of trying to add another computer to gain performance :) But the type of things which can be split among multiple computers are image rendering or some mathematical calculations which can work independently. 

How to use Remote Disc to share DVDs or CDs on a Mac or Windows-based computer I am pretty sure that if you have legally purchased the software that you would be authorized to download it? Don't take my word for it though, its just my thought. If you have a friend with identical hardware to yours, put your hard disk into their machine and install using their optical drive. 

Use the Import Mailboxes feature of Mail to copy the messages to mail, where you can copy them back onto the server (which is possible because it uses IMAP). 

I have used Entourage to access a POP mailbox where it would delete messages once they had been received, and would now like to use Mail(.app) to read my mail using IMAP. Is it possible to place the messages that Entourage removed from the server back so that Mail can access them? 

I dont know what version it is, but there is a new xcode supplied with snowleopard which should fix your problem. 

I have taken some photos from a recent vacation, but forgot to set the "away" time, so the time is slightly off. Thats not much of an issue since its only an hour from my home time, but my partner also took photos, but she was smart enough to adjust the time, so when merged together the overlap is annoying. Is there an easy way (preferably in iPhoto) to adjust the time that the photos were taken? 

Microsoft Window SteadyState looks like a fairly good candidate for making Microsoft Windows resistant to changes. 

I would like to know if it is safe to store the 1Password data file on DropBox? It can be safely assumed that there are a LOT of people already doing it without any negative security side effects, but I would still like some additional confirmation before taking the plunge. 

The only real benefit in dual booting (as opposed to running a virtual machine) is that you have full access to the host machines hardware instead of "virtual" hardware. 

You either have to go out of your way (removing hard disk, risky downloading) or spend some money (external drive, or get yours fixed). Unfortunately there is no solution which will be cheap AND easy. 

I have a few apps on my iPhone, and would like to sync them with iTunes without erasing them from my phone. Is this possible without downloading them all again? 

I have installed the windows version of gVim, which comes with "gVim Easy", a version of VIM configured to make it very easy to use by constandly being on insert mode, however most of the power of the editor is lost this way, because there is no way to get into command mode. Is there a way to get into command mode using "gVim Easy" ? 

If I purchase a song on my iPhone, will I be allowed to download it on my iMac for free? Usually I purchase music on my Imac and transfer it to my phone, but I am away from my desktop and would like to download an album on my phone, then download the same content on my desktop later. Does iTunes work like this? 

I keep getting email which was sent to a group but I need to reply to only one person. unfortunately I am a little trigger happy with the "reply to all" button and need to do something about it. Is there a way to either: 

It's certainly possible if the computer has a 25-pin serial port. I once did a database migration by printing the entire database to a computer over a serial link, capturing the output to disk, and then parsing the data into the new database. I believe that USB to 25-pin-serial adaptors are available. 

Try using Disk Utility to repair file permissions -- with any luck, that should reset the setuid bit on the /usr/bin/sudo that you copied. It's a flag that lets sudo act as root even when it's not run as root, which obviously it needs to be able to do, but you'll need sudo to set it using the command line so you have a chicken-and-egg problem. 

In theory, there is, based on finding the network latency between the IP address and a large number of routers with known locations. See this paper. I'm not aware of any commercial implementations, and it would be a lot of work to implement for yourself. 

OK, it looks like either /var/lib/mysql doesn't exist or the mysql user doesn't have permission to access it. Either way, you have worse problems than having forgotten the root password -- either you don't have a database at all, or something has changed the file permissions or ownership. 

All modern operating systems use otherwise unused memory for caching data so that it can be accessed from fast RAM instead of slower storage. They will generally report this as free memory, since applications can clear the cache and use it if they need to, but it's still actually being used. The less of it there is, the less data can be cached, and the slower the computer will be. 

Imagine auditing a data centre with 200 racks filled with 4,000 devices, many of which are years old. Imagine trying to determine what they all are, what software stack they're running, what they do, whether upgrades are available, whether the upgrades cost money, and whether their IPV6 support is buggy (which a lot of it is, because it's fairly new and hasn't had extensive use in a live environment). Now imagine testing all that to convince your board of directors that it's safe to push the switch and enable IPV6 in your network. The specific issue mentioned in the article to which you link is that a small percentage of Internet users (maybe 0.05%) are on networks that have IPV6 connectivity enabled but non-funtional (for various reasons), so that if a website offers an IPV6 option, they will try to use IPV6 to access it, and fail (or suffer very poor performance). 0.05% may not sound very much, but it's over a million people. 

Try the following. It uses the fact that you can extract the daytime measurements to subtract the daytime element from the total, giving the overnight average. 

Zip doesn't just store the contents of the file, it also stores file metadata like the owning user id, permissions, creation and modification times and so on. If you have one file you have one set of metadata; if you have 10,000 files you have 10,000 sets of metadata. 

It does only blink when there's data being transferred, but there's always data being transferred, even when you're not doing anything with the network yourself. There are all kinds of things to keep the network infrastructure working like ARP requests, broadcast messages, service announcements, and so on. They're not very much data, but they're very frequent. 

You have two different Applications folders. There's ~/Applications, which is the one under your own directory, and is for applications that you want to install for your use only. There's also /Applications, which is the main application folder, for use by all users on the machine, and is where the App Store and applications that have installers will normally install themselves. It sounds like you've copied everything from /Applications into ~/Applications, and I'd recommend just deleting it all from ~/Applications (once you've verified that it's all still in /Applications as well) and keeping all your applications in /Applications. 

Just because you've set up a DNS A record for example.dyn.org to point at a static IP address that your router doesn't actually have, that doesn't mean that your traffic will magically start to originate from that IP address instead of your dynamic IP address -- it will have no effect whatsoever on your IP address as seen by other people's firewalls, it will just stop people from connecting to you using the hostname. 

You have to create either an A record or a CNAME for dev.example.com in your DNS (or a wildcard record for *.example.com). Apache can't do anything with requests for dev.example.com if they can't get to your web server, which they can't do unless there's a DNS record that resolves for dev.example.com.
