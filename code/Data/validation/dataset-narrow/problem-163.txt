Choosing between these approaches depends on the hardware you've got. There are sometimes performance complexities or subtle restrictions eg max ether HWICs for a chassis. My understanding is that some Cisco L3-capable interfaces can be put into L2 mode, and they enter this by the command; but some require "subinterfaces", see below. A structure which is extremely common is sometimes called "router on a stick". A router is configured with one L3 towards internet, and one set as a trunk port towards a switch. The switch has many VLANs; the router has many lines. Note also the so-called "Layer 3 Switch", which is a switch with a router in it that can be enabled in configuration. The difference between a router with a switch in it and a switch with a router in it is mostly one of engineering emphasis; for many purposes it's just a question of which has got the interfaces you want, and perhaps the routing protocols and higher level functions. 

2-pair crossover was for ethernet but also allowing other use of the cable, such as phone usage. 4-pair crossover is just for ethernet, but is needed if you have 4-pair ethernet. We liked straight white for voice, yellow straight for ether, red for crossover. 2-pair crossovers went in the bin. Etherent crossover cables are not much used now that auto-crossover ethernet ports are so common. Flat swap cables are mostly common in Cisco-type RS-232 console use, and is normally "flat" cable, not twisted pairs. It is, of course, a crossover cable, but not for ethernet. 

"just in a lab" and "few extensions" makes me think your PSTN calls will be few; in which case you're better off with a SIP supplier, local to your country. 

If you're doing it by computer, obviously it's done in binary. But given you want to do it by hand ... You add the numbers directly in base 256. Just as we learned to add base 10 or base 12, we write the numbers in columns worth 1, 256, 256², 256³. When you add a column and it goes over 255, you have to carry. It looks ugly because base-256 digits take more than one character to write. First convert 1023₁₀ to base 256: divide by appropriate powers of 256, keep remainder: 1023₁₀ = [3][255]₂₅₆ 

But if you have spoke routers that have dynamic IP addresses which aren't known, you can't create a host route for them. In this case you can create a front door vrf in order to use two default routes without breaking your tunnels. You place your external interface into the new vrf. 

Look into enabling BFD. BFD is a separate protocol that EIGRP can subscribe to for failure detection. It can provide sub-second failure detection in a LAN environment, but you don't want that over a lossy WAN connection like the internet. You'll tune the timers higher for the WAN, but the advantage with BFD is you can configure BFD dampening. When you are on the border of a cell/sat connection you can get a lot of flapping back and forth when using low timers, if you configure dampening it will detect the flapping and stop the convergence for a time period to stabilize the connection. 

You can't route based on layer 7 application using only BGP. BGP features will only allow you to tweak the actual prefix advertisements/preference, not anything at layer 7. For active application inspection and policy routing you would need an external service provider to act as a reverse proxy for your public subnet. Then you would build a GRE tunnel from each of your ISP connections to this provider and they forward you the traffic down these tunnels. I haven't heard of anyone offering this type of application load balancing service, but it doesn't seem unrealistic since there are security services that operate in this same manner in order to "scrub" malicious traffic before sending it to your site. 

This depends on the model of device. Some of them have dedicated physical management interfaces. Others just use a vlan SVI interface. 

It seems your question is actually about duplicate IP addressing. If your system has the same IP address as a remote system, it will always choose itself because it believes that it owns that IP address and will never consider a remote system as having that IP. 

You don't need fabricpath to run a vPC+ from a FEX. Fabricpath is really only useful in large data centers where you have a multiple tier topology (Core, Aggregation, Access). In a smaller setup using a collapsed core type design, vPC is simpler and accomplishes the same goal of getting rid of spanning tree. 

You have as many of these as you need for DDI/DID and/or use pattern matching. Dial-peers for outgoing calls 

I have a customer that is getting a new 1Gbps ISP connection and wants his servers connected across two switches for redundancy and protection from: 

The goal is to protect against all of the failure modes and avoid MAC address flapping. It shouldn't matter which leg of the bond0 interface the Linux box uses to communicate the packet should find its way back without duplication or drops. The connections between the ISR4451X and each GS724Tv4 will use the SFP ports (port 23) and the interconnect between the switches can use SFP on port 24. These connections can be in access port or trunk port mode and with or without LACP. Can someone recommend the best approach? Mike 

I have a solution working with a Cisco 2800 acting as a Session Border Controller (CUBE) in front of an Asterisk box. The inbound patterns and outbound patterns don't overlap (for me) so its a matter of getting the SIP service/SIP UA working and defining voice peers for each direction. 

above does the default pattern for anything with a leading zero. Other patterns handle information numbers (operator, etc) and and a further pattern handles emergency numbers (999, 911, etc) 

More information You'll find more about using Cisco CUBE as an SBC in front of Asterisk on my blog article. 

2. Netgear GS724Tv4 switches On the switches I used the web-based interface and: a) create a new VLAN #100 b) made all copper ports work as access ports in VLAN 100 ('U' membership VLAN=100, 'untagged -> tagged' on egress with PVID=100) c) made the two SFP ports 'tagged' (trunk) ports d) enabled Rapid spanning-tree as the default 3. Results I now have both switches and the working and can: 

So, after some reading and experimenting I've come up with a solution that works for me using a BDI, VLAN and Rapid spanning-tree. The problem would appear that spanning-trees are 'per VLAN' because VLAN is a broadcast domain, hence I needed to use a VLAN. This is what I did: 1. On the Cisco ISR4451X a) configure Rapid spanning tree as the default b) configure the two interfaces in a 'service instance' with dot1q encapsulation and VLAN 100 c) arrange for the VLAN tags to be stripped d) configure one of the interfaces with a lower port priority than the other to give predictable start up e) configure the BDI with the layer-3 stuff (IPv4 and IPv6) The config looks like this: 

Now you can create a default route in the global routing table without interfering with the tunnel establishment. 

For point-to-point links, use a maximum size of /30. Depending on your model of router, it may support a subnet size of /31 which would be even better. Carve these small subnets out of your unused space. You can reserve a /24 network and use it only for p2p links, then take your smaller /30 /31 subnets from this space. 

BFD Overview BFD for EIGRP BFD Dampening You'll want to get some spare gear and test this out and tune it before configuring on all your production gear. 

Tuning requires a bit of trial and error since all situations are unique. I would suggest the following as a starting point: 

If you want to avoid pointing your default route to your ISP (maybe you want to point down a tunnel instead), you will need at a minimum to create a host route for the tunnel destination IP address pointing to the ISP. 

If you want to see power consumption of PoE, you can use "show power inline" command which will display power usage per port, plus total power and available power. 

I wasn't able to paste this picture in the comments. Usually what you want is your full mesh connections to all be in the backbone area 0. Then you split off other stub areas that are all attached to area 0. So all of your WAN links would be in area 0, then the links on the router towards the local site LAN would be in its own area. 

In the case of vPC configurations, both HSRP/VRRP peers will actively route packets when they receive them. It is a special behavior for vPC. Some information on vPC active/active routing 

Cisco routers support a type of dynamic access list called a reflexive access list. It observes outbound traffic and will automatically add an entry to the inbound access-list permitting the return traffic. 

The in the prompt indicates that you are already inside the tmsh shell. No need to prefix commands with tmsh. You would only do this if you were in the bash shell (to get there from tmos, type ). To get to the imish and zebos shells, you have to use or 

You can use VLANs of the routers to make a new network for the server. There are any number of ways of numbering your VLANs, this is just one. If you have an extra switch you can do this. 

The various regional internet registries have varying policies for bulk whois. I know that RIPE has rate limiting for personal information; and may well have for queries in general. You might find that one of RIPE's other interfaces is better suited for what you're doing, as it has many APIs, not just conventional whois. See $URL$ EDIT: RIPE is pretty clear about its policies and limits, see its Query Reference Manual, and Acceptable Use Policy, which give the details. 

All that works fine as described: we use dialer1 if it works, else vlan1000 if that works. The vlan1000 / fe3 config is just because the 867VAE doesn't have L3 ethernet ports. The question is about NAT: 

What else could this be? What changes can I make to the router to give more information or avoid the problem? The only workaround I've found is enabling telnet on R1, which obviously I'm loathe to do. Logs follow. Thanks in advance Jonathan Cisco is 867VAE with C860VAE-ADVSECURITYK9-M), Version 15.5(3)M 

I have a Cisco 867VAE with 15.5(3)M which is disconnecting from a particular legitimate SSH client with It's on a bench, not in service. I have full control over the Cisco R1 not much over the client. 

I don't disagree for a second with the description in previous answer, but as I assumed the 4500 packet was the whole length -- as that is what is compared to the MTU -- my arithmetic gives different answers for the final fragments B2 and C4 below. Assuming 20-byte headers throughout, a 2600-byte MTU will make maximum packets of 2596-bytes and a 1400-byte MTU will make maximum packets of 1396. 

Let us know how you get on Jonathan. PS "does packet arrive at router": Ashamed as I am to confess such things in a forum like this, I often debug DHCP packets on the router and send DNS queries at it from Unix command line. (The reason I'm so shameful is that the output is small and you don't have to get your ACL right, and "dig" or similar is extremely widely available without installation) 

Check your feasible successors. The big advantage with EIGRP is the use of feasible successors which is basically a backup route that EIGRP knows is loop-free and it can start using immediately if the primary route is lost. Since you are using default metrics, you need to tune the bandwidth and delay settings of your interfaces to make sure there is a feasible successor available. You can check for them in 

What if you don't use a patch panel, then decide you have to move your switch further down the rack or you need to move the connection to equipment in a different location in the rack? Now your cable is not long enough to reach the new location. You are screwed because now you have to run an entire new cable through the walls. With a patch panel you would just grab a longer patch cable and be done with it. 

The router is using proxy ARP. This is a feature enabled by default. Since the router knows how to reach the destination address, it will respond on the host's behalf with its own MAC address and all frames from the source will be sent to the router which can then route to the destination. Cisco Proxy ARP 

I think your issue is this command This disables negotiation of all capabilities, one of which is a 4byte AS 

If it supports LAG you can combine the redundant links into port-channels that are viewed as a single link. However, both of those links would have to connect to the same Cisco switch unless you are running VSS or Nexus vPC. 

You kind of answered it yourself. The advantage for each is an increased level of redundancy. The advantage of vPC is that is provides link redundancy as well as chassis redundancy. A dual-homed connection would be used for end devices that support port-channeling. For double-sided you of course need the downstream devices to also support vPC, such as a core layer of Nexus 9k connecting to a pair of Nexus 5k. 

It's because R1 doesn't know how to reach those other interfaces (it doesn't have routes for those networks). You need routes on R1 pointing to R2 for the other two subnets. R1 of course knows how to reach 172.16.2.2 because it has an interface on that network.
