In over 3 years with 5 Pis I have only had 2 failures requiring re-imaging cards (other than user induced problems) and 1 requiring reformatting cards - the latter was an error related to an upgrade attempt, not power related. I have often had power failures, and sometimes power off without shutting down. In all cases the file system has been repaired on startup. Ext4 is a journalling filesystem, and quite good at recovery. I can suggest one solution; get a SD card from a reputable manufacturer. Further note. OS corruption is not a problem specific to the Pi. Pulling the plug on any OS risks HD corruption. It used to be a real problem 30 years ago with DOS and pulling the plug on an old Windows machine invariably caused problems. Most modern computers have hardware to prevent this, but this is not there in the $25 Pi. 

Your question is imprecise. Can you manually or not at all, or is the question abnout ? I guess the drive doesn't mount at all. I mount regularly using e.g but then I don't want ANY drives to automount and I NEVER mount HFS drives as RW because Linux does not support journalling. 

Quite a few people have asked questions about so I decided to give it a try. It REALLY is basic! It doesn't install or . The instructions on $URL$ are even more basic. The instructions for setting up WiFi and Bluetooth on the Pi3 are kind of there, but leave connected to the console and fail to create the symlinks required by the There needs to be rules to create the link which can be installed with 

The Raspberry Pi 3 will be able to boot from PXE, although this is not yet available. The references to USB boot were a misinterpretation of the writeup in the MagPi. The Raspberry Pi 2 can do neither. 

What do you mean by "added a new user as root". There is already a user, although as normally on Debian it does not have a password, so cannot logon. It is inadvisable to fiddle with . Put everything back the way it was. If you want to create a new user with the same privileges as set the user to be a member of the same groups, in particular of group 

Yes. Indeed if you have a card which works on a Pi3 it will work on all Pi models. There are a few restrictions; if you have purchased licences for MPEG2 etc these are specific to a Pi. Some distributions e.g. Ubuntu will not work on earlier models. It is possible to configure the OS in such a way that operations will differ between models or individual Pi, but in general they should boot. You should not attempt to run the same image on multiple Pi; they should have individual hostnames and not attempt to use the same IP addresses. 

I have tried many different methods of directly connecting the Pi to a Mac, with limited success. It really depends on what you are trying to achieve. Enabling works (similar to the method you tried), but only if connected to a router. This seems of limited value - you might as well plug the Pi into a router. I enabled on my Pi running Raspbian and can connect from OS X using . (Append to to enable ipv6). Connect from OS X using either or more easily as Unfortunately and on the Pi cannot connect via ipv6, although these work using ipv4. (It may be possible using IP tunneling). A third possibility occurred to me; implementing on the Pi, but I have never tried it. 

They ARE normal GPIO pins, configured by default as inputs, unless you have configured them otherwise. The only difference from other GPIO is that these have 1.8kΩ pullups to 3.3V to facilitate I²C use. 

Frankly I have never been able to make head nor tail of this cryptic "documentation", but it works perfectly on my Pi without using this parameter. 

"the thing is i can't find on the internet a similar project" This is for the simple reason that it will NOT work. You are likely to blow up the Pi. On top of that you don't actually need a fan. 

As noted by Gotschi you can't mount an ext4 partition on the Mac, but you can backup the SD. The following is a script I use. This uses to find a disk with a Linux partition to automatically find the SD card. NOTE This takes quite a while to copy! 

I am not saying this is impossible, but the Pi doesn't even have the USART capabilities needed to support the data stream, let alone the decoding ability. Existing computer systems use a dedicated controller to interface to SATA. You could design something similar, and write the kernel drivers, but you would still need external hardware. The conventional approach can't be used because you don't have access to the Pi's bus. USB is the only user option available to the user; is possible the Foundation could integrate a SATA controller. 

To understand the recent changes to networking it helps to understand HOW and WHY they were made. includes a hook so it is no longer necessary to include it in intefaces. introduces predictable network interface names which have been used in other distributions for some time. This means and may not exist, and thus the older interfaces was no longer viable. You should be able to use the older interfaces if you delete and/or (I have not tested this myself, and do not know why there are 2 instances, although I had manually installed myself in Wheezy.) You should also also check whether you ACTUALLY have a , you can force to use the older scheme, but the newer scheme was introduced for a reason, particularly for those with multiple network cards. See How to set up networking/WiFi for more background. It may be possible to configure to use different wpa_supplicant.conf files, although I have never investigated this. Examination of shows it looks for files named , so you should be able to create interface specific files. 

I am pretty sure you won't find anything which will do this. It is not that hard to do. In the good old days when UARTs were expensive technology we used to do serial by bit-banging. Thee Pi could certainly do the same. It depends on how fast, how often data needs to be sent and how precise the timing needs to be. If only one-off or infrequent transmission is needed assemble the data (including any start bit or synch pattern) in an integer and shift out to a GPIO pin using a delay. You could use a timer interrupt for faster speeds. You could also use SPI to shift the data out for more demanding applications. 

The Pi should NOT "fall off the network". I have Pi3 running for months with no issues. When I first try to in after starting a remote computer it can take a while to respond, this is normal. will show settings for your WiFi, generally this includes Contrary to common opinions this does NOT disable wireless, it is a power saving issue, which influences how often the interface wakes up. You can try which disables wireless power management. A common cause of problems with the Pi (including wireless) is poor power supply or power cable. As you have not specified how you have configured your Pi it is not possible to comment, but poor settings can result in networks becoming unresponsive. The current default, using is very robust. 

You cannot monitor power usage on the Pi, although as @joan mentioned you can detect if the Pi exceeded the capacity. The current drawn can vary widely with load so this is not reliable (although if it indicates consistent low voltage this can be regarded as definitive). What you should do is add the current requirements of your peripherals and add ~700mA for the Pi. Unfortunately you cannot rely on the rated current capacity of most supplies. While I am sure they can safely supply the rated current they may not do so at voltage which the Pi regards as acceptable. The only way is to measure with an artificial load. 

The iPhone prompt includes the Unicode character U+2019 "single right quotation mark". This is valid (if very inconvenient). It is easy enough to include Unicode characters in strings. The following would echo this at the command prompt. 

You obviously had NOOBS installed, which has 2 partitions. DO NOT touch Recovery, which has all the distributions. If you had installed Raspbian from NOOBS you should still have the /boot partition. You could always try booting to NOOBS. I think by holding down the Shift while booting. 

Your question is rather confusing. If you are asking how to enable/disable GUI on logon execute where you will find a menu to set this. 

DO NOT do this!! Connecting a zener diode to a voltage source will release the magic blue smoke! It is unclear WHY you have most of these components. The capacitor will just increase the likelihood of damaging the GPIO (although the low impedance will probably protect it). If you are concerned about the possibility of exceeding the input voltage (which the capacitor almost guarantees) use a diode clamp to 3.3V OR just use 2 equal value resistors, which will give 2.5V - well above the threshold of the GPIO. (I am an electrical engineer ;-) 

While there have been problems in the past you are unlikely to experience problems but then you are unlikely to achieve anything. If you do run you can always go back with 

I have setup Ad-Hoc mode on my Pi3. This involves modification to network configuration file so you should first make a backup e.g. . Replace the file with the following:- 

Why do you want to "edit config.txt"? What are you hoping to achieve? Follow the instructions for "First boot" on $URL$ Following this config.txt will be on the OS boot partition, but you may not be able to see it on Windows, as I believe it does not support multiple partitions on SD. 

You don't specify which Pi, but for Pi3 You can draw 800mA from 3.3V and 1200mA (possibly more) from 5V, given an adequate power supply (2.5A). The actual current depends on what else you have connected. If you are drawing lots from USB, the 5V would be correspondingly reduced. Earlier models has lower capacity. See Raspberry Pi Power Limitations for more detail. 

You appear to have the Pi directly connected to the Mac but have obviously not configured the Mac correctly to allocate IP address, as the Pi is using a Link-local address. Even if you sort this out you WILL NOT be able to both access the Pi from the Mac AND access internet from the Pi. Nothing you can go on the Pi is going to change this (although advanced setup on the Mac to set up a bridge is possible). If you have a router connect the Pi to this (via Ethernet or WiFi). 

Indeed there seems to be little point in modern 40 pin Pi - which have a dedicated input which can be used to restart the Pi. PS If you are using the default seems unnecessary as there is an external pullup, and active_low is the default. 

You can create a shared directory on Windows in the normal way. (If you don't know how to do this the Pi site is not the best place to ask). The Pi can connect to the shared directory via (Samba). You will find lots of discussion on this. One tutorial $URL$ If you have more specific questions clarity your question. 

The output you posted explains why it is not working. and are both owned by If you run they should be owned by your user (probably ). NOTE do not run as I am not sure if normally has SUID permission, but if not you can set it with 

There is no simple way to do what you want. It can be done on a Linux machine (not Windows or Mac) but requires a detailed knowledge of Linux partition management. I suggest you use the following script to image the card and compress. This is as small as you can get. 

It is not AFAIK possible to select by SSID, but you can manually select with something like the following. 

If you decide to follow the unsupported "upgrade" from Jessie to Stretch you are expected to be able to resolve the many inconsistencies (including PHP5 and MySQL). If you were satisfied with Jessie, restore from your backup. Alternatively do a fresh install of Stretch (like almost everyone else). 

You could probably build something, but it is a really bad idea. Running a car battery down is a bad idea, both from the life of the battery and the impact it has on the car electronics. If you need to run the Pi in the car, you would be better to buy a battery (which you may already have) an an isolator, similar to those used to isolate fridges etc. in a 4WD. These are designed to protect the car battery from discharge by connected appliances, but keep an auxiliary battery charged. Run the Pi off the auxiliary battery. Only you can decide if this is needed. At 700mA the Pi should run off a car battery for more than 24 hours - longer if you use a 12v => 5v switch mode power supply. If you need longer, then you are going to need a pretty big battery.
