There is no "audit..." command option to exclude selected users. you can do it by enabling audit for all other users, example: 

Redo Log Buffers: A log buffer is a circular buffer in the SGA that holds information about changes made to the database. This information is stored in the redo entries. Redo entries contain the information necessary to reconstruct or redo changes made to the database by insert, update, delete, create, alter, or drop operations. Redo entries are primarily used for database recovery as necessary. Redo Log: The most crucial structure for recovery operations is the redo log, which consists of two or more preallocated files that store all changes made to the database as they occur. Every instance of an Oracle Database has an associated redo log to protect the database in case of an instance failure. for more information about database structure please refer to $URL$ 

Method 2: use the following queries: Query 1: get all statement with CPU usage and from high CPU usage to low 

to skip external lock you need to comment or remove and to disable delay key write you need to add the following parameter 

Lets say the database we will be using called test, then we have to connect to the database first then create schema, example below 

using then usually will save all unsaved changes to the logs and drop old ones. there is a workaround for it: 

References: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Edit: I found the following article regarding the performance: The performance is a matter of debate between these two methods for stored procedures. As its name suggests, is itself a stored procedure, which stores in the system database. must require passing SQL strings to it thus, excepted to showing higher chances of caching, consequently leading to perform better when run for the second or later on times. In other words, its parametrized dynamic T-SQL encourages its reuse. Moreover sp_execute is supposed having higher chances for avoiding unnecessary compilation while executing a dynamic query over . But some experts take it as misleading as they think for both methods a plan will be cached. In fact, for the non-parametrized queries of shows the same characteristics as the later one. $URL$ 

you need to check and from the results based on those values you can execute the following commands from MySQL to set them: 

RDBMS (Relational database management system) : is using SQL (Structured Query Language) to define and manipulate data. and it is used for large and complex query handling. in-order to work with RDBMS you need to define a structure (schema, table, constraints, ...etc). as an example (out of a town in-order for the people to live together they need to speak the same language, have a infrastructure, laws,..etc NoSQL (Not only SQL "none relational database"): it is like a blog, you can store the data any way you like (some use a something like table called column oriented, document oriented, graph-base, KeyValue (one of the most common uses of keyValue to call data and store them in JSON file). as an example earth since there is no common structure to be used or a define language that all people speak, the way they build houses, and infrastructure is different but differences between one place and another doesn't effect other places. I found this image as an example in $URL$ it explain a the differences between RDBMS and NoSQL in another way. 

You can execute the following command to check if is used or note by executing the following command or the first command () will show you the active mysql service ID and the default file location, the other one will show you only the location of the file. As for the location my the file it can be anywhere as long as MySQL user can access it and the file has 644 permission level. 

if the datafile is completely empty, then you have one of the two option: 1) reboot the database ( sometime it help) 2) move all the data from one to another one, then drop the and rename the new one 

increase memory for MySQL. at least by double memory value to test if the new memory that reserved to MySQL is enough. reformat the transaction to take less memory. 

I strongly recommend not to enable "Auto shrink" feature. since it will cause the following harm: 1) take a lot of resources on file system will level start fragmentation and other tasks. as well as high CPU usage and I/O since since it will start pagination. 2) its not controllable. 3) it may harm your database index. 

you can follow the tutorial in this link in-order to use PostgreSQL under C# and .net framework $URL$ for managing the database side you can use (in my opinion one of the best database management for PostgreSQL check the following link $URL$ $URL$ or EMS $URL$ . those database management program will help you a lot if you want to make the management of the database using GUI (easier to use than terminal screen) 

My question here can I make a rule for the three user when they created a database should start with their name ( if user3 create a database the database will have as prefix) or to add it automatically. 

there is two solutions for this: 1- install Oracle as administrator 2- create a folder in C or E drive then right click it, go to security tab, and change permission for the user (grant him owner access on that folder) 

for the query monitoring you have two solutions from MySQL level: solution 1: create log file for the query by editing or 

Edit to answer the comment below To shutdown MySQL safely without killing the SID (or PID) you can use one of the following commands: 

I had this problem before, and after long investigation I found out sometimes MySQL can not resolve any issue related to by default, so I did the following: edited hosts file ( can be found under Linux , for Windows ) and added ip and for the client machine,in your example its 

I found answer to my question, the following script will list all MDF and LDF is not attached to the instance on all the server (Note: I do NOT claim ownership of this script, had to do small modification since its a very old script) 

Note MySQL 32 bit has limitation, you can not increase the memory to more than 1.8 to 2G. If MySQl version is 64 bit then you will have the following results 

I would go for option increase RAID desks since\if you are using one instance. since RIAD size id dynamic, can be increased any time you want, and you don't have to do any splitting. your options are" 

Choosing character set usually based on the environment, each set has pros and cons. for example if your system has mixed character I strongly recommend but even utf8 has many types. for example: is faster than but less accurate for sorting. and if you want to use specific language Czech for example then you need to make the character set to get full language function. I found the following URLs regarding encoding hope they will help: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ the following URL contains some examples about disk usage for character set: $URL$ 

port (3308) is located under 3.3.3.3 if I use the following command I will get the following result: 

4) check the master status to get the log id ** after finish configuration the server one M1 you need to move to server 2 M2 (the same thing you did for server one but you need to make sure to change the host names as needed): 5) edit the cnf file but make sure the server id it not the same as M1 

Now lets move to , inside this file you need to search for your database section (in your question orcl) replace it like the following (note you need to take a backup from this file before doing any changes): 

I am working on a project that combine multiple MySQL ports under the same port; each port has a shared databases with names (database name and tables), so I though of the following idea. if I created user1, user2, and user3, on the new machine and separate all user databases by adding prefix () to the database name `. example: port (3306) one is located under machine 1.1.1.1, if I use the following command I will get the following result: 

there is several methods to find the queries that cause high CPU usage, most common waies: Method 1: use build in SQL server report to find queries with high CPU time. 

there is a lot of options but choosing the right one is up to you, this is some of the options : 1) Adminer: $URL$ 2) DBeaver: $URL$ 3)DBVisualizer Free: $URL$ 4) sql developer (but you need to install the plugins first) : $URL$ 

Useful URLs: $URL$ $URL$ (this can be used as an exmaple) What are the differences between NoSQL and a traditional RDBMS? 

you need to make sure there is: 1) user created that has remote access for example user@'x.x.x.x' 2) there is a connection from the two machine ( they can ping each other for example or access each another by another method) the port is opened between the two machine 3) in there is blocking connection parameter like: or 4) the service is up and running when you try to connect from the other machine 

allows for statements to be parameterized, Therefore Itâ€™s more secure than EXEC in terms of SQL injection can leverage cached query plans, The TSQL string is built only one time, after that every time same query is called with , SQL Server retrieves the query plan from cache and reuses it. Temp tables created in EXEC can not use temp table caching mechanism. 

then save and close ( note Windows will require reboot before taking any effect), you may need to add the following parameters and\or . 

port (3307) is located under 2.2.2.2 if I use the following command I will get the following result: 

First of all lets check what both commands mean: : Executes a Transact-SQL statement or batch that can be reused many times, or one that has been built dynamically. The Transact-SQL statement or batch can contain embedded parameters. : Executes a command string or character string within a Transact-SQL batch, or one of the following modules: system stored procedure, user-defined stored procedure, CLR (common language runtime) stored procedure, scalar-valued user-defined function, or extended stored procedure. The EXECUTE statement can be used to send pass-through commands to linked servers. some of the main deferences: 

Error means: The connection between Client and Server process was broken. Possible causes and general troubleshooting: 

Make sure server is accessible from client side, easiest way to do it by using command to verify. There is a connection between host and server using a specific port, you can use command to verify. Enable the instance listener to be listening on an IP address not . Database is running 

Lest start with the advantage for Master-Master replication: allows data to be copied from either server to the other one, it adds redundancy and increases efficiency when dealing with accessing the data, high availability . Now about Disadvantage : cost ( instead of using one machine you will be using two machine with high speed connection). Requirements: two servers ( you can use one server but it is not recommended unless its for testing) How to setup: lets say you have machines one m1 with IP 1.1.1.1 and machine two m2 with IP 2.2.2.2 1) login to M1 you need to edit the file for it by adding or comment\un-comment the following:
