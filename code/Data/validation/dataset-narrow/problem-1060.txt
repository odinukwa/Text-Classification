I'm open to using Python or a Bash script to do this, however any other solutions would work as well. Is this possible to do? 

It is just a false positive, these kinds of false positives happen fairly often with anti-virus. I'd also suggest whitelisting the github folder. 

I'm wondering why this may be happening? Shouldn't it be breaking at every newline? For more detail of what is being done check out this chat. 

Same error when I try with imap. The dovecot wiki suggests trouble shooting for the issue, however I have already tried the fixes. I have the protocols added in the config, and I have the listen option set to . My config is below. I am not sure what is wrong? ## Dovecot configuration file 

I essentially want to run the command one using each url present in the text file. Is this possible with a shell script? 

I have 4000 rows in excel and I need to remove all text after the first period in each row in the column. For example I have something like the following: 

I am using a Bash shell on a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS server, and it seems that IFS=$'\n' is being treated as IFS='n'. Script in use: 

So I asked on an IRC channel and I was told that it is very likely the game is 16-bit, and since the PC it is being installed on is 64 bit it may not work. There are option likes using a virtual machine, however there is a problem with these solutions. I am trying to install this game for an older lady who used to play this game on her old computer and loves it. She would be very upset if she couldn't play it, however she is not at all good with computers, so the above solutions are not very user friendly. What options do I have here? Here PC is Windows 7, I am testing this on Windows 8. 

Okay, this game is from 1991 and maybe it will not run correctly on Windows 8, so I tried the compatibility mode and got the following error: 

I recently built a new computer and put the wrong installation of Windows on (32 bit), meaning I cannot use all of my RAM. I would like to upgrade to the 64 bit version, though I already have downloaded many programs and games which would total to around 30 GB give or take. I don't have the kind of data usage with my ISP to re-download this much data again, until next month (total GB will be higher as time goes on). I know there is Windows Easy Transfer, but it is not so much my data itself I'm worried about, it is more having to re-download and install a bunch of games and applications. Is it possible to perform an upgrade from 32 bit to 64 bit without this loss? 

I am trying to boot into chromium on a Raspberry Pi running debian. However on boot it goes to a full screen command line with no graphical display. I have in a script that starts up chromium on boot, however this fails to work as it there is no graphical environment started therefore it fails to start. Is there a way to boot Chrome on startup in a graphical environment. 

I want to use a Triton USB to VGA adapter that I have, however I am running Linux (Ubuntu) and their drivers page only shows support for Windows. The purpose of this is to get 3 screens. I already have two and another graphics card will not fit. I have tried to simply plug the device in and hope it works however it does not Is is possible to get this working on Linux, or not? 

After enabling TUN/TAP via my vps and then disabling (causing restarts to server as well), ZNC will no longer work. ZNC won't start on boot, or manually. Here are the errors: 

On my brothers keyboard a pipe character is being inserted whenever he uses the shift key. It is weird because the key itself still performs the normal function that shift performs and allows making capital letters however at the same time it inserts the pipe (|) character. The keyboard layout is a normal Canada (English) layout with a US input. I am quite confused what may be the problem here? This is on a Windows 8.1 machine. 

I am trying to download v3.5.1 on archive.org of Mah Jonng. I have no idea what is wrong with it but here is the error when I try to run it: 

I have a year old computer that keeps just showing a black screen. As in there is nothing being sent to the monitor. Upon taking out the CMOS battery to reset the bios it works again however it only lasts a day or so before the same black screen issue reoccurs. We have gotten a new CMOS battery and tried using that as well to see if the battery is dead however it did not fix anything. At this point I am wondering what may be wrong? 

Right on the edge of the omnibar you can grab it and expand or shrink the size of the extensions area. The edge I am referring to is right to the right of the bookmark star, or in your layout it looks like it would be to the left of the star. 

Connections are refused on my server. Note: I am trying to connect from localhost here. Command I'm trying to use to test: 

When playing games or streaming videos I experience a spike that happens at least once or so a minute. I just almost completely lose any speed I just had, and after a few seconds it goes back up. Other devices on my network experience no connectivity issues. Via both wireless and wired connections I not experience any issues. Only on one computer are their issues. I've tried two different wireless adapters for the computer, both of which experienced the same issues despite working fine on other computers. The computer in discussion is a custom built computer. Is there anyway to diagnos what is causing the problem here? Could it be some hardware problem causing the issue, or is it something else? I don't know how to troubleshoot such a problem once I've eliminated the possibility that the network or connection device is not at fault. 

When using the up or down issue I sometimes get an issue where some of the previous commands text appears in front of my actually typing. It does not affect anything when I hit enter but it is very annoying having text appear at the beginning that appears to go with the rest. Any idea what is going wrong? 

I would like to host some videos on a site for a small audience (under 50 people), and don't want to use a site like YouTube or Vimeo, however I would like to have the same kind of load speeds for the videos. In my experience when I put up a 720p video with some h.264 compression there is still some people experience poor loading. Is there a simple solution to provide an option like YouTube has with quality selectors? Obviously I could render multiple versions and upload those, but that seems wasteful. Is there an optimal way to achieve this? Currently what I am using is videojs to display the videos which uses Javascript and HTML5 to display and show the video. The video I am showing using videojs is a 720p video rendered with h.264 compression. From YouTube viewing the video in 720p quality is no problem for loading, however from my site there are many times when you must wait for buffering. It has nothing to do with the sites speed, it is plenty fast, however the users are essentially downloading the whole video file, which itself is still a 250mb which is a lot for a user on a slower connection to handle. 

Is there such an application to start a upload to YouTube at a specific time, and then shutdown the computer afterwards? I'd rather upload around 2am when no one on my network is trying to use the internet, though I'm not usually up that late, and I don't want to leave the computer running after the upload is complete. Is there an application to assist with this? 

The answers I was getting was not the complete answers I was looking for, so here is the solution I used: I found the streaming URL which used RTMP. I created a script that would be run via cronjob to start at 5pm and kill at 6pm. Here is the script I made: 

Two of my extensions Lastpass and Checker Plus for Gmail have grayed icons and upon clicking them the pop up box does not want to display. The extensions have no problems at work (running Ubuntu) and my laptop (Ubuntu) also has no issues, however my home desktop computer (Windows 8) has only recently had this issue. I'm not sure how to go about debugging this to find out what the core problem is here. I have taken the standard steps of restarting the browser. 

This may sound weird, but every time I boot up my computer I need to hit CTRL-ALT-DEL and open task manager otherwise I am unable to interact with Windows. I can't click buttons, hit the start button, hit task bar icons, nothing, yet Windows appears to be operating fine (not frozen, startup programs still popping up). It does not seem like any weird OS issue as I have had the problem when trying Windows 8.1, Windows 8, as well as going down and trying Windows 7 32 bit, and Windows 7 64 bit. It seems to become a problem after installing Windows updates which includes some driver updates. I think it may have to do with the Razer updates for my Razer keyboard and mouse. One of the Windows updates includes adding the Razer Synapse program and likely also updates drivers related to it. What exactly is going wrong here? It doesn't make sense how opening task manager fixes the problem. It is getting annoying to have to do this on every boot up. 

Everyday I have about 10 different mp3 files created on my server. What I would like to do is setup a cronjob to run at night and combine the current days tracks into one mp3 track. I don't care so much about the ID3 info, though if such a method has the capability to merge these, then that would be ideal. Keeping it simple here is what I need to do: 

I am having some odd issues with my brothers computer. There were issues with the screen not getting any input, but the computer would be starting up fine, no beeps or anything. I attempted using different screens and cables and still was no signal. The computer did used to work fine, just one day after waking from sleep mode stopped sending a signal. I tried replacing the CMOS battery and this did not fix the issue. Using the Intel HD graphics through the motherboard work (VGA plugged into MB instead of Graphics card). However plugging into the graphics card it does not work. The odd thing is that if you fiddle around swapping the ports and turning it on and off eventually after many attempts there will be input again when plugged in via the Graphics card. And it all works fine... until a reboot or waking from sleep mode, in which case there is no signal again. I have also tried totally replacing the graphics card with a brand new one, still the exact same issue as before. I am unclear at this point what I can still test to figure out the problem. I have tested cables, screens, cmos battery, resetting cmos, reflashing cmos/bios, and even replacing the graphics card. What else could be tested here? 

I essentially want to have different environments set up such as a profile for general browsing with personal bookmarks, a work profile, and one profile for every clients websites I work on. The problem I am finding is that I cannot use a Google Account for more than one profile. This means I can't have all my profiles synced with my other browsers which is a problem as sometimes I would need my work profile at home, or my personal profile at work. Is there any workaround to be able to get this setup? 

I want all the ones formatted like this to turn out to just be . Therefore I want to eliminate the period and anything after it, while keeping the text before it. 

I want to setup a Ubuntu install on a virtualbox and then use this later to install onto a machine. I know I can create clones of partitions using something like Clonezilla, but is something similar possible when using a Virtualbox? I am not opposed to using VMware if it has such a function. 

There is a radio station I listen to which plays some remixed dance music songs at a specific time each day however I am not always able to tune in everyday at those times to listen, however I quite enjoy them and want to listen to them later. There is a stream online from the station, and I'm wondering if is possible to start an audio recording at a specific time everyday for a specific length of time? For my particular case I am referring to the following stream: $URL$ Is it possible to start recording at 5pm for an hour (so it would stop recording at 6pm) ? I'm looking to do this from the command line on a linux based machine (on my server). 

Is there a way to find out who added me to a large group chat on Skype? I keep getting added to a large conversation with around 45 people and I can't figure out who it is as I have added many people throughout my years of playing video games and have no idea who it could be. Is there any way to identify who is adding me so that I can remove them from my friend list? 

For Valentines day I get to pick the movie we watch for the night and I want to add a little something cute to the end of the movie. Just a brief bit of audio saying like a sentence. Is there an easy way to splice in a brief but of audio? I will need to add it before the credits hit, or just cut out the credits (credits don't matter to us). I know I can simply load the movie up in a video editor, add the audio in the spot I want and then render out the movie, but seeing as it is a full sized 1080p movie that could be a lengthy render time.
