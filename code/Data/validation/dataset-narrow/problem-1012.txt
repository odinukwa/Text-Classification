I have a text file containing a memory dump from an embedded system, which I update after every run (the file is formatted in the Motorola SREC format, but this is not too important). I am using Excel to parse the file to meaningful values and verify the results. Currently, I open the file in a text editor, select all, copy, then paste into a specified area in the spreadsheet. The formulas in the spreadsheet take care of the rest. I want to skip the stage of the text editor. What I would like to have is a way to embed (or, more correctly, link) the file contents in the specified cell(s), and let Excel update the fields automatically when the dump file changes (or, at least, update upon a key-press). Is there a way to do that? Note: I know it can also be done with //, but this is not an automatic process either. 

It appears that the Chrome settings allow you to open an "Advanced" mode settings page. There, there is a section for handling downloads and where you can check the box telling it to ask the user before every download. 

(For completeness of the previous answers) As the previous posters noted, the notation makes the reference absolute under cell copy. Note that you can make the reference row coordinate and the column coordinate fixed independently, like $RC or R$C. In order to streamline the -ify reference process while writing the formula, use the function key after selecting that cell. Cycling through the modes using F4 on, say, A10 reference, will change it to: $A$10 -> A$10 -> $A10 -> A10. 

Is there a way for running a shell script with echoing the commands but w/o actually executing them? Let's say I have script removing a file whose name is stored in a variable: 

Using Eclipse Indigo on Ubuntu 10.04. Every once in a while, I get the "Usage Data Upload" dialog popping up. Clicking on "Cancel" closes the dialog but it pops again after a while. I tried the "Turn UDC feature Off" selection followed by clicking "Finish", but again it pops after a while. I then tried the same selection with "Next>". It goes to "Terms of Use" tab, and when I confirm, it gets to the "Upload Preview" pane. How can I eliminate this dialog for once and for all? 

In the office we have a Canon MF4570dn printer connected through a switch to the LAN. At the same switch there is a computer running Vista which regularly prints to this printer. In the past, I was able to configure my Win 7 Printers and Faxes control panel to see this printer. I can see its properties pane and when entering its IP address, I can browse the printer's "Remote UI" management interface in the browser. However, I cannot set this printer as the default printer, nor can I print a test page from the control panel. Additionally, I don't see this printer in the available printers list in the Print... menus of the various applications. In the context sensitive menu for this printer in Control Panel, I see the Troubleshoot entry. But, when selecting it, I get the message that "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem." How can I use this printer for printing over the network? 

MS Excel provides a set of functions to work with complex numbers. When displaying real numbers, one can set the decimal places precision from the Format Cells dialog. However, it does not work for complex numbers. How can I set the displayed precision of a complex number? Is there a custom template I can use for that? --> 

where is the comm object that was defined. While running the script, a terminal (command) window is opened where some messages are echoed, including my print() messages. When the script ends, the terminal waits for a key press to close and return control to the IDE. How should I finish my script so that the terminal closes automatically? 

Now I really like the Highlight Search feature of Vim, b/c once I do the search, all the matching instances pop out in yellow color. Is there a way to assign different colors to different terms in the search string? That is, all matches of be yellow and of be green? 

Is it possible to change the default button to instead of , so a single press on Enter reloads the file? I am aware of the option, but I still want to be able to control the update. 

How should I set up a public key connection form Win 7 to Linux? How do I use this with (rather than PuTTY's ssh)? 

Is there a way to enable ClearType font rendering in Firefox tabs, regardless of the O/S settings? Some pages look awful on FF, while look much better in Internet Explorer. My understanding is that MS decoupled the ClearType definition of IE from the O/S. I'd like the same on FF. 

When this line (sans the ) is added in a (and the as well) file, the following appears when a new gVim is opened: 

Now, I want to see the flow of this script w/o actually removing the file. IOW, I want to prevent any effect on the external environment and filesystem. Is this possible? I could wrap all commands with an command, but it is tiring for a long script. 

I received a docx document that was edited with change-tracking enabled. Opening it for viewing with Word 2010 Starter, I see the changes in their bubbles. According to the help, in this edition I cannot turn the change tracking on or off. But, can I turn the tracking preview off? 

In order to automatically close the Debug Output Window, open: -> -> -> and uncheck the and checkboxes. UPDATE: I don't know why, but this only works sometimes??! 

I don't know what was the problem, but I downloaded the driver software from Canon's website and went through the installation process again. Now everything works as expected. 

I am using FireFTP 2.0.21 plugin on Firefox 32.0.3 to transfer files from PC to an Agilent E4438C Signal Generator. The instrument is connected via network switch to the PC. There is no problem browsing the remote directories and copying files around. However, when idle for some time (a few minutes), I start getting an error message repeatedly. The log console of FireFTP shows: 

My company made us all downgrade our laptops from Windows 7 to Windows 10. On my computer, I had to go through a full, clean installation, so I lost all my saved data (whatever was not copied to the "cloud"). As a part of the process, I had to reinstall Firefox afresh. Before the re-imaging, I backed up the Firefox profile on my older system, i.e., copied this folder to the backup: 

Using Firefox (v.27.0.1) to browse a news site, I have a problem of recurring ad pop-up windows, originating from a specific website (amazing-offers.co.il). The ad pops-up when the news page is loaded, and then every couple of minutes when it automatically refreshes itself. It is very annoying. I would like to block this pop-up from opening. Trying the Adblock Plus preferences, adding a filter in a new custom group, prevents the contents of the ad from displaying, but not its window from popping up. It appears that he Firefox's "Block pop-up windows" UI setting does not prevent this pop-up. Is there a way to prevent this window, from this ad server, from repeatedly opening without eliminating all other pop-ups? 

Update: I looked at the WinMerge bug tracker and found this report $URL$ from 2008, which is still open! 

I have a Win 7 Latitude E6530, which includes a discrete graphics card (nVidia MVS 5200M), normally connected via the Port Replicator to 2 external monitors (Dell U2410 + Dell 2001FP) both via DVI. In the past I could use the 3 monitors (2 externals and the built in) in an extended desktop configuration. I vaguely remember that the control panel display applet indicated that the active display adapter was the Intel Graphics one. A couple of months ago, after removing the laptop from the dock for the first time after a long period, something happened, and I can no longer use 3 monitors. The control panel says I now use the MVS 5200M card as the active adapter, and it is limited to 2 monitors (choose 2 out of the 3). I could not find where I can restore the old setup. Is there some configuration dialog that I missed?
