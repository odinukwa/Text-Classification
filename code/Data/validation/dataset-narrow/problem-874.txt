Does anyone know of a tool to open a packet capture saved as a .bin file? That or how to convert it to pcap or something wireshark can open. I took a packet capture from a thin client and when I download it its a .bin file type. I have not been able to find out who to open it to view it. 

I have exchange 2010. If I go to $URL$ and send an email by entering an email address that exists on my exchange server in the "from" box and send it to my gmail address, My exchange server goes ahead and sends the email.

I'm trying to authenticate specific LDAP group with FreeRadius. I need to apply this checking inside a virtual-server, as there are two different groups and i'm using a single Unix Box. Any suggestions of how to do this!.

We are using Elastix as an eFax system, the issue is that when trying to send Arabic text it appeas as "????". The issue appears to be in converting the text to postscript, Elastix uses HylaFax as virtual Fax and Hylafax uses: 

An internet provider installed us a microwave link: The issue is that: The ping from our side to the gateway is about 1-2 ms, which is great, but it remains like this for only 12 hours, then it start to give latency and time outs 100 - 800 ms. The provider changes only the channel and the ping reduces to 1-2 ms, i asked them after they changed the frequency channel to go back to the old channel to check if it's a noise issue or not, apparently as expected thing remained 1-2 ms. We have been in this case for two days. Any one has an idea of what could cause this issue ? or had this issue before. Thanks, 

I am having trouble running my command to create a file screen for each drive that contains a share. I have to run this on a lot of servers, any ideas? Here is where i am at now: I can create a file screen if i manually enter the path in this first line. But I need to automate that, each serer will have different shares. 

If I use this spoofing website to send an internal email, lets say from my co-worker to myself it arrives safely in my inbox. I have looked through my send and receive connectors and cannot find a way to stop this. 

Unless someone has blocked outbound/destination ports to (specifically 8530) your clients should not have any problems checking for updates from your WSUS server. You may inadvertently be blocking the client connections on the WSUS server itself. Even if by default port 8530 is open, I would verify by testing the WSUS server for port 8530. You can use Putty or another telnet emulator to connect via telnet, just change the telnet port to 8530. If the connection is successful then and clients are unable to connect to and get updates from WSUS then you have other problems. Give this link a try WSUS Troubleshooting. 

try to use iptraf and monitor the interface to check what are the source ip and port that are used to access privoxy, Most probably you are accessing it with different source ip range or single ip. you will be sure by using iptraf. to download it: 

And you don't need iproute2 or mangle table. The order of the rules matter, so please them before a matching drop rule 

Yes sure, With raid 0 you will: Enhance performance as blocks are striped. For both read and write operations. You will not gain any redundancy with this raid. 

Assuming the table name is NewLink ip rule add from 172.20.1.2 table NewLink Use ip rule add add group of users to the new connection: 

I have done the same scenario in the last two weeks, 1- i installed two virtual machines, used virtual Box 2- Configured the first one as openvpn server, and the second client. 3- Used private ips, why do you need to test on public ips it will make no difference, the only issue that you might face when moving to the real world is that the service provider has blocked some ports, just let them allow these ports. 4- it would be much better if you used the same service provider on the two sites if that is possible. now things are fine on the two sites ... 

I had to create an account at the teradici website, their website just says its in binary format, but they do provide a script in python to convert it to a pcap. KB2484. The script says i'm not allowed to post publicly so I wont do that. Link 

I have this foreach statement that goes through a list of usernames and puts each name in the path listed below, then it copies and pastes a file to the individual users startup folder. For some reason i get an error that a portion of the path was not found. Any ideas what the problem could be? 

I have a cisco asa 5505. The outside and inside IPs are private IPs so I do not want to NAT the inside IPs as they go out the Outside interface (there is a router upstream of the ASA 5505. Would I do static NATs? Or how would I pass traffic from the inside to the outside (like on a ping) without NATing the IP? Outside e0/0 VLAN 1000 IP: 192.168.0.6 255.255.255.248 Inside e0/1 VLAN 2 IP: 192.168.0.230 255.255.255.252 (this int has a Router downstream that i want to telnet into from the Internet 192.168.0.229/30) The Upstream router will have a 1:1 Nat mapping a public IP to the ip of the router downstream of the ASA5505. 

then start the named service. Below there is a good guide, you just need to setup the master dns part. 

or replace 8.8.8.8 with your own dns server, if you want to use private or local dns records otherwise it's prefered to you public dns and not to direct the dns traffic via the VPN tunnel. cause this will affect normal internet access once you are connected. You might need to reconsider the 

The above command will display list of available versions for this package. Then select the needed version and do the following. 

Yes it's possible: you need to do the following: 1- Install openvpn server on the public instance. Configure the openvpn server to send routes or ip range of your private instance. 

just solved it, seems to be a routing issue, just marked the packets destined to that port the with ip-rules added them to the desired table.. 

I have a powershell script to capture a screenshot. If Run it in powershell or ISE it runs fine, takes the screen capture without issues. When I schedule a task on windows Task Scheduler it just saves a blank image instead of the screen capture. Any ideas why? Script:

I have a file screen configured with a notification to write an event to the event log. I also want to configure that same file screen, using power shell, to run a power shell script.

Use online tool to check open ports, $URL$ Are you sure that is the public ip, cause i know 169.x.x.x is assigned when the device fails to obtain dynamic ip from the dhcp server ?? 

Allow traffic from the VPN traffic to the Private instance, using iptables. 2- Create one or move vpn clients and enjoy your direct connection. If you need any details of the above i'll be glad to help. 

You can list all available versions of a package and install the desired one or latest: You need to do the following: 

if you are using windows as client side, i would suggest to netlimiter software as it's easy to use, the tc is hard to configure specially in case of download as you would use polycer shaper. with netlimeter you can control upload and download speed easily, from the client side. 

But when I create an action to run my power shell script I cannot figure out how to add it to the template, or just a file screen. This is what I am using currently, how do i apply it to a template or file screen? 

I know this question is old but it helped me get to the correct solution. I solved this problem by ensuring i had the corresponding adml language file in the en-us folder. I would make sure you have the terminalserver.admx in your policydefinitions folder. 

I have a Domain Controller that for some reason beyond me has ADCS installed on it. The domain controller is a 2008 R2 server and needs to be demoted, but first I need to do one of two things. This same server also runs DHCP, NPS (RADIUS server),and other third party software. My Options (according to me) 1. Migrate ADCS to a different server (it would be a new machine with 2012 R2). $URL$ 2. Spin up an offline non-domain joined root CA and have a live domain joined issuing CA. I would then backup ADCS on the domain controller, revoke any issued certificates and remove the server roles. It would seem that for option 1 to work i need to migrate the computer name and IP as well. If I go with option 2, what steps can I take to mitigate the possible impact. Currently the CA has issued 9 certificates. However, only 3 have not expired, 2 of those expire in the coming week, the third one a year from now. What would be the best way to get ADCS off this domain controller?
