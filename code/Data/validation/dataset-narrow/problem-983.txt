The manual way To find out what they do, I recommend you take a look at the -location in the registry, located at: 

Adding that I'm certain there a fair few other variables that will impact it, but I'm not certain if permissions and such will. 

Understand what frequencies of RAM your motherboard supports Get a recommended setup for how you should distribute your RAM among the slots 

3. What is the relationship between SMB and NetBIOS; are they seperate, does one rely upon the other? SMB does rely on NetBIOS for communication with devices that do not support direct hosting of SMB over TCP/IP. NetBIOS is completely independent from SMB. It is an API that SMB, and other technologies can use, so NetBIOS has no dependency to SMB. NetBIOS (Network Basic System) 

Unfortunately, this is a"no" answer, per the comment to the question: this is not possible to modify. Your best bet is to create a bug, or submit your own patch. 

Click , click , type in the Open box, and then click . Click the following registry hive: On the , click . If is not listed in the Group or user names list, click , make sure that the local computer name appears in the box, type in the box, click , and then click .

Then, if you want to avoid doing this every time after rebooting, append the following line to your file. If it's not there, create it. 

As far as I am aware, nothing in particular. My guess is that this will be hard to answer without further debugging. If your printer uses UPnP, it is likely that it has some sort of feature where you can connect to your printer from outside your network. Basically, it sets up port forwarding by communicating with your router via a standard for this sort of negotiation between networked devices. Provided you only use your printer on your local network, I see no reason this should negatively impact you in any way. In fact, some might claim having UPnP disabled would be for the better, as your printer would not be reachable from WAN. 

Launch via Windows + R. Navigate to Computer Configuration / Administrative Templates / Windows Components / SkyDrive. Open up "Prevent the usage of SkyDrive for file storage", as shown underneath. 

The KB-0316 comes with a PS/2 connector--which is purple, as you noted, I believe--that should work provided you have a a PS/2 to USB adapter. 

Create a user environment variable named and set it to the folder you want chocolatey to install to prior to installation. Create the folder manually. Install Chocolatey. 

I would recommend that you read the manual for your motherboard. This is mainly because that way, you can.. 

Unfortunately, no. Your best bet is to add an additional context menu item that points to a different piece of software, that does allow you to run it in the background. Alternatively you could do something similar that points to a AutoHotkey script or similar, that will press Background for you. Help pages for "Command line syntax" for WinRAR 

This appears to be because it's no longer available in Windows 7, as it is no longer available post-XP. 

Log on to your computer as an administrator. Click , and then click . In the Open box, type , and then click . At the command prompt, , and then press Enter. Type , and then press Enter. Verify that the account has full control access permissions to the hive in the Windows registry. In some cases, you may also have to add Administrator accounts. 

As far as I can find, there is no reason why this should happen. Check that whatever method you use for minimizing the window does not collide with another hotkey, button, method or similar activity that would result in the virtual machine being paused. 

It's a bit strange that you have three startup items for reg.exe, so I'd check out the registry keys and see what parameters the instances for have. 

You're better off using a more permanent solution to the issue, by say, using PowerShell to get a list of download items and then send this to whatever download manager you want to use. 

Folder Lock FAQ, encryption section, question 7. In other words, you cannot retrieve the contents of your locker if you've lost the password. 

All of which are related to touch interaction. In short, unless you're going to be testing touch features and implementations, you should go with Windows 7. slhck makes a good point though, if you don't have any reasons beyond Internet Explorer, you might as well not get any version of Windows. 

What you are looking at is a DisplayPort connector. It's a pretty good replacement for what we in many cases use VGA and DVI for. 

Basically, depending on what features you use, the configurations you can employ will wary. To repeat regarding your question, I don't have accurate information on whether or not it could be, but whenever you're using CrossFireX or SLI, it is not possible to connect your displays to your secondary card, basically. 

Not without a motherboard specifically with such a feature, which I at the very least don't know about. Though, you could always try to resolder the circuits for it on the motherboard. Personaly, I've never heard of a motherboard with that, nor did l find any online. 

Well, I recommend you install PowerShell on... whatever device you run this from, and you might be happy with the results. 

Let's try to go through this as a journey where you and I both stand to learn how this works! 1. Are both services necessary? If not, are there any benefits over running a single service? Depending on your operating system and environment, both services are not necessary. SMB (Server Message Block) 

By jumping the two pings, 5 and 6, you limit the transfer rate to 1.5 GB/s. PHY is simply the physical layer in question, between the drive and cables/transfer. Take a look at Wikipedia's page on SATA throughput. 

Regarding point 2, I don't think it's as relevant considering you've filled all your slots, but checking that your frequencies are equal among sticks would--if I recall correctly--be a good idea. 

Measuring the performance gain from defragmentation is rather difficult, however there are some utilities that are meant to "aid" you with it. There's the utility called File Access Timer, from Raxco, available here. This tool will read a certain file/folder a set amount of times and display how long it took, along with the fragments. Excerpt from the readme 

Your motherboard might be configured to accept any direct network traffic, as opppsed to what is known as the "Magic Packet". In that state of configuration, your motherboard will accept any metwork traffic, instead of this particular packet used for waking your computer off. The solution in this case would be to change what wakes it up, which on a Windows system would most likely be done from the settings for the network device. 

On Windows, SMB can run directly over TCP/IP without the need for NetBIOS over TCP/IP. This will use, as you point out, port . Generally speaking, on other systems, you'll find services and applications using port . This, basically speaking, means that SMB is running with NetBIOS over TCP/IP, where, stack-wise, SMB is on top of NetBIOS if you are to imagine it with the OSI model. Here's a visualization from Richard Sharpe, from samba.org. 

This information was taken from the "The Windows Installer Service Could Not Be Accessed" error message when you install a program in Windows XP-article. 

There's no noticeable difference, although in some cases with, say SLI, you'll be forced to setup a certain configuration of connected displays to actually use said technologies. For instance, with SLI (and CrossFireX), and a seperate-displays configuration, you connect your monitors to one card. That one card can be considered the "master", whilst the other card will participate in the rendering of frames and calculations - like PhysX-related computations. It is worthwhile to mention a few of the typical requirements here: 

The best way is to disable the driver, that way you don't have to undo any hardware changes in the future. Open up a terminal and enter the following: 

To establish if you are using CrossFire, you should be able to do this from within the Catalyst Control Center, as you state yourself. Without that, you can safely assume that CrossFire isn't available at the moment, regardless of why. 

Since you plan to use the option Keep files and applications, thus an in-place upgrade, you should not lose any of your application data associated with that user. However, you could recommend that your friend signs in with her Google account, as to synchronize these forms. That way, even if the upgrade fails, you'll still have your data. Otherwise, you can also per the other answer simply copy your user data folder. 

I would recommend trying their upcoming 2010 version and see if that works around the issue at hand. $URL$ 

Short answer: you can't in a proper way at the moment. However, you can get partially "rid" of it - note the quotes! Disabling SkyDrive entirely via local GPO This option requires that step one works; if not, go to the registry editor method.
