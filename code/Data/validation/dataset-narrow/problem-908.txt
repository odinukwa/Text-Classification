FINAL SOLUTION Just to clarify, my mistake was that I set the password for the wrong user, I tried to set it for root whereas I should have set it for ubuntu with: 

Can I just copy these to a location on the new server and reference them in the NGINX configuration file? Or do I need to generate a new ssl key, re-key the crt file(which one)? 2. NGINX CONFIGURATION The NGINX configuration only seems to need reference to two files Apache does? 

Got it working I had to replace the /etc/nginx directory with a backup I took of it before I tried anything with ngx-pagespeed. Now it works as before but pity ngx-pagespeed did not work. 

I had one nginx configuration set up and working fine in . Today I've tried to add another for the sendy email marketing app based on this configuration. After running the command failed I checked online and found that should highlight any sytax errors, it gave the following result. 

Most likely the library's network server for wifi access requires a CA Certificate to validate authentication with the RADIUS server. Recommend you: 

It sounds like you placed your Rewrite directive in your site's httpd.conf apache file. This file is only parsed one time on service boot/reload. If you place the Rewrite directive in the site's .htaccess it'll get hit every time something is called, and thus reflect the latest mime type from your script. To do this, be sure to: 

Make sure the apache httpd.conf or equivalent file allows for htaccess overrides. Confirm whether you want to modify headers early or late in the request. See $URL$ Add the Rewrite block to an .htaccess file in your webserver's root directory. Run your htaccess file through a checker to make sure it's valid. (you could use a tool like $URL$ Run your updated httpd.conf or equivalent file through an apache config checker (such as the command noted in Command to check validity of Apache server config files) 

I was getting 403 & 404 errors on a Magento application I was working on I tracked down the issue to two blocks in the NGINX configuration, if I comment them out the issues are resolved but I would like to understand better what I'm commenting out. ISSUE 1 I was getting a 403 error on URLs such as 

I thought, maybe I added the public key to the on the server incorrectly. She sent me a public key like this called 

Which CRT file should I reference for NGINX, what about the other one? 3. SSL 3.0 & SHA1 When I check our site on DigiCert's SSL checker it says: 

We're swicthing from an OSCommerce website to Magento and are also swicthing servers. The old server is on Apache and our new one is on NGINX. The SSL certificate we have seems to have been purchased from GODADDY. I've almost figured out how to switch our SSL certifcate from our old server to our new server. But have a few questions? 1. REKEY CERTIFICATE I've discovered three types of SSL files from the old OSCommerce site apache virtual host: 

Your Apache settings are all accurate; your issue is most likely a result of the domain being saved in the Wordpress database. By default, Wordpress stores the base url in the wp_options table for both the homepage and site url. In addition, it stores the fully qualified domain in all the individual post/page GUIDs in the wp_posts table. Options to find & replace the domain: 

apply any available security updates to your Ubuntu installation, to make sure you've installed the latest patches for the openSSL vulnerabilities identified at the beginning of the year (refer to $URL$ Check to make sure your ubuntu network settings are using auto proxy and not a manually configured one. install the generic security certificates and follow steps similar to those outlines for Ubuntu users trying to connect to the University of Michigan's wifi network (which has a similar setup): $URL$ 

mod_rewrite is now fully enabled. Now you can setup an .htaccess file to define rewrite rules for redirects. 

Ok was the error log was totally throwing me off, and had nothing to do with the underlying issue. The issue was caused by Magento & HHVM not working well together. In the end I solved it simply by adding the following to my /etc/hhvm/server.ini file. 

The issue with this now is that my file is now accessible. How can I rewrite this block better? What does mean? ISSUE 2 I was getting a 404 error on URLs such as: 

We have a magento store which appends a query to our URL when you change Magento store views on the frontend. i.e. $URL$ Is there a way to remove the ?___store=uken with NGINX configuration? Say remove any query beginning with ?___store=. I'm very new to server config & nginx in particular. 

Our webserver is on AWS running on Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS. When I ssh into the server I see this message. 

Now I'm asked for a password but the one which I set does not work! Luckily I created an AMI before I started any of this. Could the issue be that I don't have a password set for the user, I should I have run rather than . 

This will activate the module or alert you that the module is already enabled. To put these changes into effect, restart Apache. 

And in the case you want to doublecheck/test and debug your regular expressions, use a tool like $URL$ 

HTTP_CONTENT_LENGTH is specific to IIS, and in fact returns the raw value of the CONTENT_LENGTH header. (CONTENT_LENGTH is available on all server environments). For reference, this Visual COBOL documentation Server Variable's Reference page lists this and many other IIS specific variables. $URL$ 

The number of directives definitely impacts webserver performance and thus page load time. As you noted, performance-wise, placing such directives in the httpd.conf is preferred since those directives are parsed one time while .htaccess directives are processed for every request to that directory or a child item within a subdirectory. The performance difference is usually negligible (milliseconds) for many small websites. However, if your site has a lot of traffic, or for that matter, is on a shared webserver with several other sites which aggregate to heavy usage/volume, then the performance degradation can definitely be more observable. There's no defined "recommended number" of directives, but a good rule of thumb for a shared hosting environment is to only add the directives you absolutely need to .htaccess. Your hosting provider's cpanel may often include webserver application configuration options at the httpd.conf level for things like: 

I discovered if I changed the name of this file to I stopped getting the 404 error on it, and when I removed the below block from NGINX it loaded fine with it's origional name, so it must of had something to do with the dots at the end of the file name. 

And then updating /etc/sudoers so that the ubuntu user must give their password when running a command. To edit this file you must run and add: 

Which is odd as I'm not used to comments in public keys or line breaks? We've tried using her public key with & witout the comment & line breaks. I've added it to like this: 

We are running the site on Nginx & HHVM. I checked the /var/log/nginx/error.log and I see this error: 

Secondly when I removed the sendy-newsletter configuration from and folders, as expected I could restart the nginx server successfully but strangely when I ran I get the same error message as before but the server works!? 

Add your conditions and rules, be sure to indicate necessary flags on each rule. (Most commonly, apply no case sensitivity with NC). See Apache's RewriteRule flags documentation at $URL$ Test your updated .htaccess rewrite rules. Be wary- a single typo in the .htaccess could result in a 500 error. 

Connection method: your current setup might be creating new connections instead of reusing existing ones, thus maxing out the number of connections. To resolve: 

In your particular use case (switching from rules generated with the IIS URL Rewrite extension to straight Apache rewrites), you may want to check out some of these previous posts on stack overflow as examples:

On a related note, but only when a query is performed- MS Access 2010 handles looping through large tables differently than Access 2003. See $URL$ There are patches/service packs available for Office and Windows Server that may remedy some of these issues as noted in this KB post: $URL$ 

I suppose I could create an image of the webserver on AWS incase anything goes wrong. Is there a way I can check to see what the updates are, especially the security ones, so I can see how necessary they actually are? 

Also I tried running the syntax test after removing the configuration file I am not using $ sudo rm default-staging $ sudo rm ../sites-enabled/default-staging $ sudo nginx -c /etc/nginx/sites-available/sendy-newsletter -t nginx: [emerg] "server" directive is not allowed here in /etc/nginx/sites-available/sendy:1 nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-available/sendy test failed 

I'm trying to allow another developer to connect to a our ubuntu server and they are getting the below error in FileZilla. 

I'm moving a site to a new server running on NGINX. The old site's Apache2 VirtualHost has configured that I want to replicate in the NGINX configuration. From what I've read on the NGINX Docs this seems to be simply achieved with . I just want to make sure what I have is correct. From APACHE2
