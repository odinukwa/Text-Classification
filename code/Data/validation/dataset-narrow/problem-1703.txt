From here you can run any command to manipulate the image. Once finished setting it up how you want exit the chroot and do some cleanup: 

It sounds like what you are doing on the arduino is , converting the range from 0-1024 to 0-255 then using . What you are doing is converting a analog signal to a PWM signal. The function is badly named in the arduino sdk. It does not write an analog signal to a pin. Instead it sends a series of pulses, with varying width between them where 0 is fully off and 1 is full on. In some devices (such as leds) this mimics the effect of changing the voltage. Other devices such as servos and motor controllers actually expect a PWM signal to function correctly. There is no way without addition hardware for an arduino UNO to generate a true analog signal. Now, in electronics analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters convert a signal from a min to a max voltage in so many steps, 1024 in the case of the arduino ADC. Even if analogWrite produced a true analog signal, its range is 0-255, but the min and max voltage would still likely be the same - just with less resolution so all you are doing is lowering the resolution of the signal rather then reducing its voltage. Now, the pi has no ADC built into it so you need some sort of external ACD to read an analog signal, there are many such chips about and you can skip the arduino UNO entirely by using one, without having to worry about coding it at all - you can just worry about coding on the pi. Assuming you still want to use the arduino as a ADC you are going to need to talk to the pi over a protocol it understands. There are many of them to pick from: serial (UART), i2c or spi. WARNING: the arduino UNO is a 5v device dy default, its pins will read/write signale at 5v. The raspberry pi can only accept 3.3v MAX on a pin. Sending a 5v signal to it will damage the pi. You can use a logic level converter to shift from 5v to 3.3v. Alternatively, you can run the arduino off 3.3v (by supplying 3.3v to the pin label (and bypassing the 5v reg onboard) or by replacing the voltage reg with a 3.3v reg, at which point the pins will read/write 3.3v max. Serial is probably the easiest to get started with. You will want to change your sketch basically; then and finally a small to stop it overwhelming the serial line. From the pi you can read these values with any serial reading application (picocom, screen, minicom) on the device file: 

I need to test my computer vision stack written in C++ on a mobile robot and I need to control the robot from a Linux ARM board (which can be a Raspberry Pi). Since the specialized wheeled robot platforms are quite expensive (RobotShop lists few, usually chassis only without motor, steering servo etc.) and since I would like to use a normal 4-wheeled platform with steered front wheels I am thinking about using an ordinary ready-to-ride RC car. I am all new to both RC modelling and electronics hacking, could someone give an introduction of what I need to buy and do? Can I use a Himoto RTR car for instance? I inspected few of them, the most affordable ones seem to have the RC receiver and steering servo integrated into one piece (like this car) and I really do not know if that is an issue since I guess I will need to replace the RC receiver with the RPi... I need help with how to interface from the RPi to the car (motor + steering servo). I read about following: 

If you use auto-exposure and auto-gain (=ISO) then yes, the camera needs few frames to actually determine how to set these values. This is normal behavior - if you need correctly exposed frame you need to wait some time after camera initialization. I think both exposure time and ISO should be manually controllable via raspistill's command-line parameters and I also saw these settings in AVA's C++ raspicam library. 

Seems like servos and brushed motors use PPM while brushless motors use PWM. I am interested in both brushed (cheap) and brushless (good endurance) motors. Can someone suggest a hardware I need to use for both RC model part and RPi part? Do I need a special shield for RPi because of the motor/servo? On the software side, since my vision stack is in C++ the best would be to be able to control the RC car from C too (no Python etc.). I plan to use a gamepad with 2 joysticks to be able to control the car, either connected directly to USB on the RC car's RPi or on another RPi and using wifi transmission. I think I can deal with this gamepad part alone... just need help with the motor/servo stuff. Thanks for help in advance! 

Then they build a docker image with your application in it, and push that to your pi restarting the container all automatically. They even offer a local dev loop where you can build the docker image locally and push it directly to the pi. 

Note that you might find that the terminal window closes right after the last command finishes. If you want to keep it open you can add (depending on your terminal) or (depending on the terminal application you use). Alternative you can append to the end of the command to keep the terminal window open waiting for some input. This will work even if your terminal does not support an option to keep it open. 

Serial is just a way to send data (often text) between two devices bidirectionally. Operating systems generally expose the serial device to user space programs for them to use as they see fit. Under Linux they can be accessed through or or . Under Mac through or similar. And under windows it's called something like . The Raspberry Pi's serial device is at from the pi's perspecitive. By default it writes the startup logs and then attached a terminal (aka a getty) to the serial device which allows you to control the pi over the serial line from a pc. You can view and send commands to this terminal from your computer with a USB to serial adapter and a serial program like or (or one of many others) on Linux/Mac or on Windows. The baud rate that the getty uses is , this is the speed of the serial connection and must match on both sides of the serial line or you will just get corrupted data. This is nice for general access to the pi without a network connection but is not the best way to control the pi programmatically. Instead it is better to write your own program to listen on the serial port on the pi and do things when it receives messages on it. Disable the serial getty To do this we need to first turn off the getty and logs that are configured by default. You can do this on rasbian by following this guide. On the latest raspbian you can do this by running the following. Or on older versions follow this 

Since you have installed it using you need the correct permissions to remove it from the system too. 

and execute it using : This will trigger a new session called : MySession with windows juliaScript and pyScript 

This solution is based on the assumptions of your situation, and the best of my knowledge to help you solve it through 

What you need here is . Cron jobs are the standard thing when it comes to scheduling tasks at certain time or event instances. Simply type: 

It is a Multicast Address which will give your pings from the Pis which have the same ad-hoc parameters. This should most definitely give you the address of the Pi within the ad-hoc network. Networking upon next boot In best case use the following in your (both Pis) file: 

However if you want to compile the kernel on your own following the aforementioned Source link. The steps tend to be quite tedious, so it is good to perform it on a new SD card or make sure to back up the data from the old one. For building a Read-Only version follow the steps on this Source:2 

I am really not sure if you should be using really high . Yours is which is extremely high. Chances are that this signal might cause a lot of interference on the channel if there is some wireless activity going on. I suggest you reduce it something like this is an acceptable value. Also if you are using Edimax 7811UN adapters and using Raspbian Wheezy with versions less than 7.10/7.11 then there will definitely be an incompatibility issue, since the older Raspbian versions did cause a lot of problems when running the Edimax in ad-hoc mode. (I did some experiments and this was evident for me). However in Raspbian Jessie or Wheezy 7.10 and 7.11 this compatibility driver issue is resolved and the adapters work in ad-hoc mode If you are not receiving any DHCP offers chances are likely that your Pis are on two different frequencies of the spectrum. I strongly suggest creating a small bash function in your where you atleast set initial parameters the same. 

You need at least two pis. Each only has one HDMI port and can only run one os/display at a time. You effectively have three entities, the media server and two displays/thin clients. Raspberry pis can act as either a media server or a thin client (or both at once). So you can connect one pi to one display, have it run as a media server and client to that display and have the other pi connect to the first over the network and act just as a client. XBMC can act as both a server and client, so you just need to get a second pi connected to the second display to connect to the first one. Note however that the pi is not very fast at network/disk access and streaming two streams over it might prove too much for it. If you find performance to be a problem you can setup a central media server (on low end hardware, possibly with more disk space) to act as the media server (with XBMC) and the two pis to just act as clients. 

You are running out of memory and being hit by the OOM Killer in an attempt to stop your system crashing. The OOM Killer is a bit random, but is weighted by the amount of memory a process uses so if you see a lot of nginx worker processes being killed then they are likely responsible for the memory usage. You can use tools like , or (slightly nicer version of top) to see how much memory you are using and which applications are using most of it to help give you an idea of where the problems might be and if the changes you make are actually helping. Given that it is the nginx worker processes that are being killed how many do you have? I think by default it is the number of cores you have but it can be configured. Since the workers have their own memory pool the more works you have the more memory you will use. If you are using php-fpm you might want to look at the number of worker that uses as well as they share the same problem as the nginx workers. Raspberry pi images also don't come with swap space (but can be configured to have some) which can give you more effective memory before the OOM Killer kicks in. Swap space would be most useful if you occasionally spike in memory usage or have a lot of generally unused memory, otherwise it tends to hamper performance and can reduce the life of your sd card. 

I am interested in using a camera module that is said to use a serial LVDS-camera interface. I want to use the grayscale version (VM-010-BW-LVDS) of following camera product: VM-010: phyCAM-S camera module, WVGA monochrome The specs regarding data format say 8 bit serial, with Y8 interface-mode. I need to get the images from this camera to my C++ code with OpenCV. I want to use this specific camera because it has an external trigger and can directly output very low resolution which is what I need. May I ask someone to point me into the right direction where to begin with the camera? Or, rather than only pointing, I would very much appreciate an overview of a possible interface design with some notes for a very beginner in this field. I am a JavaScript developer and C++ is my hobby only so far. Thanks! 

If you want a simple solution that has a button on the transmitter and a LED/buzzer/speaker on the receiver you do not need a RPi at all. Just build a simple RF transmitter like this one: Simple RF Receiver / Transmitter Pair (27 MHz). Of course, If you want a more sophisticated action on the receiver side (like connect to LAN etc.) you can connect RPi to the 27 MHz receiver and read its signal via GPIO input on the Pi. 

I would like to build a long range (10s of kms) wireless link in the unlicensed spectrum (like amateur radio - maybe 27 MHz, ideally with variable frequency setting). The transfer speed requirement is at least 1kB/s (9600 bps). I have no experience with HAM radio or packet modems (TNCs etc.). 

Editing/Checking your Try adding in your file You can put in your You can also add the IP address of your Pi to your file viz. 

Hi I tried this Patch for Raspberry Pi 2. I have a Raspberry Pi 2 Model B and I followed the README manual and My WebIOPi actually works. This will definitely work according to my assumptions. NOTE : This will work for WebIOPi-0.7.1 on a Raspberry Pi-2 Model B with 1 GB RAM 

handle takes into consideration that will trigger once the Pi is rebooted. You can schedule tasks very 5 Minutes or every 12 hours or Sundays at 12:00. Here is a link which will help you with Cron Jobs on RPi If you are the programming geek type you can use schedule PyPi Module where you can schedule tasks by programming it. Note Since you mention that the Power supply may not be constant, chances are that your time on your Pi will start varying to your real time. Example, if today is Tuesday 12:00 PM and if you Pi was off for some time then the time on your Pi may vary Monday 14:00 PM in this case you can use your Network's NTP server to sync back the time or use an RTC module which maintains the time even when the Pi is switched off.

I have a self made Isolation Board which consists of 2 Relay Switches and provides a kind switching function to cut off the power supplied to a Sensor Device on the other side of this Board. The sensor device is battery operated and in common scenarios will take the power from the Raspberry Pi 2 via the Isolation Board. Current Specifications in general for Raspberry Pi-2 and the world standard for USB-2.0 is rated approximately . This creates a problem since the Sensor is battery operated and the ratings on it are . This means when the battery of the sensor is completely drained out and if I would like to get the Raspberry Pi to start charging it for me-
