This removes the data under key from the localStorage, and reloading the page may restore it to 'factory settings'. If you're not sure if the particular key is set by the cookie notification functionality, you may open the page in incognito mode, and list the contents of localStorage before and after interacting with the page. Again, I doubt too many sites use localStorage for this purpose. 

Let me add one more possibility here for future reference. If you are using the microSD card with full-size SD adapter, the adapter may be bad. This is especially common with cheaper cards, and these adapters may go bad pretty quickly too. (In my experience as little as 10 uses in the worst case.) The most reliable way to tell if the card is still good is to use a dedicated microSD reader, possibly a higher-quality one. A mobile phone that takes microSD card can also be used. I generally recommend using microSD readers for microSD cards. 

I didn't know that my google account wasn't in sync with my chrome for the last couple of months and now that I have link again, the restored record is several months old. Now, that I've lost all my recent bookmarks and all other stuff...is there anything or anyway so I could revert the Google sync so I can get my bookmarks back? Update 1 I have found that under there is a file named that holds the old state of my bookmarks before the sync. Update 2 is the file that holds the current(after sync) bookmark list. I replaced with and restarted chrome, but still chrome isn't fetching information from the updated file. So, I have my old bookmark information, but how to restore it in chrome. Update 3 : solved I still couldn't figure out why replacing the bookmarks file didn't work and aparently that's the only solution available on web. I reinstalled everything and then copied the old bookmarks file. Then I got my bookmarks back again. Lession learned : Check regularly if google sync is working. 

The identifies the value set by JavaScript on the page you are on. If you believe does something relevant, you can try removing it by running the following: 

I have a local network consisting of two virtual machines (for testing purposes). Both run Debians. I'll refer to them as A and B. My goal is to have A act as 'whole of Internet' for B (for HTTP requests on ports 80 and 443), such that using any domain name (even those that don't exist on the Itneretnet) return the response from the web server on A. I've installed a DHCP server on A, and made it use its own IP address as the DNS server address, and started a tool. On B, I can successfully connect to the first one and obtain the IP address as well as the nameserver address using DHCP. The is started with: 

You could probably use .netrc file (note: I havent't done this myself). You could either generate dynamically at runtime or have it sit there. EDIT: As long as your script has access to .netrc, so does the user that runs the script. So if you give the script to someone else and that someone else has access to the private key, it doesn't matter that you don't have the password hard-coded in the script. 

I have Windows 8 installed on one of my HDD and I want to install Linux Mint on my unused SSD. The point is, I want to install another operating system to the unused hard driver in a way, that it does't interfere with Windows 8 default boot sequence. My plan is to use the Boot Option Menu(pressing F12) at boot time to select desired HDD to get different OS running. I don't want Mint to implement a boot loader on my primary storage. The problem is, I am using Lenovo Ideapad Y500(UEFI firmware) and since it came with Windows 8 pre-installed, I am assuming there is some hardware binding with the OS. i.e. OEM SLP key (Original Equipment Manufacturer - System Locked Pre-installation), One key recovery feature etc etc. Question is, is there going to be any problem if I just boot from live Linux Mint and install it to my SSD and try to boot it using Boot menu? How I can install Linux Mint without interfering with Windows 8? I want to keep everything separate from the hardware level. Thanks! Edit : Since I am on Laptop I didn't find a way to disconnect/remove my primary HDD without opening it up and I don't want to do that. 

This did not produce the result I expected. Is what I'm trying generally a good approach? How do I make this work? EDIT: Added diagram kindly provided by Cont7e 

They asked you if you'd like to store preferences in cookies, not whether you'd like them to set cookies in general. So if I were writing support for this feature, I'd set a separate cookie (e.g., ) and check whether user has this cookie. There is a good chance you'll find such a cookie for that site, which you can clear without clearing other cookies or history. Inspecting cookies set for a particular page In Firefox, you can list cookies for a particular page by right-clicking a blank part of the page, then selecting View page info option. You'll find a "View Cookies" button in the "Security" tab. In Chrome, you have the same "View page info" option, which opens a dialog that hangs from the address bar. Link near the top will take you to a listing of cookies. I assume similar features can be found in other browsers. Discovering if site sets a cookie Here's one way you can discover what the site is doing. Open the site in Incognito mode. Open developer tools and switch to Network tab. Then check out what activity is happening in the background as you decline to have the site track you with cookies. Specifically, look for response headers and see if there are any 'Set-Cookie' headers in there. Then try deleting cookies mentioned in the header and see if that makes any difference. About localStorage Since another poster has mentioned localStorage (in-browser database), I'll comment on that as well. I think it'll be very rare that the site uses localStorage for this purpose as localStorage data isn't accessible to the server unless there is JavaScript code that sends the data back to server. If you wish to check the contents of the localStorage, the fastest way is to open the developer tools in your browser, go to (JavaScript) Console tab, and type . This should give you an output that looks something like: 

There was a sudden crash, Blue screen of death on my pc. But, after the memory dump on 20% the whole system turned off itself leaving only the power led on. After that I tried turning off and on again but there was no activity except all the cooling fan were running and the lit power led. There is nothing on the screen. There isnt even any beep sound. Where should I start troubleshooting my system? I dont have any second machine to try and replacing things. I think its a motherboard issue. Another thing is that, the BSoD was frequent now a days. But I didnt bother. Here is what happened 

Is it possible to monitor one program from/using another program. Say, I want to monitor the responsiveness of a program or how much memory/cpu that process in using when doing a particular job. Is this possible? I am not talking about monitoring task manager. I was looking for something more sophisticated method that could identify , what process or what subsystem is causing the ir-responsiveness for that program etc etc. OS: Windows 7. 

With the above two lines in sudoers (you can edit the suoders with command), user account named will be able to run without password: 

If your drive is failing as per Omar's suggestion, you should get another drive that is larger than the failing one (larger than 320GB + the size of the data you currently have on it) and burn a copy of SystemRescueCD or similar rescue system, and use a tool like ddrescue to copy the failing drive to the other one. It will generate an image file that you can later mount and copy files to the remaining space on the new larger drive. 

Apart from dig, no other tool (ping, curl, etc) will actually use the address, but instead they all complain that the hostname could not be resolved. What am I doing wrong and is this approach good? 

Windows 7 PC connects to the first one via WiFi, and to the second via Ethernet port. Another device connects to second router using Ethernet for now because I cannot get its WiFi working. I want to connect the second device to Internet somehow. I have installed a minimal OpenWRT install on the second router (not that I have any experience using it), and tried configuring the router to put one of the wlan interfaces into managed mode by editing its wireless configuration like so: 

My system : Core 2 Duo, 2GB DDR2, Intel G41, Radeon 4670, Windows 7 Solved :: It was a motherboard failure. 

I was working. BSoD shows up Display goes black while the memory dump was on 20%. Monitor power was up, its just there was nothing to display. There was nothing happening, like no hard disk activity. So, I cold restarted the system. Nothing shows up on the display. No hard disk activity. There even wasnt any beep sound. Tried restarting it several times. But the result remains the same. 

Information is conveyed by the change in values in a signal. High data rate is achieved by making higher frequency signals. If a link supported higher bandwidth, that means it supports high frequency transmission. Which translated to being able to transfer high frequency signal. This is how high bandwidth correlates to high capacity for a network link. Source 

I am reading a networking book and it says - to have a high capacity(bits per second) link, we need to have a high bandwidth link. And bandwidth is defined as the range of frequencies available for communication on that particular link. For example, voice grade phone line typically supports a frequency range from 300Hz to 3300Hz, so the bandwidth of this link is 3000Hz. My question is, why having a large range of available frequencies on a link increases the capacity of that link? 

I finally got around to solving this. I used a configuration called Masquerading in OpenWRT wiki. The two routers are put on different subnets. Router with Internet is on 192.168.1.1/24. The second router is on 192.168.10.1/24. The router without Internet is configured using OpenWRT. The 'lan' entry in looks like this: 

I'm not sure if I phrased the question correctly, so sorry for any confusion there. I have two routers. Routers are too far apart to connect them to each other using a cable. First is connected to Interent and has a single wlan interface. All devices on the LAN connect to it via WiFi. Second one has two wlan interfaces and no Internet connection. Here is a diagram made by Cont7e that describes what I want to achieve (thanks!): 

If you fancy using Linux, most distributions can be installed and booted off removable storage including external drives and SD cards. You could set aside a small partition on the external drive that is used for the Liunux OS, and then keep the rest as a FAT/NTFS filesystem. You will also need a tool on the Windows 7 machine that would synchronize the contents of the FAT/NTFS filesystem with a local directory. A tool like rsync is ideal, but not sure if one can be found for Windows. If you can't find it, another option is to run rsync from within the Linux OS on the external drive: boot it, sync the folders, and then boot Windows. Unless the files you are working on are large, I would suggest using an SD card instead of an external hard drive. It may not boot on some PCs, however, so you should first check. SD cards are far more robust than hard drives and there are large SD cards on market now that aren't too expensive (32GB should suffice for most purposes unless you are doing video or photo work). Booting from SD cards is also somewhat faster.
