I chose to use a more general approach than to assume that the files were all 8 characters long, but the real difference is that I neither need the construct nor to cram the variable into the (possibly unsafe) regexp environment. 

Some programs continue to use the ALSA system for sound, since PulseAudio has an emulation layer that catches these signals without any real issue. However, it is also possible, and Cockatrice seems to work this way from what you say, to use a specific PulseAudio driver directly to reduce complexity/latency/etc. There is no "reverse emulation" available from what I know - no "PulseAudio->ALSA" mechanism on the software side ("ALSA" unfortunately is an ambiguous word since it provides both a hardware driver and a software audio handler; PulseAudio uses ALSA drivers to communicate with the hardware, but jams itself in between ALSA's software and hardware constituents). All in all: no, if the program is written with PulseAudio exclusively in mind, I don't think there is a currently available way to turn the signals into ones that are understood by the ALSA software side. Perhaps it is possible to disable audio completely for Cockatrice, either at compilation time or at startup, to still be able to use it. And a last option is to spend the time making PulseAudio work on your machine instead. 

Issue in a terminal without arguments and press Ctrl+←. Paste the entire keycode that occurs ( in my case but most probably something else for you since it doesn't work by default) into the irssi bind command: 

ikiwiki is another alternative that does all that. The hosting is up to you, though there is a semi-official host in Branchable. ikiwiki generates static pages that can be hosted anywhere. ikiwiki is built around version control systems, primarily Git (it is usable with other systems, but not with all bells and whistles) . It is a nice fit for a blogging/wiki platform to have the VCS integrated in the content generation. It is open and configurable down to every bit. It is built with Perl, but as an end user there is no need to see any Perl unless one wants to extend or modify existing base code or plugins. 

Download the 32bit version of windows as ISO file and use WinToUSB to install the ISO on your hard drive whilst it's mounted on another computer. Demo of WinToUSB Here 

The answer to your question is that unfortunately this is not possible in Firefox. There are however some other distributions of Firefox such as WaterFox, PaleMoon and a few others. Some are tailored towards privacy and others towards added functionality and optimisation. Have a read here to see what the alternatives are. You may have better luck using a different browser but you cannot do what you're trying to do using Firefox itself. 

The solution to your problem is AutoHotkey With it you can write a script that does all the hard work for you. Mapping the actions required to 'right-click > copy link address' to a single key on the keyboard. To right-click with the keyboard you must press Shift+F10. This keyboard shortcut does not interfere with any default chrome shortcuts so you're safe to use it within your script. The following script will copy link address automatically when you click your media file and press F1 on your keyboard (you're free to change it to any key you like) Step 1 - Download and install AutoHotKey Step 2 - Right click on your desktop > New AutoHotKey script Step 3 - Open the AHK file in Notepad and paste in the following script: 

The answer to your question is that it is not possible to blur footage with the default set of Windows 7 apps. 'Windows Movie Maker' used to be the go to free software for basic editing but it's now only downloadable from Microsoft and isn't actually 'free' for all intensive purposes. Your solution is here: Download 'Shotcut' video editor for free here. Follow the instructional video on how to blur parts of an image using Shotcut Here 

Brief technical notes: there are technical difficulties with disk recovery and Ext3/4. It is a long thing to explain, but briefly (and inadequately): Ext3/4 removes the "markers" that tell the OS where files are located on disk when you delete them. The files aren't scrubbed, but no one knows where on the disk they start and end anymore, and sometimes they even are fragmented at several places. Some other file systems just set the files' statuses to "deleted", but keep the location data. Then undelete is not harder than to look at file pointers with this flag (they should still be available if not too much activity has occured), and then hope their content has not been overwritten. What is best? Rhetorical, in my view. Frequent backup is the answer to all these problems. Important data without an automated backup system is an accident waiting to happen, IMHO. 

You need to log it before you can display it. A popular logging and graphing tool is MRTG. (Posted this as a comment at first, but I guess it is a full answer in some respect.) 

Raise an existing terminal session, and if not found attach an existing session, and if not found start a session and then attach it. 

and thus I know that they represent VNC servers with display numbers and respectively, and can be killed by 

It could/would work, but you'd have to be careful to really take everything into account. Possibly changed init scripts, configuration files, the state of the package manager, etc. It would very soon become complex if you have made several changes and want to revert back to change -5 say. It's not just to remove the files and hope for the best; all configuration and state files would also have to be reverted, and maybe they are in a binary format and so on. In practice, there should not be any "cruft" left behind on Linux if you "know what you are doing" (tm). Files are contained in a much better way than on e.g. Windows, and are normally ordered into packages which are tracked by the package manager. If I on a Debian based system do 

Sounds like the solution to your problem is AutoHotKey. You can write a simple script that remaps any key combo of your choosing to any key on your keyboard. So if ALT+Numpad2 interferes with a preset shortcut in firefox, you can change it so that instead Shift+Numpad2 performs your desired action instead. 

AutoHotKey is the answer to your problem. With it you can create a script to automate your mouse and keyboard movements. You can have all of your URLs on a spreadsheet, and have AutoHotKey copy/paste the URLs into the address bar for you. You can even program it to do an 'image search' between every URL and perform a further action based on the results it finds. So if the web result says 'You Have Been Pwned!' you can have AutoHotKey detect that image on the screen (using the image_search function), go back to your spreadsheet, highlight the cell red, and then move onto the next URL. A piece of software that will prove itself very powerful for your purposes. You just need to do some minor research to understand the basic commands required to make the script work. So the workflow would be the following: 

If you select your media file and hit F1 it will perform the actions you usually do using the mouse but without you physically having to do it yourself. The 'Sleep' command value is set to 50ms. You can change this value if the script is running too fast to what you want but it should be fine. Step 4 - Double click your script to activate it. Right click the green 'H' icon in your hidden icons (start bar) to exit the script whenever you like. 

I'm using the EZConfig module for Xmonad. I would like to bind to first move my current focused window to my other screen, then move my focus to my other screen. Using the CycleWS module this would be achieved by running "shiftNextScreen" followed by "nextScreen" Can i bind two commands to one key? Also, i tried going 

I had this set last night and it didnt work so i dont know what the 'nights rest' did... Anyways, to all that use jk or any other alphabet sequence to escape from insert mode, i recommend doing this. 

When i compose a message with mutt, mutt first asks me if i would like to recall a postponed messsage. I do not want mutt to ask me this. Can i tell mutt to skip this step and get straight to the composing? 

Sometimes, for instance, when i have a terminal and firefox open in the same workspace, and then i close the terminal, firefox will not tile properly, that is it won't take up the full screen, it will just remain taking only half the screen. Is there a way to reload the window to make it tile properly or do i have to close and reopen each time? 

and pressing j in insert mode gives a delay determined by my timeoutlen, not my ttimeoutlen. What am i doing wrong? Is it even possible? Is it only possible for escape sequences? If so why? Thank you! 

But that doesnt work because nextScreen becomes an argument to shiftNextScreen, which doesn't make sense. I dont know haskell at all. 

I recently came across the timeout and ttimeout features in vim. I use the key sequence jk to escape from insert to normal mode. I thought, following this article Mapping fast keycodes [see 2b], that i could have my jk seqence obey the ttimeoutlen while all my other mappings obey timeoutlen. This would be ideal because i can hit jk really fast when i want to so it wouldnt interupt my typing when i need to insert a jk into a document. However, following the above mentioned article, it didnt work for me. I went 

Try holding down the power button for a long period of time until you hear a loud long beep come from the machine. This will force machine to 'hard' boot up and perform hardware checks as it does so. 

The answer to your question is that it is not possible to perform that action within Windows 10 using the standard software you have mentioned. That doesn't mean you cannot work around it though. To go to the end or beginning of a line your 'Go To' keys would be 'Home' and 'End'. If you prefer to remap Home/End to function with your Arrow keys then this is possible by writing a simple script using AutoHotKey. You could make an extremely simple script where if you press Ctrl + Up Arrow it will do 'Home'. Or if you press Ctrl + Down Arrow it will do 'End'. Example Script 1: ^Up:: Send, {Home} Example Script 2: ^Down:: Send, {End} 

MPEG Streamclip can merge all chapters in a loaded DVD and export it to MOV/MP4 file. It is free and is still widely used within the video post production industry so you can trust it to be a good shot at trying to rip your DVD. After your DVD is inserted, simply click on 'File > Open DVD' and you will be given options if you want to export specific chapters or the whole thing. It can also load individual VOB files for conversion if you wish. You won't be able to output to MKV but you can still make a high quality MOV out of it and then convert that to MKV if you need. 

Copy URL from spreadsheet Paste URL into google chrome address bar Run image search on resulting webpage -If image 'You have been pwned!' is detected mark cell red on spreadsheet and move onto next URL -If image 'You haven't been pwned' is detected - move onto next URL 

to see if there is some module dependency that can give you any information, but usually this won't help you much. If nothing of the above works, you can always reboot (or just wait until a natural reboot and run the old module version until then). I regularly update the Nvidia module in Debian Sid, and it almost always suffices to just kill X, reload module and restart. The reason I give a more elaborate process searching scheme is that I had trouble with an Opera bug in this regard, where the process kept hogging the module even after Opera itself was dead. 

in a terminal (run first if it complains about already being started, but since you say it doesn't work, it most probably is not running. Prefix if it complains about permissions) should get you more detailed output on why PulseAudio won't start, which will enable you to find more specific info in your case. If the error message is not clear enough, just keep adding :s, e.g. 

It takes a while for magnet links to find the torrent specification so the "real" download can start. The peers are found via trackers and/or DHT. If the trackers are down (or just take a long time to respond) or no peers are found, the torrent can't download the needed meta information to start. Try adding the torrent directly in rTorrent's command-line interface. This can be done by simply giving the magnet link as torrent path (if you have rTorrent >= 0.8.9 ). Start this torrent, and when the "real" torrent information is received, it will rename itself to the wanted file specifier. If this doesn't work either, then the issue is not with ruTorrent, at least. To remove rTorrent from the equation completely you'd have to try the torrent in another application. If you are the initial seeder of the torrent, you may have greater problems since I don't believe rTorrent can seed the torrent in itself yet. Someone can gladly counter me with working examples, and I have not tried it myself, but it's what I've heard.
