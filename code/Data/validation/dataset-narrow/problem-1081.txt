Here's what ended up working in my scenario. I used belarc advisor to retrieve my windows 8 pro upgrade key, reset my system to original windows 7, then popped in my windows 8 pro system builder disk. It asked to grab updates via web, if I wanted to wipe all settings, and then asked for my key. I typed in my upgrade key and it started preparing the install. It Went smooth enough that I'll probably end up doing this to our other "upgraded" PC's. I ended up not needing the trial key but it gives confidence if something would of went wrong. thanks 

I built a PC with a "refurbished" motherboard. I went to install windows 8.1 pro "full" on the system, and it didn't ask for an activation key, which has never happened. After it was done installing I thought that was odd so checked to see if it was activated, only to see that it was, just not with the "pro" version. So I tried erasing the drive and re-installing with a windows 8 pro "system builder" DVD, but the same thing happened. I have also tried "get more features with a new addition of windows" using multiple windows 8 pro keys, but it says they are no good. I assume because there not upgrade versions but system builder editions. I assume the mobo is still registered with windows 8 because I have managed to extract a windows 8 key using belarc. I need this PC to accept the windows 8 pro version that I am trying to install. Any ideas if I am missing something or a way to get this done? 

I don't know which version of "skype" you are using but this is the "desktop" version of skype I use as I hate the windows 8 version as well. $URL$ If so then... ~check for a beta version ~Try to temporarily disable your anti-virus or firewall software Here is how to completely uninstall Skype (just back-up all important files and information that you feel is important to you). This will remove all traces of the Skype application so you can install a "fresh" copy of Skype. $URL$ ~ download and run "ccleaner" or similiar to get rid of currupt files. Reset Internet Explorer to Default Regardless of the browser you set as default, as Skype uses Internet Explorer engines. You can also delete temp files, browsing history and clear cache. Also disable or remove any unused or bad IE add-ons or plugins. best of luck 

A laptop would seem like a good alternative, assuming your other data acquisition equipment doesn't need to stay powered on? But if it does, I would think most decent UPS's should be able to power your station for 15mins off/2hours on. I use one of these $URL$ to power our server and it'll last over an hour unplugged. So that would be a minimum four 15 minute unplugged time frames it could handle, not including the 2 hour intervals it would be charging. 

Another way to make sure is if you can borrow another computer, just log into your windows live account and change your password. Your laptops credentials will then no longer be valid regardless of if it automatically logs in or not. 

3CX is only IP so nothing but Ethernet cabling would be of much use. Even if you wanted to run an analog phone somewhere, you could still do that via Ethernet cabling and an FXO converter. I use 3CX as an intercom through a softphone on a PC. I even use Cat5e to run my loud speakers. PC 3.5mm jack to mini amp to cat5E to loudspeakers =) Video cabling would be for older analog security cameras. If you had an analog system though you could still use ethernet cables with baluns at the end to run those. I've been surprised at how many scenarios cheap Ethernet cabling has been able to work for me. 

If you have or could borrow a different power cord first I would start there. If it doesn't work with a different power cord though, I've seen a couple Dell laptops quit charging because of the power jack socket on the computer. Dell had a bad power jack socket design (IMO) that breaks easy internally, due to the leverage the power cord creates on it. It takes some skill to open a laptop and replace this though. But if you feel confident with small parts, clips, and screws, they are fairly cheap on eBay or Amazon. ex: $URL$ (except obviously you would look up your exact model this is just an exapmle) 

subnet: (A) 255.255.255.0 / (B) 255.255.255.0 router ip: (A) 192.168.0.1 / (B) 192.168.0.10 dhcprange: (A) 0.100-0.149 / (B) 0.150-0.199 I have two separate (mostly staitc) networks with two separate Internets linked via a PTP link. They both need to communicate as one(besides internet), and for the most part this setup has been working. There have been dhcp crossing issues and some other minor things though, which make me wonder if there is a better setup? The one below is my other idea but since it's a bit of work to shut things down was wondering if anyone thinks my network could be improved with some different numbers punched in? thx Jace 

If this "one" ethernet port is your WAN or the one coming out of your modem, and it doesn't have a built in router, or your modem only provides one WAN address, then it would make more sense to get a router instead of a switch. A router can hand out dhcp address's to your two client computers and provide security. If this is your scenario, I think it would be safer to get a router rather than buying a switch, just to find out you need a router. 

Electrical tape is definitely okay, even if it touches the video cable, and is probably actually what I'd recommend you use. I've used it to fix laptop power supply cables before. I've also use it on 110v house wires even as it does not conduct and is made for the such. 

Before I go to the work of calling my ISP I decided to see if this community has an answer. I have never had this issue before, and I also haven't done any hardware or firmware changes recently. So randomly this morning the domain "ebay.com" will not work. I can go to my history though and pull up something random that's "inside" that domain, like an item I visited yesterday, and that will pull up, but I can't get the main domain to load. Any ideas? 

I've ran into this same issue. A DVI-D is digital only port and even though you have a DVI-D adapter, an analog monitor will not work with the dvi "digital" port on your computer. I assume it's not a DVI-I port on your PC? If not you will have to buy an analog/digital converter to get this to work. Also important is to know a DVI "adapter" is not the same as a "converter". The fact they make so many types of DVI plugs makes this an easy mistake to make. 

So far this solution has worked. I got a generic windows 8.1 pro "upgrade key" (a key meant to upgrade from 8.1 standard to pro). I opened "get more features with a new addition of windows" and used this key. It worked and was now recognized as a windows 8.1 pro machine. I then opened "change product key" in system settings, used the system builder key I had, and activated it via phone, and all is good so far. 

I know a method to eliminate the text atleast. navigate to C:\Windows\System32\en-US. Find wininit.exe.mui and take ownership of it. Make a copy of this on your desktop. Then download "resource hacker" from here. $URL$ Drag the copy you made into resource monitor, and you will see a list of files that are inside this file. navigate to StringTable/63/1033 From there you will see the "please wait" text you were looking for. Change that, click "compile script", and then click on file and save it. This should bring up a new file on your desktop. Simply drop that back into the en-US folder and click "replace" to replace the old one. This is the way I've found to get rid of/ change the text. along with the "shutting down", "restart", and others. 

When hibernating, the big difference is that your PC has shut down and is NOT pulling power. Another difference is that your data is saved to your hard disk and not RAM. This makes it safer, as your less likely to loose your current session, but it is a slower option since the system has to actually restart and restore data to RAM. I wouldn't view sleep mode as being bad for your computer though, but if something did go wrong, you would for sure lose your current session. 

Press the Windows + R key combination to bring up a run box, type ncpa.cpl and hit enter. When your network connections open, right-click on your Wireless network adapter and select properties from the context menu. Now switch over to the Sharing tab and allow other devices to use your machines internet by selecting the first checkbox and then unchecking the second before clicking on the OK button. Now right-click in the bottom left of your screen, to launch an administrative command prompt. Now we need to set up the wireless network, this is done using the netsh command like so: netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=”NETWORKNAME” key=”Pa$$w0rd” Where "ssid" is the name of your network, and "key" is the password you want users to connect with, its also worth mentioning that the access point is created with WPA2-PSK (AES) encryption. Now we are ready to start broadcasting our network: netsh wlan start hostednetwork The last command you will need to know is the show command, it will tell you things like the channel you are on as well as the number of clients connected to your network: netsh wlan show hostednetwork Here's links to the above process encase your more of a visual learner: $URL$ or $URL$ 

You'll just need another wireless router. Connect it to the LAN pot of your first router at one end, and the other end to the LAN of your second router. Then set the second router to bridge mode (turn off NAT and DHCP services so that your main router is the only one handling these) and make your SSID, Security, and password the same. You may want to set different wireless channels on both routers to ensure both wireless signals don't interfere with each other, but with these steps, your devices should connect to whichever router is giving it the best signal at a given place seamlessly. Any router should work as long as you can do these required tasks on it. 

I remember reading this fixed this issue for someone. Unistall drivers and then reinstall them. Then go to: Power Options->Balanced ->Change power plan -> Change advanced power setting -> Wireless Adapter Setting -> Power Saving Mode ...and make sure these settings are selected-> On Battery: Max. Performance; Plugged in: Maximum Performance. If this doesn't work I would search for a different version of your wireless driver. 

Normally just holding "0" when you boot should bring up the factory reset options for vista on a Toshiba. If your talking resetting the bios though holding down F2 should bring up bios menu and you can reset from there. Or you can open up your laptop and remove the CMOS battery. 

Your MoBo will only support up to 1866mhz ram, so buying 2400mhz ram would only run at 1866 even if turned all the way up in bios. So I would just look for a good deal on 2x8GB of 1866mhz non ecc (desktop) ram. ex: $URL$ Also the lower the timing the better I believe, but I wouldn't worry too much about this. IMO 16GB is rarely neccesary, maybe see how much your even using as most only use about 4GB. BUT, It's your money and if you want 16GB then by all means you buy 16GB =) 

I have a windows 7 PC that I upgraded to windows 8 pro awhile back. This PC has been having some issues so I wanted to do a clean install, but I didn't make an ISO image of the windows 8 upgrade when I downloaded it. I do have a windows 8 system builder disk though from a different PC I built. Is it possible to do a clean install of my upgrade using the "system builder" disk and my upgrade key? I read some posts from a year ago saying you can do a clean install using the upgrade CD but didn't know if the system builder could be used instead to accomplish the same thing? Thanks 

Between using toothpaste, running without a heatsink for that long. and the bent pins I would say you definately need a new CPU. I would recommend buying the cheapest one of these or similiar $URL$ and just replace the CPU. Good chance the motherboards fine. Just remember the CPU has an arrow on one corner that will help you know which way it goes. On a side note sometimes messing around can get expensive so be careful, look-up some knowledge on the subject first, and enjoy. 

Not necessarily as your system isn't using 400W, that just means your psu could support UP TO 400W. And that's the same case with a UPS. 400W means UP TO 400W. Even though your system is maybe using around 200W, the higher the watts the UPS is rated at, the longer it would be able to run your system without power. So a 400W UPS would generally run your system longer than a 200W UPS. But other than that, you'd just have to read into a specific UPS to see how long it's expected to last @ a certain number of Watts and so on. 

Click on Start and then enter the following command in the search box: netplwiz Press the ENTER key. This command will load the Advanced User Accounts Control Panel applet. In the Users tab, uncheck the box next to Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer. Click on the Apply button at the bottom of the User Accounts window. When the Automatically Log On dialog box appears, enter the user name you wish to automatically login to Windows 7 with. Then enter your account password in the two fields where it's asked. Click the OK button. Click OK on the User Accounts window to complete the process. From now on, when your PC starts up, Windows 7 will log on automatically. 

The best I've used is "iFile" and/or "pc netowrking". It's an app in the cydia store though so you'd have to jailbreak. Jailbreaking and the things you can do with it is really becoming a simple and wonderful thing though now a days.
