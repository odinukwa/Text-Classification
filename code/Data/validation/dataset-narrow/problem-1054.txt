This summer, I got my the upgrade to Windows 10. The 'About computer' section in the settings, it said that I have a 32 bit OS, but x64 based processor. I've checked online and I saw that I can create a Windows 10 64-bit installation media, and install it on my computer and keep my files. Can I really upgrade this computer to x64 OS? Will it make my laptop to run faster? Thanks. 

I have Lenovo G510 laptop with 4GB RAM and Intel i5 4200M 2.50GHz processor. Recently, my laptop disconnects every time from my home WiFi network. In addition, my trackpad sometimes freezes, and I can't move the mouse, but I can still control my laptop. Sometimes it's even worse, and the whole computer just freezes. I thought maybe it is an old driver issue, but since I have Windows 10 32-bit, I cannot download any drivers for my computer from Lenovo's website, since they only have drivers for Windows 10 64-bit. Is there any operation I can do in order to fix this? It is really urgent, since this is my main computer and most of my work is online... 

I can't seem to find the latest version of wget easily using a Google Search. I'm looking for a Windows version that I can use, and no one seems to have it. 

First I want to start off by saying, that I am in the planning stages of this. I have bought no hardware, and everything is a possibility to ensure the success of this project while keeping convenience and portability in mind. I am looking for a solution that will allow me to have 2 RAID arrays comprised of 2x 3Tb drives each. These will be my LTRS drives. Referred to as LTRS0, first array, and LTRS1, second array. These drives are meant to store my work, music, videos, and documents from system build to system build. I want to ensure their long term integrity by placing them within RAID 1. Basically, LTRS0 will have 2 HDD of 3Tb in RAID 1, LTRS1 will have 2 HDDs of 3TB in RAID 1, but they can contain different data. I want to know what my best option is based on these requirements. Should I get a PCI(e) card that I can take from system to system as I build them, or should I get a NAS and put all of my data in that, or should I use the on board motherboard controller and just make sure I have the same controller from system build to system build? 

You can run iterations of the program in a loop; and divide the total time by the number of iterations: 

Another solution would be to use rsync. (Be careful with the trailing slashes. They are important). This will copy everything in newstuff into oldstuff. 

If the data of the two files is expected to be exactly the same, you can get the MD5 checksum of each file in the second folder; sort the list; and for each image in the first folder, search for a matching checksum. On OSX, the command is "md5", but, in Linux it is md5sum. 

There is also a preference file and data in your folder, that you could move somewhere temporarily to see if it solved the problem. 

I just had a similar problem; but, instead of disappearing, the icons were corrupted, like what happens to the display when a graphics board fails (a few were disappeared). did not work, but, removing the icon cache (in ) and then brought everything back. You can get the path if you and replace at the end with (This is probably only valid for snow leopard, and the path and filename has changed in 10.7 or 10.8) 

I've recreated the spreadsheet in Google Docs, and if you can provide an answer for Excel or Google Docs that'd be great. As far as Microsoft Office, I've looked up, SUMIF(), VLOOKUP() but the combination of these items is starting to look more like line noise then functions. I just can't quite wrap my head around it. 

I have a USB Thumb Drive that I was going to use to install Windows 7 with. While formatting the drive with the Windows 7 USB/DVD download tool it failed leaving my USB drive in an unusable state. I can see the drive with the Windows Disk Manager, but it shows that it has a RAW file system, and any time I try to reformat it a second time, it simply says that It can't find the file or partition. Using DiskPart I've also not had very much luck as trying to use the command results in an error. These are the commands I'm using and their output. 

Note that neither of these commands will do anything to the files in ~/newstuff though. If you want to delete them, you'll have to do the command separately. 

Your script is most likely removing the directory, and not just the files which are there. So, when you have 'd into it, and the directory is removed, you do on a directory which does not actually exist. By and you move up and back into the (newly created) directory, and the files are there as you expect. The best alternative is instead of ing in and out of the directory, is to add the directory name to your command, and run it from the parent directory. So, instead of just . 

And, the code below will copy everything in newstuff into oldstuff, and delete anything in oldstuff which is not in newstuff. 

Go to your start menu (Click the Windows Orb). Type in in the search text field, and press enter. Goto . Under the key create a key called . Under create a key called . Set the value of in the Command key to be . 

Because the firewall only allows connections to the outside internet through the proxy server from port 80 and port 443, I reconfigured my SSH server to accept connections from port 443. The problem I'm seeing is that once I try an SSH connection the connection reports as connection timeout from Sublime Text when using the SFTP plugin. Using PuTTY results in an instant . Google Chrome Extension Secure Shell gives me a more detailed error of 

Any idea's what I can do to fix this? I would like to SSH into my server, there must be a way to do this using only Cntlm's Tunneling feature, I just don't know what I am doing wrong. I can tell you that I can connect to my SSH server using port 443 from outside of the corporate network. 

I have Windows 10 in English, but the Left-to-Right isn't so comfortable for me. How can I switch to Right-to-Left but stay with the English language as the main display language of the system? 

I have a Lenovo G510 laptop. I'm an android developer, and most of the time I'm working with the Android Studio program. As some of you know, android studio takes about 1 GB from my RAM and the Java program takes another 200 MB, while the G510 has 4 GB RAM Memory. When I'm working with android studio, the Program Manager normally says that I'm using about 95%-99% of my RAM Memory, even when there is no other programs on the background. I have 2 questions about it: 

1. How many of my RAM Memory is for my own usage? Because some of the websites says 1.5 GB and the others says 2.5 GB, and there are a few websites that says that I can use the whole 4 GB. 

It might be spotlight-related, as you mentioned. Assuming your mail accounts are IMAP, then one thing to try is to quit Mail. In your ~/Library/Mail/ folder, there is a file "Envelope Index". Move that file to a safe place (like, your Desktop), and restart mail. You will probably see a "welcome" screen, and then Mail will go through your messages. After the main Mail window finally appears, it might be slow for a while, as Spotlight will again re-index the messages; but, not as slow as before. In general, I've found that this is a fairly reliable way to fix the problem you're having; and, have done it for several accounts at work. The "Envelope Index" file will be recreated; but, it should be a "cleaner" version. 

Your file has (CR+LF) line endings (likely, created in windows?), whereas most UNIX files only end in (LF). So, before grep sees the after the character, there is the that it has to match with the wildcard. 

So, I turn to you, of the options given, what's the best one to meet the goal of long term redundant storage. If you could provide product details that would be great, or information on your own in house solution. 

You can find a windows, working, compile of wget 1.13.4 here, they also seem to keep up to date windows compiles of popular GNU/Linux soft ware on this site. 

The issues that come with each are somewhat daunting as well, as for example the first option PCI(e) might get in the way of a Cross Fire or SLI setup. The second option NAS might be slower then internal storage as it's going across a 1Gbps link and not say a 3Gbps SATA, or 6Gbps SATA interconnect. The other option would be a light path / thunderbolt NAS but those tend to run expensive and I don't own a Mac, and I can't seem to find a Thunberbolt PCI(e) card on line, and that might have the same issues as the first option (getting in the way of an SLI / CX setup. The third option might not work as well because manufactures might change RAID controllers from motherboard to motherboard and that would reduce the LTRS lifetime. 

I have a laptop running Windows 10 32-bit which I got last year as part of Microsoft Windows 10's free upgrade plan. In Settings -> Updates and Security -> Activation it says that my Windows is activated using digital license linked to my Windows Microsoft account. Is there a way to switch from 32-bit to 64-bit version without buying a new Windows 10 license? 

On my Windows 7 computer I have 2 drives, C: and D:. On C: drive I have my system installation, and on the D: drive I have my personal data. I want to sync data between C: and D: on the user folder, so everything will be in the same place, and I could treat D: files path as C: drive. Is there any way to do that? 

When the save dialog is open, Command + Shift + G will allow you to type the path you want to go to. It requires you to either know the full path (and type it in correctly), or have copied the full path to the clipboard. So, there's likely still some more work to be done in turning this into a simple workflow. 

I believe that Terminal.app will only expand in increments of one display line of text. The gap you are seeing is because there is not enough space to increase the height by another line of text. There is a third-party application, iTerm, which may behave differently but I haven't tried it. 

It may be that the short tag is not supported. Try changing the file to start with as the first line?
