If it's windows 8.1 "pro pack" (the only 8.1 "upgrade" I know of) then the answer is no as this is the upgrade from windows 8.1 to 8.1 pro. If it's windows 8.1 pro "full" or "system builder" then the answer is yes. I believe it can only be one of these three for windows 8.1. 

I figured I would post what ended up fixing this in my scenario. In DD-WRT under setup/networking, I turned on IGMP snooping for bridge 0. I then had to add this startup command: insmod ebtables insmod ebtable_filter insmod ebt_pkttype ebtables -A FORWARD -o "eth1" --pkttype-type multicast -j DROP ebtables -A OUTPUT -o "eth1" --pkttype-type multicast -j DROP After finally figuring out that it took both of these steps, things seem to be working fine again. 

The only "work around" I have found for this is to go to "device manager" and uninstall "Intel(R) HD Graphics" driver under Display adapters. This causes the screen to go black, but pushing (not holding) the power button lets the system restart and then the touchscreen works. I had to do this every time but here lately it every once in awhile works without this "workaround". But I have always been able to fix it by doing the above steps. 

Here's the commands I ran Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600] (c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. C:\Users\jayson>ipconfig /flushdns Windows IP Configuration Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache.

If the STOP 0x1E error message lists a driver by name, disable or remove that driver. If this resolves the issue, contact the hardware manufacturer for more information about how to obtain the latest version of the driver. 

One way you could do this is to is to hit the windows key+q and go to "change device installation settings" and tell windows to not search for driver updates. 

Something important to watch for that you may not know about is ecc/buffered RAM and non ecc/unbuffered RAM. Your motherboard will either support one or the other, not both. Most boards use unbuffered but you might want to check your board or see which your current RAM is. Besides what you already listed, this is the only real "show stopper" I can think of. It would definitely be best though to look up your motherboard and see the specs it lists for ram: max GB, max speed, nonecc or ecc, etc. I've never had issues mix and matching ram brands, but manufactures recommend against it. Most recommend buying ram in a set when replacing them as they are factory "matched" when in a set. 

This has no "noticeable" effect on battery life. A battery at 50% and then being unplugged, is the same as a battery unplugged at 100% but currently at 50% due to use. In theory it has the exact same effect on the charge either way. A battery at 50% is a battery at 50%. The only thing that really "helps" battery life that I have found is to keep it plugged in and not let it use it's charge, as often as possible. From my experience over many laptops this seems to be true. Also just food for thought going with that article. Whats the difference between never letting a battery go over 80% and a good battery that after years of use finally wears down to only 80%? Even if you got a few more uses because of never going over 80%, "battery hours" would still probably be close to the same since you get more "hours" out of a 100% battery. 

You have a couple of errors in your zone config. The biggest one is the incorrect IP address A valid IP only allows up to 255. I have built your zone into one of my test servers and it loads once the errors have been fixed (I changed the IP to become .8 (as per your rev-zone). There was a clue in the log output you got when trying to start named. Here is a working zone file tested on bind-9.8; 

This answer presumes you have access to the admin page on the DIR-655 and physical access to the device cabling. Presuming all of these devices share a common IP subnet (Address range) then you should be able to do the following; 

Firstly ntpdate is depreciated so you shouldn't use that in a production environment now. You should configure and run the ntp daemon correctly configured instead for a reliable timing setup and removing the chances that you will jump the server time (as ntp will continually adjust the clock as required) As you have seen the problem with just using the pool is that you may get any server it decides based on the dns query, in your situation you should pick 3 - 5 low stratum servers directly and add those to your config on both machines. ntp likes to have a minimum of 3 servers and ideally 5 to sync from to ensure a robust time domain. If you pick some low stratum servers they should all be within a few ms of each other (if not better) and provided they are configured correctly you shouldn't need to worry. If your requirements grow and you need to sync more machines then you could run your own server to ensure that what you serve internally only ever comes from 1 reference source at a time. 

If no script exists anywhere for your app then have a look on your system for the following file; on my Centos 6.8 system its located at but if you do a you should find it. It's a skeleton script that you can copy, modify then use for most things. Once you get it configured you can use it via as you would any other init script. There are a couple of good websites which may help here and here. 

Note the line that needs to be changed to You should then be able to list the repo. In your origional question it appears you have installed the CentOS 7 file (as denoted by the part) You should be using the CentOS 6 file which can be downloaded from here. (Remembering to enable the correct sections/versions) 

If you are on a linux client with ntp installed & configured to point at the Windows DC you can do; which will return all the info. If you need help to understand it please post it here and we can help. or which will do a 1 time query of the time/date but NOT set the client. 

You will need to test this - I'm basing it on the fact the D-Link will forward the DHCP requests from the clients to the Belkin. If it does not and you can't get an IP address or find your self disconnected then you could configure the D-Link DHCP server to issue address at the higher end of your network - You will need to check at the Belkin is configured to do so you can avoice any address conflicts. This should at a very basic level allow you to 'roam' between the wifi routers as you want. You may have to have a play with the channel settings as well - if they are far enough apart not to interfere they can both be on the same fixed channel. The English product manual can be found here. 

If you have a smart phone connected to the same network try using "fing" it finds all devices on a network and there names. Or sometimes I log onto our router and check the list of connected devices and then ping them. 

If this is the same as windows 7 then unfortunately microsoft doesn't have an option to give users control over this. So with that, granted this is going to sound unorthodox, it's the fix many use in windows 7. Just cut a thin strip of electrical tape and cover pin 19 on your tv's hdmi cable. This is the pin that tells the computer the display is off. If your monitor doesn't turn on after doing this try going into screen resolution and clicking "detect". Again I know this sounds odd but it's a fix many use if you can't find a different workaround. 

In windows 10 (once you connect) you just go to Settings/Netowrk&Internet/click on the SSID name and scroll down to properties. It tells you the Band, protocol, channel, security type, and all that good stuff. update: Only on windows 10 anniversary update and up

I manage our shops network, and twice in the last year a single device has completely killed our network. When this happens you can't even access the router until you find/unplug the device and restart the router. The first time ended up being a netgear access point that wasn't unplugged before the wireless started on the repeater (making a network loop). The second time was when our network phones were updating firmware via our phone server and the phone server froze somehow causing one of the phones to be stuck in a download phase and another bricked. Somehow this brought our whole network down until I found and unplugged those phones affected. My question is, is it normal for a network to be this easy to break, or is it sooner something with my network? Could you connect into any network and bring it down with a single device from the inside, or are there further measures that can be taken to prevent devices from easily crashing the router? My network is an r7000 router running DDWRT, 12+ windows 7/8 computers, XBlue phone server with network phones, ip cameras, printers, 2 ubuntu bridges connecting other computers/cameras, phones, etc using IPV4 

I have two PC's here at our shop that I play media on (local not streaming) 24/7 via windows media player. The one is a windows 8 in our break-room that I have a playlist of 394 short avi videos that it plays. The other is a windows 7 that has a big music playlist it goes through. Both are set to "random" and "repeat" but they both will randomly just stop every once in awhile when switching songs/videos. Sometimes they'll stop within an hour (more so the videos), and sometimes they'll play most of the day and be stopped when I come in the next morning. I figured this was something simple so it's driving me nuts that I haven't figured it out. I have never been at the screen when it stops, but when it does stop it's just the way it would stop when it's done playing something if "shuffle" and "reapeat" were not on. So I then have to push play again and it will continue playing the playlist until it decides it's done again. So my question is, any ideas of a setting I'm missing? Or if no ideas on that any ideas of a good media player for playing media 24/7? Thanks Jace
