I have seen this error numerous times when mucking about in SQL Server and recognize it as a Transact SQL error message, but can't find the actual SQL statement that is being executed so that I may determine the source of the error. EDIT: After enabling verbose logging on the MCMS 2002 Migration category, and poring through the Unified Logging Service (ULS) logs, I received a more complete stack trace at the point of the error, and a couple more anomalies listed below. Anomalies: The following is an abbreviated listing from the ULS logs around the time of the pre-migration analysis. 

The stack trace of the failed parsing of the SQL command appear on lines 15-17. A cleaner version of the stack trace is appended below. Full Stack Trace: 

Specifically, the two High level alerts on lines 4 and 5 are reflected in the migration report as warnings when running Pre-migration Analysis or running the migration profile. In addition, two other warnings appear in the migration report indicating two tables containing data ( and ) that should be empty. According to the documentation, warnings are not sufficient cause to stop migration from occurring. Other anomalies are on lines 7-20 indicating a series of tests that are The ULS doesn't give any additional warnings to indicate that the database check was blocked or exited in exceptional circumstances. After switching the profile from pre-migration analysis to exporting, there is one medium level warning that . As with all the skipped test names and SQL table names from the warnings, the major search engines are unable (with the exception of ) to find any reference to these objects or tests. Finally, the section of the log indicating the actual live migration attempt is appended below: 

I am attempting to migrate data from an Microsoft Content Management Server (MCMS) 2002 instance into a new Microsoft Office Sharepoint Server (MOSS) 2007 installation using the Manage Microsoft Content Management Server Migration Profiles tool in the Operations space of MOSS Central Administration. When analyzing the profile, I receive 4 warnings, all of which may be safely ignored, but when I actually execute the migration profile, I get the same warnings and an additional error with a description of: 

I just had the exact same problem with my installation of an Ubuntu server. It turned out all I had to do was 

I've got 4 Servers under the following config: Servers 1 and 3(Web Server, Mail server respectivelly): NIC1: Public Network, Connected to the Internet NIC2: Private Network, Communication between servers. Servers 2 and 4 (DB and Backup Server): NIC: Private Network, Communication between servers. I'm trying to find a way to route the traffic of apt(only) from Servers 2 and 4 through one of the two servers connected on the public network to the internet so that I won't have to connect these two servers to the public network just for apt. Are there any ways to do this? Thanks a lot. 

I've currently got only one server running Webserver,DB server and Mail server and I want to distribute the services in 3 servers to reduce the strain put on that single server. I've got to NICs on each server so I'm planning on using 2 LANs to provide an extra layer of security. On the private network(the one used only by these computers) I'm going to connect the DB Server, an additional backup server and one of the NICs of the Web server. On the public network(the one connected to the Internet) I'm going to connect the other NIC of the Web server. I have no idea however on which network to connect the Mail server. Does it need to be directly connected to the Internet or does the traffic flow through the Web server? Thanks a million. 

Before I start I'd like to say that I've already read relevant questions here on serverfault but I couldn't find a solution. Here's my problem. I'm using a third party DNS and I've added a wildcard A record *.biglle.com which points to my server's ip address. The problem I'm having with that is that every non existent sub-domain points to biglle.com(those that do exist work fine). I'd like to note that the apache website configuration for biglle.com is not the default one (000-default.conf) but a separate one (biglle.com.conf). That's what I can't understand. The non-existent subdomains should point to the default configuration file, shouldn't they? Here is part of biglle.com.conf 

By selecting the web pages to print, right-clicking and selecting Print from the context menu, I was able to print multiple documents to the printer, each starting on a new page. The documents were sent to my machine's default printer, and a separate print dialog box was generated for each web page. In that respect, the drag-and-drop option is probably better. If the print command from the context menu is failing to work you, you may verify what application is registered as the default print command for that document type. On my machine (Windows Server 2003) I go to Tools | Folder Options | File Types tab and scroll in the list to the file extension I am attempting to print (in my case HTM) and select the Advanced button which opens an Edit File Type dialog. From there, I click the Print entry in the Actions: list and click the Edit... button. In my case, the application that prints web pages is msohtmed. The specific settings for my Print command are as follows: 

None of this log information indicates the SQL command that is failing a parser check. I've checked the SQL servers hosting the source and destination databases for a trace of the query, but neither seems to have triggered the parse failure condition. That appears to have happened on the SharePoint server. Are there any other locations I should investigate that might tell me where to find the source of the error? 

This information directs default printing of HTM documents to be routed through a light-weight editor that is a part of MS Office 2007. If you installed other HTML editors and indicate that they should become the default handler of files with the HTM extension, then it is possible that this application takes over default printing duties as well. This dialog box will show you exactly which application you need to blame/fix in order to get your printing from a context menu working again. Best of luck.
