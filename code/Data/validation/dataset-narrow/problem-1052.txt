I manage our shops network, and twice in the last year a single device has completely killed our network. When this happens you can't even access the router until you find/unplug the device and restart the router. The first time ended up being a netgear access point that wasn't unplugged before the wireless started on the repeater (making a network loop). The second time was when our network phones were updating firmware via our phone server and the phone server froze somehow causing one of the phones to be stuck in a download phase and another bricked. Somehow this brought our whole network down until I found and unplugged those phones affected. My question is, is it normal for a network to be this easy to break, or is it sooner something with my network? Could you connect into any network and bring it down with a single device from the inside, or are there further measures that can be taken to prevent devices from easily crashing the router? My network is an r7000 router running DDWRT, 12+ windows 7/8 computers, XBlue phone server with network phones, ip cameras, printers, 2 ubuntu bridges connecting other computers/cameras, phones, etc using IPV4 

If you have a smart phone connected to the same network try using "fing" it finds all devices on a network and there names. Or sometimes I log onto our router and check the list of connected devices and then ping them. 

If your virus scan doesn't pick it up as a virus, it doesn't mean it isn't dangerous. If you're wondering what the program can do, try searching the program name () on Google. This page says it's not a harmful program and can be deleted through the software add/remove option in the Control Panel: $URL$ This page also refers to it as safe, although it's only found on one computer. They also refer to the same distributor: $URL$ I would say it's an outdated piece of software. If you can find the software in the Control Panel option under 'Logo Business Solutions company' and you do not use it, I'd suggest you remove it. If you're unsure if you can remove it, try renaming the file under or moving it to another location. If your software and computer keep working fine, you can remove the program from your computer. 

I cannot seem to remove the number 7,8 nor drag the allocated partition (E:) to the beginning of the file. I already tried making the unallocated space bigger by shrinking the partition, but once I added it back to the partition, the 7,8MB remained unallocated. 

Right click on the windows audio icon, and open Playback Devices. If supported, your HDMI audio should show up there somewhere.. Select it and set it to default. You may need to relog to Windows for it to work but it should work. 

[Rewritten for conciseness and clarity.] My setup: I have a PreSonus AudioBox USB connected to my laptop (Asus G750Z-DB73) via USB 3.0. The AudioBox driver, bundled with the app “Universal Control”, is regularly updated (currently v2.5.3). I’m running Windows 8.1 Pro (x64). As of a couple weeks ago (I cannot remember whether this coincides with an AudioBox driver update), my computer’s audio frequently and randomly cuts out; no apps make any sound, and the volume slider doesn’t produce any “ding” when clicked (the little green volume level bar is frozen). I fix this by either restarting the Windows Audio service in Task Manager or manually disconnecting and reconnecting the AudioBox USB cable; afterwards the audio starts working immediately. I still have to restart most open apps (such as Firefox) to “unmute” them, though. This happens very unpredictably; the sound can cut out five times in as many minutes whilst watching a video, then keep working without issue for the next several hours. Pursuant to the replies, I’ve checked the Event Viewer, and I found something interesting: Under “Application and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Audio”, the “GlitchDetection” log is absolutely packed with events (it says “Number of events: 2,597 (!) New events available”), up to dozens per second. Most of them are the same (the numbers vary slightly): 

Update: Found something else when the sound cut just now: In Event Viewer, under “Application and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Audio > PlaybackManager”, there’s just as many events, and they reveal that the sampling rate switches a lot between the default: 

I'm trying to get a custom boot logo to work, but I have to place it on the HP_Tools partition. I cannot see this partition, neither from Windows' partition manager and from EaseUS Partition Master. How do I get my custom boot logo to work? I already know the requirements for the image: 

Is it possible to delay the default shutdown from Windows? I installed BitTorrent Sync and I want to give it 30 minutes to finish syncing when I go away from my computer and then shut down. I know this is possible using 

It's some kind of glitch in the syncing process (maybe something got corrupted?). I'm not sure but some people have been able to fix it by toggling the 'sync automatically' button and sync their iDevice. Possibly repeat once or twice. If that doesn't work, try duplicating the file or importing it again to iTunes (copy it from iTunes Media if it's there). Another issue might be that the file of the song is corrupted. Try to identify the file and see if you can play it with any other music player. If not, delete it from there and download, rip or buy the song again. 

Try inserting a one-celled table inside that cell and insert the picture in that table, so you have a picture inside the new one-celled table.
