Given a finite alphabet set $\Sigma$, the set $\Sigma^{\omega}$ of infinite words over $\Sigma$ can be topologized with a metric $d: \Sigma^{\omega} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such as: $\forall w_1, w_2 \in \Sigma^{\omega}:\ d(w_1, w_2) = \frac{1}{2^n}$, where $n$ is the longest common prefix. Given a linear-time (LT) property $P \subseteq \Sigma^{\omega}$, $P$ is a liveness property iff it is a dense subset of $\Sigma^{\omega}$. Also, $P$ is a safety property iff it is a closed set. According to this topology, every finite prefix $u \in \Sigma^{\ast}$ corresponds to the ball of all infinite extensions of $u$. The radius of that ball is inverse-exponentially related to the length of $u$. I have one question: 

I have two questions: By starting with a nondeterministic BÃ¼chi automaton (NBA) $\mathcal{A}^{\varphi} = (Q, \Sigma, \rightarrow, I, F )$ for an $\omega$-regular property $\varphi$, we can construct a NFA $\widehat{\mathcal{A}}^{\varphi} = (Q^{\prime}, \Sigma, \rightarrow^{\prime}, I^{\prime}, F^{\prime} )$ that recognizes the bad prefixes of $\varphi$ as the complement of NFA $\overline{\mathcal{A}}^{\varphi} = (Q, \Sigma, \rightarrow, I, F_1 )$: For every state $q \in Q$, if there is a nontrivial strongly connected component (SCC) $C \subseteq Q$ such that $C \cap F \neq \emptyset$ and $C$ is reachable from $q$, then $F_1 \leftarrow F_1 \cup \{q\}$. Basically, $q$ is in $F_1$ iff the language of $\mathcal{A}^{\varphi}$ starting from $q$ is nonempty. N.B. A SCC consisting of a single state with a self-loop is considered nontrivial SCC. 

This is not an "answer" to my question, but rather an extended comment that people here might find interesting. I claim that there is a natural "analysis-type" definition of a maze and a solution, and it differs from the computer-science/graph-theoretic definition we've used here. In particular, you can have a fractal maze that has a "solution" under the analysis definition, but would be declared unsolvable by Marizio De Biasi's algorithm and Peter Shor's pushdown automata technique. Definition: A maze $M$ is a compact subset of the plane $M \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ containing a start point and an endpoint $s,e \in M$, respectively. A solution is a continuous function $f:[0,T] \rightarrow M$ such that $f(0)=s$ and $f(T)=e$. Now consider the the Hilbert Curve: 

A fractal maze is a maze which contains copies of itself. Eg, the following one by Mark J. P. Wolf from this article: 

Impagliazzo, Paturi and Calabro, Impagliazzo, Paturi introduced Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH) and Strongly Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH). Roughly, SETH says that there is no algorithm which solves SAT in time $1.99^n$. I was wondering what would that mean to break SETH. We definitely need to find an algorithm which solves SAT in fewer than $2^n$ steps, but I don't quite understand what computational model we should use. As far as I know, results based on SETH (see, e.g., Cygan, Dell, Lokshtanov, Marx, Nederlof, Okamoto, Paturi, Saurabh, Wahlstrom) don't need to make assumptions about the underlying model of computation. Assume, for example, that we found an algorithm which solves SAT in time $1.5^n$ using space $1.5^n$. Does it automatically imply that we can find a Turing Machine which solves this problem in time $1.99^n$? Does it break SETH? 

Several state of the art approximate nearest neighbor methods in high dimensions are based on reducing the dimension of the space through randomized techniques. The main idea is that you can exploit concentration of measure to greatly reduce the dimension of the space while preserving distances up to tolerance $\epsilon$. In particular, following from the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma (upper bound) and a result of Noga Alon (lower bound), there exists a subspace of reduced dimension $$C_1 \frac{\log(N)}{\epsilon^2 \log(1/\epsilon)} \le \text{reduced dimension} \le C_2\frac{\log(N)}{\epsilon^2}$$ such that for any two points $u,v$ in your collection, their projections $\tilde{u}, \tilde{v}$ onto the reduced dimensional space satisfy $$(1-\epsilon)||u-v||^2 \le ||\tilde{u} - \tilde{v}||^2 \le (1+\epsilon)||u-v||^2.$$ Indeed, such subspaces are "typical" in a sense, and you can find such a subspace with high probability by simply projecting your points onto a completely random hyperplane (and in the unlikely event that such a hyperplane is not good enough, just pick another random one and project again). Now you have a nearest neighbor problem on a much much lower dimensional space. A key paper is, 

In 1988 Karchmer and Wigderson established a nice characterization of the circuit depth $d$ (DeMorgan circuits) of a Boolean function $f \colon \{0,1\}^n\rightarrow\{0,1\}$: $d$ is exactly the number of bits that Alice and Bob need to communicate in order to find an index $i$ such that $a_i \neq b_i$, where Alice knows $a \in f^{-1}(0)$ and Bob knows $b \in f^{-1}(1)$. What is known about upper bounds proved for such games? I've only managed to find the following three results: 1) $2\log n$ upper bound for Parity function (binary search). 2) Chin proved $2.88\log n$ upper bound for $MOD_3$, $3.47\log n$ for $MOD_5$, $4.93\log n$ for $MOD_{11}$ ($URL$ 3) Brodal and Husfeldt proved an $O(\log n)$ upper bound for all symmetric functions ($URL$ Are these the only known (non-straightforward) protocols? 

If $k$ subsets of size $n/k$ don't intersect (i.e. the union of these sets form all the set $\{1..n\}$), then the sum of their labels is in $S$. Otherwise, the sum of their labels isn't in $S$. 

If a solution exists, breadth-first-search should find a solution. However, suppose there is no solution to the maze - then our search program would run forever going deeper and deeper. My question is: given a fractal maze, how can we determine if it has a solution or not? Or alternatively, for a fractal maze of a given size (number of inputs/outputs per copy), is there a bound on the length of the shortest solution? (if there was such a bound, we could exaustively search only that deep) 

Since the Hilbert Curve iterations converge uniformly, that uniform limit is a continuous path that solves the maze in the analytic sense. It's as if you were able to do the following recursively defined infinite set of moves $P$: $P = APA^{-1}BPB^{-1}CPC^{-1}DPD^{-1}$ Now you might argue that this is not in the spirit of fractal mazes since the Hilbert curve fills the entire square and therefore you could just draw a straight line segment from the start to the finish. This objection is easily overridden though - simply use the hilbert curve diagram embedding directly, as shown here: 

Fix $k\ge5$. For any big enough $n$, we would like to label all subsets of $\{1..n\}$ of size exactly $n/k$ by positive integers from $\{1...T\}$. We would like this labelling to satisfy the following property: there is a set $S$ of integers, s.t. 

I've studied the problem and I found some results. Shortest Common Superstring (SCS) can be solved in time $2^n$ with only polynomial space(Kohn, Gottlieb, Kohn; Karp; Bax, Franklin). The best known approximation is $2\frac{11}{30}$ (Paluch). The best known approximation of compression is $3\over4$ (Paluch). If SCS can be approximated by a factor $\alpha$ over the binary alphabet, then it can be approximated by a factor $\alpha$ over any alphabet (Vassilevska-Williams). SCS cannot be approximated with a ratio better than $1.0029$ unless P=NP (Karpinski, Schmied). Maximal Compression cannot be approximated with a ratio better than $1.0048$ unless P=NP (Karpinski, Schmied). I would be grateful for any additions and suggestions.
