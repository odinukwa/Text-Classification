Once you find the problematic device (its icon will be faded as it's currently unplugged), either update the driver or uninstall (delete) completely the device so Windows will install it again (with the correct driver) the next time you plug it in. 

Basically, no. You lost all access to the file. Only root can change the permissions on that file. Contact your system administrator, or the admins of the hosting company or ISP hosting the site. 

WinRM is equivalent to the RPC calls used for remote administration and process execution, but it's based on the Web Services for Management (WS-Management) standards You can use it to retrieve information about a remote computer, or execute processes remotely. NO idea about Linux clients, but Windows 7 has a client, meaning an application that can access a WinRM server running on a computer. You'll find more information in this blog article: What is WinRM? 

You should check for the reasons of the high temperature: broken fan, clogged airvents, fan set to a too low speed, ... 

Picasa does face recognition. If you use "name tags" to identify someone, it'll tell you which pictures contains which person. 

You can also change the brightness using a slider with Desktop Lighter, but I don't know if it works with Windows 7: 

You'll find more information about the DNS cache, how to disable it, and its settings in this article of the Microsoft Knowledge Base. 

It really looks to me like it's linked to a networking issue. Shouldn't a firewall on your host PC be opened for traffic from the VM software. Looks to me like all the FTP commands are allowed (port 20) but when you start an actual data transfer, it cannot open the data channel (on port 21). Do you have the same error with other commands that transfer data? Like "LIST" for instance. Try passive mode (command "PASV") as it will not open a different channel for data. 

There are wireless USB hubs (like this one) but they do not rely on Bluetooth for communication. I haven't used one (they're still pretty expensive) so I'd suggest you search for "wireless USB hub" on your favorite search engine for models and reviews. 

Isn't this interpreted by Windows as a double-click followed by a single click? I've never heard of this and neither have seen mouse events able to manage a triple-click. 

Warning: the format of the date (yyyymmdd=%%k%%j%%i) depends on your regional settings. Because I use the French date format (dd/mm/yyyy), I have to use "%%k%%j%%i" as the format (%%i = day, %%j = month, %%j = year). If your regional settings are set to US style (mm/dd/yyyy), you should use "%%k%%i%%j" (%%i = month, %%j = day, %%j = year). 

Maybe Microsoft has included parts of code required for the virtualization in the Windows kernel or in system DLLs. That would explain why VirtualBox is bigger, as they have to deliver all the code necessary for the virtualization, the GUI, the tools, ... while only a part of it is included in the VirtualPC setup. 

I don't know if there is such an add-on made by IBM, but a lot of programs can do this. One of them is Eusing Software Auto Window Manager. It can save your desired settings so it'll work each time one of the specified windows opens. 

A quick search on Google tells me it's a WD Scorpio Blue SATA drive (80 GB, SATA 1.5 Gb/s, 8 MB Cache, 5400 RPM). But it's not the external drive itself, it's the model of the internal drive that is located inside the external enclosure. So it should definitely fit inside another enclosure with a eSata connector. 

iFixit has a teardown of a Mac Mini. Here you'll find a PDF with disassembly instructions of a Mac Mini. The components are not far from the ones used for laptops: small size, huge integration. 

If you install the 2x 1GB modules in slot DIMM1 and DIMM2, they will run correctly in Single Channel mode. But I'm pretty sure it's not recommended (nor even supported) to have the 2GB modules in DIMM1 and DIMM2, and the 1GB modules in DIMM3 and DIMM4. 

Which WiFi router do you have? For some of them, you can select the emission power. It's possible on the Linksys WRT54G if you install the DD-WRT firmware (I guess other firmwares for the WRT54G can do this too). 

I have a Canon CanoScan LiDE 60 that works fine with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bits. Here is the Microsoft Compatibility page about it. 

You could use this AutoHotkey macro: Volume On-Screen-Display (OSD) -- by Rajat The interesting part is here: 

A standalone setup is available at this location. This is the full version, not an installer that will download the rest. 

Could it be there is a software installed by the manufacturer of the computers that interferes with the new keyboard? Something like an On-Screen-Display software that displays on the screen the status change of the CAPS Lock, NumLock, ... , the volume, ... 

Try to following these interactive Diagnostic Flowsharts. They're great to identify where problems can come. You can click on the rhombuses (identifying a question) to get more information about that question. 

The VMware Virtual Machine Importer can convert several VM formats (and physical disks) to a VMware disk. This includes the VHD format used by VirtualPC. Check the doc here for the supported formats. 

The Rolls-Royce of macro automation is definitely AutoHotkey, well known and used a lot on SuperUser. But you have to type the script by hand. I'm sure others will post less-featured but more easy to use macro recorders. 

There are several AutoHotkey scripts for that. This one for instance: Adjust volume with mouse Or this one: change sound volume by mouse wheel 

but you'd better use a tool for this, like MoveFile from SysInternals, or MoveLatr from BitSum (C source code provided for the latter), which do the registry editing for you. 

It works fine for me on my laptop with Windows XP (using a Mobile Intel 965 Express chipset with integrated graphic card). When I connect the laptop to an external monitor, this monitor becomes the primary and the laptop screen becomes secondary. I suggest you update the graphic card drivers, as it's a feature managed by the drivers. It used not to work correctly for me until an updated driver came out. Otherwise, you could have more luck with the Profiles feature of Ultramon. 

This command will parse the file stored above and run several commands, setting back the saved dates and times to the files. The "|" sign is indicated as being the delimiter for the fields. 

Actually the "couple of beeps" are important. Well, the count of them. Some (most?) motherboards report low-level issues with beeps, as there is nothing else they can use to warn the user something is wrong (some have LEDs too). Too bad actually that the recent computer cases do not ship anymore with a speaker, or that the motherboard do not come with an on-board beeper. Refer to the manual of the motherboard, they should indicate the possible cause of the issue for each number of beeps. This type of diagnostic card is actually great to identify boot issues, as it reports with numbers the step the BIOS goes through when checking the hardware. And it has a speaker in case the case/MB doesn't have one. Helped me once to troubleshoot a computer not booting, it identified an issue with the USB controller. 

Such programs are usually made for a specific brand of BIOS chip. Furthermore, as pointed out in other answers, it's more and more difficult, or even impossible to access the BIOS from the OS. It can also be a cause of instability. 

Assuming your program is called from a Command Prompt, stderr and stdout are by default directed to the console. If you want to save them to a file, you must redirect the output. 

You need a speech recognition software. Several programs exist for that, but I don't know any that can do batch conversion. I'm pretty sure it's a feature of at least one of them though. Note most of them are far from cheap. 

The chipsets are hopefully close enough that it should work without too much problems. It worked for me when I replaced the motherboard of my PC, from an Asus P5B-E (chipset P965) to an Asus P5Q-E (chipset P45). Windows 7 (64-bits Ultimate) took some time to identify the new hardware and install the drivers but, after a reboot, it worked flawlessly. Make sure to have the minimum of external peripherals connected when you restart the PC (except mouse and keyboard), and add them back once at a time after the motherboard devices have been identified and the PC rebooted. 

This is apparently a known issue with Synergy, and even with Synergy+ (a fork with a lot of bugfixes). It's being discussed quite intensively here on the issue tracker for Synergy+. The problem would be that you switch screens (and thus computers) with a special modifier key (Shift, Alt, ...) pressed down. When you release it, the other computer gets the "key up" message, not the one that got the "key down" message initially. So the state of the modifier key is not released. Until they have a fix for this, you'd better not switch screens while pressing one of these keys. 

I guess you mean "Tile vertically or horizontally"? You can use Aero Snap: move 1 window on the left side of the screen and the other windows on the right side of the screen. Both will maximize to half the size of the screen, making it easy to view both at the same time. 

SpinRite from GRC is well known as a disk recovery tool. It will scan all sectors, try to recover the data if possible and mark defective sectors so they're not reused. Worked fine for me in a few occasions. It's not free though: $89.00 

I think what you mean is called "Basic Authentication", where the browser gets a 401 HTTP error code when you try to access a protected page. It then displays the dialog box to the user asking to enter the username and password, and sends back the request to the webserver, encoding the username and password in Base64 in one of the header. 

That's the thermal protection of the CPU going into action: when the CPU gets too hot, it automatically reduces its speed so it doesn't burn out. More information here: 

I don't know how to change the Ribbon bar back to a regular menu. It can be done in Word 2007 with an add-on. No idea if such an add-on exists also for SmartDraw. 

I do not recognize anything pointing to a "marketing version". The website says the current version of Catalyst is 10.2. 

Boot on a LiveCD that support NTFS. I guess most of the Linux live distros can do it (Ubuntu for instance). From Linux, you should be able to browse your Windows disk and delete the rogue directory. 

Resource Hacker is a good resource editor. You might be interested also in ResEdit. It's free and updated regularly. 

For this kind of problem, USB Drive Letter Management (USBDLM) makes wonders. You can allocate drive letters to USB drives, make sure it does not interfere with network drives, ... From their Getting Started section: 

You could maybe add a "glossy look" texture to the Windows 7 taskbar using the Texturized Taskbar tool. 

Isn't there a special character in the name of the directory? Like an "empty" character that looks like a space but is not a space? Have you tried a "Check Disk", as the directory entry for that directory or its parent might be corrupted? 

Have you checked /var/log/audit/audit.log, as explained in this document? I suppose the GNOME applet is sealert, a part of setroubleshoot. 

Applications decide whether to put an icon in the System Tray, what it will look like and its features when it gets an event (mouse click). The System Tray is just a "container" window for icons (to make it short). There is nothing in the Registry nor a folder that contains or describe what the System Tray contains at a specific time. At most, the Registry or .ini files might contain application-specific settings, some of them driving their behavior regarding their eventual system tray icon. 

OggSync is free if you want to sync only 1 Google calendar with Outlook 2007 (and 2003 and 2010). It works in both directions. 

Use the command, running the command to put the computer to sleep. The command doesn't have a sleep parameter. 

Last time I did this, with an ASUS motherboard and Windows 7, the flashing tool crashed in the middle of the flash operation. Bricked motherboard! I had to buy a new motherboard (and I still don't know what to do with the bricked one). I strongly recommend against flashing inside the OS. You'd better use other means: most recent motherboards support flashing from a USB key nowadays. 

That would give you only the thread count. Play with other field specifiers for the "-o" option (see 'man ps') for other info. For instance 

If you click on the arrow next to the folder or drive name, it opens with one click only. But indeed it's much smaller than clicking on the full name. 

Install AutoHotkey, save the code above in a file with the .ahk extension and launch the script. It will wait for the Rename window to appear. When it does, it automatically "clicks" on the Yes button (identified here with "Button1"). If you don't want to install AutoHotkey, here is a compiled version of the same script. Run the executable and watch it do its magic :-) . Note it does not really answer the question, as the question still appears. But it's automated so you'll not be bothered by it anymore. 

Firefox extensions are created using a mix of XUL (XML User Interface Language) and Javascript. You'll find plenty of explanation on the Mozilla Developer Center. 

Try Terminals, it's a remote control tool that supports VNC, RDP, SSH, Telnet, ... It uses the Terminal Services ActiveX Client (mstscax.dll) so I'm not sure it'll solve your issue with mstsc. 

You'll find a nice tutorial here on how to put the install of Windows Server 2003 (and 2000, Server 2000 and XP) on a USB drive. 

With all the efforts they've made improving the boot performance and minimizing the impact of the boot animation, I'd be really surprised they added something as stupid as a timer to wait for the end of the animation. 

The libraries are just a logical view on several folders. Defining a Documents library (whether it contains only 1 directory or more) does not change the default location for the Documents folder. They're 2 different entities for Windows 7. If you want to move the Documents folder to another drive, follow the instructions on this site: How to Change My Documents Folder Default Location Path in Windows 7, Vista and XP 

-c will copy the executable to execute (here pslist.exe) on the remote system. -accepteula accepts automatically the license agreement that is displayed when you run for the 1st time one of the tools. 

Take Command Console LE (TCC LE), a free souped-up replacement for the command prompt, has a command that can change the creation, last modification and last access times and dates for files. It can of course run batch files. The parameters to use are /D (for date) and /T (for time): /D 

You must change the Regional Settings to some English flavor, like "English (United States)" for instance. Some installation program use the regional settings to define which language to use for the installation and/or as default language for the program. If you change to English, you might want to change the time, date and currency format back to the French ones. PS: Bonjour de Belgique! ;-) 

Click on the cell just right of the column and below the row you want to freeze, and select "Freeze Panes". So, if you want to freeze the row 1 and the column A, click on B2 and select "Freeze Panes". If you want to freeze the rows 1 to 3 and the columns A&B, click on C4 and select "Freeze Panes". 

I've had the same issue with Office 2007 when I changed the motherboard. I reactivated Office by calling a special phone number (in my country) and following several steps. After that, it was reactivated again. The procedure is described here. 

You could have a program ping regularly a well-known website that is known to be always available (google.com for instance) and alert you if it is not reachable. FreeMeter has, amongst a lot of features, this functionnality. I think many other programs can do this. 

Install the AutoHide add-on, this will allow you to use the "-fullscreen" parameter on the command-line.
