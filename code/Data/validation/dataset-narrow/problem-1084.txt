Until now I have transferred HDDs with installed Windows 8.1 between different hardware platforms many time and without a single problem. Especially it is very smooth when you are exchanging the platform for the same one (Intel for Intel, AMD for AMD), but actually I have not experienced any issues until now whatsoever. It was the era of Windows XP where changing the platform was a matter of luck, but with Windows 8.1 (even with Windows 7) I didn't have any issues... and I'm running my own computer service, meaning that things like this happens daily Until now, I didn't have any issue with Windows 10 as well And I am very grateful to Microsoft for this, as this saved my life (time and money) 

None of the answers to these questions provide working solutions (as of today) to perform all searches in Chrome's omnibox (the box where you type in the URL) using Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature. Envisioned workflow: 

I am looking for a public RSS feed that informs me about new releases of LibreOffice. Is anyone aware of a respective RSS feed? 

Can LO Writer automatically detect the language in which the current line of text is being composed and based on this automatically change the spell-check language accordingly? 

You can try with Driver Verifier. The Driver Verifier is built-in to the kernel to allow stress testing of driver code. It is to some extent configurable in relation to what functions are bypassed, and what bypasess to perform. It is setup to bypass specific functions to other predetermined functions, which provides an aggressive environment for the target driver. In the Run dialog box type the command "verifier" (w/o quotes) On how to use it check the Knowledge Base article Q244617 Just one note: Once the Driver Verifier manager is enabled, it stays active until you disable it. To do so, type in Run dialog box "verifier /reset" (w/o quotes) 

When creating an index entry via Alt+Shift+X it inserts a code line like this at the current pointer position: 

Especially when I am on laptop battery, I don't want to watch the video on a website (because it consumes a lot of resources and drains down battery) but only its audio. Is it somehow possible to block the video content and only allow the audio content? 

LibreOffice Calc 5.0.4.2 on Ubuntu Linux 15.10 underlines misspelled words but does not display spelling check suggestions. Is there a way to add spelling check suggestions to the right mouse click context menu? 

Some enclosures have a 2.2TB limit simply because the electronics and firmware (USB to SATA bridge) can only address 32-bit LBAs. Even enclosures that support 48bit LBA, doesn't necessarily support HDDs larger than 2.2TB, simply because the rest of electronics doesn't support 48bit LBA. If you want to be on a safe side, look for an enclosure with 48bit LBA support that is explicitly tested by the manufacturer for 4TB HDDs. Also avoid enclosures with JMicron chip as it is known by poor performance 

Alternatively, you can use ApexSQL Script, as it will allow you to script not only the object you want, but it can include all the dependant objects in the final script. It is even possible to combine multiple SQL databases and extract SQL objects from multiple SQL databases at once. You can read more about this in the Create DDL and DML SQL scripts for specific SQL database objects only article. Output will be an .sql file which can be edited quickly with any text editor Disclaimer: I'm working for ApexSQL as a Technical Support Engineer 

I have free access to academic literature through the library system of my institution. Let me briefly describe my current workflow. 

In Google Sheets, I can compose a formula as follows to easily mirror data from one sheet tab into another: 

I am using Chrome's "Person" feature to keep my private profile separate from my work profile. However, it takes me three steps to switch between the profiles. Is there any way how I can switch between two profiles more quickly (i.e. a single click)? 

If I click then on to create an index table the entry is recognised and included into the index table. However, if I simply manually write this code line it is not recognised as an index entry. What magic is happening here? 

SIMM modules are with twice less pins than DIMM modules, which allows DIMM to utilize the wider 64-bit bus, versus the 32-bit bus in case of SIMM. It is actually possible to achieve 64-bit bus using the two SIMMs as well, by using these in a tandem configuration, but DIMMs eliminated the need for this. Quite often there is misunderstanding of the memory module's rank term, by putting the equation sign between the rank and PCB or between the rank and side. In fact, two sided module could be single or dual ranked, depending of data width of the DRAM chips (x4 or x8) 

When searching through the Chrome omnibox, I would like to increase the number of search results shown. Is this possible? Please take the following example as a reference: 

However, is it also possible to directly embed an image into the document to share the Markdown document with the image file directly contained inside it? 

I observed that some websites that use a Google Account login, such as ShoutEngine or Zendesk, log me out of the session after a certain while of inactivity. Is there any way to configure my default web browser Google Chrome to prevent this logout and constantly remain logged in? With extensions such as Staying Alive I can keep the session active during the same browser session. However, as soon as I restart my machine and reopen Chrome, I need to login again. Are there any solutions to this? 

Go for the WinSock XP Fix utility as it might solve your issue. When selling computers, I'm usually installing Avast! AV and WinSock XP helped mi numerous times to fix the XP issue when Avast! blocking browser HTTP access, so it may do the job for you as well. I'm not sure what changes this tool made, but it worked almost every time :) 

What you see in ViewPower is not reliable information. These cheap UPS doesn't have reliable internal monitoring of battery status and it is basically based on battery voltage, rather than having the circuit that can test battery capacity via charging and discharging currents and voltage drop delta. To sum up: 

With Google Chrome, is there any way to automatise the above process so that for certain pages (such as ScienceDirect), Chrome automatically uses the proxy URL with my stored credentials? 

How can I prevent Chrome from terminating on closing the last opened tab? Instead of terminating, I want Chrome to always display a blank open tab. 

You can quickly switch between different "Chrome Persons" by performing a right mouse click on the name of the "Chrome Person" that is displayed in the top right. 

I prefer the way how Mac OS X allows users to use touchpad gestures to scroll back and forth in the tab history of Google Chrome. Is it possible to use similar touchpad gestures on non-Mac OS X devices, particularly laptops running Google Chrome on Linux? 

I'm not sure how you will enter the custom logo, but I can help you to make the HP recovery partition visible 

This actually depends on the Realtek HD audio chip used in your audio card. For laptops it is usually 16bit/48KHz maximum, but for chips used in the MoBos it is usually 16bit/192KHz maximum With some good audio cards like Creative, Asus etc. you can get 24bit/192KHZ recording quality You can easily check the properties of the recorded audio after you test record something 

I'm on 2013 at the moment but I think that this should work in 2007 and 2010 versions. Though I am not sure whether the steps below renders the 2007 or 2010 version... long time ago that was :)
