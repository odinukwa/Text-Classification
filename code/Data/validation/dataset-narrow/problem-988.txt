and parse the result to get the exact PID (if you know the exact commandline ,process name or pid it will be easy). In this cases it convenient to start a process and get it's pid immediately. 

All linked scripts can be downloaded and saved with whatever name you find convenient. 1) The IEXPRESS solution - as arguments accepts only the command and its arguments. Example usage: 

you'll need blat.exe whick most used tool for sending mails via batch scripts sleep should be built-in windows 7. But this will work only if you have only one java.exe running... You can use some external tools to start a process and its PID for maximum usability 

2) SCHTASKS - Again accepts only two arguments - the command and the arguments.Also checks if it's started with elevated permissions and if possible gets the PID of the process with WEVTUTIL command. Example usage: 

you can get detailed information about running process. you can be more specific with something like: 

this will print the resolutions of all monitors. Edit. The accepted answer uses WMIC. ().This will not work on windows8/8.1/10. For the newer windows versions this can be used: 

3) 'WScript.Shell' - the script is full wrapper of 'WScript.Shell' and every possible option can be set through the command line options.It's a jscript/batch hybrid and can be called as a bat. Example usage (for more info print the help with '-h'): 

Using will startled most of the anti-virus programs and there are some versions of windows that come without media player. Here's a way with shell.application and invokeVerb function: save this with extension: 

You might need one additional call of on the remote machine to get exact location of the directory. something like this: 

5) The .NET solution . Most of the options of ProcessStartInfo options are used (but at the end I was too tired to include everything).Should return the PID but it does not: Example usage (for more info print the help with '-h'): 

it can be done without external tools (you just need installed .net framework ,which is installed by default on everything from vista and above) - screenCapture.bat. It is a selfcompiled C# program and you can save the output in few formats and capture only the active window or the whole screen: 

4) 'Win32_ProcessStartup' - again full wrapper and all options are accessible through the command line arguments.This time it's WSF/batch hybrid with some Jscript and some VBScript pieces of code - but it returns the PID of the started process.If process id not hidden some options like X/Y coordinates can be used. Example usage (for more info print the help with '-h').This will require the full path to the executable/script if it is not in the : 

Click on the error message with alert sign, then press shift +f10 takes you to cmd, type the following in order diskpart list disk sel disk # (number that appears to be your hard disk) clean convert gpt 

Then exit. Reboot. Most likely you will get an error sign..! Something in line with secure booting. This video will entail which setting to fix on BIOS with no problem. This has been the worst crack of my short life of understanding computers. But all is well now - or so it is just the beginning.;) 

I have SK hynix CANVAS 512 GB |ONFI DDR NAND Flash Adopted | SATA3 6.0 Gbpsat hand. It failed to be recognized or partitioned using Mac OS Disk Utility and Windows 10. Result of my google search has led me to believe that Windows 7 installation to use the feature as the only solution. So I installed and it is recognized on BIOS, tried: 

This post basically resolves the question - with a little bit more tips. Hard to explain my steps as I have made efforts sporadically, to release the heat on my head.. Basically need to use the tools provided by the motherboard's company. In my case, MSI and its smart tool. Requires patching of drivers, which will show up on the menu at the bottom with checkboxes when you burn the ISO file to boot USB. In booting, BIOS set should not be LEGACY (as commonly known) but UEFI with C--. It still requires you to convert the disk to GPT as the current setting doesn't support installation of windows 7. With my ignorance and inexperience, was lucky to get support from the blog writer, so will share here for the beginners' guide to whoever happen to encounter the same issue. 

Can someone kindly save me.. I just want to make sure this SSD is workable or not, then I can decide whether to throw it or give it to someone. Maybe it is safe to determine this SSD is rotten? Wow I spent so much time installing windows 7. 

I installed Windows 10 multiple times because the auto-setup of drivers using the CD that comes with the package did not clean-install a lot of fronts. Then I encountered a major problem with ssd initialization, which was discussed to have been resolved by some of the people online through windows 7 if 10 or mac OS did not help the issue. Confirmed further by MS technician who are commented below as overworked and ignorant but yes, they agreed after their own online searches. Learned on the way that MSI provides smart tool which didnt' work well. So I somehow have to modify my ISO file on usb to make the motherboard recognize the installation files. Link. On my way to doing this now. Based on this document that explains how to path driver.. I thought the first option wouldn't work for Windows 10 (which I'm running on now) but since the second option didn't work in the past or I didn't understand well enough, better give it a shot. This video is relevant out of my search, but before this step, I'm told to 'Download SATA/RAID drivers from the manufacturer, put them on USB and when windows asks for the missing driver just browse to the files on the USB. Make sure you unzip them before hand' may be what I'm working on after all. This has cost so many people their time and feeling of worthlessness/frustration, according to my search. 

It looks like some of your system files are broken. You can try to: run cmd.exe as Administrator, then type sfc /scannow and wait for the process to complete. Hope this helps. 

No, it is not necessary for the flash drive to be FAT to be bootable but as it stands now most devices are able to recognize natively FAT32 format be it your droid,tv or something else. However you can boot from any format as long as your bootloader recognizes it. Took this from here: $URL$ I think myself that your bootloader does not recognise the format. Or maybe there is boot mode in your bios that needs to be properly set. Because i tried myself making a NTFS bootloader for Win7 Pro 64bit and it worked out fine. 

=DOLLAR - is a function that converts the following number into current currency (i suspect from country you are or your account is) MOD(dividend;divider) - is a value that is returned after your "dividend" was divided with "divider" for example: 5 divide 2 you have 1 is left undivided and 4 divide 2 you have 0 left undivided then goes: (4 / "value in cell A1") / 7+ MOD(19[dividend]MOD(value in A1[dividend], 19[divider])-7,30[divider]) and this returned number is multiplied by * 14%,) after all calculations the value is multiplied x 7 and is substructed by -6 in the end I think that was helpfull, because i am not very good in such english explanations. =) 

This will create a new entry in registry that should disable the Lock Screen in Windows 10. If you want the lock screen on again, just change the "1" to "0" I have taken it from here: $URL$ Note on Disabling the Windows 10 Login Screen & Password Prompt On a related note, it is possible to disable the Windows 10 login screen so that you don't have to enter a password after booting your PC, but that subject would warrant a separate tutorial, and it comes with one big downside: If you disable the password prompt and login screen on Windows 10, you'll lose the ability to sync settings and data across all of your Windows devices. Hopefully this process becomes a bit more stable in future builds, and we'll cover it at that time. (Did not tested this myself) 

I currently need to find a regedit entry so i can disable libre office 5 auto-updates. Does anyone has a sollution? OS: Windows 7 64x professional. 

This file is not a virus. It deletes "svchost.exe" file only, and tries to perform task(delete) if this file still exists. 

This will create a 1 - 26 values in the row where you will place the formula. Hope that will help you.
