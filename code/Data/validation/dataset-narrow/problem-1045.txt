The instructions I followed are on my windows partition so I can't say exactly (yet at least) how I did it, but I remember starting with OSX, partitioning everything up ahead, then installing BootCamp/Windows. After that I installed Mint and then finally Debian. Debian has always been my default (master) boot loader and I would like to return to that. I don't want to use rEFIt/rEFInd or Clover or anything else. Journaling and csrutil are disabled for what it is worth... If I mount /dev/disk0s1 under /Volumes/EFI, I see that it looks the same, 

where astralinuxce is Debian. I have never had luck with BCDedit and I do have this $URL$ on usb, but I would like some guidance before I do anything. I understand linux boot fairly well, but not really windows or OSX... I can repost on pastebin or something the output of the linked software. Booting into OSX, says no problem. I'll note that this is 1.0.3 while the one from Linux Mint install was 1.0.1... But, I do note that and don't agree, though I think that may be normal?? 

and so I wonder if I should permanently apply this 'rule'? using the '-D' flag...? EDIT Just noticed this problem too: 

It's not a F/OSS solution, but this software does exactly what you want, and has lots of configuration options to support most situations: $URL$ The basic concept is that you install Gsync on your client computer where you run Outlook. You configure it with your Gmail login and it will create a two way sync between Outlook and Gmail. Then Gmail will be effective hub between your phone and your desktop. 

Check out github too - you can import a project from SVN using github and do it online on their servers (as long as it's a public project it's free). This isn't mirroring and you have to use git not SVN but maybe worth checking out.. 

I've also read that possibly restarting in safe mode and editing the file might work. This seems like hokum to me, but since I saw it in several threads, I'd pass it along. Finally try changing localhost in the hosts file and see if that makes any difference to be able to ping localhost? If not, then it would seem you're not messing with the right file? Or the file you're messing with is being ignored b/c your IP stack is not looking for any hosts file.. Hope this helps. 

Seems to not find either linux partition (mint on sda6 or debian on sda8), though the debian bootloader boots either just fine. Running a "deeper search"... I don't understand why doesn't seem to complain, yet does. I should also add some more info I found others had requested from similar problems (my OSX is 10.11.6 on a MacBook Pro 11,3): 

but .... update Booted into OSX Installation Media and ran from terminal, and and finally got some "loader" space after my OSX partition - right between OSX & its recovery - not sure how it disappeared... Also backed up partition info with and then converted "hybrid" to "protective" using gdisk, then ran in the running linux OS. Then made sure I could boot from Linux Mint & Mac OSX. Now reinstalling BootCamp and see about doing an "in place" reinstall of windows 10. Already ordered a new computer that will be just for windows - if it wasn't for certain software I need.... Anyways I think I'll close this pretty soon as there is evidently no ideas out there, nor from me either. update Finished the "in place" reinstall of Windows 10. Now both boot successfully (and the OSX recovery) though the recovery complains of a lack of for OSX. This was fixed from the OSX install media - so the only one to blame is Windows 10. I'll try to boot into the Bootcamp Windows Installer, shrink the windows partition, and then fix the loader space with the MacOSX installer again... update So I rand from the BootCamp Windows 10 Installer (had to make the USB drive again from BC - showed up with more 'buttons' this time...oh well) and shrunk the Windows 10 OS partition. Said it would shrink the tail end but I wanted space in front of it so I then booted into a live usb of Gparted and only moved it - effectively putting the space to the front instead of behind. Of course I knew this would probably ruin windows 10 and I could not boot into Win 10, nor could BC Win 10 installation fix it. So I booted into OSX Installation media and ran and from the terminal and, maybe due to the size not changing, I could boot into OSX or Win 10 (alt key) after I set the to Windows. Then I just reinstalled Debian's bootloader, which of course (haha) found Linux Mint. So now it is all back to normal, minus the need to install about 5 hours worth of software - but that will be for a different machine. Need to get comfy with cloning partitions, and maybe whole disks... Will probably close this soon. 

My computer is periodically bogged down by disk activity that I've tracked down to files of an usual type. The symptom is that my computer UI bogs down (mouse stutters, UI buttons lag, etc). While this is going on, in the Resource Monitor I can see high disk activity (the heavy disk use seems to be the source of the slow OS/UI). This whole situation happens only every once in a while. The files that Resource Mon lists as associated with the high level of disk activity are randomly named but always in the form "[letters/numbers].exe.part" and are located in my temp folder. One that I noticed today is 2FQgISac.exe.part. There seems to be only one of these files active at a time. At first I thought it was a virus or something but I right clicked on the file in explorer and examined its properties -- it is a digitally signed file from Microsoft! So that rules out most of kind of viruses? Obviously I've googled for this but I can't find anything relevant. Does anyone know what this is, whether there's a way to get it to stop bogging my user interface and/or any other thoughts or suggestions on how to get my computer back to normal? It seems like this issue has cropped up in the last 30 days for me and I've uninstalled any software I've put on the computer in that time but that hasn't helped.. Thanks for any assistance! 

EDIT 2 I tried the two commands above and they work fine - on my OS's partition. The problems are when I move to a different partition, with the working Linux Mint on it and the pdf files I want to modify, that these commands fail. Both partitions are ext4, both have the same username, hostname, UID/GID, permissions, etc. 

Anyway, following this nice explanation, $URL$ I installed the "Russian, Macintosh" keyboard layout (and all Russian and Ukrainian language support). I then verified the keycode 51 to backslash using . Luckily all I had to do was replace, in , 

I then verified it with . As it turns out, now I have two keys for the character, but I could easily replace the wrong one with the square bracket "]", but I personally don't care about that. I'll wait a while to see if someone wants to post a better answer, but if not, eventually I'll edit this out and mark this answer. 

where these two matched - not sure if this is definitive in knowing the real values... I know I could maybe use but I don't think it is necessary (it's kind of a "big gun" right?) The only partition it didn't find was swap - it was just off a little, so I selected "A" to add it in. Don't know the difference between "Linux Swap" or "Linux Swap 2" but I just picked the first one as I usually make temporary swap files myself from either of the 2 linux partitions (I don't bother adding to fstab, etc.). Haven't rebooted yet but has no complaints. Also used an old Win 7 machine to make a recovery USB for the Win 10. Hope that goes smoothly... Update Well that might have been a good thing or not.... Rebooted with a black screen - nothign. So held down option and went to OSX Recovery (OSX would still work, Windows would still not work) and ran from gui - all is good. Ran repair and verify from terminal - an error that could not be fixed - was something about needing more trailing space for the OSX (disk0s2/sda2) partition and wanting to shrink it - failed - despite me enabling journaling etc. Tried this with same outcome from installation media. Figured why not try and work on windows so booted into recovery USB (from the ) and it couldn't fix the "start up" issues. So dropped to and tried and friends. worked, complained of "access denied". So reinstalled from Debian (sda8) onto the front of the disk (sda), checked partitions - they were all in agreement, and effectively back to where I was, along with judicious and ample use of various and friends. I did compile NTFS-3g (wanted the latest in this attempt but did not ) and ran on sda4 (BOOTCAMP) and it said good things; 

Thanks indeed to Microsoft for eliminating "Restore Previous Versions". However, if you have system protection enabled on your system drive (usually C:) you can STILL get to the old versions back. Just because they took away the UI doesn't mean they took away the underlying backups. First off, download Shadow Explorer. Then bow at their feet for writing it. $URL$ After installing it, you can navigate to the files referenced in the accepted answer by Mark Sowul. Note that you select the date/version you want to browser with the pulldown in shadow explorer: 

Check out Greasemonkey - it can almost certainly handle your task, but you'll have to write some javascript to accomplish it: $URL$ This script looks like it's close to what you want: $URL$ And here's a discussion about how to detect text within a span in html, which would get you the other half of your functionality: $URL$ So you'd want to use the text detection code in 2940 with the auto-reload of 34287. 

I have a single Windows 10 machine. It is not connected to a domain. Pretty stock. Daylight savings time changed this weekend, and my computer is not showing the correct time. I've rebooted it with no change in the issue. If I set "Adjust for daylight savings time automatically" then the time is wrong. If I turn this feature off, then the time is right. It seems like the opposite should be true. Can someone help me to get my OS to report the correct time throughout the year? Screenshots to demo the problem to follow.. Time is wrong when "Adjust automatically" is set: 

I usually delete my questions when I find an answer, if no one has responded. Also, there are many keyboard type questions online, but I did not find anything specific to (not saying these are unique); 

I'd still like to learn a little by fixing this quad-boot. First of all, how do I find out what is wrong? I know the symptoms but gdisk has no complaints... Where do I start? I can only access Linux Mint & Debian (sda6 & sda8) from bootloader (on sda, installed from Debian). Windows (says it's on sda1, but its installed on sda4) just sits and does nothing. If I type exit at grub command line I can go straight to OSX. If I hold down Option key I get OSX, OSX Recovery and Windows, of which only first 2 work. This seems to have started when I had to reinstall my Franken-Debian (well not too bad, just thought it would be easier than fixing it - 2 branches in sources.list is all) (sda8) and now I wonder if I installed it not in UEFI mode... Is this possible? If I select Windows it just sits forever. Here is my partitions; 

I'm used to using 'ls' as I would in Linux Mint, e.g. 'ls *.pdf', but in this Debian variant 'ls .pdf' complains. I find myself using a length 'find -maxdepth 1 -type f -name ".pdf" -print' instead. Reading this: ls working strangely did not help too much. I do have bash_completions package and I have no weird aliases for 'ls' in my '~/.bashrc' file - I never edit the '/etc/profile' or the global one, wherever it is. Just guessing, I did apply the solution in the linked question but it didn't work. I don't fully understand 'complete' - I guess it is part of 'readline' - so maybe a short explanation would help too (It has no 'man' page). This works though: 'complete -p ls *.pdf', which 'complete --help' says, 

Are you sure that your IP stack has the hosts file enabled? I recall that by policy it could be disabled, which is a security feature. Scratch installs of Win7 have it enabled, I believe, but it's possible if you're using a corporate machine that it's been disabled and you'll need to re-enable it - I think this is done through the Network control panel as an admin. You sound like you're very computer literate, so don't take offense, but here is another common error: 

I think you want keyconfig. There appears to be a version available for FF5: $URL$ More info here: $URL$ XPI here: $URL$ Fair warning, I haven't tried to get keyconfig working in FF5. But I have used a version of keyconfig with older versions of FF as well as with Thunderbird and it does what you want: lets you remap key configurations to suit your preferences. 

On my current Windows 7 install (relatively stock from Lenovo) I cannot click-and-drag on a maximized window and drag it onto my second monitor. On my older computer (another Lenovo laptop w/Win7 -in the same laptop family) I could do this. I'm sure there's some Windows config/registry setting that enables "detaching and dragging" of maximized windows when click/dragging on the title bar of a window, but I can't find it on Google or here. Thanks for any info or ideas! 

But when I, in grub, , I see the partitions under (hd1,gpt1), (hd1,gpt2), etc. but if I change it it still doesn't work. I know grub notation is a little differnt than grub2, and hd_ seems more grub than grub2, but I am mostly going off what says, and that grub2 is installed on both... update Running off a live Linux Mint cd with wired internet, I installed testdisk and ran it. It seems to only say TestDisk 7.0, Data Recovery Utility, April 2015 Christophe GRENIER $URL$ 

I can access the windows 10 partition from OSX and that seems fine... If I edit the grub command for Windows (Debian's) I see its entry; 

I note that the EFI partition seems to have the right code, and starts at sector 40. I'm unsure yet as to whether report about the MBR, header and table are fine - I think so. As Debian was my main bootloader, and I hadn't touched Windows10 in months, I'm hoping to regain bootability of all 4 if maybe I reinstall Debian... After the deepscan in , the 'partitions' listed that cannot be recovered are many, but I do note that the Linux Mint (sda6) partition (for example) that is listed in is also unrecoverable by and "P" says that the filesystem is not supported - so not sure I should trust ...? Update Well I went through with the "deep scan", picking all that were valid (though I'll note it couldn't "read" some of the partitions as it was not supported apparently?) - valid from and another link I found on this site $URL$ 

My thinkpad t410s has a feature that I can set the min charge level before recharging. I've got it set at 90%, so the battery has to drain down to at least 90% before it will recharge. My old T43 would charge whenever the battery level dropped to 99% and this has made the battery basically useless at this point (30% it's original charge capability). Most battery manufacturers (li-on) also recommend that you discharge the battery fully about once a month, if you use it every day. This will help (I'm not sure why) to maintain a healthy battery. NiCad bats required this treatment more regularly, but Li-On bats also need it sometimes, apparently. 

The best tool I'm aware of for analyzing and fixing low level problems in the dos/windows formats & environments is: $URL$ If it doesn't resolve the issue you probably have a hardware failure on your hands. I'd highly, highly recommend backing up anything/everything you can before you run any analysis/recovery software. In my experience with hardware failures they get worse and worse the more the disk runs, so you have a limited amount of time that the drive is on to get stuff off.. DO NOT write anything to the disk - read/backup stuff off it only. Then try spinrite to see if you can fix things that way. Sometimes it's just a bad sector that crops up and that doesn't compromise the whole disk..
