To run multiple REG files and enter registry data - I currently use RegFileMerger to combine the REG files into one .REG file. This works, but it does NOT display any error information if any of the combined REG files fails. How can I add error checking to a combined multiple REG file to report any errors and identify which REG file entries are NOT working or PAUSE and identify which REG file does NOT work. 

The following Powershell script is supposed to process all designated images INSIDE the specified Rootfolder. Some of the renamed output images are generated OUTSIDE the Rootfolder. Any Powershell gurus have any idea why? How can I output files only in the Rootfolder and not OUTSIDE the Rootfolder? 

You could use the DOS REPLACE command REPLACE [d:][path]filename [d:][path][/A][/P][/R][/S][/U][/W] Purpose: Replaces stored files with files of the same name from a different storage location. This command replaces files in the target path designation with files of the same name in the source location. You can use wildcard characters (? and *) to indicate groups of filenames in the source directories. You CANNOT use this command to replace hidden files or system files. Options /A - Adds files specified by the source path designation that DO NOT exist on the target path designation. By using this option, you can selectively add files to a directory: a file in the source path designation that has the same name as a file on the target designation will not be affected. This option cannot be used in combination with the /S option. /P - Displays a prompt before each file is replaced allowing you to decide on a file-by-file basis whether or not to allow the replacement. /R - Replaces both read-only and unprotected files on the target directory. Without this option, any attempt to REPLACE a read-only file will result in an error message and the replacement process will terminate. /S - Acts both on the target directory and all subdirectories within the target directory. You cannot use the /A option together with this option. /U - Replaces files on the target drive or directory that are older than their counterparts on the source drive. /W - Waits for you to insert a disk before starting the replacement process. Examples replace *.dat a: /u The "/u" is very important. It means "update" and tells the replace command to only copy those source files which (a) are also found in the destination directory and which (b) are newer than their counterparts in the destination directory. You can also use replace to copy only those files which do not exist in the destination directory -- that is, only new files. For example: replace *.dat a: /a This is interpreted as 'copy to the a: drive all files in the current directory with a ".dat" extension that are not already present in the a: drive. To maintain an up-to-date back up copy of all files in a given hard disk directory, then, you can use the following pair of replace commands together: replace c:\india a:\india /u replace c:\india a:\india /a 

the weird thing is, if I immediately try to play something after closing the message, it works. I thought it might be a dodgy connection somewhere, but I checked everything and it's still happening. I've also experienced a similar issue with YouTube, the audio will suddenly stop and I have to refresh the page to get it back. This started happening in the past couple of days, but I can't think of anything I've done that could have caused it (not messed around with audio drivers or anything). Audio is coming straight from my AMD Radeon HD 6950 (I don't have a separate sound card) via HDMI into my monitor. Anyone know what could be causing me to momentarily lose audio? 

I recently bought an SSD and installed Windows 7 on it, however it didn't install exactly how I intended - it still requires my HDD to be plugged in to boot onto the SSD. Hopefully the following image explains my situation a bit better. My SSD is the C: drive, and the old HDD is D: - this drive has a 100MB partition which contains the boot sector that requires the HDD for booting into Windows. 

I'm having problems with my wireless connection; I'm able to connect to the router fine (and I get full signal strength), but whenever I try to connect to a web page (or the router configuration page) it times out. It is the same in all browsers (Chrome, Firefox and IE) and results are the same even entering in the IP address manually. I am using a Surf USB Wireless Micro Adapter which I tried in my Windows 8 laptop (from the same location as my PC) where it worked fine. Furthermore, I can access the internet fine on my PC using an ethernet connection. The output of for the wireless connection is: 

I've used tracert to check the connection between my PC and Google's DNS (8.8.4.4) and got the following: 

All to no avail. I'm all out of ideas, so any help is very much appreciated. My thoughts on the issue is that I'm connected to the internet okay, but for some reason the connection is really slow (causing the timeouts). This shouldn't be the case, as I've mentioned other devices connect to the internet fine, and my dongle works fine in my laptop. I have noticed that I am occasionally able to send and receive Facebook messages (using chat) on my PC using WiFi, but actually loading a web page takes too long and times out. 

From what I've found out, booting from the Windows 7 install DVD and running startup repair will resolve the issue. However, as every situation is different (and I'm particularly paranoid I'll somehow brick my system), I wanted to be sure this was correct. So, what's the best way to get my SSD to boot without requiring the HDD to be present? 

I noticed that when I'm seeding a torrent (using Transmission, the default client under Ubuntu), it regularly connects to other seeds, to which, obviously, I won't send any data. People I know have reported that they see the same behaviour using other torrent clients. 

These connections appear during a few seconds, and then vanish. Most of the time they are incoming connections, but I think I saw some outgoing ones once or twice. Why are these seed-to-seed connections made? The only reason that makes sense to me is that they are used to maintain the DHT. 

I have the burg bootloader currently installed on my mbr (+ the following sectors), and I would like to install it on the boot partition, and replace the mbr with a simple one that will boot the partition marked as active ("boot" flag in some partitioning tools). Although I know enough programming to write in assembly a bootsector that will find the first active partition and load it, I'd rather use an existing one. Where could I find such a bootsector? Maybe the default windows bootsector does that? Why I want to do that I have a tool on windows (3DS Max) that consistently breaks the burg bootloader each time it is run. Apparently, it includes an "anti-piracy" software called FlexNet that tags your copmputer to say "hey, 3DS Max was installed here, unfortunately it writes that information in one of the 63 sectors following the bootsector, and burg is installed there (I would call such behavior either "malware" or a "critical bug"). Recent versions of grub now detect when the application has broken your boot, and use different sectors, but burg (a graphical variant of grub) lacks that patch. I have therefore decided to install burg on the boot partition, mark that partition as active, and just ave a single-sector bootloader, that will find the active partition and boot it (PC bootsectors used to do just that in the good ol' times). 

I would like to change some settings (not the disk's contents) for the snapshot "After install", for example change the amount of RAM from 1Gb to 2Gb. How can I do that apart from creating a new child snapshot of "After install" named, e.g. "After install - 2Gb RAM"? It seems to me that virtualbox closely couples VM configuration snapshots with disk snapshots, in a needless way. Back when I used QEMU, I could change the settings for each run while still using the same snapshot: 

I can't use when non-root to swicth from to and vice-versa, although I'm sure the password is OK since I use it to connect via ssh, and the keyboard layout seems to be OK. Also, the command does not seem to work. When connecting as userone to connect works:
