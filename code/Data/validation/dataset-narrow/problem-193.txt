where is file which contains your table structure and data being inserted to it.For various other options of use If you only wants the structure of your tables then write Command as 

First: Make sure that the owner of and its files and subdirectories is user of group to do that run the following command: 

You can try below procedure first test it on local before going to production. This consider that user has unique I have taken that as scored_at Table Structure 

And one more thing in your insert you are missing value for one column, as you have 17 columns to insert but you are inserting only 16 values. I hope you are missing value for column , Your insert should be like below 

I have a query with execution plan as below and is taking more than 20 seconds to execute how can i optimize it 

It may give result as you desired. For Reference have a look at How to Get a List of Permissions of MySQL Users. 

Does the approach i am going to opt will work and is it optimized way to go. Because we don't want any issues in servers (Like slave lag) due to deletions. What would be the best approach to do it without issues and downtime. How can i use pt-archiver for doing this. 

A temporal database is a database with built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model and a temporal version of Structured Query Language. More specifically the temporal aspects usually include valid-time and transaction-time. These attributes go together to form bitemporal data. 1.Valid time denotes the time period during which a fact is true with respect to the real world. 2.Transaction time is the time period during which a fact is stored in the database. 3.Bitemporal data combines both Valid and Transaction Time. UPDATE Firstly i am removing that part which i have added previously as MySQL5.1 and its above versions of MySQL does not support .have a look at This Link.But in My Opinion what the was doing the is capable of Doing all. As BDB is not supported anymore By MySQL.But the InnoDB is able to do all which the BDB was doing. For More Information About temporal database have a look at This. With MySQL, The unavailability of ,, and some limits on , make it harder to build in MySQL. CHECK CONSTRAINT A CHECK CONSTRAINT is often of the form CHECK( [NOT] EXISTS( select_expression )) MySQL implements foreign key constraints in INNODB tables, but does not yet implement CHECK CONSTRAINT. Until it does, such constraints must be enforced by other means. That has onerous consequences for time-valid tables. Some time-valid constraints can be enforced in triggers, but most of the temporal constraints we will consider cannot. Until MySQL implements CHECK CONSTRAINT, they must be enforced in application code. That is a heavy penalty. Deferred constraints MySQL does not yet implement deferred constraints, either. Furthermore, constraints are applied row-wise rather than at COMMIT time. This raises a problem for many complex constraints, even for some simple ones. For example to delete a MySQL row which refers to itself via a foreign key, you must temporarily SET foreign_key_checks = 0. A transaction fulfilling a complex constraint must leave the database in a consistent state.But there is nothing in relational database theory to suggest that a database should be in a consistent state after each statement within a transaction. Triggers MySQL 5 triggers cannot issue UPDATE statements on the trigger table, and cannot raise errors. These limitations create difficulties for implementing transaction validity in MySQL, but the difficulties can be overcome. 

The MainDB.res is not the Actual database.Someone by mistake have created it in your data directory. Have a look at the content of my datadir 

You can create secondary indexes on slave whenever required. There is no issue in creating secondary indexes . If you create and on slave there will be chances that your replication will fail with on slave. Take a example I have a table on master without having any index on it and has following structure and data 

and now when i want to acess it in the MySQL Shell see the result(The world.res is created as #mysql50#world.res by itself. ) 

Once i also faced the same issue i was generating a csv whose size was approximately supposed to 17GB.I found a work around for that why not use which is more powerful and fast. for generating csv using you can do like this 

Now you can login MySQL using password. This is not the most secure way to change password for better approach please have a look at How to Reset the Root Password. 

I know i can tune by setting it to some low value The default value is as below, but i have a single table involve in query so i don't think will help. 

A file of 4 MB should not take 4 minutes to insert.I see your table have InnoDB engine. I hope you first need to optimize basic InnoDB settings for that please have a look at Innodb Performance Optimization Basics Now How to speed up InnoDB Inserts There's an entire document dedicated to bulk loading data into InnoDB. The main points: 

Use in dumps. Dump with format so you can use , which is faster than . Import with multiple threads, one for each table. Use a different database engine if possible. importing into a heavily transactional engine like innodb is awfully slow. Inserting into a non-transactional engine like MyISAM is much much faster. Turn off foreign key checks and turn on auto-commit. If you are importing to innodb the single most effective thing you can do is to put in your my.cnf, temporarily while the import is running. you can put it back to 1 if you need ACID 

I have a correlated sub query, which is taking 16 Minutes to execute how can i convert it to join or optimize it. 

Yes. If you want to import the structure of the Database on some other machine there are some steps as follows 1.on Machine A(generate the dump without the data) 

I am not able to relate at this point why the session settings have been changed as I already changed the value using SET GLOBAL. 

Please also have a look at Forcing InnoDB Recovery. UPDATE : For your comment how to progress on that so that it would not happen again You should not kill MySQL it is not a good practice that may cause MySQL server to crash,whenever you make any configuration changes you should proceed as follows. 

Can Anybody please tell How to handle the Scenario.It is on one of the Production Server. EDIT RAM is of 7GB. And InnoDB Configuration in my.cnf are 

Above shows that all privileges are granted to myuser on all databases.Now grant privileges for single db. 

You can't actually revoke USAGE, without dropping the user.USAGE is a global level privilege. have a look at This Link. 

disable autocommit to avoid an extra log flush for each insert statement: SET autocommit=0;...sql import;COMMIT; disable foreign and unique checks (you can't disable all indexes completely): SET unique_checks=0; SET foreign_key_checks=0; 

You need to specify every column by your self. Example : Table Country and City both have a name column 

2.copy the database_structure.sql on Machine B Then you want to restore its structure on Machine B do 3. Then you have database structure available on the Machine B. try it.. 

When you install MySQL from binaries you need to create mysql group and user. The apt installation of the MySQL package on linux itself creates a mysql user and a group of the same name. While installing MySQL from binaries It s required for security reasons. You want to give a permission to user which will use the . And you also give the permission on i.e which is default in , because your database files are stored there by default. 

You need to grant the Execute Permission to that user.For that you need to login as root user and grant the permission as 

I have installed MySQL 5.7.20 on CentOS 7.4 , I see the mysql service is getting stopped automatically every 2 -3 minutes , I am able to start in manually and again it gets stopped every 2-3 minute. 

I have tried a lot of indexes on table but nothing is being used , its killing the complete server , query is even not able to complete in 10 mins Below is the table structure for even I tried with MEMORY engine as well. 

Yes It is possible that your username is an empty string but it is not safe to create the users like this. For creating and granting privileges in brief have a look at This Link. Yes you can grant all the privileges on all entities within a database. for this you can execute a command like 

The MySQL Performance Schema is a feature for monitoring MySQL Server execution at a low level. The Performance Schema is available as of MySQL 5.5.3. From MySQL Manual there are some of the features of the performance_schema database. 

The issue am facing is that when i am changing the from above to some other location by changing from and then restarting the server but the error log is not getting generated and servers starts successfully. EDIT After restarting the server the value of the above variable get changed. but i didn't found the error log in that location. 

I have used variable in procedure because,I can pass no of records which i target to delete. Sample call statement 

You're getting this error because you're trying to update a row to table that does not have a valid value for the field based on the values currently stored in table. If you post some more code someone can help you diagnose the specific cause. 

For logging slow queries do like below, It will log all queries those are not using indexes as well as which are taking more than 1 sec 

If you don't have privileges to DROP table you should DELETE in chunks. Use MySQL Limit clause to delete in chunks. 

For your reference i am trying to explain some concepts also. Key hit rate There are basically two forms of key hit rate 1.Key Read Efficiency 

What may the issue behind this.? when I created a table with the same structure as this table and inserted the record then the select query is showing result OK. 

I can increase the value of accordingly. I will first test how much time DELETE with LIMIT 5000 takes if it is Ok (Means executes in 1-3 seconds and Slaves are also Ok), I can increase DELETE LIMIT to 10000, If it is also Ok , I can increase some more. Table Structure of huge table 

From MySQL Documentation on Stored Routine Syntax When the routine is invoked, an implicit USE db_name is performed (and undone when the routine terminates). USE statements within stored routines are not permitted If you need to query tables from other databases you can do it like DBName.TableName. and you can change DBName dynamically. 

This consider all database names are different on all server. As you said all servers are , You can take on each server and restore it on new server Step 1 : Take dump from all old server like below Everything written in one file: table structures, indexes, triggers, stored procedures, users, encrypted passwords. 

I have 170GB of index and Data. I have to readjust the innodb_buffer_pool size for better performance.The Max table size of a InnoDB table(Index+data) is 28GB. So what should be the optimal size of innodb_buffer_pool. UPDATE we are going to migrate our this local database to ec2 so will set the RAM according to the current statistics of innodb that's why i need the size of buffer pool so we can have available RAM there. File Per table is enabled. I am using Linux machine. 

For more information about mysqldump please visit The Link. If you asking any other thing please clearly update with your question. 

I converted this into corresponding SELECT and executed. It took around to execute and I observed that It was in state for a long. I converted the same sub query to it executed in fraction of second. So I think I can optimize the query. After some analysis I found that the query was written inside a , So my question is If a query is written in is slow, it will not be logged into slow log file. Do we need to optimize each individually ? I have around 300+ SP's , 40+ Triggers as well as some events so I need to optimize them independently. UPDATE ON 31 Dec,2013 

And then find the following line and comment it out in your my.cnf file, which usually lives on or f on Unix/OSX systems. Comment bind-address Change line 

If a procedure is taking more time than slow log time it should be logged into slow log as , But this is not happening there is no call statement in slow log why ? Why the query is spending a huge amount of time in preparing state ? From General Thread States I found the definition of stated as 

For this you need to grant select permission to user (MySQL User) on that particular column of table. 

This will give you the desired result. Also Write one line in your code before you open the cursor otherwise each procedure call will be appending data in that table. 

Step 2 : Copy dump from all old servers to new server Step 3 : Extract all zips on new server Step 4 : Import extracted dump files on new server like below 

EDIT Someone has opened the City.frm file and modified it's content.So How will I recover it.? I am using . UPDATE: Adding my.cnf as asked by some peoples. Innodb Specific variables in My.Cnf 

Where is in table. When I execute the query independently it is being finished in but i have observed many times that query is hanging is processlist with state statistics. What may be the issue, I have found count of this query in slow log more than 10K times. 

If your MySQL Server and Workbench are on different machine then you need a mysql user to connect and you also need to comment the bind address in my.cnf User creation 

LIMIT will return after th records but it looks like you didn't have which satisfy your where clause condition. You can find no. of records which satisfy your where clause using this query 

Take these some points in your consideration they may help you in case of generating the dump and restoring it. 

I have a Production server On November 5,2011 the ibdata size was 100G. In Approximate 3 months it is increased to 200G.So it has just doubled its size.So it is a Huge Data.Currently lvm is 251G. I Have approximately all tables with Innodb.I am not using innodb per table. I have my idbata on lvm.So How much i should increase it for future use..? Or any other Best way to Handle the Scenario. 

Above Query will list all the tables having Engine. For how to convert your existing MyISAM tables to InnoDB Below is the Query that will Return ALTER Statements to convert existing Tables to . 

using with will generate the dump without the data. if you want only data dump do as(It will not contain the create statements) 

So in my opinion the MainDB.res is not the database. UPDATE In MySQL you can't create the Database's that contains the word "." 

As you have in your tables so you can't go with partitioning directly.As Partitioning does not support foreign keys in MySQL. You may go with partitioning but then you will have to create the work around for that.you have to ensure your integrity by using triggers for (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) on tables. i.e Insert into the Child table will only be allowed if the corresponding record exist in Parent table. You have to maintain all these integrity(INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) by using triggers. Then you can create the partitioning on table's on a quarter basis and then drop the partition. for creating the .sql files you may use clause with it will create the backup in . file format. You can also create the csv's for your old data for the future reference.
