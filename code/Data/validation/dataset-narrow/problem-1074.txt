Based on what you did, it sounds like the motherboard is probably shot. If you can get another power supply, you can try that, but I would not have much hope. As you alluded to, a new one, even refurbished, is probably a better way to go, but you have to look at the specifics as to cost for a replacement board, versus the possibly better specs of the newer computer. 

You would log in as the new local user, thereby creating a new profile. Then you want to reboot and log in as administrator. You reboot to release all files from memory, so they will not be in use when copied. Then you go to My computer>Properties>Advanced>User Profiles, and highlight the old domain user profile (usually the largest one), and click "Copy to". "Browse" to the C:\Documents and Settings\local user profile and click "Change" under "Permitted to use" and select the local user. Click OK. 

Open Computer, click to expose the menu bar. Then right click the open space next to "Help", and uncheck "Lock the toolbars". Now, you can resize the search box by grabbing the bar just to the left of it, but to the right of the circular arrows. 

Windows may boot with the new board out of the box, but it is possible that you will have to massage it go get it to work. If it does work, you should still update all your drivers from the motherboard's web site. If it doesn't the easiest way to do it is re-install and pick "upgrade": This will keep all your programs intact, but replace the hardware drivers and any other faulty registry settings. Even after the upgrade, update your drivers. If you try to upgrade to your same OS, but are not given the option (grayed out), it is likely because your original disk is older than your current service pack level. In that case, you will need to slip-stream your original OS disk to add your service pack level or newer. You can search how to slip-stream here as it comes up often. 

A standard user is a little more secure because they can't perform administrative tasks at all. With UAC, you run very close to that same mode, but it is more convenient to run those administrative tasks as necessary. There may also be things, like modifying some Windows settings, that are not convered by UAC unless you increase it to the maximum level. You are probably well off with UAC and the default setting, imo. 

There are a number of such programs: $URL$ $URL$ Google "virtual floppy usb" (minus the quotes) for more results. 

I would think as you did, and I just did test this on Outlook 2010, and it behaved as we expected. Despite the save warning, which I dismissed, it did save my delivery time. I would try another test e-mail, and see if it was just an anomaly with that one e-mail. If not, then you can start troubleshooting in earnest. 

For a 3.5" hard drive, it requires +12V DC to run the motor, AND +5V DC to run the circuit boards. With SATA a third +3.3V DC is also used in addition to the other two. For a typical 2.5" hard drive, it requires +5V DC (often converted to +3.3V DC by an on-board voltage regulator). 

It appears to be a legitimate site (I Googled spywarehelpcenter.com scam with nothing significant returned), but they would not be my first choice at all. I would run the following softwares to clean my computer: Malwarebytes, Superantispyware and Hitman Pro...all available virus-free at download.com. A great resource for removal info is $URL$ Their combofix is a very powerful tool that should be used as a last resource. $URL$ 

Do CACLS /? at a command prompt for the switch usage details, or Google "CACLS examples" (without the quotes). 

My guess is that you have file corruption. I would first do a at least a couple of times (most people don't realize that you often need to run this more than once), and if I still had problems, then I would do a System Restore too. Here is how to check your chkdsk results: $URL$ They never stop reporting finding some things, but when it gets down to finding only around 5 items, is when I stop running it. 

I Googled "colemak keyboard windows", and the first item returned was "Windows - Colemak - Colemak keyboard layout", but as A Dwarf noted it was down, so I clicked on the cached copy, and then the download button, and that works. You should be able to install it that way. $URL$ Click "Download now" 

Let me put it this way: I have been backing things up for about 23 years now, and never once have I had to worry about file corruption, nor have I ever had any that I knew of. Modern backup software can do a verify as part of the backup job, and to me, that seems sufficient. I always recommend multiple copies of a backup in case the entire backup is faulty, and that you test them periodically to make sure you can restore. Balance this advice against just how valuable the data is, but what you want to do seems like overkill, and a lot of extra work to me. 

Highlight an existing e-mail you want the rule to be based on (one with the subject you want the rule about), then click "Rules" on the "Home" tab. Click , and you should see the option to check subject with your existing subject already added (the second one down in the screenshot). 

The default IS find. Also, it is something that I cannot delete either as an admistrator. Here is what that box looks like on a known-good system: 

First, being in the temp folder, it can be deleted. Second, a quick Google search says that it is malware, which would jive with a Windows-sounding file being in the temp folder. $URL$ Supplemental: While you can still delete it, I found other another reference that is not malware: $URL$ Only if you are curious, you could right click it and go to the details tab, and see if says that some company you recognize made it. If so, they probably did, and it was left over from an install. If it empty, probably a bad file. 

My thoughts are that your boot.ini for XP is not pointing to the right partition, not necessarily that the hal.dll is wrong. You will get that error in that case. $URL$ $URL$ 

OK, based on your response, that means that it has to do with your Printer and its settings, not the applications. One common place I would look is the separator page: 

Easiest is to try converting it on an XP computer if you have access to one. Even when running things as an administrator, I have seen UAC get in the way of a few things, so I would turn of UAC, and then try again. To avoid this, is why I mentioned step 1. If it is not already a primary partition, I would try to make it one first. 

While there is some natural power conditioning when you go from AC to DC, a laptop's power supply does not really replace a UPS or power strip. That is not its function, nor is that built into it. While you are going to get roughly the same DC whether plugged directly into the wall or a UPS/power strip, there is nothing in front to guarantee that the adapter will not be damaged, and allow damage to your computer if you are not plugged into the UPS/power strip. There is a reason they sell laptop surge protectors. 

I may amend or delete this based on your answer to the above comment/question. This is what I believe is going on, and it may help you some. The first part is easy: You are trying to use DNS to ping workstations that are not registered in DNS anywhere, and your router/DNS server is returning its external IP address (I believe, and your answer to the question above will confirm this). The second part is that if you compare two Windows workstations, when they don't register to a local DNS server, they use NetBIOS over TCP/IP to find each other. In your case, I am not sure if you have anything similar you can use as I am not a Linux or Mac guy, and if yo do, it is not currently in use. What I can say is that you could set up your Linux box to act as a DNS server, host your own DNS, and register your computers with that server; or you can simply continue to use HOSTS files. Lastly, someone very likely may come along and add another answer that tells you how to let Linux and Macs communicate without using DNS, similar to NetBIOS over TCP/IP. If someone does not come along with something similar to the NetBIOS over TCP/IP concept, then my personal opinion is that you are fine with using HOSTS files, and that is the way to go.
