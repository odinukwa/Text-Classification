Save that script to a file and run it (after you install ciscoconfparse). That script will print interfaces without port-security. This is the github link to the library: ciscoconfparse Full disclosure: I am the author of the library 

ISE is basically just a fancy RADIUS server, which is heavily focused on EAP / 802.1X. Save yourself pain and suffering, don't hammer the square peg (ISE) into a round hole (CLI accounting). Cisco ACS is designed for CLI accounting; ISE isn't. 

By most common usage, MPLS is a VPN, but it's an unencrypted VPN. I assume you mean an encrypted VPN, such as PPTP, IPSec, or SSL VPN when you mention "VPN". However, if you need strong encryption, data integrity, or Authentication inside the VPN, rfc4381 MPLS VPN Security, Section 5.2 recommends encrypting inside MPLS VPN. However, encrypted VPNs are not without problems themselves; they generally suffer from: 

You can safely delete and add aliases because the ASA reverts to the IP address when the name disappears... The original alias is ... 

Packet flow: If R1 receives a packet for 203.0.113.50, it will forward the packet to R2. R2 has a connected interface for 203.0.113.0/24, so it looks up the layer2 adjacency information for 203.0.113.501 and forwards R1's packet to . As long as 203.0.113.50 has a default pointing to R2, and R2 can reach the IP subnet which originally sourced the traffic behind R1, then there are no problems. In summary, NAT is a local operation between two interfaces on the same router / firewall. NAT does not affect the reach-ability of interfaces that are not participating in NAT. 

This is a judgement call, and I don't have enough information to say. If you'd like to join me in NE chat, I could walk you through some questions to isolate this further. The biggest question I have is whether you would need 100Mbps any time other than your PC backup case. Leveraging the reality that your average packet size is high for backup traffic, one could potentially buy an even smaller router than the Cisco 2951 if you police the traffic to the systems other than the one that needs 100Mbps for backup traffic. That said, now we are talking about a more complicated configuration; perhaps you have the money to burn on a Cisco 3925 and don't want to deal with configuration complexities. Finally think about site growth... if this site grows rapidly, or people are prone to changing their minds about requirements on a whim, just buy the Cisco 3925 and be done with it :-). 

Your plan looks pretty good... the only suggestion for minimal downtime would to add a ping of the new HSRP address... 

Yes... very similar to the link in the comment... As you mentioned, you only need to do two things... 

I have been thinking about this question for the last six hours... I think the most appropriate answer is "Nobody wins". In other words, at least two computers can't be used reliably. Furthermore, you are spending time fixing a problem, and that time could have been used on something much more productive. Anyone who has been a network engineer for long knows that time is one thing we often run short on. A basic solution to prevent IP conflicts IP conflicts indicate a basic breakdown in, or lack of good IP allocation processes. If the process is at fault, these kind of issues should be addressed quickly; otherwise you could spend too many cycles on tactical problems like this. Proactive planning could be using: 

You should turn loop guard on those ports... if rstp blocks a port and looses bpdus, it will unblock and form an unmanaged loop unless stp loopguard is on the port. If an rstp port looses bpdus on a loopguard port, the port will disable in a loop inconsistent state until it starts receiving bpdus again. 

In short, only one DBD sequence number can be unacknowledged at any given time. The Master is in charge of ensuring that DBD sequence numbers are correctly acknowledged. Two cooks in the kitchen doesn't work... one must have control over sequence numbers (the master) and one must acknowledge (the slave). 

Why would you ever send line-rate 64 byte packets in any scenario other than a switch drag-race? That said, cisco's data sheet numbers indicate it can do unidirectional 64-byte line rate for at least seven computers. I'm assuming you understand that ethernet's IFG and SFD mean that you get nowhere near 1Gbps of real data @ 64 bytes. If you're using FTP, HTTP, CIFS/SMB, H.264 or any other protocol used for data transfer, then yes 7 computers can do bi-directional line-rate based on Cisco's quoted 14.88Mpps and 20Gbps of "bandwidth" in the data sheet 

If you poll ipNetToMediaPhysAddress on a router attached to the Brocade / DLink Layer2 switches, you will see the same dot1qTpFdbPort mac-addresses from the Layer2 switches in that router's ARP table (assuming you did a recent ping sweep of the relevant subnets through the router in question). Also note that if VRRP / HSRP / GLBP are used on the subnet, you should poll ipNetToMediaPhysAddress both FHRP peers, due to potential asymmetric routing. ARP / Mac Polling Technique I have to do a lot of polling like this where I map mac addresses / ports found in dot1qTpFdbPort to IP addresses from ipNetToMediaPhysAddress. I always ping sweep (with a tool like ... ) through the subnet just before I poll the router / downstream switches with snmp. 

One thing I can't speak for are features / IOS questions... however, those are outside the scope of your question. 

Configure a packet capture buffer on the ASA. For tcp traffic, the syntax is Wait for the denied traffic to understand why the traffic was denied. Remove the capture with 

Your gut instinct is correct. Speaking as a guy who has built networks for the last 20 years, you should never blindly accept significant ongoing packet loss on a wired network, and do not let any equipment vendor or ISP tell you otherwise. Regular 10 to 30 second outages are unacceptable; if you have a choice, perhaps you could let your upstream know that you're going to start considering your options unless they take the problem seriously. The sad reality is that bandwidth isn't free, ISPs profit margins are usually quite low, and some providers will do everything they can to save money even if it means unhappy customers (crazy as that may sound). Assuming I'm sending basic TCP traffic, the most packet loss I will accept for a public internet service (where you expect some loss from occasional over-subscription) is 0.10% over a 24 hour period, and no more than 0.50% over any 5 minute period Note 1. I tolerate 0.0% packet loss inside our wired corporate network Note 2. As long as the packet drops are not expected, corporate network engineers should upgrade their circuits (or LAN) if they start seeing packet loss. 

Can anyone explain what I need to do to get DNS queries correctly translated? I need a query for b2masd1 in the DMZ to a nameserver on the INSIDE interface to return 1.195.18.182 (because the ASA translates the INSIDE A-Record 10.195.18.182 to DMZ addr 1.195.18.182). I have set up a chat room to assist with diagnosis 

End Notes Note 1 A loop is just a physical or logical jumper, which connects the Transmit side to the Receive side of the same circuit. This is usually done so a tech can validate the circuit is functional to some demarc point in their network. Ironically, it takes down all connectivity past the loop (until it is removed).
