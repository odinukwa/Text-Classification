I have picked up adware in that shows extra irrelevant google ads. This only happens in Internet Explorer 10, not Firefox or Iron. I have tried some removals for similar viruses with no luck. I have scanned with MalwareBytes, Windows Defender(I am using Windows 8 RTM, so this is the same as MSE), Spybot, Ad Aware, McAfee, Norton, and AVG, with no luck. Here's a screenshot: 

Whenever I open Internet Explorer I get this error : "The webpage is unavailable because you are offline". I have to disable Work Offline mode every time. It only started doing this after I added a dial up connection. But the dial up connection only works when my phone is plugged in, most of the time I use a wifi connection. Why does IE go offline when the dial up connection is offline, even if my wireless connection is online? 

In Windows 8, How do you set the default program for the mailto protocol to a custom exe? Under Default Programs, the only option I get is to select from a list of programs (Mail or Google Chrome) or to "Look for an app in the store". However, I want to associate the mailto protocol with a custom exe. 

I want to disable the driver for my touchpad. It is called "PS/2 Compatible Mouse". If I go to properties the disable button is grayed out. There is also no option to disable in the context menu if I right click on it in device manager. A attached a screenshot of the issue below. I am using Windows 8 but I'm guessing the issue would be the same in Windows 7. 

As you can see, ads are added to the tan area as well as several extra white results, which are especially irrelevant. I like IE10 and would like to keep using it, but these ads are annoying. I'm also worried there may be spyware as well. 

Try one of these links, $URL$ and then use the ISO Edition Switcher to change the version you downloaded to starter so your key will work. If that does not work then you will most likely need to buy a new edition. I would recommend Newegg for the best price, unless your find a deal elsewhere. 

Your best bet would be if your motherboard supported raid 1 and you did it with an external drive. But if you are going to do that you might as well just the same harddrive as your current one and run a real raid 1. I'm not even sure if raid between a sata and esata ports works. If you are talking about having a new installation of windows 7 ready to go, not a duplicate of your current one, then I would say buy another harddrive, install windows to that drive as well, and use it like a dual boot system, but only boot to the secondary drive if the primary one fails. 

Windows tells every monitor connected to wake up when you start using it, either buy moving the mouse or connecting remotely. Why don't you just turn off the monitors that you don't want to be woken up. If they are still plugged in, windows will still generate the images for them, so if you have an extended desktop, you can still drag programs onto screens you cannot actually see. You could also try and create a batch file that, when run, changes your screen resolution settings to display only the primary monitor. This would mean you remotely connect in, the monitors turn on, you run the script, the secondary monitors get set to unused and they go back to standby. How you would write this script I do not know. 

Open the document on your screen, zoom in on the picture to make it as large as possible but all of it is still visible. Press alt+prnt scrn (or the equivalent on your operating system) and it should take a screen shot of the program. Now open up paint or your favorite image editor (photoshop, gimp, etc) paste in the picture and crop out anything you don't want. 

I'm trying to use Windows Backup on Windows 7 to create a system image to a network location. The destination, identified by UNC path, is an Apple Time Capsule formatted with HFS+. While Windows allows this location for regular backups, it claims that system images can only be written to NTFS-formatted locations. 

After an accidental submersion in some water, my Thinkpad X201 is still functioning just fine, except that the center (blue) trackpoint button appears to 'click' roughly once a second. This is actually a pretty serious annoyance in many situations. I've never used the button, so I'm perfectly fine just disabling it altogether. Unfortunately the TrackPoint driver pane (along with other Mouse settings in the control panel) only allows me to toggle between scroll, zoom, and click functionality, all of which are undesirable when activated constantly. Note that this X201 configuration has only the trackpoint, without the trackpad and additional set of buttons (UltraNav) found in other configurations or newer Thinkpads. Is there any way to disable the middle button entirely? 

I currently share my DSL connection using a wireless router with DHCP disabled, and dnsmasq running on a Mac Mini serving DHCP & DNS. This setup is important because I have clients doing PXE boot, and I need the control over DHCP that dnsmasq provides. There is also a Time Capsule on the network that's used purely as a backup device; its wireless functions are disabled. The wireless router is starting to get a little flaky, and since it doesn't support 802.11n I'd like to replace it. Rather than buying a new router, I'd like to just use the Time Capsule. But I see no way to disable its DHCP server; when I set the connection type to PPPoE, it insists on serving DHCP. Is there any way to use Airport PPPoE with a DHCP server elsewhere on the network? 

I've been using Thunderbird for a few years, and have accumulated ~2GB of mail locally. My mail service is being migrated to an externally hosted Exchange server with ample storage. I'd like to migrate all my old messages to that server, where they will remain. Is there a way to do this? I care mainly about migrating the messages, and their folder structure if at all possible. I'm not concerned with contacts or any secondary stuff from Thunderbird.
