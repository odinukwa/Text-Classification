I am working on a laptop at work, and log in using my domain account. I will be leaving the laptop in the office for other people to use. I could just format the partition along with my data, but I would rather just delete the user profile. Basically I want to ensure that anything stored under this user profile is removed. 

This question is for musicians / guitarists. I'm looking for some software that can play chords in a loop, while I play the lead. I could record the rhythm manually, and overlay it, but I'm having latency issues with my input device. So some synthesized rhythm would work. Looking for something that sounds like an acoustic guitar. It should be able to play all major / minor chords as well as sus, 2,5,7ths - you name it. I want to setup a song pattern, and then reply it, while I play lead. Thanks in advance. 

Don't rule out the possibility it could be hardware related. I had the same problem with my ISP provided router. Till I went out and bought my own... now problem is fixed... 

I am running Windows 7 XP Mode and want to access local C:\ drive on host, this can be done, but browsing the folder structure is not quick, and there are long wait periods. Now I know this isn't a network latency issue - because the guest is running directly on the host, what else can I do to speed up \tsClient connections? 

I have an external WD MyBook. it has USB, Firewire and e-sata connectors, but I would like to mount it internally in my desktop system instead for extra performance, and I'm also considered about how long it will last externally. Does anyone know if this is possible? Has anyone done this with success? I would have to remove it from the existing external chasis, but before I mess around with this, I would like to know if its even possible. Thanks in advance 

I've found a great deal of articles and information that explains the benefits of the new controller and how this delivers performance. I haven't found anything to suggest that the memory being used is somehow better and more durable. Is it the same memory as in the previous Intel X25-m series? 

I found one solution, Paint.net might not be the app I want to go for, instead I downloaded Artweaver, and besides being a better overall product in my opinion to Paint.net, it also is more geared towards modern productivity tasks - like save for web. 

I would like to reskin Windows 7. I have bought Window Blinds, but I am looking for clean and simplistic Skins, Window Blind Skins are extremely pimped out. Are there any alternative to Window Blinds? I guess I really want my Windows 7 install to look as close as possible to Linux Mint. That would be awesome if this was possible. Thanks 

I have a VPN connection I would like to "save". In Windows 7. Is this possible, so that when I do a reinstall, I can easily just recreate this vpn connection? 

I recently reinstalled my PC only to find this very strange problem persists. The only way for me to describe this is to show you: 

Is it possible to have 1 network share which includes both folders (as read only!) \machine_name\all_movies for example? I'm setting up sharing for my media tank, so this would eliminate a lot of hassle. 

Its strange, but a lot of the time I find myself clicking the back button a few times before it seems to work. Is this just me with this issue, or has anyone else experienced this with Chrome? 

I am on a work contract for 1 week, during this time I've been assigned an old laptop which I installed Windows 7 on. When the week is done I want to wipe the system, something like FDisk, really anything to ensure my personal data (any) is not left behind. Is it possible to hit the kill switch in Windows, so that you can wipe the whole drive quick. I won't have time to do a reinstall. I just want the partition gone. There is only 1 active partition, the boot C:\ drive. 

I am about to reinstall my Windows based PC (Win 7). Everytime I do this I pray and hope I didn't forget to back something up and forget something or other. I was wondering if there is a checklist online that has a list of stuff you should backup prior to doing a reinstall? Last time I forget browser shortcuts and favorites. Just due to the sheer amount of stuff stored, its easy to forget stuff like VPN connections or locally stored images, documents etc. So working from a checklist might give me ideas for stuff I might have otherwise forgotten. Does such a checklist exist? 

I would love to cross over. I'm a c# developer and its my bread and butter stuff. So a few things holding me back are VS2010, Sharepoint, SQL and the infamous IIS. Just to be clear .net is not the problem! Mono is (at times) an even better implementation of the .net framework than true .net. Don't believe me - check out mailing - Mono long ago discovered to send a QUIT command to the server. .net only does this in v4. I think the way forward is to setup an additional windows server, develop on that using RDC. Virtualization will only get you so far, and if you're like me (no patience) you'll want stuff to run as quick as possible natively. RDCing into a quick server might be a good compromise for now. Your client pc then can be completely linux based, or some apps running under wine. Failing that, plan a longer term migration away from MS tech. You could still use Mono, just don't use any MS tech. This sounds like a huge challenge and it is. But the best thing about this is you'll never get involved in Sharepoint solutions. Disclaimer, I'm not a fanboy, but I think Linux has some great potential for more specialized computer users. 

I am re-installing a computer for a friend (Windows XP SP3), do you get a program that can automatically detect hardware for the system? For example motherboard, graphics card, network card. This would save me time trying to hunt down drivers. Thank you 

I'll say if you want an SSD I haven't heard much bad about Intel. On the other hand, I've seen OCZ have after market soldiering on the RevoDrive. Besides this I've owned an OCZ drive and it broke. After much research I found the quality of OCZ SSD's to be extremely questionable. Also remember you get the Intel 510, which replaces previous models. And the RevoDrive doesn't support trim, because it comes in RAID 0 configuration OOB. EDIT: pick up a new mobo, and a PCI raid controller, and buy 2x Intel 510's and you'll be smiling. 

I have an existing project file (created in project 2007 professional), opened by me in project professional 2010, and saved. I open this newly saved file, and connect to Project Server (2010) using my credentials (I'm admin), now when I try and publish this existing project, I can't because the button is grayed out. If I start from a blank file, I can publish without any issues (so its not permissions). I suspect something is wrong with the template for this project, but I have no idea what, any idea what to check for? 

Avira free - $URL$ Before Avira I used to use AVG free, but Avira has better detection rates. If you're in the market for a paid product (which you don't need), you could try Vipre or Esset Nod32. 

I have this annoying problem that I just can't seem to fix. Recently I upgraded my main boot drive to an OCZ Vertex Turbo (60GB) which is an SSD. I've installed Windows 7 64bit. The drive works, and is really quick... blah blah blah. My problem is when I do a restart, for example click start, then arrow next to shutdown, and restart. The computer will shut down, and do a warm reboot, but it gets stuck where it says loading Windows. Just before the animation starts. So what I have to do is physically press the reset switch on the computer, then it restarts, firing up a menu which offers to launch Windows Startup Repair, so I select "Start Windows Normally". After this I boot in normally, but its damn annoying. Any ideas why this is happening, what I can do to fix it? 

I'm talking about my recent experience on Windows, but I think my experience over the last 2 weeks can help you. Basically my SSD drive was failing. It took me about a week to detect the problem. The Windows Event viewer didn't exactly show any useful errors pinpointing I/O failure, but mainly this service crashed, this permission failed to be applied, this type of thing. In the meantime regular blue screens of death, crashes reboots and freezing up. Imo - Sure your problem can very easily be HDD related. EDIT: As mentioned this was with an SSD drive. 

I have a line that is pointing downwards. I have added some text description to this line and I would like it to be horizontally aligned, but I can't find a way to change the orientation. By default the text faces the same direction as the line (arrow). How can I get the text to be horizontally aligned? Thanks 

I've recently found the cause of my mouse lag (Logitech Desktop Wave), which usually works perfectly without any lag at all, except for when there is activity on my wireless network. Clearly it is the wireless router interfering with the mouse. I logged into the router admin, and found it has the ability to switch the channel. There are actually 13 options. I decided to try change, but if anything it made the lag worse. Do I really have to try out all the channels by trial and error, or has anyone found a particular channel that works well with Desktop Wave? Thanks 

NO, its not possible. I've added this answer, but I think that with the current tech, it might not be possible. I'll remove this answer, if anyone figures out how to do it. 

I have the task of preparing an HTML file that will be used in a Kindle ebook. I would like to preview this HTML file in Kindle to see how it translates fonts and images. Is this possible using Amazon Kindle for PC? Or are there other emulators out there? The Kindle emulator Amazon provide in Amazon DTP actually looks terrible. I hope Kindles don't really interpret HTML like the Amazon provided emulator. 

This sort of thing. Is deleting the user profile enough, or should I manually uninstall the apps too? And (I don't know) run some 3rd party software? 

I've noticed there are lots of plugins for Paint.net, but I can't seem to find one that essentially saves for web, almost like Photoshop does this. Let me explain: Lets say you have a large image. Photoshop has the ability to resize this image and adjust the resolution / dpi all in 1 easy step. this way you end up with excellent file sizes after the resize without doing this resizing manually. Please post if you know of such a plugin, thanks 

I have 2 drives both with differant folders. Is it possible for me to create a folder for example d:\passthrough and have it act like a merge between a folder on drive 1 and another folder on drive 2. Read only would be fine, I guess because it would be hard to tell the folder how to act to write operations. Another scenario would be: 1 folder called g:\myFolder when viewed should list the contents of itself AS WELL AS the contents of another folder. Any copy operations would be delegated to the drive that has the most freespace. Is any of this possible with Windows 7? 

With privacy you always have to question motivation. What possible motivation would Google have for monitoring typing speeds? Profit? Unlikely. And I don't see any non profit public campaigns to improve peoples overall typing speed. Neither do I see any newspaper or online news articles stating "World typing speed in crisis". Sure its possible for Google to deduct this info, but how accurate would it really be? Even if keystrokes were being statistically measured, they're sent as packets, and because of this due to unpredictable network latency. I applaud your creative thinking, people like you help technology progress... 

I have been searching the web, and can't seem to find a downloadable package of OpenSSL v1.0.0 for Windows. Does anyone know where I can find this? 

I recently read an article saying you can overclock an i5 750 to perform almost as well as a core i7 975 extreme (factory settings). But obviously this requires some serious cooling. Is installing a water cooling solution expensive and complicated? I would like to start trying out new stuff, but I have very little knowledge on overclocking and cooling. 

I found this answer: More of a workaround, but its enough: Go into an elevated command prompt (cmd.exe run as administrator) and type in: winsat formal 

That CD drive could be faulty. Try another drive; you did mention it was an old computer. Failing that, clean the CD. 

My Logitech C270 appears to be capable of motion detection, but the only thing the software can do is record when motion is picked up. If possible I would like my computer in sleep mode to wake up as I sit down at my desk, if the camera detects motion. While I know this is completely unnecessary, you have to admit its a pretty cool little project. Is this type of thing possible? Running Windows 7 

Figured it out. Sometimes when Chrome is loading a page, and only somtimes ALL buttons are unresponsive just for a sec, its during this time the back button won't work. The only workaround I can think of is to get into the habit of waiting for ALL page content to load before you click the back button. 

I have a router, that has built in hardware firewall capabilities, do I need to install an additional software firewall on my Windows 7 PC like ZoneAlarm? 

I have uploaded a folder to my ftp site. Problem is GoDaddy hosting do not allow directory browsing over http. I would like to give share this folder with 1 person who is not technically inclined. Is there a program that can scan an ftp folder and generate htttp links for each file - recursive for each sub dir? I guess I should have zipped the folder before uploading, but since its already uploaded, anything I can do to save face? Creating a limited ftp account is also not really possible with Who'sYourDaddy - I mean GoDaddy!
