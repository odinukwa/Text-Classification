I did a bit of research on this and I would tend to agree with FRob and Tiago that this is related to Group Policy and latent Registry entries, but since you are either a power user or local admin(inferred since IT had you run a .reg file).. I would suggest a simpler option. Open computer management (hit the and type in "compmgmt.msc") then device manager and delete your CD/DVD drive. Then reboot. It will be re-installed and it will likely recreate any necessary registry key w/o you having to mess around in the registry or group policy. Deleting your DVD drive may sound drastic, but its really not a big deal. I assume you plugged the USB drive in and it installed drivers itself. It will do it again. Good Luck, Spencer 

If the info is correct then the Mask for the subnet 255.255.0.0, then its simply 94.239.255.255. Search for an ip calc and enter the ip and subnet mask to confirm if you want. 

Not a fix for your issue, but if "99% of people use non-windows systems" then VMWare Player (or VirtualBox) and Ubuntu should work. $URL$ $URL$ 

The answer by WinOutreach4 is very thorough for physical PCs/Servers, but when dealing with VMWare and Templates, I agree with those who have told you not to Sysprep. Convert the Template to a VM, Update it then Convert it to back to a Template. Nothing Else. When you deploy from the Template, customize the image and check the box to generate new SIDs, this is all you need. The way I understand Sysprep is to generalize and/or repackage a windows install so you can remove unused drivers. It is absolutely a must when doing a P2V (Physical to Virtual) or creating an image which you will install on multiple types of PC hardware. If you want to create an unattend.xml Sysprep an image once, that is a good way to automates much of the basic setup and I strongly encourage you to look into the WAIK Windows Automated Install Kit for help making your XML file. -Spencer 

PsLoggedOn is a tool included in the PSTools suite. It pretty easy to tell what it does. the usage is: psloggedon \computername It does require admin rights, but I love sharing the ps tools suite any time I can. $URL$ *Edit-Added Link -Spencer 

Go to control panel and disable your firewall. Try it from an external IP and if it works, you can add an exception for the port you set it it. 

Sounds like Apache may be configured to only accept connections from the local host. Have you tried accessing the website from the hosting server via the public address? Also, for testings sake, I would probably put the 0.0.0.0/0 rule back into place until you figure out the issue. Simplicity! 

I have used Recuva in the past, it will search the disk and allow you to recover any files it finds depending on search options. I don't think it will recover the partition so there may be better options, but I have had success with this in the past. $URL$ 

It looks like the Creator's update pushed out and/or reset new stuff from Microsoft. I have uninstalled and disabled UWPs as much as I can, along with Cortana and Edge. Yet today I saw a weird green bar popup saying something about "Press Win + G to bring up the game bar". I figured it would have to do with the Xbox UWP app, which I have previously uninstalled. I presume this is UWP functionality, but I'm not sure how to find out for certain. Can this app or program exist outside of the UWP ecosystem? Is it a part of the Xbox app? What method(s) are there to remove it? Is there a prophylactic to prevent such things in the future? I'm currently stuck in Windows Home, even though I tried to upgrade to Pro (not me, but gives you context). I will be fixing that sometime soon. 

I let Firefox auto update and I don't like some new feature, the new GUI, or it broke something. How do I roll back or downgrade? NOTE: Potential duplicate questions (1, 2) did not come up in a search of SuperUser, but they did as suggested questions when I typed the title. Weird. Those other questions do not give instructions on how to downgrade Firefox, simply pointing to where you can find older versions. Such referring-only questions are no longer welcome on SuperUser. 

Lately I've noticed that I can't compose a new email, nor reply to an email using the GMail web interface. I run GMail in a private browsing tab/window in Firefox 56.02 on Windows 7 64. I also tried Firefox ESR 52.6 on windows 10 64 Enterprise with a similar set of security extensions and got the same result. No decentralyes though, as its not compatible. For a long time I didn't send much email, but lately I've started using email again and this is becoming bothersome. I found that if I use the HTML view, I can compose and reply. However, the modern view gives me the problem. There is no longer a way to force GMail to use HTML view all the time, though as recently as a few years ago, if you used it more than a few times, you would be given the option to permanently switch. On a side note, GMail consumes about 100 - 120mb of RAM per tab, while HTML view uses 5 - 15mb per tab. I found a variety of people complaining about this issue over the years, but no solutions or things to try to fix. 2008, 2010, and 2014 come to mind, though it was the other day when I searched for a solution. Regardless, any fixes from more than a year or two ago won't even apply, and I did not find anything recent. I do use a variety of security minded extensions to keep Google's (and others) tentacle's at bay. Noscript is allowing all scripts on the page, though I am using Decentralyes to replace some javascript so that I don't leak IP address information. What it does in a nutshell: 

Is there a command that can be given to GnuPG: to add user ID without having to go through the Key Edit menu. We need to be able to add and delete User IDs from inside a Python program. It would be wonderful if there was a way to do that with one single line. Does anyone know how to do that? Thank you in advance. Vivarto 

I have been using PGP and then GnuPG for over 20 years now, and my oldest key is still on MIT server since 1996. (RSA 1024 without subkeys...) Over the time the keys became pairs of Main and Subkey. In all these years I have not once needed the subkey function. Nor do I know anyone personally who has used it. I might have read all the "Good Reasons" for why subkeys "should" be used. But none to these reasons applied to me. E.g. subkeys are great when the encryption key is compromised!!! But my encryption keys have never been compromised. Neither do I know anyone who's keys has. Or supposedly it is good for organizations where one main key is associated with many encryption keys. I have not seen it. I wonder if such organization exists anywhere in this Universe. From all I have seen, the subkey idea appears to be a case of over-engineering with no or very rare use in real life. Perhaps the idea is just a rationalization of the DSA/elGamal scheme. In any case, I am working on some software where Subkeys are not utilized. Also, I want my keys to be compatible with RetroShare (a secure p2p IM chat and file exchange, using only single keys without subkeys.) Does anyone know if there a way to generate keys without subkeys. I am only aware of the option to remove subkeys in the --edit-key menu. I don't know if keys can be generated without them. Is there a way? thank you much for any help to further understand this issue. 

I would like to have five signature added to my public lock before uploading it to the server. Ho can A simmilar question: How can I combine 5 signatures on a Alices public key? I would like to have all five signatures on one key-file. 

GPG/PGP and other public key encryptions allow encrypting to several recipients using their public keys. Is it possible to use only symmetric encryption to do that same? In other words is it possible to symmetrically encrypt a file with two different keys? The reason for my question is that asymmetric encryption produces produces huge files. If I were to send a public key encrypted message to a smart phone it would be too huge. Especially if it was encrypted to several recipients. One single "Hello" could take 2 pages of text. On the other hand symmetric encryption is very tight. 

I use my signature to validate a public key. If someone's public the key is signed by me, then it is considered secure to encrypt and send emails to that recipient. Is there a command under gpg that allows me to ask if a particular public key is signed by me, or do I need to use --list-sigs keyID and then look for my signature in the output?
