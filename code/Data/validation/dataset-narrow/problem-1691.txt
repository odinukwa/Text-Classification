Issue 6 of TheMagPi mentions (on page 9) that you can connect power to TP1 and TP2 if you want to, but everywhere else I've read says that those points are for measuring rather than powering. Elsewhere I've seen mention of it being possible (but not necessarily recommended) to power from the +5V and Gnd pins of the regular GPIO connector (P1) as Milliways already mentioned. 

Yes, it's contact bounce. But note that the RISING edge you're listening for is the button release, not the button press. So I guess when you do a slow push you're getting a "fake" spike when you press and then the real rising edge when you release. One way to remove the false call is within your pinkCall method, wait a little bit (like 0.1 seconds) and then check the value of GPIO.input(pinkPin). If it's still high, then it was a "real" rising edge, and the button has really been released. If it's low, it was just a spike and can be ignored. Of course this has the disadvantage that you're not reacting immediately to the button release - if this is important then you can use a capacitor as Milliways suggested. 

From what I've read, it is possible to record audio using an external USB soundcard or a USB webcam. But everything I've seen so far is just concerned with recording sound and saving it. What I'd like to do is imitate a multi-track sequencer, does anyone know if this is already possible? What I mean is, you press a key and start recording your "B ts B tsts B ts", then press another key and it plays back this track in a loop. Then, while this track is playing, you press another key and record the "dom dom dom dom" over the top. Finish this one and it now plays both these tracks together in an infinite loop. Then maybe temporarily mute the first track while you sing the "la la la la" and then unmute the first track again. I don't want to carefully prepare and arrange and program these tracks to produce some finished output, I just want to play with it in real-time. So that means playing and recording simultaneously, playing multiple sound elements simultaneously, and not relying on some kind of offline slow processing. Now maybe this kind of thing is already available for the pi and I just have to install it, or maybe it's the kind of thing which could do relatively easily if I just have to put the pieces together. It would have to be low latency though, it wouldn't work if there were awkward pauses at the end of the loops. Or maybe the pi just isn't a suitable platform for this? 

Step 1 Take the 3V3 output from the Pi, into the LED, from the LED into the resistor, and from the resistor to the Gnd of the Pi. The LED should light up (no code required). I guess you have already done this step as your LED is on (although I can't quite figure out your wiring). Step 2 Take GPIO pin 11 output from the Pi, into the LED, from the LED into the resistor, and from the resistor to the Gnd of the Pi. Using RPi.GPIO in python, call GPIO.setmode to select BCM or BOARD, then configure this GPIO pin to be an output, and set the output LOW. The LED should be off. Set the output to HIGH, and the LED should light up. Step 3 Take GPIO pin 12 from the Pi, into a switch, and from the switch to the Gnd of the Pi. Using RPi.GPIO in python, configure this GPIO pin to be an input and select the internal pull-up resistor. Now look at the GPIO.input of this pin, it should be high. Press the button and look at GPIO.input again, it should be now low (because you've connected it to Gnd). Step 4 - up to you. The RPi.GPIO wiki page is an excellent starting point. 

Also it's good to get into the habit of using your own packages, rather than just using the default package. ==== Question now updated with even more examples... From the home directory , you should have the files , and , right? Please check this (including getting capitals and little letters correct on all the filenames). From what you said, works, right? So try and that should work too. This just specifies the current directory as the classpath. Now try and that must work too, because adding sigar.jar and to the classpath shouldn't stop things working. Now if that works, and doesn't work, then that would be really strange indeed, unless sigar.jar depends on other jars too? Also, what platform is your netbeans on? Can you run CpuInfo from the command line on that machine or not? I'd be really really surprised if this was a Raspberry Pi problem. 

Do you need to learn C/C++? No, there are countless things you can do with the Pi without ever touching any C or C++ code or using a compiler. Even lots of programming in other languages which are just as valid. For example, Scratch, python, perl, java, and so on. Do you need to learn linux/debian? No, you can run Risc or just use XBMC or other non-linux systems. Or non-Debian linux distros. Or you can use debian linux (like Raspbian) without learning the theory of how to compile your own kernel. Do you need to learn electronics? No, you can make lots of fun projects with the Pi without electronics. Use it as a mini file server, use it as a tv-top entertainment box, use it to learn about programming, and so on. You don't need to learn any specific topics. If you want to play with the GPIO pins and light up some leds, do that, and read up about transistors and stuff as you go. If you want to learn C++, do that, and read up what you need. If you want to know more about debian, do that, and read up when you get stuck. This question is just like all the "what is the best programming language" questions - start instead with what you want to do. What on earth is "learning raspberry pi" or "working with raspberry pi"? Then it should be easy to figure out what you need to know to do what you want. 

You need to narrow the problem down a bit. Is it that the pi can't access anything on the internet, or just the mirrors? Is it just the pi which is having these problems or do other computers on your network not see the internet either? Trying pinging from the pi and from your PC. If neither can see it, then maybe the mirrordirector is having problems at the moment. Try going to a web page on both machines, does that work? Could it be that your ISP is having problems with its nameserver? Could it be that your network cable has popped out of the router? If it's just the mirrordirector which is causing problems, then try using a different mirror, see if you can ping any of the ones listed at $URL$ .
