While reading up on front-door vrf concept here, i am just wondering , what if we made the network statements more precise/specific or used different subnets altogether, we would never have our tunnel go down due to Can you please confirm if this is a good approch to understanding concept? 

Not sure if this is is the right place to ask, but i will still go ahead.I have been reading up on Cisco's VMS solution and i see that the main stress is laid on the fact that things which were done using dedicated ASICs(burnt-in hardware into the box for dedicated application), can now be performed using software. Q1:How can a software ever do a piece of work that a hardware initially did?A software is nothing but a piece of code. I fail to understand how it works. Can you please give a real life example. Q2:Assuming the software can do the job of a hardware, how would it make that better? Is it because of --ease of update, ease of management and ease of shipping? Please clarify. 

Q1:As you see R1, learns the route 100.0.0.0 in the vrf TEST11. Even though i did not activate the neighbor under , but still R1 learns that route. How? Is the acting as the transport carrier for that route? Q2:In another scenario, i removed the neighbor from the vpnv4 address family on both R1 and R2 as seen below On R1 

That is official documentation from Cisco, so I don't doubt that. As far as L2 header is concerned it is added depending on the L2 technology(Ethernet, Frame Relay etc.) The document is not taking L2 header in consideration, but when you will calculate packet size for VoIP Packet, it will be taken into consideration. 

bridged adpter in VMWare works as an adapter directly connected to the network. That means it will get IP Address in the range of your NIC IP. If a virtual adapter is configured for NAT then it will get IP Address from internal DHCP of VMWare and the range will be different than the bridged network. You are saying that you have bridged eth0 and eth1. Bridged adapter and NAT adapter can't be bridged(Bridge, Switch are L2 terms). You will have to configure some routing table to connect them. Bridged Networking Bridged networking connects a virtual machine to a network by using the network adapter on the host system. If the host system is on a network, bridged networking is often the easiest way to give the virtual machine access to that network. When you install Workstation on a Windows or Linux host system, a bridged network (VMnet0) is set up for you. NAT Networking With NAT, a virtual machine does not have its own IP address on the external network. Instead, a separate private network is set up on the host system. In the default configuration, a virtual machine gets an address on this private network from the virtual DHCP server. The virtual machine and the host system share a single network identity that is not visible on the external network. When you install Workstation on a Windows or Linux host system, a NAT network (VMnet8) is set up for you. When you use the New Virtual Machine wizard to create a new virtual machine and select the typical configuration type, the wizard configures the virtual machine to use the default NAT network. You can have only one NAT network. Host-Only Networking Host-only networking creates a network that is completely contained within the host computer. Host-only networking provides a network connection between the virtual machine and the host system by using a virtual network adapter that is visible on the host operating system. When you install Workstation on a Windows or Linux host system, a host-only network (VMnet1) is set up for you. Please check VMWare documentation(chapter 5) $URL$ 

I was going through the use cases of GRE tunnel and see that it is also used to carry multicast traffic over the internet.I understand that multicast IP belongs to address which is a public IP and can be routed. Q1:Why is multicast not supported over the internet ? Why do we need to encapsulate in GRE ? Can you please explain in laymen terms ? Q2:When we use the term 'internet', what exactly does it refer to? Would it be collection of all ISPs across the world? 

By default,all the devices connected to a switch are part of same broadcast domain.They can talk to one another without the need of a layer 3 device. 

I have to make sure that the loopback interface of R1(1.0.1.1/32) is learnt on R2 but with a few constraints. Step1: The loopback of R1 is learnt in global routing table of R2 via ospf Step2: R2 and R3 are ebgp neighbors for address-family ipv4 (on interface f0/2--which is in global routing table) and address-family ipv4 vrf (on interface f0/1 which is part of vrf TEST on both R2 and R3) Step3: At R2, I redistribute the ospf learnt routes to BGP (ipv4 address-family). Step4: R3 learns the bgp routes from R2 via ebgp (with a next hop of 192.16.2.9) in global routing table. Step5: At R3, I do a route-leaking from the bgp ipv4 address family to bgp vpnv4 vrf TEST address family for 1.0.1.1/32 So, R3 has a route to 1.0.1.1/32 in vrf TEST with a next hop of 192.16.2.9 (which is in global routing table) Step 6: R2 learns again the 1.0.1.1/32 route via ebgp address-family ipv4 vrf TEST with a next hop of 192.16.1.10 Now my objective is to make sure R2 can ping the 1.0.1.1/32 via the vrf TEST(but as expected it fails) Any suggestions on how to get the above scenario working. (One of the ways,this can be done is to configure the interface f0/2 on both R2 and R3 as below: 

If the huntstop attribute is set, an incoming call does not roll over (hunt) to another ephone-dn when the called ephone-dn is busy or does not answer and a hunting strategy has been established that includes this ephone-dn. When the no huntstop command is used on the ephone-dn, the call would ring on the first ephone-dn and go through any hunting defined on the two channels in a dual-line ephone-dn before being sent to the next most preferred ephone-dn that also has a matching destination pattern. This will continue until an ephone-dn with huntstop configured is reached or no more dial peers (ephone-dns) have matching destinations patterns. The difference in configuration between overlaid ephone-dns with call waiting and overlaid ephone-dns without call waiting is that overlaid ephone-dns with call waiting use the c keyword in the button command and overlaid ephone-dns without call waiting use the o keyword. Call waiting allows phone users to know that another person is calling them while they are talking on the phone. Phone users hear a call-waiting tone indicating that another party is trying to reach them. Calls to IP phones with soft keys can be answered with the Answer soft key. Example- A Cisco Unified IP Phone 7910 (maximum two call-waiting calls) has a button configured with a set of overlaid ephone-dns with call waiting (button 1c1,2,3,4). A call to ephone-dn 1 is answered. A call to ephone-dn 2 generates call-waiting notification. Calls to ephone-dn 3 and ephone-dn 4 will wait in line and remain invisible to the phone user until one of the two original calls ends. When the call to ephone-dn 1 ends, the phone user can then talk to the person who called ephone-dn 2. The call to ephone-dn 3 issues call-waiting notification while the call to ephone-dn 4 waits in line The following example demonstrates call waiting for overlaid ephone-dns that are shared on two phones: ephone 1 button 1c1,2,3,4 ! ephone 2 button 1c1,2,3,4 

Similary for X.600 part. Q1:What exactly is the bridge group part used for?What if i remove it? Q2:I understand that any frame coming to the switch with a tag of 500, will be put onto interface Bundle-Ether1.500 and also onto interface Bundle-Ether2.500. This tag will be stripped(at ingress ) and pushed back at egress(when the frame exits these interfaces(because of symmetric command). Is that correct understanding? Q3:Bridge-domains represent ONE broadcast domain.So all the interfaces under one bridge domain are part of SAME broadcast domain? As for above, the Bundle-Ether1.500 and Bundle-Ether2.500 are part of SAME broadcast domain BD1. Is that CORRECT understanding? Q4:Why at all do we need to group these Bridge-domains? What advantage am i getting?Why are we tying all the Bridge-domains under a single bridge group? Q5:What role is l2vpn command playing in above? 

I am trying to understand the difference between address-family vpnv4 and address-family ipv4 vrf So to test the scenario, i connected 2 routers(R1 and R2) linearly back to back. R1 has the loopback as 11.11.11.11 R2 has the loopback address as 22.22.22.22 On R2, i have the vrf TEST22. On R2, i also have a static route to network 100.0.0.0 in vrf TEST22 as shown below 

From the cisco docs i have: "vPC and HSRP/VRRP Object Tracking As Figure 67 suggests, itâ€™s important not to use HSRP/VRRP link tracking in a vPC configuration. Assume HSRP/VRRP object tracking is configured on both vPC peer devices and L3 uplink failure occurs on switch 7K2. This event triggers the HSRP/VRPP object tracking and the resulting SVI with associated HSRP/VRRP configuration is set to DOWN state. So everytime 7K2 receives a frame destined to HSRP/VRRP vMAC, it bridges this frame over vPC peer-link because the other vPC peer device is able to process this frame (as SVI with associated HSRP/VRRP configuration is still in UP state). Using vPC with HSRP/VRRP object tracking may leads to traffic blackholing in case object tracking is triggered: the reason is that vPC systems will not forward a packet back on a vPC once it has crossed the peer-link (because of the vPC loop avoidance rule), except in the case of a remote vPC member port failure. " Refer the attached image: 

The Window Size field in each TCP header indicates the amount of empty space, in bytes, remaining in the receive buffer. The field is 16 bits in TCP, but with the Windows Scale option, values larger than 65535 can be used. Windows scale option increases the Window Size from 16 bit to 30 bit. Instead of changing the field size, however, the header still holds a 16 bit value, and an option is defined that applies a scaling factor to the 16 bit value. Window Scale RFC is 1323. (TCP/IP Illustrated Vol. 1.) 

There are a few more differences between seperator o and c. For further explanation you can check SRND for CME. If there is still some confusion, please leave a comment. I can explain it to you. 

I don't think this will be possible. PC Port on Phone is an access port and you can't change it to trunk port. Why don't you connect PC directly to Phone and then phone to 8 port switch. One trunk to 8-port switch from data switch and your problem is solved. 

I have a Cisco 3550. I wanted to connect a 9971(used) to it, but it is not going beyond POST. I see the keys blinking but nothing happens after that, and this happens in a loop. Could that be a problem with Phone or with Switch? Switch Information - C3550 Software (C3550-IPSERVICESK9-M), Version 12.2(44)SE6 Model number: WS-C3550-24PWR-SMI 

ICMP is the result of initiating the ping from a source to a destination.It has got nothing to do with ARP as such. But for any 2 devices to talk to each other, each device would need to know the or layer 2 address of the other device(assuming the devices are in same network; if not in same network,they need to reach their gateway at least). This is where ARP comes in. ARP says, can you give me the mac address for this IP address? ARP helps in building the control plane(say building a road), before the actual ICMP traffic in this case(the data plane) starts moving. 

Q1:As you see, my BGP neighborship is stuck in active state.From what i understand, R1 expects the neighborship packets from R2 with a source-ip of If you do on R2 for 11.11.11.11, you see that it is learnt via as . Therefore, the bgp neighborship packets sourced from R2 will use this egress source ip() Please confirm if my understanding is correct Q2:I add the following on R2. 

So essentially, as we place a router in a network and assign ip addresses, we are creating new broadcast domains. 

As you see, on R1, the route to 100.0.0.0 no longer exists. Moreover, the BGP vrf peering is in Active state. Why is this happening ? is there any relation between and ? Is it mandatory for to have neighbor activated for vrf routes to be exchanged? 

I would suggest you to connect NAS to the router instead of switch and camera also(if you have only one camera). 3 different networks would do. 

Transmission rate is not same as bandwidth. Channel Bandwidth â€“ the range of signal bandwidths allowed by a communication channel without significant loss of energy (attenuation). Channel Capacity or Maximum Data rate â€“ the maximum rate (in bps) at which data can be transmitted over a given communication link, or channel. A typical method of performing a measurement is to transfer a 'large' file from one system to another system and measure the time required to complete the transfer or copy of the file. The throughput is then calculated by dividing the file size by the time to get the throughput in megabits, kilobits, or bits per second. From the definition I would say they would be considering propagation delay also. 

Cubic functions can have both convex and concave portions, meaning that they can grow more slowly in some portions(concave) and more quickly in others(convex). In addition to that CUBIC also has a TCP friendly region that operates when window is small to ensure that CUBIC is not penalized relative to regular TCP. More specifically, the window size of standard TCP in terms of time elapsed. 

eth 2 Address: 10.0.0.0 Netmask: 255.0.0.0 = 8 Wildcard: 0.255.255.255 => Network: 10.0.0.0/8 Broadcast: 10.255.255.255 HostMin: 10.0.0.1 HostMax: 10.255.255.254 Hosts/Net: 16777214 eth 1 Address: 10.10.0.0 Netmask: 255.255.0.0 = 16 Wildcard: 0.0.255.255 => Network: 10.10.0.0/16 Broadcast: 10.10.255.255 HostMin: 10.10.0.1 HostMax: 10.10.255.254 Hosts/Net: 65534 Both are conflicting. 

I have questions regarding the following designs in my test lab: 1.Ethernet port of one switch is connected to TenGig port of the Firewall.Why would anyone do this(connecting Ethernet and Tengigabit Ethernet)? 2.N5k E1/4 (LC type) connected to E1/4(LC type) with MMF as the media. The speed shown is 10Gb. Is this possible? If so, how? 

There is a vPC domain, with vPC 20 for Sw2 and vPC 10 for Sw1. vPC peer link exists between NxOS1 and NxOS2. Suppose, Sw2 sends broadcast traffic.This broadcast traffic (after hashing) will choose any of the links while going upstream to NxOS1. Now the broadcast traffic is received on NXOS1. NxOS1 sends broadcast traffic to all ports except port20. Hence, NxOS1 will send the traffic egress via Port 10 and the Peer link. Now, the NxOS2 receives the traffic, it knows what was the status of port 10 and port 20 of NxOS1 (via CFS protocol). So, NxOS2 knows that SW1 might have received traffic from NxOS1 via Port 10 of NxOS1. NxOS2 also knows that (via CFS protocol) the broadcast traffic would have come to NxOS1(on port 20) from SW2. (I believe when the port channel is established, the system-mac of Sw2 is known to both NxOS1 and NxOS2). Hence, NxOS2 DOES NOT further send broadcast traffic(in egress direction downstream) on port 20 and port 10 of NxOS2. Q1:Please validate if my above understanding is correct. Q2:Here, CFSoE is playing a great role(for mac address synchronisation).What would happen if CFSoE stops working(assume peer link goes down)? Even then how would loop occur in above scenario?
