There seem to be many different causes for high CPU use on the host. In my case, with a Win7 guest, the solution was to disable the "VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension". Either in Settings -> Display -> Remote Display: unselect "Enable Server". Or by starting the machine with the option. 

As for 2 (make it automatic), you can't, but if you patch ssh-copy-id to avoid duplicates, it doesn't matter if you run too much. 

If you want to automate the conversion of filter files to this syntax, you can use this perl command: 

(The option makes a backup and converts the file in-place instead of to stdout) At least for filters and include/exclude options, it would be really nice to have a case-insensitive flag in rsync. Until then, the only options seem to be either the patch or the convoluted regex-like syntax. 

Microsoft documents the problem in "Error running command shell scripts that include parentheses". The solution they suggest is to use delayed expansion. 

/mount/point would usually be /media/Your_drive_label /dev/sdx is your HFS+ device Use to find which device is already mounted on which mount point. 

The title is misleading, since the author doesn't really want a full diff. He only wants to know IF 2 files are different. The distinction is important if the files are big. Checksumming methods will obviously read both files entirely. As far as I could tell, Windows' and both also read the entire files, even if there was a difference in the first bytes. As John T suggests, get GNU diffutils, which includes . With big files, will be a lot faster than COMP or FC. That is if you need it to be a command-line tool. If you can use a GUI shareware, Total Commander has a "Compare Files" command, and a "Synchronize dirs" command which can be set to compare files by content. Both are extremely fast. 

Note your system can be already unstable. It is better to avoid any reboot, until you fix. Supposed that you freed enough space, now you can try again 

Yes. You suspended it. Use in this case %2 to de-froze it. When you run a program from command line, usually you can suspend it with CTRL-Z. The system respond to you with line like 

pushd newdir ... popd adds a directory to the stack and removes one from the stack. An advantage respect is that you will choose when to come back to the signed directory, and you will not be forced to come back to the last one. Another advantage is that you can pile a number of directories and decide to which to jump. and for the information about those builtin commands. 

Your script is substantially correct if not for the character that you have to delete and for the file name that you have to repeat 

Even this can be written in the configuration file for your shell (see above). Each time with you freeze the actual situation and with you re-establish the last one freezed. Note that the has to be the last character of the line to split the command in a more readable format on two lines. Note On my system to complete a command (e.g. to navigate with ) it is enough to give the to enable the ignore case, even when is . The on is needed for the pathname expansion. It exists even the for the patterns. to read more... Help on the commands The commands and are built in of the shell. It means that to ask the manual for their use you need to use instead of . To have only a human readable output you can use 

To avoid duplicates, you can modify . I have done this to the ssh-copy-id distributed with Debian's openssh-client, which for me was version 1:6.0p1-4. In short, I modified 

For example, I use the option, which "tells rsync to look for per-directory .rsync-filter files that have been sprinkled through the hierarchy and use their rules to filter the files in the transfer." My contains lines like these to filter out these "droppings" that Macs leave behind them: 

If using a chroot jail (), check that the FTP user's home directory is indeed the directory it should be. And if the directory is a mount point or under a mount point, check that the right disk is indeed mounted there. 

I had the same problem, but could not re-install. It just failed with error code 0x80070005, and I also had the error you mention (0x80070643) in the logs. To be able to re-install, I had to first delete the whole folder as described here: 

For those who prefer to copy/paste commands rather than clicking around, run this in an elevated Command Prompt or from a batch file (as administrator): Kill the GWX.exe task: 

However, the interaction between the "Perfomance Options" / "Visual Effects" window and the registry is quite mysterious and I never found a decent reference about it. 

Note: It is released with the Affero GPL licence, one of the GNU licences, so open source, you can read on wiki too...) 

Q1: Is there any difference how I use that cable? A1 (Short): Yes, there are problems of communication over the 5mt [1],[2] (see below), and of maximum power deliverable. (The longer or thinner the cable, the lesser the final Voltage [3],[4]). For example some HDD drives need good cables (short or with a good section of the copper cable) in order to work properly, because their absorption is close to the limit of the port. Q2: Can I simply extend cable longer than 5m if no data or audio transfer is required? A2: (Short): It depends. If you use only to "deliver power" it could work if it is not involved the communication aspects. Note that if the Voltage is too low for example the battery circuit of a mobile can work not properly. (Nowadays many battery, for example, decide if they are charged checking their temperature that depends from the amperage and voltage with which they are charged: this can change their life expectancy. Moreover they can decide that the voltage is too low to have a proper charging cycle and don't start at all, or even worst to continue to switch between the charging status and the not enough to charge status).. Q2B ...I just want to feed really small usb speakers... A2B: It depends, again. If the audio arrives through a different cable, you should only experience a lower final volume and some distortion. Note that with new compliant cables (USB Power Delivery, "PD") and devices some limits are overcame. Again you can read more about on the usb site[5] and on wikipedia [6]. 

go to Account Settings -> Synchronization & Storage and uncheck "Keep messages for this account on the computer". under Account Settings -> Server Settings, take note of the relevant "Local directory". exit Thunderbird in that "Local directory" and it's subfolders, delete the mailbox files (the files which have no extension). But keep the .msf index files and the .sdb files. 

You can enable writing to HFS+ in Linux even if you didn't disable journaling. In addition to hfsplus which you already have, you need to have hfsprogs installed: 

Many players support ASS tags in .srt files. Below is an example using ASS positioning tags which work in both VLC and SMplayer in Linux, and probably in many other players and other OSes. Note that the accepted answer suggests an older version of the SSA format, using instead of . The numbers used in the older format are also different, and that format is considered deprecated. The newer format uses the numpad layout for the numbers. While SMplayer correctly displays both formats, VLC only accepts the current format. 

Indeed, the missing keys on Macbooks (and many Windows notebooks) are something extremely annoying. Normally, on Macbook keyboards, you get Home / End with fn-Left / fn-Right and PgUp / PgDown with fn-Up / fn-Down However, as you noticed, this doesn't work in Terminal apps like nano, Midnight Commander, less, etc. In Terminal, you need to add Shift to let them "pass through" to Terminal. Home : Shift-fn-Left End : Shift-fn-Right PgUp : Shift-fn-Up PgDn : Shift-fn-Down Of course, when what you really need happens to be Shift-Ctrl-Home ... forget it! (Or connect a real keyboard) And Midnight Commander users will want to know that the missing Insert key can obtained with Ctrl-T 

You can try to save what is still possible with the utility . (GNU cpio copies files into or out of a cpio or tar archive...) The command below should do the job extracting the files and recreating the directory tree: 

You can find interesting for what it concerns zombies wasted resources in the OUTPUT MODIFIERS section, and mem for memory usage: 

Note: In case doesn't exist you can create it with a simple . The will create the file if doesn't exists. If the instead exists it will append only the harmless output of empty , avoiding an unintentional deletion a such critical file, that is incidentally difficult to restore without a backup. (The following is because seldom I have to honour the meaning of my nickname, do not execute if you are in doubt). 

Updated Notes: ...and there is a space before and because in your weird () format there are spaces after the comma () so you need special care for all the commands that take only one character as separator... this fix the problem if there was an in the second string...what are you not able to find with you can try to find with or with ... Ad nauseam: 

Only a warning: and function really fast and you have no visual control of the line you are running as superuser. This can result harmful sometimes. Specially if you incur in a missprint. Let's we do a dramatic example: 

(it's the same as shirley's answer, but double-clicking .reg files over the network does not work and I have my config scripts on the server. But running a .cmd script as admin works) 

Not sure if is really needed, or if it would also work without it. Maybe it depends on the OS version. 

For some reason, the solution in an alias, as suggested by user szkj, didn't work correctly for me. While it did preserve commands executed in the MC subshell, commands entered before starting MC were lost after exiting. Finally, I use the following in , without an alias. It seems to work fine despite the fact that overwrites . 

I tried with a Samba share, but it should work the same with NFS. Indeed, copy/pasting from the "Get Info" windows does not work. However, this worked: 

Normally, Windows ignores case, but preserves it. If your filenames change case, it must be due to some program other than rsync which copied files and mangled the case during the copy. That program is probably misconfigured. Or if you use a Samba server, maybe that is misconfigured. By default, Samba also preserves the case of filenames. So, maybe you can solve the problem of filenames unexpectedly changing their case. Then you are left with "only" the problem of case-sensitivity of filters. If that ends up being your case, and you are reluctant to apply the patch suggested by Wim, you can use character classes in the filters. It's ugly and annoying, but it works: 

Of course it is more wise to avoid to write password in your commandline or in scripts... you can simply use the self-explaining option instead. A more fine solution under Linux is to put the information needed in a file named . It should be easy to find the equivalent name in the windows documentation 

It seems LibreCad print preview scales automatically the dimensions. You can check one time the fix checkbox on the preview page and then, after further modifications, it will remain fixed. So a workaround is to draw a rectangle with the size you prefer for your page, then to go to the preview page, fix it, save the file and start to work... 

Of course you can reinstall the system to be sure, but you should check even all your data when you will put on the new installed system. IMHO The possibility you were hacked with a picture preview are little. You can investigate yourself the code of the email (the more dangerous possibility) and control the library version of OpenJPEG. In theory there is always the possibility that new exploit are discovered, but it is extremely improbable that you will be the first to experiment them on your own skin. So keep the defences up and the system updated. (Save the mail and the picture in a secure place for future investigations). 

It is indeed extremely annoying that it doesn't seem possible to simply add one or more styles from your current document to the default template. However, what is possible is to copy styles from one open document to another open document. In some situations, that may be sufficient as a workaround. If you have a document open in Writer or in Calc, with the styles you need: 

As others already pointed out, your NAS most certainly cannot be used in USB slave mode. However, if you would like full access to it, you can SSh into it. Or you can mount it in your Debian server using sshfs. 

You may also want to disable "Global Search and Indexer" under Preferences -> Advanced -> General. See $URL$ for more details. 

If the drive has been mounted automatically (as it should be on a desktop system like Ubuntu), you can enable write with 

(Of course, that should be exactly the same as copying from the Get Info windows, but obviously it isn't in Lion 10.7.4). This created the 2 files you would expect on the destination: and it's resource fork . However, it also created another file which seems essential. It is displayed as in the Mac Terminal, but got a weird name on the Samba share, probably to work around the illegal trailing dot. (on my machine, Samba replaced the trailing dot with the UTF8 "private" character xEFx80xA9) Update: Even when copying from Preview, it does not always work with NFS. It does sometimes!?!... Copying the files from a FAT32 drive (which also has the extra file) to the NFS share doesn't work. What does seem to work reliably is terribly convoluted, but anyway, here it goes:
