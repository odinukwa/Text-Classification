to hide all output while booting you can boot "silent". this means all output will be redirected to tty3. edit /boot/cmdline.txt !! every thing need to be in one line!! 

does the response give the IP of the Raspberry? If not there is a DNS issue. If you know the IP of your Raspberry try to connect using the IP: 

To stop a service doesn't prevent the deamon to start the service on boot. For this you should deactivate the service to come up on all run levels A simple command for this on raspbian is 

If it doesn't work or if you don't know the IP of your Raspberry, use HDMI and Keyboard. Login and check your IP: 

last days one of my Pi2 crashed over night. At morning i realized the Pi is down (no response on network, plugged to monitor and keyboard did not give any response) I plug out/in the power supply to restart the Pi. The red and green LED are on bright and steady. Okay first thought was a corrupt SD card, i put the card in another Pi2 and it booted without any issue. Back in the faulty Pi again both LEDs are on. I tried another SD card with a fresh downloaded Raspbian image but no changes - no boot. Changed the power supply no changes... seems to be dead. I was quite busy and couldn't investigate more so left the Pi without Power for 2 Days. Today i decided to throw it in the trash but before I plugged again the power and it booted. I rebooted serval times and the Pi seem not to have an issue. Now it runs since 7hrs in normal condition. 

The problem with using is that the variable we're trying to export does persist across to the root shell. I'm not really sure why. 

Yes, there are logs for everything. If you connect a new device to the Pi then the module being loaded will show in . Eg; 

is simply a section of memory on the processor where you can store whatever information you like; these are called general purpose registers. We write the location of the GPIO controller to this location so that we can reuse it later, as we would usually do using a variable in high level programming. I think the value 0x20200000 actually refers to the first memory location in the table on page 90. You'll notice that before we write to the register we increment it by 4, giving us (see table), the register that controls a few pins, including the one we want to write to. Does that help at all? 

The best solution I've seen to this is the X10i - Real Time Control Board for Raspberry Pi from Heber. 

I believe the problem is with Awesome WM. It is written mostly in Lua, which runs on the Lua Virtual Machine. Since there is an abstraction away from the hardware, performance must take a slight hit (citation needed). Even if you are using a distribution that supports Hard Float calculations, the Lua VM doesn't. So this will not improve performance as much as with other Window Managers. As I've said, you can attempt to improve what you can in Awesome by disabling any extra features such as transparency and by increasing the available RAM to the GPU (forget about swap), but perhaps you might want to look at other WMs. I use Xmonad, which is simple like Awesome and is also tiling, so you might get on well with that. It runs on Haskell I believe, and performance for me has been great. Sources: 

I am running "Sixaxis" PS3 controller on RetroPi (RPi 3). In the beginning i had some trouble but following this tutorial i could pair the controller without issues. They are working great with the RetroPi. On this Github site is a list of other controllers and how connect them to the RetroPi. But mostly there are no comments how good they are working later. Imho the PS3 controller feels little bit more laggy than on the PS3. This is my very subjective experience... maybe this would disappear with some tweaks. 

There are many approaches. Guess the simplest is to use a HTTP form that send to a cgi (in your case directly a python script) You need to 

The question has already a great age but has been pumped by Community. Some months ago I stumbled again about a Linux distribution that i used a decade ago. This project offers a rpi packages. Unfortunately it is still in development and not feature complete. Here are is a tutorial (translated to English w/ Google). As others here mentioned, a PRi as DSL cant replace a dedicated hardware - it works more as PoC. 

I fear you need to find out by your own. When i had this question for my RPi2, I stumbled over Siege and httperf. I followed this example to run the benchmarks - just instead of plain html pages i requested php files. There performance of the web server is also depending on the cgi modules you will choose. A plain vanilla lighttpd may be faster than a vanilla Apache. If you are choosing/configuring the CGI improper, this might be change and the Apache can outperform the Lighty. 

Replace the IP with the address of your Raspberry Pi. Now you should be able to move your mouse between the two X sessions by moving your mouse off the screen to the right (east). 

This is an power-saving thing. Firstly, you may need to install , a lightweight application that controls some settings. 

All of the files in the directory are actually symlinks to their counterparts in the directory. For some reason it looks as if the file that is linked to is not there any more. You should be able to tell if I'm right by executing the following, which I think will give you some errors about : 

The Raspberry Pi contains a . This file is read by the GPU before the ARM core is initialised. It can be used to set various system configuration parameters. Which can be used for overclocking. 

The problem is that the X session for the superuser doesn't know what the cookie is. After logging into the Pi execute the following: 

It seems to provide the tools you need, but I have no idea why there isn't a package called . However, if you look in the package archive you can find this: $URL$ Perhaps one of the headers packages in that directory will be for the kernel you need. Unfortunately that is all the information I can currently offer, as I have not yet installed Raspbian myself, although it is on my TODO list. 

Yes this should be possible. You can link to different wpa_supplicant files in /etc/network/interfaces like 

and a script that scrape the SSISD form the output and write this to a text file. Use this text file to provide a select list in the config web site. This "get ssid" script run periodical you can use some ajax to refresh the config web page... ... but this is maybe just an approach if you have many users or like to fiddle around. ;) 

With this little change the buttonStatus should be set correctly. Edit:fixed elsif .1 as C Malasadas suggested in comments. 

There can be different points why you cant connect your PI. The error message indicates that the domain can't be resolved. Try: 

If using MSSQL you can also create a CSV file with python and import it using bulk insert or SSIS. I would recommend the python module - but if you don't have a SQL user with the permission to connect and insert into your table MS SQL tools are a great alternative. for inserting a variable you can try something like this: 

Pushing the button for more than 4 seconds, there are two valid IF conditions. You can use else if and use a range for the second condition: 

can be an option to get some more memory during the apt-get process. If you run your raspberry without GUI try to reduce the memory allocated for graphics. 

Yes indeed. Starting GDM At Boot You need to edit so that knows that it should boot directly into runlevel 5 (default for X11) when it starts. 

I don't see any reason why you can't buy a standard breadboard, or a few of them, and then set them up how you are asking. Breadboards usually have jigsaw type connections so that you can clip them all together. You can then just connect up your electronics and build your model on top of it all. 

My first thought would be this is a firmware issue. Try updating the firmware using Hexxeh's tool, it appears to be the easiest way for Debian users to update (someone please correct me if I'm wrong). You can download the tool from his GitHub repository here. Arch Linux users should already have the latest firmware, as it is installed with a standard system update. 

As far as I know no-one is providing a purpose built Raspberry Pi faraday cage. However, making one yourself is fairly simple as the core component is usually a simple aluminium mesh. Here's a decent tutorial that you can follow. 

He suggests that the script for doing this will be available from his GitHub but unfortunately I cannot find it. This appears to be his personal website if you want to contact him for the solution. However, I doubt the script is very complex and wouldn't take much writing from scratch.
