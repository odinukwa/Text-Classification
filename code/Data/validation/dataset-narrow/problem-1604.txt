I have Motion installed on one PI and wondered if it was possible to easy duplicate the install process, with dependencies, on a another pi without either: 1) Installing and configuring it again 2) Removing the SD card and making a backup of the image, then duplicating the image to the second PI I remember it was difficult to get it working with the NOIR PI-cam, and I cannot remember exactly what I did to get it to work. 

It then temporarily displayed a new "image" window. b) But when I changed the to the script saves a jpg but didn't display a new "image" window. c) With this in mind, I then tried in LXTerminal on the desktop, which didn't display the "image" window, but did produce the jpg and when I did it takes the image but i get the error again: 

Could I reliably mount the same network drive on two PIs connected to the same internal network? At the moment, I have one PI moving pictures from its saved location, to its mounted network drive, linked to a Box account, each time its camera detects movement. What I'm concerned about is, if I duplicate the above system, I'll have two mounted devices pointed to one external drive; with the possibility of both PIs trying to upload files possibly at the same time. I'm using davfs2 to mount my network drive and have set up my PI like this 

The Raspberry Pi's micro USB jack is for the supply voltage only. Its data pins are not connected to any circuitry on Pi let alone anything "smart" (just like @goldilocks comment suggests). Reference: schematics @ raspberrypi.org for A, B and B+. The schematics for the Pi 2 are not available there as of now but given the documented changes it seems very unlikely that the micro USB jack now serves any other purpose then power supply. So when it comes to power supplies the Pi is quite dumb and prefers dumb chargers too. 

Mind you that you will have to switch a voltage in the range of 50 to 100 V - 30 times the forward voltage of each individual LED - thus a high voltage is required that poses the risk of electrical shock. That alone might be reason enough to change the plan. Furthermore it will not work directly off the GPIO pin but requires an additional switching transistor that is able to handle a voltage that high. Other than that a circuit of series LED with a single resistor is, in principle, ok. For this application however I would suggest to limit the number of LEDs connected in series according to the voltage of a suitable power source, i.e. 12 or 24 V, whatever is available. The number of resulting strings then determines the number of GPIO pins required. Again connecting this many LEDs directly to the GPIO pins might not be a good idea either depending on the desired current through the LEDs and the current the Pi can provide. See Raspberry Pi Power Limitations and What are the Electrical Specifications of GPIO pins? for more (emphasis mine) 

it works, so this would appear that my pi doesn't like popleft() 1) Is this the case, i'm not sure how to check if popleft is available in Python 3.2.3? 2) How do I fix this? 3) if poleft isn't available in the newer version of python, then is there an equivalent? there an 

Firstly, I've googled around, but got myself horribly confused; hence this question. I have a headless/keyboardless Raspberry pi with a camera board on it, that I connect to via ssh using my windows PC. I'm trying to display a window, on my windows PC, with a picture taken using a python script and opencv2, but am having problems doing that. I am using putty and xming, and can see the raspberry pi's desktop. I run the script via the terminal on the PI's desktop. The below script saves, and rotates the jpg, but doesn't display the picture on my pc and gives an error: 

At the moment I'm running two PIs with the popular software Motion, delivering webcam content to the internet. I'm port mapping the two external ports to the internal ports on my router, to give external access to the two streams. These two PIs have a version of Motion that allows authentication of the streams within the Motion software. However, I have recently setup another PI with the the latest version of Motion, but without the ability to authenticate the stream. I know there's a patch for this, but was wondering: 1) Is it's possible to authenticate the three PIs, via my own Apache web server on one of the PIs; rather than from within Motion's settings? 2) If this is possible,then would I only have to port map my router to one port, the one with the web server on it? 3) Would I just use the same internal addresses link (102.168.1.90:port_number_setup_in_motion), to access the stream on the external address website? I think this below may be close to what I'm looking for, but not sure where to place it in the appachie2 file structure. 

That cable is most likely a DisplayPort-to-HDMI cable not a HDMI-to-DisplayPort cable (mind the direction). While there are DP ports able to support HMDI signals (DisplayPort Dual-mode) HDMI does not support DP directly. Since HDMI data transmission is very different from DP there will be no simple (passive) cable that just re-routes some signal lines on the different connectors. DisplayPort@Wikipedia: "The DisplayPort signal is not compatible with DVI or HDMI. However, Dual-mode DisplayPorts are designed to transmit a single-link DVI or HDMI 1.2/1.4 protocol across the interface through the use of an external passive adapter that selects the desired signal and converts the electrical signaling from LVDS to TMDS." and HDMI@Wikipedia: "DisplayPort ports can be made so that they are compatible with single-link DVI and HDMI 1.4.[200] Compatibility is achieved with DisplayPort Dual-mode ports, which are marked with the ++DP logo, using attached passive adapters". So while these cables can connect a DP appliance to a HDMI display it's not possible to connect a HDMI appliance (such as the RPi) to a DP display. 

and it appeared to work without having to enter my username and password manually. so i then tried on the command line: 

I am using the raspberry pi NOIR board to supply a Python motion detection script. This "motion detection script" uses opencv2 to grab, modify and detect motion. I wanted to extend the motion detection script, by adding a continuous live feed, within the motion detection script, but have run into problems. The problem I have, is I cannot have the two operations accessing the NOIR camera board together, because this upsets the PI. 1) Is it some how possible to have two scripts grabbing frames together using the below code in each? 

Iv'e done some more tests and this is what ive found out, so far: a) I logged in to my pi via xming and putty as user pi. I then created a shortcut to the script, and ran it, which worked and created an image on the desktop of my pi. 

I recently tried inserting a 5M USB extension cable in between my WIFI dongle and my PI, which didn't work, so I removed immediately; but the PI still wouldn't connect following a reboot for ages. Can adding a 5 meter USB extension cable to the WIFI dongle cause problems even after it's removed? 

So even if we assume that the Pi operates on roughly 0.5 to 0.8 A (see Current draw for +/2/0 models) that leaves just 1.7 A in the worst case. That's already short of the expected 2 A for the motor driver. It'll be worse if more basic peripherals such as WiFi/keyboard/mouse/HDMI are used or further USB gadgets are connected. Not to mention the potential trouble of conducted EMI. Ideally you would properly decouple the power supply of the power part (motor controller) and the logic part (Pi). It is furthermore noteworthy that the Pi is not regulating the 5V rail on the GPIO header. All it does is feeding it through the protective circuit with the aforementioned polyfuse. So the quality of the voltage is depending on the power supply either way. There is nothing to be gained from routing it through the Pi instead of direct wiring. 

The schematics @ raspberrypi.org (I checked Revision 2.1 for type B) do not suggest any deliberate measures to limit the current to the SD card. Vdd of the SD card is directly connected to the 3.3V rail which leads to the respective voltage regulator. There are of course some possibilities that might limit the current: 

where I cannot see two processes trying to access the port 1991 on 192.168.1.61. Am I doing anything incorrectly? I'm still confused what could be happening with the "address already in use" error listed above. Another edit resulting from comments I start the socket using the command: which calls the CamHandler class to deal with constructing the stream. the CamHandler class looks like this: 

Iv'e just managed to get a WIFI re connect script working and have been testing it by pulling the power on my router and re connecting it; sO far so good. It all seems to reconnect, but when I try and access the Apache server from my mobile phone, I get server not found! It works from within my WIFI, but not from the net. I haven't changed anything on my router, apart from rebooting it a few times I found this article on the net and wondered if it's not the script but noip's DUC (dynamic update client) not working. I don't seem to be able to log in to noip.com either! If NoIP is compromised/blocked by Microsoft, will things go back to normal, or do I have to search for an alternative free Dynamic update client. Any ideas? I don't think it's the script, as I can get access if I find out my external IP address, but hear it is anyway, just in case anyone can spot a reason why this may have upset my Apache server. 

1 Usually a series resistor (in the range of 1..10 kOhm) between the GPIO output pin and the base of the transistor (supposedly connected somehow to the "IN" pin) would be the way to go. From the trace on the board it would seem that the middle resistor (1 kOhm) is attached to the "IN" pin serving exactly this purpose. You could easily check this with an Ohmmeter or following the traces on the board. If it does - no need for any external components. 

Looking at the schematics of Model A and B Revision 2.1, page 2, as well as the schematics of Model B+ Revision 1.2, page 1, we find that the pin 14 at the HDMI connector is not connected. This pin is responsible for the HDMI-Ethernet-Channel (HEC) for HDMI 1.4 and reserved for HDMI 1.0-1.3. So there's no HDMI ethernet connected on the Pi A/A+/B/B+ (and presumably neither on the Pi 2 and the Pi Zero). 

There are however ways to do what you want. This tutorial (source of the figures shown below) has it outlined quite nicely. The circuit looks like this (see last paragraph on the missing current limiting resistor in these schematics, add resistor at your own discretion): 

Thanks Bex for your help :) I think it's working now by changing the uid and gid to motion in the fstab davfs mount command. I used this page for reference. I also noticed that the mounted directory had 0777 permissions with user pi, then I modified the fstab file then did a reboot; to test the re mount. Following the reboot the permissions changed to 0755 with user motion ; this may explain how the permissions could change, as you suspected. I'm happy, thanks again, Reggie :) P.S. I didn't change the rw to rwx after looking at the above link, i didn't think it was valid. 

Oh dear! I didn't read the comments, the first comment suggested i chainge the type of quotation marks, and bingo it worked, Sorry! This worked: 

I tried , but that made no difference, then i tried which did the job! Thanks Rune Vikestad for suggesting this, I can now install packages again. Does this suggest i had too much installed on my 4GB sd card or something else? 

See here for what kind of adaptor to look for - HDMI to DVI-D cables, or HDMI cables with an DVI-D adapters should work though, see also here. Some posts on the internet claim that it might be necessary to tweak the Pi's config () to make DVI-D work properly, e.g. here setting hdmi_drive to choose between HDMI and DVI modes: 

An external driver should do the trick, e.g. an I2C driver/multiplexer or the ULN2003 darlington transistor array (or here or here) or the ULN2803. 

From Petroblock: "The RetroPie SD-card image is a ready-to-use image that provides a full installation of all systems and functions that are supported by the RetroPie Setup Script." So I take it, that one just installs this image to the SD card and that is it. 

The Music Player Daemon MPD or Mopidy certainly allow you to do exactly this. Both can be set up on virtually any of the Raspberries' OS and offer Jukebox functionality while maintaining you to use the Pi for other tasks too. A wide range of clients to allow for the remote control from the local machine or remote appliances such as tablets or smart phones. Those clients are available with command line, graphical or web based interfaces. There will be one to serve your needs. 

1) has it frozen, or just taking a long time? 2) how long shall i leave it like this? 3) Would it brick my PI if i pulled the power? Please advise this worried novice. 

2) Is it possible to modify the server script to incorporate the CV2 motion detection stuff, and have it continually detecting motion, regardless of the state of the server? 3) If I have two scripts, and only have the motion detection script grabbing a img (numpy array), how could I pass this img to the server script for display over the web? I hope I've made myself clearer... 

These ips aren't either of my pis on the network, so i'm guessing they'e my Laptop. The bit i'm interested in is the "crash","down and "pts/o". Could someone please explain what these are? 

When i use the web interface (mmaltest) on motion it doesn't appear to change the operation of motion. It remembers the values i change on the web interface, so looks like it's working, but is's not transferring the values across when i look using terminal. 1) where does motion look for its motion.conf file? I've seen a conf file in etc/motion.conf and /ect/motion/motion.conf; which one is motion using? 2)if motion runs as user motion, and the permissions are set to 0777 can user pi see /change the motion.conf file?
