I'm emailing someone a draft version of a WordPress post. The post includes youtube videos and tweets. In WordPress to get the YouTube video to embeds, or the tweet to display properly you just paste the URL, no hassle. Is it possible to get this same functionality in an email? Can I make use of the oEmbed standard this way? I should say I'm talking directly about using the oEmbed functionality, not 'hey how to I put a youtube link into an email'. 

it works fine from the command line with 'python temp.py' and `sudo python temp.py' (all it needs to do is display the growl notification) I open up crontab with 'crontab -e' (i'm on OSX if that helps. I add the line 

You may be looking in ever-so slightly the wrong place (I did exactly this last week) Gmail's settings let you show/hide labels as you mention - but that's just for the UI, over to the right there is the 'show in IMAP' checkbox that lets you control if, say, your phone can see it. 

In my dataset we have many groups writing content. We regualarly take a snapshop of the number of words written. Groups work over a five day Monday to Friday period and we're interested to chart their progress. The data in excel looks like this (the last column is time+weekday to give a 'equivelent distance into the week' measurement) 

I'm running a ASUS EEE 701 laptop with the stock linux OS. I was (and still am) having problems with a cron not running - so I went to look at the logs - and it turns out that none of the logs have been updated in a little while (see picture) - the time is still correct - any idea why the logs aren't updating (and possibly thus the cron)? 

Usually the communications (an the authentication more) with the router are ciphered so it's hard to obtain the text. A good tool to start is Wireshark. A packet analyzer that helps you to analyze network traffic. It's a very powerfull tool but it's not easy to use. You will be able to see the authentication packets, but you will not be able to decrypt it. Another way to obtain the user/password is doing a "man in the middle attack", but be care, it's illegal do this in a third person network. 

To allow file and printer sharing the networks should be visible. If you change the subnet mask to 255.255.0.0 the PC with the IP 192.168.137.1 should see the devices in the subnet 192.168.1.x It depends of the subnet mask. If they are not in the same subnet you will need to configure a VPN or similar to allow visibility between devices. 

It depends of your needs. If you want a more stable solution with better performance the best option is to install an access point connected to the main router with an ethernet cable. This is more work due to the installation of the cable, but this is the best solution in terms of performance. On the other hand, if you install a repeater you don't need to wire your house, but your wireless speed will be reduced a 50%. An access point could work as a repeater, but the configuration is harder and the speed loose also apper with the wireless mode. 

When I do, I edit in vim, but without my normal vimrc - I could load it with a command but I'd like to have it load up automatically - what am I missing? Extra information - I'm a user on the system, I don't have admin rights.... 

I quite often tether my mac though my phone and obviously this results in less bandwidth being available. Is it possible to have a browser set up to use the smallest possible amount of bandwidth? What are the major things to turn off(on) to reduce the amount of data I'm piping though the machine. Note: I'm actually NOT concerned about cost - I'm completely concerned with speed and responsiveness... 

When printing from Chrome (Version 21.0.1180.82 - OSX) I get an inconvenient print dialog, where chrome tries to take control of the printing away from the OS - is there a way to disable this permanently? I've tried using the suggestions at $URL$ and $URL$ and didn't get very far... :( 

I have a long Latex document with many sections. I'd like to check that all sections of the document are filled in. So I search for any time there is a '}' ending a section title, somewhitespace, and then a '\' starting the next section (This is far from a perfect search, but it's fine by me.) In vim I use 

to my .bash_profile file. This worked generally as expected, but I've found a problem with resizing windows. So I start my terminal window as so: 

Your question is ambiguos but I will try to help you. If you have been infected by a ransomware you are in trouble. This malware cyphers all your data and asks you to pay if you want to recover it. If it's the case the only factible way to recover your information is through a security copy or with the previous version of files. You can also recover the files if they were plaved in a cloud synchronized foolder (Dropbox, Mega, Drive, ...) I highly recoomend you to do copies of your files periodically, on the cloud or in a backup disk and have a good antivirus updated in yor PC. If this is not the case please, explain your problem with more detail. Angel Sanchis 

The windows disk manager has many fails. I reccomend you something more powerfull like AOMEI Partition Manager. If it doesnt work you could try to format the USB from linux. 

I had the same issue and I could update to windows 10 in my HP laptop, but no without problems. When I updated I had problems with boot (the computer changes the loader to windows boot loader instead of grub) and when I changed to use grub the windows MBR becomes corrupt and I had to solve the problem with a repair image and using the command fixmbr... This solves the problem temporally because each time the bios was updated the default loader changed to windows instead of grub. Nowadays I'm working fine with windows loader instead of grub. Sumarizing: 1- Will it work? Yes, but probably not in the first try. 2- Is there any chance I will break something? Yes, but with a repair disk and a time probably you could repair it. 3- What do I need to back up to make sure I can go back if something goes wrong? The most important is to have a repair disk and a copy of all your important data in case you have to reinstall the OS. Here you have a more detailed guide on how to upgrade.
