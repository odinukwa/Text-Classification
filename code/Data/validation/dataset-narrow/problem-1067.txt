Searches the man pages for your serchword, regex support included. I can never remember how to spell ncmpcpp, so by 

Avoiding the problem is technically a solution. Make the server headless, ssh in on a different computer over 3 different monitors, use tmux to break those monitors into screens, boom, 9 windows at once. 

made a new resolv.conf above, same problem EDIT2 $URL$ nss-mdns was blocking it the whole time. Closing. 

Use shellshock to send an echo to /etc/passwd (or sudoers(But, I don't know how difficult it would be to Remove a comment. I thought echo could only add)) to create a user with identifier 0. unlimited access root or not. How one would create such a carefully crafted command is beyond me. Alternatively, it could very well be possible to chroot into it from a live environment and edit sudoers from there. Not sure because yo said that even root couldn't get in. I don't know how catastrophic it would be to env x='() { :;}; rm /etc/passwd' bash -c "You've done it now" I also don't know if your distro provides the means to Very Similar to this. Solution could be there. 

As you can see in the lsblk, I have separate boot partitions in arch and gentoo on /dev/sda 3 and 5 respectively. but, even when all partitions are mounted, grub and os-prober do not detect /boot partitions for either, leaving both systems unbootable for obvious reasons. I am on a Linux mint setup so I have access to the debian and ubuntu repos. I use GPT partition layout, i;m okay losing my gentoo, I don't want to reinstall arch, and I have one usb lying around to boot from, and one sdcard that can be used for file storage that MUST NOT be overwritten. I tried using bootrepair in a livecd, but when I did, it made mint bootable, but crippled gentoo and arch. Both can be accessed by chroot, and I was able to connect to the box this morning by SSH. I havn't been able to connect by SSH recently, but that isn't my problem. BTW, no problems compiling from source, just let me know where to get the code, and dependencies so I don't have to waste more time. Ive done several kernel compiles, both with and without cheating, so no problems there if I need to. I know that I'm missing something trivial, that, in hindsight, will seem obvious. 

my computer started crashing to a completely black display where it would try and restart immediately. First it was happening during a game only and i thought it was some memory leak within the game that was causing it. After a day i tried again and everything was back to normal. But then tonight it started happening all the time and it even crashed once while i was in the BIOS. This obviously helped a lot with the diagnosis because i now i know for a certainty that it's hardware related. So i tried to play around with the RAM, i own 12 gigs of ram half of which are around a year older than the other half. So i played around with the DIMM orientations till finally it kept happening even when i was down to 6 gigs of ram. Mind you at one point i had 6 gigs installed but only 4 gigs showing up as usable, which is what lead me to believe it was the RAM or the DIMM. I currently have 4 x 2gig triple channel memory sticks installed, but windows only shows 6 gigs, of course it should show 8. I had previously thought it was one of the DIMM channels, but now it seems to be random. As a result, I am now a bit stumped. I know its not my gfx card, the chances of a CPU malfunction are extremely slim, and i've had normal temperatures always, i run a liquid loop too. I've ruled out the RAM sticks that i own, well not all of them, but the random DIMM slots malfunctioning doesn't seem to be fit that situation. My last two places to turn my attention are the motherboard and my PSU. I own an ASUS Rampage III Extreme and i know these things are notorious for causing problems from nowhere. My PSU is a Corsair HX 1000W and i'm more inclined to thinking that its not the PSU but i'm not sure, i just trust corsair more. Also, there are no Error reports, only sometimes does Windows report that something bad went wrong, i'm sure there are memory dumps, but i'm not sure what you guys would need.

I'd like some automated method of converting the following URL into a format I can read on my Kindle (i.e. .mobi or PDF). $URL$ The output would have to have the first level of articles included (about 10 blog entries). 

I'm wondering what reasons could there be for this? Is there a log I can check to see what was actually installed? 

If you want cloud backup, then I prefer Amazon S3 plus some backup program such as 2BrightSparks SyncBackPro or CloudBerry. They will both handle synchronization issues seamlessly (SyncBackPro has more powerful features, however its not as easy to use out of the box). 

I have an ethernet wall socket in one room which is wired to another ethernet wall socket in another room. Everything appears to be connected up correctly, but it does not appear to be functioning. Here are photos of the wiring. Room 1 Wiring 

Sometimes, I find myself typing out a lot of text from a screen capture. Its quite tedious. Is there an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program out there that would allow me to quickly convert the something like a screen capture, or the contents of the Windows clipboard (a bitmap), into text? 

Right click in the blank area below the flower, and select "Properties", then play with the settings to switch the files back on. 

I have a Hex-core Xeon X5650 running Windows 7 x64. I'm currently doing simultaneous compression of three NTFS hard drives, 2TB each, with the commands: 

The other guy said to use php imagemagick, but from the linux commandline, the imagemagick conversion binary is called convert. If I have a 5 page pdf in Doc/pdf/test.pdf, and I need to make Doc/png/testpage1.png, the command is as follows: The leaves you with 

Also interesting is that when I try to connect directly with an ip address, with links for example, it acknowledges that google owns the connection, and then refuses to connect. The error appears I tried the solution from ping can't resolve hostname, but nslookup can but that didn't work, even though I'd recently configured avahi. Here's my resolv.conf 

The address of BLOCKED is the address of the target server us-east.privateinternetaccess.com = The next strategy I will try is to use L2TP/IPSEC using openswan, but i fear that it will go badly. I feel that no tool from linux may reach the target server, as when I was attempting to use the socks proxy provided by PIA to download the software itself, the proxy tool failed. TL;DR VPN can't connect to remote server through OpenDNS. What do? 

Are the buttons mapped to the appropriate functions? ControlPanel>System>Power>Change What Power Buttons Do > Hibernate button: "$Action" sleep button: "$Action" etc. Example on Win7 laptop. I know that it is nether win 8 nor a desktop with hibernate and sleep buttons but the principle is the same. $URL$ 

I run Arch-Linux on a Intel i3 processor w/ x64 architecture. I installed arch Linux and other than gdm failing and preventing me from booting, it went pretty smoothly. For the longest time, I used two Desktop environments: root ran KDE, and I used Xfce4. I had it configured to start x on log in for both of us. I recently had decided to switch to KDE, but when I did, my left click stopped working. Not immediately either. I was able to add Konsole and one application to my favorites before my device developed Lou Gherig's. I can move the cursor around with both devices, but my left click, and my right click have been disabled on both touchscreen and mouse. I would revert to the last functioning state, but to open konsole, I need to click the Icon. I can't summon it with because I need to click in the text bar; and brought it up, but I couldn't focus into it, nor drop in a cursor to do the command line revision. I can't ssh into it because WiFi is disabled by default. The next viable option is to boot into a live OS, chroot into it and run the commands, but it is an arduous, repetitive, and time consuming task; even if it works on the first attempt. I can't go by Ethernet, because there is no Ethernet in my house, and to get the IP address, I need to, in console, I have to type ip addr show; but I can't do that for the previously mentioned reason. 

I'd like a better method to import .csv files into Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2. The default import wizard maps everything, by default, to a varchar(50), even when its quite obvious that its a columm of numbers. It also lacks support for normalizing data, or mapping columns into different tables. In short, I need something better. Your recommendations? 

Its getting reasonable compression: up to 40:1, and typically 2:1. The resulting CPU load is only about 3% Does anyone know why is the CPU load so low? Does anyone know if the Win7 realtime compression/decompression kernel is using SSE3 or SSSE3 or SSE4.2 instructions behind the scenes? 

PowerPoint 2007 used to display a list of miniature slides down the left hand side, which could be used for navigation and cut/paste. This list has disappeared - any ideas on how to get it back? I've been through every option on the Ribbon, multiple times, and can't seem to find the option to turn this back on. 

I'd like to stop portable USB storage devices from being used on my computer. Its just too easy for someone to copy confidential data from my hard drive to a USB flash drive. Is there a way to install a program on Windows 7, so that if an unknown USB drive is inserted, it asks for a password before it can be mounted and used? 

There are some methods to do automated login using the Bluetooth connection to your phone. Unfortunately, after evaluating about 8 solutions, all of them (without exception) were buggy and didn't work well. Seems odd, as the script to do this is only about 8 lines of code. Market opportunity, anyone? 

The drivers are currently in no state to be called anything but beta drivers. The support is abysmal. However, reinstall them using these methods. But before you do, make sure you purge the current drivers using: 

You dont need to mark bad sectors manually. Hard disks have a pool of spare, good sectors. When bad sectors are found they are automatically flagged and replaced by spare, good ones. All this is invisible to the user. FYI, you can use tools like Crystaldiskinfo and HD tune to monitor bad sectors, if the drive is SMART enabled (most drives are). However, please also run a hdd diagnostic (depending on your hdd brand). Harddrive diagnostic Tools and services - Tacktech.com A few bad sectors are normal after a period of use. You should backup critical data from that disk on a priority basis. Unless the bad sector count is extremely high, keep a watch over it, particularly for sudden increases. When that happens, be prepared to order a new drive. 

This creates a tarball of the 2 files file1 and file2. As i said earlier you can throw things at the tarball and it will still be fine!

Yes, the new SSE4.2 instruction set in the Intel i7 and Intel Xeon X5650 can be used to speed up compression. Given that my CPU usage is 3% while simultaneously compressing three 2TB hard drives, Win7 is almost certainly using SSE4.2 behind the scenes for NTFS sector level compression.

Unfortunately, this is not as simple as just installing the .NET 2.0 runtime, because its already installed. If I run the recommended installers for .NET 2.0 or .NET 3.5 SP1, it exits silently. Events leading to problem: 

What I have tried Room 1 has the internet router. An ethernet cable connects the router to the ethernet wall socket. Room 2 has a laptop. An ethernet cable connects the laptop to the ethernet wall socket. If I connect the laptop directly to the internet router, it can browse the internet. If I connect the laptop to a internet router via said ethernet wall socket, it does not work. I have used a multimeter to check that each colored wire is properly seated in its socket. I touched the tip of the probe to the end of the wire, and the tip of the other probe to the two cutters that go through the insulation to the wire underneath. Update It works perfectly now, after following the answer by @Dwayne Reid. This practical example has helped me understand more about the physics that run our world. Update 2016-03-30 9 months on, and it's still working solidly. @Dwayne Reid and @Charles Cowie, thank you again! Update 2017-09-23 Over 2 years later, and it's still working brilliantly. @Dwayne Reid and @Charles Cowie, if I could buy you a beer, I would!
