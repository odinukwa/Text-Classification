I had a situation today where I restarted my computer and it said I needed to check the disk for consistancy. About 10 minutes later (at "1%" complete), I gave up and decided to let it run when I go home. For comparison, my home computer uses Ext4 for all of the partitions, and the disk checks (which run around once week) only take a couple seconds. I remember reading that having fast disk checks was a priority, but I don't know how they could do that. So, how does Ext4 do disk checks so fast? Is there some huge breakthrough in doing this after NTFS came out (~10 years ago)? Note: The NTFS disk is ~300 GB and the Ext4 disk is ~500 GB. Both are about half full. 

Another update: GNOME 3 supports window snapping out-of-the-box. It doesnâ€™t have a taskbar though, so there's no possibility for window previews. 

Doesn't Windows come with ftp? I found these instructions. You should do ftp releases.mozilla.org instead of the IP address they list though (they're listing ftp.mozilla.org which is for developers). 

Are you sure you're in the correct web group? On Ubuntu this probably means running alternately, www might have incorrect permissions. Make sure it's set so that group members have read/write access: . 

(it's the same as shirley's answer, but double-clicking .reg files over the network does not work and I have my config scripts on the server. But running a .cmd script as admin works) 

This seems to be Bug #1736116 "[SRU] Host with kernel 4.13 freezes when starting a VM with VirtualBox" There is now a fix in the virtualbox packages version 5.1.34, available in the in the xenial-proposed repository, and hopefully soon in the main repository. For a quick copy/paste solution, this worked for me: 

Not sure if is really needed, or if it would also work without it. Maybe it depends on the OS version. 

I do have write access to the file. The problem surfaced because files copied to the remote don't get the original's timestamp, but the time of when the copy was done. If I ssh to the server, I can also change the timestamp without trouble. It only fails through sshfs. 

Try the "MagicSLR" extension. You can add a "Send Later button" or use it to replace the Send button. 

Indeed, the missing keys on Macbooks (and many Windows notebooks) are something extremely annoying. Normally, on Macbook keyboards, you get Home / End with fn-Left / fn-Right and PgUp / PgDown with fn-Up / fn-Down However, as you noticed, this doesn't work in Terminal apps like nano, Midnight Commander, less, etc. In Terminal, you need to add Shift to let them "pass through" to Terminal. Home : Shift-fn-Left End : Shift-fn-Right PgUp : Shift-fn-Up PgDn : Shift-fn-Down Of course, when what you really need happens to be Shift-Ctrl-Home ... forget it! (Or connect a real keyboard) And Midnight Commander users will want to know that the missing Insert key can obtained with Ctrl-T 

I was looking at System Monitor on Linux and noticed that Firefox is using 441 MB of memory, and several other applications are using 274, 257, 232, etc (adding up to over 3 GB of virtual memory). So I switch over to the Resources tab, and it says I'm using 462 MB of memory and not touching swap. I'm confused. What does the virtual memory amount mean then if the programs aren't actually using it. I was thinking maybe memory they've requested but aren't using, but how would the OS know that? I can't think of any "I might need this much memory in the future" function.. 

On Linux, the command is either or . is generally recommended, since on some systems, will actually kill all processes. 

I don't know how to do the snap effect.. EDIT: This describes a way to make Compiz do something Aero-snap-like. According to this: 

On Linux there's a filesystem called tmpfs, which is basically a RAM disk. As its name suggests, it's frequently used for , because that folder only contains files that don't need to persist on reboot. Live CDs use a RAM disk for their entire hard drive. 

As others already pointed out, your NAS most certainly cannot be used in USB slave mode. However, if you would like full access to it, you can SSh into it. Or you can mount it in your Debian server using sshfs. 

To avoid duplicates, you can modify . I have done this to the ssh-copy-id distributed with Debian's openssh-client, which for me was version 1:6.0p1-4. In short, I modified 

If using a chroot jail (), check that the FTP user's home directory is indeed the directory it should be. And if the directory is a mount point or under a mount point, check that the right disk is indeed mounted there. 

(Of course, that should be exactly the same as copying from the Get Info windows, but obviously it isn't in Lion 10.7.4). This created the 2 files you would expect on the destination: and it's resource fork . However, it also created another file which seems essential. It is displayed as in the Mac Terminal, but got a weird name on the Samba share, probably to work around the illegal trailing dot. (on my machine, Samba replaced the trailing dot with the UTF8 "private" character xEFx80xA9) Update: Even when copying from Preview, it does not always work with NFS. It does sometimes!?!... Copying the files from a FAT32 drive (which also has the extra file) to the NFS share doesn't work. What does seem to work reliably is terribly convoluted, but anyway, here it goes: 

If they are different speeds, you will be limited to the speed of the slowest one (or they may not work at all together). Other than that, I don't think so. (and even if you do run the new memory at a lower speed, you probably won't notice the difference) 

I'm writing a paper on how to use search engines (directed towards people who weren't raised by Google) and I'm having troubling thinking of examples of bad searches (that people actually do). The examples I have so far are when people do searches like "how do I fix my laptop" instead of "dv2125nr won't turn on" or "why doesn't windows work" instead of "windows error IRQ NOT LESS OR EQUAL". Any ideas? 

Since no one has mentioned it yet: Package managers. On Windows, you find your software by searching around online, then every time they're updated, you run the installer again (and get asked about all of the configuration all over again). Example: Installing Firefox 

I'm just wondering what the limits for are. I have a program that always takes exactly 20 ms, so I assume this is the lowest it can measure, but I want to see if there's some sort of documentation of this. 

However, the interaction between the "Perfomance Options" / "Visual Effects" window and the registry is quite mysterious and I never found a decent reference about it. 

(The option makes a backup and converts the file in-place instead of to stdout) At least for filters and include/exclude options, it would be really nice to have a case-insensitive flag in rsync. Until then, the only options seem to be either the patch or the convoluted regex-like syntax. 

The title is misleading, since the author doesn't really want a full diff. He only wants to know IF 2 files are different. The distinction is important if the files are big. Checksumming methods will obviously read both files entirely. As far as I could tell, Windows' and both also read the entire files, even if there was a difference in the first bytes. As John T suggests, get GNU diffutils, which includes . With big files, will be a lot faster than COMP or FC. That is if you need it to be a command-line tool. If you can use a GUI shareware, Total Commander has a "Compare Files" command, and a "Synchronize dirs" command which can be set to compare files by content. Both are extremely fast. 

When you read a page from a disk, your operating system will load that data into memory, and leave it there until it has a better use for that memory. If you have sufficient memory, your OS will only read each page once, and then use it from memory from then on. The only reason the OS will do real disk IO is if it needs to read a page that's not already in memory, or if a page is written to (in which case, you presumably want it saved to the disk). One advantage of doing things this way is that you don't have to load the entire hard drive into memory, which is useful if it won't fit, and also means you don't waste time reading files that your applications don't need. Another advantage is that the cache can be discarded whenever the OS needs more memory (it's better to have your next disk read be slightly slower, than to have your programs crash because they're out of memory). Also, it's useful that users don't need to manually decide what should be in the ramdisk or not: Whatever you use most often will automatically be kept in main memory. If you have a lot of memory, but your applications aren't running as fast as you would expect, there's a good chance they're slower because they're running safely. For example, SQLite is orders of magnitude faster if you tell it not to wait for writes to complete, but your database will be completely broken if you don't shutdown cleanly. Also, is usually a ramdisk on Linux distros, because it's ok if that data gets lost. There's still some debate over whether that's a good idea though, because if too much data gets written to , you can run out of memory. 

Many players support ASS tags in .srt files. Below is an example using ASS positioning tags which work in both VLC and SMplayer in Linux, and probably in many other players and other OSes. Note that the accepted answer suggests an older version of the SSA format, using instead of . The numbers used in the older format are also different, and that format is considered deprecated. The newer format uses the numpad layout for the numbers. While SMplayer correctly displays both formats, VLC only accepts the current format. 

go to Account Settings -> Synchronization & Storage and uncheck "Keep messages for this account on the computer". under Account Settings -> Server Settings, take note of the relevant "Local directory". exit Thunderbird in that "Local directory" and it's subfolders, delete the mailbox files (the files which have no extension). But keep the .msf index files and the .sdb files. 

If you need netcat, you can whitelist netcat.exe in your anti-virus program. You may also want to download a current version, which is called ncat and can be found in the nmap distribution. 

Blocklists generally block IP addresses belonging to companies that try to either track bittorrent users or send them bad data. From what I've heard, they're useful as protection against tracking (and getting infringment letters), but the main reason to use a blocklist is that they generally speed up your downloads. The reason is that some companies run bittorrent clients with intentionally bad data and try to share it. Your client will automatically discard it, but it will slow you down. Your client will also eventually block them even without the blocklist, but it's faster to just block them from the start. EDIT: So here's an article about how blocklists are helpful as protection against tracking (TorrentFreak suggests that if you're not using a blocklist, you're being tracked). 

.app "files" are folders containing multiple files. What you're seeing are the files distributed with the program, not the source code. The best analogy I can think of is if Windows programs were distributed in .zip files and you just dropped them in C:\Program Files to install them instead of extracting them. (So the files you're seeing are the files you would see in that program's "Program Files\program name" folder on Windows) 

I do that so I can use a comfortable file manager (MC) and my usual shell configuration instead of what I would get in the NAS shell. 

If you want to automate the conversion of filter files to this syntax, you can use this perl command: 

You can enable writing to HFS+ in Linux even if you didn't disable journaling. In addition to hfsplus which you already have, you need to have hfsprogs installed: 

For IMAP accounts, offline folders are enabled by default, so a copy of all mail is kept locally. To disable it: 

There seem to be many different causes for high CPU use on the host. In my case, with a Win7 guest, the solution was to disable the "VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension". Either in Settings -> Display -> Remote Display: unselect "Enable Server". Or by starting the machine with the option. 

Yes. I'm currently trying to investigate such a problem. However, I don't know if there is a difference between drag/drop and copy/paste. Apparently, there are differences between different copy programs. I experienced corrupted copies with drag/drop in Windows Explorer, but not with another file manager (Total Commander). Have yet to test copy, xcopy and others. My problem is hardware related, but yes, Windows can, in some particular circumstances create non-identical copies, without realizing it and without showing an error. I would have thought that any copy program would eventually end up using the same Windows internal copy routine, but apparently not. Still, it would be surprising if the same program (Windows Explorer) used 2 different copy routines depending on how the copy was initiated. 

Your outer has 4 arguments, but the inner one has 3. The documentation suggests that 3 is the correct number. Does this work? 

Install CD: These are not capable of running an OS, only installing it. Live CD: You can run an OS from these, or install the OS (generally) 

I'm trying to figure out how to make a package of mine depend on anything that provides "java", but I'm not sure what to even look up. Apparently "yum provides" is a command for finding out which package contains a particular file, and "yum info" doesn't seem to have the information I want. Basically, my OS has a package called "java-1.6.0-openjdk", and my package requires some implementaiton of Java, but it would work perfectly fine on Oracle Java, or Java 7, so I won't want to be that specific about it. Is there a way to just depend on anything that provides Java? 

What do we mean by ISO image of a Operating system? (If we're only concerned with their uses for operating systems,) an ISO image is a binary file representing the entire filesystem of one of the following:
