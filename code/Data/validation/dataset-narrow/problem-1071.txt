Despite what the official source says, the third stage may happen sooner than expected: as the commenter KY noted, the anti-malware service will stop as early as June 15, 2015. Whether intentional or not, this was confirmed by my tests as well.

Technical specifications The Sony VAIO VPCEB24EN comes with a ATI Mobility Radeon 5145 graphic card with 512 MB of dedicated RAM. You can confirm that by using a program such as GPU-Z. Here's an excerpt from the official specifications: 

If you opt in, Windows collects statistical information about your system. A summary of the aggregated data is periodically uploaded to Microsoft servers. 

Detach a disk image file To detach an image file the syntax is similar: you just need to replace the file path with . The parameter can be omitted:

It then scan all favorite links available in the target folder, getting the URL of each. Finally the IE start page(s) are set. As soon as the browser is started, the selected pages will load automatically. Along with the scheduled task below, this make things work in a set-and-forget fashion. Scheduled task 

Manual policy tweaking Searching for on the web returned few, yet interesting results. In particular a post on a Japanese board and a reply on a Russian forum. By translating and putting together the bits of information, I was able to get a clearer picture - literally.

Unless you updated the BIOS yourself, you should leave it as-is. Otherwise you might consider downgrading to version , which is the previous non-beta release. Also, make sure you're using latest Dropbox version. 

File sharing encryption By default, Windows 7 uses 128-bit encryption for file sharing connections. The GUI allows you to choose 40- or 56-bit encryption as well:

Patching the limitation The library file can be patched in order to fool the viewer into thinking the operating system wasn't started in safe mode. Despite what the warning message says, all features except printing appear to be working fine. Note While the patch might have some side effects, it doesn't seem the case according to my tests. 

Whether the link target or the actual shortcut file is loaded depends on the program, though. Here's a list (in no particular order) of some free hex editors which supports them out of the box: 

Location list This is the merged list of all 32-bit and 64-bit locations used by Autoruns (as of version 12.03) running on Windows XP and later: Registry

Test B1 While shrinking the cache to 32 MiB, five image samples are loaded. Their size range from 16 MiB to 1 MiB halving each time, minus 0.5% to account rounding errors. For example, to search a 15.92 MiB image I used the following search query: 

Note When editing files, any changes to the structure will change the the torrent hash. This means you won't be able to download or upload files from/to peers having the original torrent.

Press Enter to confirm the operation, then specify a drive label, or just press Enter again to leave it empty. 

A practical example Let's say you have a computer with 32 GiB of RAM, and you install Windows 7 Home Premium x64 (64-bit). In that case you would be limited to 16 GiB. If you were to use Windows Anytime Upgrade, and upgrade to a more expensive edition, suddenly the limit would be set to 192 GiB instead. Conclusion All Windows 7 editions share the same source code. The main difference is the number of features/limitations which are either enabled or disabled. Professional and higher client editions have no upper limit to how much RAM they can handle, and are just licensed to what Microsoft guarantees to support. Additionally, the Windows 7 EULA explicitly says that you may not "use the software for commercial software hosting services", hinting Microsoft assumed that if you need more RAM that what the highest client edition is licensed to, then what you really want is a server license. Windows 7's server counterpart (that is, Windows Server 2008 R2) can use up to 2 TiB of RAM in the Enterprise and Datacenter editions. As technology moves fast, what was acceptable yesterday might not be enough tomorrow. In order to catch up, Windows 8 raised the limits to 128 GiB and 512 GiB for the Core and Pro/Enterprise editions, respectively. That only applies to 64-bit versions, though: 32-bit versions are still capped at 4 GiB. The server version, Windows Server 2012, can address up to 4 TiB of RAM in the higher editions. Further reading
