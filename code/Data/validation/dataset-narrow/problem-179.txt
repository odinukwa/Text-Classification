The short answer is because ZEUS (which is summarizing) is summarizing for Area 2, but it also shares Area 2 with WODAN. OSPF requires all routers in an area to have the same exact copy of the area's link-state database; OSPF ABRs run a separate SPF algorithm calculation for each area they participate in. Quoting RFC 2328 - Open Shortest Path First: 

For example, the display filter to find a Network Summary LSA (LSA Type 3) with the ID of 10.4.27.0 (hex 0a.04.1b.00): 

If you want a generalized solution to this problem (without dependencies the topology or type of OSPF network involved), you are making one of the classic cases for MPLS TE; OSPF supports MPLS TE (see RFC 3630). Let's assume: 

Catalyst6500 LAN Card IP subinterfaces Because Catalyst6500 Vlans have a global scope throughout the chassis, LAN cards on Sup720 support a routed dot1q subinterface, as long as you have not used that same vlan elsewhere... example: 

Please find the configuration to print the last configured interface below... I need to give credit to Ivan Pepelnjak for his blog about 

In the event that both speakers open duplicate TCP sessions and send OPEN messages on each socket simultaneously, the BGP Identifier is used to resolve which socket should be closed. See RFC 4271, Section 6.8: 

Example 2 (using ): However, if I configure this on the c1841's aux port, reverse-telnet and reverse-ssh work... 

Question I can see the GeoIP data points in the file; however, when I open the file in my browser, it was blank. How can I get wireshark to correctly display the GeoIP map? 

I talked with a Cisco Wireless Consulting SE... The first problem is that the recovery image (i.e. image) does not have the firmware for Dot11 radios... so I had to upload new firmware. I normally use to upgrade the image when I am dealing with older Cisco AP 1242 models; however, under this image I kept getting an error until I used ... 

Cisco IOS with CEF Load-balancing, hashed on L4 ports... In IOS 12.4, Cisco introduced another algorithm to load-balance traffic based on L4 ports... use at the global configuration level. Load-balancing with MPLS TE MPLS TE introduces yet another twist into load-balancing, including the potential for offline optimization of paths; typically you buy an application to perform offline load optimization among various MPLS TE tunnels in the network. This too, is a very deep subject... I mention it only because you're asking about load-balancing with MPLS "automatically". 

Ethernet payload efficiency at 9000-byte MTUs The efficiency at 9000 bytes (assuming no Vlan tag) is: 99.14% 

The simple answer is to make the CAM timer equal or slightly longer than the corresponding interface ARP timer, but there are at least three different options to select from... Option 1: Lower all interface ARP Timers This option works best if you have a decent-sized layer2 switched network, a reasonable number of ARP entries and few routed interfaces. This method also is preferable if you like to see PC mac entries age out of the topology quickly. 

is one of the Catalyst 6500's hidden vlans. The 6500 allocates internal vlans for a lot of different functions, and those vlans cant be used for real user data after the 6500 snarfs it. If you want to see the internal vlans, use ... my particular 6500 doesn't run netflow export, but you can see it on your switch with that command. 

Assuming a Cisco WLC... Go to "WLAN > Select the WLAN Profile > General Tab > Radio Policy" Updating my answer to clarify a few things... 

Merely putting personal-use internet on a different subnet is normally not sufficient unless that subnet is firewalled from the rest of the company; there are all kinds of internet vulnerabilities that hijack a users' PC and pose a threat to your company unless you are smart about protecting yourself. This is one example of a innocent-looking Wordpress compromise (CVE-2013-1949) that would be a threat to an unprotected internal network. Personal-use Internet for BYOD is not a security risk if done correctly... 

NOTE: I am assuming you're already familiar with loading MIBs on a Windows / Linux machine, and using / ... if not, please let me know I recently discovered how well you can manage Cisco's LWAPs through the AIRESPACE-WIRELESS-MIB, in fact I have mostly forsaken our WCS in favor of managing our LWAPs with the MIB (we have a couple hundred LWAPs spread across multiple WLCs at our facility). Since you know Perl, you could write a loop to poll your WLCs for the new LWAPs; then the script reacts accordingly when it sees a new LWAP mac-address on a WLC. 

A final side note that you didn't explicitly mention... you configured ZEUS' Loopbacks with 24-bit masks; however, due to the way OSPF handles loopbacks, those loopbacks are advertised as host routes. 

End Note You asked about "the block or a subnet"; however, ARIN deals with allocations of individual IP addresses, not subnets or blocks of addresses. 

No authentication is primarily the reason I do it; it is less typing and a very easy way to transfer images. You certainly can use scp or ftp. There is no reason to bother with that... so what if someone sniffs my IOS image? 

Since you're building an ASA subinterface (with an IP address), it is more work to add a Layer3 SVI on the 3550. If you have a subinterface on the ASA and an SVI on the 3550, then you need static / dynamic routing between the ASA and 3550. If you do not add an SVI on the 3550, you need no special routing between them. Trunk all your 3550 vlans as dot1q through (Fa0/1 below) to the ASA interface (Gi0/0 below), and default your users through that ASA's IP address on the appropriate vlan. 

You are going to make host1 and host2 work very hard to untangle your intentional packet duplication scheme for no good reason You are burning horsepower on your ipsec encryption points for no good reason TCP has been refined for over three decades to automatically recover from infrastructure flaws and failures; "helping" TCP in such a way fixes the wrong problem. You need to make your infrastructure react to mitigate problems, you should not duct-tape TCP to survive problematic infrastructure. 

Example: Consider this router that has a WAN HDLC link on Serial1/0, and a LAN connection via FastEthernet0/0... 

This is not a perfect solution, but use the WLC to push an ACL to the AP's wireless radio interfaces; the ACL should block all traffic sourced from port udp/67. You don't want to do this with an autonomous access point's BVI interface for all the obvious reasons. 

Now I did a second just to be sure, and loaded 3.4.1SG again to check which VRFs came up by default in 3.4.1SG. As one might suspect, some crazy person at Cisco renamed the management interfaces between IOS releases (probably because they were scolded for using a non-standard oob vrf name, since every other Cisco I can think of uses ). 

The whole point of this distinction between Transit Network and Stub Network is to save resources in the router. 

Once you've done this, you just need to update the router's version of periodically to ensure you catch everything. Whether it's really useful to accept someone else's definition of German AS numbers is another interesting question, but I'll assume you're happy with he.net's list. 

Quoting the Nexus Storm Control Docs (emphasis mine): "You can use the traffic storm control feature to prevent disruptions on Layer 2 ports by a broadcast, multicast, or unknown unicast traffic storm on physical interfaces. " Storm control operates the same way across Cisco platforms; if the destination-mac-address is not in the CAM table, then then the switch must flood it out all ports in the Vlan (except the one it came in on). Suffient quantities of this kind of traffic would trigger your Unicast Storm Control thresholds. 

The MIB below (from an older version of the 3GPP spec) includes 3GPP 24.080 Mobile Terminating Location Request (MT-LR) and Mobile Originated Location Request (MO-LR) MIB objects; since SNMP uses ASN.1 syntax, I believe this answers your question. This was the best non-PDF copy of the MIB that I could find... 

Answering the original router question: Arp caches are there to map an IP addess to a mac address. There's nothing unique about a router. .. it needs an ARP cache just like any other IP device. Managed switches likewise need an Arp cache so they can communicate with the stations managing them. As we discussed in chat, you need to add an IP address to your switch so you can communicate via ARP. 

Question What CLI do I need to use to successfully upgrade ISE 1.1? A directory listing for and show version follows... 

I can't find a similar public statement from ARIN, but I know someone personally who received a reassigned ASN from ARIN. 

Details: Strictly speaking, no an IGMPv2 or IGMPv3 listener cannot specify a port to listen for. Let's assume you have the following situation: 

Adding to the other answers... the thing you lack now is an access-list to limit NAT to your inside addresses... if you apply this configuration, I think this should get you going as long as there aren't other subnets routed by this router. 

Background I recently upgraded a pair of Catalyst4500s from Sup6E to Sup7E. Before the upgrade, I pre-loaded IOS-XE 3.4.1SG on the Sup7Es, and loaded the migration configurations into on the new sups. We needed to perform the upgrade as quickly as possible; and I had only a few hours between the time I cut the tape on the shipping boxes and putting the new Sup7Es into production. After pulling the old Sup6s out, I started maintenance with one Sup7E in each chassis running 3.4.1SG (which I had pre-loaded); the other two Sup7Es were left on 3.2.2SG to conserve time while I prepared for maintenance. I manually copied 3.4.1SG to and reloaded when I inserted the standby supervisors. FWIW, copying IOS to is much faster than copying with tftp on these Sup7Es. Maintenance window results I had a strange result by the end of the maintenance window: 

Make sure the third switch is disconnected. Configure on all switches. Configure on the switch closest to your Internet / WAN connection Configure on the other (running) switch Configure on all ports connecting to the other switches. 

Next-hop reachability is one of the most basic issues when understanding BGP; almost everyone runs into this issue when they're experimenting with the protocol. 

System limits I don't know what kind of disk you have, but often the single-system limit is disk I/O... there are several points of interest here... from the controller's perspective... 

2886938622 - 2886936577 + 1 = 2046 hosts Note that I added an extra host in the subtraction, since you're including the first host in the list of available hosts. As someone mentioned below you can also use the host bits of the netmask, if you're merely calculating the number of hosts in an IP CIDR block. How to convert an IPv4 addess to decimal: 172*256**3 + 19*256**2 + 40*256**1 + 1*256**0 = 2886936577 

Later in the RFC, it requires routers not to send a "Network Unreachable" instead of Type 3 Codes 1 or 7 when other hosts on the subnet are reachable... 

That's obviously the wrong solution, but it's a dead-simple test to illustrate why things are broken (keep in mind that you may need to wait a bit for the BGP next-hop scanner to run before 192.168.1.0/24's route is installed). There are two possible solutions that come to mind, but only one really makes sense in most networks... 

How Ethernet switches control Collision Domains Ethernet switches control collision domains because they can join half-duplex and full-duplex links within the same broadcast domain; Ethernet switches buffer frames to assist the transition between half-duplex and full-duplex links. Example: This shows a strange network which illustrates how collision domains are a contained within a broadcast domain, and how devices form boundaries for each one. 

The meanings are very different for each term; even more confusing is the reality that you can potentially apply multiple stub terms to a single OSPF interface. I'll elaborate more below. Background Let's clear up some terminology... The question starts off asking about what Cisco is calling a "Stub Host"... OSPF automatically assigns Loopback interfaces to this category... 

No, it just means that BGP hasn't restarted yet. Quoting from RFC 4724 Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP, pg 5: 

You didn't specify a router vendor or network protocol, but let's assume it's a Cisco and IP (for the moment). Example of forwarding IP broadcasts from 10.0.1.0/24 to 192.0.2.0/24 Assume IPv4 broadcast traffic enters the router like this: 

Depends on the company... I have seen it used for stuff like firewall bypass links (i.e. if they have to take the firewall out of service, they bypass the FW with a higher delay links "just in case"). It's most commonly used for a dedicated backup path. 

Why does the BGP Origin code matter? So the question might be asked, "who cares what the BGP Origin code is?"; the Origin code matters in certain cases. If you look at the BGP Path Selection algorithm, origin code is considered at step 6 of the 10-step algorithm; is considered the lowest if the weight, local-preference, and AS-path length are all the same. BGP admins typically set on all ingress prefixes to avoid routes with . If you have routes with , it potentially short-cuts these decision points: lowest MED, EBGP vs IBGP, lowest IGP cost to the BGP next-hop, and lowest BGP router-id. So the short answer is people manually force so bgp behaves more rationally. For instance, setting all routes to helps facilitate Hot Potato Routing BGP Path Selection Algorithm: Just for grins, I'm including the BGP path selection algorithm below... notice that the Origin code is at step 6, but there are very relevant decision points below. 

When a rollback occurs, the configuration is locked from any other config activity. In case of a bug, or some unpredictable event it's a good idea to have in your config when using this feature. I like the max timeout value of 600 seconds... this means the maximum time the configuration can be locked is 10 minutes. Historical note Originally, Juniper was the first major vendor to deploy config rollback features. I worked for Cisco at the time, and our sales accounts were screaming for this feature in Cisco IOS. I still remember internal edicts from significant players in the company, who said "it's impossible in Cisco IOS". Of course, with enough persistence (and a couple of years in the middle) we have it in IOS... the point is, don't assume the first "no, we can't do that" really is correct.
