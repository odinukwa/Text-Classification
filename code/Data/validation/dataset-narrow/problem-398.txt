No. The query optimizer should see through this. There's no general rule that subqueries are materialized in query execution. 

You can restore a SQL 7 backup on a SQL 2005 instance, then backup/restore or detach/attach to SQL 2012 or 2014. "version 10" is SQL 2008, so you wouldn't want to stop there, probably. You can get old installs of SQL from MSDN Subscriber Downloads, or the Express Edition is still available for download. 

For "management and scalability" Azure SQL Database is clearly better. Azure SQL Database was designed for this scenario. You can spread out your databases across multiple pools, as needed, or move specific databases to non-pooled DTUs. And Azure SQL Database has built-in patching, HA/DR, monitoring, and backup. Azure Virtual Machines give you way more flexibility to design SQL Servers that exactly fit your needs, but that comes with a cost of complexity and management. In both cases you should plan to spread your databases out over a few Elastic Pools / VMs, so you can scale out as well as up. 

Keep track of the row count in a variable, and return that to the client with an output parameter or a result set. 

The CPU_USED row should be accurate. And so your workload is only managing to use 7sec of CPU time per second. This is like only running on 7 cores. In the mean time you have 1000sec of page latch time, meaning that you have, on average 1000 sessions waiting to latch a page, and only 7 performing useful work. You are also running very old software on a very large server. The throughput on this server is pretty high, suggesting that the operation it supports is important. Also consider your username. So you should consider, strongly, engaging Microsoft Support or a partner with expertise in this sort of thing. That said, the next step is to identify the source of your latch waits. Generally these are either on a hot page of a table in your database, or a system page in TempDb. The sys.dm_exec_requests.wait_resource should tell you which. If tempdb, then Recommendations to reduce allocation contention in SQL Server tempdb. If a table in your database, then post the DDL (including indexes) for the table and a the details of the queries that are blocking. There is a whitepaper on diagnosing and resolving latch contention on SQL 2008 here: Diagnosing and Resolving Latch Contention on SQL Server 

SQL Server has had column encryption with server-managed keys since SQL 2005. See Encrypt a Column of Data. AlwaysEncrypted uses client-side keys. 

Probably. One key strategy to deadlock resolution is to lock earlier and bigger. Deadlocks occur only when two sessions acquire compatible locks, and then later attempt to acquire incompatible locks. If the first locks in the transaction are incompatible, then the second session will wait until the first commits to acquire its first lock. One easy way to get a lock at the right granularity is to use an application lock, with sp_getapplock. If you decide that transaction A and B can't run concurrently, then just make each acquire the same application lock at the beginning, and they will run sequentially. 

Either use the SSMS Copy Database Wizard Or use the SSMS Backup Database UI to backup and restore to the instance's default backup location. 

IMO this problem lacks sufficient generality to build standards or reusable solutions. It's really just a problem you solve with data modeling, Something along the lines of: 

Here's the canonical design for a Many-to-Many linking table. You generally want an index to support traversal in each direction, and (at least for SQL Server) it doesn't matter whether you use a unique constraint, unique index or non-unique non-clustered index for the reverse key index: you end up with the same data structure. 

Transactional Replication uses the TDS protocol and applies changes using SQL. The connections are established from the Distributor for Push Subscriptions, and from the Subscriber for Pull Subscriptions. AlwaysOn Availability groups use TCP/IP connection between the replicas using the Database Mirroring Endpoint. The connections are established from the instances hosting the Secondary replicas to the instance hosting the Primary replica. But as the Primary replica can move, every server hosting a replica needs to be able to connect to every other one. 

You can back up and restore SSAS Tabular 2012 databases, but you will have to adjust the security role memberships to include users in the correct domain. You can perform the backup and restore manually or through a script in Management Studio (or executed via PowerShell). You can also re-deploy an SSAS database from the SSDT project or using the SSAS Deployment wizard. The wizard will allow you to deploy roles and ignore members. Next populate the role memberships with appropriate users. From there, you can process the model to populate it and bring the model online. Another option is to script the SSAS database from Management Studio. Once you do this you can remove the collection from each role and execute the XMLA on your target server. 

Date dimensions are pretty standard in a data warehouse, and are highly recommended by Kimball as most facts tie to a date. Typically, the key is an integer. It can be a meaningless surrogate key, or it can be a "smart" key where the integer is in the form yyyymmdd; e.g., the key for August 2, 2014 would be 20140802. Date dimensions provide a set of contiguous dates in multiple formats and allow you to do date calculations once rather than in each query. They make it very easy to do time period comparisons. You can add other fields that could be analytically relevant such as holidays, indicators of work days, fiscal calendars (where different from standard calendar years). There are lots of scripts available online to create and populate a date dimension. Many tools will create the date dimension for you. I'm not sure what you are using for your underlying data source, so here are a couple of examples of date dimensions. Hopefully you can convert these to the appropriate format for your needs. 

You cannot use an aggregate like CountRows() in a calculated field in your dataset. But you can use CountRows() as an expression in a textbox (alone or within a table) scoped to your dataset. Now that you have your dataset created, you can put a textbox on the report and populate it with the expression , and it will provide the correct answer. Otherwise, you will need to modify your dataset to include the rowcount. It would seem that using the expression in the report would be the desired option as modiying the dataset would give you a column populated with either a running total or the total rows repeated on each column. 

You can put your cube formula in a separate cell and reference the cell where users type in the name they want. For example, if you have users put the branch name in cell B2, you can put this formula in another cell. 

Since I can't see your table structure and I don't know the size of your data, here's something that will return the right answer but may or may not need to be tweaked for performance. You can write a query that groups both created and closed tickets together by date. Although you could just write two queries and do a full outer join, I would guess you want SSRS to accurately represent days with no ticket activity in addition to filtering the data for the date range at the source instead of in the presentation layer, so I would suggest creating a date table/CTE/query. If you already have a date table, use it. If not, here is a way to create what you need for the last 30 days. You could also make it a stored procedure and parameterize it to choose the number of days. 

If you are browsing in Excel and want to be able to see dimension attribute members that do not have corresponding rows in a fact table (measure returns nothing), there is a pivot table setting you can use. Access the PivotTable Options dialog box by right clicking on the pivot table and choosing PivotTable Options. On the Display tab, check the box next to Show items with no data on rows. This will show all values of whatever hierarchy is in your rows regardless of if the measure in the Values section of your pivot table returns a non-blank result. You can do the same thing for columns by checking the item underneath the one indicated in the image. This option must be set for each pivot table and will apply to all fields in the rows (or columns) when you check the box. 

Verify here you have had only a single control file and not two or three of them. If you have had more than one control file, then this instruction is not for you. 

Don't use bare because without SET UNTIL it doesn't work as you'd expect in some scenarios. I wouldn't say any of these two solutions are inherently safe, both have as many pitfalls as any other Oracle's advanced features, so you need to do some research upfront. 

XE does not support Streams, as officially documented. SE and SE1 support Streams but without redo capture. EE and PE (Personal Edition) fully support Streams, and also support Logical Standby. 

Because for some strange reason, although regexp_like looks like a function on a first glance, it is not a function in reality, but is a condition (an integral part of SQL syntax). But, more confusingly, it is a function if used in PL/SQL: 

Beware the OS authentication is done by client machine, not by the database server. I think that within reasonable pessimism to Oracle tools you could expect that it boils down to this: database server receives a TCP connection from whichever IP address that might pass the network path, and that connection just claims "I promise I've done OS authentication and, trust me, this connection is made on behalf of OPS$JohnSmithCEO." Neither the database client or database server is given OS password for additional OS authentication! And you can't even trust that this connection came from a valid Oracle software. It can be man-in-the-middle in reality. It's worse than telnet. Whatever "Windows-specific" checks are done by Oracle, they seem contrived and you can't really trust they are complete and secure. 

This is a full database import which also includes tablespace definitions. Find out from the original Solaris database what are all the target tablespace names and sizes. Pre-create the tablespaces manually using the datafile paths of your choice () before performing the import. You will see which you can ignore. 

The next thing in terms of cost is an OS (machine) and its IP address. You cannot afford a separate system for every TNS name. So crmdb.mydomain.local is not the only name for the IP address; the same IP address would have more names, like financedb.mydomain.local. Your OS admin would decide how to do this best, and how to determine the main hostname of the OS. They have the same problem with many other systems - multiple names referring to one OS - so they should have a solution at hand. The only people who are confused now are DBAs and OS admins, they see multiple hostnames leading to the same IP address. But users don't care about that and are not confused by that. (By the way this approach is coherent with SCAN. ) The next thing in terms of cost is either one of the two: an Oracle instance or "administrative cost of separating schemas out of instance". The tradeoff is for you to decide. 

The green bug you're seeing (look closely) means the package have been compiled with DEBUG option. It is also seen on bare procedures and functions. It is a coincidence they don't expand - maybe a bug (duh) in SQLdeveloper :) On mine, these expand without problem. 

In Oracle starts a PL/SQL block. In other words, after you ought to provide a text of a program that is written in a procedural language that is somewhat different than SQL (although it bears some similarities). Your sqlplus had read everything but it was not yet parsing or executing anything, it was waiting for an and a line containing only a slash like this: 

You don't want your test database to retain the same internal id number as the production database. Hence it would be best to use RMAN's command DUPLICATE, because it sets a different id (and also a new database name). This command is specifically designed to do what you require.
