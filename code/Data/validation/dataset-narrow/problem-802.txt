These options having been swiped out of the generated grub configuration. Now tell systemd to do its magic. 

You're trying to install from the installation DVD, which due to space constraints doesn't contain every possible package. To install packages that aren't on the DVD during installation, you'll need to do a network installation instead, generally from a local mirror accessible via NFS or HTTP, or a public mirror. 

Congratulations on having a popular web site and managing to keep it running on a virtual machine for all this time. If you're really pulling in two million pageviews per day, then you're going to stack up a LOT of PHP sessions in the filesystem, and they're going to take a long time to delete no matter whether you use or or a vacuum cleaner. At this point I'd recommend you look into alternate ways to store your sessions: 

This network card is ancient and the sundance driver is no longer supported in EL7. The drivers given by the network card vendor are for a much older version of the kernel and are unlikely to work on modern systems. Just go get a $10 gigabit NIC, before you have spent much more than $10 in labor costs trying to make this work. 

If you're running email on the server, then the hostname should be set to one in a domain that you control, rather than one controlled by your service provider. You do not need to place it in , provided that the appropriate DNS entries exist for the name. 

At a minimum, you need to define , or in to specify the host to send SNMP traps to. You can also specify the community string and an alternate port number (if not using 162). You can also set a for a default community string to be used when sending traps. For sending v3 traps, use . See the man page for full details. See also the net-snmp snmptrap tutorial and snmptrap v3 tutorial. 

At this point you should be able to continue with the Fedora instructions. Keep in mind in the future: Fedora only keeps two release versions active at any given time. After that, the old distros may be removed from mirrors, making it impossible to update in this manner. So you should stay at most one version behind. Alternately, consider using a more stable distribution such as CentOS so that you mostly avoid this mess entirely. 

(Note that I've completely removed from this, as there's little good reason to be running this within a screen.) 

Whatever service you configured to run on port 10024 is not running. Inspect your to find out what service it is, if you don't already know, and then start the service. 

This file is part of the firmware package distributed with the Linux kernel. Due to licensing issues, Debian does not install it by default. If you need it, you must explicitly install it. 

Unset PHP's directive in . This will cause it to log to standard error, which nginx will then log to its own error log. Set in your php-fpm configuration , to ensure that the FPM SAPI doesn't discard standard error. 

The directive does not match on the query string. So you'll have to do something else. I presume you have a large number of these to work with, so I would suggest using a couple of s. For instance: 

Not much really changes when you switch to a DVCS. The big difference is that the copy of the source code on every developer's workstation is now its own repository as well. I doubt there's much reason for IT to worry about this. Just because git and mercurial are distributed, doesn't mean you will be deploying/delivering directly from some developer's desktop. It's still possible - and almost certainly necessary - to continue using some central repos that everyone checks into, for testing, QA and eventual release. Whether IT is monitoring source code on developer workstations or not, nothing really changes. You're still going to get the change history into the central repos as soon as they're pushed, which is what I suspect they're really concerned about. What you gain from this from an IT standpoint is that you aren't hitting the central repos every few minutes (or seconds!) whenever the developers make a commit. Developers can finish working on something and then push it up only when it's ready, but still have complete version control on their workstation without having to hit the network nearly so much. Finally, you need to have a more detailed chat with IT regarding the exact nature of the compliance issues they're talking about. This could be anything from managing intellectual property, ISO 9000, or some government laws/regulations. (To all: feel free to improve this answer; this is not my area of expertise...) 

You don't need to download and install RSAT for this. Hyper-V Manager, while technically an "RSAT technology", is shipped with Windows 8/8.1, rather than with the RSAT package. According to Microsoft: 

is set too low. This controls how many PHP processes will be spawned to handle simultaneous incoming requests. If more requests come in than children are available, the new connections have to wait... eventually they will wait forever. Raise this value; find it in . This is the actual cause of your immediate problem, though you have some more insidious problems which you probably haven't noticed yet... means PHP is crashing while servicing requests. Depending on when in the processing it crashed, this may have no visible impact, or may result in blank pages, aborted transfers, users being mysteriously logged out, etc. Consider updating PHP to the latest point release (5.3.x or 5.4.x) and removing or replacing known problematic extensions such as APC. 

Rich rules aren't the way to go about this. They'll just create confusion, now and later. Understand that a firewalld zone corresponds to a set of services that you may wish to allow, and the sources of the traffic to those services. All you have to do is to set the services you want to allow in the zone (which you probably already have done) and then set the sources. Traffic sources can be designated in two ways: By interface, or by source IP address. Traffic that matches any source passes this check. So, what you want to do is to add the IP addresses allowed to reach the services, and then remove the interface (if any). 

Generally your OpenVZ provider only needs to enable the FUSE device for your container. This is handled more-or-less the same way enabling TUN/TAP support is. Just open a ticket to the provider to have them enable it. Or if you want things to work out of the box, skip OpenVZ (how do I hate thee, let me count the ways) and use Xen or KVM. 

You're running an old OS on new hardware. Since you have an old release of RHEL, you have an old version of the PCI ID database which is used to look up device IDs and give textual descriptions for them. And since it's old, it can't possibly have descriptions for hardware that didn't exist when it was created (since time travel does not yet exist). This is not really an issue you need to worry about if you are updating to 6.4. It will have the latest PCI IDs and kernel drivers for any significant piece of hardware in that system. Anything that it might not have, such as HP management agents, you can obtain from HP. 

Someone more experienced may have better ideas, but this definitely makes me think you have an issue with your cabling, or a noisy line, or the telco clock is completely wrong. It's probably time for that conference call. 

Sorry, no. All logged messages are viewable with in the order in which they were received, subject to the size of its ring buffer. If you need to view recent log entries, without seeing firewall logs, use the actual logs where the entries are being stored. 

Yes. It's a MAK, so you're supposed to use the same product key, up to the number of allowed activations. See Microsoft's Volume Licensing FAQ for the full details. 

(and for that matter ) are not the same domain as , hence the warning. You should have certificates for those domains as well, if you need to avoid this warning. 

www.ureka.org doesn't have an address record in the DNS, so nobody can find it. To resolve the problem, add the appropriate AAAA and A records for your IPv6 and IPv4 addresses. 

virt-manager creates raw disk images by default. These are the most portable, since any hypervisor known to man can deal with them. If you create one as a file on disk, it will have the .img extension. If you want to choose a different format, then when adding storage, choose "Select managed or other existing storage", then click Browse. On the next screen select a storage pool, click New Volume, and you can create a volume in any of a variety of formats. 

The Red Hat documentation explicitly instructs you to use the fully qualified domain name as the machine's static hostname. Trying to name a server with a single unqualified name causes a variety of problems with various services, most notably email. 

SELinux is denying you access to the file, since you moved instead of copied it from somewhere else on the filesystem into its final location. Thus it kept its original security context, which didn't allow Apache to access it. To resolve the issue, relabel the file with . To avoid the problem in future, copy files (and delete the original if necessary). 

Remi has httpd 2.4.2 in his github repo, though he doesn't seem to have built it yet (or it doesn't yet work) as I don't see RPMs for it yet. But you may be able to take his stuff and build RPMs. 

You're on the right track with . But you want to append the complete URL path, not the query string as you had been doing. For instance: 

You can try using the Windows Update PowerShell Module to manage Windows updates on your server. But what you really need to do is to set up the servers to pull updates from WSUS. 

You're using rvm, so the proper way to deal with ruby not being found is to use an rvm wrapper (on SysVinit and upstart systems). First (optional) create an alias for your app to the gemset you want to use: 

Funny, I just happened to reboot a CentOS 7 system last night, and so I have a nice log of just this to look at. In the case of a crash, obviously nothing is logged between the time of the crash and the system restart. In the case of a reboot, it is pretty obvious, as you get a log of (nearly) everything systemd is doing to shut down the system. One such log entry you aren't likely to see in any circumstance other than shutting down or going to single-user mode is: 

If you get something else, the repository will be identified, and you can then disable that repo, contact its maintainer, suspect malicious activity, etc. If you get identical output, then you should be able to continue with the system update. 

Varnish only has a chance to help if most of the visitors to your site are anonymous, i.e. they never log in and participate. Requests by logged-in users cannot be safely cached at this level, and any reasonable web site will set (or perhaps if it's less well designed) to indicate this. However, your forum software itself may work against you. For instance, SMF sets and cookies even for anonymous users; the former breaks caching and requires extreme gymnastics to work around. This is utterly broken behavior, but I don't expect it to change soon. 

Yes, you can download the drivers from the upstream KVM project. If you want an installable RPM package, similar to that provided by RHEL, then you can use the virtio-win yum repository provided by the Fedora Project. 

You can set up to run as a daemon and email you when a disk error occurs. Add to the relevant line of the configuration file (e.g. or ). This is the line that usually begins with . 

Your FTP client trashed your files when you uploaded them. Be sure to set it to ASCII mode when uploading, or use SFTP. Or best of all, work directly on the server. 

If you need an IP address to last longer than that, you need to reserve a static external IP address and attach it to that VM. It will remain attached to that VM until explicitly detached, or the VM is deleted. 

You're not going to get a gateway address inside the allocated /56 or whatever IPv6 block that's assigned to you and routed to your premises. If you somehow do, you politely ask the ISP to put someone on the phone who knows what they're doing. Or perhaps less than politely. Usually, you don't have to worry about the upstream IPv6 address at all, as it will be autoconfigured as soon as you plug in your router. Most ISPs seem to be doing this with DHCPv6 (with prefix delegation), though it could also be done with straight up SLAAC if you have a statically assigned prefix. Once the /56 comes into your network, you can subnet it however you like. An example, with one possible (only partially fleshed out, and probably not very useful as-is) network design appears below. In any case, the IPv6 address of your upstream connection to your ISP is provided by the ISP and is outside your assigned prefix. You generally only need to worry about the inside interfaces. This example supposes you have an edge router with an integrated 4-port switch, such as many small business or SOHO routers.
