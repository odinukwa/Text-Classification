Depending on your motherboard it might be safer to put the slower module first. On one older system I had PC133 + 3xPC100 memory installed and the BIOS set the memory speed to 133MHz which ofcourse caused problems. In any case, running memtest86 for a night after adding the memory will tell you if the configuration you choose will work or not. 

If you want your digital canvas work more like reallife(tm) ones, I would suggest out trying Corel Paint 11. I used it and if I had any more skill, it would be my #1 choice for tablet painting. 

Your speed is quite similar to speeds I've seen on other 100Mbps networks with SSH. The transfer speed seems to depend alot on OS you are using, and not that much on the available CPU speed. On one network all transfers between PCs running Debian or Ubuntu Linux had 3MB/s speeds, but when I was using SCP on a Mac OS X server, I always got over 6MB/s. Also file transfers from a Xen server (which is running CentOS variant I think) also gave me higher speeds. Only time I've gotten faster transfer speeds with Debian Linux and scp are when I've copied data from one Xen virtual machine to another on the same Xen server, then I would get 20+MB/s speeds. With Samba shares, you usually can get to 50Mbps or so, and If you want speed easily, I would recommend setting up a FTP server, with that I usually can get 90Mbps easily, even from a Windows machine. 

I think it is probably due to cost and low demand. Manufacturing a high DPI LCD panel costs more and majority of people like to have 1920x1200 resolution on 24" monitor, so most LCD panels are manufactured to that size (and new trend seems to be 1920x1080) and that means cheaper prices. On laptops you really cannot make the screen bigger, not many people would be happy to haul around 24" monster laptop (I think Dell has one). So manufacturers are forced to put high DPI screens on laptops, but usually can also ask for higher price for these devices. Which is a shame as I really would like to have 24" monitor that does 4096x2560 and costs under 1000eur. 

Patterns change around between the same cells in other quadrants due to 1 bit color change (slightly red/green/blue). I didn't notice such a pattern going on my older d-sub display (if I'm not mistaken that was analog type video signal instead of digital). Is this some HDMI signal side-effect? Or is the display causing this? Or is this my graphics card? I don't have another comparable display to test this out on. 

The whole bar became a solid color, which didn't seem to be the average color of the whole bar. Pink, light-green and turquoise were prevalent, with much rarer brownish-tan and purple. Yellow only seems to occur right after the index becomes greater than 256. The weird thing is this persisted even after reloading uTorrent application and rebooting the PC. After the download completed, availability index lowered to 14 and the bar returned to normal. Naturally, I wanted to check things out again, so I deleted data and re-downloaded the torrent to see if this keeps happening. It does. Is this a bug or an intended feature? If so, what do these colors signify? 

I know VLC player can stream video and audio in several ways, and that it also has web interface along with some other ways to control it remotely. But can I make a local VLC player be able to control a remote one? Ideally, I'd like to be able to watch all my home library media remotely via stream in MPC with full control of playback, but VLC-to-VLC would be a good start. 

Winspector Spy app shows a log of all window messages sent and it allows to filter by specific windows. So I've managed to get a log of all of them, and now I'm gonna have to figure out which one of all of them is the scroll message that I want. 

then when you run an application from that terminal window, it opens its windows directly on your non-VM Ubuntu. 

Then connect to the virtual machine with ssh or with the virtual machine terminal and open up a terminal application and write: 

Connecting old SATA HDDs is fairly low risk operation, but if you want to minimize the risk, use an external USB-SATA dock. The most likely (still very unlikely) problem that might occur is your OS corrupting the data on the drive. This can be mitigated by mounting the drive read-only with eg. Linux live-CD/USB-stick. 

I don't think the signal strenght will be an issue, but using a DVI-splitter cable might give you better looking image, but they are known to have some issues (cheap ones atleast). I don't think there should be any problems as long as you don't try to run 1920x1200 resolution (your 1024x768 will work nicely) through that setup and use reasonably high quality cables. Actually, at 1024x768 you probably wont see any quality improvement even if the signal was kept DVI all the way. 

What you want is Dorgem, it should work on Windows 7 too, works nicely on 64bit Vista and many other Windows versions I've tried it on. Dorgem can be downloaded here $URL$ 

The application you are looking for is most likely dvdisaster. It can either create external recovery files or embed the recovery information directly into the empty space of each ISO image before you burn the. Later you can verify and recover these "enhanced" CD/DVDs with the app. As I don't trust optical media at all, I always add recovery record to all my DVDs with dvdisaster, it is fairly fast operation as long as you have quick harddisk. 

By default, the main window has each torrent listed individually. I'd like to place some torrents in a "folder" (imagine collapsing a branch in a tree view list). Is there a way to group torrents and collapse them in the main torrent list? 

I'd like to automate some things by starting an app when a USB wifi router is plugged in. How do I detect that in Windows 7? 

By default, in Windows 7 start menu the item "Documents" opens a library containing current user's documents folder and public documents. I'd like to change that behavior to open current user's documents folder. How do I do that? 

old solution using AutoIt Note: this solution may cause stuttering and occasional freezes on older CPUs or at full CPU load. I whipped up an AutoIt script which detects the cursor within the notes list area and if you scroll up or down, makes a click on the "up" and "down" buttons on the scrollbar. This works with multiple OneNote windows. You don't have to have focus on the window for the scroll to work, just hover over that list: 

Naturally, the headset doesn't appear in audio devices list. I tried deleting/removing it and reinstalling again, and the result is still the same as the first time. My usb-bluetooth dongle for PC can handle a PS4 controller, so it shouldn't be the cause. I also tried installing the headset on my netbook which has a built-in wireless module, but with the same result as on desktop PC. And I tried installing it on the WM6.1 smartphone, which worked just fine. Still, I'd like to find a way to use the bluetooth headset with a Win7 PC. There doesn't seem to exist a separate installation of a "Bluetooth Peripheral Device" driver or anything. It's supposed to be found automatically, but it's not. I also tried installing a Windows Mobile Device Center which didn't help. There was also a suggestion to get a similar thing intended for Vista x32 but it didn't even want to install on my Win7 x64. 

Previously I've been able to open links just by clicking them on Terminal.app. After updating my OSX, the terminal now gives Quick Look as default option for links. Is there any way to disable Quick Look on Terminal.app or change the order of actions on the context menu so that Open URL would be first option again? 

If you could have a Linux fileserver, you could put the FLAC files there and share the filesystem over MP3FS, it would transcode the files into MP3 on-the-fly when needed and there wouldn't be any need to store files multiple times. Unfortunately I haven't seen a similar thing for Windows. My solution there would be to write a simple script that monitors the FLAC-folder and would detect new files and transcode them to MP3 every night or something of that sorts. Not as handy. 

If security isn't a requirement, like in your case of running virtualized OS. You can open the X11 windows directly to your non-VM Ubuntu screen. This should in theory give you the best possible speed and lowest latency, though in some cases I've noticed that VNC does better job. The only drawback is that without some extra helper apps, you cannot close the connection the app and reconnect later. Lets assume that your VM Ubuntu has IP address of 10.0.0.2 and the "real" Ubuntu has virtual interface IP 10.0.0.1 and is the GW for the virtual machine (this would be something you would have with NAT mode. With bridge-mode, both OS have IP given either some external DHCP server, or they are set manually). On your non-VM Ubuntu you need to use xhost command to allow incoming X11 connection from the VM, to do this write on terminal application: 

Ok I figured it out by using a working fresh copy of Office 2013 on another computer. Start the MS Word application. It should look like this: 

Save this to a file, place it into the directory with all the zip files you want to convert and double-click it there. Thanks to Clint Priest for the base code. 

The total number of cores in both configs is 8 and that's twice as many as in the base config, so my guess is their performance is supposed to be 200% of base config, but then I'm not knowledgeable enough in this area to make a decent guess. Price is not my concern in this question, I just want to know how the performance changes if the total cpu core number increase is done within and outside a single processor. My personal interest lies in gaming and game development. I don't know about other games, but my own games I try to make multithreaded, so they could take advantage of all those cpu cores on my pc. 

This is what I ended up doing for myself: I took the font file from and edited all its emoji symbols to contain the "not defined" symbol at the very end of the Unicode range. Using FontForge editor, I copied it and pasted over all the emoji symbols (), and installed it as a system font, and gave it a unique name so it could be used in Firefox as a custom installed font (as described in the other answer here) and now every emoji symbol is a square. You could use an empty space symbol instead if you want, but then you won't be able to see where an emoji is expected to be, and it might be a bit confusing. 

I recommend using dvdisaster to add recovery record into the ISO image before burning it. DVDs that have been "enhanced" with dvdisaster can withstand multiple sector errors and still be recovered. Also you can verify that disk with the application. Only drawbacks are that you lose about 5-15% of storage capacity per disc depending how much you add recovery info and you need to create an ISO image first. Fortunately you can easily create a script that will enhance the ISO and then burn it automatically, so the inconvenience is minimal. And you sleep better as you know the media will still be readable after couple years. 

I don't know how much memory your displaycards have, but it is possible (though newer cards should be smart about this and not allocate all their memory directly) that they eat up all the available memory. In 32bit Windows your memory address space is divided in two blocks. First block from 0 to 2GB is accessible for you applications. The range from 2GB to 4GB is reserved for the Windows kernel and device memory. All your devices usually require some memory to work and this is mapped into the 2GB - 4GB area. Displaycards also map their internal memory there. If you have 2 cards with 512MB memory in each, that would mean 1GB of that memory would be allocated to their needs. As the video memory on displaycards got bigger, they began to map only part of their memory to that 2GB-4GB area, atleast when running 32bit OS. So that shouldn't usually be a problem. I would first try installing latest drivers for all devices and then try to boot with 4GB of RAM. If this doesn't work, upgrading to the latest BIOS might be worth a try, also you could try to go with smaller AGP Aperture -setting in BIOS as Drake suggested. And it never hurts to download Memtest to check that the memory isn't faulty. You could also try to enable PAE, that would allow you to use all of your memory. Unfortunately there are some device drivers that won't work with this setting. 

As you can see, my voice calls use a total of ~9700 bytes per second (~3500 B/s upload, ~6200 B/s download). 

Imagine this base configuration: 1-cpu board with a 4-core processor, performance is 100%. How different from that configuration performance-wise will be: 

This question comes from trying to find a way to make the mouse wheel scroll OneNote's list of notes in Windows 7. Apparently my netbook's touchpad driver sends such scroll events (when doing a two-finger vertical swipe) that makes OneNote scroll the list of notes on the right as intended. Normally scrolling with a usb mouse's wheel doesn't produce the wanted effect. I suspect I could remap the mouse scroll event for all OneNote windows to that special mouse scroll event which the touchpad driver sends using AutoIt/AutoHotKey and the like. But for that I want to find out what window message the touchpad sends. How can I see what scroll events are sent so I could solve my problem? 

If the keys feel sticky when you press them, it's usually a better idea to forget about this keyboard and buy a new one. I've soaked my kb in kvass a few years ago and no attempts of restoring it to the original condition succeeded. Water, alcohol, removing each individual key for thorough cleaning… It either will still feel sticky, or it will start making terribly loud noises with each key stroke because you'll inadvertently remove the key lubricant. Keyboards are not that expensive, it's easier to buy a new one. But if they are, make sure to remember this experience and never spill anything on yours again. 

This is very bad. How do I return it to the previous state, where the menu options and bookmarks do not cover the top of the drag area and it's big and you don't need surgical precision to drag the window?
