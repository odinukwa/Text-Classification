I had naively assumed that I should install Ubuntu to a RAID 5 array to give our in house dev server the best chance of having 100% up time. I have since learned that RAID 5 might be a bad choice for Dev (due to the cost of writes) and that putting the OS and filesystem on the same RAID is not necessarily a good idea (I thought it was a necessity and if the OS was lost, so was the array). We have 3 1TB drives. Would it be smartest to partition 100 gig of each for the boot sector, RAID1 two of those together (so the OS is RAID'd), then RAID 5 the remaining 900 Gigs per drive into a RAID 5 (effective storage of 1.8TB)? Or is a RAID 5 setup such a bad idea that I should just RAID1 two of the 1TB drives together (effective storage: 1TB) and sit on the third drive? We are looking to run virtualization on the server (its got 4 gigs of ram and a core duo 2.93 Ghz processor, am I in trouble there?). Thanks for any ideas or links. 

My father runs a small business and has had a growing concern about some of the web activity for a couple employees. He's asked that we have a way to report the activity, but its a bit over my head. Probably the most important part of this is that it is for a "small business" (less than 15 employees) and whatever the solution is would need to be cheap, but effective. Any recommendations for this? EDIT The budget needs to be in the $250 to $500 ball park. If the only options out there are all $1500, that would require some value proposition questions by the owner/father. So cheap is always better, but effective. The office basically consists of a single server with 10 laptops/pcs. The server acts as the domain controller, application host (IIS stuff), SQL Server, exchange, etc. We do have a CISCO "PIC" device that is used as a firewall. 

It's not clear why you are sure the problem is not caused by one of your endpoints (client or server), what type of traffic are you generating? Does it work with different device? 

Collect the traffic with tcpdump or a similar tool and make a graph of the packet count per time unit. If your assumption is correct, you should see a clear ceiling for the packet count. You may simulate a counter example by generating many large packets with something like ping -s 1472 -f, it may cause a small outage, so maybe do not do it during the traffic peaks. But 30 seconds may be acceptable for solving a larger problem - you decide. A switch can be easily the bottleneck as well. Especially cheaper one or a black box router. This was the most common case for a WAN network I was working on. The minimum standard for this kind of traffic was a HP ProCurve line thing. Even an old Cisco was fine as well. But you have to test it. Also good to mention that among ISPs we in generally used a rule of thumb that 60% utilized line was a fully saturated line. The reason why is that the saturation is basically average over some time of period. But on a shorter time frame you may have overloads by attempting to send just too many packets in the exact same moment which will lead to longer latency. Measure the latency as well. Wireshark is a good tool for a quick analysis like this. Last but not least, I have not seen any kind of traffic which can fully saturate the line but the ping -s 1472 -f on an otherwise empty line. Once you have multiple connections, you have inefficiencies which lead to lower utilization. Basically, 100Mbit is a theoretical limit under ideal conditions. So the line provider may be right as well and upgrading the line may be the proper solution. 

I set up my Windows Server 2008 R2 box to act as a DNS server so that I could address some of the computers by name instead of IP. I'm a little rusty on DNS, so you'll have to bear with me. I configured my router to use my Server as the DNS server for the network and can successfully address machines by name from within my network. I've set up a forwarder from the DNS server to a "real" DNS server out in the real world to handle all the other DNS requests (pretty much all web requests). Things seem to be working, I was just curious about the behavior of the Windows DNS configuration. No tutorial that I read made mention of a forwarder, but without me manually specifying one, all web searches failed (which makes sense, because my DNS server didn't define ANY .com zones). Is the Windows DNS server supposed to default to forward requests to a real DNS server? Or do I need to configure that forwarder myself like I did. Thanks! 

Is there a way to schedule a job on Windows Server 2003 [small business edition] that will create a backup of a SQL 2005 Express DB? I'm not sure if there is a native job/process for this on SQL Express or not. If there is not, how would I go about creating one? 

In Vista (business edition), how can you view who the local admins are on the PC without the user being an admin? Any command prompt method etc.? 

I've been asked to create a website that can identify the user's country and then route them to a specific site that was designed specifically for that country. While this task in itself is not terribly difficult using some Google API's, I'd like to know what the industry standard is for domains and different countries. As of now, each country has their own domain name and it at times is a sub-domain on a larger site. These are the options I've come up with, but would like to try and preserve brand image first and foremost and a single brand message is key to doing so. In bold is the domain name with the redirect that would occur based on country and potentially language preferences. mydomain.com 1. mydomain.us 2. mydomain.ca 3. mydomain.mx mydomain.com 1. mydomain.com/us/en/ 2. mydomain.com/ca/en/ 3. mydomain.com/ca/fr/ 4. mydomain.com/mx/en/ 5. mydomain.com/mx/sp/ 

How do you create a password in Windows Sever 2008 that forces the user to change said password on login? I'm creating the accounts for our team and would like people to change from the random password I generate for them. Thanks 

I've set up my Windows Server 2008 box to act as a DNS server for our network at work. I've got a couple machines with A records in the DNS record. Is there a way I can automatically include the domain in DNS queries so I don't have to use the fully qualified domain name? That is, I have a computer named dev1. Is there a way I can set up the DNS server so that I can instead of ? The A record for dev1 includes the IP address for the machine, so I can successfully access the machine using dev1.dev.mycompany.com. In addition, is there a way I can connect to machines by host name instead of IP? In the A record, it looks like whatever name I put will get mapped to the IP address. I'd like that to be the hostname of the machine. Is there a way to do that? Or do I just need to manually create the correct A records? 

If south and north are different IP networks, check routing table first. Than install wireshark on computer in question (or tshark if it is unix with shall only), one computer in north segment and one in south segment. Start monitoring network traffic and try connect to computer on north segment, save log. Monitor connection to south segment, save log. Monitor connection to internet, save log. Usually these things could happen: 1. you cannot see any outgoing packed - usually firewall related on local computer, check firewall 2. if packed goes out of problematic computer, you can see also arp request to destination IP if you see it also for IP from remote network, it is problem with routing table, if packet is routed correctly and still is not possible to deliver it, you should see ICMP packed with error explanation (in oposite direction) for example "host unreachable". 3. When you will compare traffic on source computer and destination one in south segment and you will see differencies, something disappeared in the middle. Check switches and wireless access points. If you has such possibility, than remove as much as possible devices between source and destination computer or change each device one by one and compare results.
