This may be due to the OCR software being used to convert image to text automatically. This happens when I scan textbook pages wih my Xerox scanner with OCR capability. Oftentimes, the text from the resulting PDF file mat not evem be accurate or has extra spaces or are on different layers completely! 

I don't think you cam do this. The Dell monitor above has a display port but does not explicitly say thunderbolt. Usualy, a monitor with thunderbolt has 2 connections: from the computer to the monitor, then from the monitor to another monitor. In this case, you can try using a USB to VGA/DVI/HDMI/DP adaptor to get the second monitor running, with first monitor connected via Thunderbolt (mini display port connection fits). 

Sort column A in alphaberical order. In another column, use the VLOOKUP function to get values for each name to populate on that column. 

Usually on graphics cards, primary display is DP > HDMI > DVI > VGA. If there are muliple DP, the first one is usually the one furthest away from DVI and HDMI. Also, check your cables. Some cables are faster and may get signal to the monitor sooner. As well, check BIOS to see if you can change settings for monitor. 

Create a new empty file called something like . Go to a file with the extension you want to reset and . Make sure is ticked. Then and choose the you just created. Delete . Double click the file again and dismiss the Open with box (this might not be necessary). Now open regedit and delete the following keys: 

I want the font, font size and which text is bolded or italicised to remain the same, but the paragraph settings and syntactic meaning to be set to normal (In the navigation pane each paragraph irritatingly comes as a heading, for example) 

This seems to me to be a major bug in Windows 10. But you can stop Windows Update to recover your internet connection. If you go to Network & Internet in Settings, then WiFi, then click Advanced Options, you can set the network as a metered connection to stop Windows Update. I suggest you do this temporarily so that you can actually use the internet. Here is a link to the issue in the Windows Feedback app, if you want to upvote it: 

You can choose which folders to sync - that is, which will show up in File Explorer and be stored on your disk. Unlike Windows 8.1, you cannot have 'online only' folders/files (i.e. no placeholders). Someone with a different account can access your OneDrive by right-clicking on the icon in the notification area and clicking 'settings', then clicking 'unlink OneDrive', but bear in mind they will only be able to access your OneDrive and not theirs through File Explorer 

Change the keyboard layout. Without the correct one for your actual keyboard, you'll experience oddities. 

Most likely the page there is referring to the maximum capacity of the memory controller on the motherboard. Thus, you will not be able to utilize any more than 4GB of memory. Should you however add more than 4GB of memory, your device will not be harmed, although you might not be able to use any of the memory. 

See point 1. Needed? That depends entirely on whether or not you want one. Last time I checked, you could also use the touchpad that is on the MacBook Pro. Should you want a mouse, you might want to get one that uses USB, and not PS/2. 

You can install Chocolatey exactly where you would like, and to make that easier, there's even some information written up on the wiki for Chocolatey about that! 

It seems that the problem you are facing, is in most cases a "security" feature - at least in the sense that many websites and applications will log you out if your IP-address changes after logging on. Thus, one login with associated cookies will only be usable with the same IP-adddress. The best part to remedy this is to make sure you do not have such a rapidly changing IP-address. A much more common dynamic IP-address would in many default server environments be at least 8 days, but this is surely something that is dependant on your ISP - not your own setup locally, provided you have a router. I personally recommend you contact your ISP if you have a configuration-less-modem, that they configure centrally, so that you can get further information on how often it is meant to change. Anecdote: where I live, it is much more common for ISPs to give you a new IP-address upon every reconnection. In which case, is your connection stable? 

Reseat the RAM. Or even better, swap out the 1GB stick with the 2GB stick to see if the 2GB stick actually works. You'll need to provide more details on the model or motherboard model. Some old board had the ability to take DDR2 AND DDR3 or DDR AND DDR2. However, you can't use both types on the same board, as they are used for upgrade purposes. 

In the Control Panel, open User Accounts and on the left panel, near the top, click on Credentials Manager. Add a generic credentials and see if the user can launch the program without your input. 

I had SQL Server 2008 Express (SP1) on Windows 7 Pro and it was working fine. After upgrading to Windows 10, SQL Server 2008 Express was still working normally. However, after the last Windows update (August 9, 2016), the service no longer starts up automatically. I can manually start the service and it works. I decided to upgrade to SQL Server 2012 (SP3) instead, but the service still does not start up automatically after a restart. I also tried to delay the automatic startup, but nothing happens. I checked all the Windows Updates and uninstalled them one by one to see which update was causing this, but to no avail. Even with system restore, rolling back to a month earlier, the SQL service still does not start. In the Event Viewer, there are no errors or warning regarding SQL Server. This machine is a standalone machine, not on a domain, SQL server is only used locally for my personal development exercises. I would like to avoid creating a .bat script and putting it in the startup folder. Although this solution works for me for now, I still can't figure out why the service is not starting. As for the SQL Server Express 2012 (SP3), I've uninstalled and re-installed with the default settings (Instance name SQLEXPRESS) and also tried using the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM account for the Database Engine. No luck. The only things I installed was the Database Engine and the Management Tools (Basic). SQL Server logs didn't really have any flags I could troubleshoot with. CPU Affinity, Memory and all other settings have not been touched. .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.5 have been installed if that helps. Question: How to get SQL Server service to start automatically when computer turns on? 

Disabling SkyDrive entirely via registry editor This method should work regardless of Windows version. 

Usage without trayicon: Just drag and drop your favourite application to gdi++.exe. Native Windows controls are also now in effect. Usage with trayicon: Just right-click the trayicon and select . 

I was trying to confirm your issue, but I have no problems changing the location of any of the folders within the user folder. 

You could use CloneZilla. Clone using disk files to an intermediary if you'd like, then clone from those disk files to your new SSD. I've done the same procedure myself when I only had a USB Mini cable. First I cloned the SSD to the external HDD, then replaced the SSD with the new one and cloned the contents back to the new drive. As long as your new drive has a higher capacity than the older SSD, this should be smooth sailing. 

The simple and "automated" way If you'd like to keep it simple, simply open upen an administrative session of PowerShell (if you need so), and run the following snippet. It'll do the steps above. 

1.a If they are both necessary, are there any benefits? The only "benefit" -- it's not really a benefit, as much as a requirement -- is that with SMB over NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), you'll actually be able to communicate with a greater deal of implementations of SMB. 2. What information/service does and provide? *My quick guess is that while simply provides the NetBIOS API, including NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) via port . On the other hand, provides the direct hosting of SMB via port .* 

Right-click on the Public folder and go to Properties. In the security tab, click Advanced. Go to the Owner tab and change ownership of folder to Administrator (or whoever you want). Once you have ownership, you can grant full control permissions for your user, then delete the public folder. 

I'd like to find all possible error messages any piece of software can output. Is this possible? Using Orca.Msi, I was able to get all the error codes and their descriptions, but this only applied to the setup installer. For the actual program, I tried using ResHack and found a few error messages from the program executables and DLL files. The problem with this is that not all of the error messages are shown. Is there any way to find all error messages for any given program without the source code? In particular, programs written in C++/C#, but tips for other programming languages are welcomed. 

You should still have access to your XP VM. The VM itself should be a .VHD file. If you are upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, enable Hyper-V in the Control Panel. Then, open Hyper-V and create a new VM. It will ask you of you want to create a virtual hard drive. At this point, you just need to browse to your XP VM ( the .VHD file) and this should be very similar to Windows XP mode. If you don't have Windows 10 Pro, you won't have access to Hyper-V. However, you cam still use Oracle Virtual Box, VMware Player, Paralelles, amd maybe some others. 

I'm planning on installing Windows Technical Preview on a dual boot on my (gasp) primary Windows 8.1 laptop. Naturally, the repeated cautions relating to this pre-release software have made me paranoid that my laptop could throw a BSOD or something. The SSD in my ultrabook has a recovery partition (well, 3 actually, for some reason), and I have also created a USB recovery drive. All the files I care about are on OneDrive, and I've made a system restore point. The only other USB drive I have now has the ISO for the technical preview. Should I be worried that I haven't also created a system image backup (control panel > file history > system image backup) on a USB drive? Or is that just overkill? As I understand it, a system image isn't much good without a recovery drive (and I can't have both as I don't have any more USB drives)? 

I have a folder of RAW .NEF photos which my Windows 10 PC isn't showing the thumbnails for in File Explorer (for this folder only - and actually it is showing thumbnails for only a few random ones). (These particular photos were taken with a Nikon D610 that I borrowed - higher resolution than more normal camera - but I don't think this should have anything to do with it. I have a copy on an external hard drive, and the thumbnails are showing properly when I plug that in.) I tried: 

Basically, all you need to do is copy the contents of your Dropbox folder to wherever you place your new Dropbox folder. If you do this before selecting the folder you're going to use, Dropbox will still spend some time, but it'll only be on the verification of the files that are already in the folder. 

To achieve this you can use GDI++, which is an application that renders the fonts on Windows applications with GDI instead of the typical ClearType. 

Move any other folders that are in the parent folder of your folder Fire up PowerShell, and navigate to the parent folder. Run 

With the specifications for your netbook, there's no reason why this shouldn't work just fine. Especially if you look at the minimum requirements for Windows 7. Clearly, you'll need to install the drivers for your netbook - but the differences between Starter and Enterprise lie not in the core department, and thus that shouldn't be a problem. I would note however that I highly doubt you havea volume license agreement, and thus installing Windows 7 Enterprise seems highly unlikely to be "legit". Just saying! 

However, if you type in とる and press the key twice, you get another set of results, one of which 捕る is included. 

Try checking your scheduled Tasks. You'll be surprised at what yiu may find. For example, Google Chrome and Adobe updates can be found in the Scheduled Tasks to start the serivice. If the scheduled Task is there, remove it and you should be good. 

If you just want to get ride of the tray icon, open Task Manager and end process for GWX.exe. Then, go to C:/Windows/System32 and right-click on the GWX folder and go to Properties > Security > Advanced. Here, change the owner from TrustedInstaller to Everyone or Users or Administrators. Click OK to close the Windows and you can now delete the entire GWX folder. Windows 10 shows up as an optional update, so even with automatic updates enabled, it shouldn't install without your permission. 

When I launch a Citrix application, I get this warning message. However, I accidently clicked on "Block access" and "Do not ask me again for this site". How do I go back to set this to "Permit use"? In fact, where is this setting stored? Registry perhaps? 

Combined with AutoIT, AutoHotkey or a batch script, this PDF-document (Command Line Functions => Using DTCFG-Configuring the Desktop => DTCFG Desktop Configuration Commands) may be of great assistance. From that I tried to create a simple AutoHotkey-script, but I am not sure if it works, nor if it does what you want. 

I think you're doing it quite correctly, but it seems like the class isn't available on your computer. Which, isn't surprising, as it isn't available here either: 

Save it as a as-you-want.ps1, make sure you've set your execution policy to Unrestricted (or sign the above and change it to AllSigned) and run! 

What you're doing here should work just fine - I myself have done it in the past and it usually works without hassle! However, if you're experiencing some issues it could be due to... 

Firstly, I'd like to make a note that only speculation can be done on the basis of the slightly vague question of yours. On the first hunch, such a problem would be attributed to the fact that an internal SD-card reader is just another device; to you, such a device may seem as an integrated part of the system, but only in the sense that it's a part of the casing/tower/notebook. The data link between the motherboard and the actual SD-card reader could be the culprit, but so could the SD-card reader itself be. This meaning that if the data link is slower than the data link between the USB-device, then you're going to get a slower performance. Other factors could depend on features such as write-cache, but such elements would usually be bypassed by benchmarking software. 

Change the thumbnail size Open the folder Properties (right click > Properties) and click on the 'Customise' tab , and make sure that the folder is optimised for Pictures. Tick 'Apply to all sub folders' and press OK Now open File > Change folder and search options. Click on the view tab and where it says 'Folder Views', click 'Apply to Folders' 

I'm trying to develop my first Windows UWP app, following this tutorial on creating a UI. When I have added a TextBlock to MainPage.xaml, I can't choose System Resource from the property marker menu for the Style attribute, in the Properties window. Why is this? Am I missing a particular Visual Studio component? If I try typing out the style specified in the tutorial , IntelliSense does suggest these. 

(Paste it into Edge) Update I've started noticing my internet connection being ruined even when Windows Update is not updating. In the task manager, it shows Service Host: Local System using up all my bandwidth. I tried going to Start > All apps > Windows Administrative Tools > Services, finding Background Intelligent Transfer System, right clicking it and clicking Stop. This stopped svchost using up all my internet. (I couldn't try the metered connection trick on this computer as it's connected via ethernet to a range extender) Not only is it my computer on which the internet becomes unusable, but every other device on the network. I don't know how Microsoft have achieved such a horrific bug. Update #2 This might not just be a problem with Windows Update and the Background Intelligent Transfer System. It looks like other background processes are also hogging bandwidth, e.g. I'm currently updating Adobe Photoshop and the Adobe Installer process is using pretty much everything, and web browsing has slowed right down (although not as badly as when the former two are downloading stuff).
