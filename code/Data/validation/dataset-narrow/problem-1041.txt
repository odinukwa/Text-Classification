It probably needs keyboard drivers to figure out what the eject button does. The eject button is not standard on a keyboard, so Windows probably has no idea what to do with it. Either way, have a look at this article from Apple's support site; maybe it will help you out. 

There was an addon for Firefox called Splitlink. It doesn't work for Firefox 3+, but it did work in Firefox 2. If you can find it anywhere (it's not on the official addons page anymore), it will give you more information about the real URL. 

Here's a tutorial on how you can reset the password. There are about 4 ways listed on the page on how you can do this so it shouldn't be that difficult. 

You have to have the fast user switching feature enabled for this to work. Maybe something disabled it. You can find more information in the article on enabling fast user switching: 

You could also use Winamp. Just open the folder in the winamps' playlist and then save the result as an m3u file 

Is it possible to play/pause a movie just by clicking on the window? I really miss this feature from Media Player Classic, but from what I could find, it's not possible in VLC. 

This should match only the first number and the comma: . If you'd like to gobble up everything else in the line, change the regex to this: 

Here's an article from Lifehacker dealing with this. It's not extremely complicated, I've used this a couple of times. 

When trying to install Windows 7 x64 on a new PC with a formatted hard drive I get the following error when extracting files: 

All document settings are stored in Normal.dot. Your best bet at changing the template is to just edit that file. You can find more information regarding normal.dot here. 

The app we use for development (CodeWright 7) is quite old and has Cleartype turned off by default. A newer version has the option to turn on font smoothing, but I'm stuck with this version and upgrading is not an option for me. Is there a way to force the app to use Cleartype? 

iTunes has Genius, which offers recommendations for your music. It's free, but you need an iTunes account for Genius to work. Also, keep in mind that iTunes is a resource hog. 

You could search for the tab character in the file. Go to Search -> Find..., in the Find what field paste the tab character (it will probably look like a box) and click on Count. Unfortunately, this only gives you the total number of tabs in the document, not the total number of tabs in the line, even if you choose the In selection. 

Don't run them in the same time! They might implement different relocation algorithms. This might lead to one breaking what the other has fixed. Also, it will grind your computer to a halt. Just use one disk defragmenter if you need to. Find a good one that does its job (the one built-into the OS is good enough) and stick to it. If it says the disk is no longer fragmented, there's no point in second guessing it. 

So you see, using something like Apptrap really does make it seem easy. It's just a few extra files deleted along with the app. Just as a quick note: AppTrap is no longer developed; however, it works perfectly in Leopard and the project has forked with the original authors blessing. 

Try using HFSExplorer. I know it can open dmg files, although it's best feature is allowing you to read HFS+ partitions. 

I want to be able to access my home network using VPN (preferably OpenVPN). The problem is that port 1194 is blocked by my current ISP and the only other ISP available does the same thing. The router is a DLink DWR-921; I connect to the internet via GSM (4G). Are there any options available? Could I use a non-standard port that's not blocked? Will this have any impact? The VPN server would be a Synology DS414. 

Try installing an app that can open j2k files (Picasa?). Then, to have previews, try using The How-To Geeks suggestion for Vista (I think it should also work in Windows 7). 

The easiest way to run such an OS is to use a VM. I've run Windows 95 in a VM with almost no problems. Unfortunately, the network card was nowhere to be found, so no internet for me. Windows 98 and up should not be such a major problem. 

Considering you're only using FCS for only one machine, you don't really need the extra features, so MSE is more than enough. 

Right click on the sound icon located in the system tray, choose Playback devices, select the TV as the playback device and set it as default. This should normally get your sound working again. 

Try using Magical Jelly Bean keyfinder. It should help you find the PC licenses. Here's a bit of information on the app, from the creators website: 

All you have to do is wait a little longer :). There's a thread on the Apple Support page about this issue. Here's the response from the creator of iCal Reply Checker: 

You can find some here for 15$ + about 12$ for shipping to the UK. Here's what the first reviewer says: 

Try VirtualBox instead. From what I remember, support for USB wasn't that great in VirtualPC. And VirtualBox seems better, in my opinion. The scanner will work in the VM, as long as the OS is 32 bit and you have drivers for it. 

What changed between yesterday and today? Try an offline installer and use the latest dev build, maybe it can solve the problem. Here's a direct link for the installer of the latest dev build of Chrome (6.0.408.1). This might seem strange, but I had problems with Gears, one of the plugins that Chrome has; I was able to start Chrome but when I went to a page that had support for Gears (Gmail, for instance), it crashed. The solution to that was disabling Gears (from about:plugins). 

Well, you sort of answered your own question, unfortunately. The newer Equation editor is not 100% compatible; some characters will turn out different in older versions of Equation editor. I think there is a way to save the formulas in Word 2007 using the compatible version, although I can't remember if it's possible. You can read more about it in this article. Here's a short summary: 

If you can see the same thing when using the built-in Disk Utility as you would see when running the Mac OS install DVD. Try Disk Utility first; maybe it can see the LVM partition; if it can, just reformat it as HFS+. 

There won't be any problems. They can both be installed on the same PC, without one messing up the other. They install to different folders. 

The problem is that certain apps don't provide a title for the system tray icons. Windows doesn't have a way of recognizing them if they don't have a title, so it doesn't remember the option to always hide. That's why certain icons just can't remember to stay hidden. 

The simplest way is using PDF Creator or something similar to it. It's free, it's offline and it's available for Windows XP. The only problem is that it's not portable, from what I know. However, there's a second way, but it's a bit longer. You can save the documents as a PDF (Word 2007 has that option). Then, use PDF-Xchange to save the PDF as an image. 

Why not try Handbrake? It's available for Linux, Mac Os and Windows and also has a command line interface, if you want. Here's a guide to the Handbrake CLI. 

Have you considered running a distro of Linux in a VM? It's seems the easiest way of doing it, because it does not involve repartitioning, dual booting, losing data; you also get a sense of how the OS would work if it was really directly installed on a PC. Another great thing is that you can work in both operating systems at the same time; it was very easy to just switch between XP and the OpenSuse that was running in the VM when doing development. Try VirtualBox; it's free and works quite well. 

I use a standard Windows keyboard, and activating Dashboard is also done via F4. I think the standard code for F4 is the one you're looking for; my keyboard has no special firmware to speak of, yet it can activate Dashboard without a problem. Hope this helps you! 

Take a look at this page when in Firefox. You'll find all the possible Google pages you might need, including the Australian version. When you find what you want, just click the link on that page. It will add the new search engines to the Firefox search box. If you need to add a search engine to Firefox, IE 7/8 or Chrome, you can probably find it over on the Mycroft Project. 

This review should help you out in figuring out what the differences are between the 2 processor families. In a nutshell: 

There's no way you can do it, but you could create a rule to move junk mail from the folder where they're placed to the default Junk Mail folder. 

Select the cells (or row) you want, go to Format -> Conditional Formatting... and add the rules you want. When you input anything in the cells, the formatting will be done automatically. 

Try this little tutorial. Or, if you want a simpler way, just right click on the file and choose to open with the application you want. 

You can find more information on this HP forum thread. Basically, the drivers for Windows XP are here, but you should read the whole thread for more info. 

There's no Print Preview in Google Chrome. You can find discussions about this topic in numerous threads on the Google support site. The best way of getting any kind of print preview is to use a virtual PDF printer, and just print what you want as a PDF. That way you don't waste any paper and you can see exactly how the printed document will look. 

Doesn't Ctrl + Alt (Cmd + Opt in Mac OS) take the control back to the Host OS? That's the standard way of doing it. Unfortunately, if that doesn't work, the host OS is hanged as well. The only way would be to press Ctrl + Alt + Delete (or Ctrl + Shift + Esc) to bring up the Task Manager. 

You could try using DoubleTwist; you can use it without having anything else installed. It's free and works on both Mac OS X and Winows. 

I've seen a Dell Vostro with the same problem. Looking on the Dell support site, I found a Bios update that fixed that exact same problem. I would recommend checking the Dell support site for a Bios update. 

If you have an iPhone or an iPod Touch you could use that as a trackpad. There are quite a lot of apps that you can use to control your Mac or PC via WiFi. One example is Touchpad, but you can probably find more. 

You'll find a lot of resources regarding Google Gears on the official website, including the architecture and security model. You can actually check out the source code for Gears, since it is has been released under the BSD license. Mozilla Prism is also open source, allowing you to actually look at the source code to figure out how it works. You can probably find more about its architecture on its website. 

Not everybody has a graphics card with DVI and, especially, DisplayPort. And not everybody makes a connection between these connectors and a monitor, unfortunately; everybody's gotten used to VGA, because it was (and still is) used on older monitors, quite a lot of modern LCD TVs and a lot of projectors. 

There's no option for something like this. The built-in Mail app doesn't have a lot of customization options, unfortunately. 

The problem I has with my Asus motheboard was that the voltage supplied to the RAM was lower than the one needed by the RAM, thus limiting the frequency at which they operated. A subsequent BIOS update fixed that, but it took almost a year for them to come up with the update. Maybe that's why the list is that short. Your RAM might work, but they might not perform as expected. Your best bet is to ask Asus support about this issue or post a question on the Asus forums; that's usually the best place for information. Also, check to see if there are any BIOS updates; they usually fix a lot of problems. 

Are you using the default, animated cursors? There are older cursor themes that are not animated at all. You should check and see if it's the case. 

GMABooster is most likely just snake oil: it promises a lot but delivers very little. It won't have any real, tangible results. And this bit of information from the site seems rather weird: 

Use this webapp to restore your Windows services to their default. That should hopefully fix things. Edit: seeing how this didn't work, I'll suggest something else. Try creating a new user account on the machine. See if the behavior is still there; this should at least help you troubleshoot your problem a bit. 

You can probably use DoubleTwist to sync your music and your photos to an iPhone. It's free and available for both Windows and Mac OS X. It's also a bit easier than using multiple instances of iTunes. Unfortunately, apps can't be synced; you'll have to still use iTunes for that. 

I had XP on the C:\ drive and installed Vista on D:. When I booted into Vista, it appeared it was on C:\, when I booted into XP, it also showed as C:. Vista functions differently from XP; when you start it, it shows it's on the C:\ drive. So all these letters don't really mean anything in the end. Just try and install Windows 7 directly, without making all these changes. Just pop in the Windows 7 DVD, format the Vista partition from the installer and continue installing 7. When done, the Windows 7 bootloader will probably figure out what to do with XP. 

If that doesn't work you could also try out Sizer. It allows you to resize a window to one of a few predefined resolutions. To save your icon positions, you can use DesktopOK . From Lifehacker: 

From what I know, ABBYY makes the best OCR software, but it's not free. You should try using a trial version of ABBYY FineReader, maybe it will help you. 

No, they're the same. You can read more here. But I think you have to buy the full price version; I'm not sure the Eula allows you to get the cheaper upgrade version; Apple said it's 29$ only if you upgrade from Leopard on an Intel Mac. 

Almost any modern processor can run Windows 7. Most processors made in the last 4 years have been 64 bit. A notable exception to this would be the Atom processor that powers almost all netbooks; this is 32 bit at the moment. Intel has been making 64 bit processors (I am not referring to Itanium) since 2004 (source here). There are no real disadvantages to running a 64 bit OS; apps and games are not slower (a lot of them might even benefit from the fact the OS can address more than 4 GB of RAM) and drivers are usually not an issue for modern hardware. Any hardware that in certified to run in Windows 7 must provide both 32 and 64 bit drivers. 

There's no clear answer to your question. It depends on the Regional Settings. For instance, I have my Regional Settings set for Romania, where I live; here, Aug 03 is wrong because the month is after the day. For the US it's the other way around. Also, Excel has both Date, and Time cells. Maybe you should consider breaking the date and time apart. If you write 8:32:44 it automatically detects it as time for me (hh:mm:ss). For the date, I would suggest using numbers instead of letters (08 instead of Aug); if you write it as 08.09.2009 it automatically detects it as a date (dd.MM.yyyy). Hope this helps you out! 

The DVD that comes with a Dell is a normal Windows Vista DVD. It will work on any PC. However, you cannot use the license that came with the PC; that cannot be transferred. 

Use lame from the command line (executable can be found here; there's also a tutorial on the command line options). Choose whatever settings you like best to reduce the size of your file; try using VBR (variable bitrate) and a bitrate of about 128 kbps. It should be more than enough to keep the audio quality to within normal limits. Listen to the mp3 and determine if it's ok. Just try going as low as you can while still maintaining at least some audio quality (use 64 kbps and check the output). The sound volume of the mp3's will get lower and lower and you'll lose most of the richness of the sound. Here's an example of how to use it:
