Note: If you don't want to use the browser built-in text cursor use instead of auto. This solution isn't perfect, ideally you would only disallow 

I would be much more concerned about the capacity than the speed with regards to 2GB of RAM. Programs are gobbling up more and more RAM these days - can use up to 1GB per tab (and I've heard of the browser using 5GB with only one tab open!). 8GB is the new standard, wasn't that long ago 512MB was. Filling up your RAM leads to swapping to disk (pagefile on Windows) which slows processes down significantly and in some cases (if the "hand-off" isn't done in time) the system will become so unresponsive it will "freeze". Versions of Windows that are 32-bit can support up to ~3.3GB of RAM; 32-bit Linux distros with a PAE-enabled kernel can support 64GB. Since you mentioned future, starting with [some] Nehalem (i3/i5/i7) generation CPUs and newer, Intel replaced the Front-Side Bus with the QuickPath Interconnect which among other things means the memory controller is on the processor in modern CPUs rather than the motherboard. This means the bottleneck is the CPU instead of the motherboard chipset (though it is still a factor) with regards to the memory speeds possible. 

You can use gitolite to manage user accounts specifically for use with git. cgit is a simple, nice webUI for git repositories that does not depend on PHP. If you want a full-fledged GitHub/BitBucket/GoogleCode localized setup then use gitlab It's worth knowing that each git repo is self-contained so you just need to set the ref to the host you desire. If it's that much for an initial pull per user, just host a clean copy of the git repo on your LAN and new users can copy that via FTP/SCP/HTTP and then simply to the latest. 

AirDroid. Transfer files over Wifi instead of bluetooth, much, much faster. If you don't have a wireless network available, then turn your SGS3 into a hotspot (may want to disable data) and have your Chromebook connect to the phone's Access Point (AP). 

Put the drives in RAID 0. Do you have a RAID card and/or hardware RAID support on the motherboard? Otherwise you'll have to do a software RAID. (Recommended) Install on one drive and create a mountpoint for the second drive to for example. (Legacy) 

Not sure about other plugins but at least for Flash Go to Set to False (double-click on it to toggle) 

That literally means gdb isn't in or is not executable. But yeah it should be installed to which would be in the PATH and the directory should exist. Moreover, the usual, which distro are you using? 

Keep in mind this is much slower than just 'ing the files but may prove faster in the long term if you are having to manually check each time. This also gives you the advantage of using a graphical filemanager (slow, especially if it starts creating thumbnails). 

Notice: reads and writes raw data with disregard to files, file systems, partition types, etc. Because of this, any error, any missing data can make the image worthless since the filesystem may not be intact. This is of particular importance if a harddrive is dying, there will be I/O errors which can make a dd image useless. Always verify backups. DD images are particular easy to verify, they are [usually] "all or nothing". 

A system connection allows all users on the machine to connect to that network. Newer versions of now label this setting for clarity. By enabling this and NetworkManager will attempt to connect to the network even before your display manager (where users log in) loads. 

You used for the recovery, didn't you? You didn't specify an OS but I'm going to assume Linux anyway. Save script to /root/removebadfiles.sh (and ): 

Delete /dev/sda2 (the swap partition) Resize/Move /dev/sda3 (Win boot), set the "Free space proceeding (MiB):" to 0 Resize/Move /dev/sda4 (Win7), set the "Free space proceeding (MiB):" to 0 New extended partition from the ~288GB unallocated space at the end of the drive New logical partition, size ~284GB, file system: EXT4, label: MyNewPartition New logical partition, size 4GB, file system: linux-swap Apply all operations (you may want to do this for each step individually but note the partition numbers may change) Change the UUID for the swap partition in Ubuntu's 

It's unclear what you are trying to do but based on "escaping list of files" I think this is the solution: 

It would appear depends on a specific version of the Lua library shared object file (liblua-5.1.so). The compile flags you used when compiling your own version of the library seem to be incompatible. Therefore you should determine your architecture () then download the lua i686 or x86_64 package from Fedora and install it with to restore to a working order. 

Yes, you should format the 4TB with a GPT partition table (as opposed to MSDOS partition table). As you will not be booting from the 4TB (you stated secondary drive) this should be a non-issue. I have a couple non-Clonezilla approaches to this. 

Make sure the package is installed. You also need the package for the second option. Don't worry about journaling and mounting as r/w, since you do not want to write to the backup. You need to be root to run these commands (i.e. use ) 

NOTE: This technique works in Linux, only assuming the same is true for OSX. To fix permissions in your home directory Open a terminal: 

As far as the window size requirement, most Window Managers will remember the previous size of the window. 

Have you read this? $URL$ The "sensor" is likely just a button that has been mapped by the driver in Windows to toggle the touchpad. Otherwise it would always function, regardless of OS (Motorola Lapdock's touchpad toggle for instance). You may be able to map it with or perhaps add it to , however perhaps you'd be better off with either detecting palm detection when typing or adding a udev rule if you are using a USB mouse. 

Try to recover the files using Keep in mind it will not maintain the directory structure nor the filenames (and it uses metadata to guess the file extension). Here's a step-by-step guide 

Warning: it's perfectly safe to delete the swap partition, however, any partitioning operation especially moving/resizing partitions is inherently risky. 

As stated, if you want the latest version without too much trouble you really need to upgrade your OS. 

Adding these fixes to JustBrowsing LiveCD, so this is win-win, thank you for bringing my attention to this. Lastly, if you come across a site that manages to get around these blocks, please leave a comment with the link. 

CentOS 5.4 is 3.5 years old but you can install the package to gain NTFS read and write support. The ntfs-3g driver is very good despite being FUSE. 

Bonus: In addition to saving notes it might also be useful to know if you've visited a link and how long ago you did (uses your history). 1.) Install Link Status Redux 

It's not that difficult to roll your own using your favorite Linux distro but here's a great resource VirtualBoxes.org for pre-built OVA images. If you aren't familiar with OVA images, I have a guide. Another option is Turnkey Linux that offers several web development "app" images in a few different formats. There are also a few specialized LiveCDs listed at livecdlist that you can turn into OVA images using my script iso2ova (you'll want to change a few things). 

When you use you need to detach with CTRL+A+D before you exit . Alternatively, if you want to run a process directly with screen you can use 

If that's the same model you have then yes, the manufacturer made it easily accessible to swap out the miniPCI-E card via the cover/door. Always remove the battery (and unplug from the charger) before attempting disassembly. However, on page 3 they take apart the entire netbook to get to the internal miniPCI-E slot. This netbook has TWO miniPCI-E slots. The one that is hard to get to is likely your existing 802.11 Wifi card and the easy access slot is likely either empty or contains a cellular "3G" card. Additionally, both of the slots on that netbook are miniPCI-E full-size. Your slots appear to be compatible with half-size and full-size cards. Caution, this is different from miniPCI. It's also not the same as PCI, PCI-E, ExpressCard, PCMCIA, etc. Plus there are two Hirose U.FL antenna connectors that connect to antennas inside the back of your laptop's LCD panel. Newer Wifi cards have three connectors but you can still make do with your two antennas. Also of note, replacing the harddrive on this model requires taking the entire netbook apart and much like getting to the internal miniPCI-E slot strongly risks damaging a fragile ribbon cable. 

I assume this is an embedded device, otherwise you should be taking advantage of coreutils, util-linux, etc. rather than busybox. Let me make this clear, busybox is not consistent across the board - various vendors strip out commands or cripple them to varied degrees. That said, blkid should be available. Run which will list the commands compiled into the busybox binary. Also note that often not all those symlinks will exist, so you may need to create them as needed. 

Is this a one-off or are you trying to script it? You could just open the file in any text editor and look for the line that starts with then run that. Granted, that's not going to "just work" on Windows, different executables, paths, etc. Perhaps you should post one of the .desktop files in question. 

For Firefox there is an extension called FromWheretoWhere that shows the full history of where each link came from. It's explained in detail by Ghacks. 

According to Crucial you have two slots, each that can take a 8GB max stick of PC3-12800 (DDR3-1600) RAM for a max total of 16GB of RAM. However, Intel lists support for up to 16GB of DDR3 1333 MHz which is PC3-10600. Currently you have a single stick of 2GB PC3-PC3-10666 (DDR3-1333) and conventional wisdom is to match the speed (though go for a higher capacity if you can). You mention you have a Sandy Bridge i3 CPU and you are looking for better performance. If you listed more specs and what you goal is that would help, though I suspect if you upgraded the CPU to an i5 or i7 (and Ivy Bridge CPUs are supported by the H61 chipset; you wouldn't gain native USB3.0 support and other features though) you'd see a substantial performance gain. 

Bash-completion scripts can help with parameters. You can install the wash shell a modification of with the whispering mod. Alternatively can be configured with some autocomplete (the ArchLinux liveCD has zsh by default and configured like that) 

Firefox 23 removed the options. Toggle Javascript You can install the QuickJava extension or Toolbar Buttons extension to toggle js, css, images, etc. There is also Tab Permissions extension that allows changing these per tab. 

6.) Close the tab/window/firefox 7.) Return to the same page later and the note will be there and in the same spot! 

It's not perfect but I made an interface to your specifications using gtkdialog (not to be confused with GtkDialog). It's just a script (depends on gtkdialog), and run. Download here. 

If you want it to be another modifier you could make it an additional Hyper for instance. Hotkeys As far as assigning shortcuts, nothing beats Compiz's Command plugin. Sadly, Unity seems to have crippled it. You can try your luck though. 

There are several Firefox extensions that can do this. FloatNotes works well. 1.) Install FloatNotes extension 

It's possible you are simply asking for a log rotater, in which case you can use the command with details here and here 

For GPT+UEFI bootable disks, partition 1 is a FAT32 "ESP" partition which is what you were seeing. The root filesystem for your old drive is probably on 

JustBrowsing uses the i3 WM (it has a single text-based configuration file) and adeskbar panel that contains some shortcuts and lockscreen, reboot, shutdown launchers (modified python file to disable editing panel). Virtual Terminals are disabled using a Xorg config file and no terminal emulators are installed. I discuss these details here. Don't lock down the browser (let users install whatever extensions they like) instead lock down the Desktop Environment as detailed above. 

Your best bet is to use a Linux LiveCD and investigate the filesystem. This will avoid any permissions put in place by Windows and sidesteps any malware tricks. 

Linux users maintain packages through their package managers and repositories not download websites, thus auto-updaters don't fit in well with the modular package ecosystem. CentOS 6.0 is from 2011, please upgrade to the latest release (6.4). The official wiki guide or using the package manager. is a shared object file not a package. Surprised was able to deduce you meant the package - which as the output states, the installed version is the most recent version available in the repositories you have enabled for CentOS 6.0. The reason more recent versions of Google Chrome require a newer libstdc++.so than the one you have (you can check which version you have using ) is that it was "compiled against" it (or rather linked with it). Chrome's source code is not open thus you are unable attempt to recompile it for your system. The open-source Chromium browser, which Google Chrome is based on, which lacks some proprietary functionality but is a usable alternative is something can choose to compile for your system. 

Are you using ? NetworkManager has a feature called dispatcher. Place scripts in the directory You can use this script to determine if you are connected. Save it to as root. 

It's a requirement for drives larger than 2TB but as far as 1TB goes, it's not a strict requirement. This is due to a number of factors including MSDOS/MBR versus GPT. Do you have a specific reason to use 512 byte sectors? Anyway, Linux to the rescue, just boot the GParted LiveCD and format the drive that way. You'll want to delete the drive's existing partition table, create a MSDOS partition table and then create your partitions. You'll want NTFS partitions for Windows. 

That keyboard like most bluetooth input devices only supports pairing one device at a time. You'll have to repair each time you switch between devices. The Logitech K810 keyboard and K811 let you pair up to 3 devices at a time and switch using the dedicated buttons. There also some other keyboards with this feature. Also any modern bluetooth keyboard should be OS agnostic, don't read too much into the marketing hype. (On a personal note, I would go with a USB RF dongle like Logitech's "Unifying" one instead of bluetooth for laptops and desktops) 

The only legitimate "booster" I've come across is Opera's "turbo mode" which routes network traffic through their proxy server and highly compresses it. If you'd like a real performance boost, you could install basically any Linux distro. Particularly one that uses a lightweight Desktop Environment and/or Window Manager. Good examples include: ArchBang (OpenBox), Puppy Linux (JWM), and TinyCore (FLWM). 

Block sites from disabling the right-click (context) menu Oh and apparently you can add the old Firefox options back using SettingSanity extension. . Note: SettingSanity not required for Firefox versions older than 23.0 

These are on LAN correct? You can use sshfs to mount the remote directory on your local machine. Create a mountpoint 

Creating a knock-off x86 compliant CPU isn't the same as a fake memory card. Worst case someone tried to pass off an older model but Intel changes the socket design every couple generations. Not to mention these CPUs also contain a GPU. 

Modern laptops include a "G-Sensor"/"Shock sensor" (a free-fall accelerometer) that signals to the harddrive to stop moving the head when the laptop is dropped to prevent a head crash. This is a non-issue for the solid-state drives (SSDs) that are becoming increasingly popular in laptops as they have no moving parts. 

The log you posted reveals the device ID is 12d1:1505 Googling I found this modem needs to mode switched According to the ArchLinux package manifest a config for your modem is present, so it should be included upstream and available for any up-to-date distro. 1.) Install the package 2.) Optional: If the udev rule doesn't kick in manually force it 

If you use a GUI text editor such as gedit/pluma and enable the option in the preferences then your is saved to upon save. You can enable this for nano with . Additionally cp with will create as well. Use a cron job to backup files in a directory regularly, you can even combine this with a VCS. I can include the script I use if you ask nicely. Use a VCS directly such as git and commit your files on a local repository (you can even migrate it to a remote location later if you choose) anytime you alter them.
