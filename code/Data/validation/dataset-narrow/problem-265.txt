I have no clue if this points any issue with stoage. Now the concern is, before we did migration i had similar error messages on the this instance but they were like coming after half hour 2 hours or may 15mins. no fixed pattern. But after migration above error message keeps coming every 2 mins from the day we migrated. That is what sounds alarming. On the old server from where we migrated, yes we had similar messages but again there was no fixed patterm, sometimes 2 mins, an hour may be after 4 hours, but not continuous like on new server. I got some info here $URL$ But still i am confused how to deal with this and what exactly these messages point dba's to look for? Please suggest 

I waited for almost 4 hours, trying to shrink in chunks, but not even a single MB got shrinked. Is there a way this can be done or how can I manage the unallocated space? Please advise. 

We have set up LS to do cutover from standalone SQL server 2012 to clustered 2012 servers. The primary database where we have set up LS is also involved in database mirroring and is about 1.8 TB in size. This is PERF env to test the actual cutover and transactions are not frequent on database where LS is set up. Issue: I see that LS backup job on primary runs longer than scheduled [every 15 mins] or fails with below error: 

Nothing found from error logs on Principal. However on secondary when we resume error logs seems to have stack dump logged every time. Any help on how to resume the suspended mirror apart from rebuilding mirroring from scratch? 

Apart from above we have PRIMARY FG with mdf data file set to unrestricted growth. All are set to auto grow by 10 GB Now, i see alert for Filegroup FG being FULL and rebuild index job failing with same saying "could not allocate space for object within the table tb1 for the database above because the Filegroup is FULL" But if i see from above data files tagged to FG, we still have 70 GB left, then how come its failing ? Please suggest how SQL works here in allocating new data for case above? Edit 

I am trying to figure this out and seems to be out of thoughts and need your inputs to help me figure out on this. We have implemented SSL across our 200+ servers, SQL2012 & 2014. These cert are valid for 9 months . These are from vendor symantec. Now the problem is tracking when they get expired. Keeping a manual track of these many servers are tedious. Is there a way we can pull this up from SQL to get the information and create an SSRS report to check when they are going to expire? 

Need your suggestion on how below works. Situation: We had unsent log on Principal stuck for almost 10 hours with unsent data around 200 GB. Action: Paused and resumed the mirroring. This kicked of the stuck mirroring. All 200 GB is now send to mirror and its trying to restore. But when new transactions are showing up on principal i see that again the records or mirror seems to stuck showing send rate 0 KB/sec. So my question would be , is this suppose to happen and block unsent log on P till all previous 200 GB is restored on Mirror or there could be different problem here? And can we again PAUSE and RESUME mirroring if mirroring is still synchronizing ? Please suggest 

Rebuild the endpoints--> no luck Resume the mirroring with partner resume --> no luck DBCC CHECKDB shows 0 errors found on either side. 

Initially the Service broker somehow got disabled on this database running ssis packages using conversations to process messages. Still wandering how it got disabled and not getting enough info to find. please suggest where to look when i enabled it using , it enabled SB but seems to have clear of the messages i see in . But the issue is i dont see those messages coming or starting. so i am back to my original issue of service broker not working. How can i troubleshoot and get this working 

I am not sure if in am checking this correctly. But i can see the discrepancies in the value of compressed backup size from msdb.The value of compressed size is different what i see on the drives. These backups are taken from Litespeed. e.g Litespeed backup compresses the backup of database to 1 TB for 8 TB and msdb shows that value in column as 4 TB. Is there a way to get the correct information using SQL for third party backups? Query used: 

I am trying to find the cause which have bloated the mdf of a database from 20 GB to 100 GB. So far i tried checking the autogrow events to find time, but could not find none using standard reports and even default trace files. We don't have 3rd party monitoring tools to confirm if any maintenance job like rebuild would have done or any other process. How can i find what caused the growth on this mdf? 

Implementing CDC is something i am going to do first time here. We are going to start with lower environments and then towards PROD. I have configure CDC in DEV and QA where we do not have the size of DB configured for CDC that big. However in PROD, that DB is somewhere 4 TB. We are implementing to some of the big tables which are almost 500+ GB. Analyzing lower env' was not much of help in understanding the growth of change tables. Therefore my question would be how to estimate the additional storage/growth that may be required for assigning to FG tagged to CT tables participating in CDC? How should i plan the amount of disk space that might be required so that in PROD, i should not be running out of space before the retention time set on CDC job. [ Our retention job clears data 3 days old] 

Experts, Need to know if anyone has witnessed or found such settings while patching SQL servers for Meltdown patches. Our sys admins informed that OS patches for Meltdown can be turned ON/OFF bases on registry setting and can be enabled or disabled. Just looking if someone know a similar way available for SQL server patches? Means you can turn it active when needed? 

On one of our current prod servers, we have one of the data drives going out of space.[Somehow we have created 2 GB space for now] Now we are planning to move one of the database in different drive which is almost 20 GB. But this database is not accessible state. I was thinking of backup/restore way to move, but it wont as it shows in unavailable state. When I checked the SQL logs, it says transactional log of this database got full. So I checked its state using log_reuse_wait_desc which says "ACTIVE TRANSACTION". How can I get the database available and ready for move so that I can move via backup/restore? Additional Info: Database status shows "SUSPECT" Please suggest. 

I need your help in understanding/resolving one of the issues we are witnessing today. We have a high value of unrestored log on secondary side where value keep ranging from 5-10 GB as monitored. Simultaneously we have a job to create snapshot on this mirror [for reporting] server every 30 minutes which completes within a minute when unrestored is within MB's but keep running for 2-3 hours with high value of unrestored log The database here is 10 TB and OLTP with DB in high PERformance mode. Could someone explain why the snapshot job is running that long or how to find it and fix high unrestored value? Or could it be Vice-versa and i am thinking wrong as mirror causing snapshot to run that long? 

Adding more info while troubleshooting shows 0 rows while for similar db in diff env i get almost 5-6 rows. Not sure what does that mean 

We have an issue with database mirroring on one of the databases on our sql instance where mirroring is suspended for almost 15 hours now. DB is 200 GB on SQL server 2008R2 Sp3+cu with latest patched done for meltdown. so far we have done below 

Please advise how can I arrange them or what should be the guidelines to make a better indexes before dropping them. 

I would need some practical suggestions on how to achieve below: We have quite a few servers involved in database mirroring. As part of various activities and other fixes, we have database failover happening now and then. What i am generally doing is browsing the sql error log to find the failover details for most of them Is there a way , we can store or track the failover details for them either locally on server, say saving all that details in a text file or on repository server? Thanks 

I am confused or do not have better understanding on how SQL works in below scenario and need some views: For a database X, we have a FILEGROUP named FG which has 4 data files tagged to it as below 

Due to lack of my knowledge in service broker i am finding hard time in troubleshooting Service broker in one of the databases.

I am trying to gather some stats on comparison of run time vs performance between Litespeed backups and sql native backups. As we are no longer going to use Lite Speed [even though i personally loved that SW], have to gather metrics how SQL will perform using native compression backup] So i am looking for a way to reduce CPU usage to X % while taking native compression backups. In Litespeed we just specified this option in advanced tabs and saw everything running fine. I am aware of resource governor, but due to some constraints not able to use it. Will need to work on that. But is there a better and smarter way to do this. Please suggest Edit.. Have to add, as per security and company policies we cannot use third party or external SP's to be created. I saw this can be achieved using OLa 's script as well, but we wont get approvals to introduce this :(
