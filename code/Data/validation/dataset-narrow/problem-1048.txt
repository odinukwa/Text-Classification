You can't do, what you want to do. At least, you can't do what I think you want to do... because what you are not very clear with the details. See... 

Well... for a desktop, you could purchase a Gigabyte iRam which turns 4 1gb DDR sticks into a 4gb drive. Yes, that's not all that much space, but it is an extremely fast drive. There weren't many (any?) consumer grade motherboards that would utilize a ton of DDR or even DDR2 Ram. You'd only find that in server grade equipment. As far as laptops go, only high end custom equipment would support more than 2 sticks of Ram. Clevo/Sager made units that would use 4 or even 8 sticks of SODIMM Ram... but as has been pointed out, the cost of purchasing equipment just to use the Ram would outweigh any benefits. For the Newer DDR2, you could use something like the Acard which supports up to 8 sticks of DDR2 (64gb total) and turns it into an SSD. 

Turn off Airport Switch off the built-in firewall (found in: System Preferences>Security>Firewall), and set it to allow all incoming connections. Turn Airport back on again 

You would use pretty much the same technique. EDIT Except you wouldn't screw up and leave a small amount of feather on the selection tool like I did :( 

and the whole thread it comes from does provide multiple configuration options that may enable you to get three monitors (using the DP1.2 with DVI converters, etc.) 

Just to make sure you know... you won't just be replacing the processor. You'd be replacing the motherboard as well. No, don't get insulted. I'm not assuming that you didn't know this. You didn't mention it, so I did. What happens when you put a dedicated video card in a system with an integrated video card? Well... let's put it this way. Let's assume you choose Windows. You install Windows on a computer with an integrated video chipset/cpugpu. You install the drivers and get everything working nicely. You then decide to add a dedicated video card. So, you turn off the computer, you plug the card in the slot, you turn it on. What happens? Depending on the settings in the BIOS, either the card is automatically detected as the new primary, or it is ignored as the primary display device during the Boot sequence (since the onboard video was previously the primary). However, the BIOS won't automatically disable the onboard. Once you are back in Windows, you will now have two video adapters available. You can go into the BIOS and disable the onboard video, which will free up any shared video memory. Right there is the main performance difference. The onboard video chipset will borrow some of your system Ram and make it unavailable to the rest of the system. Using a Dedicated video card will enable you to free that Ram up for the system. It is up for debate whether the integrated GPU steals CPU/processing power. On the one hand, empirical evidence gathered while watching a CPU meter says it does, yet there is no documentation or benchmarks to back that up. As has been said, the only difference there between older integrated chipset motherboards and these new Intel/AMD chips is that the GPU is built into the processor, instead of the motherboard. The Processor remains as powerful as it is, regardless of whether you use the integrated video. Which is better? Your Radeon 6800. By Far. For what you do, having as much Ram as possible is always a good thing... so not losing any to Shared Ram is a good thing. Also, you'd see better performance in your 3D rendering program (not necessarily the speed of the rendering, but the display while you are working) with the Radeon 6800. 

Those lines are being generated by the graphics chipset. There is nothing wrong with the laptop's LCD. As random as you might feel they are, look again at the image you included. There is a predictable pattern there. This could be caused by corrupted VRAM, or by the GPU itself. From what I can dig up on model number, the GPU is using 128mb of dedicated VRAM, so you can't blame shared system memory... which is too bad. You should be able to confirm this by connecting an external monitor to the VGA port on the laptop. Bad VRAM will cause the lines to appear on the external monitor as well. A failing GPU can also cause the lines to be replicated on an external... but either way, this is how you eliminate the LCD as being suspect. I'm giving you this diagnostic step to follow to give you more peace of mind, since those lines really do point to (95%) video memory issues. Since the GPU chipset is integrated into the motherboard on that laptop, which means the video memory is also integrated, you are really looking at replacing the motherboard.

Cable Internet. With cable internet broadband modems, once you have connected a device to it and have gotten an internet connection, the modem logs/remembers the MAC address of that device. So, if you connected the Cable Modem to the Router, the modem got the MAC address of the router and it remembers it. If you disconnect the router, and connect a different device, like... say... a computer, the modem sees that there is a different MAC address now attached to it, and doesn't allow an internet connection. You would need to power the Cable Modem off for a few seconds, then power it on. At that point, it would grab the MAC address of the first device connected to it and work again the way it is supposed to. Now... the Coaxial cable that connects to all your televisions, is also connected to your cable modem. You cannot connect that coaxial cable directly to a computer and get internet access. It has to connect to a modem first. If you were actually talking about how you unplugged the ethernet cable from the cable router and plugged it directly into your desktop, you would need to power cycle the modem to get it to work as I described... however, this would kill internet access to your wireless router, and every computer connected to it. So. How do you get internet access to this desktop, when your internet connection is handled by your wireless router that is in another room? You either need to run an ethernet cable from that router to the desktop, or you need to get a wireless card for that desktop. Well... you could also get a pair of Powerline Ethernet Adapters, but then you ALSO need a couple of ethernet cables. 

The PSU. You put in a brand new one? It will most likely be pushing out that "electrical" smell for the first few hours of operation... like a day or so. If it's not brand new, then I'd replace it. 

Your question does not require any knowledge or information that you cannot get easily yourself. Simply visit any number of websites that allow you to customize a PC online, and choose the options that match the specifications of the Mac Mini. The site will then present you with the price of the PC. Here are three sites to start you off. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Otherwise, if you do not want to do the work yourself, you are just being a bit lazy. No insult or offense intended. You just have all the information and tools at your fingertips. This site is not just to make people do work you could easily do yourself. 

That's a heat sink from a C655... and that's only after a year and a half. If you have no idea when yours was cleaned last, don't obfuscate the issue with how "well" it runs with Windows 7. Get it cleaned, and imagine how well it will run with ANY OS. 

MS has a specific fix for this error in how it relates to a video capture card. Just pointing out how that error code is not specific and limited to just your issue. Either this was you, or someone else had this SAME problem, and posted about it Yesterday at Microsoft's Answers site. They got advice, but there is no confirmation that the advice worked. So, you might not be alone in this issue. Here is a long thread about someone who lost sound AND had your issue.. and there is some very detailed repair work that is suggested Here is someone who is getting this error when they installed a program and tried to use System Restore. Someone else reports that error with a server installation, when attempting to save specific data. ... and here's a thread about someone with that error code, and a video capture system... What's my point in mentioning all of that? If they have anything in common, it seems to be related to writing data to a hard drive. No, I'm not saying that your drive is failing, but the error of 

I'm looking at the chain of events here, but it's a little fuzzy as to what happened and when. EDIT Ok. Looking at your detailed chain of events. The new video card was in contact and/or in use with... 

^^ that is a more generic image, that clearly designates it as a CMOS related jumper You would set the jumper from the position it is always in, to the only other position available, power the system, power it off, and return the jumper to the original position. Again, this is a very generic solution. As to your specific motherboard, you should examine the user manual found at Asus' support site. You look up your specific motherboard, you download the manual for your language, and you find the section dealing with clearing the CMOS. Depending on the motherboard that you have, there might even be a specific power button action that will clear the overclock settings, so that you don't have to actually clear the CMOS... however, again I don't know anything about your specific motherboard. If yours does have this feature it would be in your motherboard's manual. Clearing the CMOS will return the overclock settings back to the factory specs, so if your overclock is responsible for the system not booting, it should boot normally after you clear it. The fact that it is an Asus motherboard has nothing to do with it "breaking". You may have simply overclocked it beyond the capability of your CPU. This can happen with every board manufacturer. 

Ocularis PS is a comprehensive surveillance system solution that includes video analytics that can be set to review video for movement... but would probably be quite expensive for just this one task. Gotcha is a small program that can be used to view live or recorded video and includes a motion detection feature. ContaCam is a free solution that offers the ability to review existing movies and motion detection, but I don't know if you can combine them both. But, as it is a free option, it's definitely worth looking at. Otherwise, most solutions offer motion detection as a feature of what is recorded by the software, as opposed to monitoring an existing recording. Then again, you could always just open the raw video in an editor, and play it at a high speed, looking for movement. When you see it, you pause, back up a little, and tag those sections. 

What does it do? It "intelligently" switches between the NVidia GPU and the Integrated GPU in a system. This is to save power. If you are surfing the web, reading your email, there is no need to be using the more powerful NVidia GPU. This would shorten the charge life of your battery, requiring you to recharge it sooner... if you were using it all the time for mundane tasks. Since the NVidia dedicated GPU also generates more heat, this causes your laptop to run hotter. Laptops in general have issues shedding heat in the best of circumstances, thus generating more heat when it isn't necessary is typically frowned upon... performance-wise. Now... with Optimus running, when you play a game or use a program that requires more GPU, the dedicated NVidia GPU is turned on and you get all the joy and happiness associated with a powerful graphics processor when you need it. Turning it off will typically disable the dedicated GPU altogether, saving battery power but making your game performance suck. 

Every time you load an operating system, that OS needs to load the hardware drivers. Even if you are loading from hibernation, it still loads/refreshes the drivers again. Try it... uninstall a driver in Device Manager, and immediately hibernate. When you restore from hibernation, the driver is there in Device Manager again as if you had restarted. You need to pair the bluetooth devices after the drivers have been loaded. The only way to keep the bluetooth devices connected, is to keep the bluetooth receivers active. The only way to keep them active, is to not unload them from the system. The only way to not unload them from the system, is not to shut down the operating system that is accessing them. Now, if you were running one of the operating systems in a virtual machine, that's a whole different ball game. But since you are not, and since you actually reboot between changes, then no. There is no way with your current usage choices to make the bluetooth devices avoid having to be re-paired each time. 

Use Camstudio. It's free, and it makes a video of your desktop, and whatever you choose to display. So... start recording, record a short video of the animation, then edit the video and crop out everything you don't need. There. You've now got a video you can either embed in your presentation, or convert to an Animated GIF file. EDIT Ok, so you want to embed the AVI file you made of this into the presentation. According to Microsoft... 

So, in other words... Yes. You should use "battery gauge reset". Of course, knowing how old the laptop is, and how old the battery is might make a difference... like between recommending reconditioning or getting a new battery. 

Does your computer have an Optical drive? You know... a CD/DVD drive? Can you download a disc image of Ubuntu? Do you have access to blank discs? Do you have the ability to burn a disc from this ISO of Ubuntu that you have downloaded?
