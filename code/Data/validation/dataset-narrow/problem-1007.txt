My laptop from time to time displays the blue screen of death and performs a memory dump. When the laptop is rebooted from the memory dump, I get the follow error. I have since performed a system backup restore but still couldn't make the problem go away. Please help! 

I've purchased a recovery USB from Lenovo for $39.99, but my laptop would not boot from it. Lenovo technical support refuses to provide me with any hint on how I can get it working unless I pay $69.99 more to them (even as my laptop is still under warranty). Despite having been a customer with them for more than 10 years, my experience with them had been particularly frustrating. They wouldn't provide any support for the recovery USB (which I purchased from them). I would like to think I'm somewhat savvy with computers and have done research on my own on the internet regarding this issue. I suspect the issue with my laptop probably has to do with the UEFI boot mode and the Legacy Boot mode. I've resetted all BIOS settings to the factory default. Currently my laptop's BIOS boot mode is [UEFI]. This should be the mode that was selected when I first received my laptop. The option for USB Boot is [Enabled]. The option for Secure Boot is also [Enabled]. I don't know what else I can do to boot from the recovery USB so I can restore the operating system to initial state. I'd really appreciate if you can drop me a hint. Thank you for your help! [additional notes] The laptop came with Windows 8.1 and since I've upgrade my OS to Windows 10. I've been having problems shutting the computer down properly. So I want to revert everything back to the factory setting 

Now you want to draw an image of the local supermarket, which is bigger than your house. So you need 12 pages. You could start at page 11, which means you'd have not enough consecutive pages and you need to continue at 18, or you could start at 18 and have enough space to draw it in one go. Most or all operating systems are smart enough to choose a chunk of free space that is large enough for the whole data, but if there is no sufficiently large free space, it will have to divide the file into smaller pieces that fit into the existing free areas. This is called Fragmentation. Let's imagine you also need to do that. Your TOC looks like: 

Now we start READING the book. You want to know the items on your shopping list. The TOC tells you to go to page 16. You start reading until you reach the bottom of p.17. Done. Next: you want to see how the supermarket looks like where you want to go shopping. The TOC tells you to go to p.11 (you are on p.18 (= end of p.17) and have to browse 7 pages back. On a hard disk the read-write head needs to do a jump. Then you start reading until you reach end of p.15, then you browse to p.18 (head jumps again) and continue. Browsing in a book takes less time than reading, but on a hard-disk it's almost the other way round. The head cannot just move to the next track/cylinder, but has to 'search' the correct cylinder (acceleration, motion, deceleration, settling time). See Wikipedia. So due to fragmentation your reading takes longer than if the file was stored consecutively. And now, we do READING WITH 2 PEOPLE: You want to see the supermarket image and I want to read your text A. You browse to page 11 and start reading. When you have read p.11, I browse to p.1 and start reading. When I have read. p.1, you browse to p.12 and continue reading. When you have read. p.12, I browse to p.2 and continue reading. ... you can imagine that it takes a lot longer to read the pages just because the many browsing takes so long. Same with your hard-disk. You can't do nothing about it but avoiding simultaneous access as this always makes it slower. Now, finally, the YES answer: YES: Buy a SSD. This is a electronic disk and it operates like RAM, so you have almost no seek times and the total throughput is always close to the maximum possible throughput (if there are no other bottlenecks elsewhere). 

On my iPad, I tried to remote control a computer on my local network and open a video on it, but it wasn't fast enough (the video refresh rate was terrible). I've purposely tried to connect to the local area IP 192.168.0.xxx, my router touts 54Mb/s of transfer rate. What do I need to do to make my view of the video on the remote PC more fluid? Added (after reading keen's answer): For example, if I want to stream from twitch.tv, that's hard because twitch.tv's ipad app doesn't work the majority of the time, so I can't really go directly to the "source". Other times when i'm browsing a site on the computer, and it streams a video. I want to sit on a sofa and watch it. It's inconvenient for me to type in the address on my ipad's browser again to go directly to the source. And this is a small website that hasn't created an app yet. 

Accessing 192.168.1.1 was supposed to be quick and easy because it's accessing something "local". But it has been problematic with my Linksys WRT54G router. I have attempted visiting 192.168.1.1 through both wireless and Ethernet cable. Many times, the loading circle would just turn and turn but never pull up the router Management GUI. Sometimes I could load into the Management GUI, but when I, say click on a link in the Management GUI, sometimes the link doesn't load (the loading circle would turn and turn and never found the page), sometimes I get luck, the loading circle turns and turns for about 30 sec and then the page is loaded. This is with both wireless and wired Ethernet connection. Lately this router is having issues, sometimes it would just die (decides not to serve [or transfer] data to computers on the network). I must unplug the router's power and then plug it back in to make it working again. I have considered that my firmware may be out of date. What do you think is the problem with this router? Note: It's very strange that after the router dies(supposedly doesn't transfer any data to computers on the network), if I had a torrent connection established prior to router dying, the connection continues to transfer (download). [I have not try to see if ordinary file transfer would also work] Added: I was hoping to make my router more robust, so I upgraded it to DD WRT. Router connectivity problem already existed before the DD WRT upgrade. I have not changed any default settings in the DD WRT. Currently, this router serves 3 laptops at home, plus an ipod touch, an Android mobile phone, and Ethernet connection to a VoIP phone. 

You could check on the target computer, which user account was used to create the connection. There's a Windows tool , try that. 

The shutdown command DOES work, but you need to enable it on the target Computer. Therefore search the Internet for "remote shutdown token filter policy". Secondly you need to authenticate on the remote Computer in order to be allowed to execute the showdown. The shutdown command does not provide a functionality to transmit logon credentials, so you need to send them on a different way before doing the shutdown. I suggest you map a network drive for that purpose. Works well for me. You don't need to create a network share on the target just for that, use IPC$ instead. Notice: you need to logon on the target with credentials of the target Computer! The local rights of these credentials are not relevant; the target user may not even exist locally. AND the target user must have sufficient privileges to shut down the target. 

Spoiler: There will be a YES answer at the bottom of the post Short answer: NO. Medium-sized answer: NO, because there are 2 processes that want to access one ressource (the hard disk) at the same time. Each process will read different data, so the head needs to jump to the place where the process needs data from the platter. This jumps take a lot of time and decrease the total throughput of your hard-disk a lot! Long answer, because you seem to lack some (basic) understanding of the working principle of a hard disk: NO, because your spinning platters hard drive behaves like a book. Imagine that you have a book with only empty pages. That's your hard disk when you buy it. No data stored on it. Then you put it into your computer (let's say as a 2nd drive, so we don't have to deal with the operating system here). When you write a long text document (called 'text A') and save it on the disk, then it's like writing the first 10 pages (pages 1 to 10) in your book. Then you copy a jpg picture onto the disk, that's like make a drawing of your house on the next 5 free pages in your book (p. 11-15). The table of content of your book now has 2 entries: 

I have a Linksys WRT54G router with firmware v8.00.8. When I visited the Linksys support website trying to download new firmware update, I saw an option to "select hardware version." In that drop down, 8.0, 8,1, and 8,2 are all available. Should I selected 8.2 to download because it's the latest one or should I download the 8.0 because my firmware is v8.00.8? This is a bit confusing. 

A few days ago, my HP Pavilion dv-1413us battery charging "bolt" LED light started flashing and it would not charge the battery until full (stops at 94%). I unpluged it and used battery, and now it only charges to 82%. What is wrong with it? I've tried the power reset here, but it still wouldn't charge fully. Please help! 

When one encounters this problem. He/she could set IPv4 manually to 192.168.1.10 and attempt to ping the router through a Ethernet cable at 192.168.1.1. If you can ping the router successfully, that means the router is still alive. Then it means communication with router is possible. 

My laptop has a Matshita uj8b1as DVD/r/RW drive, and recently it started refusing to read data from DVDs, I thought there was something wrong with the setting of the software so I reinstalled Windows 7. But even with Windows 7 freshly installed, it still wouldn't read from a DVD. I wanted to know if this is a hardware failure, so i tried loading a boot CD when the computer booted up. The drive read the boot CD without problems. but the Drive wouldn't read the DVD I put in there. I also looked into •HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE •SYSTEM •CurrentControlSet •Control •Class •{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} and did not find upper and lower filters When a DVD is loaded, I double clicked on DVD/CD RW drive in My Computer, the DVD R/RW ejects and says "Insert a disc, Please insert a Disk to Drive F:" I tried everything I knew how to do (reinstalling Windows 7, Uninstalling the driver and reinstalling it in Windows Device Manager) but I still couldn't fix the problem. I want to be able to use the drive again. I really appreciate your help! 

I have a put a border/frame around a text paragraph, that spans over 3 pages. It is a code sample. The frame has a vertical line at the top of the paragraph on the first page, then 2 vertical lines at the sides of the paragraph also on the first page, and then an unwanted horizontal line inside the paragraph at the end of the 1st page. So, the frame is closed at the end of this page, although the code sample continues on the next. Same procedure at the 2nd page, it starts with the horizontal frame line, although the paragraph has started at the previous page. Using a 1-cell table is not an option either, it also has the unwanted horizontal lines at page ends/beginnings. Is there any option to avoid the closing of the frame at page ends and "reopening" at page beginnings? I only want the vertical lines as long as the paragraph has not ended. 

DGS-1008a is a Fast Ethernet Switch. Fast Ethernet does not have Auto-MDIX, which would swap pins if a crossover cable would be needed where a straight cable is installed, or vice versa. If the other switch also hasn't Auto-MDIX, they cannot connect if the wrong cable is used, or the cable is falsely connected to the sockets in your wall installed in your wall. Your computer very likely has a GBE port. The have become standard years ago. Your computer is therefore able to switch pins if needed. What is the 16port switch? It is a GBE switch, thus it should have Auto-MDIX, but maybe it doesn't. Try a crossover cable between wall socket and DGS switch.
