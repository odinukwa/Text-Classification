Config problems will not go away with a service going away. You will still have to setup you vpn correctly, now including breakout rules for external DNS traffic. 

I came into work last week, checked my first ticket (easy to fix one), RDP'd into the server needed for this and the login did not work. After clicking 'connect' I got the "Unable to Log You on Because of an Account Restriction" message. Checked another server (all machines are 2008R2/2012R2), the same message. No, I do not habe an empty password, not using network auth, my clint is Windows 10 (1607). Here is what I did: 

You can just have a look in the scheduled tasks (and their history). There is no 'show me all remote triggers that point to me' function, as that would be a bit complicated. 

Install or just use the correct ADM(X) template(s) there or on another machine in this Domain. As the Screenshot indicates, this is Windows (Server) 2008, which is not able to edit registry settings like group policy preferences. 

This error occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and system security can no longer be guaranteed. In Short: Someone/Something is killing your LSA. This is less likely to happen, if the executing user has the priviledge of doing so (eg. doing thins right). What can cause this error? 

Sound like a broken AV to me, have a look at the taskmanager (ressources). I would recommend using a frequently flushing (unbuffered) copy tool like . If there are any write problems, robocopy will tell you, if it's read (and cache) problems, it will so, too. 

Any Ideas where to look for this? It is haunting me into my sleep :-( Updates: Surely I checked the local policies on the server(s). any changes would have surprised me - there are a lot of servers. Also checked the clients GPO, nothing. 

No it's not (easily) possible. The guest never knows how it's process threads are executed - that's why we have hypervisors in the first place. 

The command is used to mount NFS based network shares whereas "net use" is used for connecting/disconnecting from a SMB network resource or viewing connection information. Either to use "mount" command or "net use" command would totally depend upon the type of network share that you would be mounting and would not make any difference if the enviroment is load balanced or not. Since 2008, both are capable of mounting NFS shares. But until today cannot view, edit or do anything else with SMB logon-tokens than mount a ressource. 

The problem is, my user(s) can edit and delete files like they have full access. Even if the 'effective permissions' show no right to edit, the still can. The script works fine and looks like this: 

Yes, there are multiple options. From the Scriptin Guys Blog, get the snippet (or function) and try something like this: 

Yes and no. Hyper-V virtual machines (VMs) need to connect to networking via a virtual switch or through Single-Root Input/Output (I/O) Virtualization (SR-IOV). Leveraging InfiniBand connectivity typically means using Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), which currently isn't supported via a virtual switch and therefore isn't available to VMs. The only currently supported use of InfiniBand is RDMA over InfiniBand for SMB traffic and user-mode RDMA over InfiniBand for HPC communications. Outside of these two scenarios, there is no InfiniBand supportâ€”which means no support for VMs. It seems that some network infrastructure vendors are heavily pushing their InfiniBand solutions and claiming to support Hyper-V over InfiniBand, even though Microsoft doesn't support it. In this scenario the IP over InfiniBand (IPoIB) miniport device is used by a Hyper-V virtual switch, to which VMs then connect. However, some organizations I work with have tried this method and have reported problems - sometimes very strange problems that were very hard to hunt down. It's important to remember that RDMA wouldn't be exposed to the VMs via the virtual switch with this method, nor does this approach use SR-IOV to directly map VMs to the InfiniBand card. The only benefit at this point is a very fast connection, which Windows Server 2012R2+ would be able to take advantage of using its virtual Receive Side Scaling (vRSS) feature. But until Microsoft tests and supports this approach, I would be very hesitant to use it. 

Hi everyone i'm having issues with SMTP notifications connecting on port 587 with TLS. Right now I have an internal Exchange 2016 server and all email works great. I have a few customers who have software (mainly backup software) that can have SMTP notifications setup. In order to do this, I need to connect to my SMTP server. If I connect using port 25 all mail and tests seem to work fine. If I tell it to use TLS and port 587, however, the connection never goes through. I've tried going through the default receive connector and making sure my SSL cert is bound to the connection. Ive forwarded 587 on my firewall and verified everything else, but it just won't work. I did notice that in the documentation the default connector on 587 is used for IMAP/POP accounts. In this case its SMTP notifications so I'm not sure if that matters. Its just a backup software with an option to specify SMTP server, port, and login creds. Anyone have any idea of what I could be missing or what could possibly be locking this out? I feel like im misunderstanding something or missing something obvious as everything I've looked into is configured properly. Any help would be greatly appreciated!! 

I'm currently running Server 2012 with I believe Exchange 2013. I have a log server that needs to send email notifications to my email. This is an internal log server so I was going to point it to our internal Exchange server to send those emails out. For authentication i'm using my personal work email so I know the email and password is correct and that no SMTP relay should be needed. The test email doesn't go through, however. What is the best way to track down why the email may be getting rejected? I used the Get-MessageTrackingLog Cmdlet but it doesn't seem to be giving me any good information. I'm assuming I may have a port wrong or something, but I want to see if I can track down a log or something that's telling me why that email may be rejected. I'm using port 587 and set encryption to Allowed, but i'm not sure if that's correct. I know we use SSL/TLS but I believe the logs should tell me if it's the wrong port or if it's being rejected for another reason. Any help at all that could point me in the right direction of troubleshooting this would be greatly appreciated! Thankyou. 

Why type of VPN did you setup? Is it a true site-to-site VPN? First I would test to see if you can communicate at all with the other subnet. For example, when connected to the .30 subnet try pinging any devices on the .31 subnet. If you cannot ping anything then it is a routing issue and you'll need to either set a policy in your firewall/router or configure the VPN to allow that traffic. For example on my Watchguard firewall I am able to connect using a VPN with a different subnet, but in the VPN settings I have it set to allow the use of resources on the main LAN. I have another customer with a site-to-site VPN setup using two Watchguard, but again the policy allows all traffic through so I can ping and access any devices at each location. 

currently I am migrating a Server 2008 32-bit standard server to Windows Server 2012-R2 64 bit. The server is their only server that runs everything. Its for a client who runs a dental office so they have all sorts of shares and fun dental software. The trickiest part is getting software to work etc. but I was wondering if there are any tools or checklists that can help me in this process? For example I was going to do everything manually, by writing down what user roles they have, what software is installed, what network shares are active. I then realized there HAS to be a simpler way, but I'm a newb network admin. Are there any tools to gather information about all the things I'll need to migrate or perhaps a checklist of sorts and I can reference to make sure I have gathered the information? I'm focused on figuring out how i'm going to get their old software including SQL 2005 running so I don't want to miss something simple like a network share or user group. Thankyou very much! 

When an application loads a dynamic link library or executeable without specifying a fully qualified path, Windows tries to locate the binary by searching a well-defined set of directories. This includes the local path, active path and the PATH variable (speaking of applications respecting that, like CMD). If an attacker gains control of one of the directories, like on a website path in IIS, they can force the application to load a malicious copy of the file instead of that it was expecting. These attacks are known as "preloading attacks" and are common to all operating systems that support dynamically loading and/or shared libraries and binaries. The effect of such attacks could be that an attacker can execute code in the context of the user (process) who is running the application. When the application pool is being run as Administrator, this could lead to a local elevation of privilege. This is why a lot of system processes do not use or no longer use the PATH contents to search for their binaries. More on this: Secure loading of libraries to prevent preloading attacks 

There is no (easy) auditing itself (except audit logs), but you can use to check regularly (usage here). 

The solution in my case was the option "Restrict delegation of Credentials to remote Servers". Basically, there is a new Group policy settings that can prevent a system to pass credentials to a remote server. This was exactly the issue. you can find this setting in your lokal oder domain group policy under: 

Your description read exactly like this KB: "Poor network performance on virtual machines on a Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V host if VMQ is enabled". VMQ must be disabled for your adapters. If that is not working, check the eventlog why. 

Increase scheduling priority This policy setting determines which user accounts can increase the base priority class of a process. It is not a privileged operation to increase relative priority within a priority class. Specifically, this security setting determines which accounts can use a process with Write Property access to another process to increase the run priority that is assigned to the other process. A user with this privilege can still change the scheduling priority of a process through the Task Manager user interface. Or shorter: A User can do with his User Process whatever he wants. 

I would recommend a (Hard-)RAID0/1 on this for better performance and availability. But this configuration will be slow anyway - get all the cache and BB you can find on the controller (nearly all DL3xx are capable of BBWC/BBFC). 

Interesting phenomenon. Here is what I would try - I have no idea if this really helps. If it was my machine, I would extensively watch the SMB perfcounters. One of them will show the cause. More things to try Add more Worker Threads In case the SMB_RDR obens up one write I/O Request per line (what should not happen here), it may help to add some threads to the execution engine. Set "AdditionalCriticalWorkerThreads" to 2, then to 4. 

The complete answer is somewhat complex and layed out here: $URL$ tl;dr AnyConnect is bulls*t, it messes with the local routing table. Use other VPN-Client software to create the tunnel. For example try Shrew to import the cisco profile and connect to your endpoint. Works perfect for me and is a lot more stable. 

Are you sure that's not the sever's authentication certificate display? This certificate makes sure, the server you are sending your credentials to is the server (or gateway or broker service) you connected to in the first place (judging by it's name [CN] on the certificate). 

Note that in the command to save the permissions there is no slash. Here you can read why this is important. 

Yes, thats the default behaviour. For any IP address - the 'name' field is dynamically filled by the client. 

Thats right. Teaming distributes the TCP traffic over multiple interfaces (which do have multiple mac addresses), but that's done in the driver, not the IP-Stack. You application won't know about, like you vm doesn't.
