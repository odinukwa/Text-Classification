Your mail server should retry when mail delivery is deferred. Do use a less aggressive retry policy such as after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours before failing. You could also retry after 2 and 4 days. If the newsletters are time sensitive you may want an even shorter retry period. You are unlikely to get penalized for retrying after a temporary failure, such as mailbox full. You may be penalized for and aggressive retry policy. I've seen servers retry several times a minute until they succeed. Some organizations will pass temporary failures to a second server dedicated to handling retries. If you do this, don't continue passing it to different servers. If you send out mailings more than once a month, consider temporarily suspending addresses that bounce from the retry server. Tacking how long an address is bouncing due to long term temporary failures (delivery success rate). Consider dropping addresses that have failed for a few months. You will accumulate dead addresses as not all organizations will bounce dead addresses. Consider sending messages asking the users to opt-in again every year or so. While you may not want to drop users immediately, you may want to drop them if they haven't responded for two or more years. EDIT: Overquota/mailbox full is not the only reason you will get messages deferred. You should retry all deferrals on a reasonable schedule as listed above. The server will defer connections if it is to busy. Greylists will defer messages from new servers that don't are not whitelisted. My server also defers messages from servers that fail various policy checks: SPF, rDNS (IP address), rDNS (HELO/EHLO if not matching IP address) etc. My greylisting is per network block, but my policy listing is done by server. My policy list would apply to Microsoft controlled services if they weren't whitelisted. Otherwise my policy lists have been catching spam bots, and junk mailers. 

Dovecot makes no assumption that you want to enable access for system users. This allows it to provide an environment where only virtual users have access. It appears you have only configured virtual users. You can combine multiple user and password databases. I use an additional password database to provide users with e-mail only passwords for from cyber-cafes and other remote locations. You have made no provisions for logging in with system (NIS) users. Try adding a specification using the passwd driver. Something like this should work. 

From your responses it looks like you want to rewrite the sender. A quick search for found a fair bit of documentation. It looks like you want to add a line to . Something like this: 

Your SPF policy is extremely open, so anyone is allowed to send for your domain. (This will happen anyway because you include the Google policy.) Other than the above issues, I would not expect your use of a Gmail address in the header to cause your email to be classified as Spam. The published Gmail SPF policy would allow this use. It is likely you will need to get your IP address provider to update your record. EDIT: The field is intended for cases where someone (an assistant) is sending email on behalf of someone else (the address). In this case the and envelope addresses should be the same and the address different. The field is indented for cases where replies should go to a different address than the address sending the email. There may be rare cases where it is appropriate to all three fields with different values for each. Either the and semantics apply for many web-sites, but in most case the code is the message author, so it should be the address. Sites that allow users to send other links or other information would then put the originating user's address in the address. Responses to such email are likely not of interest to the site, so use a address which is sent to the bit bucket. You may want to track volumes and reasons. You should have active and addresses so you can be notified of abuse and configuration issues. 

Try configuring PHP to connect directly to your mail relay. For your use I don't believe you need a mail server. You will need to install the package and configure it to use SMTP. Make sure the domain you are sending mail from has an MX record. If the domain has an SPF record, make sure your mail relay is allowed to send mail on its behalf. Any of the light weight relay only servers like eSMTP, mSMTP or sSMTP should be sufficient for your needs. 

The file should handle the problem. This is a standard part of the Exim distribution. You will need to configure one record for each local user sending email. Try a line to like: 

This ignores all the directory under . Directories named or are also ignored. I am not sure you can use wildcards when listing directories. If you have multiple workpress caches under you may want to try . Adjust to your needs. 

It looks like they downgraded security in their upgrade. TLS security appears not to work. This may be the result of a patch on your side checking defaulting to or verifying TLS security. You should be able to identify the security being used in the browser after you have fetched a page. I would try contacting hostmaster@someserver.xxx, as they probably don't intend to be non-compliant with TLS security. If VBScript is using the Internet Explorer setting, you could try disabling all TLS ciphers in IE. This should force VBScript to negotiate to an SSLv3 or SSLv2 cipher. I would start with disabling 3DES as there was(is) a Windows problems when connecting to servers using a secure implementation. 

This answer is generic, rather than specific to Mailjet. I am not familiar with that particular software, but I am all to familiar with being on the receiving side of automated deliveries. The first thing I would to is ensure your rDNS validates and your mail server identifies itself with that domain name. Also make sure your mail server accepts messages to , , and the envelope address you are using. I would expect you are paying the cost of a higher delivery rate. Given the time taken without the SMTP server, I would expect you had a number of failed deliveries to servers which avoid accepting SPAM. Some of the problems you would encounter sending my server mail: 

It appears from your message that you may be an administrator. If so, you have the rights because at times you will need them. Accept, but don't abuse the privilege granted you. A trustworthy administrator will only use the rights when required to do your duties. Those duties may include scanning emails for specific content, tracing email sources, and other activities which require access to other user's email. If you are making someone an administrator, consider the following. Anyone with administrative rights more or less has the keys to the kingdom. If you can't trust them, don't make them administrators. They should be in a position to undo pretty well anything you do to remove access. I would expect that most solutions would be best implemented by the administrator. The mail server would need to be able to decrypt the mailboxes. This would give the administrator access to the mailboxes. Encrypting the mail messages at both ends could be done. However, this would severely limit who you can exchange email with. It is likely that you would want the administrator to be able to install and debug the encryption software. The administrator is likely to be in a position to access the mail by packet capture as well. This is more difficult, but not extremely difficult. A trustworthy administrator will not abuse their authority. Where they do need to access mail folders, they will limit their access as much as possible.
