As mentioned, this configuration was working until recently. If I look at the Windows Firewall Security Logging, I can see that the TCP SYN packets from my client to this server's port 21 are being dropped. How should I configure Windows Firewall to allow the packets? One solution that works is to use the "Advanced" tab -> "Local Area Connection" settings and enable "FTP Server", but the dialog box states that opens the exception for Internet access. I am looking for a solution that allows access for only the local subnet. 

First, try to figure out what happened on the date in question. Did your system install an update? Did you change the configuration of some other security related application, such as an Anti-Virus or Anti-Spyware application? Did something change your network configuration? Did you install a VPN or SSL-VPN client which may have affected your systems internal routing tables? If you can figure out what changed, try and see if you can undo the change. Just be warned, undoing may not be possible for a variety of reasons. For the case that raised this question, it a change to the anti-spyware application coincided with the break in FTP service, but it was not possible to restore functionality by restoring the anti-spyware application configuration. One solution is, on the Windows Firewall Exceptions tab, create an exception for Port 21 TCP and then scope the exception for "My network (subnet) only. Essentially, one is duplicating the functionality from the "Advanced Tab", but the Exceptions tab allows for the limit of scope. This exception allows one to delete the "FileZilla" application exception and still permit access to the ftp server. The File Transfer Program exception is a red herring - that entry allows the ftp client on the server to access ftp servers on other hosts. The next time one tries to use the ftp client, Windows Firewall will pop-up a dialog box to create the exception, assuming a default configuration of Windows Firewall. 

because I have a second file in that location, but GRUB responded with the same error. I also tried: 

While I haven't tried to configure an Exchange Server to allow ActiveSync connections, I have used Nokia devices and Mail For Exchange to sync email, calendar, and contacts to my device. I would direct you to the Mail For Exchange Manuals, if you don't already have them. I would also suggest trying the connection from a WiFi node inside your firewall, with a network sniffer attached to the line. Basically, simplify the network arrangement so that you can focus on the application configuration. 

Given the budget concerns, I would suggest "Last Season's Model" of server from the likes of Dell or HP. By watching the various dealsite RSS feeds for "Small Business" related feeds, I have found that these standard servers cost less than roughly equivalent servers I have built myself, and they require a lot less time to install. My only complaint with the stock servers is the fan noise, which in a few, very limited situations, has been a problem. Also, waiting for a manufacturer's special can be annoying, but sometimes one has more time than budget. Farseeker's suggestions for App servers seem pretty good. 

The Nokia E series will full keyboards are very nice. There is a solid SSH client for Symbian 3rd edition. Your organization will need to purchase Mail For Exchange from Microsoft in order to sync the phone with your Exchange server. Mail For Exchange is a solid product - solid enough that Nokia dropped its own product in favor of supporting Mail For Exchange. 

Compare Problem Stat to a Known Good State and look for the discrepancies. A Known Good State can be an actual documented state. It can also be based on a standard of expected behavior, such as known expected behavior of networking protocols or such as rules of thumb about appropriate average CPU usage. Examples: Using Wireshark or other network sniffer tool, you repeatedly see duplicate packets. Now you can delve in to try an figure out why you are seeing the same IP packet on the wire. Perhaps you have a "local router" scenario, or perhaps something is fragmenting IP packets. Average CPU usage is at 90%. If the average is 90%, then the server is likely maxing out CPU frequently, causing everything to back up. 

Chopper3's suggestion of using Time Machine is solid. It's a pretty cool Mac thing that Mac people will probably like. You don't need to purchase an Apple Time Capsule - FreeNAS can handle it: 

I use network sniffers to troubleshoot these kinds of problems. The firewall is a likely culprit, so analyzing the network traffic on the outside and inside of the firewall can reveal what specifically is going wrong with the FTP connection. One thing to check on the firewall policy is that the non-standard port is actually configured to handle FTP traffic. It seems that the policy has been configured to enable a TCP connection to the non-standard port. Has the policy been configured to allow specifically FTP traffic? If you are using a very low-end firewall that can only perform NAT and basic packet inspection (i.e., not a TCP state aware firewall), then you will need to configure the FTP server to only allow passive mode, configure the FTP server to only allow DATA connections on some small range of ports (10 or 20?), and then configure the firewall to allow inbound connections to the FTP server for those 10-20 ports. 

A common technique from the past was to restore a backup from the Production server on to a machine in a lab environment. From there, the configuration can be altered to meet the needs of the new networking environment. 

You could try scripting rsync ($URL$ to run in some kind of "pushbutton" way: As soon as you edit or create a file on the Windows machine, push the button, and away it goes. You could also create a script (batch or Powershell) that sleeps for some period of time in between rsync runs. I suggest rsync, because my understanding is that the protocol is more efficient (data / protocol overhead) than either CIFS or NFS. 

How can I test passwords against a dictionary / word list, where the entries have been fuzzed to some degree? By "fuzzed", I mean variants of words with "l33t" conversions and other character conversions are included in the check. Ideally, I would like to pass in a password value, have the utility check the password, and return a yes/no value. 

and that worked What I would really like is a way to have GRUB call syslinux/isolinux bootloader. Then syslinux could load its own menu and whatnot. Anyone know how to do this? 

I have been managing Debian, and now Ubuntu, desktop systems for a small shop for several years now. I am very comfortable with apt for package management and distribution upgrades. The Ubuntu installer has worked for every system I have needed to add. I have not touched Red Hat for many years and have never really managed any RHEL systems. I have an opportunity to take over a RHEL and CentOS shop. I am looking for a list of issues / management concerns specific to rolling out RHEL and CentOS as desktop environments for multiple users who have a mix of Dell desktop and laptop systems. What issues should I watch for when rolling out CentOS as a desktop environment? 

I've been catching up on my security podcast backlog, and I've been hearing about cloudburst attacks on virtual machines. While Google returns info about the Black Hat related press releases, I can't find info about how to defend against this attack. How does one defend against the cloudburst, and similar, attacks? 

Use wireshark $URL$ and a host outside the firewall to see what ports are used by this particular FTP+SSL configuration. Based on the traffic you see, create firewall rules to allow that kind of traffic from the IP address of FTP server. 

I have enjoyed the Security Now podcast ($URL$ which, over the years, has covered many aspects of the TCP/IP family of protocols. Once you have learned the theory, nothing beats installing a protocol analyzer, such as wireshark ($URL$ and getting some hands on. 

Nikb's suggestion is sound. One additional area of consideration: How much RAM (or CPU cores, or disk systems) can an instance of your application / application architexture access? I saw a situation where an application on a quadcore server with 14GB of RAM ran very slowly even though CPU usage was less than 25% and RAM usage was low. It turned out that application engine could only access 1.5GB of RAM. The application instance was maxed out, even though the machine was only lightly affected. 

If you can get an pcap of valid OpenVPN Client to OpenVPN server interaction, you could model the initial set of packets with something like netcat, as suggested by TiZon. Basically, you want enough of a valid first packet to get the server to respond with at least an error message, so it doesn't have to be perfect, just good enough. I tried going to $URL$ but I didn't see an OpenVPN example there. Perhaps, if someone else is claiming the service is up, you could get that other person to grab a pcap of the transaction. 

I connected the Ubuntu 9.10 vpnc to a cisco VPN device by first: 1) Installing the Cisco VPN client for a Window's host (Win XP) in my case, installing the config file provided by the network/security administrator, and having it working on Windows 2) Comparing the needed Network Connections -> VPN options with various screens of the Window's client. I did not try to compile the Cisco Linux client - I used the built-in vpnc with Ubuntu and Ubuntu 9.10's standard network configuration. For our network configuration, it took about 15 minutes per box (on the windows side, the client installation took the most time. On the Ubuntu side, the cross comparison took the most time. 

While I agree with the sentiment that curl/wget and scripting can get the job done well, if you are really looking for another way, consider penetration testing tools. Especially if you need to interact with the site, for example to log in to the site, these tools will allow you to automate your testing. Of course, you will still need to do a little work to configure/script the tool to do what you need. 

You could use a tool like Magical Jelly Bean Key Finder ($URL$ to confirm what license key is registered by your system. If you installed and used a license key which is now invalid, Microsoft does provide license key update utilities. I have used the utility for Windows XP. 

I would suggest running wireshark or tcpdump, filtered first to the IP address, and for later captures the MAC address of client system. 

I am certain that the Check Point knowledgebase has this answer, although for the life of me I can't remember what to do. Two general things to try: 

Depending on your size of organization, you can establish a set of "Key Users" in the user population. These users have the responsibility of aggregating and prioritizing change requests for a particular application or function. They represent The Users, a key IT stakeholder, in business discussions about allocating IT resources. Most likely, Management and The IT Organization are already represented in these discussions, but The Users are not directly represented. In the process of aggregating userbase input into the IT business decisions, these individuals become seen as local experts and go-to people in their parts of the organization. They are explicitly aggregators of issue reports and serve both to focus problem reports into IT as well as to disseminate information from IT. The benefit for the organization is that a key stakeholder gets an explicit voice in IT related business decisions. The benefit for the IT group is that they have fewer points of contact that need to be actively managed. The benefit for management is that the organization is communicating more effectively. 

First, check the Check Point knowledgebase. In the past, the answer was no, but there may have been a product enhancement. There are tools / procedures for recovering a policy from a firewall and making it available for management on the Management Server. These tools were developed by various support organizations to help customers who had suffered a catastrophic loss of the Management Server and related back-ups. The procedures are somewhat involved and can be a little tricky. Again, this information would only be available from your support organization. 

I am using a Centos 5.5 box. Something on the network is advertising IPv6 prefixes, and I want to know who. One solution would be to install tcpdump or tshark and just look at the network traffic. I would prefer not to have to rewire the network or play rpm sherpa with scp. Is there a utility, like or that will show me the addresses of the routers sending the advertisements? 

This does not seem to be a zsh issue. This is an issue with the specific implementation of the command stty on your system. To investigate a new command, remember: 

An idea, not really a solution: Try L2TP or a 4in4 tunneling protocol (GRE?), and then run that over IPv6. It seems to me that most of the 6in4 tunneling issues was more about setting up manageable routing and less about the protocol specification of the tunnel. The "protocol" in "protocol" encapsulation seems to be done pretty much the same way, it was always the management piece or the gui configuration piece that tripped people up. 

As others have mentioned, you need to have a Recovery Plan, not just a backup plan. You need to verify periodically that you can restore a system from your current backups. You need to know how long it will take. 

In my experience, you sometimes get lucky by trying some obvious things first, but once you exhaust the truly quick fixes, you need to get methodical quickly. This method is compatible with Scientific Method and Test One Thing At A Time. 

I would consider this a bad solution - too convoluted. You will want to service contract in order to get security updates for your router and to get access to the Cisco Support Site. If the Cisco device is just too expensive, consider a lower cost alternative, either from a different vendor or "Roll-Your-Own". Just remember RFC 1925 truth #3 

I'm going to keep trying, but I would welcome any advice on how to get Ubuntu 10.10 installed on my headless server. 

I generally prefer file synchronization to normal backups for user files, because even when I was at the office without my laptop, I could still look at my files, for example, from someone else's machine or from a "burnbox" computer. Very convenient. Look at rsync For your consideration, there are two areas of backup you need to plan for: 

Use this as an opportunity to test your backup/restore plan. Use your regular backups and restore to a testing machine, either in an isolated network or on a virtual machine surrounded by a virtual network. Be sure to time how long it takes you to restore a working system - you will need that information for calculating downtime in the event of a complete failure. Also, be sure to note how much and what kind of data was entered since the most recent backup. 

The general security answer is that some information, for example shared secret or other key, must be exchanged "out of band". That information is then used to encrypt the connection between the end-points and also to provide some degree of authentication. If everything passes over a particular connection, then neither end-point can be confident in any aspect of the connection, as either or both end-points can be spoofed by a man-in-the-middle. Even for some seemingly in band connections, like SSL connections, there is information being exchanged outside the SSL connection - the certificates for CAs (Certificate Authorities) are packaged with your browser when you install it, out of band of the eventually SSL connection between you and your bank (hopefully). As for the usual security discussions, I think the implicit assumption is opposite of the described "once it gets out of your building[or network segment or host machine], it's secure". Once the data is out of your building, you have no control over it, and the data and connection are implicitly insecure. That's why you create VPNs between buildings - so that if an attacker tampers with the connection, you might have a chance of knowing it. Perhaps what you have noticed about end-point security discussions is that an attacker has an easier time attacking a specific target if the attacker is near one of the end-points. Once a connection is multiplexed into the Telco's core network, it can be difficult to distinguish one connection from another. Perhaps what you have noticed about end-point security discussions is that many companies do less to security their local networks than the ISP does to secure its data center, and therefore the end-point is easier to attack. If you really want to delve into the paranoia of securing network connections, take a look at the military's Rainbow Series of books/reports on security (superceeded by the Common Criteria for Evaluation and Validation, and Rainbow Series is a catchier nickname). 

Zoredache comment about sniffer is, I think, the gold standard. Another options: use the command to see if the number of transmitted and received packets on the interface is increasing. Also, can see if any other interfaces are being used. For shell scripts, you may be able to query the proc data structures directly. 

I have subscribed to the "Sherlock Holmes" method of troubleshooting, aka Binary Search Troubleshooting Method:
