I believe this will answer your question: $URL$ In short, windows permissions vary based on whether the target is a folder or a file. The tables in this explain it in detail. The information is dated but for the most part this should still be intact. This is a bit more up to date and applies now but a bit more complicated. $URL$ 

data 52e is the key, this means that the AD server is saying 'Invalid Credentials.'. I'm not readily familiar with JXplorer so I'm not sure how you set the credential for the session, but something is going awry there. 

Pardon, because I'm not super experienced with various Linux distros, but from the Active Directory side, this sounds like you may have a problem with your RID Master. If the pool is depleted and not being replenished, it may be that the other domain controllers cannot communicate with it for some reason. What happens under the hood is the RID master allocates a pool of (i think) 500 RIDs at a time for new objects, and when that gets to less than half a new request is made and a new block of RIDs is assigned. I would recommend trying a full dcdiag and looking through it for any errors (or asking your AD admin to do so) as a starting measure. 

Using port 200 would definitely be an issue. My users wouldn't be able to see your site on that port. 8443 is a good compromise. Being standard in Java environments, more professional environments will allow it. I suspect there will still be issues, however. 

Depending on how you are configuring your datasource, you may be able to specify a setting like . If were set to 5 minutes, set to 4. The only two timeout values that can be specified for MySQL connections are wait_timeout and interactive_timeout. could potentially apply to named pipes too, if it connected as a client would. If I recall correctly if neither wait_timeout or interactive_timeout are specified, the default is 28800. 

I would suggest creating a spreadsheet listing the key responsibilities within your department. This could be more general and identify specific areas that have more support associated with them, such as the phone system or ticket system. Have staff assigned as primary and secondary, so as that the immediate knowledge can be shared in addition to the documentation. This will clarify responsibilities and they can be moved around to prevent boredom as well as enable learning within the group. Some example categories for the responsibility matrix would be: 

Is the Windows 10 system part of a domain? When you load this module by default, it attempts to look at your service records, find an efficiently located domain controller and map it to the PSDrive "AD:\" so that you can navigate it within powershell and review records. It is possible to disable this: $URL$ 

You could install a second NIC and multi-home the server if the software will support it. The risk to your AD domain depends on whether the credentials are used to log in to that server. If so, they are at risk and you probably want to manage it with an account that only has permissions to that box. Yes, someone owning it could be a further risk if you don't notice it, but as long as you're not logging into it with domain admins and the like, it wouldn't necessarily immediately compromise the whole domain. Long run though, it would be best to get the extra network gear and configure a DMZ and separate it from your internal network and open only absolutely required ports back to AD or anything else internal. 

is the userland tool for manipulating netfilter. netfilter is the code in the kernel that handles the packet filtering. Contextually, changing the userland tool would only change your experience not the way the filtering operates. I have never hit a limitation in Linux with the quantity of rules specified and I've been using Linux for firewalling since the userland tool was . It's notable that Netfilter wasn't introduced to Linux until the 2.4.x kernel and was the interface for ipfw not netfilter. OpenBSD is great for a firewall if you can continue using it in your environment. The limitation will likely be a physical limitation based on the system resources, with a focus on the quantity of RAM available. If you encounter issues, you may have to tune Linux's max ip connection settings in the kernel. You're unlikely to encounter either of these situations on modern hardware with a modern Linux distribution. If you would like to discuss the finer details of netfilter, you might be better off furthering this dialog on the netfilter mailing lists, as they will be the subject matter experts. If this does not answer your question, please feel free to clarify and I will be happy to revise it. Netfilter user hits memory limitation testing netfilter limits 

Not sure if this answers your question because there's not a lot of detail but this is just asking you how you'd like to configure this new domain controller. Do you want it to be a DNS server? Do you want it to be a Global Catalog? I'm guessing the plan is not to have an RODC since you already have one there, but those are recommended if the site does not have a secure computer closet or data center. You only have to have the DNS service on one domain controller technically, but in all honesty with most scenarios I set them up as both a DNS server AND as a Global Catalog. DNS for the local site if there are enough users, and Global Catalog so it can answer queries through 3268/3269 TCP (GC queries). The GC is a read-only port that returns partial data for your entire forest, if you have a multi-domain environment this is especially useful. Old documentation says you should only use it as you need to, but this was based on slow connections in days gone by, these days with reliable network speeds that's usually a non-issue. 

I would treat it largely the same as I would any other interview process, with slight variation depending upon the exact situation. Emphasis on the phone screen. Write a job description with the key qualifications and then write a phone interview script based on verification of the desired qualifications. Find several potential candidates. If you are more serious, schedule interviews over a week, and travel to the remote office and conduct interviews. If not, conduct the interview process via the phone and maybe have someone in the local office do a HR style interview. If you are not looking to hire full time staff, you might have better luck locating a reputable local IT firm and hiring them as a consultant. If they do not meet your Utah staff's and your expectations, it should be quite clear and then hire a competitor. For a general search: I would focus on local resources such as Craigslist, usergroups, and other professional organizations with presence in the local community. If you have professional resources in your network, seek them out for recommendations in that market. 

I think you might be looking for 'erroractionpreference', this article explains through a few examples of how it works. $URL$ Given the other answer, if your script is larger than this function and you need to continue troubleshooting, then you'd need to wrap this bit of code by setting it at the beginning and setting it back to 'continue' after you are done processing. This will suppress non-terminating errors like that so they are not printed to your host. 

Your best solution to this problem is absolutely a conditional forwarder, although as someone pointed out above a delegation would probably work as well if your DC can route to it. Of course, if it can't you'd have bigger problems. Otherwise, just typical split-brain DNS scenario where you're answering most clients for what you have, but anything specifically to www.contoso.com you can forward to this other server. With the contoso.com it gets a wee bit hairier for kind for the same reason the other commenter mentioned. Your AD domain is using this. If your domain were instead a subdomain such as 'ad.contoso.com' you could also simply use a CF here. That, of course, assumes your dept1/dept examples are correct and not like dept1.ad.contoso.com If your servers are at least 2012 R2 I believe there is a new functionality for this: $URL$ Hope this helps. 

Now, the service created is using Srvany.exe, which is part of the Windows Resource Kit. This enables you to define a service with your software that otherwise would not support it. After that, you will need to use RegEdit to create a "Parameters" key for your service under . Within that key, you will want to create a string value called "Application" and enter the full path to your batch file that you want to run as a service. Microsoft has instructions for this as well using a different method to create the service initially. 

In the context of generic data center services, a cross connect typically refers to the patched connectivity between the data center's facilities and the line of demarcation into the building. It would often be the patched connection between your servers and the Internet access or any additional network connectivity.
