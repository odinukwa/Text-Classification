If you have another computer with Windows Xp not virtualized, try to install there the image via Alchool 120%. If you do not have another computer with Windows Xp you may install also Alchool 120% and mount the image in 

So you can iterate with a for cycle and download each single url generated. Here below a script example and after a one line command. 

The command , without further specifications, will wait for the end of the all the active child processes. It means if there were another process too it will wait the end of the last that will finish. Wait can be called specifying an ID: with ID is possible to pass or the PID (process ID) or the job specification. Moreover, if it was not a single command but a pipe, will wait the end of the full pipeline (See below). So with it will wait the end of the process with ID 7165, with of the job . In a script you can store the PID of the last job sent using the variable ; you need to store that value because it will be updated after each command execution. 

In the imagemagick package there is a program called that will overwrite the original image file, and another, , that will write to a different image file. In Linux there is another command, , that will search (and find) all the files in a path that will fullfill the search criteria and that can execute some command with the filename found. 

An old way to do it is with plotutils [1] installed. (under Ubuntu you can install with ). With the command 

The character at the beginning of the filename makes it hidden. To see an hidden file from shell you can do (or ). Note the differences: 

Note again the double quote for just in case you have spaces in the string of directory. The double are not really needed for since you know that, in this case, is . [1] You can put directly instead of and avoid to write all the lines with Cname in the script. 

ps> It is possible that when updated external third parties programs firefox will not prompt for restarting, even if it should be recommended. 

[if you are interested continue to read here or with ]. Specific to your problem If your problem depends on one of the aspects above you can try to write in only one line more than one command, and after quick recall them with the up arrow key, e.g.: 

(or ) is an internal command of all the shells (all, starting from ). Under and it will set the variable , for the present and old working directory. Under and it will set instead and . So with the command in bash or in tcsh you will be brought to the old working directory if it exists, or to your home directory if this variable is not set. The exit code will be always , if you have access to your home directory(1). 

I will write down some hints and direction to search for, in the following TL;DR section. Microsoft In the office pages [1,2] about "Remove hidden data and personal information..." and "Inspect documents for hidden data and personal information" is reported that a many kind of personal data can be included inside an Office document (and it is reported a way to remove them): 

Note that you may want to decide with which definition to have the final document: in the above case I choose A4 format 300 dpi. Below a table to remember those dimensions in pixel for each definition of oint Per Inches, PPI. 

A bash subshell will inherit the variables of the parent shell (but it will not modify them!). A simple way is to define you series of command with variables that you define and modify them in the parent shell. 

Short answer: The most simple thing to do is probably to install on the laptops something like a dynamic DNS update client to keep track of their dynamic IP address when they are not in your Local Network. Some words more: The problem is that with only the MAC address you are forced to scan a subnet to find an answering machine with that MAC address once you call it's IP address. Other side of the problem is that this IP change each time the remote machine connects to a provider (or the ADSL reset the connection and assign a different IP address). It's most simple if that machine (the laptop) communicates somehow the current IP. A way to do it to use a dynamic DNS update client. It exist even a Linux daemon ddclient that help with [dynamic ip servers].($URL$ After that you choose your name (e.g 'myname.AtFreeOrCommercialProvider.org') and enable on the laptop a program to update the IP, it will be enough to do write from the office the above line to know the current IP of the remote machine: 

I can suggest you to give a look to Wget for windows or, if the remote server will allow you, even to rsync for windows or the rsync windows backup agent. Some notes on Wget: 

More words : The one you are using is more a feature of NTFS file system. From one of the microsoft page about it 

CPU usage: cumulative vs average value. A modern CPU has multiple cores. If you have a process that is using intensively 3 cores it can be reported to use "300% of CPU usage", its cumulative value, as well as that value divided by the number of cores. Sometimes it is more useful the first, some other the second. Often it is possible to choose as option. Under KDE, when you press Ctrl-Esc, it starts the System Activity [1] 

Stopping the cursor over one of the CPU values shown, you will see a mask with some information more. 

Then you can start to divide your script until you find the error (or you can write in some points lines as ..., execute it and read the last Here I Am #). 

Coreutils solutions [1] When coreutils are present on your system and you have no need to save the time and the resources to call an external program, and and are both perfect ways to reach your goal. The use of is straightforward. Eventually you can consider to use also the option to send an additional kill signal if the first fails. 

Reading your comment I think you can create a temporary file and destroy it as you exit from evince. 

Update (Bash is great): with recent versions of Bash it is possible to fix this dangerous behaviour with the following command that I suggest to put in file: 

Last comment If you nest 3 loop (one inside the other) you'll obtain each permutation: not 3 but 3*3*3=27 lines 

If you have enough space on your local disk and your goal is to minimise the amount of date sent over the network maybe it is enough to enable the compression with scp or rsync : 

Some words more If you are annoyed by this output you may consider to read the OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section of the man and the option specifications: 

I can add that you can call with dash as the last parameter to stay in the interactive regime when the script completes. 

Alt+. If you need only to repeat the last part of one of the previous commands you can use Alt+. that will paste the last argument taken from the last line of the history. If pressed more than one time will substitute what just pasted with the last argument of the line before... E.g. if the last 2 commands were: 

It depends from what you mean for . Sadly you cannot simply them outside of your script. From the on you can read. 

Note: you can monitor the temperature with or you can start to parse its output (or the one) with a script (with or without the command), adding colours, logging the output into a file... 

but changing the options you can search for the files, directories, symbolic and hard links ... Of course this method uses more CPU and disk accesses then the dedicated kernel patches reported above, but if you have to search for it only one time this is a better solution, especially if you do not start to search from the root . Last but not least you can try to identify a file type with the command , e.g. , with the list of signature (or magic numbers ), or with the List of filename extensions. Once you know the filetype you can guess the program that have created or modified a file among the ones you have installed on that computer... and start to monitor them. 

Then if you need a different format you can convert it or you can rewrite the script. Note that some commands know if their output is piped or not. For example, may change its output if piped. 

See the rendering with different fonts on the this wiki page. This font however, contains only the complete unaccented Greek alphabet. So it can happens when in a document there is a mix of different fonts and charsets that in the translation something goes lost and you end up with an hybrid representation. Further references 

We can add some opensource program for dealing with images as gimp or imagemagick. The first, GIMP is the GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed piece of software for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring. Something like Photoshop but opensource. Huge program: you can use e.g. to create a pdf from scanned images. The second, Imagemagick is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of formats (over 100) including DPX, EXR, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. With the second it's possible to convert in pdf using expressly the option specifying the geometry and size: 

find is another tool you can find in your shell under windows as well as a compiled executable(gnu findutils)... The following line works under Linux but you can modify the statement to be compliant with your system specifications. From another answer... 

In the first line I deleted the string 'is uptodate' with sed to have a more clean output. This open the problem if you have a file named 'is uptodate' of course :-) It has to be handled in a different way... 

Copy the cell with the formula with ctrl+C Use paste special with ctrl+shitf+V. In the windows that will open check only 

Trivial To be noted from that in the definition of PWD is used current working directory(cwd) and not something like present working directory (PWD)... 

Explanations: as usual when you send a command in the background with , its PID is stored into the internal variable (present in the modern version of , , , , ...). What really makes the difference among the shells is the presence of the built-in command [2] and of the option . In the 1st version if the user will not complete a line of input before the specified amount of seconds the instruction will be terminated and an error return code will be generated. 

You can put this alias with the other of your configuration shell (typically in or ) and use when you want. Problem is that those are blind, they will not see the actual situation of your shell. A better solution Just to make all this independent from your knowledge of those variable values, and a little bit more complex, you can create a function () to create an alias () to go back, whatever was the initial situation. 

Without modifying the current shell setting it's possible to execute each of the Cyrus proposal in a subshell 

You can do it in different ways. A little script will help. You can call it with . The destination directory is an optional: 

It seems a work for . It allows somehow the use of associative multidimensional arrays. The following bash script should do the work. 

In case of multiple answers you can process each single entry... for example using awk to build your command and piping the output to a bash shell. 

What it misses is the sub-model [5]: for example the Toshiba Satellite L350-00J holds up to 4 GB instead the L350-ST3702 holds up to 8 GB. On that site are reported more then 3 pages of sub-codes this is not something that we can do for you... ... but it is even reported [6] that you can find your full model number... flipping it! 

Many times when I upgrade the system under Linux, firefox pops up a window suggesting to restart the program in order to make effective all the changes. When I ignore that windows because of an urgent duty in a second time I'm not able to find it again. Of course I know it's always possible to exit and restart it manually; in Linux to kill the process with , with or without a brutal . In a similar way in Windows it is possible to use the Task Manager... What I was searching for is an internal solution, a clean one, possibly system independent. How to force to restart firefox in a clean way ? 

If you want to connect to one of this computer from your MAC you can do, for example, via when you know the IP of the machine, you are on the same LAN, there is sshd (a deamon that accepts ssh connection) up on the receiving machine (the Linux one). From outside this network can be a little more complicated and lan dependent; usually you connect to the gateway and from here you connect to the specific computer. Else you can join to the VPN if there is one, and from that moment is like if you were connected with a cable locally... 

It there is no special reason to do in the way you used, you can directly create a tarred gzipped file with 

Under a Linux shell with the command , or simply if sbin is in your PATH, you can read those parameters. To know if a LAN allow other computer to be connected with you can 

Divide in sub-problem In general when you cannot find a fast complete solution to your problem you can divide it in sub-problems more easy to be solved. 

In your case probably you turn off the computer before it ends to physically copy the files. Unfortunately the simple answer is not enough to guarantee that the kernel finished to flush them. Moreover if your HDD was completely full some part of the files should still be only on the memory; thus, after the system reboot, there is no way to extract again them from the ram. Next time you can try to avoid this problem giving a command before to turn off and waiting its exit status: 

Inside your script you can use the array as normal variable. Instead of you have to refer to them with something like or ... Note that you need to put to protect them. 

You can find something interesting e.g. in Art of Assembly: Chapter Thirteen Following 13.2.5 INT 13h - Low Level Disk Services you can think to use 

In case on of the rsync (client-server) is not enough modern you have to use more and more effort. Indeed you can use , , increasing each time in verbosity, but the parsing will be more complex. 

it is always the current shell that is waiting for all the childs output. A single Ctrl+C will end this waiting for all together. If instead you will wait the end of the script, the current shell will try to execute their output as they will finish. 

You may want to create the temp file in special directory that cannot be read by other users and maybe under the or another one that will be erased on the next reboot.
