Try changing the connection string to the one below, and see if that helps any: Data Source=MYSERVERNAME;Initial Catalog=DATABASENAME;Integrated Security=True 

I'm trying to plan a SQL Server 2008 R2 2 node Active/Passive failover cluster. Is it possible to set up multiple named instances running on the cluster? e.g. sqlcluster sqlcluster\demo sqlcluster\dev And could demo and dev share the same SAN LUN? Thanks, Kenny 

You could double check if Anonymous Authentication is enabled for the default web site, and the other authentication types (e.g. forms) are disabled?: $URL$ Often the file system permissions can be correct, but IIS still won't allow users through if the authentication settings are wrong. 

The re-distributable for the web server for the version which comes with Visual Studio 2010 can be found downloaded from SAP. These links may go stale, but as of 17-Dec-2011: $URL$ The heading of the section is "Download Crystal Reports for Visual Studio 2010" under "Knowledge Center" and the link has text "Redist Installation (64 bit)" The direct link is : $URL$ 

When PartedMagic is selected from the UBCD menu, it shows an options list before it boots, choosing option 4 "Alternative graphical server" will use Xvesa, which is usable. There's still a quirky mouse issue, but mousing off the screen seems to fix it... 

Having come across the same issue on an identical platform again, with no valuable data, I decided to see what would happen and just pressed "Commit Changes" after being given that warning. It turned out that this does did not lose the array, and added the new disk to the existing raid 1 array, as expected. As I suspected, the error message was just too vague: it should have stated that "You will lose data on the new member disk that you are about to add to the existing array, the existing drive will not be touched'. Potentially they made the error message intentionally vague so they could re-use it. 

I want to change SSL bindings to a replacement certificate, but don't want to affect logged in users. Will doing this cause the Application Pools for the web site to recycle? Many thanks, Kenny 

As for legacy kit with a single PSU, as far as I know it's as you say, it's just something that gets dealt with when it happens, but definitely plan for it to happen. I'd make a note of the kit which is set up like this if possible, and plan for the failure, and expect it at one point. I'd suggest making sure backups are well planned and running well, and disaster recovery plans are well thought through and tested regularly. When it comes round to buying new kit, I'd be buying buy those servers with dual PSU, and plugging each into a separate UPS (via PDU if necessary). Even cheap low-end Small-Medium business Dell servers can be bought with dual PSUs. 

It turns out that you must buy a license for Brocade's product called "Fabric Watch" to allow port health monitoring. 

Now - it is obvious that the drive I put in to replace the failed one will have data loss, as it should get data from the working drive synced onto it. However, the Controller's message doesn't state what drive there'll be data loss. It could be that making this change will create a fresh RAID LUN with no data. I don't know, and the controller doesn't make it clear. Can anyone say for definite that this will not affect the data on the original drive? It just worries me that the message states "physical disks" - plural, and not "Data on the secondary physical disk that you just added will be LOST!" No doubt this is what the message means, but I don't like guessing with critical data! Many thanks! 

On a Dell SAS 5/ir RAID controller, I have a RAID 1 array which is Degraded. One drive has failed. Upon replacing this drive the controller doesn't automatically resync the array. There's an option to manually add the new drive to the array, but when I try this, the controller bios shows: Screenshots: $URL$ 

Try adding another host header with the full "betamasteradmin.it.acme.com" and try that address in the browser, presuming it resolves to the server XXX.XXX.45.28 Also, try adding and entry to the server's local DNS in the hosts file c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts to associate betamasteradmin with 127.0.0.1 - that way you can open a web browser on the server, and enter "betamasteradmin" as the url, and this should work. Hosts File Wikipedia Entry That way you can rule out IIS config issues, v.s. network/firewall problems. 

Also, the if you want the default page to show up to those who have not yet been signed into the application, you must allow access with an authorization section like below: (in system.web) 

As long as the rule allows the connection from INTERNAL to DMZ and not the other way around, this seems perfectly sensible to me. You have to be able to manage your machines on DMZ after all, and the login credentials are moving over the network encrypted too, so that's not a problem. 

If I make a change to the file: %windir%\system32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config and update it with a change resulting in a valid config, will it cause IIS7 to restart and force restarts on all the apps? I am trying this out with a hot-cloned vm of the server, but like to know if anyone has experience of either of these scenarios, what the expected outcome should be. Many thanks 

EMC's support portal Powerlink is exactly where you need to go to get this too. The menu structure below mentioned in the question does indeed exist, and is where you need to go to get SWAT: 

Mouse is pointing to a fraction of where it should in a VMware vSphere 4.0 vm with the windows vSphere client. Booting up UBCD -> PartedMagic... The mouse pointer has x/y co-ordinates of a smaller fraction of that which it "should" have. This can be seen here: $URL$ Can anyone work out how I can make the mouse work properly with GParted and vSphere 4? I know I could probably spend ages learning how to use the command line to do what I need here, but the whole point of using GParted is for the GUI.. Cheers! 

There appears to be a great deal of conflicting information about whether or not SAN is required for a Sql Server 2012 Mirroring setup. I currently have an Active-Passive-Witness SQL 2008R2 setup where each of the machines in the setup have plain old DAS raid arrays. I would like to implement exactly the same again with SQL Server 2012, however much of the online documentation (e.g. Prerequisites, Restrictions, and Recommendations for AlwaysOn Availability Groups (SQL Server) - $URL$ suggests each node in the "AlwaysOn Availability Group" must be a node of a Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster. I'm not trying to set up a SQL Server Failover Cluster - only database mirroring between two instances of SQL Server (active-passive-witness). When I look up the requirements for setting up a Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster I always see SAN / shared storage as a requirement. However I have seen a pretty definitive answer to my question here: "AlwaysOn Availability Groups do not require deployment of a Failover Cluster Instance or use of symmetric shared storage (SAN or SMB)." - $URL$ - but am unsure what to believe. Has anybody out there tried an Active-Passive-Witness mirroring setup with SQL Server 2012 and "AlwaysOn Availability Groups" where you didn't need to use SAN / shared storage? Many thanks, Kenny 

It might be the case that my Powerlink account was not verified / validated with EMC, and EMC support had to take some kind of action to give me access to these menus.. or I was just less familiar with Powerlink. :\ 

Do you know where to download EMC's Switch Analysis Tool (SWAT)? I've followed the instructions in the "Customer Advisory Letter" I have regarding FLARE upgrade, but the menu options in EMC PowerLink are not there. The letter states I should find SWAT within Powerlink in "Home > Support > Product and Diagnostic Tools > Environment Analysis Tools > Switch Analysis Tool (SWAT). " - but this menu structure no longer exists, and I've tried searching the site, to no avail. $URL$ Many thanks, Kenny 

A drive failed on a Dell SAS 5i controller - see controller bios screengrab: $URL$ The primary is a 160GB 10k sata drive. I added a 250GB 7k rpm drive in the hope that the array would rebuild onto this drive. This did not happen. (assuming that the controller would just operate at the speed of the slowest drive) The controller could see the new drive, but it didn't automatically rebuild the raid1 onto this drive. (my assumption is that it did not do this rebuild as the drive sizes are different). There was an option to add the new drive to the existing raid1 array - but when I tried this a message appeared stating that all data on the array would be lost. (I didn't get a screenshot of this message, I will later) Should the SAS 5i allow me to rebuild the array onto a larger drive? Is the option to add the drive to the array the right way to go? Many thanks! 

| tape drive 1 | ---- | switch 1 | ---- hba1 | backup server | hba2 ---- | switch 2 | -----| tape drive 2 | Our backup server has 2 FC HBAs. Each is zoned into a different drive on the back of the tape library via a separate switch. Each tape is connected to a different switch presumably to allow for the switch to fail yet allow the backup server to still have one accessible tape. We seem to have lost an HBA. As a temporary measure, is it possible to move the tape drive into the other switch which is still connected to the backup server and zone the one HBA into both FC Tape drives? ---- | switch 1 | ---- hba1 | backup server | hba2 ---- | switch 2 | -----| tape drive 2 | + | tape drive 1 | Will this confuse Backup Exec seeing both tape drives coming from one HBA, or dos EMC's HBAnywere software or drivers abstract this away knowledge away from the application and just present the tape drives to the Operating System regardless of which HBA they are appearing..? My suspicion would be that you can have as many LUNS as you want (within OS Max) coming from one HBA or the other HBA and probably Backup Exec wouldn't know the difference, but I can't risk just changing these things without the concrete knowledge that I'm not going to make things worse. I don't want to risk Backup Exec's access to the last working tape drive. Thanks! 

I have discovered a Description entry ("EMC Flex 8-16") in an systems audit which I can't identify. I have asked the Vendors, but have not yet heard back. I'll post an answer myself when I find out. I have been unable to find info via searching the web (or EMC's support site). So for myself and others who may in the future attempt to identify the same thing, does anyone know what it is? I have a "gut feeling", but would love to hear from anyone who actually knows. Many thanks, Kenny
