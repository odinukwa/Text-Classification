Did you try to disconnect the session with the help of the "Terminal Services Manager". I don't know how the tool is called in Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows 7. In Windows 2003 / Windows XP you could connect to the server via the Terminal Service Manager and disconnect the session. Or try to restart the Windows service "Remote desktop services" on the Windows Server 2008 R2. The connected users should automatically be disconnected (never tried this before). Greetings grub 

Active Directory servers act as NTP servers per default. You can specify them as NTP targets for your XenServer 

When you enable autologon in TweakUI the tool only changes a few registry keys. The first thing you should do is to check the registry keys You can find a Microsoft Knowledge base article about the automatic logon here: $URL$ 

How do you try to download the windows updates? I'm pretty sure you have to download the updates from the WSUS 3.0 SP2 MMC Snapin and deploy them from there. I dont think it's possible to download and install updates directly from microsoft on a server running WSUS. 

I think you're starting way too much server instances. Which module are you using as worker? prefork.c or worker.c? If youre using prefork.c set the values 'StartServers', MinSpareServers and MaxSpareServers to a lower value and look if the server hangs again. 

Maybe you can deinstall with VBS and WMI. It's possible to access the entries in "Add / Remove Software". So if PopMessenger has an entry you can try to deinstall it automatically with a script. The script works on Windows XP per default not for Windows Server 2003 (missing some wmi classes). Save the script as deinstall_popmessenger.vbs and run it. Edit strSoftwareName and run it. First you'll get a popup if the software - entry was found. the line to uninstall the software is inactvie (comment '). 

You can create n VM's with 4 vCPU's. The question is if the performance of the vm's will be good. Best practice is just to add 1 vCPU per VM and add another vCPU if you really need one. I just have one or two VM's with 4 vCPU's. Every VM's shares the physical CPU's of the host system. As more vCPU's you add the more time slices a VM get to work on the physical CPU. Normally you don't reserve a physical CPU only for one VM. It's possible but normally not needed. 

The problem was solved ultimately by installing the latest MS SQL 2000 service packs prior installing the Service Pack for the OS. 

Youve got the tool Distributed File System under Start -> programs -> Administrative Tools. If you dont have it (for example on Windows XP) you can download the administration tool pack from microsoft: $URL$ With the tool you can at least check the status (is the server and share online). Please clearify what exactly you want to monitor or troubleshoot. Are you experiencing some dfs related issues? There are a few key points to check: 

I think FreeNAS fits your needs. My personal opinion is that a FreeNAS is easier to set up then OpenFiler and the webinterface is more simple and easy to use and understand. The biggest disadvantage about openfiler is that the official documentation is only available if you pay for it. 

I compared the configuration of the SDO service and the system configuration with another server on which the Windows Server 2003 SP2 is installed and SDO is working. The configuration is the same and the same driver and software versions are used. Do you have any idea what causes the connection issue? Should I deinstall the unicenter service and make a fresh installation on the server or should I remove the Windows Server 2003 SP2? I don't want to remove the SP2 because it's a requirement for WSUS3 SP2 and I really don't want to know how many possible exploits are possible in such an old system ;-) Thank you very much and have a nice day. 

As long as you're using a strong password for the user account which need to read the credentials it should be save to use the credential file. I'm using the credential files for many scheduled tasks (non-interacive shell). The shell is automatically closed after the scheduled tasks is finished and the $cred variable is deleted. In interactive shells I dont use the credential files because I'm able to specify username and password manually. Hope this helps. Have a nice day. Greetings grub 

Yesterday I installed the Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 on a Windows Server 2003 which has Unicenter Software Delivery 4 installed. Prior to the installation I disabled every CA service on the server (Brightstor, SDO , RCO, TNG) and the MS SQL 2000 service. After the installation of the SP2 I enabled the services again but the Unicenter Service is not able to connect to the MS SQL 2000 Database anymore. The database itself is up and running and I can connect to it with the Enterprise Manager. A dbcc checkdb doesnt return any errors on the Unicenter database. The Unicenter service throws the following error messages during startup: 

The easiest way to integrate Domino is to use Lotus Quickr 1. We also have a big Lotus Domino Server farm but we're using sharepoint because of it's office integration and it is really easy to use. Whatever you're going to use I recommendend you to hire an consultant to get started with such a project. Both solutions are really big and you can waste much time without reaching your goals. 

Are you using Active Directory? Then you can use a Group Policy to change / add / remove Registry Settings for every user which logs onto a machine in the domain. If you cant use GPO maybe a shortcut to a script which sets the values in C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup can help you. 

The dns resolution works fine, and I've already rejoined the server into the domain. Could it be any issue with netbios ? Or do you now a method to debug the network share connection more detailed ? The hardware looks OK. DELL OpenManage is installed and does not report any errors. The newest drivers for the Intel NIC is installed. Thank you very much for your help, I have never seen such an issue before and do not know how to collect more information for the error. 

At the first glance I would tell there is something wrong with your data partition (/data/data4). What kind of storage are you using? local disks, raid, nfs? Do you have any snapshots created for the vm's? If possible try to enable verbose logging somehow. I didn't find any VMware KB for the VMware Server 2 but there should be a configuration file in /etc or /opt. As always the question: why are you using VMware Server and not VMware ESXi? VMware Server 2 is not under development anymore and it's pretty slow if you compare it to ESXi. greetings grub 

I'm assuming you're using HA in your cluster. Maybe the VM's don't meet the Fault Tolerance. Have you tried do deactivate HA and try to move the VM's to another Host? If everything is alright with the cluster (hardware, licenses) I would just deactivate HA, wait a few minutes and activate HA again. 

If I try to connect to the server from a computer which is in another domain and ip subnet I get another error message (connection from client to server is possible): 

Normaly the /tmp directory is writeable for everyone. You shouldn't be concerned about this. Additional the sticky bit is set so only root and the owner of a file can delete that file. 

Below you can find more detailed information about the system and the SDO service. psinfo output (system information) 

Maybe this blog entry can help you: $URL$ I remember that there is a Xorg Server plugin which enables you to open a vnc connection similar to a rdp session in windows with user authentication over your display manager but I really dont find the link to the plugin anymore. 

Are you talking abozt a windows server and widnows workstations? Maybe you can use psexec from sysinternals: $URL$ you can exetue a command on the remote server psexec -u domain\user -p pass \\server command 

It depends on the linux distribution you're using. under debian like systems you have to change the contents of the file /etc/network/interfaces on rhel systems you have to edit the file /etc/sysconfig/networking-scripts/ifcfg- (where is the name of your ethernet card e.g. eth0) you can add the entry "gateway" followed by the ip adress. as soon as you restart your network interface the routes will be added automatically to your routing table. Like Michael already wrote you can also just add the corresponding route instead of editing the configuration files.
