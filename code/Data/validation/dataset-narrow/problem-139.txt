What if you don't use a patch panel, then decide you have to move your switch further down the rack or you need to move the connection to equipment in a different location in the rack? Now your cable is not long enough to reach the new location. You are screwed because now you have to run an entire new cable through the walls. With a patch panel you would just grab a longer patch cable and be done with it. 

You can't route based on layer 7 application using only BGP. BGP features will only allow you to tweak the actual prefix advertisements/preference, not anything at layer 7. For active application inspection and policy routing you would need an external service provider to act as a reverse proxy for your public subnet. Then you would build a GRE tunnel from each of your ISP connections to this provider and they forward you the traffic down these tunnels. I haven't heard of anyone offering this type of application load balancing service, but it doesn't seem unrealistic since there are security services that operate in this same manner in order to "scrub" malicious traffic before sending it to your site. 

Tuning requires a bit of trial and error since all situations are unique. I would suggest the following as a starting point: 

It seems your question is actually about duplicate IP addressing. If your system has the same IP address as a remote system, it will always choose itself because it believes that it owns that IP address and will never consider a remote system as having that IP. 

It doesn't make sense to me that it cannot reach my laptop to download the final file after it has already downloaded the kernel and other files from my laptop successfully. On top of that, the WLC package works flawlessly. 

My first thought is that the flash was full. Which is odd since normally updating the firmware, I overwrite the old firmware. However, even resulted in an error: 

The 2950 capped at 12.1 from what I saw on Cisco's support site. I don't know what changed from 12.1 -> 15.0.2-SE6. You'd have to look into that. You could probably get away with some basic stuff but considering the port counts are possibly different and the port types are almost certainly different (Ethernet/FastEthernet on the 2950? to GigabitEthernet on the 2960S) you wouldn't be able to do a direct copy and past. You could copy and paste it into notepad or your text editor of choice and do a replace on FastEthernet for GigabitEthernet and add or remove ports that either did or did not exist on the 2950. Personally I'd wait and do the config from scratch on the 2960S. It shouldn't take long to do and that way you're not missing a step in converting an old config to a new config and messing with different ports and such. EDIT 2: If you were to load a bad IOS image on a router, switch or AP, you can boot into rommon/recovery mode on the device and use TFTP to download a working image to the unit. I have yet to see a Cisco device without this ability. 

You have to at least create static host routes pointing to the endpoint IPs of your tunnel to make sure they remain established. Front door vrf is handy if your endpoint is using a dynamic IP address, forcing you to have a default route pointing out the internet circuit. Splitting it into different vrfs allows you create a second default route pointing down a tunnel. Edit: When you create a tunnel, you will have a source IP and destination IP for the tunnel. 

Check your feasible successors. The big advantage with EIGRP is the use of feasible successors which is basically a backup route that EIGRP knows is loop-free and it can start using immediately if the primary route is lost. Since you are using default metrics, you need to tune the bandwidth and delay settings of your interfaces to make sure there is a feasible successor available. You can check for them in 

If you are using 802.1x on a cisco switch, you can configure the interface to fallback to an authorized vlan if the server is dead. 

I don't have a Juniper EX to test this on and it is for an SRX, but JunOS is built to be standardized across platforms, so these steps may work on the EX. How to block Telnet and SSH Brute Force log-in attacks 

If you want to avoid pointing your default route to your ISP (maybe you want to point down a tunnel instead), you will need at a minimum to create a host route for the tunnel destination IP address pointing to the ISP. 

How do I resolve this issue without trying a reboot of the AP and risking it not booting due to a flash error? 

Expanding on generalnetworkerror's answer: In addition to adding the mail server to send out mail from (), you must use logging level info for seeing when someone connects or if you just want when they disconnect (which has a duration in the message), use logging level warn. These are the email results from a lab ASA5505 running 8.4 using logging level info (1 line per email): 

Cisco won't allow more than one SSID per VLAN per Interface using Autonomous APs. Can't answer for WLCs, but I would assume the same thing. If you have a single radio AP, I recommend having a test VLAN to go with the test SSID and then have your router route between the VLANs. AP Message When Attempting: 

ISPA -> translates to outside for most people, 0 security interface Corporate -> object-group network containing the local/MPLS subnets France -> object-group network containing the remote site subnets This applies to the ACLs as well. However you will need to use: 

We have a network with a bunch of 3560 switches setup and desktops/laptops and some Rockwell Automation equipment connected to them. We had to add a new switch, a 3560X to the network recently to add capacity. After adding this switch, a bunch of the Rockwell Automation devices detect duplicate IPs from the MAC of the new switch. This does not occur with any desktops/laptops/printers/etc. The issue happens to Rockwell equipment plugged into 3 different switches. All wired ports use vlan 101. It is on subnet: 10.2.30.0/23 All network devices are on vlan 2 for management. Subnet: 10.32.2.0/24 The new switch did have an interface on vlan 101 without an IP assigned (mistake) which I removed recently but the issue persisted. I am rebooting the switch now as at least on the routers, the interface persists in a deleted state until a reboot. I am going to be setting up an RSPAN for the ports with equipment having the issue next if this persists after the reboot. What would cause end user devices to think a switch has the same IP as them? We have not had this issue at any other site with the same setup. Switch layout: 

It's because R1 doesn't know how to reach those other interfaces (it doesn't have routes for those networks). You need routes on R1 pointing to R2 for the other two subnets. R1 of course knows how to reach 172.16.2.2 because it has an interface on that network. 

For point-to-point links, use a maximum size of /30. Depending on your model of router, it may support a subnet size of /31 which would be even better. Carve these small subnets out of your unused space. You can reserve a /24 network and use it only for p2p links, then take your smaller /30 /31 subnets from this space. 

There really isn't a "right or wrong" answer on how to do it. You have to weigh the pros and cons and decide for yourself. Usually a centralized model would be used where all of your security hardware is in the DC, so you backhaul a remote location which doesn't have a firewall or web proxy back through the equipment in the DC. This requires bigger hardware at the DC to accomidate all the remote locations as well as higher bandwidth MPLS circuits. Or the distributed model where you offload the internet locally would require firewalls at every location to secure this traffic, but then you may also be able to use some smaller hardware at the DC since it doesn't have to worry about that traffic. You could also use lower bandwidth MPLS circuits based on the traffic patterns. 

You could use PKI in your authentication which would require assigning certs to devices. This is covered under the AnyConnect Essentials license. One thing to note, I have never gotten any ASA to accept any certs encrypted with higher than 2048 bits. This may have changed in releases newer than 9.1.2 though. A more in depth option would be using the Host Scan and Posture Module of AnyConnect. This requires the AnyConnect Premium license and depending on which options, it may require further licensing. This gives you more control and you can limit access to systems with specific registry keys, BIOS serial numbers, OSes, AntiVirus, Firewalls, etc. 

Then you will need a device to route between them. A quick lookup on your switch did not show it as supporting layer 3 routing. So you may need an upgrade or a dedicated router. Once you have a router, you would configure 3 interfaces, one per VLAN for routing. On these interfaces you can apply an ACL to block traffic you don't want. 

When installing the SRE-V software on one of my SRE modules in a Cisco 2911, it keeps failing to download the final files after loading the Linux kernel. These are the interface configs from the router: 

I'm sure there are more that others can fill in I just don't know what the other negatives are We only use them in our colo setup. Was cheaper to have an integrated switch in the G2 router that we supplied than to pay for another RU and a 1U switch. 

This depends on the model of device. Some of them have dedicated physical management interfaces. Others just use a vlan SVI interface. 

The router is using proxy ARP. This is a feature enabled by default. Since the router knows how to reach the destination address, it will respond on the host's behalf with its own MAC address and all frames from the source will be sent to the router which can then route to the destination. Cisco Proxy ARP 

I wasn't able to paste this picture in the comments. Usually what you want is your full mesh connections to all be in the backbone area 0. Then you split off other stub areas that are all attached to area 0. So all of your WAN links would be in area 0, then the links on the router towards the local site LAN would be in its own area. 

If it supports LAG you can combine the redundant links into port-channels that are viewed as a single link. However, both of those links would have to connect to the same Cisco switch unless you are running VSS or Nexus vPC. 

QoS will apply policies to different traffic classes as it passes through the device, such as giving priority to certain traffic. But it does not signal to the transmitter to pause. Flow control operates at the interface level and will send a Pause to an upstream transmitter telling them to pause transmission (assuming they also are set up to honor flow control messages). This can affect all traffic passing over the interface. There is an enhancement called priority flow control which applies flow control based on CoS class. The devices negotiate this using LLDP DCBX and exchange their QoS configurations, if they match, then they can successfully use priority flow control between them. Overview of PFC 

Occasionally I have an issue when I try to SCP a file to one of our Cisco devices. When the connection starts, it immediately drops and says "lost connection". I've had this happen when there wasn't enough space on the flash drive but this isn't the case today. Below is the failure from a 3750X switch and the pertinent config info from the switch. 

Ok, file system fixed. Free space created. Did all of this fix the original issue of updating the firmware? Yes: 

All set! EDIT: Note: When importing the key, make sure there are no extra spaces around the key info. If you copy and paste from a console, this may put trailing spaces on every line and you need to remove those before importing. 

Note: When configuring these settings, if you don't have the "Apply" button highlight afterwards, you will need to do something in ASDM that will activate the button and allow you to click it. None of the DAP settings for AnyConnect specifics would apply automatically nor trigger the Apply button so I could apply the settings. I had to go modify another setting, click apply, modify the setting back, click apply. This was using ASDM 7.1 on a 9.1.2 ASA5525-X. Regarding question 2 on the licensing: There are no client-side licensing options that I am aware of. The only license not necessarily tied to the ASA directly is the AnyConnect Premium which may be pulled off of a "server" ASA with a pool of session licenses for multiple "client" ASAs. In the end, they're applied to an ASA still. Source:$URL$ 

This way you can reach the other end of the tunnel. Then you can point the default route down a tunnel and it won't break your tunnel. 

Look into enabling BFD. BFD is a separate protocol that EIGRP can subscribe to for failure detection. It can provide sub-second failure detection in a LAN environment, but you don't want that over a lossy WAN connection like the internet. You'll tune the timers higher for the WAN, but the advantage with BFD is you can configure BFD dampening. When you are on the border of a cell/sat connection you can get a lot of flapping back and forth when using low timers, if you configure dampening it will detect the flapping and stop the convergence for a time period to stabilize the connection. 

Cisco routers support a type of dynamic access list called a reflexive access list. It observes outbound traffic and will automatically add an entry to the inbound access-list permitting the return traffic. 

In the case of vPC configurations, both HSRP/VRRP peers will actively route packets when they receive them. It is a special behavior for vPC. Some information on vPC active/active routing 

You don't need fabricpath to run a vPC+ from a FEX. Fabricpath is really only useful in large data centers where you have a multiple tier topology (Core, Aggregation, Access). In a smaller setup using a collapsed core type design, vPC is simpler and accomplishes the same goal of getting rid of spanning tree.
