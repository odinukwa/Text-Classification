and it's re-applied. Of course since this is applied to a VLAN, you need to be in the VLAN configuration context, so this is what it looks like in practice (with the prompt): 

When I add the switch to the SNMP application, the application registers on the switch as a trap receiver with IP address 172.16.0.2. When I ping the switch from the W2K8, the source address is the VPN IP of my PC, 10.10.10.10. I can ping the VPN IP of my PC from the switch. However I can't ping the IP of the W2K8. The obvious reason is that there's no route to 172.16.0.0/24. And when I check the switch status regarding the SNMP application, I only see "Connecting". I've tried to configure the switch for mgmt. app IP 172.16.0.2 as well as the VPN IP 10.10.10.10 with no luck. Configuring the Virtual Server IP to different modes produces these ping results: Ping from the switch to my PC VPN IP is always successful. I can never ping the W2K8 from host OS - ipconfig doesn't show IP 172.16.0.1. The DSL Router WAN port won't respond to ping from the Internet side. NAT or NAT Network: 

Download iperf. This is a simple, but very powerful network performance tool. Start with default TCP testing. You can change the parameters, run UDP test etc. afterwards for more specified testing. Use the same two devices in all testing to exclude host-based differences Where to connect depends on what exactly is tested - cabling, patch panels etc. are also potential sources of latency I would use static IPs in all testing; I don't want my test devices do anything I do not specifically instruct them to do including renewing the IP 

Copying here hat I put in Super User a few days ago: I had a peek at the not-too-informative manuals and the not-much-more-informative website. I did notice your setup is the same test setup you find in the installation guide. There's the same test, ping from laptop connecting to the Client to the laptop connecting to the AP. If it works, test is successful; there's no mention that pinging the other way should be successful or even tested. There's four modes; AP, Client, Master and Slave. AP is clear, Master/Slave combo is for creating a wireless bridge (WDS). I guess the Client mode is intended for using this device as a dumb wireless NIC. In that mode you'd connect the box to Ethernet NIC of another device which has no WiFi capability. The Client is the one which connects to the wireless network, just as a wless NIC does, and acts the same way - passes traffic between the wireless interface and the "bus", i.e. the Ethernet interface. Since the other device is not actually connecting to the network itself, it won't be seen and it shouldn't need an IP address at all. Run a Wireshark trace on laptop A when you're pinging from laptop B. I bet the ICMP echo packets are originating from IP address .127.254. If I'm right, from the network point of view address .127.1 doesn't exist at all. I think that if you want specifically laptop B itself to be pingable, you'd need to configure Master/Slave mode. However there's a catch: now .127.253 is in AP mode, which means any wless client can connect to it. The specs specify two antennas, but I couldn't find out how many radios the device has. One radio can only perform one function, it's either serving the WDS bridge, or serving wireless clients. So if there's only one radio, the Master and Slave can only talk to each other, not to wless clients. Please do let me know :-) 

Since it's said that the 8200s are connected with "DT-LACP trunks" I assume the Inter-switch link required for DT is present between them. If these links are in the same VLAN and STP is not enabled, there is a loop. This is what Distributed Trunking looks like: 

The event message means that the connected device is incessantly transmitting either oversized packets with CRC errors (jabbering), or fragmented frames. This is unlikely to be caused by a duplex mismatch. The usual symptoms of DM are Excessive CRC/Alignment errors, link flapping and port defaulting to HDx mode. The switch isn't usually the root cause either, it's just reporting what it is receiving on the port. The usual root causes for jabbering are failure of the physical connector, firmware or driver of the connecting device; or bad cabling / patch panel. Here's what to do about this: 

The links on 8200s are configured for Distributed Trunk, and the link between them as Switch Interconnect link which makes the downlinks to each edge switch appear as one logical link. The uplinks on switches E and F are aggregated with LACP so each of them will see one logical link as well. There is no loop. If there's a redundant link between switches E and F and it's in the same VLAN as the uplinks, a loop will form. STP is needed to counteract that, and root and path priorities must be configured so that STP blocks the redundant link. 

The picture only appears to show your Netgear configuration, but not the physical topology. If your Firewall has 2 ports (LAN and Internet) it should be physically connected like this: 

I believe you mean to say that the router has an IP address 192.168.1.1/24, and this is the default gateway for clients in subnet 192.168.1.0/24? The router has another default route pointing to somewhere in the Internet. Think of a subnet as a house, and gateway as a door. To get into or out of the house you must use the door of that house, neighbor's door just won't do. The same way to get into or out of subnet 192.168.2.0/24 your SonicWall must have an IP address on this range. This is the IP interface it will use to route traffic into and out of this subnet. So basically you must create the Avaya VLAN in your SonicWall and give it an IP address 192.168.2.1/24. This is the IP you use as default gateway for devices in the Avaya VLAN. Then you tag the link between the switch and the SonicWall to the Avaya VLAN, and traffic should flow correctly. You should be able to do this configuration in a live production network without causing any disruption in the network services. 

So only one cable between the FW and the switch, VLANs created on the switch and LAN port of the FW. The link between switch and FW LAN port should be the one tagged, all edge ports untagged to whichever VLAN they belong to. If you are running your firewall's Internet connection through switch port 1, have office PC connected to ports 2-4 and ports 1-4 are on the same VLAN on the switch, the firewall is not protecting your office PCs. 

Ensure that both devices are running current SW/FW to exclude SW-related issues Use a brand new cable directly connected between the Airport and the switch to exclude faulty cabling / patch panel Verify that both device ports are set to Autonegotiation - this is default setting in most networking devices, I'd expect Airport to use that as well Test by setting both ends of the link to fixed 100FDx or 1000FDx mode - this will exclude negotiation errors Test in one of the first 12 ports - this will exclude failing switch port, or port controller If possible test with another Airport 

This shows you how heavily used each channel is (in this example on b/g 2.4Ghz spectrum). Set your router's radio to channel with least usage. If you're on b/g, in Americas you should choose 1, 6 or 11; elsewhere you can also choose 1, 7, 13. This because the channels overlap, so if you set your radio to for example ch3 you're getting interference from neighboring radios on both ch1 and ch6. BTW while scanning don't associate your device to the WiFi, that'll skew the scan. Note that these applications will only show you WiFi-related info, not non-WiFi interference. Try moving the router to a different place. Under the table, in a cupboard or behind a TV are not ideal locations. Keeping the antenna(s) upright is (usually) the best option, as is having basically line-of-sight between the antenna and your device. And don't hang anything on the antenna(s) or place the device right next to a metal plate. Yes, sometimes different standard can give you a better performance. If your devices are capable of n on 5GHz spectrum, test setting the radio on that. 5GHz has much less usage (and interference) than 2.4GHz. If you're currently on n, test setting the radio to b/g. Note that you only configure this on the router, not on the client. Test with different driver versions - sometimes older may work better. Also I'd suggest that you check which Wireless NIC your device has and google if other people are experiencing issues with it. 

I'd say it looks normal. But I think you're doing this a bit wrong. Ping has one function only: probing, i.e. "Hello, are you there" - "Hello, yes I am here". While it shows you the latency between two hosts, it is not a network performance tool. Your "empty" network is never silent. When you connect two network devices together - any devices - they will start exchanging all kinds of information immediately; availability, capabilities, link status etc. This is (like ICMP) network management traffic, and handled by the CPU. The primary function of any network device is traffic forwarding. When the first packet of a discussion comes, a Layer 2 switch will first check the MAC/ARP tables to see if the port leading to the destination is known. If not, it will ARP the network to learn the destination port. Once it is known, the traffic forwarding is delegated to the forwarding engine. CPU will not touch packets in that discussion, but it will still keep communicating with the other network devices. L3 forwarding (i.e routing) is often done entirely by the CPU. This depends on the device, some routing switches are capable of hardrware packet forwarding similar to L2 switching. This is known as "route once / switch many" or "Multilayer switching". The network devices are configured to maintain the primary functionality of the network. All mgmt traffic it's given secondary priority, and ICMP ping has the lowest of low priorities. This is - as far as I know - true for all devices. Allowing ICMP a higher priority would open door for DOS attacks such as Ping of Death and Ping Flood. Hence tests 2 and 3 are irrelevant. Devices are responding, which shows traffic is flowing correctly. The devices will not sacrifice CPU cycles for ping, they will respond only when (or if!) they have time. Once the network gets more traffic, you can expect higher variation on network device ping responses. It's still expected behavior, their latency has no relation whatsoever to network performance. Host-to-host response times should be less affected. Tests 1 and 4 are more sensible; but they aren't a valid comparison between L2 and L3 forwarding performance. In test 1 you're pinging a "resource", in test 4 you're pinging a server - i.e. not the same device. While the network may be playing part, the latency depends on the recipient. What's above applies also to any computer; a NIC is a network device and ICMP is handled by CPU... maybe your server is taking it's own sweet time responding. When you're pinging to a different subnet you're bringing in yet another potential source of latency - the default gateways. If you want to test the forwarding capability of your network, you need to do it differently. 

Do the tests one at a time, and you'll identify the point of failure. If not, or if the failure appears to be on the switch, call support. That 2920 carries a lifetime warranty (if purchased from a legit HP reseller) so you only pay for a local call. Applicable HP Knowledge base articles: 

Actually your definition of stacking is correct, and your vendor's not. However he might be referring to traditional HP Stacking, which indeed isn't "true" stacking at all. Bigger HP switches are stacked with iRF, which 2920 doesn't do. You do need the stacking kits to create a single virtual switch out of 2 physical ones. HP Whitepaper on 2920 stacking 

Correct. DNS is a service which resolves a name to an IP address. If you are not pinging a name, you aren't using DNS. 

Just configure your DHCP server with scope 192.168.0.2 - 192.168.255.254 and subnet mask 255.255.0.0. Here's an example how to do it with Microsoft DHCP server: 

There's a very simple answer. Management traffic such as SSH, HTTP, ICMP is handled by the CPU. The main purpose of the switch is traffic forwarding, and management traffic has the lowest priority. Thus when CPU is roofing, all mgmt access gets trampled underway to preserve the network services. If you're running and old code you might be bumping into a SW issue. Download current SW from HPN website and upgrade. If you don't need the latest and greatest features but rather are interested in stability, go for the Maintenance release, current one is K.15.10.0015m. It has longer lifespan than the others, and new features aren't added so it will update only if there's a bugfix. PVID mismatch is also a simple one. The PVID of Procurve is the VLAN id of the untagged VLAN. PVID mismatch shouldn't affect the CPU, but it will fill up your log with unnecessary crap. Mismatching the VLAN tagging also causes broadcasts from one subnet to spill into another which isn't a behavior you want to see. So ensure VLAN tagging matches on both ends of the link.
