I have a configuration with ARR on a front-end server and an IIS (8) web farm behind it. SSL is enabled with the same certificate on the ARR server and the IIS web farm servers and I am not using SSL offloading. The servers are using Shared Config so the setup is theoretically identical. Interestingly, when the ARR round robin configuration hits ONE of the servers, it returns a "502 - Web server received an invalid response while acting as a gateway or proxy server." error. Another server returns the page fine with SSL working. If I point my browser to the "bad" server directly, without ARR, it works fine in HTTPS / SSL mode. I checked the configurations and found nothing different between the servers and even enabled Failed Request Tracing on the ARR server, which wasn't that helpful but I saw a different 502.3 error within the log. Why would I get a 502 error of any kind, especially on just one server in the farm when they are configured identically with shared config and certificates are on all servers? 

I already have 2 domain controllers running Windows Server 2012 R2. This network doesn't have any file servers or SANs. It hardly needs any. But, I have one small need for a shared file folder and I would prefer it to be redundant. So I could set up 2 dedicated servers just for this purpose, but that seems like such a waste for one file folder share that will have just a couple files. Instead, can I just use my 2 domain controllers? I would want to install a failover cluster for file sharing on them. 

Let me answer my own question... I disabled "Require Server Name Indication" and suddenly everything worked. This is weird because SNI was enabled on all servers in the farm for the same site but for one of them, unchecking it made it all work. My theory is this: Even with shared config, SSL binding information doesn't really transfer from one server to the other, from the IP to the certificate. As many of you know, you still have to manually go to the other server and select the certificate. So that was a clue about how the setups could be different. I actually believe the setups were the same visually but somewhere under the hood something was different for one binding somehow. Anyway, I spent hours on this issue and nowhere did I read anything about "Require Server Name Indication" being related to a 502 error. So I wanted to share with the internet community so that future people will know to look at that setting if they are stuck with a 502 error when using SSL. Maybe there is a way to keep it enabled, since it was working on the rest of my farm, but at the very least you'll know in what area you might need to be looking to solve your 502 error. Of course, remember that the first cause of 502 errors in my opinion is not having the certificate installed on all servers when not using SSL offloading but that was not my issue, and mine was unique in that just one server in a farm was misbehaving with SSL enabled. I hope this helps someone else. 

You have deleted the file but the file descriptor is still open and used by the running script. Stop the script and you should get the space back. It's a better idea to truncate the file with or 

You can try to use to check which processes are using the network connections. List al network connections: List all the TCP or UDP connections: Processes listening on a particular port: List network files which are being used by a process: List the network files opened by the processes starting with ssh: 

In CentOS/RedHat you also to enable the SSL rsyslog port in SElinux. Something like should do the trick. You can check your current syslog port with Also you can try, to run rsyslog in debug mode, to see whats happening: Stop rsyslog daemon, then 

You need to modify the root directory for your virtual host. Otherwise you will have a subdomain which will show exactly the same data as your main domain. For subdomain.domain.com you should set the of the subdomain to and for subdomain2.domain.com to etc. Check out the examples 

I wouldn't worry at all about the small swap usage. It happens that kernel drops some data from memory to swap. You can control the behavior of kernel with the swappiness option: 

You would get much better results using puppet modules for apt, nodejs etc. take a look at puppet forge. Using exec is a bad idea, as you really need to take care of the idempotency on your own. For example instead of lines: 

This is a story old as Unix and Linux systems, if you search on stackexchange for "du and df" you will find a lot of answers. 

You won't receive any mails, because the SMTP servers send mails between each other on port 25. ISP's block the outgoing port 25 to stop spam and this is now almost "an industry standard". Port 465 and 587 should be used for client - server connections only, so 99% of SMTP servers which will send mails to your server will do it on port 25. As you have changed the port from 25 to 465, they won't be able to connect to your server. Most probably you would need some kind of relay host which will forward mails to your server on different port. 

Is it possible to create a software RAID 10 using SAN LUN's presented to server on 4 paths? I'm running Ubuntu 14.04 with 64 GB of RAM Target is to achieve better I/O, storage and network teams have done all that is possible from their end to provide the best I/O's possible. and I believe if we can do software RAID 10 using SAN LUN's presented on the server with additional SAN LUN's we should be able to achieve better performance. 

I want to know the reason why it's happening and is there any other command to list such mount points which are hidden otherwise? Thanks in advance and apologies for poor English & if this is not the right site for such a question. 

I'm completely new to the scripts and hence need help to fix this. We've around 3000 VMs & 450 Physical servers which are Linux based servers (few of then ubuntu starting from 9.x & few of them are Susu starting 8.X & majority of them are RHEL starting from 4.x till 7.4) on all of them I need to add few hostname entries with IP details into their respective /etc/hosts files. I've different users on each server with full sudoers access which I can use Hence I've created a CSV file with hostname, username & password format. which contains required details to log in. Filename is "hostname_logins.csv" I need to upload a file (i.e. hostname_list to each of these servers and then update those same details in each of the servers host files. I'll be running this script using one RHEL 6 server. (All of the other hosts are resolvable from this server & are reachable, I've confirmed it already.) hence need help to fix this script. script not sure what's wrong in it as I'm a new to scripts: 

1 I have configured Ubuntu server with Key authentication & it is working fine. I have disabled password authentication for key authentication to work. Server is always accessed via remote terminals or putty. Now all user accounts are able to login with the authentication Key and passphrase. But now I want to create only one new user without key authentication. So how should I go about it However on the other hand this should not hamper other users who are using key authentication.
