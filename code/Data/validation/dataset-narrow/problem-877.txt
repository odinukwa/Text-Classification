I have no idea of the cause, but I suggest you begin your troubleshooting by concentrating on getting the service restarted. You can be sure that whatever prevents it from being restarted will also be causing it to fail in the first place. 

Yes, that's a classic SQL injection attack. Your only real long term defence is to secure the application, though you can ban IPs as required and there are various tools out there which will attempt to automate this. Ultimately, unless it becomes a DOS attack, they should be relatively harmless if your site is injection proof. That side of things is more StackOverflow, though. 

WireShark sits too low in the network stack to have any information on which processes sent or received traffic. The trick is to know something about what you're looking for - it shouldn't take that long to isolate traffic by Source IP, Destination IP, Source Port or Destination Port. 

I was installing Server2003 Std and Server2008 Std on hardware recently. When joining the servers to the domain during the install, I was asked for credentials. I answered with the the DC's Admin user and password. What minimum level of credentials are normally required to join a member server to a domain? 

With the value set to true, the module was trying to remove from the system, not, as I assumed, in the directory. 

I have a server that I use infrequently, so I'd like to a job to shutdown daily if no users are logged in via SSH and SAMBA shares. How can I determine how many active SSH connections there are, and how many active SAMBA connections there are? If both of these values are zero, the cron script will shutdown the server. 

You should set your XP workstation to use Bridged networking, instead of NATing through the host. Then you can treat the XP guest like any other machine on your network. 

This is a classic case of trying to solve a people problem with a technical solution. Is it possible? Not as standard, no. Is there a workaround? Almost certainly, you could run a script or service to monitor the folder and rename things. Should you? In my opinion, no. Any attempt to come up with some hacky solution will only lead to excruciating pain down the line, probably won't ever work properly anyway, and you'll then become responsible for the entire naming scheme. Conclusion: It'a a management problem. The offenders need to be told to work properly and adhere to policy, just like any other workplace rules. That said, it seems like you need a proper document management system. Some of them are very powerful, though they still require the user to use it properly! 

I'm using a fairly vanilla Ubuntu 10.04 server installation, and I'm experimenting with BTRFS. How can I create a BTRFS RAID1 mount? I've got two (2) 1Gig drives that I popped in the server and after running the following commands, it appears I've got a 2 Gig partition, not 1 Gig as I would expect. 

I'm putting together an file server which will have a very limited number of users (less than 5) and offer the following services: 

I've configured my router to accept a public key SSH session with a passphrase. They key pair was generated using the PuTTY tools on windows. I can open the session from both Windows and Linux using the Putty tools, but I can't do so with on Linux. When prompted by for the keyfile's passphrase, it fails. Ex: 

A very crude way to do this would be to save the running configuration, make the change and then set the router to reboot.* Many engineers use this method when working remotely to ensure that they can get back to the box is they accidentally break the way they're connected. Use the following command to set a reboot in 5 minutes (I don't know what the max is, but it's always in minutes). And then use the second command to subsequently cancel it when you're happy. 

Why do people insist on hard coding links instead of using relative paths? There are products which will do a bulk find and replace in a folder which would be more of a maintainable long term solution. 

I'm not going to lie, I've never ever ran Disk Cleanup on a server in 7 years of managing Windows based networks. Personally I'd either delete the files manually or just delete the local user profile. I assume this stuff isn't in their roaming profile, if applicable? I'd be far more concerned as to what has been going wrong to generate 3Gbs of error reporting! 

I've configured to automagically mount a cifs share when users login; the problem is if a user logs into multiple times simultaneously, the mount command is repeated multiple times. This so far isn't a problem but it's messy when you look at the output of a command. 

I've got a number of Windows (7/Vista/XP) based machines on a network that have no unifying structure (i.e. no ADC, PDC or for that matter a workgroup). I recently added a Linux box with a fairly sizable raid setup that I'd like to use as a file server. What would be considered a best practice for making the storage on the Linux box available to the windows clients on the network? It seems my options are: 

A lot of script simplification would be had if they are. EDIT: I should add these "processes" aren't daemons and don't actually record their PID in the FS anywhere ... 

Sorry if I'm teaching you to suck eggs, but are there other EXEs associated with the application (Do a search in all of its folders). That's normally the cause in my experience. You might also try using a path exception rather than hash rules. 

Is your Windows 7 machine configured to use your ADDS server as its DNS server? If so, can you ping the domain name? What I mean by this is, if the server is called MyDC.MyDomain.Com Then can you ping / resolve 

Your concerns are essentially correct - in a traditional Windows Server Remote Desktop Services, you have a shared estate. This isn't just an issue because of viruses, but you should remember that any user can impact everyone else on the box in a myriad of ways - CPU, RAM, Disk I/O and usage etc etc. There's no easy answer to all of these questions, though there are tools to mitigate. Back to your original question, though - the answer is to ensure you use A/V, take advantage of network based security and use tools such as group policy to lock down the user environment. I've worked with hundreds of terminal servers and, with the right precautions, viruses should be almost a non-issue. It's worth bearing mind the advantages to thin clients though. If you scale your infrastructure properly the users should never notice a server being taken out of production. Combine that with good DR practises and monitoring and the whole end to end repair could be totally transparent. 

I'm assuming I need to fiddle with either the file or to accomplish this. How can I instruct to avoid duplicate mountings? 

I tested fairly extensively with Ubuntu 10.04 Beta 2 Server in a VM, and was able to simply copy (read ) a cross compiled tool chain from an Ubuntu 8.10 VM. I created the tar myself, which is essentially a lot of stuff in . Now that I've got a bare metal installation of Ubuntu 10.04 proper, the copy isn't working. In particularly, I'm getting the error: 

I've got VMWare ESXi (the free version) machine that is booting off a 9650SE RAID-1 drive setup (two 1TB mirrored drives). I'd like to replace the 1TBs with 2TBs. Is there a safe way to do this? 

So, in other words, the default is the minimum you need to be able to enforce a password history. Now, personally, I don't think there is a valid security reason to enforce minimum password ages but there could be some practical / human reasons. For example, you may restrict the number of password changes to cut down on the number of "Forgot my password" calls. I could see this being practical for high school students, perhaps. Finally, it's worth bearing in mind that these limits do not apply to manual password resets from with Active Directory Users & Computers. So a user could always ask the Sysadmin for help if they really need to change their password. 

I think the answer you're looking for is "No". There are ways to redirect ports and so on, but ultimately, your client software has to make a request on a port, whether that be entered by the user or written into code or whatever. Either way, it's a client-side issue and you can't solve it server side. They aren't able to just make a request to an IP address in general. As an example, when you type serverfault.com to in your address bar, Internet Explorer is really going to serverfault.com:80 There's no magic here, it just makes the assumption that a website is going to be on port 80 as that's the official port. The developers could just have easily forced us to choose each time, but they opted to be nice. If the website was on port 81 for some reason the request would simply fail and you'd have to manually type serverfault.com:81 

I'm using Ubuntu 10.04 and have the directory setup as a BTRFS RAID 1 with two 2TB drives. I'd like to make the directory just a single drive; how do I safely go about doing this? 

I need to install an older version of gcc on Ubuntu 10.04 (Beta 2); and I'm told I can install a previous package. At present, I can't compile version gcc-3.3.x, and I'm looking to install a package. How do I instruct to pull stuff from previous Ubuntu archives? 

I have a cgi script that is resending an email on a failed attempt 5-10 minutes after a user accesses a page. My thought was to do this using the command from a python call (). Testing revealed: 

The next time I logged and tried to create a user, the default domain was still there. How can I change default doamin in an OTRS installation?
