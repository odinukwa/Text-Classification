If both 4500's having floodset on required interfaces. Temporary fix would be increase vlan aging time for exmaple: 

I'm setting up BFD on BGP between ASR1k and ASR9k. On 1k #show bfd neighbors details dosn't produce any output. Seems like BFD is not running. CPU Proccess running on 1k: BFD HW EVENT, BFD IPV6 ADDR, BFD Session creation BFD HA. We are using double tagging on sub-interface and vrf. any toughts what I'm missing? As per cisco configuration that should be easy to switch bfd on. 

Standard BTS (with 3 cells) can handle around 9 erlangs which is enough to support circa 1500 subscribers, but everything depends. All station are built to suit terrain and people density on given area. Is very difficult to say as you have not specified if those modems are 3G, GRPS or LTE. For example LTE with 2x20Mhz wide, 4x4Mimo and 64QAM could reach as much as Download ~300Mbps and ~80Mbps uplink. Not all modems have active connction all the time. Some connected send data some are in RRC-Idle. As well if there is mutliple devices they would share channel/bandwitch (stat-mux). Edit: So you are using modems as gateway for each meter to dial in? I'm pretty suprised as this solution is not scalable. I would say that much better would be to access destination servers over IP from GSM provider network, rather than dial-in into dedicated gateways. 

Is not gonna work as: 10.97.21.32/25 is part of 10.97.21.0/25 network which is overlapping with your 10.97.21.0/27 10.97.21.160/26 is part of 10.97.21.128/26 which is overlapping again with other of yours network. That should work: 10.97.21.0/25 10.97.21.128/26 10.97.21.192/27 10.97.21.224/27 

CIST Root Bridges Election Process When a switch boots up, it declares itself as CIST Root and CIST Regional Root and announces this fact in outgoing BPDUs. The switch will adjust its decision upon reception of better information and continue advertising the best known CIST Root and CIST Regional Root on all internal ports. On the boundary ports, the switch advertises only the CIST Root Bridge ID and CIST External Root Path Cost thus hiding the details of the region’s internal topology. CIST External Root Path Cost is the cost to reach the CIST Root across the links connecting the boundary ports – i.e. the inter-region links. When a BPDU is received on an internal port, this cost is not changed. When a BPDU is received on a boundary port, this cost is adjusted based on the receiving boundary port cost. In result, the CIST External Root Path Cost is propagated unmodified inside any region. Only a boundary switch could be elected as the CIST Regional Root, and this is the switch with the lowest cost to reach the CIST Root. If a boundary switch hears better CIST External Root Path cost received on its internal link, it will relinquish its role of CIST Regional Root and start announcing the new metric out of its boundary ports. Every boundary switch needs to properly block its boundary ports. If the switch is a CIST Regional Root, it elects one of the boundary ports as the “CIST Root port” and blocks all other boundary ports. If a boundary switch is not the CIST Regional Root, it will mark the boundary ports as CIST Designated or Alternate. The boundary port on a non regional-root bridge becomes designated only if it has superior information for the CIST Root: better External Root Path cost or if the costs are equal better CIST Regional Root Bridge ID. This follows the normal rules of STP process. As a result of CIST construction, every region will have one switch having single port unblocked in the direction of the CIST Root. This switch is the CIST Regional Root. All boundary switches will advertise the region’s CIST Regional Root Bridge ID out of their non-blocking boundary ports. From the outside perspective, the whole region will look like a single virtual bridge with the Bridge ID = CIST Regional Root ID and single root port elected on the CIST Regional Root switch. The region that contains the CIST Root will have all boundary ports unblocked and marked as CIST designated ports. Effectively the region would look like a virtual root bridge with the Bridge ID equal to CIST Root and all ports being designated. Notice that the region with CIST Root has CIST Regional Root equal to CIST Root as they share the same lowest bridge priority value across all regions. Have a look at the diagram below. It demonstrates the CIST topology calculated from the physical topology we outlined above. First, SW1-1 is elected as the CIST Root as it has the lowest Bridge ID among all bridges in all regions. This automatically makes region 1 a virtual bridge with all boundary ports unblocked. Next, SW2-1 and SW3-1 are elected as the CIST Regional Roots in their respective regions. Notice that SW3-1 and SW2-3 have equal External Costs to reach the CIST Root but SW3-1 wins the CIST Regional Root role due to lower priority. Keep in mind that in the topology with multiple MSTP regions, every region that does not contain the CIST Root has to change the IST Root election process and make IST Root equal to CIST Regional Root. source 

Mr. Robot IMHO Only while your DMVPN is part of your bigger network I can see point of doing summarization at hub. Unskilled summarization at hub could create many issues and pretty much destroy DMVPN for example you can break spoke to spoke traffic flow. While summarizing at hub you need to take into account split horizon and next hop for EIGRP. 

CAM and ARP table are populeted while you ping from 4500. Is just aging faster from CAM than from ARP. If you would wait 4 hours it would time out as well from ARP. Is those 4500 clustered? If yes I would say that VLAN is not getting to Active node for mac address population. All the request are coming to passive node and they are dropped. Maybe STP topology for particular VLAN is blocking state to Active node. I would compare STP topology of working vlan with not working one. Double check uplinks from access layer for this VLAN. Could be as well that VSL link between 4500 is not allowing particualr vlan. You need as well make sure that both 4500 have ports in this vlan. As well check floodset between 4500: 

Total = the total amount of memory available after the system image loads and builds its data structures. Used = the amount of memory currently allocated. Free = the amount of memory currently free. Lowest = the lowest amount of free memory recorded by the router since it was last booted. Largest = the largest free memory block currently available. 

It's NAT to outside interface. So all packets would be rewritten with IP assigned to outside interface. 

You don't need to use DHCP and staticly assigned IP addresses to machines. But in some networks like client access network that could be very difficult task to maintain is why we are using DHCP. Please below why you should use DHCP. 

"Open authentication", is fundamentally a NULL authentication where the client says "authenticate me", and the AP responds with "yes". Open authentication is the only method used in enterprise WLAN deployments, it is fundamentally a NULL authentication, Therefore, "real authentication" is achieved by using 802.1X/EAP authentication mechanisms. A typical secure enterprise WLAN AP blocks WLAN client traffic at the AP until a successful 802.1X authentication. That means that there is no verification of the user or machine. Open Authentication allows any device that places an authentication request to the access point (AP). Open Authentication uses clear-text transmission to allow a client to associate to an AP and therefore 802.1x could be used. 

There is a difference in syntax how NAT is configured on pre ASA v8.3 and newer versions. Please see examples below, or just use older version of ASDM matching your software on ASA. 

If you block UDP port 80 and 443 that should block QUCK. Of course you need have in place as well URL filter for youtube over TCP. 

Certificate with serial number: 3C1E27950000000C5C4B expired on 17 Jan 2017. Please double check certificates and configured trustpoints. It could be manufacturing installed certificates. I've found issue over here check if is not same in your case. 

Reflection A wireless signal is just radio waves. Just like light, it can bounce off of certain surfaces. Metal, for one, is a highly reflective material. This is a common occurrence for offices since they are generally in complex and intricately designed structures. If a large amount of reflection occurs, signals can be weakened and also cause interference at the receiver. Refraction Refraction is the bending of a wave when it enters a medium where the speed is different. For example, glass or water can refract waves. This can play into consideration when you’re carefully placing APs. Different media have different refractive indexes. It’s important to track possible refraction when designing your wireless network because if a signal changes direction in traveling from sender to receiver, this can cause lower data rates, high retries and lead to an overall lessening of capacity. Diffraction This is when waves encounter an obstacle and travel around it — the wave’s direction and intensity both change. In fact, diffraction can even be more pronounced or introduce a shadow zone depending on the size and shape of the obstacle. Hills are known to cause diffraction to wireless signals. Scattering While this phenomena is similar to refraction, it’s more unpredictable. Dust, humidity, unevenness and other qualities in a material can cause a signal to scatter in all directions. This can have a significant impact on signal integrity and strength. Chain-link fences and even smog are notorious for scattering RF signals. Absorption This is one of the most common reactions we see wireless signal have to materials. Basically, a material is converting the signal’s energy into heat. This occurs largely due to the molecules in the medium being unable to move fast enough to “keep up” with the RF waves that are trying to pass through it. 

Legally? Not. you should have a support contract for each device. But I don't think so that this is enforced in anyway. On April 13, 2017 there is End of Service Contract Renewal Date. And last date of support is: January 31, 2018. So I would suggest upgrade to 5506. More information you can obtain on this site: Order Services 

USG20 supports 1Gbps so I would connect to SG220 over one of two GigabitEthernet Ports which are usually used for uplinks next to port 0/23 and 0/24. Unfortunately USG20 doesn't support LCAP/PaGP so you won't be able to create bundle for redundancy purposes. But to be honest as @Ron Maupin said doesn't matter where exactly you will connect more likely your limited factor will be WAN. 

That's should be pretty much all. Don't have device on 8.2 to test it. You may want to check out this or this post. 

Is there any option for HP switches to change/modify used ssh ciphers? For exmaple in cisco we can issue commands: 

More likely in your case it would be QinQ or L2TP. More information you can find under this link: QinQ, QinQ-2 or juniper guide: here L2TP guide: L2TP and netscreen guide: netscreen 

There is few options you can do like disable beacon frame broadcast. Than you won't be able to discovery network SSID. But packets will be still sent and simple WiFi scan would find your network SSID. You can decrease TX/RC power to make it range shorter just to cover chosen area. Modification of frequency spectrum that WiFi client and AP is working on different than assigned frequencies (2.4, 5) but it would be more likely illegal to use different range. It as well not hiding your network but moving it to different frequency and with proper tools you would be able to see packets flowing. 

Both of clients hello have same content TLSv1.2, the difference in the labeling comes from the fact that in the first instance the negotiation doesn't complete, therefore wireshark labels both packets differently. In pcap files you can see that after client trying to establish SSL connection server replaying with RST, ACK packet. Than again client trying to establish another connection hello is labeled TLSv1.2. But again server is sending RST. Both hello are TLSv1.2 there is only difference how wireshark is labelling them. I would assume that server is misconfigured. I would suggest checking cipher suits used on server. Possibly the best way to troubleshoot this is by simply trying to connect to the server with openssl. openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 You should see what cipher is selected in this transaction (if it works at all). But this post is offtopic for this group. 

Is not gonna work that way unless you have stacked switches and ether channel/bundle or VPC configured on both switches to servers. Which not all switches support. Server usually don't take part in STP election. If you enable server to take part of STP election than you would have redundant links but at same time only 1 link would work and another would be in blocking state. 

I would say that this is how routers making forwarding decisions. If both of networks are advertised by same routing protocol administrative distance would be same. But smaller network /24 would be preffered so even router know how to reach 10.15.0.0/16 for any IP in network 10.15.208.0/24 would send it to data centre as it's more prefered. Implication is that network overlap and this could cause serious issues somewhere on the line.

Because 802.11a/b/n/g are standards defined on physical layer, framing staying same as in ethernet on above layers. Wireshark usually captures at the link layer so it's why you see Ethernet frames. Is how encapsulation work in OSI standard. Hope that picture below would help you to understand:
