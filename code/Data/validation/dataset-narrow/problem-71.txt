You need to open a case with Cisco TAC... obligatory Cisco Support Forums reference to a similar problem Without TAC support perhaps the best you can do is 

By default, routing protocols like OSPF or BGP won't re-route based on congestion unless the congestion makes them drop their routing protocol packets long enough to declare the neighbor down (on the order of 40 seconds to 120 seconds with default timers); the tricky issue here is that routing protocol packets are prioritized higher than other traffic in many vendors equipment. That means the circuit has to be really congested for that whole interval before the routing protocols will drop. 

What is the problem when you get ? Google searches turn up a lot of GNS3 discussion, and this Cisco Support Forums Case, but nothing gets to the root cause of the issue AFAICT. 

Signal strength is only one metric... also consider signal to noise ratio, which is often the problem for scenarios like this. Wifi latency and packet loss are cousins of each other. 802.11 frames contain a sequence number that is ACK'd... if the sequence number isn't ACK'd (due to loss or a bit error in the original frame), then the sender attempts to retransmit the frame a certain number of times. These 802.11 retransmissions show up as increased latency or outright packet loss if the interference is bad enough. I have literally seen 802.11g latency that is over 40 seconds (yes... seconds) when I'm only 50 feet from the LWAP. That particular environment had a lot of tools that also operated in the 2.4GHz bands, so obviously the potential for errors was quite high. 

For the sake of this question, I'm assuming that R1 uses a passive-interface to N2, and forms routing protocol adjacencies to R2 and R3 via N1. Assume PCs on N1 default through R1, which then issues ICMP redirects for the routes it learns from R2 and R3. You're trying to solve routing problems with ICMP redirects; however, ICMP redirects are the wrong way to solve routing problems. The right answer: GLBP I'm reading between the lines, but it looks like you're trying to load-balance outbound from N1 through multiple routers. The right way to solve this problem is with GLBP. GLBP is an improvement over HSRP because it automatically load-balances hosts on a subnet. Like HSRP, GLBP takes over for unreachable gateways if one goes down. There are also show commands directly on the router to understand which gateway is load-balancing a specific PC. Incidentally, there is GLBP for IPv6. The wrong answer: ICMP Redirects to different gateways 

Technically, you can change the timeout from 900 seconds to 300 seconds, since you're enabling loose session initiation on the service. F5 Solution Document 7595 is a good reference for forwarding virtual server configurations like this... see the section titled, "Emulating stateless IP routing with BIG-IP LTM forwarding virtual servers". 

VRFs dedicate a different forwarding table for each VRF; thus you can have dedicate an internet access provider for each Vlan, exactly as you described in your question. 

Background I am somewhere that blocks Dropbox downloads, so I can't see the captured traffic, but I'll go on the assumption these were 64-byte ethernet multicasts. Let's do some math to see how much traffic you're permitting... A 64-byte frame is 672 bits (including 8 bytes for Preamble/SFD, and 12 bytes for IFG)... 8*(8 + 12 + 64) = 672 bits That means line rate Gigabit Ethernet 64-bytes frames is about 1.488Mpps... (1000000000 / 672.0) = 1488095.24 pps What does this mean to you? Well your current storm-control configuration throttles traffic at 5% of line-rate, so you're allowing 74.4kpps of traffic to hit your switch before storm-control kicks in. 74.4kpps * 64-byte frames is 38Mbps, which is right at what your graphs show: $URL$ Answer So, the bottom line is that you're allowing too much traffic to hit the switch CPU, which is why the CPU utilization was high. 74.4kpps is really too much to allow any switch CPU to process. Assuming these stations shouldn't be sending a lot of multicast or broadast, the simple answer is to throttle your traffic like this... 

Does changing your name help if a thief is in your house? Re-addressing is the last thing I would think about in an intrusion. Are you assuming you found the intrusion? If so, then fix the hole the intruder came in and trust nothing. Hard drive firmware, keyboard firmware, almost anything is game if someone gets a good hold in your network. Hopefully you had backups on offline physical media (CD / DVD / tape) so you know what you can trust. Depending on the sophistication of the intruder there is no limit to what can be compromised; if they are nation / state-level actors even routers, switches, or firewall firmware can be hacked (see any number of compromises: BANANAGLEE, HALLUXWATER, JETPLOW, just to name a few). Quite honestly, if it's a state actor, you're just up a creek; you can't fight people like that. 

Your first problem is that you're using Cisco ASA commands on a Cisco router; you're also assuming this is a problem with your Cisco router. In reality, this is a DNS issue that can be solved with your Cisco router; however, it's normally solved with a split-DNS 

MTU 1504 and MTU 1500 within the same broadcast domain is simply a misconfiguration; it should never be expected to work any more than mismatched IP netmasks, or mismatched IP subnets can be expected to work. Your company will have to knuckle-down and fix the root-cause of the MTU mismatches... at this time it's hard to say whether the root cause is user error, an implementation bug, or some combination of the above. If the affected Windows machines are successfully logging into to an Active Directory Domain, one could write Windows login scripts to automatically fix MTU issues based on some well-constructed tests inside the domain login scripts (assuming the Domain Controller isn't part of the MTU issues). If the machines are not logging into a domain, manual labor is another option. Other possibilities to contain the damage Use a layer3 switchNote 1 to build a custom vlan for anything that has broken MTUs and set the layer3 switch's ethernet MTU to match the broken machines; this relies on PMTUD to resolve MTU issues at the IP layer. Layer3 switches generate the ICMP errors required by PMTUD. This option works best if you can re-address the broken machines with DHCP; and you can identify the broken machines by mac-address. 

is commonly used when aggregating routes downstream of an autonomous system; so the use case for an unordered list is bgp aggregation. EXAMPLE: In the example below, AS65500 aggregates the eBGP announcements from AS65000 and AS65001 into 10.1.0.0/23. After aggregating the announcements from AS65000 and AS65001, AS65500 sends and (the aggregate). Typically, an AS will aggregate when it has delegated portions of a larger address block to customers. It doesn't make sense to build an ordered list when you aggregate space for multiple ASNs; for instance, an ordered AS-PATH for the aggregate below would be either or . However, both of those ordered lists are non-sense because ordering is irrelevant to the aggregate (i.e. both autonomous systems are directly connected to AS 65500). Ordering implies a sequence which is meaningless to the aggregate. Unordered lists (i.e. mathematical sets) make the most sense for an AS_SET. 

Use , and on each switchport. Root guard is unnecessary on ports with this configuration, because bpduguard will err-disable the port when you receive any bpdus. Use root guard on links to other switches, which are not planned for the primary or secondary stp root role. 

1. First we have to find how many packets per second of PPPoE you're sending when you measured the download speed. Given the assumption of 300Kbps (1452-byte TCP payloads) in the question, calculate the PPPoE packets per second (pps)... 

Now graph out how much traffic you're seeing every few seconds vs drops; if you see massive spikes in policy drops or overruns when your traffic spikes, then you're closer to finding the culprit. Don't forget that you can sniff directly on the ASA with this if you need help identifying what's killing the ASA... you have to be quick to catch this sometimes. 

I am in the middle of a project to migrate some existing switched ethernet dot1q trunks behind an ASA firewall... these trunks have five vlans each (numbered 51 - 55). This is a simple drawing of the original layer2 service... 

If you have enough DRAM / Flash, I would go with the latest 12.2 for the Cisco3620... that's 12.2(26c)GD... FYI, the image will fit on 32M DRAM and 8M flash... avoid 12.2T if possible. As we discussed in comments, load it on a PCMCIA with another 3600 and sneakernet. 

Original way to change Cisco IOS ACLs Originally, the safest way to change your ACL was by removing it from the interfaces in question (this prevented problems if you were changing the ACL via the same interface it was applied to). Use this technique if your IOS doesn't support IP access-list line numbering: 

MSC-B draws a little more power than MSC-A, but they are similar in functionality. The FP40 doesn't have as much buffering as the MSC cards, and it doesn't have the top-end PPS switching speed that the MSC cards do.

Per-packet load-balancing forces the router to round-robin traffic between destinations. You should never use this is a production network without considering the consequences (most often, reordering packets... which makes VoIP / video, and sometimes TCP unhappy). Per-packet load-balancing is great in the lab, and usually unwise in production, unless you're in a very specific situation and know what you're doing. Per-packet load-balancing also has very spotty platform support... some Cisco routers (such as the Catalyst 6500 Sup720) simply won't use per-packet load-balancing. 

Again we see that (aside from static configuration), one should set the Forwarding State bit "only if the forwarding state has indeed been preserved for that address family during the restart". 

Please use 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255, per RFC 6890, page 6. I used to think that answering historical questions was a good idea, but I would like to avoid doing this on a regular basis, due to bad help vampire experiences. It doesn't seem necessary in this case. 10.0.0.0/8 is simple enough. 

As discussed in chat, PBX / SIP traffic is unique to an IP host route in your case. Therefore, you can remove PBR and use tracking objects on overlapping static routes, which go out different interfaces to solve the problem. 

Take note of the line numbers that Cisco automatically added to ACL 110. Remember that you need to add your ACL entries before line 50, due to the deny statement. Step 2, Modify ACL 110 in place with new entries, starting after line 40: 

Basic Config As others have mentioned, your configuration is "suboptimal"... the biggest problem you have is that you're not using DHCP on the outside Vlan interface the biggest problem is that your default gw address is assigned to Vlan2... to recover, login to the console and... 

Assume your internal Webhost address is 10.1.1.50 and you're using 192.0.2.2 (a second address given by your ISP) for your public A-record.. Thus, when you resolve "ourdomain.com" from google's resolver, you get... 

The problem occurs when PC1's traffic returns via R2. Assume the iSCSI session starts at 8:00:00, and both routers and both switches learn PC1's mac simultaneously. Between 8:00:00 and 8:00:05, there are no flooding problems because both switches still have PC1's mac-address in their CAM table. 

First, I apologize for not including this dependency... The MIB tables you're polling are indexed by a value. In this case, you're polling (which shows up as iso.3.6.1.2.1.17.4.3.1.2, if you don't have the BRIDGE-MIB loaded). That OID is indexed by a mac-address. Therefore, 0.20.42.49.139.235 is the mac-address in dotted-decimal format... To see the results you expect, you need to get the v2 mibs from Cisco's FTP site: 

I also found a pretty good blog post on autoinstall If you're looking for a tool to perform Autoinstall, check out freeztp; it's written in Python and uses a series of commands to set up configurable templates for IOS routers and switches. Thank you for asking about this feature, I completely forgot it existed.
