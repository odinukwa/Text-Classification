BGP is very scalable and can be configured easily (however to be able to troubleshoot, you need to know BGP indepth). It is used on a global scale by ISP's as well. To calculate the routing path, BGP uses a few variables and not just a metric or number of paths. So this should be more accurate. Even if you want to set up a backup path, this can be done simply by adding the same AS number over and over in the path... . The routing table can handle large amounts of entry's as well. If you want further information, I do suggest you take the CNNP BGP course. It's very good, but a lot to put in one post of course :) 

A normal (layer 2) switch sends frames from one port (in) to another port (out) based on the destination MAC address in the frame. It wil search its MAC table 

the 1 bits in the address are the network part of the address, this cannot be used for assigning hosts. In this example, you can use 9 bits for the hosts (minus 2 hosts, reserved for the broadcast and network address).In the /23 you have, you can use: 

It means from point A to point B in the network and everything in between (in this context) ex: PC (A)=> switch => router => router => switch => PC (B) 

I'm fairly certain that when the router forwards the DHCP request it includes only the primary network configured on the interface. I don't believe there's any way to have it use the secondary network. Edit: I did some Googling and determined what others have already pointed out, there's a feature called smart-relay that can use the secondary network, but only after the primary times out three times. The relevant quote from Understanding and Troubleshooting DHCP in Catalyst Switch or Enterprise Networks - Cisco Systems 

We generally don't do it because of the messiness and lack of security. One VLAN = one subnet is easier to document and easier to troubleshoot and there's usually not a good reason to complicate things. The only reason I can think of to do it is company mergers or network upgrades and for both of those I'd prefer it to be temporary. Edit to clarify, for the hosts on different subnets but the same VLAN to talk directly you'd need to either make them their own default gateway or add a route to the "other" subnet that connects it to the interface. In the gateway case if the host IP was 10.1.1.2 then the gateway would also be 10.1.1.2. This will cause the host to ARP for everything on or off it's subnet. This would allow it to talk to the second subnet on that VLAN but the only way it'll be able to talk to anything else is if there's a router/firewall running proxy arp that can help it out. In the route out the interface case you'd add something like "route add -net 192.56.76.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0" to the device and then 10.1.1.2 will ARP directly on eth0 when it wants to reach 192.56.76.*. 

Wikipedia is your friend: LAN: A local area network (LAN) is a computer network that user interconnects computers in a limited area such as a home, school, computer laboratory, or office building using network media. In simple words, what unifies devices on one LAN: they are situated in the same area. Most commonly, one LAN is behind one router (not talking about backup routers and redundancy routers). WAN: A wide area network (WAN) is a network that covers a broad area (i.e., any telecommunications network that links across metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries) using private or public network transports. Again, in simple words: a WAN connection is connecting LAN's over a bigger area. Example: LAN + internet/network + LAN = WAN (when talking about bigger area's) 

The routing between these subnets will be handled by the L3 switch. so if pc 0 wants to ping to pc 1: PC0 > (gets it on his vlan 1 port) switch 1 (trunk) > switch 0 (trunk) > switch 2 (trunk) > L3SW (vlan1 > vlan2) (sends it out of its trunk port) > switch 2 (trunk) > switch 0 (trunk) > switch 1 (vlan2) > pc1 

The switch receives it and since there is no tagging will threat it as if it was on VLAN 2 (in your example). So if it receives a broadcast on this port, it will forward it out of all ports configured with VLAN 2 (still untagged doh). 

I think the answer is that switches don't care about VLANs in other switches. The boundaries created by a VLAN only apply on that switch. In this case it sounds like an access port on VLAN 10 in the core switch is plugged into an access port in either VLAN 20 or 30 in the switch with the ACE. Since they're access ports there's no tagging and while I would consider that a misconfiguration and "wrong" it will work just fine as a way to bridge VLAN 10 and the other VLAN. Since VLANs 20 and 30 are bridged explicitly by the ACE that makes all three VLANs into one broadcast domain. You might think of the VLANs as ethernet hubs. Each VLAN is a hub, a broadcast domain. The bridge statement in the ACE connects the 20 and 30 "hub" and turns them into one domain so they can see each other. There is obviously something connecting 10 into the one of the others as well but there isn't enough info to know what. Probably it's an access port with each end in a different VLAN or it's a trunk port with "mismatched" default VLAN. Bonus info because hubs aren't common anymore: In the olden days people used hubs for ethernet connections (when they weren't hiding from dinosaurs). Computers were plugged into hubs and each hub was a broadcast domain (and a collision domain but we're not going there). VLANs didn't exist so each hub was it's own domain and computers plugged into hub 20 couldn't see other computers that were plugged into hub 30 unless the two hubs were connected by running a cable between them (a crossover cable because MDIX didn't exist yet). 

you should check out VRRP or HSRP (when using Cisco) $URL$ $URL$ In a nutshell: 2 routers will check availability, when the main disconnects, the backup takes over. These routers need to be in the same subnet doh, using 1 IP per router and 1 shared IP. This shared IP is your default gateway. 

ARP spoofing is just the thing that is doing the multiple MAC's for one IP. :) So if you want to avoid duplicate adresses... stop ARP spoofing (poisoning) your network. If you want to understand this, read the following page: $URL$ 

In your sheme you need 3 trunk links (if there is only one physical connection between these switches): 

I think the problem is the encryption used for wireless connected devices. This is probably possible, when not using any encryption. (not recommended, and be sure you only test this on your own network, otherwise, in most countries, this is considered illegal.) 

You can set up the basic Zenoss monitoring server, it's supports Cisco Devices information gathering via SNMP. This provides a lot of information just by adding an IP (like: IOS version, interfaces + IP configuration, ...) 

everything before the "|" is the network area, that cannot be changed in this subnet. Everything after, you can use for your hosts, except the all-0's and all-1's. This is clear if you put the subnetmask under it. You can calculate everything here (and on other sites): $URL$ 

On IOS you can enter control-v to escape the next character. This lets you enter a question mark without pulling up help. Don't if that works on ASA but might be worth a try. 

I can't speak to Option 43 being ignored but can you put in a DNS entry for CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.domain-given-by-dhcp and point it at 10.19.3.209? That should let them unicast to the controller. 

Both have VSAT options that involve a lot of "spoofing" similar to what Riverbed does on the WAN. They'll terminate the TCP connection at the earth-terminal on each end to make the client think things are faster than they are. 

To my knowledge (which is not advanced) directionality is generally a function of the antenna so I suppose that you could use separate transmit and receive antennas such that one could be directional and the other omnidirectional. Another alternative would be beamforming, which is a signal-processing technique that seems to be simulating directionality in software. 

No. The native VLAN on a trunk means that: A) Any untagged frame arriving on the trunk will be treated as being in the native VLAN (regardless of what VLAN it was in on the sending switch). B) Frames on the native VLAN will cross the trunk untagged. In your example a frame arriving on the default VLAN (VLAN 1) will be forwarded out the trunk port on VLAN 1. Since VLAN 2 is the native VLAN that means the frame on VLAN 1 will be tagged. The only way a layer-2 switch will ever move a frame from one VLAN to another is if something is misconfigured. You could misconfigure it intentionally but in my opinion it would still be wrong.
