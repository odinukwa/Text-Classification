The datasheet for the S12-600 suggests it has the 24-pin ATX main power connector, but it has a 4-pin ATX 12V power connector and an 8-pin EPS 12V power connector. Will I be able to use my existing PSU to power this board, or am I going to have to replace it? I've seen discussion (e.g. on Tom's hardware) that an EPS 12V cable can be used with an ATX 12V power connector, is that right? Many thanks for any and all help! UPDATE: Reading around more, I've come to the conclusion that the connector is pin and voltage compatible with the socket on the board. I was confused by the 8-pin connector being called an EPS 12V. I took that to mean it wasn't compatible with ATX, as opposed to what it actually means (which is that its inclusion is in accordance with the EPS standard). A nice summary of the PSU/motherboard compatibility can be found here. I'm going to accept Wil's answer, since it provides the same conclusion that I've come to independently. 

Does anybody know if there's a keyboard shortcut equivilant to the right click -> New context menu in explorer? Given that I suspect that there isn't, does anybody know of an explorer extension that offers something similar? It would be great to have a key combination that yielded an intellisense style dropdown (or similar) of the available file types! 

As an alternative, you could try out gSyncit. I can confirm it works on Windows 7 x64, and it already supports both flavours (x32 and x64) of Outlook 2010. 

If you click on the settings button within the podcast section of iTunes, you can specify the behaviour when it detects new podcasts are available. It sounds like you have it set to the "Download the most recent one" option, when you want "Download all". Once they're downloaded, that should also solve the issue of syncing as well. 

If you use Control Panel to install IIS, you get the default installation, which has a minimum set of features. If you need additional IIS features, such as Application Development Features or Web Management Tools, make sure to select the check boxes associated with those features in the Windows Features dialog box. 

If you want a (free) solution that integrates into Visual Studio, you could give AnkhSVN a try. I've used it successfully before now, and the only reason I don't use it is that I prefer tortoise. 

You should be able to download the Offline installer from here. For some reason it seems that Google don't expose the ?standalone=1 version of the download link on their own pages. EDIT: Alternatively you could try Softpedia. It has a mirror link for each of the different versions you might want. 

You might like to take a look at the iReader Chrome extension. It will support multi-page articles, and there's a version available for Firefox as well. 

I do exactly the same. If you right click on a folder, then select properties, there is a check box that says "Check this folder for new messages". That's the one you want! Unfortunately I don't think there is any way to do this for all folders at once, you have to do them one by one. 

Yes, from technet: To Install IIS 7.5 on Windows 7 You can perform this procedure using the user interface (UI) or a script. Using the UI 

I had the same issue, it turns out that podcasts were set to disabled in the Parental Control section of Preferences. 

I recently came across a tool which will take a list of email addresses, and attempt to cleanse it of the nonsense addresses that people use when wanting to download/sign up for something without receiving the resulting emails (e.g. asdf@asdf.com). The tool in question was Email Validation Tool by Softsea. It first rules out spurious email domains by performing a DNS lookup, and then can also go on to connect to the appropriate SMTP server to ask it whether the mailbox in question actually exists. Unfortunately I was not able to configure the tool correctly in order to get this second step to work, as I could not understand what configuration data it needed (it asked for an SMTPID?). My question is this: Can anybody recommend/share their experience of a slightly more user friendly tool to achieve this? or failing that point out where I'm going wrong with this one in particular!? The tool wouldn't need to be free, but I'm looking for one that is pretty straight forward to use. 

Can you confirm that the port ranges you mentioned are all present in the list when you edit the File and Printer Sharing entry, and that their scopes are all set to Any? Update: If you go to "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security" by clicking "Advanced Settings" from the left hand column on the Firewall homepage in Control Panel, you may be able to find the rule in question and edit its scope from there. Update 2: Just seen your new screenshot, can you not change the rule from the other tabs? They both sound potentially useful! 

It may not hit every point on your list, but I use an Apple Airport Express to achieve the same goal. 

I've never used it, but the GMail Manager addon for Firefox may help you to do this. Not sure about IE though. EDIT: This obviously only helps if the application in question is GMail though! 

This solutions obviously needs iTunes as the serving software, but if your server machine is always on then I'd suggest you leave it running on that. This would also get around the Wake from sleep issue. Update You may be able to use Salling Clicker as the remote on your phone (though I haven't tried it myself). There's a free trial which may be worth a look. 

Click Start and then click Control Panel. In Control Panel, click Programs and then click Turn Windows features on or off. In the Windows Features dialog box, click Internet Information Services and then click OK. 

You could add a search column that is searching for your Twitter handle. That will show replies etc. But the downside is that it will only show tweets as far back as Twitter Search will return them. 

Firebug Lite now exists as a native Chrome extension. It has some limitations, but I much prefer it to the bookmarklet and hopefully the missing functionality will come in time. Now we just need the plugins as well :D 

Like a lot of people (or at least I imagine), I have iTunes set to sync all unplayed podcasts episodes to my iPhone, and also to delete the ones I have listened to. This obviously has the benefit that I don't clog up my hard drive with old episodes that I'm never likely to listen again, and I only have new episodes to choose from when I'm picking something to listen to. I use iTunes on my home PC, but I'm almost always at work when I'm listening to podcasts. Since we have WiFi at work, if I become aware that a new episode has come out (via a blog post or whatever) I tend to just pick it up immediately, using the "get more episodes" link from within the podcast in question. However I can't do this if I don't happen to have another episode of that same podcast already on the iPhone, as the "get more episodes" link obviously doesn't exist. I appreciate that I can still go via the iTunes store, and indeed thats what I end up doing, but I'd much prefer it if there was some way to have the iPod app display all of my subscriptions, regardless of whether there is currently an episode on the iPhone. I fear I know the answer, but does anybody know of any way to have it do this? Alternatively, is there better way around this than just keeping old episodes around? 

If you've just updated to 1.6.8 (as I have), you might have to do a repair install to fix the icon overlay issue. As detailed on the TortoiseSVN blog here. 

If it returns 'DisableDeleteNotify = 0' then TRIM is enabled. 2 - The pagefile is used to provide Virtual Memory in the eventuality that you run out of available RAM. As such, as soon as your system begins using it it will be reading and writing to it quite a lot. From the point of view of Windows, its great to have the pagefile on an SSD because its much quicker than running virtual memory from a magnetic HDD. More details can be found over at the Engineering Windows 7 Blog. From the point of view of your hard drive however, you will be reading and writing to the same section of disk often, which doesn't help its longevity. Depending on what you intend to use your machine for will somewhat dictate the approach you take. If you're going to be running lots of memory intensive apps, and filling your 6 (or 12) GB of RAM then you're going to be using the pagefile quite a lot. There's a good discussion thread on neowin about the different approaches to this issue. Personally, since I don't use up lots of RAM during my day-to-day use, I moved the pagefile off my SSD onto a fast HDD (Spinpoint F3) and have never seen any performance issues. One final point is that some applications will refuse to launch if it cannot find a pagefile. Even if you never get anywhere near filling up your RAM its prudent to keep at least a small pagefile around to prevent these apps from complaining. 3 - You should get pretty dam good performance with that spec, so other than the standard advice (don't install crapware, run antivirus software, always update your drivers etc etc), you shouldn't need to do much to get good performance out of this machine. That said, there are plenty of sites out there full of advice on specific topics (e.g. this one), so if you have particular performance concerns there's almost certainly an answer out there for you, or somebody here that will know the answer :) 

Another benefit of having your media properly categorised is when it comes to using shuffle during playback. Before I moved my audiobook rips out to the audiobook section, if I decided to just hit shuffle for some random songs from my library, I'd often get random audiobook chapters in amongst the music. Though I don't have any, I can imagine that the same would also be true of any iTunes U content, etc. 

Now that bookmark sync has made it up into the beta channel, I'm trying out Chrome a little more seriously. I'd like to know whether, whenever I middle-click on a link/bookmark to open it in a new tab, there's an option to immediately switch focus to that tab? If not then is there an extension that can add this behaviour? Update: Just realised that extensions are not enabled in v4 beta. Update 2: Extensions arrived on the beta channel, tabs to the front is now doing its job nicely :) 

One interesting workaround for this problem, whilst we're stuck waiting for tasks API, is to use Bryan Clark's Google Calendar Tab. As long as you have your tasks displayed on your Google calendar, you will then have access to them from Thunderbird too. Obviously this isn't as good as native integration into Thunderbird via an API, but its the best I've managed so far. 

For use with Eclipse, you could try Subclipse. I haven't used it myself however, so I don't know its pros and cons! 

Your machine may support it, but not have that support enabled. If your CPU supports hardware assisted virtualization, there will be a switch in the BIOS that will enable it. What CPU does your system have? If its an AMD CPU, it will support hardware assited virtualization unless its a Sempron. If its an Intel CPU, then finding it on the following page will tell you whether or not it should support hardware assisted virtualization: $URL$ UPDATE: If you have it, the BIOS option may not be immediately obvious. On an AMD based machine it may be called "AMD-V", or on an Intel machine it may be called "Intel VT-x". If you don't have an option called "hardware assisted virtualization" look for some variant on the above two names. UPDATE 2: Following your comment, it looks like you won't be able to enable the virtualization support without changing your CPU :(
