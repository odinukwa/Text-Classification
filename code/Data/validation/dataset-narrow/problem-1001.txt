I have created DNSSEC records for my domain using an old guide from serverfault.com [ $URL$ ] and I would now like to add my DNSSEC details to my domain registrar's records, but I am a bit stuck on what to put where in their table. Keytag: I have a keyid in my public key file, so would this be it? Algorithm: I know this to be 5. Digest Type: I know this to be RSASHA1. Digest: Not sure: I have tested various strings from the files, where I could be sure that the strings were public, not private, but I keep on seeing the same error: ERROR: Parameter value range error Can anyone enlighten me on this, please? ... Ready for Confusion link: $URL$ 

This is no longer necessary, as it is all now pre-configured (for the basic indexing and fancy indexing, at least), with an IndexOptions block for the addition of further configuration options. 

The DNS (BIND server) appears to be working fine ...with exception to the reverse zones. dig @10.200.0.6 insurgent.info. 

Further to an earlier, and similar problem, I have also experimented with options single-request and single-request-reopen in the resolv.conf file, neither of which has been successful in enabling me to view the website. DNS: named.conf (and, yes, there is a RNDC key in the file on my server): 

After several tests, and several hours of my website remaining up and available to me (not just the rest of the internet!), I am inclined to think that the problem I was experiencing was, indeed, caused by my BIND nameserver trying to simultaneously return records from both IPv4 and IPv6 when I was trying to browse the site. As stated on: $URL$ the solution given for Hostname lookup delayed with IPv6, that being adding options single-request to the resolv.conf file, does work (for me, at least). Note: this amendment will occasionally be removed, especially following system updates. Use of the following, as the root user, should prevent this from happening, but may cause NetworkManager to produce errors: chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf //to set the read-only attribute chattr -i /etc/resolv.conf //to remove the read-only attribute ...followed by: systemctl restart network.service 

Not quite: there is (on Cent OS / RHEL / Red Hat / Fedora, at least) a nasty gotcha in the form of /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf. - The Options -Indexes entry needs to be amended to either Options Indexes or Options +Indexes, otherwise the indexing will not work and there will be a client denied by server configuration: /var/www type error in the log file. 

Problem: Unable to connect either locally or remotely to my website, whether with the domain name or via the IP addresses, and with timeout or server unavailable error message when trying to connect. Attempts to view the site remotely ( ipv6proxy.net and quirktools.com ) confirm that there is no remote access to port 80 (site neither visible or accessible). I do, of course, realise that the port conflict could be down to the ports being open locally, with remote access blocked for some reason. Configuration: Windows PC with Windows 7 x64, Linux laptop with Fedora Server Edition 27, and Draytek 2760n router, with all website browsing via the Windows machine. The two machines are configured to be part of a VLAN. The adapters on the Windows machine have been left with automatic configuration, whilst the Fedora adapter has been configured with two static IPv4 addresses and five static IPv6 addresses. The two IPv4 addresses have been added directly to the adapter, whilst the IPv6 addresses are part of the /64 PPP subnet used by the router to enable IPv6 access. I have tried removing the VLAN configuration, and can confirm that removing it did not make any difference at all, ie: still completely unable to access the website, whether by domain name or IP address (both IPv4 and IPv6). Ports: nmap shows that both ports 53 and 80 are open, but online port checkers ( eg: ipv6scanner.com ) report that both ports are closed or stealthed; however, I know from a previous incarnation of my website, that this site is accurate and that the ports would be shown as open if the website was resolving properly. Output of netstat -tlnp : 

I don't know how to do from command line, but 7zip has an easy to use wrapper DLL for C#, "SevenZipSharp", which allows you to create archives or unpack them. And in the same program you could test the content of the folders in which you unpacked the data. Let me know if you need code samples. 

I have a put a border/frame around a text paragraph, that spans over 3 pages. It is a code sample. The frame has a vertical line at the top of the paragraph on the first page, then 2 vertical lines at the sides of the paragraph also on the first page, and then an unwanted horizontal line inside the paragraph at the end of the 1st page. So, the frame is closed at the end of this page, although the code sample continues on the next. Same procedure at the 2nd page, it starts with the horizontal frame line, although the paragraph has started at the previous page. Using a 1-cell table is not an option either, it also has the unwanted horizontal lines at page ends/beginnings. Is there any option to avoid the closing of the frame at page ends and "reopening" at page beginnings? I only want the vertical lines as long as the paragraph has not ended. 

Ports 8000 and 8080 often are used for Proxy server functionality. Maybe you have ICS (Internet connection sharing) or something similar enabled that is blocking this port. You should also check if maybe falsely two instances of your server are running. 

The shutdown command DOES work, but you need to enable it on the target Computer. Therefore search the Internet for "remote shutdown token filter policy". Secondly you need to authenticate on the remote Computer in order to be allowed to execute the showdown. The shutdown command does not provide a functionality to transmit logon credentials, so you need to send them on a different way before doing the shutdown. I suggest you map a network drive for that purpose. Works well for me. You don't need to create a network share on the target just for that, use IPC$ instead. Notice: you need to logon on the target with credentials of the target Computer! The local rights of these credentials are not relevant; the target user may not even exist locally. AND the target user must have sufficient privileges to shut down the target. 

DGS-1008a is a Fast Ethernet Switch. Fast Ethernet does not have Auto-MDIX, which would swap pins if a crossover cable would be needed where a straight cable is installed, or vice versa. If the other switch also hasn't Auto-MDIX, they cannot connect if the wrong cable is used, or the cable is falsely connected to the sockets in your wall installed in your wall. Your computer very likely has a GBE port. The have become standard years ago. Your computer is therefore able to switch pins if needed. What is the 16port switch? It is a GBE switch, thus it should have Auto-MDIX, but maybe it doesn't. Try a crossover cable between wall socket and DGS switch. 

...causes the default Apache placeholder webpage to be displayed, as does simply removing the index page. I should also mention that what I am trying to achieve is an index view of my web-directory in order to avoid having to implement a mess of linked pages. - The website is intended as a resource site, so visitors can simply move directly to the page or the resouce that they want with no messing around. Also, at this point, FancyIndexing is not absolutely essential, as I should be able to 'upgrade' to that once I have indexing working. ======================================================================= This is additional to my comments, and is in further reply to Anaksunaman's answer, with my own notes and observations: 

Has anyone here managed to get FancyIndexing working in Apache 2.4? - I have found plenty of guides, but they are all at least 5-9 years out of date and do not work with Apache 2.4. According to the documentation, FancyIndexing comes under mod_autoindex (which is enabled by default), and all that is required to get it working on a most basic level is Options +Indexes in a directory block, like so: 

Just tonight I have been working on my webserver and suddenly found that I no longer had access to my website (which had been working just fine that very evening). After a lot of messing-around with testing and diagnostics, none of which were able to confirm an actual error, I switched the IPv6 DNS of 2620:0:ccc::2 and 2620:0:ccd::2 to 2001:4860:4860::8844 and 2001:4860:4860::8888 (from OpenDNS to Google) and, lo and behold(!), my website returned. Looking through the posts on the forum, and the internet in general, I can see that there are a lot of OD problems with that service (eg: $URL$ and wondered if this was one of them, or if it simply does not like my website for some reason? For the curious: my website webpage is: insurgent.info. It is basic, the navigation is lousy non-existent, treehuggers are cantankerous (or, at least, this one is) and, yes, this question probably should be somewhere it isn't. ========================================================================= Update 16.05.18: the problem definitely is not just DNS service related: just today I had to change the IPv6 service three times (my IPv4 DNS is covered by my ISP, via a DNSSEC-secured IPv4 client-resolver), and each time I was able to browse my webpage once, maybe twice at most, before all my attempts were timing out. The problem got so bad this evening that I was not even able to use my laptop for updates, installing packages, or anything at all involving the internet. I absolutely do not understand what is happening, as the logs for named and httpd are showing no problems what-so-ever, and both the laptop and the Windows PC are using the same router, with no attacks or other issues in the logs. I do not have a firewall on the laptop because there is a very comprehensive firewall, and DoS Defence, on the router; plus I have no ports open to the internet except those that have to be, and MySQL has remote connections disabled. I know for a fact that the website is visible to other people, - the only person who is unable to browse the website is myself; ie: it would appear to be only connections from my fixed IPv4 address and IPv6 subnet which are being blocked, either through a configuration issue or some kind of (automatic?) blacklist on the DNS service side. Has anyone got any ideas on this, please, as I am completely out of ideas on what else could possibly be causing this issue? 

Afaik, if you create a FTP share, then you can set the user rights only per share, but not per subfolder. That is because the FTP server usually has no control over the shared content (files, subfolders). You'd have to apply additional user rights e.g. from the operating system, but they cannot be combined with FTP, because all FTP users are given the OS user acoount rights under which the FTP server runs. Conclusion: it's not possible in the way you try to do it. But you could for example create another FTP share, which targets the subfolder directly, and give it different user rights, which are those that you want for this subfolder. 

You could check on the target computer, which user account was used to create the connection. There's a Windows tool , try that. 

Now we start READING the book. You want to know the items on your shopping list. The TOC tells you to go to page 16. You start reading until you reach the bottom of p.17. Done. Next: you want to see how the supermarket looks like where you want to go shopping. The TOC tells you to go to p.11 (you are on p.18 (= end of p.17) and have to browse 7 pages back. On a hard disk the read-write head needs to do a jump. Then you start reading until you reach end of p.15, then you browse to p.18 (head jumps again) and continue. Browsing in a book takes less time than reading, but on a hard-disk it's almost the other way round. The head cannot just move to the next track/cylinder, but has to 'search' the correct cylinder (acceleration, motion, deceleration, settling time). See Wikipedia. So due to fragmentation your reading takes longer than if the file was stored consecutively. And now, we do READING WITH 2 PEOPLE: You want to see the supermarket image and I want to read your text A. You browse to page 11 and start reading. When you have read p.11, I browse to p.1 and start reading. When I have read. p.1, you browse to p.12 and continue reading. When you have read. p.12, I browse to p.2 and continue reading. ... you can imagine that it takes a lot longer to read the pages just because the many browsing takes so long. Same with your hard-disk. You can't do nothing about it but avoiding simultaneous access as this always makes it slower. Now, finally, the YES answer: YES: Buy a SSD. This is a electronic disk and it operates like RAM, so you have almost no seek times and the total throughput is always close to the maximum possible throughput (if there are no other bottlenecks elsewhere). 

Hopefully this is sufficient information to make my question a worthwhile challenge for someone; for myself, I have no further ideas at present, so suggest what you will (within reason) because this problem, having previously had the website up and running, simply makes no sense at all to me. 

DHCP: I briefly managed to gain access to the website via 2a00:b900:10a4:1::a after turning-off DHCP6 IPv6 auto-ranging in the router configuration; but this just gives me the usual timeout or server unavailable error now, and only worked to give me the website output for the IPv6 addresses (any of them, nameserver and AAAA); not the IPv4 addresses. I also tried turning-off DHCP (IPv4 addressing side), but that just messed-up my sshd, and had to be re-enabled. Firewall: There is no firewall, or iptables, on the Linux machine. I also ensured that IPv6 routing packets were not blocked in the router configuration, and tried completely disabling all firewall-related configuration, too, in addition to completely removing the firewall on the Windows machine during my tests. Logs: The timeout and server unavailable browse errors have left no entries either in the named or httpd log files. IP Addresses: To the best of my knowledge, the IP addresses have been added correctly to the adapter files on the Linux machine, and resolv.conf has been locked with chattr +i . ifconfig shows that all the IPv6 addresses are available to the adapter, but not the IPv4 addresses for some reason; although the IPv4 addresses can be viewed via ip addr show or nmcli: 

I am having a problem with my website absolute basic HTML page. The nameservers are delegated to the majority of servers, including the AAAA address for the site, ports 53, 80, and 443 are all open to inbound and outbound traffic, the BIND DNS server is set to be authoritative, Apache is the HTTPD server, and there is one domain in the mix: insurgent.info [ 2a:00:b900:10a4:1::a ]...but I have been unable to find a single test your webpage from other geo-location, or mobile emulator, site actually able to view, or even access, the webpage (several actually report configuration errors but, frustratingly, do not give any further details); although my HTTPD logs show that googlebot has visited the page on at least 3 occasions. I have also carried-out the usual named-checkconf, named-checkzone, apachectl status, HTTPD error log checks and found absolutely nothing indicating a problem. Could someone try to visit the site, please (or just send a bot if you think this is some kind of scam =] ), because I absolutely cannot see what is causing the problem, if there actually is a problem, or if my domain simply needs more time to delegate. Further to the helpful comments I have received on this subject I have just managed to find a website that may be of use to other people with a similar problem: $URL$ .
