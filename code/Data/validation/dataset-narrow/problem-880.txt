You don't have because powershell searchs this property in your custom object which you create with New-. If you want to retrieve in this object you must modify to have : 

You haven't open the port UDP 53 which is the port for the DNS requests from your client to your DNS server. EDIT1 : 

In your icinga2 configuration you must activate the performance data and select the broker (the soft which will treat yours performances datas sent by your check). icinga2.conf for example : 

But now, I'm blocked and i don't know to resolve this problem, have you got an idea of that ? Thanks, EDIT Well, today the service is running : 

In your position, i would launch performances measurements with the windows tool performances monitor You will be able to see what process use yours disks and/or use your network ressources. You can launch a test just after a reboot and during a long time. I always record performances measures during several weeks. EDIT : If you can, you would launch the perfmon during the high latencies events. Because, if you launch before and if the responsible process is not yet started, it will not be loggued in the counters. others questions : 

Because the block size of your hard drive is 512 bytes. And if you do 34x512 you will have 17408 bytes the size on your file system. And the IO block is the index of your block not his size 

The NIC of your machine resend the STP-keepalive to his connected port. So the switch close this port. Maybe, the loop can come from two interfaces installed on your machine which can be plugged on your switch. The interfaces can be virtualized interfaces of a virtualization software and misconfigured. Or the interface of your machine can be configured in a specific mode which resend all his received traffic. It would be interesting to see your traffic with tcpdump or wireshark when you plug your NIC on the switch. 

The start (or the error) will be logged in the window events log. So you don't need to add a event trigger to survey the starting state of the first task. Now, the main problem of the task scheduler is when your task starts normally but the executed script has an error or generate a problem. In this case, the scheduler has done his job to start the task, the result of the script is not its problem. You must add in your script an error management. For logging problems in yours scripts, you can write the output in a file. For information, the event (id 201) give the return code of the executed script by the scheduler. EDIT 1 : The simpliest in my opinion is to include in yours scripts the send of mail which log the result of your script. The best is the installation of a supervision system which will survey the execution of the task and the results of the script 

I've just installed Bacula ans some clients on differents debians with differents versions of the FD. My director : 

or, for creating a new entry you can use And for the username, you can use the global variable %USERNAME%. With a GPO, you will be able to execute this script on all desired computer. . 

Hopefully, your GPO has blocked the interactive sessions and could use these two solutions. good luck 

your snmpd.conf works because snmpwalk return a result. The string rshedona is the name of the community you have chose. 

If you want to install automaticcaly your updates without rebooting after, you can apply these registry rules : I show you the results of our GPO because my interface is not in english... 

In your , you must work on the current item and not from the collection. So you must change in your command by : 

Ok!! Now it works perfectly. To answer my own question the error from the lsimrdsnmpmain was from the user which the snmpd process started. In my conf, the daemon snmpd was started with the user 'snmp' and the daemon lsimrdsnmpagent was started with the user root. I modified the user os the daemon snmpd in /etc/defaults/snmpd.conf and now the two process can speak together very well. I hope this response will help other persons who want to run the lsi megaraid sas tools on a debian. 

To delete the oldest logs, you can go the Task tab and create a job for that. It's the default paramters of Windows : After all, you mus restart yours counters to apply yours modifications. good luck! 

3. NRPE arguments By default, NRPE not allow the send of arguments from Nagios to a remote client for security considerations. So, you must enable it in the nsclient.ini for each windows station. 

This service is applied to all hosts where their names are in the declaration. You can use to exclude some hosts. It's the syntax of . 

The left part of the pipe is the response of your service, and the right is used for treating in your graph soft. EDIT 1 : 

The TCP port 12489 is the default port for using check_nt not for all the services offered by nsclient. If you want to change the default port, you can do this in the file . You would have something like this : 

ok is the status and is the performances datas. Maybe you have a problem in the result of your command, it should return : 

With this configuration, your server will not reboot after an update. Moreover, if you want to reboot your only after an update and at a time of your choice, you can create a scheduled task at the hour of your choice with a script will verifiy a needed reboot. The script: 

For dumping the memory of a process, you can try via the task manager with a right click on your process and Full memory Dump Moreover, if it always fails, you can do a dump of all your RAM. For that, you can use DumpIt, I regulary use it and it never fails. But, the size of the dump will be the size of your RAM. You will be able to work on it with volatility or other debugger 

Is Icinga2 runs on the same server of your MySQL service ? In this case you would have a problem in your command. Can you paste the detail of your command in your question. In other case, to test a Unix socket for mysql which not listen on a TCP port, you must use NRPE or SSH to connect to your mysql server and check the service. The result will be send to your icinga2 server. EDIT 1 : If you want to test a service which has not a listener on the network on a remote server, you can use several things : 

In HOST-RESOURCES-MIB, you will be able to find the entry for the CPU usage. See $URL$ for the details of this MIB and his entries. It appears there is an entry for the disks and memory (in storage) and partitions too. You can use snmpwalk or a MIB Browser to navigate in the MIB of your server. 

Yes, you can configure the prioritization when you want. But, the modifications will be applied depending of your cache duration of your shared folders. When you will modify the prioritization, yours clients will not be discconected and not will change instantly their reference. They will change at the end of the cache duration or at their next login on the dfs service. You can change the cache duration in your dfs management for each shared folder or/and for the server. To be sure where are connected yours clients, you can see the opened files in the "" in the "" on each dfs server. 

It maybe related with the profile of the user which execute the script. When you execute it from ise, you implicitly use the profile of the current user and you do the screenshot of the current screen. But when your script is executed from task scheduler, it uses the profile mentioned in the conf of the task and may not have a opened session with a desktop. It for that you have a white image, there is not any desktop with this session. You can try to change the user who will executes with a user who have an opened session and see the result.the task can be launch manually for test. 

With that, you will be able to execute remote commands on your remote server and the answer of this command will be send to your icinga2 server. This solution impose a ssh configuration between yous servers. 

youpi!!! But...when I try to pass a OID to the agent via lsi_mrdsnmpmain it returns nothing and the result code is 1 : 

You could install nrpe server on your server and send snmp requests from your server to yours printers. Nrpd will receive the response of yours printers and send it to your supervisor. 

So, the user and the members of the group can read this file (I think). I added the root to the group ossec : 

and store only the number of octets transmitted on the interface. There is not notion of time in those values. So will only retrieve this number of octets, if you don't want to use check_snmp_int to have the average of your traffic, you will must calculate yourself the average in fonction of the a intervall of time. check_snmp_int doses that, look at the help of the check, it explains how the plugin works. Help of check_snmp_int 

When your master is failed the replication is over and interrupted. So you can switch the replication and so your secondary becomes the master and the master becomes the secundary. To switch the replication you can do that directly in the hyperv interface. 

It works in Client/Server mode and you can split the differents functions of bacula between severals servers. You can manage yours backup as you wish 

This script read an OID and store the result in the variable drive. it tests the evental error of snmpget and return 3 (unknown for nagios) if problem. The snmpget options are : 

In this example, the first time takes 10 seconds with for time out, and the second try takes 40 secondes with . We can deduct of that, snmpwalk send more than one SNMP request and wait for each the delay. If your server have a snmp service and the OID doesn't exist, snmpwalk will not wait the delay and return an error. In my example, my server doesn't have a snmp service, it explains the time out. 

To change the state of a host after 5 hours, you can play with the and parameters. In your question you don't specify if you want to be notified after 5 hours or if you want your host change state only after 5 hours. notified after 5 hours : For example, you can edit those paramters to have : 

You can use for the polling of your hosts. This command will always respond OK to Nagios. Like this, your host will be always . 

For check_memory you can test it on the host with differents outputs styles, you can see nsclient.ini.sample for some examples. And test with in a admin console 

You should verify the default template of yours hosts and services. It's possible to have specified in those templates which are applied (by default) on yours services and hosts. It explains why in doesn't work. The priority is done in this order : 

If you have a 'yes' to these two questions, maybe your problem is from the DNS redirection on your DC. If you have a 'no' your problem is from the opened ports on your DC. 

It will give the number of waiting files, and more generally, which file... You can invert the source and destination to get the replication state of the other side. Edit comment You can use to test which replication is used. If the command return 'dfsr not initalized', you use FSR. 

I don't know check_mk but i'm surprising about the status of the result of your command. To have performance datas you should have a pipe which separate the status from the performances datas like that : 

The box dialog seems to be the acceptation of the hostkey of the remote server. Putty asks to confirm the hostkey to store this key in the registry of the user who wants to connect to him. If you want to bypass this dialog, you can force the use of a specified hostkey with the option. Moreover, you can explain to putty to use a serie of commands stored in a text file with the option. All these options are explained here : putty 

Like this, when your host is down, icinga will retry each 1 hour () 5 times (). After, 5 hours you will be notified. But in inciga2 console, your host will be screened as down since the first hour (). Host down after 5 hours: In this case, you must specify and what you want in the others to be notified after 5 hours. 

The append of your volume can be one day or one job, and the used 20 days. This example is only available if you want to have one job/volume/day. 

And all works fine. During the install, I'd got the same fatal error and it was a problem in my DNS resolution. Maybe you have the same problem of accessibility (DNS, firewall,routing,vlan,...). 

If you want to physically delete the jobs and so the files older than 21 days, you can play with the volume retention. If you only use the job retention, bacula will not delete the old files in the old jobs. It will just delete their entries in the database. In your example, to delete (purge) the old saves, you can configure to have a volume per day and a retention of yours volumes equal to 20 days. You can use this doc of the bacula website to understand the differentes options : 

You can use the nagios plugins which contain the script check_netint. This script will calculate the bandwith of an interface from the datas stored in the MIB of your router with SNMP. 

And you will have to install a soft which will treat your perf datas. It's not check_snmp_int.pl which will save your perfdatas. It only send his results like this : result of the check|graph1=... graph2=... example : 

is the version of snmp the community the output options By default, snmpwalk return the result of the system MIB. 

This script will receive the args of the snmptrapd daemon, and will echo them . So you can add a command to export to a file to see if your configuration works fine. 

Are you sure your initial replication is finished ? To be sure, you can check in your event journal the event id 2214 which must indicate your initiale replication is correctly finished. Moreover, to verify the status of your replication, you can lanch this command : 

So if you use ctime you will search the files where theirs datas or their owners/permissions has not been modified since 5 days. To be sure of the dates of yours files, you can see the differents timestamps with the following command : 

You can prefix the name of your file and select his format like this example. And in the properties of your collector, you must select Restart the data set (sorry my interface is in french, you can see the image below) and select the duration of the task : 

For example, I change the owner of today, so the ctime is today and the mtime is stayed in 2016. And after cat fi.le, the access time is also updated :
