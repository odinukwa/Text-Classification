Enchanted Keyfinder is an open source fork of Magical Jelly Bean, since Magical Jelly Bean went the route of a paid tool. 

Just a very brief rundown: For video, the major formats concerning DVDs/AVIs: MPEG-1, MPEG-2 / VOB, MPEG4 / MP4 / H.263, FLV, WMV, MVK For audio: AAC, MP2, MP3 MPEG-1 typically isn't used much, unless it's for importing video from a camera, or as a common format for using among a wide range of video editors or players. MPEG-2 / VOB is what's on a playable DVD, which is paired with MP2 audio MPEG-4 / MP4 / H.263 is what's typically in use for video files these days. It's often paired with AAC or MP3 audio. FLV is flash video, which is paired with MP3 audio. Flash video has largely been seen on sites which use flash video players. However, many sites have been migrating over to MPEG-4 / H.263. WMV used to be in wide use, but not so much anymore. It's typically limited to live streaming nowadays. The compression rate is impressive. 

A quick search pulled up that WPA is supported on that laptop (if that were not the case, it would be a hardware limitation which couldn't be turned on by a flip of the switch). Try looking on Toshiba's site or Agere's site for updated drivers for the wireless card. 

Go to the Catalyst Control Center, go to the Information Center > Graphics Center. Look at "Catalyst Version". That will display the version you have installed. The version number which appears in the device manager is the "driver packaging version", I'm not clear on what exactly it is, but it is not the catalyst driver version. I'm assuming it has something to do with the installer utility--either the version of the installer utility, or the version of the software used to create the installer. 

"View" menu > "Minimal View". That hides all the buttons and menus, but leaves the window border and windows minimize/maximize/close buttons. May I ask what you're trying to accomplish with this? 

You can set up a batch file to do this. Open up notepad, and after you are done, save it and name it something like "start_game.bat" and change the file type to "all files". This step makes sure the file extension gets changed to .bat 

Not quite. There's a tool called Bad Copy which is known for the ability to recover deleted files from flash cards and USB flash drives. 

After rebooting, clearing out all my temp files, running windows updates, and running adobe updates, it looks like the problem fixed itself. Opening the file info dialog now takes about 1 second to open. 

I have a USB flash drive with a hidden encrypted partition on it. I'd like to reuse it, but so far I have been unsuccessful in wiping it. It is an SanDisk Cruzer 8GB with what I assume was with the U3 software that originally came along with it. Viewing it in Windows 7's Disk Management tool only reveals a 64MB RAW partition that I can't delete or format. I attempted to use the command line tool, but was unable to format or delete the partition. Since I'm unfamiliar with the tool, I just might not be using the correct sequence of commands: 

What operating system are you running? Here's a list of a few more: $URL$ Never used one extensively myself. I'd certainly do extensive testing before I'd rely on a 3rd-party shell for a work environment. If all you really need is virtual desktop support, there's a whole slew of 3rd-party tools. Microsoft PowerToy for XP: $URL$ And a few others kicking around: 

There's a feature that puts a line marker next to the line numbers. Search > find. Check the option "mark line". 

In order to run Windows 7's Virtual PC, you'll need Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate. Home Premium won't work. Virtual PC 2007 SP1 should work on Windows 7, but it's not "officially" supported. VirtualBox is another option if this doesn't work for you, though I'm not familiar with the conversion process. 

I'm running Skype 4.2.0.169. I've seen mention of the contact grouping feature for older versions of skype, but I can't seem to find it in the current version. Was it removed, renamed something else, or well hidden? Every other piece of chat software allows you to group contacts / screen names, so I would think Skype has it kicking around somewhere. Any Ideas? Thanks :) 

VLC can usually play partially complete or corrupted files, though it depends how complete the file actually is. 

Use the manufacturer's diagnostic tools. You can either get them from the manufacturer's website (though you may need to jump through a few hoops to locate them), or download the Ultimate Boot CD, which has them included. $URL$ 

I have a website that is used for check-ins. Unfortunately, the computer is in an area that isn't used often throughout the day, so the website used for check-ins logs itself out after a certain amount of time of inactivity. The website being used does not have an option to adjust the timeout period. Is there a way in IE9 to automatically redirect to a new page (or the home page) after a certain amount of time? The current page should not be refreshed, as it has a check-in number within the URL (something like $URL$ So if that page is refreshed, then the check-in happens multiple times (which is undesirable). 

Send a Personal Distribution List to Someone Else Note that by sending a distribution list to someone else, you are only sending them a copy. Any changes that you make to your own distribution list will not be reflected in any copies that you send to other people. 1) In Outlook’s left-hand pane, click to the “Contacts” section. 2) Open the contact group. 3) Click the “Forward Group” button, then the “As Outlook Contact” menu item. 4) This will automatically create a new email message with the distribution list attached to it. Enter the intended recipient(s) and click send. Import a Distribution List From Someone Else Note: If someone is sending you an update for a distribution list that was already sent to you, you will need to delete the existing distribution list or you will end up with two different copies. 1) To import, first open the email message with the attached distribution list file. 2) Drag and drop the attachment from the email message to the “Contacts” button. 

I needed to edit some of the metadata that gets saved with images.The images in question were pulled from a camera and are 2576x1932 @ 230dpi, and saved as PSDs. In Photoshop CS4, if I open the PSDs and go to File > File Info, it takes approximately 2-3 minutes before it displays the dialog window. In the meantime, photoshop freezes and jumps to 25% CPU utilization. That seems like an excessively long time, considering my hardware specs are decent (Win XP 32-bit, Q9550, 4GB RAM seen as 3.25GB). Any other actions, such as opening, saving and editing take under a second. Is there a faster way to do this? 

Since you have two WANs in place, under the section, check and . I'm guessing that the subnets might be specified there for routing specific traffic to and from the LANs and WANs. 

I'm looking at Visio 2007, so this might be different in other versions. You can specify the measurement manually: View > Size & Position Window. select the object. Type in the angle you want. To turn on/off snapping, show the snap toolbar: View > Toolbars > Snap & Glue 

Any distro of linux/unix has command line access. It's called the terminal. Not all distros come with a GUI by default, so you will encounter the terminal upon installation of the distro. Do you already have a distro of linux installed and available? What are you trying to accomplish, exactly? Are you looking for a SSH client for remote access, like Putty? 

The splash screen is the Dell logo with a loading bar. If it's been disabled, you'll see a listing of your system specs (RAM, CPU, drives, etc). During that time, press Ctrl+F11 If it doesn't appear, you might not have the PC Restore feature and will have to use the CDs that came with your laptop. [edit]: Your laptop's manual can be found here. Jump to page 84. 

Once SMART failure is triggered, the drive is pretty much gone. Sometimes you can recover data, sometimes not. I would certainly not sell it to somebody. Either try a warranty replacement if it's still under warranty, or smash it up with a hammer and chuck it in the trash. 

If you're using a flash application, if you right click on it and click "Settings", there's a microphone tab and a camera tab where you can select the devices you wish to use. 

If you don't need a gaming card, two 3450's might be less expensive. They each have HDMI, DVI and VGA as outputs. DisplayPorts can be adapted to VGA, a single link HDMI or a single link DVI-I with a passive adapter. Powered adapters usually draw power from USB, and offer dual-link outputs. The difference between single link and dual link is the maximum resolution you get out of it. Note: the 5770 has a full-sized DisplayPort, not a Mini. 

I have piles of RAM scattered around my work area. Currently, they're not organized very well, nor protected against ESD. I was hoping to find out what others did to organize their piles of spare RAM. I was envisioning some sort of special storage case with slots for each stick, but I wasn't able to turn up anything like that. How do you store your spare RAM? 

I have run malwarebytes and Microsoft Security Essentials scans, which have come up clean. I attempted to use microsoft's "fix it" tool for windows update, but that didn't appear to do anything (the "loading" progress bar was displayed, then it disappeared). I also tried the manual reset instructions, but that was unsuccessful as well. Any other suggestions? 

During the point at which XP setup prompts you to select a partition to install windows to, opt to delete the partition, recreate it, and format it. 

RAID5 is typically used for redundancy. So, if one drive fails, your data is still there. There are some speed benefits as well. RAID5 is also more common for servers than desktops. RAID 1 is not a reliable backup option. If one drive fails or the data gets corrupted, it sometimes gets carried over to the second drive. I've seen this first-hand more than a few times. RAID3 and RAID10 don't offer enough redundancy to always survive a failed HDD. RAID 0 offers performance, but doubles your changes of data loss since if either drive in the array dies, you loose everything. The best option would probably to use one drive as your O/S and programs, another for data, and a third for external backup. 

Right click on the task bar and uncheck "lock the taskbar". You should then be free to drag the toolbars around. When you're done, go ahead and lock the task bar again so you don't accidentally move the toolbars. 

Is the BIOS a removable chip on your motherboard? If so, this guy has saved my bacon in the past: $URL$ If it's not removable, you still might want to send an email to see if anything can be done about it: $URL$ [edit]: My apologies, I linked to the wrong site earlier. Both sites were based in New Jersey and I was posting from memory. 

Since it only affected the older Zune 30 model, MS did not bother to release a fix. The Zune 30's resumed operation on the following day (Jan 1), so the fix was just to wait a day. If this issue occurred with a newer zune model (especially one that was still under warranty), they probably would've taken the time to fix it. The next leap year is 2012, so it's questionable how many Zune 30's will still be in service at that time. I know my Zune 30 is nearing the end of its life, as its battery can only hold about a 15-30 minute charge these days after being used regularly for about 3 years. 

I encounted a unique situation on a network I recently took over. A windows Vista SP1 workstation lost its connection to the domain, displaying the error message "The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed". Normally, in the rare instances when I've seen that occur, I simply logged in as the local administrator, disconnected the computer from the domain, and re-connected it to the domain. However, the local administrator account is disabled and was likely never enabled. The local user that was used to initially configure the workstation is either disabled, or uses a password I don't have a record for. The domain user who normally logs into the workstation cannot log in (the cached credencials have likely expired). Is there anything I can do? 

I've seen a few recommendations for this tool, though it's not free: $URL$ And a few recommendations for this one, which is free: $URL$ If you're removing things manually, as long as the CS4 and CS5 files were dropped into different folders in the Applications folder, you can delete the CS4 folder without it affecting CS5. If you start deleting items from the System and Library folders...you might run into problems there. 

I use this for my HTPC, and have recommended it to several others who are quite satisfied with it. It takes AA batteries, and they last quite a long time. When not in use, the keyboard and mouse enter a power save mode--there's no on/off switch like with other wireless devices, as you mention as being a problem. $URL$ 

I have an imaged lab environment running Windows 7 and attached to a domain. The local Administrator account is enabled for certain maintenance and prep tasks. Every time I logoff from the local Administrator account, it brings me back to the standard Ctrl+Alt+Del login screen. When I press that combination, all the user controls vanish except for the accessibility button down in the left hand corner. The only way I can seem to escape from this is to tap the power button to initiate a shutdown. Windows is up-to-date, and logging off as any other user operates normally. The "hide last user" local security policy option is enabled. Has anyone seen this phenomenon before and how can I stop this from happening? 

Unfortunately, the newest version of movie maker removed a lot of good features, leaving it a shell of its former self. You will probably have to look to a 3rd-party tool for video compression (after exporting your video from movie maker), such as handbrake or winFF 

Download the manufacturer's drive diagnostic (or use the Ultimate Boot CD), and run the diagnostic. If this is an internal drive, it might be starting to go on you. If it's an external drive, the USB controller on the enclosure might be going. 

You can try Digsby. Direct download here: $URL$ Or Trillian, though there is the option of a paid version of this one. 

you can't "uninstall" an operating system and go back to an older one. It's a one-way operation. If you want to go back to Vista, you will have to reinstall it using your Windows CD, Restore CD, or recovery partition. 

I was working on a spreadsheet in Excel 2010, and all of a sudden when I attempted to insert a new row of cells, I saw that the insert and delete options were grayed out. I attempted to copy a different row and insert it as a new row, but I got the error message: "This operation is not allowed. The operation is attempting to shift cells in a table on your worksheet." I have not merged or hidden any cells/rows/columns. There are no formulas. There is no data verification. I tried closing and re-opening the spreadsheet. Searching for answers brings up nothing useful. 

The recovery procedure will wipe the laptop and restore it to how it was when it was shipped from the factory. All your data will be lost. You probably shouldn't have messed around in the registry, as it might have done more harm than good. The only time I muck around in the registry is for something very specific or when I clean a computer's registry using ccleaner. Go ahead and try that tool. Are you connecting wirelessly, or connecting directly with an ethernet cable? What are you getting for an IP address and DNS server? Do any alternate browsers work normally? This will determine if there's a problem with just IE or a problem with connectivity.
