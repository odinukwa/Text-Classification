There is written (you have more than one) that the script fail when copy () a file to , `/lib/ ... usually on the main partition. How to fix Get an idea from then 

Some words more I understand your confusion indeed for what I read from the rfc6761 about "Special-Use Domain Names" 6.3 [3], about the name localhost, 

Now let's we complicate a bit the things: Why can you find thing as y_(x') inside a function as the 1st, or instead of the simple variable in function 2d as f(g(x),h(y))? Because when you analyse real data you can find that a constant parameter is not so constant, so can be cosy to give a functional dependence to that parameter. If you write the dependence of the parameter at the extern of the function you can always change it quickly without have to modify the expression of the function itself. Moreover when you do a FIT you have just ready the function to plot of parameter behaviour respect ... respect his dependencies. If the FIT shows that the parameter is a constant, you can repeat the FIT fixing the parameter to a simple constant, killing the functionality. (i.e. , for each it will answer always ). If the FIT doesn't converge you can try to find another functionality for the parameter. 

For what it concerns the alias currently used on your system you can check your hosts file, [1] or in a different place if on a different system [2] . You may find ,,, or itself... 

(or ) are internal command of . You can have access to their definition with . With the command you can understand if a command is a built-in shell or not. E.g. the command will answer 

You're probably using the same device name for the second device, you should post the commands that you used. 

Xpra is a compositing window manager, I quote: The window manager composites the window buffers into an image representing the screen and writes the result into the display memory.. In the xpra case, the display memory is on the client and until you attach your client it does not exist, and so there is nothing displayed on the vfb. That's just how xpra works. If you want to use xpra and still pipe the vfb to ffmpeg using x11grab, you can start your vfb separately and then use to access the existing vfb via xpra. (xpra shadow mode is much less efficient... because it doesn't use compositing, it uses screenscraping like x11grab does) As of version 0.16, there is a new option called sync-xvfb (in milliseconds) which can be used to also paint the virtual screen, which you can then capture. 

x264 now supports OpenCL encoding acceleration. How much acceleration you get will depend on your graphics card's performance, on my GTS 450 I get none and with slower cards it actually slows down encoding. Better cards may help. All you need to do is add --opencl to the x264 command line. I believe handbrake makes use of the same x264 libraries and does offer the same OpenCL acceleration in newer builds. 

You're not saying which X11 version or which distro you are using which is making difficult to help. You should try using a different X11 driver (vesa, ati, vga, ..), and maybe booting with a VESA mode (ie: vga=792 kernel option). 

I like your script but, if needed, you can do it by command line directly from the current directory: 

It's possible that you need to download and install again the extension pack. If you want to do it from command line: You have to replace with the path to your downloaded extension pack and to use the option in case you have already installed a previous version of the extension pack. 

will give you the filename with the inside. Often in linux the command answer with that will be a problem if used as a part of filename for the character . I do not have a mac to check what is the answer but I think it's easier/safer and more general to use the hostname. Note: if you do not have the command and you should have set the variable with the hostname inside. 

The Hdd and Usb pen drive do not keep by themself information about the computer connected. Usually. (Some special usb devices that seems usb pen drive but that have some computing components inside can do whatever they are programmed for). But the computers can leave temporary files with information about themselves (but even hidden trash can directories...) 

Usually from the BIOS you can select from which device/drive to start from. It is motherboard depending... but usually you can switch the order entering in the BIOS and saving the changes. You can even try to disable an HDD and hide it to the other operative system; I said you can try because some operative system can in some cases overcame this feature and see the HDD however. Some BIOSes allow you, pressing a special combinations of keys, to enter in a reduced menu with only the list of devices from which you can boot, then you can select the one you prefer. All depends from the couple of BIOS/Motherboard you have. 

You can share your windows using xpra, either moving them to the other X11 session or showing them on both at the same time. 

Don't use the version of xpra from the Ubuntu repositories. Those are fundamentally broken, see problems with distribution packages. Use the official packages from xpra.org instead. 

If you want to run something like eclipse on the remote machine, you will want to be able to re-connect to the session in case the network drops. If you used "ssh -X", the session would crash instead. For that, you need something like Xpra or NX. Which will also give you much better performance than plain X11 or SSH-X11. 

You may find some shared network clipboard tools out there, but as far as I am aware, none of them are easy to install or setup (most require compiling from source). I have added clipboard sharing to xpra for various platforms, I believe you could use it to achieve what you want. Xpra is normally used for forwarding windows and sound (as well as clipboard), but there are switches to disable all the stuff you don't need. (ie: "--no-windows", "--no-speaker", ..) Note: if you want to connect to an existing X11 display (rather than a new dedicated xpra session), you will have to use "xpra shadow :0" instead of "xpra start ..." Then from the client, just "xpra attach ssh:SERVER:0" Alternatively, if you are happy to use the command line and scripting, there is always xclip. 

This may not be what you are looking for, but you could just draw the programs on the Ubuntu server and display them on the mac using xpra. There are other advantages to this approach: lower bandwidth consumption, no crash if the network drops (just re-connect). 

If the script is on the remote machine write the command that you have checked before via command line. For more information check here about .desktop syntax or even here. The part is where you can write what you want to execute. I cannot help you to connect specifically with tty1, but via you will be connected with the first available. Final Notes: 

Some words more In your version is a variable never assigned and so empty. The result of the command inside the cycle becomes, for example, 

To have a deeper picture you can give it a look to the wikipedia about VMware Workstation [1] and about the Virtual Machine Monitor [6]. 

You can start with this one as your new custom file. If it works you can modify what you need until you will find the option in conflict. 

Looking in the metadata saved with the document. There are too many versions and subversions of the Microsoft Office products to give you a unique an exhaustive answer. In earlier version it was included then it was removed, nowadays if present it should be traceable in the metadata section (see below), but it should be still encoded in a somehow hidden way somewhere else. There is an additional issue: privacy laws in different countries. If not clearly stated in the contract (and successive modification) exactly which kind of "private" information are shared, even Microsoft can incur in sanctions. So you may check, carefully, in the licence agreement of your OS/program version[e.g. w10,msa]. It's a long task, I know, but if you go on aka.ms/privacy and click "Learn More" below "Personal Data We Collect" I noted some time ago[answer] that you already agreed to share it
