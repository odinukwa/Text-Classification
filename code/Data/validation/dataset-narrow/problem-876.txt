An apple's airport express can do do the job as well as any other wireless router. You'll need to configure the router in a browser type: 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 and follow what you need to. 

Ubuntu is well known to change configuration file without any reason (they did alot with apache). So try to search the internet for apache conf file in unbuntu or try the locate command (with proper file name) and you'll maybe find what you're searching for. 

It's not not secure from people sniffing the network. Just think about it when user need to connect there javascript hashes their password and send them to the server. The server compares it to the database. A sniffer would only have to sniff the password and send it to the server so this is as secure as clear text password. As others said I recommend SSL/TLS tunnels to be establish to connect to your server. 

I want to place a VPN beetween home and school because I do not trust the network down there. If I configure the VPN server with NAT-T (nat-traversal) and configure my router to foward UDP 20 -> UDP 500 && UDP 21 -> 4500 (I also configure the client to use UDP 20 for IKE and 21 for NAT-t) will the configuration works? And is IKE mandatory in order to ipsec to function? 

calls .Net and creates objects using a constructor in the class. You can find out what "type" the data is by piping the cmdlet to like this: 

Remember, as a powershell professional your code should be as easily read as possible. As with all professional writing, style matters. Also, you should look into using for using username/passwords so you're not writing them in plain text. 

The Powershell cmdlet queries a myriad of data and performs validation tests which it wraps into a pretty report. If you run you get a list of item's you can individually query with the cmdlet. There's a common naming scheme when you read the 's. They all start with either "List" or "Validate". Obviously "Validate" is going to actually test the failover by failing. But naming something "List" makes me think it's just a query for data as is at the time it was run. I've tested this with the following script: 

The WMI class uses the MSI provider to collect installed program data. This means you're only going to get data on software/packages installed using MSI. Further, calling this class causes a repair action to be executed on every program it returns. Most of the time this isn't an issue, but it will fill up the event log and can cause issues for some software. You can get more detail on this link: Win32_Product Class Most scripters, coders, etc use one of two things; 1) Registry Query, 2) WMI query of the SCCM class . Obviously the SCCM class requires SCCM to be installed on the host. You can read more about that HERE. So that really only leaves the registry query for most folx. Don't fret though, because all the work was already done for you by TSG. Your pot of gold is "Use PowerShell to Quickly Find Installed Software" While I'd do things slightly differently than in that post, it has all the heavy lifting already written. With a little aptitude and some google searching you can customize as you wish. 

As shown in the email and assuming all relay actually appended a Received: field. The mail was properly received by your bluehost server on 03:19:55 -0600 within seconds of being sent. As shown by line: 

If you run bash yo can edit /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc. They are analog to the user ~/.profile and ~/.bashrc. So put all your common vars in /etc and user more specifc in ~/. 

If I understood well you want to delegate the DNS from your registar to your own DNS server. So yes it is possible you just have to tell your registar to point to it. You will need to add an NS record and a A record to point to your server and server's IP address And so you'll will be the authoritative DNS server for your zone. It should look like this: registar: example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com. example.com. IN NS ns2.example.com. ns1.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; ip of ns server is needed because it's the only way for everbody ns2.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; to know where you are You: example.com. IN SOA ( ;;; soa blargh!! As it means Start Of Authority you are the one ) example.com. IN NS ns1.example.com. example.com. IN NS ns2.example.com. a.ramdom.host.example.com. IN A 0.0.0.0 ;; ip of a random host 

The error is trying (in microsoft fashion) to tell you that it needs a script block after a . Replace the line with the following to continue past that error: 

In your post you didn't specify where your user list is coming from. It looks like you're getting the users of one group and seeing what else they're a member of. It's largely irrelevant to the solution so I'll assume you have a list of and go from there. What you want to do is combine properties from two commands into a single output stream. This can be accomplished by leveraging Calculated Properties like so... 

The creators of Powershell at Microsoft wanted to create a single new product that would replace the cmd shell and vbscript. One of the primary goals of Powershell was to standardize cmdlet naming, call site proceedure, switch naming, and output (as an object). Anecdotally, another primary focus was eliminating the security flaws of vbscript. By default Powershell cmdlets are Overloaded so that the same example function can be called like so: 

Length of System Up Time If you want to find out how long the system has been online you can do this (this is also an alternate code style): 

Normally it will be an unsigned 32 bit (on 32-bit system) so 2^32 = 4294967296. So the range is 0-4294967295. 

As they are block these connections are not harmful for a DDOS. Logs are only there to let you know who tried to attack you. What is harmful is when the number of half connection opened gets near the limit you specified in your config. What I suggest you is to follow the advice of Zypher and have your firewall to moderate these connections. 

The ~ means the home directory of the current user (or the user you try to connect to), but watch out adding the authorized_keys file to a user permits the one with the private key to connect to your server (without any password). 

Yes it's possible to do so put a htaccess in the file you want to moderate the access. Put the same text as in the configuration file. Make sure that your conf files will read .htaccess. 

I am trying to follow this procedure to add a registry key to all my domains computer. The thing is that I don't see anything under: 

If you have access to the firewall inside the router, I would deny HTTP packets coming from the WAN interface. If the HTTP is accepted from the inside then with the vpn it is just a question of connecting to the vpn and then to the remote access. 

None of the properties there appear to map to any tickets (run a gm on it too). Granted, this could be ignorance on my part and the method to produce the tickets just isn't aptly named or described. I've tried looking at the SMlets source code to glean some insight, but I'm not a C# developer so some of it goes over my head. I've also tried to get some understanding and help from the msdn page for EnterpriseManagementObject Class, but to no avail. Hopefully there's a really simple solution to this and I'm just over thinking it. But, how do you get the Affected User for a SCSM ticket using powershell? Preferably a service request ticket. 

When using network resource file systems, and UNC paths, you should use the PSProvider in Powershell. Here's a couple examples: 

If the array count is short eyeball the provider names. Microsoft didn't use a standard naming convention so you can forget filtering with something useful like "MSProvider". 3rd parties were advised and asked, yet not required, to create their providers for their own namespaces. Anything not in "CIMV2" should stand out and be looked at more closely. For reference you can review how 3rd parties register a WMI provider and what information is required when doing so here. The objects returned by the code above have a CLSID property which corresponds to their entry in the Windows registry. You could loop through them and query the registry and see if a 3rd party added any values to the key you could use to identify them with. Happy hunting. 

Context switch are normal. A process is assigned to an quanta of time, if it finish (or it paused caused by the need of ressources) what it have to do it can let the processor go. That said to count how many context switch are done (it becomes a stackoverflow.com answers) it would take the internal kernel schedule() command to write into the processes tables. A there is no such thing if you program your own kernel you'll be able to see but it's quite difficult. 

I am using Windows Server 2012 R2, and after it reboots I absolutely need to connect to it in local or else it will not allow any connections (RDP, shared folders). What is the option (local or group policy) to allow connection without needing one to connect to it in person. 

When you add an IP address to a specific interface (let it be by DHCP or manually with ifconfig), linux kernel will add this IP's subnet's route as being on that specific interface. This is because logically you are part of the subnet. Possible issues would be: 

I not sure to what you want to install both apache version on your server. It is like you want the brand new model of car and the old one too. There is no reason you can not install it but there will be a problem if they try to serve on the same port (80) as on will block the other. But if you configure them on different port it will work. Again I don't know why you want to do this. 

I'm using to download a file from the internet and place it in a network location. The location is similar to which the cmdlet says it can't find and that it doesn't exist. To get to pass successfully you have to add the filesystem provider to the location like this: . The rub is that doesn't like destinations with the filesystem provider declared and errors with "The path is not of a legal form". The problem is further compounded by the inability to use and run the code in a remote shell on the destination server. blocks this usage. What's the solution to using with a network location? 

Double check and ensure you're running powershell as an administrator. This problem can occur if your instance isn't elevated as some password policies (GPO) are likely hidden. 

So you've already done the hard part of generating your list in . You're probably over thinking how to do the email and that's what's tripping you up. Remember, Powershell is there to make your life easier. If it seems too complicated, there's likely an easier way to do it. Anyway you need to figure out the following variables and add them to your code: 

Debian Gnu/Linux is well known for its stability. But what you search is something running mostly samba and any *nix is capable of so go with what you feel. 

It's not because you pay for something it is good, this is what I trust. But alot of people think the converse. 1 000 000 million people can be wrong. 

The problem with well constructed rootkit is that they modify your system's command; like ps and top to not show the processes of the rootkit and ls to not show files of the rootkit. So what you'll need to do is to get these command possibly from source or in binairies form. (Be sure to be well signed). But the trick of a root kit (I've seen it) is that they maybe corrupted your compiler too. So when the compiler knows he is compiling ls or ps or any command he infectet them as well. When I saw this problem I said fine lets recompile gcc, but no what I need to have to compile gcc...the infecte gcc....so when he knows he is compiling itself he infect it so it can infect the command. You will say that this come big and difficult to detect, yes but rare are the root kit that are so bulletproof I just gave youthe worse case. Seriously, if you are sure that there is a root kit in your server, reinstall it! 

The command is actually enumerating the methods and properties of the object created by Get-Service as well as it's TypeName. You can see the TypeName immediately after entering the command. That TypeName corresponds to a .Net class which you then google (no really). You have to drill through the msdn page a bit which requires a basic understanding of object oriented programming (I know, another google). Eventually you should land on the ServiceControllerStatus Enumeration page which lists all the possible value descriptions. The values returned are actually integers, but .Net is kind enough to turn those values into something we can understand. Hopefully if you practice this process a little, you'll be able to apply this same method to find info on other objects in powershell. 

Detail My first thought is that I'm using the cmdlet wrong or winrm isn't working (it is). I also thought that maybe there's a difference in the way it's called that's causing the failure. Following that logic I reviewed the following technet page on the cmdlet: Research: $URL$ Based on the writing there, I couldn't discern an obvious user error. So I've tried a few things to figure it out. First I thought maybe I'm just constantly screwing up the typing so I did this:
