I eventually noticed that the cursor got stuck when I started my gesture from somewhere in roughly the upper 25% of the trackpad like so: 

There's a tool called ReliefJet Essentials which does this. The feature is called "Disable or Enable Warnings" and is at $URL$ 

Realizing that the unattended/silent install worked (since that's what the System Update utility does), I ran the driver install in unattended mode rather than the default interactive mode: setup.exe -install I rebooted when it completed and it worked! 

Instapaper looks interesting because it does page clean-up, but it's not clear to me that it actually stores the page content or is full text searchable. In addition, they state in their FAQ that their storage isn't mean to be long term. Thoughts on addressing the gaps and improving this process further? 

See this reply from a user on the Microsoft TechNet forums: $URL$ "I've had this sort of problem too (OneNote is imagining fonts that aren't actually there). I'm pretty sure it will be fixed before the final 2010 release. Given The down key doesn't work in OneNote most of the time when using fixed width fonts, it seems like there are significant font-related problems... and since I was told that the fixed width font issue was already fixed in an unreleased version, hopefully the other issues are fixed too. A quick fix would be to just use the font OneNote seems to want you to use. That's what I'm doing (though I really miss my fixed width fonts!!). Also, I've not had the magic font issue with the 2007 notebook formats." 

I am using Outlook 2007 on Windows XP for work, and always hit to send messages. That's the shortcut in Mail.app and in MobileMe's Mail web app, and I prefer it to , which is Outlook's send mail shortcut. Spoiled by Mac OS X's ability to easily change shortcuts for any application, I've been looking for a way to change the shortcut. How can you do this? Update I ended up using TeX HeX's suggestion, AutoHotkey. The script I wrote is below: 

It's #2 that seems to be giving me problems. No matter what I do, no files ever pass through its filter. When I expand the results for Get Folder Contents and any other Finder actions, I always see files in the results. But even when I specify the most permissive filters, this action never produces anything. If you want to debug this, just insert a new action up top: Get Specified Finder Items, dropping on any directory that has any files within it - although technically the "Filter Finder Items" should also be able to return folders. Update I'm now on Lion, and seeing the exact same behavior. I also tried replacing step 2's criteria with "Name ends with 'part'" but that didn't make a difference either. I ultimately ended up writing an AppleScript that accomplished the same task (see below). 

The problem is that after the script runs, the "Open with" association is gone; the file opens with Console.app again. Is there any way around this in the script, like setting back the appropriate metadata after the line? 

I'm running Outlook 2010 in Cached Exchange mode against an Exchange 2007 server. Outlook's status bar shows "updating cached messages (2/1950)" and the number never increments. What does "updating cached messages" mean? Information is sparse. Intuitively it seems like some kind of indexing process on the emails cached in the local .OST file. 

I want to create new Chrome windows (no tabs) from outside of Chrome, e.g. by running Chrome.exe multiple times. How can I do this so as to get a single Chrome window? The default result is to create new tabs in the existing window which requires me to drag and drop the tag to create a new window. 

By default, Outlook 2010 creates an "RSS Feeds" folder which cannot be deleted in the usual way you would delete a folder. 

Is there a way to prime Outlook's local address cache with names/email addresses from the local address book? It's a real hassle when, for example, you move a user from another email client to Outlook and they have to either type in or look up the recipient's name the first time they email that person. It's so time consuming. Update: Is the process different for Exchange mailboxes vs. IMAP? 

I want to remove the folder, so I read How to Remove RSS Support from Outlook and discovered the MFCMapi gem of a utility. I followed the instructions in the section "Delete the RSS folder using MFCMAPI" section, and was able to remove the folder from Outlook. However, the "RSS Feeds" folder now shows in the "Deleted Items" folder in Outlook Web Access (OWA) and also on my mobile devices, but not in Outlook. In OWA I attempted a right-click and delete, but I am told that folder cannot be deleted. I poked around my OST file (I am running in cached exchange mode) using again using MFCMapi to see if I could find the folder but I do not see it. Finally I created a new Outlook profile in which I do not cache messages, so I could get a "live" look at the server and attempt to see the folder and delete it that way, but it still did not show. Any ideas? 

You can also use the application X-Mouse Button Control to accomplish this. You only need to set the "Wheel Up" button to the "Scroll Window Down" command, and vice-versa. I am using this on Windows XP, but the app should work on 7 or Vista, also. It was very quick to set up, and since it's a GUI application, it was easier to use. 

I've been trying to make an Automator droplet that removes files of a particular extension from a directory. My Workflow has 3 actions (when I'm not debugging): 

I just turned on Google syncing in my Snow Leopard (Mac OS X) Address Book, but I'm not seeing my Address Book groups in Gmail or Google Voice. Is this supposed to be the case? Is there a way to get it to work? 

I recently started using a KVM at work, and now every time I switch one of my machines sounds off Windows XP's connected or disconnected device wav file. Is there a way to disable this without muting the whole system (which is what I'm currently doing)? I went to the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties (from the Control Panel) and then the Sounds tab, and couldn't clear out the sound setting. 

I'm connecting to my Snow Leopard (Mac OS X 10.6) from my Windows XP work computer using both TightVNC and RealVNC, and both of those don't give me access to the Option key. So to work around that, I tried using Keyboard Viewer, but that doesn't respond to clicks through these VNC clients. Does anyone have any suggestions? 

The process is almost perfect. I've got the central access and ubiquitous access of Gmail as the storage mechanism, full text searchability (due to Gmail, but of course only for the URLs I send from that Firefox extension), a cleaned up page due to Readability, ability to read offline (assuming I use an IMAP client against Gmail) and permanent archiving of content, including what's been read vs. unread. The missing pieces are: 

I'm creating port forwarding rules on my DD-WRT router (shown below) and want to allow all (any) source networks access. My thought was to specify 0.0.0.0/32 but that is not working. How do I specify this? 

I re-listened to the video at $URL$ and realized that the Google Apps Outlook Sync tool isn't meant for this. I wanted to keep working against Exchange and simply have my emails be synced to my google apps account. What the tool is doing is creating a new Outlook profile which points to your google apps account, then imports your emails et al from your original Exchange profile into this new profile, ie your data is now sitting in Google Apps. Once the import is done your content is re-downloaded from google apps back to your outlook client in the new profile. The video goes on to say that you can turn off Exchange and keep working with outlook against google apps. So Exchange is out of the picture. 

I want an Autohotkey script which launches a new instance of Chrome and brings that new window to the forefront (active window). My script is: 

After some poking around and searching more, I found the answer, and it lies in ordinarily invisible data and metadata. The upshot is that iTunes LP primarily references files based on their XID. In order to assign the correct XIDs to the new files in iTunes, do the following (on a Mac): 

Get Folder Contents (Repeating for each subfolder) Filter Finder Items (File extension is "part") Move Finder Items to Trash 

It seems conclusive at this point that this whole thing was caused by remnants of my Parallels Desktop installation (specifically some networking daemon) that didn't get uninstalled properly when I switched to VMware Fusion. Since completely removing Parallels, as described here, I haven't seen "pe-xpjalle" in my sidebar. Thanks for all of the help. 

I have an iTunes LP that I want to be able to use with alternate versions of the song files (higher/lower bitrate), but the iTunes LP isn't able to play the new versions of the files. What's missing? 

I installed Lion on Partition A, so it's now 11.5 GB, after the Recovery HD partition took its share. I've tried booting holding down Option, and neither Partition A or Recovery HD show up, though both do with USB. Also, when it's plugged in with FW800, Partition A does show up in the Startup preference pane. When I select it and restart, though, it spends a long time before the Apple logo shows up, and I end up booted to my default, internal disk. I tried plugging directly into the front FW800 port, and also through other (LaCie) drives daisy chained to a rear port, and that made no difference. This is very frustrating, and would potentially make me return the drive if I can't find a solution. What could be causing this? 

I'd like to display an RSS feed (updating dynamically of course) on my Windows 7 desktop. The posts I've read about Windows 7 RSS backgrounds are all about displaying various background images delivered via RSS. What I'm looking for would be similar to the Windows XP/95 Active Desktop feature which allowed for web pages to be presented on the desktop background. 

So far though I'm unable to find a spider that can handle #1 and #2. * The site is a bill payment service and it has my bill history. I'm looking to stop using the service but I want to keep the history. 

The Send Page by Email Firefox extension seems to only send X bytes of a web page. Or some portion. UPDATE: I was incorrect. The limitation is that sendemail.exe (which the extension uses to send the email has a 16k limit on the body text passed in.) Where I don't have Firefox, I can only send the link, so no full text search at all in those cases. 

What are others seeing? Update: For W500 owners w/ the 9 cell battery, what value do you see for "Full charge capacity" when on the Battery tab of the Power Manager utility? I see 81.87 Wh. 

I have hyperlinks in some Excel 2010 (both .xlsx and .xls formats) worksheets. If I enable sharing of the workbook I can no longer edit or create hyperlinks - the options no longer exist on the menu and/or are greyed out. How can I fix and/or workaround this? 

If you have a computer setup with iTunes reading from that NAS, then as long as that iTunes is running, you would be able to stream from that library with the Apple TV. You would need to have those movies in its library, but that shouldn't bee too big an inconvenience. 

I have a brand new Western Digital MyPassport Studio, which I'd like to use as a utility drive. It will boot my Mac Pro over USB, but not over FireWire 800. Western Digital's support basically told me it's not their problem, although their knowledge base article states that the drive should boot an Intel Mac over FireWire. It's partitioned like so (using GUID): 

It's not a "pure" Bash solution, but then, Mac metadata isn't pure Unix either. I am calling AppleScript inline: 

I have a file whose extension is .log, though I have this particular file set to open in TextWrangler instead of Console.app (using "Open with" in Finder's Get Info panel). I have a Bash shell script () that uses SED to replace some text in a file, inline, like so: 

Right-click (control-click) the .itlp file in Finder, and Show Package Contents Open the file in a text editor (TextEdit is fine) Open a Terminal window and enter the command Quit and relaunch iTunes Find the tag in the XML file for the first song, and copy its attribute (the part between the quotation marks) Right-click (control-click) the first song in iTunes, and Get Info Because of step 3, the Grouping field will have changed to . Paste the XID copied in step 5 into this field Repeat steps 5 and 7 for each track (if they're listed sequentially in iTunes, you can use the "Next" button in the Get Info window to accomplish this more quickly Once you've assigned the XIDs for all tracks, run the iTunes LP file and everything should work Quit iTunes Open the Terminal window from before and enter the command Quit Terminal Reopen iTunes, and you're all set and back to normal
