Sometimes you can't even click to the point where you want the quote. The issue seems to be to do with the idea that you have a block (1+) characters that are LTR followed by a block that are RTL characters, e.t.c. alternating. And the issue seems to be a kind of philosphical question of whether point A and point B are the beginning/end of that block. Or whether they relate to the previous and next block. If they relate to the previous and next block then you get the funny results. Point B would end a previous block, which in LTR mode is at point A. And Point A would begin the next block, which in LTR mode is at point B. So you can get this wrapping effect. And what happens is any english character typed at point A appears at point B, and any hebrew character typed at point B appears at point A. One may find they can't click on point A, or can't click on point B. Well, then if you want point A, you can try clicking point B, and vice versa. And you may find that a char typed there ends up on the other point which is where you want it. Also it's worth writing blocks of hebrew and english and watching the cursor move through them as you tap the left and right arrow keys. So you can get some idea of where the beginning and end of blocks are. Often it's more about the beginning and end of the block than the beginning and end of the line.. Also as far as what distinguishes LTR mode from RTL mode.. In both cases english goes left to right and hebrew right to left. But in LTR mode if you have adjacent blocks i.e. a block of hebrew a block of english a block of hebrew e.t.c. or a block of english then a block of hebrew then a block of english, the blocks will go from LTR in LTR mode. And RTL in RTL mode. In notepad you also get an alignment to suit it, though some programs e.g. visual studio class file putting data in a list, will order the blocks like that, detecting the hebrew, doing RTL, but still aligning it all to the left. It's still an RTL mode. Also if all your words are hebrew and the only blocks of english are punctuation marks, then if you use RTL mode then there may be less of an issue, because in RTL mode there's no question that end of any block of hebrew characters, will be adjacent with the next block of hebrew characters. 

So just make a bat file with two lines. One with set /p... and one with the replace line. Or just one line 

If you want to have multiple icons on the taskbar, you'll find that if you drag wscript.exe to the taskbar (or a shortcut to wscript.exe or blah.vbs), it makes a wscript lnk the first time, but the second time it doesn't. So what you have to do, is change the target of the shortcut to something different from the existing one, before you drag it. This is the case for anything, so if you have a shortcut for calc.exe, you drag it onto the taskbar and you get an icon for calc.exe there, it works. If you drag the shortcut or further calc.exe shortcuts to it, they don't go on there, you get a no entry sign. To get it to work, just change the shortcut target slighhtly e.g. change c:\windows\system32\calc.exe to c:\windows\system32\calc.exe dfdf Then it will go on the taskbar. You can change the icon too. With wscript, if you want an icon for a.vbs then do wscript a.vbs, as target, drag it on. Do one for wscript b.vbs (by making a shortcut for wscript and changing the target and dragging it on). Its a bit similar with explorer. If you drag a folder onto the taskbar, while it won't stop you, it will try to pin it to explorer. If you want a new icon, then create a shortcut to explorer.exe c:\blah. So just precede the target of the shortcut with explorer.exe and then as it's a shortcut and to a target that no existing shortcut has, it goes on there are a new shortcut. 

I doubt it. Normal behavior is like linux. I think If you want to get the ./myprogram & behaviour in windows, you do But as you say, you don't want that. But the default is (as with linux) not to do that. The fact that your program continues running after the window is shown, suggests to me that this functionality is built into the program, so it executes the window as a new thread. I don't think cmd can stop that. 

turn off automatic bulleting and do it manually. i don't use automatic bulleting ever. it's a second or two to tap a. or 3. and push spaces a few times and possibly hold space for a moment 

The following isn't a great solution as it'd take some time to do but you can draw text boxes. These you can position anywhere and they don't interfere. Use ctrl+arrow keys, to move it about finely. this for example is done with a textbox over text written into a document. This is a screenshot taken from MS word. 

is there any universal software for reading a hard drive image so I know it's ok and don't have to rely in one particular piece of software? like ISO is universal for CDs and if one wanted, one can use one program to make an ISO from a CD, one program to read the ISO, one program to burn the ISO to a cd? Is the same possible with hard drive images? 

Sounds like you have room on the left of the partition you want to extend, and no room on the right. You can move a partition to the left and then extend it to the right. Windows may do that, if not then Easeus partition manager(which is free) or others e.g. paragon partition manager(also free version). You should use specific terminology when talking about something as significant as partitions. When you say OEM partition before the windows 7 partition. Perhaps you mean a Partition of 100MB Windows describes as "System Reserved" If so, I don't know how you ended up with a space between it and your main partition. So I wonder if perhaps you don't mean that But if you backed things up you're free to experiment. Try moving the partition you want to extend to the right, try moving that partition to the left first, then you'll have space on the right extend it. And to be clear, (and particularly when you don't have a pic), write the title of the window you're working in to partition the drive(so that it's clearer what screen you're looking at) e.g. The Windows 7 "disk management" window 

That's like saying that somebody came round to put a TV in your house, and you think you managed to remove it but you're not sure. 

added- any sata hdd or whatever hdd has to be powered itself e.g. from a computer's psu. the power supply going into the board just powers a chip on the board. 

Added It is a question people have on some forums. How to get drivers for Windows 2008 for that motherboard. Looks like, indeed, Windows 2008 is not listed on the intel site for your Motherboard. But, there's hope. This link has sreenshots specifically for dealing with the Ethernet driver. It looks from this webpage(on sparebot.com) like the driver is already there in windows server 2008, and it's just a matter of pointing Windows 2008 server to it- Intel 82579LM Gigabit Network adapter. device manager..right click the ethernet adapter -under "other devices", then..update driver software..pick.. then choose browse rather than search. and network adapters and point to that. $URL$ 

I haven't tested this, but in theory it could be possible. This link $URL$ mentions that "SD File format specificiation, which is downloaded with the SDK. PSD is a complex format. But yes it has a header, followed by chunks of data for layer structure, layer contents, etc. Photoshop does try to read the parts that are readable. But if the header or layer structure is messed up, then there may not be enough info to read much of the file." And there is some software that can try to extract the layers from it $URL$ They have an online tool currently down $URL$ And a command line tool $URL$ $URL$ Another company and program that does Photoshop file recovery is here- $URL$ 

(from what I can tell at least!) anything you drag onto the taskbar, is a shortcut. So whether you drag an EXE, or a VBS or a LNK file, then it if comes up, it comes up as a shortcut on the taskbar. Knowing that, means there's a lot less messing around 'cos a lot less variables to try when things go wrong. You can test that, by moving the mouse over to one of the pinned icons, it doesn't matter that a menu comes up when you hover. Then shift right click. If it says restore, move, size, minimize, maximize, close) then Click Close(which will just close all the windows of it if there are any). if the icon has gone then you didn't choose a pinned icon, so shift right click a pinned icon. And you get a menu whose last option is "properties" and there's a shortcut tab. So it's a shortcut. And that can prove that it is a shortcut.
