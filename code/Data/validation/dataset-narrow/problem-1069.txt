If you build your kernel following the proper procedures for building Ubuntu kernels (I don't know what they are), then when you install the resulting packages you'll get an additional entry in the GRUB boot menu. Your old kernel(s) will still be there unless you explicitly remove them. Recovery mode isn't a special kernel. It just boots a minimal system, using whatever kernel it's paired with. 

I have a Windows 10 laptop with a keyboard designed by idiots. They tried to cram the arrow keys where they don't belong, with the result that the up arrow key is between the right shift key and the / key (US keyboard layout). This is one of the stupidest things the designers could have done, because it means that when I go to hit the right shift key (which is most of the time), I end up hitting up arrow instead. This is incredibly annoying. I found a program called Sharp Keys which allows me to remap the keys such that the up arrow behaves as shift and the right shift behaves as up arrow. Now, at least I can type. However, I've now lost important functionality for the up arrow key. Up arrow (now labeled "shift" on my keyboard) doesn't repeat. So, I can't just hold the key down to move up. Instead, I have to hit the key repeatedly. How can I fix this, so my right shift key behaves like up arrow and my up arrow key behaves like right shift? EDIT Following a suggestion from the comments, I installed AutoHotkey. I have the following script: 

Just installed Windows 8, pinned Notepad to the start screen. When I press the Windows key and use the Notepad tile to run Notepad, it will focus on the currently open Notepad window. I'd like it to start a new instance of Notepad. Is this possible? 

Is this level of customization exposed to the user? I know you can rename shortcuts by going to the Start Menu folder. 

By default, a fresh install of Google Chrome will place an entry on the Start Screen that when clicked will open the Modern UI/Metro version of Chrome. This is frustrating, as I want to have it open in my desktop. Is there any way to fix this? 

Check out the graph of this drive (SSD) to drive (7200 RPM) copy below. When I first started the file copy it bursted up to past 700 MB/sec. Then, after bursting, it flatlines at ~100 MB/s for the duration of the file. How is it able to burst so high? 

I played around with some settings for the desktop and now I want them to be exactly stock. I think the grid size by default is 64x64, but I'm not sure what the grid spacing was set to. Can anyone help? 

After receiving no replies here, I asked this question over on Microsoft's support site. I'm copying the reply I got there, with the one modification I had to make to get it to work. 

I have the same problem as earlier. But, since AHK is a scripting language, is it possible to use it to change the repeat behavior? 

The race condition isn't solved. I tried to put the first iteration outside of the loop, as JJohnston2 did, but it had no observable effect for me. The root cause of all this trouble is that the system doesn't seem to repeat the shift, Ctrl, or Alt keys, even though the others repeat. So, AHK can't repeat what it never sees. Since everyone I've asked for help hasn't had this issue, there must be something funky with my setup, but I don't have the foggiest idea what that might be. 

My primary network connection for a Windows 10 box is a wireless connection to an Android phone. Unfortunately, the phone's wireless tethering is buggy, and often the DHCP lease is incorrect, causing me to be unable to open any new network connections. The specific issue is that the phone doesn't hand out a gateway. My proposed solution to this is to configure the network manually, avoiding DHCP altogether, as every attempt to flash a new ROM on the phone has failed. Which brings me to my question: How can I set manual IP settings for just one wireless network? By setting the IPv4 settings on the network adapter, it appears that it applies to all wireless APs, and not just the one I want to configure. 

I'm trying to set it back to it was when I installed El Capitan. I accidentally grabbed the slider and resized it. 

On my screen you can see that I have two apps in the top left, Scan and Skype, that I want to move into the folders on the right but can't figure out how (right-click open image in new tab to see the image larger): 

I have a chair that I have loved, but it is getting old. I want to get a new chair that is the exact same make and model. Unfortunately, there is absolutely no identifying information on the chair as to who the manufacturer is or where it even came from. Is there a tool online or service I could utilize to find the origin of this chair? 

After getting my hands on a copy of Windows 8, I ran Boot Camp Assistant on my Macbook Air in Mac OS X, and split my drive to install Windows 8. The installation went without a hitch, but now my trackpad and audio are not working, and I can't run the setup for Boot Camp Control Panel to install. Does anyone have a solution to this? 

In addition to mbair's answer, have a look at GParted. It will show you the individual partitions, their names, and any errors, all in a much easier form to understand than or its ilk. 

You should be able to use fdisk to add an extended partition with no trouble. I've done so a number of times in Ubuntu as well as in several other ancient distros. But I prefer the graphical program GParted. It's available as a live CD if you don't have X installed. 

My sole internet connection is via tethering to my Android phone (OnePlus 3). In the past, I used WiFi tethering, and all was fine. However, I've been bitten by a phone bug which results in my phone turning WiFi tethering off every 5 minutes or less. I've configured Tasker to re-enable it, but my work requires a constant connection. All this makes WiFi tethering unworkable for me until my phone gets a bugfix update. In the interim, I've been plugging my phone into my Windows 10 laptop and using USB tethering to internet. This gives me reliable internet, but it causes the situation which is the subject of this question: When I'm connected to the internet via USB, certain Windows features don't work properly: The News and Weather apps take tens of minutes to open and frequently stop responding for a minute or two at a time. The Settings app normally doesn't work at all in the networking sections, and sometimes in the other sections. The taskbar's networking icon takes tens of minutes to reflect the current network status. Older programs (such as the control panel) don't seem to be affected, and Edge mostly works. Command-line tools such as and work perfectly. What's going on? This is an issue for me because I need to tell Windows to treat my USB tethered connection as a metered connection, but the Settings app won't open when I'm using that connection--and for some reason, the network settings available from the control panel and those available through the settings app are different. 

Just built a new machine with an ASUS Maximus VI Hero motherboard which happens to have a newer Intel ethernet controller, model Intel I217-V. I'd like to use the Debian netinstall (debian-7.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso) and somehow get the new driver ($URL$ loaded during the installation process. I'm not really sure how to do this... do I need to bust out the shell during the install and make and install the driver? 

This customization would be nice. Is this possible out of the box, and if not, could a developer modify the start screen to make it possible? 

I always turned off Action Center in Windows 7 - is there anything new in Windows 8 worth keeping it around for? 

I have hosted Exchange right now, with one mailbox containing around 3GB. I'm looking at switching over to Office 365. Can I just change where my Exchange server lives, and all of my stuff will start syncing to the new server? Or do I need to export my stuff, delete the current Exchange server out of Outlook, add the new one, and then import? 

I'd like to remove the tile shown below, without uninstalling the program. It doesn't seem like it is an actual folder that can be removed - maybe it is a registry key?
