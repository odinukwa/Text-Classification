This has the advantage that the statistics are created correctly and do not have to rely on fake values. You can determine the columns of the system generated statistics by running the following statement: 

Given the nature of a transaction log file (TLog has circular VLF usage) you could have a big increase in the snapshots, because all the data in the TLog has been changed. I recommend reading the following articles: Inside the Storage Engine: More on the circular nature of the log Transaction Log VLFs - too many or too few Initial VLF sequence numbers and default log file size and Brent's own Blitz Result: Multiple Log Files on the Same Drive This should give you an idea how a TLog file works and why you might have a sudden increase in your TLog snapshots in Simpana. At our shop, for example, we don't do any de-duplication on the TLog files, because of their nature. In some cases we saw an increase (yes, increase) in size after de-duplication. Summary: If you have large changes in the data, then you would generally have large changes in the TLog files. Even more so with the four times a day backup up strategy. However, if you are just backing up TLog dumps and not actually taking a Simpana TLog backup, then your issue is equally explained with the large amount of changes in the database which result in large amount of circular changes in the TLog. E.g. Your TLog with 4 small VLFs. 0 = no changed data ; 1 = changed data The last VLF has a modified page in second place 

Normally an Access Database file is protected with the account and no password. Solution Enter into the User name: field and leave the Password: field empty. This should work. 

Reference: What is the difference between Rollback and Undo Tablespace?, section Undo vs. Rollback Advisor Framework If you are running in Undo Segements mode then you can retrieve advisory information about the Undo configuration from the system with the following script (Advisor Framework): 

Reference: How much memory does my SQL Server actually need? (SQLSkills.com) There are some other good articles out their that explain how SQL Server uses RAM. 

Try running the job step with a different account Try adding the BUILTIN\Administrators group to your SQL Server instance and provide them with enough privileges to run the sendmail. 

Simpana will create a large snapshot, because all the blocks have changed since the last snapshot. Even if you had a large TLog with lots of space, you would still see a jump in the snapshot size if you have large amounts of data that are modified. 

There was a rare occasion where the logical filename of the database was truncated in SQL Server 2008 R2 You might find more information in the ERRORLOG of the server you are restoring to. Otherwise I would consider running the restore script outside of the scheduled task in Query Window to catch any other errors. 

So in a really far-fetched sense a Threat combined with a Vulnerability could lead to a breach of data in your Table_Data. And as a result you have a Security Risk. Now having all the relevant data referenced in your central table could pose a heightened security risk from your teacher's perspective, but that is very far fetched. 

After you have captured lock escalations and blocked processes you have to determine if the lock escalations are the root cause of the blocked processes: 

And last but not least we have to ensure that Dynamic Ports are disabled. To accomplish this, scroll down to the bottom of the IP Addresses register and set the following settings: 

In the SQL Server Configuration Manager open up the branch for SQL Server-network configuration and select your instance. (E.g. ) Right click and open up the properties. Verify that you don't have any settings that could inhibit a connection. Close the setting when you have finished. In the right hand pane for the protocol settings verify that the TCP/IP protocol is . Now right click the TCP/IP setting and open up the properties. In the Protocol tab... a) Verify again that is set to . b) Verify that the setting is set to . c) The screen should look like this: 

It isn't possible to change a Windows Authenticated SQL Server Login to a SQL Server Authenticated SQL Server Login. One reason being that a Windows Authenticated SQL Server Logins retrieves the SID from Active Directory and stores it in the master database. Another reason is that the backslash () is not a valid character for a SQL Server Authenticated SQL Server Login. 

Well you could run the following query to retrieve the jobs run between two times or you could change the expression to catch jobs that ran for a certain duration. 

Keep your 3rd-party snapshots for disaster scenarios. They are consistent and bring the database back online fast. Have additional FULL, DIFF and LOG backups of your database according to your requirements. Store these backups in a safe place to ensure you can access them when you have to restore a database to either the FULL, DIFF, LOG or Point-in-Time. 

If you find that the permissions are not correct in the log file, then run the following command to grant all permissions to the directory and all underlying sub-directories: 

Right now we don't know the specification of your "Server" so we can't tell if space might become an issue. Apart from that, the answers you are searching for are just a case of interpolating the available data along a time line. Answering your questions: 

The answer is in the bold portion of my answer. Starters You have a table of Lead Managers () and a table for Companies (). A Lead Manager can be in multiple companies and can have multiple Lead Manager roles in one company. Inner Query The inner query retrieves the number of () Lead Manager's Codes () where the Lead_Manager's company code matches ... Outer Query ... the company code () in the Company () table. Result The result should be a list of Company Codes, Founders and distinct count of Lead Managers for each given company. The will only select unique Lead Manager', or put another way: Even if a lead manager has multiple Lead Manager Roles in a company only 1 count will be made for that company. 

You might want to check out my answer here which was posted in response to the question How can I backup an SQL Server database using Windows Server Backup?. It is related to Windows Server Backup and VSS, but touches on some points you might encounter with the VSS backup strategy that has been implemented at your shop. 

DISCLAIMER: This information is provided solely for educational purposes. Deleting data in the base tables can corrupt your database! 

SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) Change the setting in the security section of the properties window to SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode. 

What exactly does is probably an internal call to an object in the sqlserver.exe process or one of its linked libraries. 

Last Resort If all else fails you might want to consider re-installing your whole MySQL environment. 

This is similar to using a as described further down in the page where they recommend using instead: 

Create a SQL file with the script required to run your cleanup job Run the script with sqlcmd.exe and any required parameters Create a Windows Scheduled Task and add the command with all the required parameters 

When you restore a database it contains database users. These users are transported with the database, whenever you perform a backup and a restore to a different SQL Server. On your source and target SQL Servers you will have SQL Server Logins. These logins are either SQL Server accounts (Native SQL Server logins) or they will be Windows Server/Domain accounts (Windows Accounts). SQL Server Logins SQL Server Logins (Native SQL Logins or Windows Accounts) are stored in the master database and have a unique SID assigned to each SQL Login. You can retrieve a list of SQL Server logins when you query the system catalog view . 

I have never installed multiple instances of SQL Server on one HW server except for testing. The above mentioned reasons for multiple instances are more or less true, but if you have huge databases then you might still need multiple HW servers. Two huge advantage of having SQL instances IMO from a production perspective 

Backing up a database involves quite a few parameters, even if you let SQL Server Management Studio do it with your assistance or if you schedule a Maintenance Plan to do it for you. The easiest solution is to verify that the following parameter is set, if you are using the same filen name for every full database backup: 

Start the SQL Server Configuration Manager Right-click the SQL Server Agent (INSTANCE_NAME) service to bring up the properties. In the properties change the service account to start with either your Windows account or switch to "Local System". Close the properties Start the service in Configuration Manager. 

At some point-in-time your Transaction Log backups (and Full backups?) are copied to a network drive and backed up from there by means of a backup solution, possibly combined with some kind of tape and/or disk storage. As soon as the first occurs after the last your previous files are gone... Questions to ask yourself 

Reference: Database-Level Roles (Microsoft Docs) These are similar to the database owner in that they have the same permissions, but are explicitly defined in the database. That is why they are displayed in the security branch of the database. Solution To change the database owner ... Assign new database owner To remove a Database Owner (not the role) you have to assign a new database owner. This can be achieved using the mentioned stored procedure (deprecated) or the syntax. Reference: ALTER AUTHORIZATION (Transact-SQL) (Microsoft Docs) 

Lots of questions so many answers. It depends on so many factors. Budget being one. First of all I would like to point out that visiting some basic SQL Server courses will vastly increase your understanding of SQL Server and its requirements. IMHO switching from Windows Server Administrator to SQL Server DBA is not just something that can be accomplished by querying Google or asking questions in a forum. You can acquire some knowledge, but without the full picture, you are liable to break something in a productive environment. 

Issue 2 This error can also occur on Windows 64-Bit systems where the Desktop Application Heap is too small. Fix for Issue 2 

Explanation Your Oracle instance has a restriction on the maximum amount of sessions allowed. This could be 100, 500, 1000 or even more. Check the parameter of your Oracle instance. 

Click on the Options >> button to display the login windows with Advanced Properties Advanced SSMS Login window Enter your Login and Password for a SQL Server Authentication login or select Windows Authenticated from the pull-down menu to login using your windows account. 

I reckon that the (sys.index_columns) and (sys.stats_columns) are the equivalent of each other and that only the sys.index_columns table has an ordering column, namely . 

There is a slight chance that native backups could encounter an issue when the 3rd-party software triggers the SQL Server VSS Writer service, which mostly results in an message in the SQL Server . Having native backups run at this time could possibly result in errors. Then you have noticed that 

You then start the SQL Server Configuration Manager, navigate to the SQL Server Network Configuration branch and open up to the Protocols for SQLINSTANCE (my picture shows MSSQLSERVER as the instance name) and then you open the TCP/IP properties with a right-click and you will get a screen similar to the below screen shot:
