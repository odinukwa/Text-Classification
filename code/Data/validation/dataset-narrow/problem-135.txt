The meaning of AS Path attribute on the BGP protocol is a way to the router to know how far is some network located. If you are studying BGP, i guess you are familiar with RIP, OSPF, ISIS and so on. RIP works by hops, router know how to reach network by hops, OSPF works with bandwith, with someting called cost, on the reference of the link bandwiths that the networks are connected, well, BGP works with the AS-PATH, bigger or shorter AS-PATH, is something like the way to reach some networks. If some networks are marked with red and another with green, i think this is to show you what is the best i guess, here i dont see thats colors, on routers only see wich is the best, which are valid routes and that kind of stuff. Here you can fin how BGP makes a selection of the best route to work: $URL$ On your reading, you will see where it looks the "AS PATH". And, on reference to "broadcast to his neighbors",.. remember, broadcast is the mechanins to send the same info to all equipments in SOME NETWORK. BGP neighbors are mainly on different network, but if you want to say that the router send learned networks to other BGP neighbors, the you are rigth. 

Do you had set the gateway on your computers?? I guess: 192.168.10.50 One question: It is a real scenario?, or is just some simulation for testing purpose. The thing is that from internet, it must not know the existence of network 192.168.10.0/24. From internet cloud, must exist a route to 192.168.10.0/24 destination, across 10.0.1.50/16. With that conf, your scenario must work. 

This is your configuration. You need to configure the host and one port of the switch that connect to the host one the same vlan(23). Then, on the other switch, the 2 ports need to be on another same vlan(24). Finally, do the same with the other port and the server port(vlan25). All port must be configured like ACCESS-PORTS. Remember that 

Thats can only be done by an user with more priviledges than you, it´s like root user and normal users, root can change what a normal user see. But if you have the enable password,.. you can try. By the way, the command is: 

ADDED: If your router is a VM, you need to create a portgroup like trunk port and permit all the vlans, then, connect your VM on that port group. That´s all 

There only exist 65536 ports (from 0 to 65535), one of then located by the IANA into well known ports(lower to 1024), registered ports(from 1024 to 49151, that can be used by any application) and private or dynamic ports (from 49152 to 65535 assigned dynamically to a cliento who iniciates the connection). If you, THEORETICALLY, will be a lot of CPU and RAM on your equipment, from one port, you only will be able to entablish 65536 sockets. 

That means that ISP will be on dificulty to expand services to users who needs communicate with its own IP, i guess. Ex: You want to get a dedicated line with its own IP range and be on charge of that, on this way, and if we look that we ran out of IPv4, the expansion will be dificult. More, one users maybe want to connect also some devices, and not only one, and equipments configured with NAT, only could accepted a fixed number of devices peer IP pool configured, if you want to provide a acceptable QoS in your service. 

You need to remember that on a etherchannel, on bot switches you can balance the data you want to transmit (there is no problem if exist differences of the algorithm on bot ends)if you do that on bot ends, you will be getting a load balance on your link. By other hand, to choose the correct algorithm, you need to think on the form that data is transmited, if source is one ip, on mac-address, destination is one ip, one mac-address, to get the correct load balance method. Eg, if the source you will be getting it is a great number of ip, i think you can tried with src-ip, if you will be getting a lot of differents mac, src-mac if what you need. This is the trick for load balance, and the reason why we sometimes put a correct configuration, and we don't see nothing of load balance on our etherchannel links. Remember, router changes mac address and put it owns like mac address source on outbound packets, that's it, if a lan is connected to a router, and then behind a router is are connected your switches and your etherchannel, i guess you will NOT get a great differences of mac address... 

Of course they can't ping each other, they are on different network, if you want to do that , you need to create son mechanism that do some kind of routing. The thing is, without routing, the communication only will be able between PC on the SAME vlan, because vlans divide the space into broadcast domains, in other words, NETWORKS, one vlan means one NETWORK. On your question, you have 2 networks. Create one vlan interface 50 with ip 10.1.50.1/24, and one vlan interface 60 with ip 10.1.60.1/24. Then, one PC on vlan 50, put your gateway on 10.1.50.1, and on the other PC on vlan 60, to 10.1.60.1. Finally, ACTIVATE IP routing on switch With that, ping should be succefull. 

Can you manage your switches?? Let me explain, can you log in into your switches and write commands on it?. If you can do that, you can, eg, ping from your PC to the IP address that is eating your bandwidth, then, like someone said before, check: 

Take the language that you prefer and write some script, eg, python, and install dependencies needed for ssh or telnet connections, this is your choice. 

I think the before comment is rigth. You have two vlans, with two vlan interfaces, to do routing in your swicht, you should send the next hope to your vlan interfaces in the network that you have the destination set routing-instances MGMT-6 routing-options static route 10.0.0.0/23 next-hop 10.0.0.1 Because 10.0.0.1, seems to be the ip address of your vlan interfaces of your VLAN DATA 

Then, the only thing you need to do is to declare is the gateways and a DEFAULT route on rocheford to reach chimay and HOST and so on, eg: 172.16.2.2 or 172.16.3.4 

Create your blackholing process with your ISP B, eg, communities or something else. With that, your ISP B will continue announcing your routes to the world, and once detect traffic to your /32 attacked network, that traffic will be blackholed. I think you have some mechanins to announcing your routes to your ISP(i´m supposing your are using BGP). Once your network is under attack, easily you can do some routing policy, to change yoour ISP-A routing. The prepending is a good choice, you select the network prefix, and put it a bigger as-path through ISP-A. With that, world will know the existence of your attacked netwrok across 2 ISP, but BGO will decide to use the "shortest" AS-PATH, ISP-B, where your networrk under attack will be protected and that traffic will be route to a null route. 

The only way that one Vlan interfaces came UP is to associated with some interface of that switch, this is the only way. I guess, this is the problem that you have. Here you can find the datasheet for your 2690 switch: $URL$ Are supported up to 4096 Vlan ID on that switch, on the way that you can do what you are asking, i guess, first you need to clear the capabilities of your equipment, and next, configure what you want. 

Your setup this like you described is something called "router on a stick", you can search on the internet by the topic "inter vlan routing". The thing is that is you already configure your scenario, and on host or devices connected to it respective vlans, already have it gateway, you must be able to communicate devices between vlans. But to reach the internet, here is where you need to do some configuration. 

By the data that you give us, this one is an interesting part. Unless you had change the neighbors for your safety, and put the conf here, i think you need to explaind why your iBGP neighbor has the same IP address of your UPDATE SOURCE? This one is like if your iBGP share your same host. 

You have 192.168.10.0/24 and 10 departments: Firts, i will suppose that you don' t have any requirement about your address space, because i will give you the basic answer. What you need to do its subnetting looking 10 different networks> You need to remember that there is a rule for that: (2^n) where n is the number of bits If you take 3 bits: 8 networks, NOT If you take 4 bits: 16 networks, YES 192.168.10.0000 0000 the last octet it is in bit notation 192.168.10.0000 0000 192.168.10.0001 0000 192.168.10.0010 0000 192.168.10.0011 0000 192.168.10.0100 0000 192.168.10.0101 0000 192.168.10.0110 0000 192.168.10.0111 0000 192.168.10.1000 0000 192.168.10.1001 0000 192.168.10.1010 0000 192.168.10.1011 0000 192.168.10.1100 0000 192.168.10.1101 0000 192.168.10.1110 0000 192.168.10.1111 0000 The part of the octet that i has write in bold form, that bits now will be part of network, and ther your mask will move to 28. On that way, you have your 10 required networks and 6 networks more. Then your network will have 2^n -2 host, cause the first address is your networks address and the last is your broadcast address. Every network will have then 14 hosts.
