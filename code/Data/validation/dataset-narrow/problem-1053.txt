I looked up that OS:SCAN V=5.05 and I found this $URL$ The following below, is straight from that nmap link above. Notice it also has the string V=5.05BETA1 So, output very similar to yours When Nmap Fails to Find a Match and Prints a Fingerprint When Nmap detects that OS detection conditions seem ideal and yet it finds no exact matches, it will print out a message like this: No OS matches for host (If you know what OS is running on it, see $URL$ ). 

note- I prefer davidgo's answer to mine. And I don't disagree with him. So please accept his over mine. 

This was caused by a process using too many handles. In my case googledrivesync. This was visiile in task manager under 'performance' I saw about 186,000 handles in use. I made the handle column visible in task manager. Saw it was a googledrivesync.exe process using 400K RAM but 186K or 176K handles. I end tasked it and then browsing was fine. 

try or netstat -aon>a then you have a file of IPs among other info and you just want the IPs now run that grep command I gave you on it and you get just the IPs or this 

It looks like you can't use question mark or any wildcard in that a==b line The == operator doesn't take ? as special, it takes it as literal. And it doesn't look at filenames either. So, that just goes to prove it really does just take ? as literal. Also, in Linux if you did echo ? it would be interpreted by the shell before it goes to the echo command and it would return a filename of one char length. In Windows ? or * are not interpreted by the shell, they are passed to a command. DIR uses ? and *, treats them as special, ECHO doesn't, and the test for equality if == doesn't, and it would just echo a question mark. I doubt what you wrote there would be valid in bash either. As in linux ? and * are always to do with filenames and you seem to want purely for the variable comparison. 

I open a cmd prompt start..cmd I get no prompt so one might think it's not running with administrative privileges. But I can create a file on Why would that be? What setting is it that would cause that lack of a prompt? 

You can't write a file to unless cmd is administrative. You can load it as administrative, or you could just write a file to a directory you make, instead of to . So you can do this without loading cmd as administrative. try 

Here's the file as a docx $URL$ or from ge.tt $URL$ though that can easily be created just by having some text and highlighting part of it . And that's just a demonstration file, I may have lots more text and lots more blocks of text highlighted. I don't want an MHT file 'cos firefox doesn't open it straight away, and if I want to send it to somebody then I think an html file is more compatible. I can get Word to produce an html webpage but then it makes a subdirectory with these xml files in it. I don't want that, I want one file. 

this is really easy to troubleshoot. first make sure the program is running on the port. So do the command 

the way is to do "port forwarding" on your NAT/NAPT device. There must be thousands of article and videos about port forwarding all over the web. The harder way is SSH But what I wrote above is a more direct answer to your question. 

It is saved as ANSI in notepad. And when opened in a browser, it displays some hebrew characters fine. Note, Chrome can handle UTF-8 just as well and it can be copied into Ms Word 2010 just as well. 

you can copy/paste them from excel into notepad that can easily save as plain text. If you get one link per line then save that file as e.g. blah.a and download wget then it's no longer an excel thing. so now say you have produced a file of links then you can use a command called wget (which you'd have to download and has nothing to do with excel). So let's say each line of the file has a line like $URL$ So then you do wget -i blah.a and then it will download each link there.. but you should also include a delay so it doesn't bog down the server so but with something like -t -T and -w.. e.g. (retries, timeout and wait respectively), so setting things like retry and timeout and wait. So Obviously this is in wget --help. (with even more detail in the wget manual that is online). You can get wget with e.g. cygwin. 

There are two cases of a port opening..i.e. a port coming into existence. That ID being created for use. One is when a program initiates a connection, and the other is when a program is listening for a connection. The listening happens first. When it comes to making a program listen for a connection, you can often tell the program which port to listen on. Usually the program will give you the option. You can try this yourself by setting up what is called a "server".. There are different definitions of server.. One is a rather powerful computer, another is a central computer that might be accessed by many others, or even be used to access many others. And another definition - the main definition - is a piece of software that listens for others to connect (often potentially many others to connect), so you see other definitions of server spring from that one. You can create a server.. set one up Tinyweb is a little web server Instructions are on this website $URL$ so create c:\blah\index.html it can even be blank. this makes it listen on port 8000 

Reason is Speed. Also a process can grow while it runs, like k-meleon. Or spawn new processes while it runs like chrome.exe. Cache memory is faster than RAM which is faster than disk. So things get put in cache where cache is available. Ideal is if CPU is executing things in cache. Second to that is if it's executing things in RAM. CPU never processes things on disk, it doesn't address things on disk, it only addresses RAM locations or no doubt, cache locations. Or locations that read/write to devices. It's not like everything even everything you might want to run is swapped out to disk and then back to RAM. Only Things not currently being used and not likely to be used soon are preferred when swapping things out, so as to free RAM up for things that are more in use. Web browsers have a cache too, a disk cache! They store things locally on disk, rather than fetch from from online. There are web proxies that you can run locally that store a website locally and if it changes online then it will fetch. This enables you to browser much quicker. (though I suppose you can run into the problem of a website not specifying properly that a change was made, and you get stuck loading an old copy from your local disk cache) but the idea is that it's faster. In that situation the quicker area is the local hard disk and the slower area is the remote/online area. You do this kind of swapping in life, with things you need near you, and things you don't need in storage. You don't put everything in storage/garage arguing that there's loads of room in storage/garage. It'd be too slow. 

I like media player classic because it has built in support for showing milliseconds. I would like to be able to move frame by frame I have heard that left and right should move frame by frame, but it's clearly not, it's jumping many seconds It's MPC version 1.7.10 64bit Here's a sample mp3 though 11 seconds enter link description here If I pause it at 0:00.000 and I push the right arrow then it jumps to 0:05.000 so it jumps 5 seconds! 

I've tried shift-right clicking the wscript icon, going to properties, and choosing another icon, and clicking apply, but the taskbar icon doesn't change. See below, I told it to change to the icon for That pinned vbs file to \windows\system32\calc.exe and clicked apply - notice at least a calculator icon in the properties window, but the taskbar icon has still not changed. 

when I go to forums, chrome will ask if it wants to remember the password I say yes. and if I log out of the forum it fills it in for me and I just click log in. this doesn't seem to be the case with this superuser site. 

then on chromebook, So the remote pi had done an SSH -R creating port 16864 on the localpi. He was already able to get a terminal to his raspberry pi, doing We added a -L to open port 5678 on his localpi, so he can then connect from a device e.g. chromebook, to his localpi, which goes to his remotepi which forwards to a web server on itself/his remote pi. So there are two ssh commands in total. The one from his remote pi to his localpi. And one from his localpi to his remotepi. We just amended the second one, the one from his localpi to his remotepi. To tunnel to a web server on his remote pi. It is actually tunneling through a tunnel. 

I recently saw one with a 50pin 3.3V IDE, apparently that is rare though. If you know what laptop it is then you could look it up possibly. But it's a good question of what does one find in there. common ones uncommon ones e.t.c. there is such a thing as mini SATA aka mSATA. there is slim-sata. Apparently $URL$ at the time of that article sept 2009 , slim sata was common, and at the time of that article, mini SATA was coming. There are cables converting between SATA mSATA mini SATA. If it was 2.5" IDE you'd want an adaptor to convert that to 3.5" and an adaptor kit(probably any good USB-IDE adaptor) to convert that to USB. I suggest having a good USB-IDE adaptor and add a bunch of cables to the box and have other small adaptors about possibly put them in the box with it. 

That worked, it produced a file that was 6s 26ms So that is very much to the nearest second. as opposed to the one with -vcodec copy and -acodec copy, that was 10.4 seconds. It works 

You can look at what interpretation is most likely.. and it's far more likely that by It, it doesn't mean processor. It's absurd to think it does. It's ridiculous to interpret it the way you have and say it's wrong. For example, if you think that by CPU it means processor, / that "it" means processor, then it'd be saying that the processor contains a processor. Or, the other absurd interpretation you come up with, that the processor contains main memory (it doesn't). One consideration is this - Well, there are two different definitions of CPU. An old fashioned one that I saw in British A-Level Computing textbooks when I last checked some in 1998-2000, that defined CPU as the computer case. The box. Most people are very unfamiliar with that definition of CPU. Or with that ever being a definition of CPU. And even many people that have been in computing for a long time are unfamiliar with that definition. Note- commenter "Class Stacker" who is probably based in America, has seen definition used in the past too, and also on international projects he has worked on. And the definition that people are more familiar with nowadays, which is CPU as processor. Another consideration is this. The "It" in the last sentence. 

Perhaps you could even do it from c:\ to some other internal drive or some usb drive e.g. to e:. i.e. C is running. I haven't tried it. You could try that and if that fails then do it from USB to USB booting from your internal/C drive. robocopy is the successor to xcopy. xcopy was funny with attributes, resetting read only unless told otherwise, and it has no progress bar. robocopy by default copies all files including hidden and system files and copies attributes, and robocopy has a progress bar, which is also by default(though it's just a per file progress bar). 

That is a good idea for a future windows version. You could call MS Customer services and see if they listen! In the meantime, try asking in the Autohotkey forum And also in the meantime, One thing you could do, is if a program intercepts the windows clipboard when text is involved, -and- doesn't put it in the windows clipboard and puts it in its own clipboard only. Then when you copy/paste a file, it puts it in the windows "clipboard". Then that'd be close to what you want. As one hotkey would paste text the other would paste a file. Another possible way is if an alternative to windows clipboard is "powerful" enough, then it would allow copy/pasting of files. In which case, it might be able to do that or close to it e.g. do it but not quite as simply as control-v but pretty efficiently. 

I am not sure if it's most up to date, as I don't see paste listed here, which is where I guess i'd look to update 

At one time there was ANSI escape sequences, but even those which could get different colours, couldn't. There were some commands you could do it in debug, and win7 32bit comes with debug, you could do e.g. -f b800:0 FA0 21 CE` to send bytes to VRAM - video ram, and get different colours of flashing text. But not different font sizes. (or different fonts). It's definitely impossible as command line output, but may be possible from within a program in cmd.exe just liek a game can. But the two well known command line web browsers don't do it, and maybe none exist. But I wouldn't rule it out. One reason why one might not exist is that implementing HTML is a project in itself, including margins for example, and it's not likely to be done just for headers / the H tag. Something like would've shown in DOS, and I think in cmd.exe 32bit (I have a non 64-bit xenon2 that I can't test in my 64bit win7 but I might have run in win7 32bit or more likely with dosbox). But I think nobody has implemented what you ask, as HTML support might require some standard fonts as well, so maybe it's quite a bit of work to do that graphics in cmd, and it hasn't been done. (that kind of graphics, desktop publishing like graphics might've been done in a desktop publishing app, but I never used one and it hasn't been done for html. If it existed then it'd be more well known than lynx or links) 

Notice a pin is missing on the HDD, pin 20 (as the pinout shows). Once you have the cable aligned correctly, don't forget to stick a bit of toothpick into pin 20 on the cable so you can plug it in right every time easily and without any concern.
