I found that in my case of trying to sneak a zipped EXE, I had to change not only the first two bytes (known as "the magic number"), but also a sequence of bytes spelling out the zipped filename. For example, the original ZIP began with , designating a zipped file: 

How do new leechers get to download, then, since they have no pieces to upload? Optimistic unchoking: 

I only have Windows 7 Home Premium, not Professional, so the mirroring option isn't available in Computer Management. Are there any good alternatives? It's possible RAID 1 is overkill for what I'm trying to do, so please do speak up if there's a non-RAID alternative that might work. I just want to be able to store away files every once in a while (once every couple of months or so), locally (not online), and have them duplicated, in case one drive fails. I wanted to use RAID 1 so I wouldn't have to drag-and-drop everything twice, nor have to make sure I've copied everything identically. Finally, ideally, the duplication would happen "as-it-copies," so I wouldn't have to worry about waiting for a second drive "syncing" up separately. Thanks for any suggestions! 

One more thing. If, perchance, upon "cancellation" (a "broken chord"), you'd like to issue the first keystroke, i.e. CtrlE on its own, simply add that in the block, 

—nor can you even get away with doing both, because no matter what, you'll miss the while blocking for input. Then I looked into documentation on for inspiration. The custom combination operator, , seemed promising. But unfortunately, 

It's possible that is interpreting that line as a case label. Try playing around with the according to $URL$ 

To adapt this to Shift instead of Ctrl, you'd have to replace the s, remove the , and do a simpler comparison like instead of the . Not sure how to extend this to and but you might have to try or something of the sort. Explanation seemed like an obvious place to begin. asks AHK to wait for user input, e.g. 

So, there you have it—"chords" in AutoHotkey. (Although, I wouldn't exactly call this a "chord." More like a melody, with a bass line ;-) 

I live in California, and I'm trying to get to New York's AAA site so I can manage membership for my family, who's in New York. Instead, I get redirected to California's AAA, and the AAA Locations and Not your club? are limited to locations within California. Presumably my location is being detected via IP address. 

So, naturally, I tried uninstalling the driver. But, then, I cannot install the new driver without restarting my computer. And when I restart my computer, the default driver is already halfway through installation by the time I get back to the Device Manager dialog, putting me back to square one. Is there a way to get around the "The best driver software for your device is already installed [...] Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date" prompt and force installation of an older driver? 

I want to use Remote Desktop on Windows 7 with multiple monitors (as opposed to spanning), and I understand that both ends need to be running Windows 7 Ultimate or Enterprise editions. (Or, Windows Server 2008 R2.) But how does hardware limit the maximum number and resolution of monitors? For example, the graphics cards on the host (if that's the correct term) can't have anything to do with the display on the client, can it? But, going further then, are the only limitations basically what's allowed by the protocol (in the O/S) and/or configured by local/group settings? Or are there actual hardware-dependent limitations (excluding network-related, i.e. bandwidth). Let's make the question more concrete. I inherited a gamer's desktop computer with 4 DVI ports (that can supposedly support up to 8 monitors via DVI splitter cables), and I want to use this computer to work remotely from the other coast. What exactly do I need to find out about (1) my host machine, (2) my client machine, and/or (3) my company's infrastructure and settings, for someone to tell me definitively, "You can support up to __ monitors of __ x __ resolution."? Thanks very much in advance. (Also, please note that I do try to accept answers; unfortunately for 3 of 5 questions I've asked, there have not been any suitable answers to accept thus far.) 

I purchased a Thinkpad 570, downgrading RAM to 4 GB, and from SSD to HDD, so that I could buy my own components cheaper than Lenovo was charging for upgrades. While waiting for parts, I started using the laptop anyway. It is, expectedly, horrible. Chrome alone easily maxes out the RAM, and it freezes for a few seconds, every few minutes. If I have YouTube or Twitch tabs open, then literally every 30 seconds. I assume this is because of paging. But I noticed that once it freezes, if I move my mouse over the Windows 10 taskbar, it always unfreezes the very instant the mouse hovers over. I also noticed this with other applications, e.g. ExpressVPN, Simplenote. And it's not just "coincidence" or seeming like the trick works—over the past few days, I've gotten into the habit of flicking my cursor over to the taskbar whenever an application freezes, because the application definitely wakes up when the mouse contacts the taskbar, 100% of many, many trials. I'm just curious, if there's anyone knowledgeable in O/S design, Windows 10, paging, etc.: Why would hovering my mouse over the taskbar suddenly wake up the application? 

Is there a way to make Notepad++ auto-complete words on Tab instead of Enter? Currently, if want to type, say, , then Enter to begin a new line, instead the Enter will select the first auto-complete suggestion, like :      I do want the auto-complete feature, but I'd rather have a key like Tab do the actual selection, because Enter is frequently purposed toward starting a new line, whereas Tab is rarely used to indent after a word (since indenting is usually done at the start of lines), and so perhaps would be better repurposed toward auto-completion. 

Now we've got a message box on pressing CtrlE then CtrlC. But there's a problem with this: the message box triggers even when I release Ctrl between the two keystrokes. So, how do we detect essentially a mid-input? You can't merely check on entrance— 

Background I just wanted to upgrade from my 250GB SSD to a 750GB SSD—both happen to be the same make and model, in fact. I used EaseUS Backup, selecting the "Optimize SSD" and "Sector by Sector" options. It finished in about an hour. When attempting to boot from the new drive, BIOS did detect the device, listing it under bootable devices, but selecting the device only led back to the boot menu. I read that cloning can fail under certain conditions, but that usually fixing the MBR would resolve the issue. So all this time, I've just been trying to fix the MBR on the new drive,. 

As @Travis points out, there doesn't appear to be a shortcut for changing themes. You can do it in AutoHotkey though, by copy-pasting the following into its configuration file: 

Finally! In case this answer gets flagged as suspicious: I have nothing to do with EaseUS, and it's only by coincidence that I also stumbled across their partitioning product to solve my issue. When I viewed my disks in EaseUS Partition Master Free Edition, I saw that the new disk had "(GPT)" next to it, where other disks had "(MBR)". GPT stands for GUID Partition Table, and is used by Apple computers. Indeed, I salvaged this SSD from a 2009 Macbook Pro. 

@hippibruder generously points out that I can avoid defining by using to make non-blocking. This allows some simplification! (See tl;dr section at top for final result.) 

Hit Fn+F11, especially if you've got an Acer or HP. Hold both shift keys simultaneously for a few seconds. Update your BIOS. 

makes sure the shortcuts only trigger while Notepad++ is the active window, so as not to have unexpected behavior while other windows are active. defines an action for Alt+1. stands for Alt, for Ctrl, for Shift, and for Win. They can be combined (order insignificant) like this: for Ctrl+Shift+k. brings up the "Settings" menu. selects "Style Configurator..." resets the selected theme to the top item (so as to always count from the top). or selects themes by cycling through by starting letters. You can also use a bunch of s, but that's more prone to breaking when styles are added or removed from the list. seven times brings us to Save and Close, after which we hit . 

I upgraded to 32 GB of RAM, and no longer have this issue, though I'm still on a 7200 RPM HDD. This supports my theory that it was a paging issue. I also noticed before the upgrade that my cursor specifically had to be over one of the tasks on the taskbar, for that task to unfreeze. I don't know how to prove this, but my theory is that hovering the mouse over a task initiates a thread to generate a window preview, which in turn places that task at a higher priority slot in the scheduler. Without this scheduler boost, it was stuck in a lower-priority queue due to its having been paged. (Though, I would imagine paging schedulers use some form of MRU prioritization algorithm, so I don't know why the task was deprioritized so much...)
