a good tutorial for netstate commands NETSTATE COM i know it is a very hard way to do so but it is free of charge 

so for me running dynamic routing protocol over two ISPs is better than use DDNS , because the only thing you will bay is equipment able to run BGP but it will be once and for all instead of monthly fees for internet and DDNS hosting. and also connection is more secured and link speed and quality will be better than

there is no such problem in follow the normal network hierarchy (routing traffic is 80% of the allover traffic and the switching traffic is 20%), so you will create separate VLAN for all servers which will be your server farm , and depend on the specification divide each user group (access same resources , share same functionality ) in separate VLANs 

A very quick (and therefore incomplete) answer: Assuming all of the inside stuff is on the same subnet the ICMP messages are switch2 saying "I don't need to be involved in this, talk to the firewall directly". What I've usually done for these situations is set up a transit subnet between the inside router (switch2) and the firewall so that switch2 can route to something that's not on the internal subnet. It also gives you a choke point where you can monitor and control traffic leaving your internal network. I wouldn't recommend static routes on servers in this situation. It's just a pain to manage and adds unneeded complication. 

Both have VSAT options that involve a lot of "spoofing" similar to what Riverbed does on the WAN. They'll terminate the TCP connection at the earth-terminal on each end to make the client think things are faster than they are. 

On IOS you can enter control-v to escape the next character. This lets you enter a question mark without pulling up help. Don't if that works on ASA but might be worth a try. 

I can't speak to Option 43 being ignored but can you put in a DNS entry for CISCO-CAPWAP-CONTROLLER.domain-given-by-dhcp and point it at 10.19.3.209? That should let them unicast to the controller. 

the difference is that ;if you use trunk mode , , automatically the native vlan will pass through the link with the allowed vlans . so you will get OTHER vlan on the trunk . but when you use access mode you made sure that only one vlan will pass through the link. please make use of this link 

this traffic also could be treated by quality of service (QOS) so simply if PC_1 make traffic to PC_2 (ping for example) and you could obtain the information of source mac , source IP , destination mac , destination IP , this traffic is UDP or TCP , this traffic QOS is best effort for example you successfully made network analyses but lets say cloud network analyses not simply as this example it could include more information like application type and number of sessions payload of each session and so on if you want to see demo of network analyses obtained from real data center may you access ORION live demo 

Network traffic is a very generic word , so shortly if you want to dig this field you need to understand two main things. 

No. The native VLAN on a trunk means that: A) Any untagged frame arriving on the trunk will be treated as being in the native VLAN (regardless of what VLAN it was in on the sending switch). B) Frames on the native VLAN will cross the trunk untagged. In your example a frame arriving on the default VLAN (VLAN 1) will be forwarded out the trunk port on VLAN 1. Since VLAN 2 is the native VLAN that means the frame on VLAN 1 will be tagged. The only way a layer-2 switch will ever move a frame from one VLAN to another is if something is misconfigured. You could misconfigure it intentionally but in my opinion it would still be wrong. 

I'm fairly certain that when the router forwards the DHCP request it includes only the primary network configured on the interface. I don't believe there's any way to have it use the secondary network. Edit: I did some Googling and determined what others have already pointed out, there's a feature called smart-relay that can use the secondary network, but only after the primary times out three times. The relevant quote from Understanding and Troubleshooting DHCP in Catalyst Switch or Enterprise Networks - Cisco Systems 

you can use some sort of of small business call agent (i.e. Cisco call manager express CME) in both sides which can handle Voip calls over WAN and local,mobile and international calls through PSTN and if you want to obtain small call center it has call center express as well but it is licensed feature. you also can use open source call agent like Asterisk and register those GW on it if you don't want to bay any equipment other that your IP phones you can join ISP which can run telephone service on it , which is called ITSP, ITSP will handle all VOIP feature you need (i.e. dial peers , route patterns , conferences , auto attendance and so on) please check this link VOIP INFO 

so router it self won't handle any routing regard the VPN or additional VPN connections because pfsense will handle it . router will just has a default route to the firewall to access any network in the other side . so router won't involve in creating new VPN over new ISP , pfsense will 

pc2 could reach PC1 cause the pc2 GW (which is R2) can reach PC1 (cause it is directly connected to the both network). so same way let us ask a very importent question . what is the PC1 GW and do PC1 GW know about subnet 192.168.2.X or not ????????? if PC1 GW is the modem so you must add static route on the modem tell it if you want to reach 192.168.2.X you should go to 192.168.1.2 . otherwise you need to set the GW of PC1 to be 192.168.1.2 

I think the answer is that switches don't care about VLANs in other switches. The boundaries created by a VLAN only apply on that switch. In this case it sounds like an access port on VLAN 10 in the core switch is plugged into an access port in either VLAN 20 or 30 in the switch with the ACE. Since they're access ports there's no tagging and while I would consider that a misconfiguration and "wrong" it will work just fine as a way to bridge VLAN 10 and the other VLAN. Since VLANs 20 and 30 are bridged explicitly by the ACE that makes all three VLANs into one broadcast domain. You might think of the VLANs as ethernet hubs. Each VLAN is a hub, a broadcast domain. The bridge statement in the ACE connects the 20 and 30 "hub" and turns them into one domain so they can see each other. There is obviously something connecting 10 into the one of the others as well but there isn't enough info to know what. Probably it's an access port with each end in a different VLAN or it's a trunk port with "mismatched" default VLAN. Bonus info because hubs aren't common anymore: In the olden days people used hubs for ethernet connections (when they weren't hiding from dinosaurs). Computers were plugged into hubs and each hub was a broadcast domain (and a collision domain but we're not going there). VLANs didn't exist so each hub was it's own domain and computers plugged into hub 20 couldn't see other computers that were plugged into hub 30 unless the two hubs were connected by running a cable between them (a crossover cable because MDIX didn't exist yet). 

to be aware of the whole image this topic is technical speaking about logical items accomplish certain tasks not existed devices , where bridge is the device which has two ports , those two ports will share the same collision domain and the repeaters are the devices which detect certain signal (which suffered from some degradation) and amplify it and send it again . now a days the existing device are the switches which is multi port bridge (share the same broadcast domain on the base of VLANs) and when you read any configuration guide of any product some time you can see its describe the switch as abridge .repeaters are existing only on the wireless setup (actually it is Access point configured as repeater) where it can spread the coverage on a far location than which the access point is setup. 

route add X.X.X.X mask Y.Y.Y.Y Z1.Z1.Z1.Z1 metric 10 route add X.X.X.X mask Y.Y.Y.Y Z2.Z2.Z2.Z2 metric 20 wher Xs are your lan ip range and Ys are the mask and Z1s are the primary GW and Z2s are the secondry one 

the port you are specking about called controller and for 30 it will be E1 . its format will be something like E1 0/0/0 . so by issue sh controllers E1 you will get some thing like E1 0/0/0 is up. [Omitted] E1 0/0/1 is down. [Omitted] the UP one is the CONNECTED one to check the status of the ISDN ,issue the command sh isdn status Global ISDN Switchtype = primary-net5 ISDN Serial0/0/0:15 interface dsl 0, interface ISDN Switchtype = primary-net5 Layer 1 Status: ACTIVE Layer 2 Status: TEI = 0, Ces = 1, SAPI = 0, State = MULTIPLE_FRAME_ESTABLISHED Layer 3 Status: 0 Active Layer 3 Call(s) Active dsl 0 CCBs = 0 The Free Channel Mask: 0xFFFF7FFF Number of L2 Discards = 0, L2 Session ID = 6 Total Allocated ISDN CCBs = 0 the most importunate here ,the status of layer 1 which active indicating that connection is establish and every thing going well 

To my knowledge (which is not advanced) directionality is generally a function of the antenna so I suppose that you could use separate transmit and receive antennas such that one could be directional and the other omnidirectional. Another alternative would be beamforming, which is a signal-processing technique that seems to be simulating directionality in software. 

There's really no reason not to put multiple subnets on the same VLAN, but there's also probably no reason to do it. Pro: 

We generally don't do it because of the messiness and lack of security. One VLAN = one subnet is easier to document and easier to troubleshoot and there's usually not a good reason to complicate things. The only reason I can think of to do it is company mergers or network upgrades and for both of those I'd prefer it to be temporary. Edit to clarify, for the hosts on different subnets but the same VLAN to talk directly you'd need to either make them their own default gateway or add a route to the "other" subnet that connects it to the interface. In the gateway case if the host IP was 10.1.1.2 then the gateway would also be 10.1.1.2. This will cause the host to ARP for everything on or off it's subnet. This would allow it to talk to the second subnet on that VLAN but the only way it'll be able to talk to anything else is if there's a router/firewall running proxy arp that can help it out. In the route out the interface case you'd add something like "route add -net 192.56.76.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 eth0" to the device and then 10.1.1.2 will ARP directly on eth0 when it wants to reach 192.56.76.*.
