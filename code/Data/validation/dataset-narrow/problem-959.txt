It seems unlikely. This appears to be the only site currently offering a (partial) view of the inside of the Pixel. The instructions on disassembly have been taken down "temporarily", but until an enthusiast dismantles one this the best chance to find out if the SSD is integrated to the mainboard or is a removable module. There are chips visible in the photograph, which seem likely to be RAM (though I can't find the exact number anywhere online). EDIT: It appears that there is a single flash memory chip just to the left of the USB ports, with a circular white sticker on it. If the SSD is indeed on the motherboard, you would only be able to upgrade with external storage. An MSATA card cannot be used to upgrade because the mini-pcie port that holds the WLAN card is not wired for this. Some discussion, here. 

It is difficult to tell you anything certain in situations like these, but data packages, phones, mobile broadband modems and other similar devices normally come with a 14 day "cooling off" period, during which you can back out, cancel your contract and get a full refund. It may be worth seeing if your supplier had such an arrangement, and if it does, you could buy and try the services you are interested in. Above all, before you pay any money, make certain that if you're not happy, you can return the device/cancel the contract. I had a similar experience with 3G 4 years ago, and since I was not able to get coverage at my house, I was able to return the device and get a full refund. 

Your error message suggests a problem, the file you are trying to open is an mp4, not an avi file. If your bink converter cannot open mp4 files, you can either convert your file to .avi with a different tool and then convert it, or you can find a different bink conversion tool. I am not able to provide a recommendation other than to google "bink mp4 conversion". 

I have a convertible laptop/tablet with graphics tablet screen, which often logs out of the current X session whilst using GIMP 2.6. I am dropped back to the login prompt without a system wide restart. All unsaved work is lost, making this a real problem for me. This only seems to happen whilst reaching over the keyboard to draw on the screen. I have disabled the CTRLAltBackspace shortcut so I don't believe leaning on the keyboard is causing the problem. There is no output to dmesg or xsession-errors when the restart occurs. Any advice on how to track down or deal with this problem would be appreciated. OS: Linux mint 13, 64 bit (up to date) Hardware: unmodified HP Compaq 2710p, (laptop/wacom graphics tablet), no external devices connected. I have sought an answer at the XFCE forums but with no response after two weeks. 

The question that anyone who wants to answer your question has to ask themselves is: are there any features available in Internet Explorer 10 that are only available in Windows 8? Luckily for you, Microsoft has a pretty good list of differences on MSDN. The list mainly states that you'll lose 

I was trying to confirm your issue, but I have no problems changing the location of any of the folders within the user folder. 

The simple and "automated" way If you'd like to keep it simple, simply open upen an administrative session of PowerShell (if you need so), and run the following snippet. It'll do the steps above. 

Combined with AutoIT, AutoHotkey or a batch script, this PDF-document (Command Line Functions => Using DTCFG-Configuring the Desktop => DTCFG Desktop Configuration Commands) may be of great assistance. From that I tried to create a simple AutoHotkey-script, but I am not sure if it works, nor if it does what you want. 

Disabling SkyDrive entirely via registry editor This method should work regardless of Windows version. 

What you're doing here should work just fine - I myself have done it in the past and it usually works without hassle! However, if you're experiencing some issues it could be due to... 

1.a If they are both necessary, are there any benefits? The only "benefit" -- it's not really a benefit, as much as a requirement -- is that with SMB over NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP), you'll actually be able to communicate with a greater deal of implementations of SMB. 2. What information/service does and provide? *My quick guess is that while simply provides the NetBIOS API, including NBT (NetBIOS over TCP/IP) via port . On the other hand, provides the direct hosting of SMB via port .* 

Usage without trayicon: Just drag and drop your favourite application to gdi++.exe. Native Windows controls are also now in effect. Usage with trayicon: Just right-click the trayicon and select . 

To achieve this you can use GDI++, which is an application that renders the fonts on Windows applications with GDI instead of the typical ClearType. 

If you look under the section System Commands in the -page for , you'll see the various options that are system related. A brief list is as follows for different modes: 

Firstly, I'd like to make a note that only speculation can be done on the basis of the slightly vague question of yours. On the first hunch, such a problem would be attributed to the fact that an internal SD-card reader is just another device; to you, such a device may seem as an integrated part of the system, but only in the sense that it's a part of the casing/tower/notebook. The data link between the motherboard and the actual SD-card reader could be the culprit, but so could the SD-card reader itself be. This meaning that if the data link is slower than the data link between the USB-device, then you're going to get a slower performance. Other factors could depend on features such as write-cache, but such elements would usually be bypassed by benchmarking software. 

You should have little difficulty installing any of these provided that you buy the correct socket type, and you can handle the disassembly yourself. If your laptop is still under warranty you may wish to find an authorized service centre who could install the chip for you professionally, at added expense but leaving your warranty intact. 

This page recommends adding blank accellator shortcuts to ~/.config/Terminal/terminalrc'. I run XFCE 4.8 and could not find this file myself. However, in my terminal preferences (under Edit), there is a shortcut tab. Help = F1 is the last shortcut in the list. My terminal emulator version is 0.4.8. Hopefully one of these will be applicable to you. 

If your FTP station has a static IP address or is on the same local network, you could simply set your firewall rules on the rip station to only allow outgoing and incoming port 21 (assuming you are using a non encrypted FTP connection) to the IP address of the FTP server. This will probably be insufficient if you are trying to connect through the internet to a computer with a dynamic IP address, as used by most broadband connections. If it is on the local network it may help to assign the FTP station an IP address manually rather than by DHCP, to eliminate the chance of it changing when more computers are added to the network. 

I believe you could upgrade to an SSD drive with minimal difficulty. There is a small possibility that the drive would be blacklisted by the BIOS, which you may wish to research, but I beleive this is unlikely. The service manual indicates several SSD drives for this laptop though I believe that most 2.5 inch drives with a 7mm height should be fine. The manual also indicates that there are i7 variants of this laptop. The listed compatible parts are: 

This seems to be a recognized bug with CUPS 1.6.x itself. There is a discussion and workaround for Ubuntu here Hopefully this will be applicable to your situation or at least advance improve your chances of finding a solution. 

A solution from link Right click Desktop, go to Properties>Appearance Click "Advanced", choose "Icon" and change size to something other than it's current size. Press "OK" to confirm changes in all relevant dialogue windows. When the icons have changed, restore the size to its original value. This should force a redraw of all icons, clearing the old images. 

Your card is not mentioned specifically, but there is a compatibility table here. It seems different cards can work together in a crossfire setup, provided they are within the same hundred family. For instance any 69xx will work with any other 69xx, but not a 68xx card. Be sure to check that your card is crossfire capable before buying a second one. 

Change the keyboard layout. Without the correct one for your actual keyboard, you'll experience oddities. 

Save it as a as-you-want.ps1, make sure you've set your execution policy to Unrestricted (or sign the above and change it to AllSigned) and run! 

Move any other folders that are in the parent folder of your folder Fire up PowerShell, and navigate to the parent folder. Run 

You could use CloneZilla. Clone using disk files to an intermediary if you'd like, then clone from those disk files to your new SSD. I've done the same procedure myself when I only had a USB Mini cable. First I cloned the SSD to the external HDD, then replaced the SSD with the new one and cloned the contents back to the new drive. As long as your new drive has a higher capacity than the older SSD, this should be smooth sailing. 

Basically, all you need to do is copy the contents of your Dropbox folder to wherever you place your new Dropbox folder. If you do this before selecting the folder you're going to use, Dropbox will still spend some time, but it'll only be on the verification of the files that are already in the folder. 

You can also only remove it from the navigation pane in Explorer, but I thought you might want to completely disable it. 

You can install Chocolatey exactly where you would like, and to make that easier, there's even some information written up on the wiki for Chocolatey about that! 

With the specifications for your netbook, there's no reason why this shouldn't work just fine. Especially if you look at the minimum requirements for Windows 7. Clearly, you'll need to install the drivers for your netbook - but the differences between Starter and Enterprise lie not in the core department, and thus that shouldn't be a problem. I would note however that I highly doubt you havea volume license agreement, and thus installing Windows 7 Enterprise seems highly unlikely to be "legit". Just saying! 

I think you're doing it quite correctly, but it seems like the class isn't available on your computer. Which, isn't surprising, as it isn't available here either: 

Manual solution Have you considered setting up the two instances of your web-server software to simply start up at boot? I don't see why you shouldn't be able to make it automatic. How about a login hook?. 

Start Windows Powershell with Win + R, then enter . Run the following snippet with appropriate adjustments. 

Most likely the page there is referring to the maximum capacity of the memory controller on the motherboard. Thus, you will not be able to utilize any more than 4GB of memory. Should you however add more than 4GB of memory, your device will not be harmed, although you might not be able to use any of the memory.
