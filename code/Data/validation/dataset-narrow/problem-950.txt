I started a new job recently. My computer at the office has Office 2010 installed. However, I've also installed my personal license of Office 365, giving me "access" (har har) to the 2013 versions of the programs. I've done this on previous work computers because I strongly prefer OneNote and Excel 2013 to the previous versions. Anyway, Outlook 2010 has a "OneNote" button in the "Move" category of the Home tab. Clicking it, however, attempts to send a note to OneNote 2010 (which hasn't been set up). I'm trying to figure out how to modify this button, or add a new button altogether, that would instead trigger a note to be created in OneNote 2013. In short, how do you add a "Move to OneNote 2013" button in Outlook 2010? 

I have an old solaris system with terabytes of data on it. Recently we got a new server and I went along with the recommendation of a windows server "because it was easy to manage". Someone copied the data from the solaris box onto the new server. All the data is there but somehow we seem to have lost all the ownership and permissions. Now even administrator accounts can't actually access the data on the windows share. I've tried everything I can think of to copy the permissions and ownership across. I've tried cacls to add permissions for the Administrator and Domain Admins but I just get error messages. 

Recently I began transferring old messages from a work (Exchange) account to Gmail using the IMAP connector in Outlook. It had been going fine for a few days as I organized and then moved folders. Then, when I tried to drag over a large number of messages from the Inbox, I ran into this known Outlook bug, even though it had been working fine, previously. The updates to Outlook that are said to fix this problem have not worked for me. The crash message is as follows: 

I have a Windows 8.1 Pro system with C:\ only containing the OS and some software. I also have a drive F:\ where I keep all of my files. Today I did a reset of Windows to get back to a clean slate. One of the folders on F:\ is my Dropbox folder, so I've been going through help articles to make sure to simply point Dropbox to F:\Dropbox and letting it index those files in place, instead of redownloading ~300 GB. One user described a problem where, because the Owner of the files was left over from his previous Windows installation, Dropbox began making conflicted duplicates of everything. This led me to go check out who the Owner is on some of my files. Permissions, Ownership, UAC and ACLs have never been my strongsuit. Frankly, I don't know if my account was the Owner of all my files in the old system, and, if not, why not. I don't understand much about what determines who owns a file when it is created, downloaded, copied, whatever. Now that I'm looking at the Owner of a few of these files, I'm noticing a trend that most of the ones I've looked at are owned by an entity with a long string name that means nothing to me. S-1-5-21-blahblahblah. The blahs stand in place of a long set of numbers. My best guess is that this string somehow was used in place of any file my user was the Owner of in my previous installation. Should I be taking ownership of all of these? Is there any harm in simply taking ownership of the entire Dropbox folder and its contents before I set up syncing? 

I can't connect to my wifi anymore. It used to work, now it doesn't. I have a TP-Link Archer T9E wireless card. I can't really try to connect to other networks as it is not a laptop. The only thing I can do is setting my phone as hotspot, and this works. I've tried disable/reenabling the wireless card, forgetting the network, restarting the router, and reinstalling the card's driver. None of this worked. I've seen several people with similar problems, I've tried everything I could find, nothing worked. Is there a way to get a better diagnosis? Like why it can't connect to the network, at which phase it fails, or something? Thanks. 

I performed a reset on Windows 8.1. On a non-system drive where I keep data, most of the files have an SID related to my user account from the old installation. However, a good number of them have the owner set to Administrators. Ideally I would be able to take ownership of all the files with my old account's SID, and leave the Administrator files alone. However, I can't seem to find a way to selectively perform this action. So I believe my two choices are to take ownership of all the files as my current user account, or to assign ownership to Administrators for all the files. So, my question is multi-part: 

outputs lots of stuff but doesn't AFAICT change permissions and definitely doesn't change ownership. Now I'm sure the data as it grew over many years probably has stuffed permissions, stuffed unix permissions, but it was at least useable. Now with a much more complex set of permissions it's not even accessible. AFAIC this is a giant step backwards. 

On a linux/unix fileserver I can see the permissions of all the files in a directory with an "ls". On this system I need 10 minutes and half a dozen dialog boxes just to see the permissions. I've tried to copy the permissions and ownerships from the source directory mounted using NFS and samba with rsync and robocopy run by the Administrator. Nothing useful happened. Mounting the source directory with NFS I couldn't see owners names, just UIDs. Mounting them as CIFS shares I could see the owners. 

Almost 2 years ago I built a custom desktop. This week it seems to be becoming inoperable. It's a dual boot system capable of booting to Windows 7 or Windows 8.1. When I sat down at it the other night, I noticed Windows (8.1) complaining about broken links in my shortcuts. I soon discovered my F: drive (the main data drive) did not appear in "This PC." I thought maybe the drive failed, but I had some pending updates, so I rebooted. Rebooting took abnormally longer to happen. Programs that I personally set to launch at startup in the system tray never launched. I opened a File Explorer windows to view This PC and all the drives appeared, but the green progress bar indicating the loading of all the drives' info took many minutes to finish. The F: drive did appear, but the blue bar indicating how full it was never did. Interacting with the window put it into a (Not Responding) state. I wasn't able to open any files. Wondering if this was related to recent software changes, I powered down and booted into my Windows 7 drive instead. It got to the screen that allows me to select Windows 7 or 8, but once I selected 7, the screens went black and stayed that way. I was forced to do a hard shutdown. I tried Windows 8 one more time but had the same problems. So I shut it down and left it shutdown since. If my F: drive were the problem, I wouldn't think the OSes (each are on their own separate drives) would have such trouble. My question is, what parts should I suspect of failing? How can I diagnose this? My best guess is that a drive bus on the MoBo could be bad, causing some of the drives to have trouble communicating. I've never had such catastrophic failure before other than what was obviously HDD related. Could a bad RAM stick cause this? Could the CPU be failing? I can get specific part model identifiers if needed. I have a Gigabyte motherboard, an Intel i7 (one of the Haswell models) and four hard drives. There are 32 GB of that "Hyper Red" memory that Kingston makes. Each OS is on its own SSD drive made by Samsung in the neighborhood of 320 GB. The other two drives (F: and G:) are 3 TB SATA disks. One is my primary data drive and the other is its backup (I also use other backup methods). There are 32 GB of that "Hyper Red" memory that Kingston makes. I have a pretty decent NVIDIA graphics card made by PCN I believe. Corsair powersupply. Blu-Ray burner. 

I had a similar problem with a text file which had numbers in currency format. ($nn,nnn.nn) (UK/US/CA/AU et al. style) Libre office decided it was text and put a hidden quote in front of the numbers. Grrrr.. I had to remove the "$"s and the "," commas from the csv file and reimport. Then it all worked like a bought one. I might suggest changing your delimiter to something not a comma. I prefer tabs. You can't go wrong with tabs. Comma is problematical because it's a character used in numbers (but differently in different parts of the world). CSV was always a gigantic kludge. colon or semi colon might be OK. 

In Windows (7 or 8, in my case), snapping a Chrome window to the left or right half of the screen (by using Win + → or Win + ← or by dragging to the corresponding edges) results in the window taking up slightly more than half the screen. On the screen I'm using now (900px wide), it results in about 60 extra pixels (almost 7%). I've long found this supremely annoying because it often prevents properly using two windows snapped side by side, which is what the snapping feature is designed for. I'm wondering if it's known why this happens, and if there's some way to correct it (perhaps a flag or extension?). Update: It appears this only happens with a window having many tabs. The higher the tab count gets after first creating the problem, the worse the problem becomes (until it reaches a maximum). See the below screenshots. One might conclude the solution is to avoid having many tabs, but that is a lame solution. Is there no way to prevent this behavior for those that find it undesirable? Normal behavior: 

So I got a SSD and a standard HDD in my laptop. I put the SSD myself, instead of the CD thingy. It was working fine for a while, but now the computer sometimes freezes and I strongly suspect that the SSD moves a little and thus disconnects for a bit. Can I switch spots between it and the other disc without problems? I guess my question is, has the port in which it's plugged any influence on how windows recognises a drive? Thanks 

I have an Asus N550-JV laptop. I had added a SSD instead of the optical drive. Then the screen stopped working so I had to send it into reparation. Before doing so though I removed the SSD and put back the optical drive, this way I figured whatever they do I will be able to put my SSD back in and boot from there. It wasn't a bad idea as it looks like they restored my laptop to factory settings, with a clean Windows 8 installation. But after having reinstalled my SSD, it looks like I cannot boot on it. It looks like the UEFI doesn't consider it a bootable device. What can I do? 

There is no way to take ownership of just the files bearing a certain SID, right? If the answer to 1 is no, then what practical differences exist between taking ownership of all the files myself, or assigning ownership to Administrators? 

My problem, other than the continued crashing, is that I dragged the messages from the Exchange account, and so they no longer appear there, but only a small fraction of them made it into the Gmail account before the crashes started happening. Now it seems maybe they're in some sort of limbo where Outlook wants to sync them over to Gmail, but since it crashes so quickly after launch (while syncing), it is unable to do so. I'm wondering if there's any approach I can take that will call these messages back from limbo instead of just considering them lost. In , I can still see the and for the Exchange account, as well as the for the Gmail account. There are files in the RoamCache that begin with . Should I try backing up some assortment of all these files, and removing/reconnecting my IMAP Gmail connector? UPDATE I have gotten Outlook to stop crashing by setting up a new profile. However, the messages that were in the middle of transferring do not appear in either account, neither on the server (i.e. Outlook 365 web client/Gmail web client), nor in the Outlook desktop client. I'm assuming they're trapped somewhere in a data file on my machine and I'm wondering if there's any way to get the new profile to see that there are still a few hundred messages that should be uploaded to the IMAP/Gmail account.
