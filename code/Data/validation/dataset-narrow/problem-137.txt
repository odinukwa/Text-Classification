I need to set up the following on Several Nortel Baystack's (5530/5520): "Assign a priority to DXL VoIP traffic with a DSCP priority level which will be co-exist with the rest of the real-time traffic on your system. For most cases a priority level of “Expedited” (ef) can be used for VoIP traffic." If it's easier I can prioritize specific ports. We are using the java device manager for Nortel devices and have yet to successfully implement QOS. We have found various settings but not a way to apply it to an actual port or type of traffic. I am familiar with Cisco QOS but not Nortel. I have failed to find appropriate documentation and I can't call support (Nortel doesn't exist anymore). This would be taking place on a security network. Background information: We have intercoms on a Nortel network that are only working one-way, when they need to be both. On our cisco network the intercoms work both ways without issue (no QOS is configured on Cisco). Our support rep for the intercoms (Harding) suggests that we require QOS on the network. Since my coworkers and myself have hit a wall, we have come here for help. Thanks in advance. 

The question I am asking is how is this possible, what does code 9 mean? Can it be ignored or would it be worth investigating further? I read in a previous answer that when ICMP tunneling comes in to play the data included in an echo is arbitrary, can this carry over to the header? Thanks in advance! 

The reply can also be seen in the next hex dump. It is also strange because it is an ICMP echo reply with a code of 9. An ICMP echo can only have a code of 0. 

I have a Ruckus 7363 AP that is connected and managed through a Ruckus Zone Director. I have a total of 4 Access Points with 3/4 working fine. The one that is not working fine is in a geographically different location, but this should not be an issue. The network Infrastructure is as follows: Ruckus -> Cisco POE Switch -> Cisco Router I am using VLAN 204 for this configuration and have configured the router as both the DHCP server and the VLAN gateway (using SVI). The port on the switch was previously configured as an access port. I was able to plug in my laptop or the ruckus and both were provided DHCP addresses. When I tried to connect a wireless client to the Ruckus AP, it would be given an APIPA address. I have since changed the port on the switch to be a trunk port as per recommendations and I am still receiving the same results. I can confirm that the DHCP server on the switch is NOT receiving DHCP requests in this method but that it WAS receiving them when my laptop was plugged in to the port. This leads me to believe the issue is isolated to the Ruckus WAP. I am really at a loss as to what step to take next. I have scoured the Ruckus forums and found a few commands (such as disabling directed dhcp) that didn't work for me. I have tested connecting with Android, Blackberry and Windows clients with no success. I have also confirmed that the VLAN tag is the same through each step. I am simply trying to have DHCP work for clients that connect through the wireless access point and it is proving to be more difficult than anticipated. Thanks in advance. 

I am currently doing an assignment that requires us to generate ICMP packet with various types and codes. I have consulted the RFCs as well as various other place. Many of the types and codes I get make perfect sense; except for this one. I somehow generated a packet that had a type of 8 (echo request) and a code of 9. The problem is that type 8 ICMP can only have a single code of 0. See the packet below as a hex dump from wireshark: 

Athan, As other guys suggested, you would need to provide more information but you need to bear in mind that pinging and browsing are different.Also we don't know where you are pinging. Browsing first of all requires connectivity to the target node, do you have it? If yes, then drill down on other mechanisms. Does your DNS work? Can you resolve addresses? Did you try doing nslookup? You say some nodes can access while others can't. Is there a difference in their DNS configuration? Have you checked your devices' logs for any event that may give you a clue? So I ended up asking more questions then you unfortunately. 

I think you could either bridge your connections (NICs) at PC2 or write a static route on command line to get 2 networks talk to each oher. If your switch is manageable you could also write an ACL not to allow outbound connections towards PC1 network. Just thinking also, if you removed the default gateway from the nodes on your lower network tthey can stay isolates, am I wrong? Regards... 

Switches come in different flavours JavaDeveloper. Why do you need a switch? Because you want more than 2 hosts to share a common communication medium. If you have 2 PCs and they are not far away from each other you could connect an ethernet cable between them, assign IP addresses and start communicating. What if you have 15 PCs? Then you want to have a shared medium, a meeting ground where all are available. Let's carry on with the same analogy. You plugged in your switch, did the cabling, employed an IP distribution mechanism and assigned each a 192.168.1.x/24 address. You will see that they can reach other. You can create a shared folder on one and send/receive files from others, you are connected. Now imagine you wanted you and your neighbours' PCs to communicate, he uses a different subnet plus you don't have enough ethernet ports. You now need another mechanism that will route the traffic between you two. You found a router with two interfaces and connected a cable from your switch to one interface and another cable from your neighbours's switch to the oher interface. Why did you plug this cable to switches but not a printer? Because everybody is there and available. If you see the world from the router's point of view, I have 2 networks on each side, one speaks German, other one speaks French. In order to be able to let you 2 communicate it has to speak both languages. That's why on each router interface, you assign an IP address from each subnet to the correct side (yours will be 192.168.1.x/24). He is your virtual gate to your neighbour's house. If your network needs to communicate your neighbours, you have to knock on the virtual door. The address you just assigned at the router interface is your network's gateway to the other network which makes sense right? If you have a PC that only communicates with your printer, you don't need to assign him a gateway address why should you? He always stays at home. When does a switch talk to router? When it needs to contact other adjacent or reachable networks. (as other people wrote down, there are layer 3 switches thatt can be assigned IP addresses from other networks enabling you to meet everybody there but I won't talk about that. I wrote long, please don't get me wrong, there are other people who can make use of this thread) Hope this helps. 

When it comes to ISP redundancy, if your circumstantes allow it i.e. you own a Public IP address or subnet; you could use BGP protocol which would connect you to internet with more than one ISP. They would both point your network from internet ad you could assign priority. That's a method. Secondly you could have a load balancer like a Peplink device.You have multiple WAN ports on load balancers and can establish clever and flexible algorithms on it. You don't have to use such a device to use 1 active connection. In theory you could have 3 ISPs at the same time and divide your traffic on the way to the internet based on your source addresses, destination addresses and protocols for example. Thirdly, you could use things like IP SLA commands to costantly check if one ISP available, as soon as it goes down the traffic could be diverted to second ISP. In order to do this you should have L3 devices that can support these capabilities. Hope this helps. 

As far as I am concerned, the most common SFP problems are Poor performance, No connectivity and Corrupted software. For the first one, the possible cause of this problem include that cabling distance is exceeded or port statistics show excessive frame check sequence (FCS), late-collision, or alignment errors. Resolution: Reduce the cable length to within the recommended distances. See your SFP module documentation for cabling guidelines. For the comnectivity issue, maybe you have used the incorrect ot bad cable, or STP (Shielded Twisted Pair) checking for possible loops. Resolution: Verify the pinouts are correct for the proper application of cables. Replace the cable with a tested good cable. Wait 30 seconds for the port LED to turn green. For the third issue—corrupted software, this include three situation including the port is placed in error-disabled state after SFP is inserted, device does not recognize the SFP module, and excessive errors found in port statistics. Resolution: Remove the SFP module from the switch and replace it with a Cisco-approved module. Use the irrdisable recovery cause GBIC-invalid global configuration command to verify the port status, and enter a time interval to recover from the error-disable state. The best advice is to use the Cisco original SFP or 100% Cisco compatible SFP (If you decide to use a third-party SFP, please ensure that your supplier is assured) that is adapted to the switch. Hope this might help you! 

According to my own experience, it is a laughably misleading opinion. In fact, it will hurt the latency since the longer distance, but not bandwidth. Supposing you are comparing the internet speed of using the 10m fiber and 20m fiber, you will find that electrical signals travel through an ethernet cable at the speed of light, or 299,792,458 meters per second. That means that it takes about 0.00000003 seconds for the signal to travel through your 10m cable, and 0.00000006 seconds to travel through your 20m cable. You cannot notice the difference here. Not mention if you compare to many miles to whatever server you are accessing. However, longer distance transmission indeed have signal loss and noise issue, which might have an impact on the internet speed. 

Since you have so many questions, I will explain the first one in details. Basically, you should understand that routers have two main functions: Forwarding pkt to destination (IP address) Running routing protocol A router refers to a device that generally performs its operations by software. While the main role of a switch is to transfer packet as fast as possible based on IP address, especially for the layer 3 switch. A Layer 3 switch, does it per hardware. It's usually and depending on the environment that you are. There are carrier grade routers that route packets using hardware. But, routers provides features that are considered 'premium' in switches such as NAT, Firewall, BGP, VPN, MPLS, VPLS,... These things are really difficult to implement in hardware and that's why the carrier grade routers that implement these protocols are so expensive. To sum up, the case of use of a Switch and a router are different, although they are the same at a theoretical point of view. 

Can one fiber be used to transmit and receive signals? Yes, one fiber can be used to transmit and receive signals. Have you heard of the WDM technology? This technology can multiplexe a number of optical carrier signals onto a single optical fiber by using different wavelengths of laser light. There are two common types of the WDM technology—CWDM and DWDM. Let's take CWDM as an example, a typical 8-channel CWDM system offers 8 times the amount of bandwidth that can be achieved using a SONET/SDH system, for a given transmission line speed and using the same optical fibers. For more, please have a look at this blog. For you own network, you can use the CWDM/DWDM optical transceivers, or BiDi transceiver.
