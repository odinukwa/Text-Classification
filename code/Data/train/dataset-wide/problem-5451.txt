Not that any member of the set that never transitions from not yet existing to existing is not a part of everything, a contradiction, and there was once (presumably) nothing, so all members of everything experience at least one state transition. Ah hah, no we're getting into the subtleties of grammar. Is the Statue of Zeus a concept? In which case, the concept still exists. Is the Statue of Zeus an arrangement of matter? If so, no matter still exists in that arrangement, but the actual nature of the arrangement still exists as a possibility. Is the Statue of Zeus a specific incidence of an arrangement of matter? If so, then that specific incidence has experienced in second transition into formerly existing. So let's take members of the set of everything to also have the following attributes: an arrangement (for concepts we can use bit-modeled neural arrangements) and an incidence. So every member of the set of everything has a state, an arrangement, and an incidence. Take anything to be a member of the set of everything that is either in the state of not yet existing or formerly existing. Then anything does not exist but is still anything because it exists at another point in time. Similarly, the corollary for space would bundle a location with a member, so that if the Statue of Zeus at Olympia were moved to say, Missoula, then the Statue of Zeus at Olympia would no longer exist and therefore not exist, even though a member of everything with the same arrangement, incidence, and state would still exist. Alternatively, incidence could be tied to location. 

I think using the term belief hides the fact that we could have an intuition of the world. Even if Kant's synthetic a priori judgements are questionned by modern formal logic, his idea remains very interesting. So rather than belief if we use the term intution we can consider that we do not formulate hypothesis about the world at random but we rather have an a priori knowledge of it. Accepting this point of view, more general than synthetic a priori judgement, the assumptions we use to build mathematics are guided by the intution of the world we have, they are the tool we use to force the Nature to answer our questions, as Kant used to say. We could see in dissipative systems, Goedel incompletude theorem or general relativity the evidence of our world intuition and the inherent limit of formal logic or determinism : neither our mind nor the world we have the intuition of are bounded by theories, we are not sophisticated random access memory machines eventually reduced to determinism and formal logic. Otherwise there is a sounder and very well structured article in Standford Encycopedia of Phyiosophy on synthetic and analytic judgement 

Consciousness: the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings. (Thanks Google!) Well from a grammatical perspective we're certainly safe. I would hold the burden of evidence to be on the counter-argument in this case. I know of no non-egocentric reason to assume that thoughts and feelings are a pre-requisite for consciousness, or even that the human mind is a pre-requistite for thoughts or feelings. 

I think so. For example, one could start with faulty assumptions then rationalize one. Or, given the number of conspiracy theories, it's always possible one is true but not held as truth due to incomplete information. Let's attempt an argument, just for consideration of conspiracy theory in general. ================================================================================== There are a large number of conspiracy theories. Already demonstrated. Moreover, the public has access to imperfect information. For example, we know of the existence of certain top secret and classified programs. Likewise, there is some uncertainty regarding a few historical claims. Perhaps it is possible that, given the number of theories and existence of imperfect information, perfect information would shed greater light on an given one of the many conspiracy theories. That sounds somewhat reasonable I hope. Moreover, we know that some things we'd rather wish to be conspiracy theories actually aren't, like the CIA deposing of legitimate regimes throughout the developing world during the Cold War. Also, we know that, in the absence of clear evidence, people will tend to believe what the want to believe. For that reason, unpopular opinion shouldn't be categorically ignored. Wait! Maybe something that we don't know for sure the CIA did they actually did! Then we get to the fun part. Certain truths taken as given, such as the legitimacy of our governments, when called into question, even in the slightest, have broad ramifications for interpretation of other information. Maybe that's why they want Snowden! Maybe that's why the Supreme Court rigged the 2000 Presidential election! Maybe that's why the Federal Reserve is... I don't even know. Something. I bet the cartels are all backed the Bush family! They must be part of the Illuminati and the Knights Templar. Which means the whole GOP back to Lincoln must be too. He was probably a vampire hunter! That explains how that movie got released! (Hope that wasn't too harsh) Oh my gosh it's turtles all the way down! I suppose that isn't an entirely unreasonable argument. I'm guess with enough research and enough bias you could fairly well satisfy the requirements for rationality of any one of the conspiracy theories, but I'd rather not lend any weight to them (in most cases even if they are true) so I'm not going to do that here. ================================================================================== Side note: 

From a different perspective one can say darkness is the absence of light and is not a being. So there are things which exist without being, it's another way to see borderline existence. This consideration is deeper than it appears as in a christian tradition the evil exists but just as an absence of good, the evil exists without being. 

I believe Heidegger set the foundations of existentialism in his attempt to renew the occidental metaphysic by analyzing the existence of the man, he calls dasein by opposition to the Being in his seminal work “Being end time”. The dasein has an unformulated worry, he is cast in the world and abandoned by the Being, he exists by opposition to the Being which is. In German and French there are two words for being, the fact to be and the Being. The ontology of the dasein, the analysis of its existence is certainly the foundation of existentialism even if Heidegger did not recognized himself as an existentialist. The dereliction of the man is at the root of this philosophical movement. 

I would argue that there is an implicit trade-off between bias and decisiveness, similar to trade-offs between accuracy and precision. I take the following to be an unbiased statement. 

Good morning is an extension of your best wishes - a method of voicing support. Supporting your teacher should enable that teacher to teach better, unless that teacher is functioning under non-standard social protocols, and enable that teacher to better provide instruction. 

It is most likely in your own best interest to respect teachers so that you don't put them on edge and learn less than you could've from them. So I think it's in your best interest, yes, which I suppose is a type of justification. If you considerable evidence to believe you aren't going to learn something from a teacher or would become less educated under a teacher, then respect would be less necessary as a teacher, but I believe you should still respect that teacher as a person if nothing else. 

I believe truth is the mother of all logical systems. Even undecidability is based on truth, propositions we prove we cannot demonstrate they are true or false, which are new potential axioms in fact as the axiom of choice which seems so obvious : it is always possible to select exactly one element of each set of a collection of sets. In fact we always instinctively try to prove that something is true or false, right or wrong and this is true for mathematics. At the beginning people did not want to prove things which seemed obvious, there were true as euclidian axioms were. It is a relatively new idea to consider the proof as central, it's maybe the main difference between modern mathematics and physics, in physics what really matters is truth, what can be tested. Truth is deeply rooted in our culture, much more than provability. 

Sorry for my English, I'm French. I believe each time we are looking for a proof, we refer to reason. Kant has well defined the boundaries of the realm on rationalism, and it's demonstration of the impossibility to proove the existence of God is also applicable to its non-existence, so I do not see any possibility to give a rigorous philosophical basis to atheism. 

Oh no, you asked an extension question about taking a position. Well that makes this harder. I would argue that being sufficiently informed to produce a position on any issue will necessarily introduce non-zero bias. However, we may be able to further refine our answers. For example, perhaps we can eliminate one of the above cases with the following definition: 

I believe it is not unreasonable to subsume justice into kindness and, under game theory, charge kindness as a mandate subject to relativity under rule 5. Moreover, as kindness can be held to be consideration for the happiness of self and others, I subsume these 5 rules into these 3: 

Those seemed to be the most common and applicable terms when I was reading Marx. EDIT: Thanks Google! 

Now, should the added definition be considered as a bias? Perhaps, perhaps a clarification, perhaps it is meaningless. These are open questions. However, to me this suggests it is possible to refine statements beyond no position, to some position, to a certain extent, without introduction bias. I would argue that this continues only up to a certain point. To me, religion is beyond that point, but I do believe it may be possible to get down to a single a religion. I'm tempted to say only time will tell, but I'm worried that may carry with it my internal bias for optimism and progress.
