Let $\alpha: [a,b]\to M$ be an embedded curve in a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ and let $p$ be a point in $M$, not on the curve $\alpha$. If $p$ is close enough to $\alpha$, there exists a unique geodesic $\gamma$ of $M$, parametrised proportional to arc length and satisfying $\gamma(0)= \alpha(s)$ for some $s \in [a,b]$, $g(\gamma'(0), \alpha'(s))= 0$ and $p = \gamma(1)$. The image of $p$ under the reflection with respect to $\alpha$ is the point $q = \gamma(-1)$. The $q$ said to be local reflection of $p$. Now, if we take a non-zero vector field $X$ and use the above algorithm for integral curve of $X$ and suppose local reflection is a isometry, then what we can say about:

Obviously $s\leq \Delta$. Is the following clime true? Could someone provide a counterexample or a sketch of proof for this clime? 

Apart from known example of Prof. Bryant, the authors of the above paper have not provided any references for bolded examples. Does anyone know where can I find this examples? 

This question comes from the study of conformally flat almost Hermitian manifolds. Your suggestions will be appreciated. 

This YouTube video is the intuition behind the Ricci flow in 1-dimensional and discussed by James Isenberg from the University of Oregon. 

I think that in preceding theorem $\chi(d_1 ,c)$ would be undefined (if $c> d_1$). Not? So if this be correct, in theorem 6 same paper the author used the above theorem for $d_1=d-c-1$ and $d_2=c$, then 

Update. Remark: Note that if $s=\Delta$ and without repetitive color then the problem reduces to usual edge coloring. this is useful for understanding this problem. 

I think the relativisation is completely straightforward (but Dave Marker's comment is correct). One can piece together the arguments (as in Steve Simpson's book) and just add the parameter $Y$ at all stages. 

Edit added to address Gro-Tsen's queries (see comment below) and intended to complete both the original Question and its second reformulation: (A) The function $F(\delta)=L_\delta$ is p.r. (See Devlin, "Constructibility" but I think it is in [1] anyway.) Satisfaction is likewise p.r., hence the function: $G(\delta)=1$ if $L_\delta \vDash $ '' $A\wedge \forall\delta' L_{\delta'} \vDash \neg A$''; $G(\delta)=0$ otherwise is p.r. and gives that the least $\delta$ with $L_\delta\vDash A$ is p.r. recognizable. (B) Let $\beta<\sigma_1$ . We want that $\beta$ is p.r. recognizable*. Let $A$ be a $\Sigma_1$ sentence that is first true at some $\gamma \in (\beta, \sigma_1)$. By standard arguments the $<_L$-least bijection $f_\gamma:\omega\leftrightarrow \gamma$ is definable over $L_\gamma$. Suppose $f_\gamma(n)=\beta$. By the kind of argument in (A) we see that $ \gamma$ is p.r. recog*. But then so is $L_{\gamma+1}$ and $f_\gamma$. Put these facts together to build a p.r. function $G$ whose only non-zero value is $G(\gamma)=\beta$. (C) We answer this (and, using the first Lemma above, finish the original Question) by: Lemma Let $\alpha < \beta_0$. Then $\alpha$ is p.r. recog. Hence the least p.r. reflecting ordinal is $\beta_0$ which in turn is the least non-p.r. recog. ordinal. Proof: Say that $\alpha$ begins a gap if $\exists \delta ( L_\alpha \prec_{\Sigma_1} L_\delta)$. We say that $[\alpha,\delta]$ is a gap, if $\alpha$ begins a gap, and $\delta$ is maximal with $L_\alpha \prec_{\Sigma_1} L_\delta$. $\bullet$ If $\omega < \delta < \beta_0$ is not in any gap, then we are sufficiently low down in the $L$-hierarchy where there is a $\Sigma_1$ sentence $A=A(\delta)$ so that $L_{\delta+1}\vDash $ ``$A\wedge\forall \delta’<\delta L_{\delta’ + 1}\vDash \neg A$ ‘’. As argued above at (A), this makes $\delta+1$ and so $\delta$ p.r. recog. We just need the ordinals of gaps $[\alpha,\delta]$ with $\alpha <\beta_0$ to be p.r. recognizable. So let $[\alpha,\delta]$ be such a gap. We show that $\alpha$ is p.r. recog. and variants of the argument suffice for the other ordinals in the gap. Then $\alpha < \delta < \alpha^* <\beta_0$. Using (un)/pairing functions (which are p.r.) etc. one has that the closure of $\{\alpha\}$ under p.r. functions includes all ordinals up to $\alpha^*$. So let $F$ be a p.r. function, with $F(\alpha)=\delta’$ for some $\delta’\in (\delta,\alpha^*)$. Let $A=A(\delta’)$. Let: $G(\xi) = 1$ if $L_{F(\xi)+1}\vDash A$; $G(\xi) = 0$ otherwise. Then $G$ witnesses that $\alpha$ is p.r. recognizable, so we are done. Q.E.D. (The definition of $\beta_0$ and $\beta$ is that given in Gro-Tsen's second formulation of question, in terms of the Veblen function (if I understand the terms correctly).) 

According to Wikipedia (last edited on 31 March 2017, at 03:48.) the Hadamard conjecture is open still. 

Q2: As you know Einstein metrics are fixed points of normalized ricci flow equation. Is there a PDE such as normalized ricci flow for $\alpha-$Einstein metrics? Thanks. 

Harmonic vector fields are critical points of Dirichlet energy function on the set of all unit vector fields on $M$, which is defined as follows: $$E(X):=\frac{1}{2}\int_M\|dX\|^2\mathrm{dVol_g}\qquad X: (M,g)\to (TM,g_s), \|X\|=1.$$ Where it's Euler-Lagrange equation satisfies the following: $$\bar{\Delta}X=\lambda X,\quad \lambda\in C^\infty(M)$$ where $\bar{\Delta}$ denote rough Laplacian. $p$-Harmonic vector field: If we use $p$-energy function instead of Dirichlet energy function: $$E_p(X):=\frac{1}{p}\int_M\|\mathrm{d}X\|^p\mathrm{dVol_g},\qquad X: (M,g)\to (TM,g_s),$$ The Euler-Lagrange equation of $E_p(.)$ in all vector fields (not in unit case) is as follows (for function case see this paper): $$\|dX\|^{p-2}\left(\tau(X) + dX\left(\mathrm{grad}(\log \|dX\|^{p-2})\right)\right) =0.$$ where $\tau(X)=\mathrm{div}(dX)$ called tension field of $X$. My questions are : Question 1: What is the Euler-Lagrange of $E_p(.)$ on the set of all unit vector fields on $M$? Question 2: Did one can hope to get statements which is generalized and new (not same to exactly) 2-harmonic (harmonic vector field) case? Thanks. 

In some Papers Take $p \in M$ and denote by $f$ the local reflection with respect to the integral curve of $X$ through $p$. Then $f(p) = p$,$f_∗X_p = X_p$ and $f_∗Y_p = -Y_p$ for $Y\in X_p^\perp$ . Since $f$ is a local isometry, it preserves the Riemann curvature tensor. In particular, for $Y_1 ,Y_2 ,Y_3 ∈ T_p M$, it holds $$f_∗R_p (Y_1 ,Y_2 )Y_3 = R_p (f_∗ Y_ 1 ,f_∗Y_2 )f_∗ Y_3,$$ So, if $Y_1 ,Y_2 ,Y_3$ are orthogonal to $X$, we have $$f_∗R_p (Y_1 ,Y_2 )Y_3 = -R_p (Y_ 1 ,Y_2 )Y_3.$$ In this way, we see that, for $Y,Z,W$ orthogonal to $X$ it holds $$R(Y,Z )W \perp X,\ R(Y,Z )X = 0,\ R(Y,X)Z\sim X,\ R(Y,X)X ⊥ X. $$ Update: I found in some paper the following criterion for a reflection with respect to a curve to be locally isometric: 

A Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ is called $\alpha-$Einstein if there exist a non-zero $1-$form $\alpha$ such $$\rho=ag+b\alpha\otimes\alpha$$ where $a,b$ are smooth functions on $M$ and $\rho$ is ricci tensor of $g$. It is easy to see that if $b=0$ then $(M,g)$ reduce to Einstein manifold. Q1: Is there a similar version of the following known theorem such that we deduce $(M,g)$ is a $\alpha-$Einstein: 

Consider the case $2^\omega$ (the case of Baire space I believe is only notationally more complicated.) Let $(s_i : i<\omega)$ recursively enumerate $2^{<\omega}$ with $s_0=\varnothing$ and $s_i \subset s_j $ $\rightarrow$ $i < j$ Let $l_i=length(s_i)$. Given a nice function $f$ as witnessed by $g_f$ call $s_i$ a "switch" if $g_f(s_i\upharpoonright l_i - 1) \neq g_f(s_i)$. For switches $s_i,s_j, j\neq i$ only define $s_i \prec s_j$ if $s_i \supset s_j$. By the properties of $f,g_f$, $\prec$ has no infinite descending paths, hence it is a finite path tree $T_{g_f}$, with a rank function $rk_T$ say. Let $r(g_f)$ be the rank of this tree. Then $r(g_f) < \omega_1^{g_f}$ where the latter ordinal is the least not recursive in (the real code of) $g_f$. Consequently we can now define an $h$ function of the desired kind into $r(g_f)+1 \times 2$ as long as $h(s) \geq sup [ rk_T(s_i) : s \subset s_i ] +1$ for any $s\in 2^{<\omega}$. This shows any nice function is an $\alpha$-nice function for some $h$, and thus answers 1. Conversely given any finite path tree one can embed it into $2^{<\omega}$ in an order preserving way, via $G$ say, and define a function $f,g_f$ using the range of $G$ as "switches". As any countable ordinal is realised as the rank of such a finite path tree we see that the l.u.b for Q2 is $\omega_1$. 

(As the absentee supervisor am I allowed to pitch in?) To my mind this is least confusing if we take $A$ to be $B\cap C$ the intersection of a lightface open with a lightface closed set in the full Baire space. Here then the `game tree' for our purposes can be defined to be the set of finite partial plays in $\omega^{<\omega}$ up to some finite round. (Martin for example defines game trees which may have finite maximal branches, but let us ignore that here, and we'll only allow trees where every node can be extended.) Then the tree $T = \omega^{<\omega }\in L_{\omega_1^{ck}}$. (Similar considerations hold for trees which are subspaces of other spaces $X^\omega$ for countable $X$, and 'double-admissible' sets containing $X$ as an element, which we shall ignore.) (If the two sets are not lightface but are say open or closed in some real parameter $z$, then the tree may be in $L_{\omega_1^{ck}}$, but as Andreas points out the game (that is the payoff set $A$) may only be defined in $L_{\omega_1^{z ck}}[z]$. But let us continue to assume the param. $z=\emptyset$.) Now a winning strategy for the (lightface) open game $B$ on this `game-tree' is definable over (but is not necessarily a member of) $L_{\omega_1^{ck}}$ (and similarly for the closed game with payoff $C$). For $s \in \omega^{<\omega}$ let $N_s$ be the open neighbourhood of $s$: the set of all those $\omega$-sequences extending $s$. Suppose player I has no w.s for the game playing into $A$. Let $z$ be : $$\{ s \mid s \mbox{ is a finite even length seq. with } N_s\subseteq B\wedge \mbox{ I has a w.s in the game with starting position } s \mbox{ and playing into } C \}$$ This is a $\Sigma^1_1$ set and thus $z\in L_{\omega_2^{ck}}$ (but not necessarily $ L_{\omega_1^{ck}}$). The set, $D$, of $\omega$-sequences extending elements of $z$ is thus an open set in the param. $z$. By the usual argument for $\Sigma^0_1(z)$-Det. either I or II has a w.s to play into, or out of, $D$; moreover this strategy can be taken to be either in (in the case of I winning), or $\Pi_1$-definable over (in case of II), the next admissible set containing $z$: here $L_{\omega_2^{ck}}$. Now argue that I cannot have the w.strat. in this latter game (since we assumed I had no w.s. for $G_A$). Hence II has the w.s. here. Call it $\tau$. Let $$y = \{ s \mid s \mbox{ is a finite even length seq. with } N_s\subseteq B\wedge s \notin z \} .$$ For each $s\in y$ let $\tau(y)$ be the $L$-least w.s for II witnessing that $s\notin z$ (using $\Sigma^0_1$-Det.) We may assume the function $ s \rightarrow \tau(s)$ with domain $y$ is $\Sigma_1(L_{\omega_2^{ck}})$ (an essential use of $\Sigma_1$-Rep. here.) Now define a strategy $\tau^*$ by setting $\tau^*(s) =\tau(s)$ if $N_s\not\subseteq B$ and $\tau^*(s\smallfrown r) = \tau(s)(r)$ where $N_s \subseteq B$ (and $s$ is the shortest init. set. of $s \smallfrown r$ for which the latter is true). Now argue that $\tau^*$ is a w.s. for II in $G_A$. This shows that Det$(\Sigma^0_1 \cap \Pi^0_1)$ holds definably over (rather than strictly within) the second admissible set over the tree.) Lastly we point out that strategies for such games cannot all be elements of $L_{\omega_2^{ck}}$ - or in other words of $HYP(\mathcal{O})$: the complete $\Game(\Sigma^0_1 \cap \Pi^0_1)$ set of integers will be $\Pi_1(L_{\omega_2^{ck}})$.
