A question in study of subconvexity topic puzzles me for a long time, which mabe a stupid question for many experts. I really wish someone to help me out, and any advice will be highly appreciated. Let g a Hecke-Maass form for SL3(Z) which do not come from a symmetric square lift, and f be a Hecke-Maass cusp form for SL2(Z) of level $q$. The Rankin-Selberg L-function is defined by $$L( s,g\times f)=\sum_{m,n\ge 1}\frac{A(m,n)a(n)}{(m^2n)^s}.$$ My question is 

Let $f$ be a holomorphic or Maass cusp form for $SL(2,Z)$. Define $L(s,f)=\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{a_f(n)}{n^s}$, for $\Im s$ sufficiently large. Then $$L(-1+it,f)\ll_f \log^c q(f)t$$ holds, for some conatant $c$ ? Where $q(f)$ is the analytic conductor, $|t|>2$. We ever see the bound like $L(1/2,f)$, i want to know the corresponding bound for $L(s+it)$ with $\Re s<0$. I search the H. Iwaniec and E. Kowalski's book, it seems there are no records. Please, if some references talk about it, show me their names. 

Recall that a category C is small if the class of its morphisms is a set; otherwise, it is large. One of many examples of a large category is Set, for Russell's paradox reasons. A category C is locally small if the class of morphisms between any two of its objects is a set. Of course, a small category is necessarily locally small. The converse is not true, as Set is a counterexample. Now, I can construct categories that are not locally small. However, what's the most common or most reasonable such category? 

I don't know if this deserves to be an answer or a comment, as it includes information you surely know. The terminology of matroid theory borrows heavily from graph theory, linear algebra, and other fields. A dependent set in a graphic matroid corresponds to a cycle in the underlying graph, so a general dependent set in a matroid is called a circuit. The length of the smallest cycle of a graph is its girth, so the same word is used for a general matroid. As you're well aware, the spark of a matrix is the girth of its corresponding vector matroid. You're correct that your notion appear to be dual to spark. The appropriate terminology here could have been "cutset", as that's the corresponding notion in a (connected) graph, but for consistency it's cogirth. The co-spark of a matrix is the cogirth of its corresponding vector matroid. A matroid is representable (ie, as a vector matroid) over a field if and only if its dual matroid is representable. Moreover, the transformation taking a representation of a vector matroid to a representation of its dual matroid is completely effective. It follows, in a sense, that studying the co-spark of a matrix is equivalent to studying the spark of another matrix. In particular, any computational hardness results for spark carry over to co-spark. It seems, then, that the notion of co-spark would be useful primary as terminology and as a way of getting a handle on things, but not actually for new ideas. Here's one paper that has explicitly looked into these sorts of things: On the (co)girth of a connected matroid. 

Let $A$ be a finite set in $\mathbb{R}^2$ of $k^2$ elements and consider a set $B=\{x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\}$ such that the points in $B$ are in general position (no three points on a line). Question 1: Is it true that $|A+B|\geq (k+1)^2$? Question 2: Is it true that $|\cap_{i}(A+x_i)|\leq (k-1)^2$? Question 3: If either of 1-2 are true, is it the case that one of the extremal sets $A$ is a discrete square? 

Let $A\subset \mathbb{R^2}$ be a finite set such that $|A|=k^2$. Let $x_i\in \mathbb{R^2}$, $i=1,2,3,4$, be four points in the plane in general position (no three lie on any line). Let us form the multiset of cardinality $4k^2$ out of the four translates $A+x_i$ and call it $M$. Question: Can we partition $M$ into four sets (not multisets) $A_i$, $i=1,2,3,4$ with cardinalities $(k+1)^2$, $(k-1)(k+3)$, $(k-1)^2$, $(k-1)^2$, respectively? Question: Are there any good references for problems of this kind? 

For semiprimes, computing the Euler totient function is equivalent to factoring. Indeed, if n = pq for distinct primes p and q, then φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = pq - (p+q) + 1 = (n+1) - (p+q). Therefore, if you can compute φ(n), then you can compute p+q. However, it's then easy to solve for p and q because you know their sum and product (it's just a quadratic equation). If you believe factoring is hard for semi-primes, then so is computing the Euler totient function. Update! Factoring and computing the Euler totient function are known to be equivalent for arbitrary numbers, not just semiprimes. One reference is "Riemann's hypothesis and tests for primality" by Gary L. Miller. There, the equivalence is deterministic, but assumes a version of the Riemann hypothesis. See also section 10.4 of "A computational introduction to number theory and algebra" by Victor Shoup for a proof of probabilistic equivalence. 

Let us say have a sequence of $n$ 2-$D$ random variables $X_i=(\varepsilon_i/\sqrt{n},i\varepsilon_{i}\sqrt{6}/n^{3/2})$, where $\varepsilon_{i}$ are independent random variables such that $\mathbb{P}(\varepsilon_i =\pm 1)=1/2$. Denote by $S_n$ their sum and take a $2$-dimensional Gaussian random variable $Z$ with the same covariance matrix as $S_n$. Any standard Berry-Esseen theorem (say by Gotze or Bhachattarya or Bentkus) gives us that for any convex set $C$ we have \begin{equation} |\mathbb{P}(S_n\in C)-\mathbb{P}(Z\in C)|\leq c\gamma, \end{equation} where gamma is the sum of third absolute moments of $X_i$, which in this case behaves like $n^{-1/2}$. Question: is there a standard way to pass from the distance between distribution functions to expectations of Lipschitz functions? That is, suppose $f$ is Lipschitz, can we still bound \begin{equation} |\mathbb{E}f(S_n)-\mathbb{E}f(Z)| \end{equation} in therms of $\gamma$? If so, does the same bound of magnitude $\gamma$ still apply? 

Let $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ be independent random variables in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $EX_i=0$ and $||X_i||_{2}\leq 1$. What is the best known exponential upper bound for $$P(||X_1+\cdots+X_n||_{2}>x)?$$ In particular, is it true, that the one dimensional case (Hoeffding's inequality) is the best? That is, is the latter probability at most $C_d\exp(-\frac{x^2}{2n})$? (the conctand $C=C_d$ is needed to account for the effects of the norm for $x$ small, that is, for $x<\sqrt{d}$ we can take all variables taking values $e_i$ and $-e_i$ with probability $1/2$, where $e_i$ stand for the usual basis of $\mathbb{R}^d$.
