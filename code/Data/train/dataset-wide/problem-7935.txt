It is well known that the function $f(x) = e^{-x^2}$ has no elementary anti-derivative. The proof I know goes as follows: Let $F = \mathbb{C}(X)$. Let $F \subseteq E$ be the Picard-Vessiot extension for a suitable homogeneous differential equation for which $f$ is a solution. Then one may calculate $G(E/F)$ and show it is connected and not abelian. On the other hand, a calculation shows that if $K$ is a differential field extension of $F$ generated by elementary functions then the connected component of $G(K/F)$ is abelian, so it is impossible for an anti-derivative of $f$ to be contained in such a field $K$. However, in classical Galois theory we can do much better, there, we know that a polynomial equation is solvable by radicals if and only if the corresponding Galois group is solvable. So to my question - is an analog of this is available in differential Galois theory? Is there a general method to determine by properties of $G(F/E)$ if $F$ is contained in a field of elementary functions? 

Let $T(z)$ be a meromorphic square matrix function, that is - a matrix whose entries are complex meromorphic function of one variable. Recall that such a $T$ is said to have a right pole of order $r$ at direction $v$ at the point $z_0$ if $v(z)$ is a vector valued function holomorphic near $z_0$, such that $v(z_0) \ne 0$ and such that the vector valued function $T(z)v(z)$ has a pole of order $r$ at $z_0$. It is well known that if such a $T$ is holomorphic at infinity, then it may be represented by an equation of the form $T(z) = D+C(zI-A)^{-1}B$ Furthermore, assuming $A$ is of size $n$ and $T$ has $n$ poles (i.e, $T$ has a maximal McMillan degree - a representation with $n$ small as possible) then this representation is unique up to similarity: any other matrices $A',B',C',D'$ which represents $T$ are of the form $D'=D$, $A' = N^{-1}AN$, $B'=N^{-1}B$, $C'=CN$, where $N$ is some invertible matrix My question: Suppose we are given two meromorphic matrix functions $T_1(z) = D+C(zI-A)^{-1}B$ and $T_2 = D'+C'(zI-A')^{-1}B'$. Suppose both of these are of maximal McMillan degree, $A$ and $A'$ are of the same size, and supopse they share the same pole data. Does it follows that there exists an invertible matrix $N$ such that $A'=N^{-1}AN$ and $B'=N^{-1}B$? Thanks! 

Fix a prime $p$, and let $M$ be the unique nonabelian group of order $p^3$ and exponent $p$. Let us denote by $E_n$ the elementary abelian group of rank $n$. Is it true that $\operatorname{Aut}(M \times E_n)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n+3,p)$ have isomorphic Sylow $p$-subgroups? For $n=0$ they are isomorphic; and If I'm not mistaken they have the same order for all $n$. Thanks in Advance. 

Given a finite group $H$, How can one prove that the equation $Aut(X)=H$ has only finitely many solutions in the class of finite p-groups. (This would be the case if the divisibility conjecture is true : that is the order of a p-group divides the order of its automorphism group) 

Assume that $G$ has order $pq$, where $p\neq q$ are primes. Can $G$ satisfy a generalized identity of degree $p$? 

First I note that your assertion about Alperin's theorem is not true for $p=2$. I think the answer to your second question is negative. There is $p$-groups ($p>3$) having abelian subgroups of index $p^{\frac{p+3}{2}}$, and no normal abelian subgroup of that index. In particular, for $p=5$ the analogue of Alperin's theorem for the index $p^4$ is false. Such a counter example can be found in Berkovich's book "Groups of prime power order I" (see §39) 

Let $A \to B$ be a finitely generated homomorphism between two commutative noetherian rings. As far as I understand, in various generalizations of this situation, such a map is called smooth if $B$ is a perfect object in $D(B\otimes_A B)$. (See for example Definition 2.2 of $URL$ Is this true for commutative noetherian rings? That is, is a finite type map $A\to B$ is smooth if and only if $B$ has a finite projective dimension over $B\otimes_A B$? Note that one direction (that smoothness implies finite projective dimension) is true because of EGA IV Proposition 17.12.4 which says that the kernel of $B\otimes_A B\to B$ is locally generated by a regular sequence. But does the converse holds? Edit: the answer below shows that surjections, for example, are a counterexample. What if in addition we assume flatness of the map $A\to B$, so that $B\otimes^L_A B \cong B\otimes_A B$? 

In general, if $A$ is a commutative ring and $I$ is a finitely generated ideal in $A$, given an $I$-adically complete $A$-module $M$, and a multiplicative set $S \subseteq A$, when working in the adic category, one usually replaces the usual localization $S^{-1}M$ by exactly what you described - the complete localization $\Lambda_I (S^{-1}M)$ where $\Lambda_I$ is the completion functor. This behaves in many ways like the usual localization. For example, in ring theory a module $M$ is the zero module if and only if $M_p = 0$ for all $p \in Spec A$. If $A$ and $M$ are $I$-adically complete, one may replace this operation by the complete localization, and show that such a complete module $M$ is zero if and only if for all open primes $p$, one has that $\Lambda_I(M_p) = 0$. (Note that this is false if $M$ is not complete. For example, any injective module $J$ will have that $\Lambda_I(J_p)=0$). Well, if you want to continue working with the ideal-theoretic stuff, I suppose you can cheat, view such a module $M$ as a $k[[x]]$-module (under the forgetful functor), and still demand your module to be $(x)$-adically complete. 

Given a finite nilpotent group $G$ and let us denote by $L_n(G)$ the set of left $n$-Engel elements in $G$. Assume that $n$ is the smallest positive integer such that $L_n(G)=G$. Is it true that $G$ is always generated by $G-L_{n-1}(G)$? 

If such a $G$ exist, then clearly $q$ should be greater than $p$. Less trivial, $q \mod p$ should not generate $\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}$. 

Let $G$ be a finite minimally $d$-generated $p$-group. If $G$ is relatively free, that is $G$ is a quotient of the free group $F$ on $d$ generators by a fully invariant subgroup of $F$, then the order of $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ reaches its maximal value $|\Phi(G)|^d|\operatorname{GL}(d,p)|$. I thaink this holds also if $G$ is a quotient of $F$ by a characteristic subgroup. Is the converse true? that is, is true that if $|\operatorname{Aut}(G)|=|\Phi(G)|^d|\operatorname{GL}(d,p)|$, then $G$ is a quotient of the free group on $d$ generators by a characteristic subgroup? Thanks in advance. 

A finitely generated soluble group which satisfies a generalized identity of an arbitrary degree $n$ is not necessarily finite (the infinite dihedral group satisfies an identity of degree $4$). More generally, there is an infinite f.g metabelian group which satisfies a generalized identity of degree $n^2$, for any integer $n\geq 2$. 

Suppose $(A,\mathfrak{a})$ and $(B,\mathfrak{b})$ are two adically complete (commutative) noetherian rings. Let $f:A \to B$ be a continuous formally smooth formally of finite type map (that is, $B/\mathfrak{b}$ is a finitely generated $A$-algebra). In this case it is proved in EGA IV that $\Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}} \Omega^1_{B/A}$ is a projective module of finite rank, where $\Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}}$ denotes the $\mathfrak{b}$-adic completion functor. In a (not nessecerily) adic case, if $f:A \to B$ is formally smooth and of finite type, it is proved that there that $f$ is actually smooth, so that letting $I = \ker (B\otimes_A B \to B)$, we have that $I$ is locally generated by a regular sequence (from which it follows that $\Omega^1_{B/A} \cong I/I^2$ is locally free). Now, to my question: Again, assume we are in the adic case as above. As seen above, the module of Kähler differentials, $\Omega^1_{B/A}$ is no longer the "correct" object, but its completion is. Set $\mathfrak{b}^e = \mathfrak{b} \otimes_A B + B \otimes_A \mathfrak{b} \subseteq B\otimes_A B$, and let $J = \ker( \Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}^e} B\otimes_A B \to B)$. Then we have that $J/J^2 \cong \Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}} \Omega^1_{B/A}$. Is it true that $J$ is locally generated by a regular sequence? that is, is the map $\Lambda_{\mathfrak{b}^e} B\otimes_A B \to B$ a regular immersion? Thanks! 

Having a finite $p$-group $G$ ($p$ odd). we denote by $\Omega_1(G)$ the subgroup generated by all the elements of $G$ of order dividing $p$. Is there an example of such a group $G$, such that $|G:G^p|>|\Omega_1(G)|$? Assume now that $|G:G^p|>|H:H^p|$, whenever $H<G$. Is it true that $G$ has exponent $p$? Thanks in advance. 

Let $G$ be a group. Let us say that $G$ satisfies a generalized identity of degree $n$ if there exist $a_1,a_2,\dots a_n \in G$ such that $$x^{a_1}x^{a_2}\dots x^{a_n}=1,$$ for all $x\in G$. 

Is there a finite $p$-group $G$ such that : (a) $G= \langle A,x,y \rangle$, with $G/Z(G)$ has exponent $p$, $A$ is a maximal abelian normal subgroup of $G$, and $G/A$ has order $p^2$ (thus it is elementary abelian of rank $2$); (b) the class of $G$ is equal to $p$; (c) the subgroup $\langle B,y \rangle$ has class exactly $p$, where $B$ denotes the center of $\langle A,x \rangle$. Thanks in advance 

Let be $G=F/F^p[F,F,F]$, with $F$ denotes the free group on $n$ generators. Then $G$ satisfies $Z(G) = \Phi (G)=G'$. If $x \in G-Z(G)$ then $C_G(x)= \langle x, Z(G) \rangle$ which is abelian as $C_G(x)/Z(G)$ is cyclic. Now we have your condition (1). For (2) observe that $C_G(x)$ has index $p^{n-1}$ in $G$, whenever $x \notin Z(G)$. You can also consider any non-abelian $p$-groups (of order $>p^3$) with a center of index $p^2$. Clearly, for such a group the centralizer of any non-central element $x$ is a maximal subgroup, so has index $p$. 

Assume $R$ is a noetherian ring (not necessarily local). As mentioned in the comments, there is a short exact sequence: $ 0 \to a^n/b^n \to R/b^n \to R/a^n \to 0$ Let $R \to I$ be an injective resolution. Then we get an exact sequence of complexes $0 \to Hom_R(R/a^n,I) \to Hom_R(R/b^n,I) \to Hom_R(a^n/b^n,I) \to 0$. Passing to the limit, and remembering that taking direct limits is an exact operation, we get an exact sequence $0 \to \varinjlim Hom_R(R/a^n,I) \to \varinjlim Hom_R(R/b^n,I) \to \varinjlim Hom_R(a^n/b^n,I) \to 0$. Now, the leftmost complex is quasi-isomorphic to $R\Gamma_a I = R\Gamma_a R = K^\infty(a)$. Similarly, the middle complex is quasi-isomorphic to $K^{\infty}(b)$. Thus, we get an exact sequence of complexes $0 \to K^\infty(a) \to K^\infty(b) \to \varinjlim Hom_R(a^n/b^n,I) \to 0$. Now, if $a$ is generated by $n$ elements, then $K^{\infty}(a)$ lives in degrees $0$ to $n$. Thus, I believe that the question of your $Ext$ being non-zero depends on the minimal number of generators of $a$ and $b$. 

It fails. For example, let $R$ be the ring of germs of smooth real functions at the origin, and let $I$ be the ideal generated by $x$. Now take the function $f(x) = e^{-1/x^2}$. The Taylor expansion of $f$ at $0$ is $0$, so $f$ belongs to $\bigcap_{n=0}^{\infty} I^n$, but $f$ is clearly not the zero function. 

Let $p$ be a fixed prime. A group $G$ is termed $p$-central if every element of order $p$ in $G$ lies in the center. Having a finite $p$-group $G$ of rank $k$ (the least integer, such that every subgroup of $G$ is $k$-generated), one can prove that $G$ has a normal $p$-central subgroup of index bounded in terms of $k$. This can be proved by taking the centralizer $C$ of a maximal normal elementary abelian subgroup $A$ of $G$; the index of $C$ is clearly bounded in terms of the rank of $A$, and so in terms of $k$, and $C$ is $p$-central by a nice result of Alperin (or, in fact, of Thompson and Feit) which says that every element of order $p$ in $G$ which commutes with $A$ lies in $A$. On the other hand, one can consider the set of all normal subgroups $N$ of $G$, for which $G/N$ is $p$-central. A nice fact is that the quotient of $G$ by the intersection $L(G)$ of all such subgroups, is still $p$-central; so $G/L(G)$ is the unique largest $p$-central quotient of $G$. Is it true that that the order of $L(G)$ is bounded in terms of $k$ the rank of $G$? Thanks in advance 

As explained in the other answers, in general there is a problem of seperatedness. If $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathfrak{a}^n \ne 0$ then the topology is not Hausdorff. On the positive side however, you have for example Krull's intersection theorem which says that if $A$ is a noetherian integral domain, then for any proper ideal $\mathfrak{a}$, the $\mathfrak{a}$-adic topology is seperated, and hence, metrizable. 

I know that this was answered at the comments, but I want to emphasize that actually, the completion functor is not exact from either side, not from the left and not from the right. The only thing that is true (over noetherian or non-noetherian rings) is that completion preserves surjection: Let $k$ be a field, $A=k[[t]]$, $I=(t)$. In $URL$ example 3.20, there is an example of a short exact sequence of $A$-modules $0 \to P \to Q \to M \to 0$, such that after completion, the resulting sequence $0 \to \hat{P} \to \hat{Q} \to \hat{M} \to 0$ is not even exact at $\hat{Q}$. Thus, completion is no even exact at the middle! As for tensoring with the completion ring, this is of course a question of flatness. It is know clasically that if $A$ is noetherian then the completion map is flat. More generally, the completion map does not have to be flat. If $A$ is a ring which is not coherent, then taking $B=A[x]$ and $I=(x)$ will give you an example of a ring with non-flat completion. Note however that in this case, not only your ring is non-noetherian, but also its completion is non-noetherian. It is an open question to me if there is a ring with noetherian completion such that the completion map is not flat. 

Let $G$ be a finite abelian $p$-group. What is known about the minimal number of generators of a $p$-sylow of $Aut(G)$? is it bounded in terms of $d(G)$ the minimal number of generators of $G$ (and perhaps $p$)? 

Determine all the integers $n$, such that every f.g soluble group which satisfies a generalized identity of degree $n$ is finite. (The set of these integers contains $2$ and $3$. And it contains all the primes if the first question has a negative answer. If I'm not mistaken, this set contains all the primes if one replaces "soluble" by "metabelian"). 

Let $G$ be a group of odd order. It is known that if every central automophism of $G$ acts trivially on the center, then $G$ is purely non-abelain, this amounts to saying that every central endomorphism $u$ of $G$ (an endomorphism such that $x^{-1}u(x) \in Z(G)$, for all $x \in G$) is an automorphism. I could generalize this (using some ring theory) to the case of the automorphisms acting trivially on a quotient of an abelain normal subgroup: Let $A$ be an abelian normal subgroup of $G$. If every automorphism of $G$ acting trivially on $G/A$ leaves $A$ elementwise fixed, then every endomorphism of $G$ acting trivially on $G/A$ is an automorphism. I wonder if one can see a straightforward purely group theoretic proof of this result. Thanks in advance. 

This is not a direct answer to your question, but a few comments about the topic. First, in general it is not true that $\Omega^1_{B/A}$ is a free module. In fact, assuming $A \to B$ is flat and finitely generated, $\Omega^1_{B/A}$ is locally free if and only if $A \to B$ is a smooth ring map. If in your situation (or any other adic formally smooth situation) you take the completion of $\Omega^1_{B/A}$ then you are guaranteed to get a projective module of the correct rank (and in your particular case you would indeed get the free module of rank 1 you expected). This is proved in EGA 0.IV, theorem 20.4.9. I think that the module of finite derivations should coincide with this completion. I recommend you check the book "Kahler Differentials" by Ernst Kunz which discusses the module of universal finite derivations. Edit: remark 1.8 in $URL$ claims that indeed this completion coincides with the module of universal finite derivations, thus providing a positive answer to your question. 

The answer is no. Let $k$ be a field. Let $A=k[x]/x^2$, and let $B=k$. $A$ is Artinian, so it is Cohen Macaulay. $B$ is clearly Cohen Macaulay. But the only non-trivial ideal in $A$ is $(x)$ which is not generated by a regular sequence, because every element of it is a zero-divisor.
