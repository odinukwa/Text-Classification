You could definitely define a smooth structure on $\text{Diff}(M)$ in the vicinity of the identity by declaring your maps $X \mapsto \phi_X$ or $X \mapsto e^{tX}|_{t=1}$ to be diffeomorphisms onto. However, the topology induced by this procedure is not the natural topology which one would expect, i.e. the subspace topology induced from the $C^\infty$-compact open topology on $C^\infty(M, M)$. The failure of local surjectivity of $\text{Vec}(M) \to \text{Diff}(M)$ says exactly that reasonable small vector fields does not necessarily have flows which are close to the identity. While this is sometimes inconvenient, in my opinion it is better to live with it instead of refining the topology to something 'unnatural'. 

There is indeed a deep relation between Lagrangian submanifolds, the Fourier transformation and microlocal analysis. This is extensively discussed in Bates and Weinstein: Lectures on the Geometry of Quantization. Let me illustrate the basics idea in the simplest case. Assume we are given an Lagrangian immersion $\iota: L \to T^* R = R^2$. Projecting on the $p$-component yields a map $\pi_p: L \to R$. If $\pi_p$ is a diffeomorphism then, for every half-density $a$ on $L$, we can define a function $B$ on the momentum line $R$ by $$ B |dp|^{1/2} = \pi_p^* \, e^{i \tau} a .$$ Here $\tau: L \to \ R$ is a "generalized phase function" satisfying $d \tau = \iota^* \theta$ with $\theta$ being the canonical 1-form on $T^* R$. Taking the inverse Fourier transformation of $B(p)$ yields a function $F(q)$ living on the configuration space. Hence, we see that indeed the Fourier transformation of $F$ is related to the Lagrangian immersion $\iota$. However, your formula $\mathcal{F}(\exp(i f)) \approx \exp(i\mathcal{L}f)$ is a little bit to naive and just works under certain non-degeneracy assumptions. (If $\pi_p$ fails to be a diffeomorphism, then you need to include further corrections - these include the Maslov index of the Lagrangian immersion). So what is the relation to quantum mechanics? If your $F: Q \to R$ satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, then it may serve as the phase function of a first-order approximate solution of Schrödinger’s equation. In other words, the WKB ansatz $e^{i / \hbar F(q)}$ is then a first-order approximation. More generally, you could also consider approximate solutions of the form $a\,e^{i / \hbar F}$, where the amplitude $a$ is essentially the half-density $a$ living on $L$ as above. 

Let $\{\alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_r\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ be a finite subset of lattice points and let $\Phi: (\mathbb{C}^*)^n \to \mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$ be the corresponding map from the algebraic torus to the projective space defined by: $$\Phi(x) = (x^{\alpha_0}: \cdots : x^{\alpha_r}).$$ Here $x^\alpha$ is short for $x_1^{a_1} \cdots x_n^{a_n}$, $\alpha = (a_1, \ldots, a_n)$. For simplicity let us assume that $\Phi$ is an embedding. Consider the standard Fubini-Study metric on $\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^r$ and equip the torus $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ with the pull-back metric which we call $g$. It is clearly a metric invariant by the action of the compact subgroup $(S^1)^n$. Let us decompose $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$ as $\mathbb{R}^n \times (S^1)^n$ by $(r, \theta) \mapsto e^{r+i\theta}$. Then we can consider $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a subset of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^n$. My question is if one can describe the geodesics of $g$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$? Is it true that the geodesics are straight lines? 

For a Lie group $G$ let $EG \to BG$ denote the universal bundle. A Lie group homomorphism $\rho: G \to H$ determines a map $B \rho: BG \to BH$ as the classifying map for the principal $H$-bundle $EG \times_\rho H \to BG$. While this argument yields existence of $B \rho$ (and uniqueness up to homotopy) it is far from being explicit. Does there exist a true construction of $B \rho$? If $\rho$ is a embedding of a subgroup, then on gets the classifying map by a quotient procedure. I was hoping for a similar result for arbitrary group homomorphism. Assume anything you want on $H$ (compactness ect). 

This map is not smooth for every vector space topology on the dual space, see Remark I.3.9. in Neeb, K.-H. "Towards a Lie theory of locally convex groups" 2006 for an explicit counterexample. Thus the cotangent bundle does not carry a (natural) smooth structure for Fréchet manifolds and one has to specify what one understands under smooth differential forms more directly. The usual way is to require the chart representation of the differential $k$-form $\alpha$ to be smooth as as a map $\alpha: U \times F^k \to \mathbb{R}$ (see Definition I.4.1 in the above paper). 

Let $X_\sigma$ be an affine toric variety for an action of a torus $T$ and let $\mathcal{P}$ be a toric principal $G$-bundle over $X_\sigma$ where $G$ is an affine algebraic group (here base field $k$ is algebraically closed and characteristic $0$, in fact I am content with $k = \mathbb{C}$). By a toric principal $G$-bundle $\mathcal{P}$ we mean $T$ acts on $\mathcal{P}$ lifting its action on $X_\sigma$ and the $T$-action and $G$-action on $\mathcal{P}$ commute. My question is wether $\mathcal{P}$ is $T$-equivariantly trivial. By this, we mean the following: there exists a homomorphism $\phi: T \to G$ such that $\mathcal{P}$ is $T$-equivariantly isomorphic to $X_\sigma \times G$ where $T$ acts on this product diagonally by acting on $G$ via $\phi$ and left multiplication, that is, $t \cdot (x, g) = (t \cdot x, \phi(x)g)$. It is well-known and not difficult to show that this is true when $G = GL(n)$ (that is, one has a toric vector bundle). As far as I know by a result of Biswas-Dey-Poddar (2015) which itself relies on an earlier result of Heinzner-Kutzschebauch (1995), this is true for when $X_\sigma$ is complex affine space. I was wondering if this is known for other affine toric varieties. 

First, there is a canonical isomorphism $\Phi$ between $\Omega^k(M; Ad P)$ and $\Omega^k_{Ad, h}(P; \mathfrak{g})$, where the subscripts signify that the form is horizontal and of type $Ad$ (i.e. equivariant). This isomorphism is canonical and does not need a local trivialization. To illustrate the idea, consider the case $k=0$. A section $\varphi$ of the adjoint bundle defines a function $\Phi(\varphi)$ on $P$ with values in $\mathfrak{g}$ by $\varphi(m) = [p, \Phi(\varphi) (p)]$ where $\pi(p) = m$. In your notation, $\Phi^{-1}(F) = \mathcal{F}$. Next, the exterior differential in the adjoint bundle (indeed in every associated bundle) is defined by making the following diagram commutative: $$\begin{matrix} \Omega^k_{Ad, h}(P; \mathfrak{g}) & \overset{D}{\to} & \Omega^{k+1}_{Ad, h}(P; \mathfrak{g}) \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ \Omega^k(M; Ad P) & \overset{d_{\nabla}}{\to} & \Omega^{k+1}(M; Ad P) \end{matrix}$$ (the vertical arrows being the isomorphism $\Phi$) Thus $D F = 0$ coincides with $d_{\nabla}\mathcal{F} = 0$ under the isomorphism $\Phi$. Finally, there is also the viewpoint via local trivializations. Locally, we can identify the connection form with a Lie algebra valued 1-form $\tilde{A}$ on $M$ and the curvature is a 2-form $\tilde{F}$ on $M$ with values in the Lie algebra. It is an easy calculation to see that $D$ locally takes the form $\widetilde{D F} = d \tilde{F} + [\tilde{A}, \tilde{F}]$, i.e. the local representant of $DF$ is given by the right-hand side. Note that this expression only makes sense locally, since the differential of $\mathcal{F}$ as a vector-valued 2-form is not well-defined (without a connection). Nonetheless, $d_\nabla$ is always defined and can be applied to $\mathcal{F}$ without any problems. 

Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $k$. I was wondering if there is a standard terminology for a function $v: V \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{R}$ which is invariant under multiplication by nonzero scalars and satisfies non-Archimedean inequality $v(x+y) \geq \min\{v(x), v(y)\}$? In the paper "Newton-Okounkov bodies, semigroups of intergral points, graded algebras and intersection theory", the authors call such a function a "pre-valuation", I was wondering if this concept has been introduced before and if there are other terms used for it. Of course, this is related to the notion of ultra-metric. Thanks 

Hal Schenck kindly provided a counter-example to the claim in question. Consider the twisted cubic: (the code is in Macaulay) o3 I = ideal (- y^2 + x*z, - y*z + x*w, - z^2 + y*w) i4 : J = ideal leadTerm I o4 = ideal (z^2 , y*z, y^2 ) i5 : hilbertPolynomial coker gens ideal leadTerm I^2 o5 = - 16*P + 9*P 0 1 i6 : hilbertPolynomial coker gens ideal leadTerm J^2 o6 = - 20*P_0 + 10*P_1 So, the quotient is actually positive dimensional. 

As an simple example with infinitely many different stabilizer subgroups you may take countably many disks. Since each disk may be rotated independently with a different speed, we obtain an action of $ U(1) $ such that all the subgroups $ \mathbb Z / n \mathbb Z$ with $ n \in \mathbb N $ occur as stabilizer. Of course the example obtained in this way is disconnected and even has infinitely many connected components. However, one can use the same strategy to obtain a connected manifold with infinitely many distinct stabilizer groups. The idea is to embed the collection of disks in a bigger space and "smear" the action between them. Details can be found in an old paper "On a problem of Montgomery" by C.T. Yang. 

I was wondering what are some standard general references/books/survey articles about: (1) crystal bases, and string parameterizations and (2) Demazure modules, and Schubert varieties (containing basic definitions and proofs of most of the basic statements). I need to cite some general references on these subjects in a paper of mine. 

Let $X$ be a set with a collection of subsets $\mathcal{A}$. A finitely additive measure on $(X, \mathcal{A})$ is a function $\mu: \mathcal{A} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ such that for any two subsets $A, B \in \mathcal{A}$ we have $\mu(A \cup B) = \mu(A) + \mu(B) - \mu(A \cap B)$. Now consider the set $\mathcal{L}$ of all linear subspaces of a given finite dimensional vector space $V$. The dimension of subspaces satisfies an equality similar to a finitely additive measure. That is, for any two subspaces $W, U \in \mathcal{L}$ we have $\dim(U+W) = \dim(U) + \dim(W) - \dim(U \cap W)$. My question: Is there a generalized notion of measure which includes dimension of vector spaces (and one can define analogues of integration for it)? For example is there a generalized notion of a measure on a lattice (where intersection and union are replaced with meet and join)? Thanks 

Yes, the spaces are isomorphic as Fréchet spaces. This is often called the exponential law and holds for every compact manifolds $M$ and $N$, $$C^\infty(M \times N) = C^\infty(M, C^\infty(N))$$ and as a corollary you obtain that both space are tame in the sense of Hamilton. A proof of this exponential map can be found in the book "The Convenient Setting of Global Analysis" by Andreas Kriegl and Peter W. Michor. Or see Glöckner's lecture notes around Proposition 4.5.4 for further comments about the exponential law. 

I'm interested in the case where $E$ is not a vector space but a finite-dimensional Lie group and the differential equation is adapted accordingly. 

In the abelian case, I can answer this question as follows: Let $\gamma_s$ be a family of loops which represent a tangential vector $X \in T_\gamma L_mM$, that is $\gamma_0 = \gamma$ and $\frac{d}{ds}{\big|_0} \gamma_s = X$. Then the derivative of $Hol_p$ in the direction of $X$ evaluates to $$ \frac{d}{ds}{\big|_0} Hol_p (\gamma_s) = \frac{d}{ds}{\big|_0} \exp (\int_{\gamma_s} A) = (\exp)'_0 \int_0^1 \frac{d}{ds}{\big|_0} A(\dot \gamma_s(t)) dt = \int_0^1 dA(\frac{d}{ds}{\big|_0} \gamma_s(t), \dot \gamma_0(t)) dt, $$ That is, in this case we get a close expression for the derivative of $Hol_p$ at an arbitary loop $\gamma$ in terms of the curvature $F_A = dA$. Furthermore, the Ambrose-Singer theorem follows from this expression. I was hoping to get a similar result also for the non-abelian case. Sidequestion: conjugacy classes of (topological) homomorphisms $h$ between the loop gorup and $G$ uniquely determine a equivalence class of principal bundles with curvature by a result of Kobayashi (1954). Which additional properties on $h$ have to be impsoed to characterize all (equivalence classes of) connections on a fixed principal bundle $P$. 

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group acting on a projective variety $X$. Let $L$ be a $G$-linearized (very) ample line bundle on $X$, and let $R$ be the ring of sections (or homogeneous coordinate ring of $(X, L)$). Let $R_k = H^0(X, L^{\otimes k})$ denote the $k$-th graded piece of $R$, and $R_{k, \lambda}$ its $\lambda$ isotypic component where $\lambda$ is a dominant weight. Consider the GIT quotient $X //_\lambda G$ i.e. $Proj(\bigoplus_k R_{k, k\lambda})$. Then one can define the volume of this GIT quotient $f(\lambda) = vol(X //_\lambda G)$ say as the leading coefficient of the Hilbert polynomial of the graded algebra $\bigoplus_k R_{k, k\lambda}$ times $d!$ where $d = dim(X //_\lambda G)$. By homogeneity one can extend f to rational values of $\lambda$. (When $X$ is smooth $f$ is just the Duistermaat-Heckman function in symplectic geometry on the moment/Kirwan polytope.) Question: Under what conditions is f continuous at 0, i.e. as \lambda approaches $0$, $f(\lambda)$ approaches $f(0)$ (we consider $f$ as a function on the moment polytope and we assume that $0$ in on the boundary of the moment polytope)? Little bit weaker questions is: when can we find a sequence of regular dominant $\lambda_i$ approaching $0$ such that $f(\lambda_i)$ approaches $f(0)$? Clearly a sufficient condition for continuity of $f$ is that $X$ is smooth and $0$ is a regular value of the moment map. For example, is $f$ continuous under the assumption that generic orbits of the action of $G$ on $Spec(R)$ (cone over $X$) are closed? 

Yes, the form $\Omega$ is closed and defines indeed a weak symplectic structure. This can be verified by a direct but a bit messy calculation. A cleaner way would be to generalize the ideas of Vizman: Induced differential forms on manifolds of functions to the case of sections of non-trivial bundles. In case you wonder what the momentum maps are: 

If you take the compact-open ($C^\infty$) topology (instead of the Whitney one), then you have continuity/smoothness of the evaluation map and the following exponential laws $$ C(M \times N, P) = C(M, C(N, P)) $$ $$ C^\infty(M \times N, R) = C^\infty(M, C^\infty(N, R)) $$ if $N$ is a (locally compact) manifold without boundary, $M$ and $P$ are manifolds and $R$ is a vector space (possibly infinite-dimensional). In particular, for a compact manifold $N$ the above exponential laws also hold for the Whitney topology (which of course coincides with the compact-open topology in this case). More details can be found for example in some lecture notes by H. Glöckner. Also Michor's "Convienient Calculus" book contains a discussion of these matters but there a different topology on the space of smooth maps is used.
