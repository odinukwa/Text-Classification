The motivation is I believe clearly stated in p. 197 beginning of the section, where they write that they want to use Second-order stochastic dominance to reflect comparisons related to "riskiness/dispersion". To make this prominent, they use distributions with the same mean, so that it is obvious that we compare them not w.r.t their means, but w.r.t. riskiness/dispersion. In fact, the authors use the concept as equivalent to the stochastic dominance over mean-preserving spreads (see proposition 6.D.2 p. 199). Using the general definition (which is defined by what they provide as property 6.D.2 p. 198) would not have offered them something more, in view of the reasons they want to use the concept. 

From a mathematical point of view, if the function $f(x,y)$ is homogeneous (of any degree), and $g()$ is a function whose first derivative is everywhere non-zero, then the function $$H(x, y) = g[f(x,y)]$$ is homothetic. In economics, we usually impose something more restrictive, namely that $g' >0$. But this makes a homothetic function a monotonic transformation of a homogeneous function. Now, homogeneous functions are a strict subset of homothetic functions: not all homothetic functions are homogeneous. Therefore, not all monotonic transformations preserve the homogeneity property of a utility function. The simplest example is Cobb-Douglas utility. It is homogeneous of degree one. In an ordinal utility framework, we are ok with monotonic transformations, so we can consider the natural logarithm of it. Fine, but the natural logarithm will not preserve homogeneity. Nevertheless it will be homothetic. The fundamental property of a homothetic function is that its expansion path is linear (this is a property also of homogeneous functions, and thankfully it proves to be a property of the more general class of homothetic functions). In consumption theory, this means that, keeping the prices or the price ratio constant, if we vary the income of the consumer, in the $(x,y)$ plane the tangency point of the income constraint with the highest feasible indifference curve will always reflect a fixed ratio $x/y$. This in turn implies that expenditures for each good grow all at the same rate as income, and so expenditure shares remain constant for the whole income range (always for a given price ratio). While this may sound restrictive, in fact, it has been shown that homothetic preferences do not impose any special restrictions on aggregate demand (essentially due to the endowment vector being arbitrary and independent of preferences, which messes, or frees, things up). 

Results in Economics can be fully rigorously argued, ever since Economics adopted mathematical symbolism to express itself. The issue is not with the process of argumentation, but with the premises one starts from. 

To stick to the simpler deterministic case, it is perfect foresight and the Transvarsality condition (TVC)that guarantees that an optimizing agent will stay on the saddle-path, because all other paths lead to the violation of TVC (corner solutions violate the TVC). In a deterministic environment and with perfect foresight the agent knows this and so he sticks to the saddle path. The chapter on the basic Ramsey model in Barrow and Sala-i-Martin's Growth book has a good discussion on the matter. 

The emphasis is mine. Such reasoning is sustained by the following interpretation of the meaning/ definition of the word "loss": $$\text{Loss is any foregone opportunity for gain.}$$ Let's see how this works. Assume I enter willfully and freely into a transaction and the same holds for the other guy, who after the transaction will move abroad. Expressing utilities in monetary (willingness-to-pay) terms, what I give has willingness-to-pay for me say $10$, while what I receive has $12$. So it appears that, after the transaction, I am better off, by $12-10 = 2$... No I am not: I just experienced a loss here: I forfeited the opportunity to get the other guy's stuff without giving up anything. In that case I would have ended up with $10+12 = 22$. Currently, I have only $12$. So this transaction created a loss for me, equal to $22-12 = 10$, given how "loss" is defined. Mind you, there is folk belief that such a definition for "loss" is not just a twisting of words and meanings, but it characterizes the "venturous spirits". The above only shows that if such terms are not defined somewhat strictly and, unavoidably, narrowly, useful conversation around them is difficult if not impossible -let alone answering a question about them. 

In the Solow-Swan model, the interest rate will be determined by market-equilibrium: under the baseline assumption of competitive markets (and constant-returns-to-scale technology), we get the familiar per-period equilibrium relation $$f'(k) = r + \delta \tag{1}$$ Regarding the rate of pure time preference, think of the following: in this model, savings is a fixed percentage of output. So consumption is also a fixed percentage of output: $$c = (1-s)f(k) \implies \dot c = (1-s)f'(k)\dot k \tag{2}$$ while also we have $$\dot k = sf(k) - (n+\delta)k \tag{3}$$ Combining, we have $$\dot c = (1-s)f'(k)\cdot [sf(k) - (n+\delta)k]$$ $$= (1-s)f(k)f'(k)s - (1-s)f'(k)(n+\delta)k$$ and using the previous relations, $$\dot c = s(r+\delta)c - (1-s)(r+\delta)(n+\delta)k \tag{4}$$ In the "Ramsey" model with consumer intertemporal utility maximization, we get the relation (for log-utility for simplicity) $$\dot c = (r-\rho(t)) c \tag{5}$$ Note that I made the rate of pure time preference time-varying and this is indeed the case when we examine time-varying preference rates in the Ramsey model (see for example Barro, R. J. (1999). Ramsey meets Laibson in the neoclassical growth model. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1125-1152). For the consumers in the Solow-Swan model to behave like the consumer's that optimize intertemporaly equation $(4)$ must be equivalent to equation $(5)$ so (using now the time variable to clearly indicate what is time-varying and what is not), we get after eliminating and re-arranging $$s(r(t)+\delta)c(t) - (1-s)(r(t)+\delta)(n+\delta)k(t) =[r(t)-\rho(t)] c(t)$$ $$\implies \big[s(r(t)+\delta) - r(t)+\rho(t)]c(t) = (1-s)(r(t)+\delta)(n+\delta)k(t)$$ $$\implies \rho(t) = (1-s)(r(t)+\delta)(n+\delta)\frac {k(t)}{c(t)} +r(t) - s[r(t)+\delta]$$ $$\implies \rho(t) = (r(t)+\delta)(n+\delta)\frac {k(t)}{f(k(t))} +r(t) - s[r(t)+\delta]$$ The consistent rate of pure time preference is endogenous, and time-varying under diminishing marginal product of capital, and becomes constant only in the steady state. The relation tells us to what $\rho(t)$ must be equal so that the optimizing consumer finds optimal to maintain a constant savings rate. If the production function has constant output elasticities (say, Cobb-Douglas $f(k) = Ak^a$), then the above simplifies to $$\rho(t) = (n+\delta)a - s\delta + (1-s)r(t) $$ or $$\rho(t) = (n+\delta)a - \delta + (1-s)f'(k(t)) $$ so it is still time varying (it would be constant in a model with constant marginal product of capital). If capital increases to its steady state, we see that the consistent rate of pure time preference should fall over time (which is also the result we get in the Ramsey model with time varying $\rho$). At the steady-state we have $f'(k^*) = a(n+\delta)/s$ so $$\implies \rho^* = (n+\delta)a - \delta + \frac{(1-s)a(n+\delta)}{s}$$ $$\implies \rho^* = \frac {an+ (a-s)\delta}{s}$$ That's a nice one since $a$ is the golden-rule savings rate. To mimic the Ramsey model we should set therefore $s<a$ so we will be to the left of the golden rule (and even in the Solow context, setting $s >a$ is dynamically inefficient). Then the steady-state consistent $\rho$ will certainly be positive. Just for a taste, set $a=0.45, s=0.35, n=0.01, \delta =0.05$, to get $$\rho^* \approx 0.027$$ Not far from the benchmark value $\rho =0.02$. 

No, I would not say that this resolves the Machina paradox, because it is exactly the same as the Machina paradox: the paradox does indeed require from you to look at the three possible outcomes. The M-C/W/G book discuss only the $B$ and $C$ outcomes because it is there where the paradox focuses on whether a violation of the axiom of independence may happen. But most importantly, Machina did not argue that all people will have preference ordering $A>C>B$. He argued that it is reasonable, for evident psychological reasons, to expect that some people may... So some others will have the ordering $A>B>C$, which does conform to expected utility framework. The first will say "I cannot watch a movie about Paris after losing the trip - I will smash the TV!" The second will say "Well, tough luck. At least I will see it on screen and keep dreaming about it". Both seem like behaviors that could be anticipated by "usual" human beings. The point of the paradox is not to show that Expected Utility (EU) is invalid for all people -only that it may be violated in reasonable situations, i.e. situations that may characterize a lot of people and may happen often. What paradoxes like this examine and contemplate, is the degree to which EU represents adequately the "majority" of people in some sense, and so whether it is valid/useful/not-misleading as a core theoretical assumption in economic models, or not. And this is a matter of degree, a quantitative matter. This is true for almost all assumptions in theoretical models in social sciences. 

One way to navigate rather safely in National Accounting Identities, is to put on the one side "what you have available" and on the other side "what you do with it". In the specific case ($M$ being imports) we would have $$GDP + M = C + I + G + X$$ "What we have available" is what we produce and what we import. "What we do with it" is a) consume it b) invest it c) let the government incur expenses and d) export it (note that we can export not only what we produce but also what we have imported). I believe it is all reasonable. Then, rearranging, $$GDP = C + I + G + (X-M)$$ the term in the parenthesis being "net exports". 

As the OP corrected in the comments, using $K=20, w=800$, and $r=500$, so $TC = 10000 + 800L$, we get , in the $\{Q,C\}$ space 

In a two-good space, initially the consumer maximizes $U(x,z)\;\; s.t. \;\;p_xx+p_zz =I$ and we assume it obtains the solution $(x^*, z^*)$ as a function of prices and income. In the constrained case, the consumer will either choose $(0, \tilde z)$ or $(x^*+\epsilon, z'$), for some $\epsilon >0 $ always exhausting its budget, so in particular, $\tilde z = I/p_z$. In order for the consumer to still choose to buy a strictly positive quantity of $x$, it must be the case that $$U(x^*+\epsilon, z') > U(0, \tilde z)$$ Apply a first order approximation around $(x^*, z^*)$ without ignoring the remainders, we want \begin{align} U(x^*, z^*) + U_x(x^*)\cdot \epsilon + U_z(z^*)(z'-z^*) + R_{\epsilon} &\\> U(x^*, z^*) + U_x(x^*)(-x^*) + U_z(z^*)(\tilde z-z^*) + R_0 \end{align} Simplify and re-arrange, we want $$U_x(x^*)(x^*+\epsilon) + R_{\epsilon} > U_z(z^*)(\tilde z-z') + R_0 $$ We know that from the unconstrained optimization, $U_x(x^*)/U_z(z^*) = p_x/p_z$ so $$\frac {p_x}{p_z}(x^*+\epsilon) + \frac {R_{\epsilon}}{U_z(z^*)} > \left(\frac{I}{p_z}-z'\right) + \frac {R_0}{U_z(z^*)} $$ Multiply throughout by $p_z$, $$p_x(x^*+\epsilon) + p_z\frac {R_{\epsilon}}{U_z(z^*)} > I - p_zz' + p_z\frac {R_0}{U_z(z^*)} $$ but $p_x(x^*+\epsilon) + p_zz' = I \implies p_x(x^*+\epsilon) = I-p_zz'$ so we are left with the requirement that (ignoring positive terms) $$R_{\epsilon} > R_0 $$ in order for the consumer to choose $x^*+ \epsilon$ and not $0$ for $x$. Note that the above take into account also the signs of the remainders, it is not just about their absolute magnitudes. Now let's go back to our first-order expansions. We know that both candidate bundles yield utilities lower than $U(x^*, z^*)$, because they were feasible in the unconstrained case, and they weren't chosen. Looking at the expansion of $U(0, \tilde z)$ we then conclude that we have $$U_x(x^*)(-x^*) + U_z(z^*)(\tilde z-z^*) + R_0 < 0 $$ $$\implies U_z(z^*)\cdot \Big[(U_x(x^*)/U_z(z^*))\cdot(-x^*) + \tilde z-z^*\Big] + R_0 < 0$$ $$\implies \frac {U_z(z^*)}{p_z}\cdot \Big[-p_xx^* + p_z\tilde z-p_zz^*\Big] + R_0 < 0$$ But $-p_xx^* -p_zz^* = -I$ and $p_z\tilde z =I$ so the term in brackets is zero. Therefore we conclude that $$R_0 <0$$ Looking now at the expansion of $U(x^*+\epsilon, z')$, we know we have $$U_x(x^*)\cdot \epsilon + U_z(z^*)(z'-z^*) + R_{\epsilon} < 0$$ Performing the same manipuations as before we obtain here too that $$R_{\epsilon} < 0$$ So the condition to buy $x^*+\epsilon$ can be re-written as $$|R_{\epsilon}| < |R_0|$$ This formalizes somewhat the notion that if $\epsilon$ is "sufficiently small", $R_{\epsilon}$ will be smaller in absolute terms than $R_0$, since the approximation to the same function will be "better", and so we will observe $x^*+\epsilon$ and not $0$. But it also tells us what the graphs in the other answer told us too, that there is not a single general answer to the matter.
