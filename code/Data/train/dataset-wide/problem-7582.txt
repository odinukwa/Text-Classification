The answer to (2) is "no". Take, for example, $X$ to consist of a countable number of copies of $[0,1]^2$ with the standard metric, where every two points in different components have distance 1000 from one another. Then take $Y$ to be $X$, but with some stuff cut out of one of the components so it looks like an annulus or a letter of the alphabet or some other cute shape. $X$ and $Y$ are clearly not isomorphic, because $Y$ has a weird component and $X$ doesn't. But there's clearly embeddings from each to the other, as you can embed the weird component in a normal one, and the cardinality of components is the same in $X$ and $Y$, whether you count the weird component or not. 

I think this is well-defined. You mean that the images of objects and morphisms in $B$ under $F$ all lie within $D$. It might be slightly clearer to say, "... is a subcategory of $D$" rather than "... lies in $D$" (to avoid a reader thinking that the image has to be a single point for some stupid reason) but this is almost pedantic. 

I'm confused. Take $H$ to be the triangle. Since $G$ is not three-colourable, there is no map from $G$ to $H$, and $H$ contains a triangle. 

There is no standard terminology that I know. But if I had to create one, there are precedents: I would steal from the language of homotopy theory. A model category is a category equipped with a model structure: three special classes of morphisms, called weak equivalences, cofibrations, and fibrations (satisfying some axioms). There is a general construction called the "homotopy category" of a model category $C$: this is in some appropriate sense the universal category with a functor from $C$ which turns weak equivalences into isomorphisms. Thus I'd be comfortable calling morphisms which are sent to isomorphisms equivalences. Quasi-isomorphisms are in fact the weak equivalences for a model structure on the category of chain complexes, so this example is a fortunate one. Sometimes, for some particular examples of model structures, the cofibrations are defined to be the morphisms which are sent to monomorphisms by some natural forgetful functor. Similarly, sometimes the fibrations are the morphisms sent to epimorphisms. Thus I'd be vaguely comfortable using the same terminology for this situation. However, of course, one should be up front about this, to avoid confusing those readers who know about model categories already and might imagine that you are building one. Of course, it may be that in the example you're considering, there really is a model category structure somewhere... 

One should let the properties follow from an interpretation. We didn't write down the axioms for a metric space because they're intrinsically interesting: we wrote them down because they describe the notion of distance. One thing that certainly has been tried is to let $d(x,y,z)$ describe the area of a triangle between the three points $x,y,z$. Then the appropriate axioms are that $d$ be completely symmetric (swapping any two of $x$, $y$ and $z$ gives the same answer) and that $$d(x,y,z) \leq d(a,y,z) + d(x,a,z) + d(x,y,a).$$ In general, one could let $d(x_0,\ldots,x_n)$ be thought of as the $n$-volume of an $n$-simplex. Then the appropriate axioms are complete symmetry again, and a very similar triangle inequality (where the right-hand-side is the sum of what you get by substituting $a$ for each $x_i$). 

If I take an $m$-coloured set and an $n$-coloured set, their disjoint union (using disjoint sets of colours) is an $(m+n)$-coloured set. Conversely, if I have an $(m+n)$-coloured set, it has a subset which uses the first $m$ colours, and another subset which uses the other $n$... While this answer is (perhaps unexpectedly) short, it is worth mentioning that there is a fairly good theory of phenomena like this: Joyal's theory of "combinatorial species". There's a survey article online nowadays. 

If you read Bott and Tu, you can learn both some differential and some algebraic topology at the same time! Unless you're unusually uncompromising, though, this will be heavy going for a beginner. Reading Milnor's book first, as David Steinberg suggests, seems a great idea (and won't take too long either). 

It is known, in fact, that every compact connected abelian Lie group is isomorphic to a torus. Your construction has a danger of producing disconnected subgroups, however: this occurs when the coordinates of $k$ are all multiples of some fixed $i>1$. (You can see this even in small dimensions). 

There is some discussion of coends in $\infty$-categories in my PhD thesis (Sheffield, 2010). I think that, given that the target category $\mathrm{Cat}_\infty^\mathrm{ex}$ is cocomplete, this gives you one way to do it. I have another way, which is arguably rather less fussy, but it is currently not written up in a presentable fashion. 

I wrote a quick and probably impressively sub-optimal computer program to investigate this. It takes two seconds to ascertain that the least integer of additive dimension at least 4 is 49. The relevant partition is $15+14+12+8$. (I say "at least 4" because I haven't checked that it doesn't in fact have additive dimension 5.) 

A conceptually simpler, but perhaps less powerful, way of seeing that $|D|=2^{(n-1)^k}$ is this. First, observe that in any line, the status of any $n-1$ lattice points suffices to determine the last: this is true for parity reasons, since they're always changed two-at-a-time. That means that (by straightforward induction on dimension), a cubical block of $(n-1)^k$ lattice points suffices to determine all the others, so there are at most $2^{(n-1)^k}$ configurations. And it's also easy to see that such a block can be configured in any way, by flipping boxes as appropriate in lexicographical order. Hence there are exactly $2^{(n-1)^k}$ configurations. 

This is not really an answer, just a lengthy comment. I worked out some coefficients of this power series; they might be of use to others. (More are available on demand). 

One can reinterpret a hypergraph as a span-shaped diagram of sets where the left leg of the span is a finite map (meaning, all preimages are finite). Indeed, given a hypergraph, consider the span $$V\leftarrow\lbrace(v,e)\in V\times E\mid v\in h(e)\rbrace\rightarrow E;$$ it is clear that this gives a correspondence. This seems more natural to work with. The category of sets is a topos. The category of diagrams of some given shape in a topos is itself a topos, so the category of span-shaped diagrams of this sort is again a topos. Imposing finiteness conditions tends not to destroy the property of being a topos, and one can rapidly check that philosophy in this case. 

Surely if you take your first example, and put two more green arcs, one in the red circle but not in the blue, and one in the blue circle but not in the red, about as large as they possibly can be, that will hold the configuration fairly rigid and prevent that unlinking operation? I don't see that anything significant can be done here except idly rotating the green circles in place. 

Given a vector $u$ and an orthonormal basis $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, we have $||u||^2 = \left<u,x_1\right>^2 + \cdots + \left<u,x_n\right>^2$. But that means that, if you choose a nonzero $u$, then the function $F(x) = \left<u,x\right>^2$ gives a counterexample. 

It is my understanding that $H^d$ is taken to be trivial unless $d$ is an integer. Hence this is just notation for a degree shift by a rational number. Similarly, in the other formula, the square bracket notation is also just a degree-shift. 

It is not always the case; a counterexample is given by a degree-2 self-map of the circle. A continuous retraction satisfies $\deg(f)^2 = \deg(f^2) = \deg(f)$ and hence has degree either $0$ or $1$. Meanwhile, the self-homeomorphisms have invertible degree, which must therefore be $\pm1$. Compositions of these have degree $-1, 0$ or $1$. 

If you want to encode $n$ natural numbers $a_1,\ldots,a_n$, with $0\leq a_i < B$, then encode it as $a_1 + a_2B + \cdots + a_nB^{n-1}$. 

Let $N$ be a positive integer. Thanks to the Miller-Rabin test and the work of Agrawal, Kayal and Saxena, these days people have much much faster algorithms for testing whether $N$ is prime or composite than they do for explicitly finding its factorisation. If you stand at a sufficient distance, the key idea behind both Miller-Rabin and AKS (and every other primality test I've seen) is to work with the ring of residues modulo $N$, and use clever tricks to see whether it has the algebraic properties that it would have if $N$ were prime. Miller-Rabin looks to see if the roots of $1$ behave how Fermat says they should in that ring; AKS tries to verify a certain polynomial identity in it. Are there any other properties of $N$'s factorisation that can be checked in less time than it takes to actually find that factorisation, using similar ideas? For example, is it reasonable to ask for an algorithm which takes a composite $N$ and says something useful about how many prime factors it has? This question is related to the number of square roots of $1$ in the residue ring, so might conceivably be effectively detectable by some devilishly clever trick. Similarly, the distribution of residue classes of the prime factors modulo small integers is closely related to the number of roots of unity of small orders. Or is it simply the case that, once you know that the ring is not a field, you just have so little control over it that no good trickery is known? I read on a webpage about squarefree integers that no such rapid algorithm is known which tests for repeated prime factors, but that doesn't seem to render the general question invalid (though, if nobody can suggest any positive results in this direction, it would lead us to guess that it's hard, perhaps). 

I have done some computer calculations. Here is another small case. The following arrangement, with 19 icons, is best possible for $n=5$, and is also perfect: Best five-by-five arrangement $URL$ I've had a quick look at $n=6$. I have a perfect arrangement of 27, and an imperfect arrangement achieving 29. I don't know if either is best possible yet. 

The quarter-squares are defined by $Q(a) = \lfloor a/2\rfloor\lceil a/2\rceil$. So $Q(2a) = a^2$. First, write every number as a sum of four squares. We can assume they're not all the same (by induction: if this is a problem, the sum is a multiple of 4; we can produce a better representation by representing n/4 as a sum of four squares not all the same and multiplying everything by $2^2$). Now, if two or three are the same, then replace two using the identity $a^2 + a^2 = Q(2a+1) + Q(2a-1)$. The only situation where this fails is where our expression is of the form $a^2 + a^2 + (a+1)^2 + (a+1)^2$ (since we'd use $Q(2a+1)$ twice). But this is $4a^2 + 4a + 2$, which is $(2a+1)^2 + 1^2$, so we have an alternative here too. PS. I notice that Emil has suggested an alternative way of dealing with repeats, while this was being edited into existence. 

This property is closed under taking products of groups, which gives you other examples. Also, any genus $g$ surface (for $g>0$) is a $K(G,1)$, and hence a $BG$, and is clearly a finite CW complex.
