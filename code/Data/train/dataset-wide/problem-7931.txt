Potentially, one way to proceed is to multiply out the product and use the symmetry about $1/2$ to obtain $$S(X)=-\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{q\leq X}\sum_{(a,q)=1}\left(\frac{aa^{*}}{q^2}-\frac{1}{4}\right).$$ Using the fact that $aa^{*}-k(a)q=1$, where $k(a)$ is the greatest number of integer multiples of $q$ less than $aa^{*}$, and $k(a)/q$ is another non-trivial Farey fraction, one obtains $$S(X)=-\frac{1}{2}+\sum_{q\leq X}\sum_{(a,q)=1}\left(\frac{k(a)}{q}-\frac{1}{4}\right) +O(\log X).$$ However, the mapping $a\rightarrow k(a)$ is not an automorphism of the multiplicative group of integers modulo $q$, and the behaviour of $k$ seems to be quite complex. 

It is not clear to me what the level of difficulty of this problem is but it appears to involve questions about notions of randomness in number theory, and so it seems like a reasonable MO question. The motivation here comes from considering the Dirichlet series $$\sum_1^{\infty}\frac{d(n)}{n^s}\sum_{q|n-1:q\leq X}1,$$ and looking at the value of (the analytic continuation of-) this function at $s=0$. Such Dirichlet series are related to questions about the autocorrelation of the divisor function, for which the asymptotics were worked out by Ingham and Estermann in the 1920's and 1930's. The objective is to obtain an asymptotic formula for the sum $$S(X)=\sum_{q\leq X}\frac{1}{\phi(q)}\sum_{\chi}L^2(0,\chi),$$ and it can easily be shown that determining this is equivalent to knowing something interesting about Farey fractions. It is fairly elementary that \begin{eqnarray}\label{} S(X)=\sum_{q\leq X}\frac{1}{\phi(q)}\sum_{\chi} \left( \sum_{a\leq q} \chi(a)\zeta\left(0 ,\frac{a}{q}\right) \right)^2 \end{eqnarray} where $\zeta(s,a)$ is the Hurwitz zeta function so, denoting by $a^*$ the multiplicative inverse of $a$ modulo $q$, expanding out the square and using the orthogonality relations for the Dirichlet characters one obtains $$S(X)=\sum_{q\leq X}\sum_{(a,q)=1}\left(\frac{a}{q}-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{a^*}{q}-\frac{1}{2}\right).$$ Noting that the mean value of the non-trivial Farey fractions ($0$ and $1$ being trivial) is $1/2$ for all $X$, at this point one probably realises that $S(X)/X^2$ is proportional (by a factor of $3/\pi^2$) to the correlation of the non-trivial Farey fractions of order $X$ with their multiplicative inverses modulo their denominators. Since one would expect the values of $a/q$ and $a^*/q$ to be independent as $q\rightarrow\infty$, one would expect that $$S(X)=O(X^{1+\epsilon})$$ and so I would like to pose the following question: 

I just want to point out that there is a nice formula for the coefficients of complex powers of Dirichlet series with completely multiplicative coefficients. You only need to use the binomial series, as follows. If: $$F(s)=\prod_p\left(1-f(p)p^{-s}\right)^{-1}$$ then formally we can define $$F^{z}(s)=\prod_p\left(1-f(p)p^{-s}\right)^{-z},$$ where obviously the usual rules for defining the complex logarithm apply. Multiplying this out gives $$F^{z}(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{f(n)\lambda(n)\prod_{i=1}^{k}{{-z}\choose{\alpha_i}}}{n^s},$$ where $n=\prod_{i=1}^{k}p_i^{\alpha_i}$ is the canonical factorization of $n$. 

Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are correlated random variables in a finite set ${\mathcal A}$, and let $f, g$ be functions that map elements from ${\mathcal A}$ to ${\mathcal B}$ for some finite set ${\mathcal B}$. Assume the following: 

I have a couple of inequalities that I want to prove. The proof is easy using fourier analysis but I am wondering whether there is a proof that does not use fourier analysis. 1) For any $c, s > 0$, $$ \sum_{x \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-\pi x^2 s^2} \ge \sum_{x \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-\pi (x - c)^2 s^2}\;. $$ 2) For any $c,s >0$, $$ \sum_{x \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{-\pi x^2 s^2} \cos(2\pi xc) > 0\;. $$ Can someone suggest some other simple proof? In particular, for the second inequality, is it possible to partition the sum into parts each containing finitely many terms and each is individually greater than $0$. 

Subbarao, M. "Addition chains-some results and problems." Number theory and applications (1989): 555-574. A slightly outdated reference, but seems like the best available for the problem. 

Can we say that there exist independent variables $A, B, C$ and functions $h_1, h_2$ such that the joint distribution of f(X), g(Y), X, Y is same as $A$, $B$, $h_1(A, C)$ and $h_2(B, C)$? The intuition behind the claim is that conditioned on $f(X)$ and $g(Y)$, the joint distribution of $X, Y$ should be such that $X$ depends only on $f(X)$, and $Y$ depends only on $g(Y)$. The marginal distribution of one of $X$ or $Y$ conditioned on $f(X)$ and $g(Y)$ of course satisfies this property by the given independence assumptions. The question is whether we can show such a statement for the joint distribution.. If not, then is there a counter-example? Of course, coming up with a counter-example might be hard since one needs to show that it is not true for any choice $A, B, C$, $h_1$ and $h_2$, but maybe there is some intuitive reasoning why this is not true.. 

Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n, Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_n$ be independent binary random variables each being $1$ with probability $\frac{1}{k}$. Let $Z = X_1(Y_1 + \cdots + Y_k) + X_2(Y_2 + \cdots + Y_{k+1}) + \cdots + X_n(Y_n + Y_1 + \cdots + Y_{k-1})$. It is easy to see that the expected value of $Z$ is $\mu = \frac{n}{k}$. Can someone suggest the best possible bound one can obtain for the probability $\Pr[Z \ge (1+\varepsilon) \mu]$? The setting I am interested in where $n$ is large, and $k \approx \sqrt{n}$. 

If you've investigated the error in Perron's formula in general, you've probably noticed that Cesaro summation $$\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{n\leq x} \left(1-\frac{\log n}{\log x}\right)\frac{a_n}{n^s}$$ sometimes works on the abscissa of convergence of the ordinary Dirichlet series. Let $\rho=\beta+i\gamma$ denote non-trivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$. By truncating the integral representation and estimating the tail, one can prove that for $\sigma\geq \sup \beta $ we have $$\sum_{n\leq x} \left(1-\frac{\log n}{\log x}\right)\frac{\Lambda(n)-1}{n^s}=-\frac{\zeta'(s)}{\zeta(s)}-\zeta(s)+O\left(\frac{1}{\log x}\right)$$ except when $s=\rho$, at which points the sum diverges like $\log x$. I have seen some graphs of the partial sums when $s=1/2+it$ compared with $$-\frac{\zeta'(1/2+it)}{\zeta(1/2+it)}-\zeta(1/2+it)$$ and the results are quite compelling. However, if the Riemann hypothesis is false, divergent terms of modulus $$\frac{x^{\beta-1/2}}{\log x |\gamma-t|}$$ must be added for every zero with $\beta>1/2$, and these will only show up on a graph with sufficiently many terms, or for sufficiently large $t$. Worse still, if there is a conspiracy between the imaginary ordinates of zeros not on the line, these terms may not show up until later. My question is as follows: 

Firstly I am wondering what, exactly, are you trying to count? The Dirichlet coefficients have been given explicitly by GH, so am I to assume this is where you started and now you are looking for another way to estimate the partial sums? Secondly, you cannot integrate the Laurent series termwise so that isn't going to help. My answer to your question merely explains why ``explicit formulae'' are not going to help you in the case $n=1$, which naturally impacts on the higher order cases, and offers an approach to simplifying your problem another way. Formally speaking, your function $I(x)$ has the same relationship to $\lfloor x \rfloor-1$ as Riemann's prime counting function $J(x)$ has to the ordinary prime counting function $\pi (x)$ - they are related by a particular type of Mobius transform, which amounts to taking logarithms of the infinite products comprised of the terms from the original Dirichlet series. You have $$I(x)=\sum_{n\leq \log_2x}\frac{\lfloor x^{1/n} \rfloor-1}{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\log\prod_{n\geq 2}\left(1-\frac{1}{n^s}\right)^{-1}\frac{x^sds}{s}$$ and Riemann had $$J(x)=\sum_{n\leq \log_2x}\frac{\pi(x^{1/n})}{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\log\prod_{p}\left(1-\frac{1}{p^s}\right)^{-1}\frac{x^sds}{s}$$ $$=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\log\zeta(s)\frac{x^sds}{s},$$ where Riemann's ``explicit formula'' is derived by evaluating the integral in terms of the residues at the poles of the integrand, which is where the zeros and pole of $\zeta(s)$ come into play. Now, if you are looking for an explicit formula of the type you mention in your comments above then, by the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, you can write your sum as $$I(x)=\sum _{k\leq \log_2 x}J_k(x)$$ where (1) $$J_k(x)=\sum_{n\leq \log_2x}\frac{\pi_k(x^{1/n})}{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\log\prod_{p_1,p_2,...,p_k}\left(1-\frac{1}{(p_1p_2\cdots p_k)^s}\right)^{-1}\frac{x^sds}{s}$$ and the product runs over all products of $k$ not necessarily distinct primes. Here, $\pi_k(x)$ counts the number of such products whose value is less than $x$. Of course, now you have an even bigger problem: in order to use your explicit formula, you need to know something about the zeros and poles of a whole load of new functions (the integrands in (1)), and establish that Cauchy's theorem can be applied to evaluate each of their inverse Mellin transforms. I hope at this point you can see that invoking the zeros of $\zeta(s)$ and related objects, i.e. involving the primes, is apparently unhelpful here. I think it is a much better idea to follow GH's advice above and work directly with the arithmetic structure that your Dirichlet series encodes. However, I must do this in a second answer because the software is struggling with my latex. 

The standard definition of computability, for a sequence $s\in\{0,1\}^\omega$, is that there is a Turing machine outputting $s[i]$ on input $i$. I'm looking for strengthenings of this notion; for example, in the above definition it's not decidable whether there is a $1$ in $s$; or, given $i$, whether there is a $1$ in $s$ at position $\ge i$. I would be happy to be shown a "natural" definition of computability that makes these predicates computable. To the above: if there were an algorithm that, from the Turing machine producing $s$, tells us whether $s$ contains a $1$ then I could do the following: from any Turing machine $M$, program a Turing machine outputting $s[i]=1$ if $M$ stops after $\le i$ steps. This sequence $s$ is obviously computable --- I said how to compute it --- but an algorithm determining if the sequence contains a $1$ would solve the Halting problem. A search through the literature didn't show anything, so links and references are most welcome! 

I recall having read, some time ago, a beautiful and poetic opening of an article (or was it a book?). From memory, it was by Shigefumi Mori, and talked about the (mathematical) universe consisting of two hemispheres, a real and a p-adic; somehow meeting at the equator. We mere humans should strive to contemplate both sides and their connections. I have tried to locate the precise reference of this text, including some of Mori's papers, but failed. In fact, I'm not anymore sure it was Mori. Does some kind soul know which reference I'm trying to recall? 

Consider a subgroup $L\le(\mathbb Z/2)^n$, or equivalently a family of subsets of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ closed under symmetric difference. I would like an algorithm that gives me a basis of $L$ whose vectors have as small overlaps as possible in their support; equivalently, a generating family of subsets with as small intersections as possible. Presumably, the sets corresponding to the basis will themselves again be as small as possible. The same question can be asked for a subgroup $L\le\mathbb Z^n$. I suspect the problem "Can one find a generating family of $L$ with intersections of size at most $k$?" is NP-complete, so relaxations are welcome. I tried $LLL$-reducing the integer basis, but the result is far from optimal. I get better results by $LLL$-reducing, randomly permuting the vectors, and repeating; but this is again doesn't seem to give very good results. I also tried to start with a basis, and applying elementary transformations "$v_i\leftarrow v_i\pm v_j$" to it so as to reduce intersection sizes. This seems to lead to local minima which are not very good. The parameters I am interested in are $n$ in the thousands, and $L$ of dimension about $n/2$.
