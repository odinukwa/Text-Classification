This seems like a weak case. I'm sure there's a much more thorough rebuttal in the literature, but I'll give at least a few contrary remarks. The second point, that some words in the two languages seem to have some sounds in common, is the most frequent unscientific argument presented in linguistics circles for the existence of a language family. The problem is that between any two sufficiently large sets of data (language vocabularies have thousands of items), there will nearly always be a couple dozen pairs of words that can be extracted that are "similar enough" to be cognates. But that isn't how sound change works - to demonstrate shared ancestry, you must reconstruct words of the common ancestor language, and give a series of regular sound changes that output words in the daughter languages - Grimm's law is a model example of this. The late Basque linguist Larry Trask gave a quite readable defense against the ceaseless proposals attempting to connect Basque, a language isolate, with nearly every other language family, in "Origin and Relatives of the Basque Language" (1995), which I highly recommend for its applicability to this case. I also fail to see how a Proto-Semitic influence would have induced PIE to replace *[k] and *[t] with *[x] and *[θ] when both languages had *[k] and *[t]. Furthermore, PS doesn't even have an *[f] sound, so PIE could not have borrowed it. (You gave *[h], instead of *[x], as the reflex of PIE *[k] - this was a later development in English). Proto-Indo-European had only two tenses, present and past, on verbs in the imperfective aspect. Tense on other verbs was unmarked. The rich tense systems of its descendants are modern innovations. "Ablaut" refers to a morphological alternation already present in PIE - you're thinking of Germanic umlaut, a process which is uncontroversially understood as the product of fronting a stem vowel before a suffix containing [i] (the suffix is later dropped). A substrate influence is not needed to explain this. That being said, you're right that the loss of complexity in the case marking system and the large number of words unique to Proto-Germanic may indicate a pre-IE linguistic substrate. Unfortunately, barring a revolutionary discovery of a new trove of data, we will most likely never know. 

My standard reference manual has always been Hans Krahe's "Germanische Sprachwissenschaft" from 1967. There's a later edition by Wolfgang Meid from 1969, but it is as far as I can see just a photographic reprint that Meid put his name on. Apart from that I'd recommend Streitberg's "Urgermanische Grammatik" from 1896 and Hermann Hirt's "Handbuch des Urgermanischen" from 1931-1934. 

The answer is no. A palatalized /g/ is a different phoneme from a labialized /g/, and there is no obvious way that they are connected. 

This is an old problem within comparative Germanic linguistics. The main ideas out there have been: (1) Only Gothic has both þl- and fl-. The other Germanic languages must therefore have undergone a sound change þl- > fl-. (2) Gothic underwent a sound change fl- > þl-. The Gothic words with fl- are newer loanwords (or other ad hoc solutions). (3) Gothic underwent a conditional sound change fl- > þl-, but it's not clear what the condition was. It's not clear to me whether there is any consensus in the field here, to the extent that this topic has been sufficiently treated to allow a consensus to arise at all. 

The consensus is that Grimm's law occurs before Verner's law. You will in the field of Indo-European linguistics always find someone who claims the opposite of what the consensus says. So it's important to know what the consensus is. Here's an argument in favor of the traditional approach: Verner's law turns voiceless fricatives into voiced fricatives. You can read more about that in my 2011 paper "The phonetics and phonologization of Verner’s law". But, Verner's law also targets Proto-Indo-European */k/. How is that possible? Well, Grimm's law turns Proto-Indo-European */k/ into a voiceless fricative */χ/, so if we order Grimm's law before Verner's law, then the outcome follows: */k/ > */χ/ > */ɣ/. You can read more about that in my 2009 paper "The development of voiced labiovelars in Germanic". My papers are here: $URL$ I would like to know how those people who order these laws differently will explain these facts. 

Theory 2: in in [1] is the result of an ellipsis of an into phrase Under this theory, the sentences in [1] are ellipted versions of something like [2] a. Almost a̲ ̲m̲o̲n̲t̲h̲ ̲i̲n̲t̲o̲ ̲h̲i̲s̲ ̲t̲o̲u̲r̲ ̲o̲f̲ ̲d̲u̲t̲y̲, he was still looking for anything he could relate to.      b. My bf wanted me to quit a̲ ̲m̲o̲n̲t̲h̲ ̲i̲n̲t̲o̲ ̲t̲h̲i̲s̲ ̲j̲o̲b̲ without another job. The reason why in [2] we have into is that the NP that follows would have been in the accusative (in the days when English had a well-developed case system). The OED explains it as follows in its entry for the preposition in: 

Consider the phrase a month in in the following sentences: [1] a. Richmond turned nineteen his third week in Vietnam. A̲l̲m̲o̲s̲t̲ ̲a̲ ̲m̲o̲n̲t̲h̲ ̲i̲n̲, he was          still looking for anything he could relate to. (source)      b. Honestly it's just been a nightmare from the beginning. My bf wanted me to quit          a̲ ̲m̲o̲n̲t̲h̲ ̲i̲n̲ without another job. (source) How should this in be analyzed? I have been unable to find an answer in any of my usual sources. To begin with, the OED does not record this usage of in anywhere in any of its entries for that word. Neither do any of the three comprehensive grammars I usually look at (CGEL, ComGEL, and Longman). Absent an explicit treatment by sources known to me, two theories would seem to suggest themselves. Which, if any, is right? (This question is inspired by this question over on ELU StackExchange, and these two theories came up during discussions with others at ELU.) Theory 1: in in [1] is the same as ago and on in [18] below Consider the following passage from CGEL (p. 632), noting the similarity between [1] above and [18] in the passage. A disclaimer: the thrust of this part of my question is not on whether CGEL has correctly analyzed [18]. For example, maybe ago in [18] a isn't a preposition after all. My primary question, actually, is whether in in [1] and on in [18] b are both instances of the 'same thing', i.e. whether they should both be analyzed the same way, whatever way that is. (Having said that, if you think they can be analyzed in the same way, but think that ago in [18] cannot, I would be interested to hear why.) 

Yes, Basque (in the batua dialect) has ala "or (exclusive)" and edo "or (inclusive)", although ala can only be used in questions. You may also be interested in the WALS maps of languages with an Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Independent Pronouns and an Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Verbal Inflection. 

According to Twitter's new Terms of Service (see paragraph (I)(4)(A)), you may not export any data retrieved from Twitter, whether through its public API or by scraping. So you will probably never find a readily-available corpus of tweets - and if you do, it's in violation. Twitter has already taken a lot of flak for essentially shutting down academic research into a whole new frontier of linguistic data. However, if you'd like to publish your results after analysis, you may provide a database of tweet IDs and usernames, which other researchers can cross-reference with the official Twitter archive. I'd recommend the Streaming API to start aggregating data. 

A diphthong is one sound segment created by a smooth transition between two targets within the same syllable. As a phonetic definition, this makes no theoretical claims about which phoneme(s) represent the articulation in the mind of the speaker. This statement is a bit vague, but is, as far as I can tell, true in some situations; see below. The number and character of underlying phonemes that a diphthong corresponds to varies by language and which researcher you talk to. Different kinds of evidence for a particular interpretation of field data are evaluated differently by each specialists, and mainstream phonology has yet to produce a theoretical framework that gives one clear answer to this question for each language. In English, for example, the diphthong [e͡ɪ] could be represented underlyingly as either the single phoneme /e͡ɪ/ or a sequence of two phonemes /ej/, where /j/ is the same segment that appears in /jɛs/ "yes". The latter analysis is tempting, since it would reduce the size of the phonemic inventory (all possible underlying segments) of English, but would have to explain the phonetic differences between the /j/ in "yes" and the /j/ in "made", which is much more like an [ɪ]. Of course, the addition of a transformation rule would be standard practice when faced with this situation, but we are then left with the basic question of which is simpler (and thus, more likely to be adopted as a strategy by native speakers): fewer phonemes, or fewer rules? 

Discussion One reason to why in might be different from ago and on is that the phrases in [18] could not have come about as ellipses of anything. On the other hand, it seems that one can repeat everything in [29] above for in (literally just replace ago by in). True, all that shows is that in is a preposition in that phrase; but if ago and on can function like this, why couldn't in? Why postulate an ellipsis? So, to repeat: how to analyze the in in [1]? Is either of my theories correct? 

From the discussion of (a) above, it is clear that our sentences do not satisfy (d), either. But doesn't the above then show that Theory 2 is definitely wrong? Well, not quite. ComGEL also says the following: 

As I mentioned, our case will fail to satisfy this unless we change in into into. But that already means we are not dealing with a typical ellipsis. 

This is not satisfied in my case—it is in fact not completely clear what words are omitted (is it really 'his tour of duty'? Are we sure it isn't e.g. 'his service'?). 

So then the idea is that the ellipsis of expressions like those in [2] into those like those in [1] perhaps happened before the accusative got lost and got compensated by changing in into into. Alternatively, perhaps when the ellipsis of [2] happens, we would be left with into on his own, which is not acceptable, and so is shortened into in (which is what it was in the first place, while NPs still all had cases). Some reasons to think that it is not a case of ellipsis A. It is not listed as an example of ellipsis in either ComGEL or CGEL, even though they list a lot of types of ellipsis. B. It really doesn't fit all that well the criteria for ellipsis given in ComGEL (pp. 883-888). Let's consider some of these criteria: 

There's no need to invoke ordered rules in order to explain the vowel distinction between 'writer' and 'rider'. In both cases, the vowel is simply the same as in the non-derived forms 'write' and 'ride', where the distinction between /t/ and /d/ is still present, and it's this distinction between /t/ and /d/ that's responsible for the difference in the articulation of the /ai/ diphthong. The reason you can't detect any difference between the vowels in 'matter' and 'madder' is that these two words aren't derived from base forms where a /t/ and /d/ is present. You're actually being tricked by knowing their spelling. If you didn't, you wouldn't have any idea that one was spelled with 't' and the other with 'd', since these consonants are in fact always pronounced the same (as a flapped [ɾ]). This explains the lack of vowel differences in 'liter' vs. 'leader'. The word 'liter' isn't derived from a base with 't'. The word has a flap [ɾ], which is voiced, and vowels are lengthened before voiced consonants. Since both 'liter' and 'leader' (derived from 'lead') have the vowel before a voiced consonant, their vowels are the same. So what about 'sighter' vs 'cider'? Here you would expect the diphthong in 'cider' to behave like it does before other voiced consonants, since it has a voiced [ɾ]. As musicallinguist says in his answer, the 'Canadian raising' phenomenon typically affects /ai/ before voiceless consonants, but it actually affects some words where /ai/ is before voiced consonants as well. One of the words musicallinguist mentions that he has Canadian raising in is indeed 'cider', and I can verify that (not as a native speaker, but I have definitely heard people pronounce it like that). Other words where you have an 'unexpected' raised /ai/ include words like 'tiger'. I don't know if anyone has a good explanation for these exceptions. In 'slighter' vs. 'slider', you find a contrast in the vowels because they behave "normally", i.e. just like 'writer' vs. 'rider' (since they're derived from 'slight' and 'slide').
