This is essentially a comment on user2097's excellent answer. One consequence of that answer was the construction of a graph with four non-isomorphic edges whose removals result in isomorphic graphs. The graph so constructed had 96 nodes and 293 edges. Without changing the idea of their construction, various tricks allow an improvement to a graph with the same property with 24 nodes and 47 edges. The tricks used are:

This is likely to be difficult. One feature of $As$ that makes it possible for an explicit small minimal model is a simple generators and relations picture; that is, there is one generator $\mu$ and one relation, which is quadratic in the generators. Of course, there are infinitely many colors, but that would be no big deal if the generators and relations were "locally small" in some sense. That is, if your operad were generated by operations like this: 

Consider the nondecreasing vector $v=(1,1,\ldots,1)$. It's not too hard to show that two nondecreasing nonzero vectors orthogonal to $v$ must have a positive inner product. Here is a proof. Let $a=(a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ and $b=(b_1,\ldots, b_n)$ be orthogonal to $v$. Suppose that $a_j$ is the last negative entry of $a$ and $b_k$ is the last negative entry of $b$, for $k>j$. Then \begin{equation}\sum_{i=1}^j |a_ib_i| \ge \sum_{i=1}^j |a_i b_{j+1}| \ge \sum_{i=j+1}^k |a_ib_{j+1}|\ge \sum_{i=j+1}^k |a_ib_i|\end{equation} But the sum defining the inner product is \begin{equation}\sum_{i=1}^j |a_ib_i| - \sum_{i=j+1}^k |a_ib_i| + \sum_{i=k+1}^n |a_ib_i|\end{equation} So this is nonzero as long as $a_n$ and $b_n$ are nonzero; since $a$ and $b$ are orthogonal to $v$, $a_n$ is zero if and only if $a$ is zero, and likewise for $b.$ Now, a generic nondecreasing vector is of the form $av+u$ for $u$ nondecreasing and orthogonal to $v$. Assume we have three mutually orthogonal nonzero nondecreasing vectors $v_i= a_i v +u_i$ for $i\in\{1,2,3\}$. No more than one $u_i$ can be zero; suppose $u_1$ and $u_2$ are nonzero. Then $a_1$ and $a_2$ must have opposite signs for $v_1$ and $v_2$ to be orthogonal (in particular, neither can be zero). Now $u_3$ cannot be zero because then $v_3$ would not be orthogonal to $v_1$ or $v_2$. Then by the same argument, $a_3$ must have a sign opposite to both $a_1$ and $a_2$, a contradiction. 

Background: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $X \subset \mathbb{F}^n$ be an affine variety. Let $\pi(X)$ be the projection of $X$ to the first $m < n$ coordinates, $$ \pi(X) = \{(x_1,\ldots,x_m): x \in X\}, $$ and for a point $a \in \mathbb{F}^m$ let $\phi(a,X)$ be the fiber of $X$ over $a$, $$ \phi(a,X) = \{x \in X: x_1=a_1,\ldots,x_m=a_m\}. $$ It is known that $\dim(\pi(X)) + \dim(\phi(a,X)) \ge \dim(X)$ for all points $a$, and that equality holds for all $a \in U$ where $U \subset \mathbb{F}^m$ is a Zariski open set (so, dimension equality holds for "typical" fibers). Question: Are "a-typical" fibers, where the dimension equality doesn't hold, have lower degree than $X$? That is, for all fibers we have that $\deg(\phi(a,X)) \le \deg(X)$ since they are the intersection of $X$ with the degree $1$ variety given by $x_1=a_1,\ldots,x_m=a_m$. Can it be that when $\dim(\pi(X))+\dim(\phi(a,X))>\dim(X)$ it implies that $\deg(\phi(a,X))<\deg(X)$? Example: Let $X$ be defined by $x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_4=0$. Then $\dim(X)=3,\deg(X)=2$. The projection of $X$ to the first $2$ coordinates $x_1,x_2$ has dimension $2$. Fibers over $(a_1,a_2)$ if $(a_1,a_2) \ne (0,0)$ have as expected dimension $3-2=1$. However, the fiber over $(0,0)$ has dimension $2$ (which is $>1$) but degree $1$ (which is $<2$). 

Is there a finite dimensional subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex that also computes the cohomology of $M$? 

The (finite dimensional) Morse complex obtained from $f_\epsilon$ clearly is not a subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex. If there is in question one no finite dimensional subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex that computes the cohomology of $M$, then the Morse complex of $f_\epsilon$ may be viewed as a finite dimensional substitute. However, it maybe rather arbitrary, since it depends on the choice of $f_i$. Also, the dimensions of this complex maybe quite large, for instance, $f_i$ may have more critical points than the sum of the Betti numbers of $C_i$. That is, $f_i$ may not be a perfect Morse function. If the Morse complex of $f_\epsilon$ is a substitute, then how to choose a good one? Or are there other ways to construct a finite dimensional "Morse-Bott" complex that computes the cohomology of $M$? 

In the paper Morse-Bott theory and equivariant cohomology, Austin and Braam built the Morse-Bott (geometric) complex which computes the de Rham cohomology of the manifold $M$ (this paper can be found in the Floer Memorial Volume). This is a generalization of the Morse complex in the case of a Morse-Bott function $f$ on $M$. However, unlike the Morse complex, the Morse-Bott complex is an infinite dimensional complex. The chains of the Morse-Bott complex are differential forms on the critical submanifolds of $f$ and the boundary map is defined in terms of the flow lines of the gradient vector fields. Only when $f$ is Morse is the complex finite dimensional. I have three related questions: 

We can reformulate the problem as follows: given vectors $u_1,\ldots,u_n,v_1,\ldots,v_n \in \mathbb{R}^m$, find $\max | \langle u_i,v_j \rangle |$ over all $i,j \in [n]$. Now, if an approximate answer is good enough, I think that for small $m$ an approximate answer with multiplicative error of $1+\epsilon$ can be found in time $\approx n m + (1/\epsilon)^m$. Take an $\epsilon$-net of the $m$-dimensional sphere (that is, a set of points on the sphere such that each other point on the sphere is $\epsilon$-close to one of them). Such a net has size $ (1/\epsilon)^{O(m)}$. Now, hash the vectors $u_1,\ldots,u_n$ to the sphere. Let $u'_i=u_i / \|u_i\|$ be the image of $u_i$. Find the point on the net closest to $u'_i$ (trivially this can be done in time linear in the size of the net, but probably there are some geometric algorithms to do this is constant or near constant time). For each point in the net store the vector close to it with maximal norm. Do the same for $v_1,\ldots,v_n$. To finish, go over all pairs of points in the net and compute the inner products of their associated vectors. 

Hi, I am looking for a software package that will allow me to experiment with the irreducible representations of lie groups (for example, $SL(2,p)$) over the complex field and over finite fields. That is, I would like to get the corresponding matrices for group elements. Thanks, Shachar 

Novikov complex is an extension of Morse theory to (closed) Morse 1-form $\omega$, which is not necessarily exact. Suppose for simplicity, $\omega$ is in the integer cohomology class and the universal covering is infinite cyclic. Then $\omega$ can be lifted to the universal cover $\hat M$, i.e., $\pi^\star \omega=d\hat f$, for some Morse function $\hat f$ on $\hat M$. The Morse 1-form $\omega$ generalizes the Morse function and the zeros of $\omega$ take the place of the critical points of a Morse function. Indices of the zeros (or critical points) of $\omega$ can be defined similarly and we have the stable and unstable manifolds of a critical point. The incidence number between a pair of critical points respectively of index $k$ and $k-1$ of $\omega$ can be defined for a Morse-Smale pair $(\omega, g)$, where $g$ is a Riemann metric on $M$. One can lift the stable and unstable manifolds to $\hat M$ and define the corresponding incidence number in $\hat M$ similarly. One can also define the Novikov complex. My question is: $\hat M$ is not compact and the unstable manifold (or the descending disc) of a critical point in $\hat M$ in general goes infinitely downwards. Also, for fixed $x$ in $\hat M$, it is possible that the incidence numbers between the critical points $x$ of index $k$ and $y$ of index $k-1$ in $\hat M$ are non-zero for infinitely many $y$. These are different from Morse theory on compact manifolds. Can someone give a (simple) example of an unstable manifold in $\hat M$ going infinitely downwards for some Morse 1-form? Maybe also an example of infinite number of non-zero incidence numbers? I am sorry that I pose the question rather imprecisely.
