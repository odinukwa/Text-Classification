Here are some more details. Let $A$ be the connected, simply connected Lie group associated with the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{a}$. The inclusion map $\mathfrak{a}\to \mathfrak{gl}_d(\mathbb{R})$ gives rise to a continuous homomorphism $A\to \text{GL}_d(\mathbb{R})$. The connected group alluded to in the (edited) question is the image of $A$ under this continuous homomorphism. Thus we need to show that for every linear representation of a connected Lie group, the associated projective action has a closed orbit. It is enough to show that a cocompact subgroup of $A$ has a closed orbit, as a cocompact subgroup (the stabilizer of a point in this orbit) of a cocompact subgroup is cocompact. Now, use the fact that every connected Lie group has a cocompact solvable subgroup. This is a standard fact (by factoring the solvable radical it is enough to observe this fact for adjoint semi-simple Lie groups, which are in fact real algebraic groups, then it is reduced to Borel's fixed point theorem, which is nothing but the "Zariski closed version of this question" which you seem to be aware of). We thus need to prove the claim: for every linear representation of a connected solvable group, the associated projective action has a closed orbit. Obviously, it is enough to assume the representation is irreducible. We thus need to prove the claim: for every continuous irreducible finite dimensional real linear representation of a connected solvable group $A$, the associated projective action has a closed orbit. Irreducible representations of solvable groups are either one or two dimensional. This follows for example from Lie-Kolchin (for an invariant line $\mathbb{C}\cdot v$ in the complexification, take the space generated by $v+\bar{v}$ and $v-\bar{v}$). In the 1-dim case the corresponding projective space is a singleton, and there is nothing to prove. in the 2-dim case the projective space is a topologically a circle. We are done by noting that the action of a connected group on a circle is either transitive or have a fixed point. Indeed, its orbits are homogeneous connected subsets, thus points or open intervals, and in the latter case any end point of the interval will be fixed. 

However, the following answers positively the case $X=G/K$ where $G$ is locally compact and $K<G$ a compact subgroup. Base: Fix a non constant function in $L^2(G/K)$ and pull it back to a right-$K$-invariant function in $L^2(G)$. Let $K_1$ be the stabilizer of this function wrt the right $G$ action. Thus $K<K_1<G$. By the fact that the function is in $L^2(G)$, $K_1$ is compact. The Hilbert metric of $L^2(G)$ restrict to a metric on the orbit, thus there is a $G$-invariant metric on $G/K_1$. Step: Assume having a compact group $K_\alpha\gneq K$. Fix a non constant function in $L^2(K_\alpha/K)$ and pull it back to $L^2(K_\alpha)$. Let $K_{\alpha+1}$ be the stabilizer of this function wrt the right $K_\alpha$ action. Thus $K<K_{\alpha+1}\lneq K_\alpha$. The Hilbert metric of $L^2(K_\alpha)$ restrict to a metric on the orbit, thus there is a $K_\alpha$-invariant metric on $K_\alpha/K_{\alpha+1}$. Equivalently, there is a $G$-invariant metric on the fibers of $G/K_{\alpha+1}\to G/K_\alpha$. Limit: Having a limit ordinal $\beta$ such that $K_\alpha$ is constructed for every $\alpha\lneq \beta$, define $K_\beta$ to be the closure of $\cup_{\alpha\lneq \beta} K_\alpha$. Termination: With a lot of patient (depending on the cardinality of $G$) you get $\alpha$ such that $K_\alpha=K$. 

Fixing any right invariant metric $D$ on $G=\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{R})$ you get a metric $d$ on $G/\Gamma$ ($\Gamma=\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$) be letting $d(g\Gamma,h\Gamma)=D(g,h\Gamma)$. If $D$ generates the standard topology on $G$ then (as you can check) $d$ will generate the standard topology on $G/\Gamma$. A way to get a right invariant metric on $G$ is by fixing an inner product on its Lie algebra (eg the Hilbert-Schmidt/Frobenius/$L^2$ norm on $M_n(\mathbb{R})$) and right-shifting it around, thus getting a right invariant Riemannian metric. 

Pick naturals $q,m,l,r$. Assume $q$ is a prime power and $2l\leq m$. If $r\leq q^l+1$ then the maximal size of the union of $r$ many $(m-l)$-dimensional sub-vector spaces of $V=\mathbb{F}_q^m$ is $S=rq^{m-l}-(r-1)q^{m-2l}$. If $r\geq q^l+1$ then the size is $q^m$. Note that for $r=q^l+1$ we get $S=q^m$. Since the maximal size of the union is obviously bounded from above by $q^m$ and is non-decreasing as a function of $r$, it is enough then to show that for $r\leq q^l+1$ the maximal size of the union is $S$. Below we do assume $r\leq q^l+1$. Assume having such $r$ subspaces with maximal union size. Since the intersection of each two has dimension bounded from below by $m-2l$, the size of the intersection is bounded from above by $S$ and this is obtained iff they all have a common intersection of dimension $m-2l$. In this case we may pass to the quotient space obtained by moding up this subspace, thus reduce to the special case $m=2l$ which is dealt by the following Lemma: The maximal size of a collection of pairwise trivially intersecting $l$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb{F}_q^{2l}$ is $q^l+1$. An example of $q^l+1$ many such subspace is obtained by considerng the collection of lines inside a 2-dimensional space over $\mathbb{F}_{q^l}$. On the other hand, if we have $s$ such subspaces and $s>q^l+1$ then the size of their union is $sq^l-(s-1)>q^{2l}$, which is an absurd. 

Observe that $\nu'$ represents an invariant function on $\Gamma$ taking the value $1$ at the identity, thus the constant function $1$. Assuming $\partial^{\text{min}}_M\Gamma=\overline{\partial^{\text{min}}_M\Gamma}$ we will get $\nu'=\nu$ by the uniqueness of the presentation, 1. But by 4, $\nu\neq\nu'$. Therefor $\partial^{\text{min}}_M\Gamma\neq\overline{\partial^{\text{min}}_M\Gamma}$. 

Here is how to build examples where $\partial^{\text{min}}_M\Gamma$ is a proper subset of its closure. First note the following two facts: 

No. Let $A=C([0,1])$ and $B=\{f\mid f(0)=0\}$. $A$ is unital, so it certainly satisfies your condition, but for every $f\neq 0$, $fB\neq \{0\}$. 

You ask specifically about the symmetric groups and the free groups. This is a bit funny, as a finite group forms its own proalgebraic completion (a slight generalization of this fact is Proposition 1 in Bass-Lubotzky-Magid-Mozes), while the proalgebraic completion of a non-abelian free group is clearly not a manageable object. Note that it follows that every group which virtually surjects onto a non-abelian free group, e.g a surface group or $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$, has a huge completion. As you mentioned, for f.g abelian groups it should be rather easy to work out the proalgebraic completion. I suppose this is also the case for f.g nilpotent groups: the completion should be the Malcev completion times a protorus times the profinite completion. I would start by thinking explicitly of the Heisenberg group to verify this guess. As mentioned in Ian Agol's comment, Margulis Super-Rigidity provides a powerful tool for computing proalgebraic completions for higher rank arithmetic groups. This is also mentioned in the introduction of BLMM. In particular, when you also have the Congruence Subgroup Property you get very neat results, e.g the proalgebraic completion of $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is $\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{C})\times \text{SL}_n(\hat{\mathbb{Z}})$ for $n\geq 3$. 

I claim that there are many occasions where a sequence $(z_n,e^{z_n})$ with $z_n\to \infty$ is NOT Zariski dense. Take for instance the complex function $f(w)=e^{1/w}-1/w$. It has an essential singularity at 0, so by Picard's great theorem we know that for all but one (maybe) values $c$ there exists a sequence $w_n$ converging to 0 with $f(w_n)=c$. So let's define the polynomial $p(x,y)=y-x-c$ (for a non-stupid choice of $c$) and the sequence $z_n=1/w_n$ (for the corresponding sequence $w_n$). Note that $z_n\to \infty$, $p(z_n,e^{z_n})=0$ and $e^{z_n}=z_n+c$ is not constant. 

To the question in the title: Not in general, e.g the action of (an infinite profinite group) $G$ on itself by left multiplication is continuous with infinite orbits. However, note that the action of a profinite group on a discrete topological space is continuous iff the stabilizers are open (hence of finite index). To the question in the body: It is implicitly assumed that $V$ is taken with the discrete topology. 

Not necessarily. Assuming $x\in C$ is an element with valuation $\sqrt{2}$, $x$ is not contained in any subfield of $C$ which has discrete valuation. 

If my understanding of the question is correct then the answer is "not necessarily". I understand that $\Delta$ is the Bruhat-Tits building of $H=\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, while $G=\text{SL}_n(\mathbb{Q})<H$ is a countable subgroup. In particular, $\mathcal{A}$ is countable. Let $A<H$ be the diagonal subgroup and fix a regular element $\alpha\in A$. The axis of translation of $\alpha$ is contained in the basic apartment $\Sigma$, and only in this apartment, by regularity. Let $N$ be the normalizer of $A$ in $H$. $A<N$ is of finite index ($n!$), and thus the index of $N<H$ is of continuum cardinality. Every element $hN\in H/N$ could be identified with the unique apartment $h\Sigma$ containing the axis of translation of the hyperbolic element $\alpha^h$. Not all could be contained in $\mathcal{A}$ by the cardinality constraint. 

The question seems to be asking whether there exists an injective $L^\infty([0,1])$-module map $(L^\infty([0,1]))^2\to L^2([0,1])$. The answer is "NO". In fact, I claim that every finitely generated submodule of $L^2([0,1])$ is actually generated by a single element and it is isomorphic to $L^\infty([0,1])\cdot\chi_A$ for some measurable $A\subset [0,1]$. This follows from the three claims below. Claim 1: For every $f\in L^2([0,1])$ there exists $\phi_f\in L^\infty[0,1]$ such that $\phi_f f=|f|$. Proof: For $t$ such that $f(t)=0$ define $\phi_f(t)=0$. Otherwise define $\phi_f(t)=\overline{f(t)}/|f(t)|$. Claim 2: Every finitely generated submodule of $L^2([0,1])$ is generated by a single element. Proof: For the module generated by $f_1,\ldots,f_n$ consider the element $f=\sum \phi_{f_i}f$. Claim 3: The module generated by a single element $f$ is isomorphic to $L^\infty([0,1])\cdot\chi_{\{t\mid f(t) \neq 0\}}$. Proof: The kernel of the map $L^\infty([0,1])$ to $L^2([0,1])$ given by $1\mapsto f$ is clearly $L^\infty([0,1])\cdot\chi_{\{t\mid f(t)= 0\}}$. Corollary: There is no injective $L^\infty([0,1])$-module map $\phi: (L^\infty([0,1]))^2\to L^2([0,1])$. Proof: Since the image of $\phi$ is finitely generated it could be injected further into $L^\infty([0,1])$, thus we obtain a map $(L^\infty([0,1]))^2\to L^\infty([0,1])$. We conclude by the fact that for every commutative unital ring $R$, an $R$-module map $\psi:R^2\to R$ cannot be injective: either $\psi=0$ or the nonzero element $(\psi(0,1),-\psi(1,0))$ is in its kernel. Remark: Note that it follows that for every $n\geq 2$, there is no injective $L^\infty([0,1])$-module map $(L^\infty([0,1]))^n\to L^2([0,1])$. 

Consider $X=Y=[-1,1]$ and $\mathcal{O}=(0,1]\subset Y$. Let $\pi_1:Y\to X$ be the identity map. Then for any $\mu\in \text{Prob}(Y)$ we have that $\mu_x=\delta_x$, and the function $x\mapsto \mu_x(\mathcal{O})$ equals $\chi_{\mathcal{O}}$ which is lower semicontinuous, but not upper semi-continuous. Let $\pi_2:Y\to X$ be given by defined by $\pi_2(x)=\min\{x,0\}$. Then for every $\mu\in \text{Prob}(Y)$ the function $x\mapsto \mu_x(\mathcal{O})$ equals $\mu(\mathcal{O})\cdot\delta_0$ and if $\mu(\mathcal{O})>0$ this function is upper semi-continuous but not lower semi-continuous. We conclude that no semi-continuity is guaranteed in general. 

The following argument is short enough so you can actually include it in your paper (I would do that in the following sketchy form, but that is a matter of style). Say that a triple of points is orthogonal if the distance between each pair is $\pi/2$. Consider configurations of four points in $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{R})$ such that the first three form an orthogonal triple and the fourth is equidistant form each point in that triple. Observe that $\text{O}(3)$ acts transitively on the set of such configurations. Observe further that any isometry that fixes the three axis lines and the line $[1,1,1]$ is trivial. Deduce that the isometry group is $\text{O}(3)$. 

As Francois Ziegler answered, for a locally compact group $G$, the Bohr compactification of $G$ is a compactification in the usual sense iff $G$ is compact. This is true with no further restrictions. Recall that the forgetful functor from compact groups to topological groups has a left adjoint functor, denoted here $b$. For any topological group $G$, the identity in $\text{Hom}(bG,bG)$ corresponds to an element of $\text{Hom}(G,bG)$ called the unit, $u:G\to bG$. It is easy to check that $u(G)$ is dense in $bG$ (this is usually seen directly from the construction of $b$, but also follows from the abstract nonsense). The homomorphism $u:G\to bG$ is known as the Bohr compactification of $G$. This terminology is a bit unfortunate, as $u$ is not a compactification in the sense usually used in topology, unless $G$ was compact to begin with (in fact, $u$ is rarely injective - groups for which $u$ is injective are called "maximally almost periodic"). By a "compactification in the usual sense" of a locally compact space $X$ one means a continuous map $f:X\to Y$ where $f(X)$ is dense in $Y$ and $f:X\to f(X)$ is a homeomorphism. In that case $f(X)$ is necessarily open in $Y$ (this an easy exercise). In case $X$ and $Y$ were groups and $f$ a group homomorphism, $f(X)$ was also closed, as any open subgroup is closed, thus $f(X)=Y$ by density. So $X$, being homeomorphic to $Y$, must have been compact to begin with. More generally, let me note that any locally compact subgroup of any topological group is necessarily closed (and if the ambient group is locally compact, a subgroup is locally compact iff it is closed).
