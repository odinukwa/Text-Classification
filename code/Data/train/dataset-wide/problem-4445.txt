I think really it depends if this is a one of trip or if you visit the pitch regularly. A one of trip will do minimum damage all though I'd advise trying to walk over in regular shoes. If you did walk over in studs, they wouldn't wear down enough for a match official to disallow you from playing for example, but there would be some damage. If you go there regularly then I would definitely recommend wearing normal shoes. They will wear down too quickly and become sharp.

I am a goalkeeper and a wicket keeper, and because these are specialist positions they need different drills and equipment to, say, midfielders or bowlers. I have my own drills but I'd like some new ideas and equipment. So any recommendations? Either

4.3 The racket: 4.3.1: [The racket] shall be free of attached objects and protrusions, other than those used solely and specifically to limit or prevent wear and tear, or vibration, or to distribute weight, or to secure the handle by cord to the player's hand, and which are reasonable in size and placement for such purposes 

Watching the Olympics I have found the swimming very interesting. I've noticed that while the swimmers are swimming the TV Channel (BBC) projects a line across the width of the pool saying WR (World Record) at the end. I'm a bit unsure about this line, I know it's to show where the swimmers would need to be at to get the World Record but is the line showing where the swimmer who holds that world record was at that point or is it showing the required place through out? e.g. say the 100m WR was 50 seconds, then the line would progress 10m every 5 seconds.

In international cricket if an umpire gives a batsman not out after an appeal by the fielding side then the captain of the fielding side can review the decision. Scenario: A batsman gets a tiny edge onto his pad and the fielding side appeals for lbw while the ball bounces up to a fielder who catches it. The umpire gives it not out. The captain is unsure whether the batsman has hit it but reviews the lbw anyway. The edge comes up on hot-spot so it can't be lbw. 

ATP Tour Simply by checking List of ATP number 1 ranked singles players at Wikipedia I found two players who were Year-end No. 1 without winning a Grand Slam tournament that year:

NOTE: This cannot be considered as a complete answer, since I wasn't able to find the record for WTA matches and also some sources I found contradict each other. But I am posting at least the information I was able to find, hoping that someone might be able to find the missing info. Open Era records ATP matches Adriano Panatta saved 11 match points in his match against Kim Warwick in the first round of 1976 Italian Open. He won this match and then went on to win the tournament. Several sources confirm this as the Open Era record. 1, 2, 3. 4 WTA matches I found several mentions of Svetlana Kuznetsova defeating Virginia Ruano Pascual and saving 11 match points in Madrid 2001. 1. 2, 3. I did not find any source confirming that this is indeed a record. Grand Slam matches In the open era there were 5 occurrences when a player saved 9 match points and won a match at a Grand Slam tournament. 

Premier League Red cards ar not mentioned in the article Premier League records and statistics. The article Football records in England mentions matches with 6 and 5 red cards, but not from Premier League. I did not find any mention of game with most red cards in the Wikipedia articles Bundesliga records, Football records in Italy, Ligue 1 records.
