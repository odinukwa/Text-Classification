I came across a new type of gluing in the FOOO paper $URL$ (maybe not so new to experts). The situation is as follows: one considers a relative (to lagrangian) class and want to understand the evaluation maps of the moduli space to the lagrangian. An option is to do the original FOOO thing--Kuranishi structure, multisection perturbation and evaluation; however, if there is a separating contact type hypersurface in the manifold, where the lagrangian entirely lies on one of the pieces, there's another option. I can first do neck-stretching in SFT, then evaluate the fiber product of moduli space involving punctures on the two sides, fiber product taken over evaluation on the punctures where the moduli spaces can be glued. My question is: 

I suspect there's another implicit assumption they used but suppressed here, that the evaluation always gives a cycle due to torus action. I do not have a clear idea why the assumption on simple puncture plays a role. The Li-Ruan's paper and settings therein do not seem to be responsible for this assumption. Notice that, in the setting of the above paper, the evaluation should involve a virtual perturbation since the moduli space in question is (a maslov=$2$ disk)+($k$ copies of maslov=$0$ spheres). The following special case should help concretize my question: consider still a toric manifold, where the Kuranishi structure and perturbation seem much easier to construct according to toric FOOO I&II. If one considers a certain contact type hypersurface which is Morse-Bott and invariant under torus action, and an arbitrary classes with maslov=$2$, can one still claim such a gluing result "standard"? 

In dimension $4$ I feel this should be proved, and let me make a fuzzy attempt. In dimension $4$ Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds are all rational or ruled, so except for $\mathbb{C}P^2$ which needs independent check, you may just take an $S^1$-equivariant almost complex structures and consider the self-intersection zero class which is automatically transversal. This gives a fibration where the singular points come from bubblings which should be separated on the base by perturbations. This fibration should be what you want, and the plausibility comes from that if your $S^1$-action comes from transporting the fibers instead of rotating the fibers, then your base needs to rotate, but the singular values prevents you to do so except for some extreme cases where one checks by case study. If this is the only construction in the 4-dimensional case, I feel it very hard to extend to higher dimensions with current techniques. Because if you try to use Donaldson's construction on $4$ dimension, it clearly never give you satisfactory answers because the Donaldson hypersurfaces are usually not spheres, so this line seems not approaching a general argument; while on the other hand, if you give up Donaldson's construction, it is already extremely hard to even just to find a smooth symplectic hypersurface, at least for me personally. 

With Le Pham and White we remove the commutative condition in $URL$ With ten years' of hindsight, I find that I can now improve this result and give an easy proof... A dual Banach algebra is a Banach algebra which is a dual space, in such a way that the multiplication is separately weak$^*$-continuous. Thus the above result says that a von Neumann algebra has a unique weak$^*$-topology making the multiplication map weak$^*$-continuous. If $E$ is a Banach space, then whenever $E$ is isomorphic to $F^*$ for some Banach space $F$, say under $\theta: E \rightarrow F^*$ we can look at the image of $F$ under the adjoint $\theta^*$. This gives a closed subspace of $E^*$, say $X$, such that $E$ is canonically isomorphic to $X^* = E^{**} / X^\perp$, where $X^\perp$ is the annihilator of $X$ in $E^{**}$. This means that: 

The answer for Question 1 is "yes". I believe this to be a little subtle. Firstly, as $j:H\rightarrow G$ is proper and injective, $j(H)$ is closed in $G$, and $j:H\rightarrow j(H)$ is a homeomorphism. So wlog $H$ can be identified with a closed subgroup of $G$, with $j$ the inclusion. You sort of hint at this in the statement of your question. Then, what is your map $J$? Well, if $\varphi\in C_c(H)$ then $f=\varphi\mu_H$ is a member of $L^1(H)$ (and such elements are dense). So $J\lambda_H(f) = \lambda_G(j^*(f))$ where $j^*$ is the pushforward $M(H)\rightarrow M(G)$. A more functional analytic way to think of this is to note that as $j$ is proper, it defines a map $\theta:C_0(G)\rightarrow C_0(H); g\mapsto g\circ j$ (as $H$ is closed, actually this map is a surjection). Then the Banach space adjoint is $j^*:M(H)=C_0(H)^* \rightarrow C_0(G)^*=M(G)$. Now, when does $J$ extend to a normal $*$-homomorphism $W^*_\lambda(H) \rightarrow W^*_\lambda(G)$? I like to think of this in an abstract harmonic analysis framework-- the predual of $W^*_\lambda(G)$, denoted $A(G)$, can be given the structure of a commutative Banach algebra: the "Fourier Algebra" as defined by Eymard. If we regard $\lambda_G$ as a map $L^1(G)\rightarrow W^*_\lambda(G)$ then we can regard $\lambda_G^*$ as a map $A(G)\rightarrow L^1(G)^*=L^\infty(G)$, and then this actually maps into $C_0(G)$ densely (this "is" the Gelfand map of the commutative Banach algebra $A(G)$, suitably interpreted-- if $G$ is abelian, it is the Fourier transform, hence the name). As $J$ is normal, it has a preadjoint $A(G)\rightarrow A(H)$, and if you regard these as non-closed subalgerbas of $C_0(G)$ and $C_0(H)$ respectively, we just get the map $\theta$ described above. So the question becomes equivalent to: does the map $a\mapsto a\circ j$ map $A(G)$ to $A(H)$ boundedly (hence automatically contractively). It turns out that the answer is: "yes". It's even a quotient map-- every $A(H)$ function arises as the restriction of an $A(G)$ function (identifying $H$ as a closed subgroup of $G$). This theorem is known as "Herz restriction", and the nicest writeup I know is an MSc thesis: Cameron Zwarich's thesis, see Section 4.2. Once we know $J$ exists, we know that $J\lambda_H(f)=\lambda_G(j^*(f))$ for all $f\in L^1(H)$, and as $j^*(f)\in M(G)$, it follows that $J\lambda_H(f)\in MC^*_\lambda(G)$, so indeed $J$ does restrict to a map $C^*_\lambda(H) \rightarrow MC^*_\lambda(G)$. The example of $\mathbb Z\subseteq\mathbb R$ shows we can't hope to get into $C^*_\lambda(G)$. Surely the same techniques give a positive answer of Q2. I think $\mathbb R \rightarrow \mathbb R/\mathbb Z=\mathbb T$ shows that Q3 does not have a positive answer in general; I think the Fourier transform shows that $W^*_\lambda(\mathbb R)=L^\infty(\mathbb R), W^*_\lambda(\mathbb T)=\ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)$ and the map $J$ should send $(e^{2\pi ixt})_{x\in\mathbb R}\in L^\infty(\mathbb R)$ to $(e^{2\pi int})_{n\in\mathbb Z}\in\ell^\infty(\mathbb Z)$. This doesn't exist at the $L^\infty$ level. You always have a map at the level of full $C^*$-algebras, $C^*(G)\rightarrow C^*(K)$ (surjective even, and no multiplier algebra) but amenability issues might becomes a problem trying to drop to $C^*_\lambda(K)$. 

Let $P_k$ be the product of the $k$ first prime numbers, and for any integer $n$, we denote by $(d_i)_{1 \leq i \leq \tau(n)}$ the increasing sequence of its divisors. The set $\{n_1, ... n_N \}$ of square-free positive integers which are generated by the first $k$ primes that you are considering is nothing else than the set of the divisors of $P_k$. Thus we can use this notation: $$\delta_k = \min_{\ell_1<\ell_2} \left(\frac{n_{\ell_2}}{n_{\ell_1}} - 1\right) = \min_{\ell} \left(\frac{n_{\ell+1}}{n_\ell} - 1\right) = \min_{d_i | P_k,\ 1 \leq i < 2^k} \left(\frac{d_{i+1}}{d_i} - 1\right).$$ We have, for $ \epsilon > 0$, $$(2^k-1) \Bigg( \min_{d_i | P_k,\ 1 \leq i < 2^k} \left(\frac{d_{i+1}}{d_i} - 1\right)\Bigg)^{1+\epsilon} \leq \sum_{1 \leq i < 2^k} \left(\frac{d_{i+1}}{d_i} - 1\right)^{1+\epsilon} \leq C,$$ with an absolute constant $C$, uniformly for all $k$, by using Théorème 1 of Sur un problème extrémal en arithmétique, G. Tenenbaum, Ann. Inst. Fourier, Grenoble (1987). i.e. it is proved that, for every $\epsilon > 0$, $$\delta_k \ll 2^{-k(1-\epsilon)}$$ Note 1 : It doesn't give the lower bound you were looking for, but it confirms that $\delta_k$ has an upper bound of the order you expected, i.e. $e^{-c\ k}$. Note 2 : I have applied Théorème 1 with the function $h(u) = u^{1+\epsilon}$, but the article describes (see page 3) a wider class of function that could be used. Note 3 : For a lower bound, the best I can prove is (do you want me to post a proof for this?): $$\delta_k \gg e^{- \frac{1}{2} k \log k}$$ 

Let $(B_t)$ be a brownian motion on [0,1]. For the following, let $\omega$ be fixed. Let's compute the total absolute variation when sampling period = $\delta$ is fixed: $$V(\delta) = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} |B_{t_{i+1}}(\omega) - B_{t_i}(\omega)|. $$ (i.e. $0 = t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < ... < t_N = 1$ with a constant step $\delta = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for all $i$) I noticed experimentally that: $$ V(\delta) \sim c\ \delta^{-1/2}$$ It confirms the common-sense feeling that the smaller the sampling period (=the higher the sampling rate), the higher the total absolute variation. Is it a well-known result? If so, where could I find a proof? 

Let $(X_n)$ be a martingale. What can be said about the distribution of its maximum over a window of fixed length: $$M_n = \max_{n-10 \leq k \leq n} X_k$$ or about the "range" over a window: $$R_n = \max_{n-10 \leq k \leq n} X_k - \min_{n-10 \leq k \leq n} X_k $$ I know Doob's inequality, but can we give more precise informations about $M_n$ or $R_n$ ? At least when $X_{n+1} - X_n$ has a normal distribution? 

More generally, if for a process $X_t$ we have $$ V(\delta) \sim c\ \delta^{-\kappa}$$ can we prove that $H = 1 - \kappa$ is the Hurst exponent of $X_t$ ? It seems to work when $X_t$ is a $C^\infty$ function ($H=1$, $\kappa = 0$), it works for Brownian motion ($1/2$ for both), it also works for White noise ($H=0$, $\kappa = 1$). 

This was originally tagged fa.functional analysis, I think. So he's an Operator Algebraic answer. I'm going to make the strong assumption that E is self-adjoint (i.e. closed under taking the hermitian transpose). If not, then really this is an algebraic question, and it's probably irrelevant that you are working with the complex numbers... Anyway, then E is a finite-dimensional von Neumann algebra. The action of E on M_n is the same as identifying M_n with $\mathbb C^n \otimes \mathbb C^n = \ell^2_n \otimes \ell^2_n$ and letting E act as $E \otimes 1$. Then invariant subspaces for $E$ correspond to orthongonal projections in the commutant of E, which by Tomita is $E' \otimes M_n$ where $E' = \{ A\in M_n : AB=BA (B\in E)\}$ the commutant of $E$ in $M_n$. We identify $E'\otimes M_n$ with $M_n(E')$, and then it's just (ahem!) a case of working out the projections (self-adjoint idempotents) here. In concrete cases, this is probably not too hard... 

Let $I$ be a closed ideal of $A(\mathbb T)$. The hull of $I$ is $$ \nu(I) = \{ h\in \mathbb T : f(h)=0 \ (f\in I) \} $$ a closed subset of $\mathbb T$. Conversely, if $N\subseteq\mathbb T$ is a closed subspace then the kernel of $N$ is $$ \iota(N) = \{ f\in A(\mathbb T) : f(h)=0 \ (h\in N) \} $$ a closed ideal in $A(\mathbb T)$. Clearly $I \subseteq \iota(\nu(I))$ but sadly we do not always have equality. We say that an ideal $I$ has spectral synthesis if we have $I = \iota(\nu(I))$. If $G$ is a discrete abelian group then every closed ideal in $A(G)$ has spectral synthesis. If $G$ is a non-discete abelian group, then a theorem of Malliavin shows that there is a closed ideal without spectral synthesis. In conclusion, closed subsets of $\mathbb T$ do not classify closed ideals of $\ell^1(\mathbb Z)$. 

Suppose towards a contradiction that $E$ is not super-reflexive, so there is a non-reflexive $F$ finitely representable in $E$. There is hence a separable subspace $F_0$ of $F$ which is not reflexive. Clearly $F_0$ is still finitely representably in $E$, and so isometric to a subspace of $(E)_{\mc U}$. Hence $(E)_{\mc U}$ is not reflexive, contrary to assumption. We then proceed exactly as Jochen Glueck's comment. Edit: As Tomek points out, if $E$ is separable (with no other condition) and $\mc U$ is countably complete, then $(E)_{\mc U} = E$ canonically. Here's a proof (which I hadn't realised before). That $\mc U$ is countably complete is equivalent to the property that if $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is a sequence in $\mc U$ then also $\cap_n A_n \in \mc U$. Let $\mc U$ be on a set $I$, and let $A_n\subseteq I$ be any sequence of subsets which cover $I$, so $\cup_n A_n = I$. We claim that then some $A_n\in\mc U$. For if not, $I\setminus A_n\in\mc U$ for all $n$ (as $\mc U$ is an ultrafilter) and so $\cap_n (I\setminus A_n) = \emptyset\in\mc U$, contradiction. Let $(x_n)$ be a dense sequence in $E$, and let $(y_i)\in (E)_{\mc U}$. Consider the sets $$ A_{n,m} = \{ i : \|y_i - x_n\| < 1/m \}. $$ As $(x_n)$ is dense, for any fixed $i$ and $m$ there is some $n$ with $\|y_i-x_n\|<1/m$. So $(A_{n,m})$ covers $I$, and so there is some $A_{n,m}\in\mc U$. Fix this $n$ and consider $A_{n,k}\subseteq A_{n,m}$ for $k\geq m$. Repeating the argument finds that there is an increasing sequence $m \leq k_1 < k_2 < k_3 < \cdots$ with $A_{n,k_i}\in\mc U$ for each $i$. Hence $$ \bigcap_i A_{n,k_i} = \{ i : y_i=x_n \} \in\mc U $$ and so $(y_i) = x_n\in E$ in $(E)_{\mc U}$.
