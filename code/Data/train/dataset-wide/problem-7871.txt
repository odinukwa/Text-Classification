Another recent meeting around the new developments by Hairer and others in the strongly related field of stochastic quantization is: 

Who first used the expression "dyadic model" in the sense of this blog post by Terence Tao? Say you are a harmonic analyst trying to prove a result, e.g., something like the Carleson-Hunt Theorem, but it's just too hard. So you consider instead a simplified dyadic model, for instance using Walsh series, you work out this simpler situation and then you adapt your argument to the real McCoy. Q1: What is the history of this methodology in harmonic analysis? Another related but different question: what about, more generally, the history of dyadic analysis? Q2: What were some of the main steps in the historical development of this subject? Note that I mostly care about Q1. As for Q2 it is probably too broad as stated since this could be interpreted as asking about the history of related fields like: renormalization group analysis, multiscale analysis etc. In order to make this more focused I would like to restrict to techniques based on dyadic cubes in harmonic analysis as in these two surveys: $URL$ and $URL$ 

The answer is yes for both situations because mixing implies ergodic. To make things precise, let $S=S(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be the Schwartz space of smooth real valued functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ which decay faster than any negative power of the Euclidean norm. Let $S'$ be the dual space of tempered distributions. For $f\in S$ and $\phi\in S'$ denote by $\phi(f)$ the duality pairing. Let the cylindrical $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{C}$ on $S'$ be the smallest such that $\phi\mapsto \phi(f)$ from $(S',\mathcal{C})$ to $(\mathbb{R}, {\rm Borel\ sets})$ is measurable, for any $f\in S$. I assume the measure $\mu$ you are talking about is the centered Gaussian probability measure on $(S',\mathcal{C})$ with covariance $$ \int_{S'} \phi(f)\phi(g)\ {\rm d}\mu(\phi)= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) g(x) \ {\rm d}^n x\ . $$ Let $x\in\mathbb{R}^n$ we define translation by $x$ by: $(\tau_x f)(y)=f(x-y)$ for test functions, $(\tau_x \phi)(f)=\phi(\tau_{-x} f)$ for distributions, and by $(\tau_x F)(\phi)=F(\tau_{-x}\phi)$ for complex valued $\mathcal{C}$-measurable functionals on $S'$. To show the mixing property, you need to prove that for any such functionals $F$, $G$ in $L^2(S',{\rm d}\mu)$ one has $$ \int_{S'} F(\tau_x \phi) G(\phi)\ {\rm d}\mu(\phi)\rightarrow \left(\int_{S'} F(\phi)\ {\rm d}\mu(\phi)\right) \times\left(\int_{S'} G(\phi)\ {\rm d}\mu(\phi)\right)\ \ \ (\ast) $$ when $x$ goes to infinity. First note that the span $V$ of monomials $\phi(f_1)\cdots \phi(f_n)$ is dense in $L^2(S', {\rm d}\mu)$. That's basically the Wiener-Bargmann-Ito-Segal isomorphism with Fock space. Also note that $||\tau_x F||_2=||F||_2$. So if you approach $F$ with $F_n$ in $V$ the norm of the difference is the same for all translates. So a simple three epsilon argument allows to reduce the proof of $(\ast)$ to the case of monomials. If you evaluate $$ \int_{S'} \phi(\tau_x f_1)\cdots\phi(\tau_x f_n) \phi(g_1)\cdots\phi(g_m) \ {\rm d}\mu(\phi) $$ using the so-called Wick theorem (due in fact to Isserlis) you will see the factors $$ \int_{S'} \phi(\tau_x f_i)\phi(g_j)= \int_{\mathbb{R}^n} f_i(y-x)g_j(y)\ {\rm d}^n y $$ which couple the $f$'s and the $g$'s go to zero. The same proof goes in the mollified case too. The essential ingredient here is that the kernel of the covariance decays fast enough. Also remark that this generalizes to measures which are not Gaussian. One just needs to decompose moments into cumulants aka connected correlation functions. The key input which generalizes the single factor decay between $f_i$ and $g_j$ above is called the clustering property. It is one of the Osterwalder-Schrader axioms in constructive quantum field theory which physically corresponds to the uniqueness of the vacuum. 

As far as references for these things, have a look at this webpage for lecture notes by Martin Hairer. In particular, the lectures on "Ergodic properties of Markov processes" are I think exactly what you need (see discussion around Theorem 4.21 therein). The important property for $\mathcal{X}$ is to be a Polish space. Local compactness is not necessary. 

Update 2: A better "classical" reference (than Klein's of Meyer's) on the above method is the book by Turnbull "The Theory of Determinants, Matrices and Invariants". In Chapter XXI (in the 1960 Edition) he calls such FFT's "Adjunction Theorems", see in particular Sections 10 and 11. 

Edit Jan 11, 2018: One can make a little bit of progress by pushing my initial idea (pair partitions plus round robin) "to second order", i.e., make use of a little bit of cancellation. See further below. 

See these three papers and references therein: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Going from one type of tree to another is no big deal in the framework of Joyal's theory of combinatorial species. Types of trees correspond to certain functors between finite sets and for each such functors there is an associated exponential generating series. Changing from say planar trees to Cayley trees is a morphism of functors and there is a precise theorem which says what happens then to the generating series (Theorem 8 in the last paper I listed). 

For $L=1$ and $L=2$, I can do that which gives me the tetrahedron and the Petersen graph respectively. Does this kind of problem arise in geometric group theory and the study of locally finite graphs? Also, when looking at OEIS A032355, the relevant numbers of vertex-transitive graphs seems abnormally low. Even more surprising, they immediately precede a big surge (look at the values for $n=2,5,11,23,47,95$ in that list). Is there a known explanation for this phenomenon? Edit in view of the awesome answers by Aaron and Gordon: I still have to digest the theory around Moore graphs and bound. My motivation for this question comes from statistical mechanics on the widest possible class of lattices. In particular it has to do with the question of defining "periodic boundary conditions" for given finite subsets. In this regard, an equally useful (for me) weakening of my question is as follows: 

Let $(\mu_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^d}$ be a collection of signed/complex Radon measures on $U\subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Let's call it locally finite if for every compact $K\subset U$, $|\mu_{\alpha}|(K)=0$ except for finitely many multiindices $\alpha$'s. Now given such a collection and for a test function in $f\in \mathcal{D}(U)$ define $$ \phi(f)=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^d} \int_U \partial^{\alpha}f(x) \ d\mu_{\alpha}(x)\ . $$ This $\phi$ is in $\mathcal{D}'(U)$ and I am pretty sure every element on $\mathcal{D}$ looks like this. The writing is of course very non unique because of the redundancy between derivatives of the same function. This is just an elaboration on Isset's answer. I think it is nice to think of all these "layers" index by $\alpha$ simultaneously. Take the embedding $U\rightarrow \mathcal{D}(U)$ which sends a point to the corresponding Dirac unit mass. It is in the "top layer" $\alpha=0$. What about making this embedding smooth? By taking Gateau derivatives, you see that you start cascading down to deeper and deeper alphas. This is also in accordance with the physical intuition behind dipoles,...multipolar charge distributions which were a source of inspiration for L. Schwartz. BTW Hahn-Banach is not needed. One can use truncation/convolution to reduce to $\mathcal{S}'$ and the Hermite function basis (see Barry Simon's JMP article). 

The two volumes by Bratteli and Robinson. The book on lattice gases by Simon also has material on quantum statistical mechanics. 

A small remark: Bezout's theorem is not just about plane curves but includes the higher-dimensional version. See: General Theory of Algebraic Equations. The French original is freely available here. 

If $p>q$: then $r>q$ and after pairwise elimination of $q$ $\epsilon$-$\tau$ pairs, one is left with $q$ direct contractions of vectors and covectors mediated by a permutation in $S_q$ (this is the Schur-Weyl or $GL$ invariant part) as well as $(p-q)/d$ surviving $\tau$'s giving what the classics called "Klammerfaktoren" involving vectors only. If $p<q$: then $r<q$ and after pairwise elimination of $r$ $\epsilon$-$\tau$ pairs, one is left with $p$ direct contractions of vectors and covectors mediated by a permutation in $S_p$ (this is again the Schur-Weyl or $GL$ invariant part) as well as $(q-p)/d$ surviving $\epsilon$'s giving "Klammerfaktoren" involving covectors only. What you are interested in is the special case $p=q=n$, or pure Schur-Weyl situation with no "Klammerfaktoren". In other words, Schur-Weyl duality part b) is this particular case of the First Fundamental theorem of classical invariant theory for $SU(d)$ slash $SL(d)$. 

A trivial example of periodizable graph with $c_v=1$ is the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$: take big hypercubes containing the fixed vertex $v$ and put "periodic boundary conditions". The MO question I asked recently is about an example at the opposite end of the spectrum: the infinite 3-regular tree. If restricting to Cayley graphs makes the question easier to connect to the available literature, that's perfectly fine. I am interested in possibly more general situations where ${\rm Aut}(G)$ could even be trivial but understanding the Cayley graph case would already be a big help. Addendum: One could define an invariant of the graph I would call the periodic movability constant ${\rm PM}(G)$ as the supremum in $[0,1]$ of numbers $c$ for which one could do the construction above with $c_v=c$ for all vertices. I would be particularly interested in examples of graphs with $0<{\rm PM}(G)<1$ if they exist. 

$g_{\infty}$ in the usual Schwartz space of $\mathbb{R}$, i.e., smooth with fast decay at infinity and likewise for all its derivatives. for all $p$, $g_p$ is in the Schwartz-Bruhat space for $\mathbb{Q}_p$, i.e., locally constant and compactly supported. for all except at most finitely many $p$'s, $g_p$ is the indicator function of $\mathbb{Z}_p$. 

Edit Jan 11, 2018 (continued): 1) The Fermat quadratic $F=x_1^2+x_2^2$. My construction works as is and one can take for the partitions $P_1$ and $P_2$ any two of the three pair partitions of $[4]$. To do this in a more principled way, let me modify the standard round robin scheduling algorithm in the even case. Instead of fixing $1$ and turning everybody else, I will turn $1$ too. This gives the two arrays $$ P_1=\left( \begin{array}{cc} 1 & 2 \\ 4 & 3 \end{array} \right)\ \ ,\ \ P_2=\left( \begin{array}{cc} 4 & 1 \\ 3 & 2 \end{array} \right)\ . $$ The pairs correspond to the columns of the arrays. The corresponding signs are $\epsilon_1=\epsilon_2=1$. This gives the matrix $$ M=\left( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 & x_2 & 0 & x_1 \\ -x_2 & 0 & x_1 & 0 \\ 0 & -x_1 & 0 & x_2 \\ -x_1 & 0 & -x_2 & 0 \end{array} \right) $$ with ${\rm Pf}(M)=F$. 2) The Fermat cubic $F=x_1^3+x_2^3+x_3^3$. The modified round robin rule gives the three pair partitions $$ P_1=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 6 & 5 & 4 \end{array} \right)\ ,\ P_2=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 6 & 1 & 2 \\ 5 & 4 & 3 \end{array} \right)\ ,\ P_3=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 5 & 6 & 1 \\ 4 & 3 & 2 \end{array} \right)\ . $$ One can also use an array of pairs to see what happens: $$ \left( \begin{array}{ccc} (16) & (25) & (34) \\ (23) & (14) & (56) \\ (45) & (36) & (12) \end{array} \right) $$ The partitions $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$ correspond to the rows of this array and their signs are $\epsilon_1=\epsilon_2=\epsilon_3=1$. A rather tedious inspection shows that the only pair partitions one can form using any pairs in this $3\times 3$ array are the previous ones and the three new ones corresponding to the columns of the array, i.e., $P_4=(16)(23)(45)$, $P_5=(25)(14)(36)$ and $P_6=(34)(56)(12)$. Remark that this looks nicer if one draws chord diagrams on a circle with three colors for $P_1$, $P_2$, $P_3$. The corresponding signs are $\epsilon_4=1$, $\epsilon_5=-1$ and $\epsilon_6=1$. Without any modification the Pfaffian should be $$ x_1^3+x_2^3+x_3^3+x_1 x_2 x_3-x_1 x_2 x_3+x_1 x_2 x_3 $$ where I emphasized the individual contributions of $P_1,\ldots,P_6$ on purpose. Now modify the weights of the pairs in the first row by factors $a,b,c$. The Pfaffian now becomes $$ abcx_1^3+x_2^3+x_3^3+ax_1 x_2 x_3-bx_1 x_2 x_3+cx_1 x_2 x_3 $$ so we get the Fermat cubic if we pick these weights so that $$ abc=1\ \ ,\ \ a-b+c=0 $$ For example we can take $a=\theta$, $b=1$, $c=\theta^5$ where $\theta=e^{\frac{i\pi}{3}}$. More explicitly, the Fermat cubic is $F={\rm Pf}(M)$ with $$ M=\left( \begin{array}{cccccc} 0 & x_3 & 0 & x_2 & 0 & \theta x_1 \\ -x_3 & 0 & x_2 & 0 & x_1 & 0 \\ 0 & -x_2 & 0 & \theta^5 x_1 & 0 & x_3 \\ -x_2 & 0 & -\theta^5 x_1 & 0 & x_3 & 0 \\ 0 & -x_1 & 0 & -x_3 & 0 & x_2 \\ -\theta x_1 & 0 & -x_3 & 0 & -x_2 & 0 \end{array} \right)\ . $$ There is an obvious pattern here but I don't know if it works for $n=4$ or the OP's question, that is, $n=5$. In fact, I just realized (via performing the same permutation on rows and columns) these are determinantal cases as in the comment by Will.
