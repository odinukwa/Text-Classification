You are correct to say that all the heavier elements in the universe were formed in stars. Stars like the sun fuse hydrogen into helium. When they get older they can fuse the helium into carbon (it actually takes 3 helium to make one carbon). Larger stars can fuse carbon into oxygen, and neon and elements in the first half of the periodic table. When the star runs out of fuel, the outer layers are gently ejected in what is called a planetary nebula (though it has directly to do with actual planets). The ejected gas is enriched with the heavier elements that the star has fused. The heavier elements in the planetary nebula mix with the hydrogen and helium gas in outer space and can later go on to be found in new stars. Most of the carbon and oxygen and nitrogen on earth was formed by this process. Very large stars will fuse all the way up to iron, and then collapse in a supernova. This releases a very large amount of energy, some of which is used to form elements heavier than iron. All the heavier elements (copper gold, uranium for example) are formed in supernovae. The supernovae explosion distributes these elements back into space, mixed in with the debris from the star, as time goes on, and stars are born and die, the gas in space gets enriched with more and more heavier elements So the heavier elements are formed in the cores of stars, and are stored there until the star dies, when some of the star's atoms are released into space. The heavier elements are not "radiated out" of the star, until the star dies. Some stars die in a supernova explosian, but most have a more peaceful death in a planetary nebula. 

In short, it doesn't work. the event horizon is defined as the region of space which you can't escape from, If you are between two black holes, and you can escape then by definition you are not inside the event horizon. In the case when there are two black holes, the black hole is not a Schwazchild black hole (which is a solution of Einstein's equations for a single point, uncharged non-spinning mass) and the event horizon is not spherical. To determine the shape of the event horizon for two masses you need to use numerical solutions of the equations, you can do this yourself with the Einstein Toolkit, but the computing requirements are very high. A supercomputer is required to get very far. In the exact situation you draw, it is likely that the release of graviational radiation would lead to a merger rather than a pass but you would need to run the simulation to confirm this. Now you can't just remain stationary inside the event horizon. If you started inside it you can't stay in the same place and wait for a the pass of the other black hole to pull you out. Inside the event horizon spacetime is flowing towards the singularity and even if the shape of the event horizon is changed by the passing of another black hole, nothing passes from inside to out. 

You have misunderstood the website. When the eclipse begins, in the morning, the sun will be in south-east, at a bearing of 135 degrees. At maximum eclipse (at about midday) the sun will be almost due south, at a bearing of 178 degrees. When the eclipse ends, in the afternoon, the sun will be in the south-west, at about 217 degrees bearing. The sun and the moon will move in the sky, due to the rotation of the Earth, this says nothing about the straightness of the path of the moon relative to the sun. 

The major axes of the planets are not aligned. The major axis passes through the perihelion, the solar system barycentre and the aphelion. So by looking up the Longitude of perihelion we can find the direction of the major axis: 

The underlying assumption in the paper is that the planet has water in liquid form. The paper suggests that finding both CO2 and CH4 in the atmosphere of a rocky planet in the "habitable zone" (in which water can exist in liquid form) would be hard to explain, without life. Thus one doesn't need to detect atmospheric oxygen. If you can detect both CO2 and CH4, this should be taken as evidence of anoxic life (probably in the form of microbes) Titan has CH4, but it doens't have much CO2 and there is no liquid water. Titan is not in the habitable zone. On Titan, H2O is a forms part of the "rocks", and the oceans are made of hydrocarbons. Titan is not a good location to look for life as it doesn't have free liquid water. We have a photo from Titan's surface and it isn't covered in Microbes 

It's too bright to look at. Your astronaut has permanent retinal damage The apparent magnitude of the sun from Earth is -26.7. From the asteroid belt it is -24.7 ($URL$ So it is dimmer, but it is still far too bright for her to look at without eye protection. Since she is standing in the vacuum of space, there is no atmosphere to protect her eyes from ultraviolet. Her eyes would be damaged by the intensity of the light. Within a few days her vision would become fuzzy, from the production of free radicals from ultraviolet exposure. If she shaded her eyes from the sun, then the lack of atmosphere would help. With no atmosphere to scatter the sunlight, the sky around the sun would be dark, and the planets would be pretty bright. However, you specify "no light blockers" which means that our astronaut's eyes are basically toast. 

When the article speaks of the "age", what it means is that we are seeing that galaxy as it was a long time ago. We are seeing it as a very young galaxy. The galaxy is very far away, so light has taken a long time to reach us from the galaxy. The light from the galaxy is 11 billion years old. We measure the age of the galaxy by finding its distance from us. To find the distance we use the Hubble Law, which states that the further away a galaxy is, the faster it moves away from us, due to the expansion of the universe. And we can measure the speed that the galaxy is moving away from us because when an object moves very fast, the light from that object becomes shifted towards longer wavelengths (red-shifted). By measuring light that is known to have a fixed wavelength when not red shifted, we can find the speed of the galaxy accurately, and then use the Hubble Law to find the distance, and hence the age of the galaxy. (source) A1689B11 has a redshift z=2.54 which corresponds to a light travel time of 11.1 billion years Gravitational lensing makes the galaxy brighter, so it can be observed at these immense distances, it isn't directly used for finding the distance, but without gravitational lensing, the galaxy wouldn't be visible.
