Blowing-up $n-1$ points $\{p_1,...,p_{n-1}\}$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-3}$ and then all the strict transforms of linear spaces generated by subsets of $\{p_1,...,p_{n-1}\}$ in order of increasing dimension. Blowing-up, in order of increasing dimension, suitable smooth subvarieties of the diagonals of $(\mathbb{P}^1)^{n-3}$. 

By Corollary $2.10$ in $URL$ Let $f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ be a proper morphism of Deligne-Mumford stacks and $\mathcal{F}\in D^+_c(\mathcal{X})$, $\mathcal{G}\in D^+(\mathcal{Y})$. The the morphsim $$Rf_{*}R\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathcal{F},f^{!}\mathcal{G})\rightarrow R\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{X}}(Rf_{*}\mathcal{F},Rf_{*}f^{!}\mathcal{G})\rightarrow R\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{Y}}(Rf_{*}\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}).$$ is an isomorphism. If $f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ is a representable ﬁnite étale morphism of noetherian algebraic stacks, then the functor $f^{!}$ is the same as $f^{*}$. Therefore we have an isomorphism $$Rf_{*}R\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathcal{F},f^{*}\mathcal{G})\rightarrow R\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{X}}(Rf_{*}\mathcal{F},Rf_{*}f^{*}\mathcal{G})\rightarrow R\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{Y}}(Rf_{*}\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}).$$ Finally, $f$ finite implies $R^if_*\mathcal{F} = 0$ for $i\geq 1$. Therefore, if $\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathcal{F},f^{*}\mathcal{G}) = 0$ we get $$f_{*}\mathcal{E}xt^{1}_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathcal{F},f^{*}\mathcal{G})\cong \mathcal{E}xt^{1}_{\mathcal{Y}}(f_{*}\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}).$$ 

Let $K$ be a finite field. Is there a formula for the number of isomorphism classes of genus $g$ smooth curves over $K$? In other words does there exists a formula for the number of rational points of the stack $\mathcal{M}_{g}$ over $K$? If so, what is a standard reference for this? 

By C. Hacon, J. McKernan, "On the existence of ﬂips", math.AG/0507597. finiteness of minimal models in dimension $n-1$ implies the existence of flips in dimension $n$. I guess the result you are looking for is Theorem B (pag 11) of BCHM ($URL$ Perhaps Section 5.5 (pag 20) of this O. Fujino, "Recent developments in minimal model theory", $URL$ is easier to read. 

In general the obstruction to lift a scheme $X$ in characteristic zero is in $H^2(X,T_X)$. For examples of $3$-folds in positive characteristic that connot be lifted in characteristic zero you may look at Theorem 22.4 in Hartshorne's "Deformation Theory". 

Therefore to show that $X$ is not toric one could prove that $-K_X$ is not big or work out a nef divisor which is not semiample. 

As in Jason's answer take $n = 4$. The fibrations $\widetilde{f}_i$'s for $i=1,..,4$ are induced by the linear systems $\mathcal{L}_i$ of the lines through $p_i$ for $i=1,...,4$. Now, take the linear system of $\mathcal{C}_{1,2,3,4}$ of conics through $p_1,...,p_4$. This is a pencil and therefore induces a rational map $g:\mathbb{P}^2\dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^1$. Once you blow-up the four base points you get a morphism $\widetilde{g}:X_4\rightarrow\mathbb{P}^1$. Since $\widetilde{g}$ and the $\widetilde{f}_i$'s are induced by non-equivalent linear systems we have $\widetilde{g}\neq \widetilde{f}_i$ for any $i=1,...,4$. 

The result closer to your question I know is the following: Let $X\subset\mathbb{P}^{N}$ be a variety set theoretically defined by homogeneous polynomials $G_{i}$ of degree $d_{i}$, for $i = 1,..,m$, and let $l\geq 2$ be an integer. If $$\sum_{i=1}^{m}d_{i}\leq \frac{N(l-1)+m}{l}$$ then $X$ is rationally chain connected by chains of lines of length at most $l$. In particular if $X$ is smooth and the above inequality is satisfied then $X$ is rationally connected by rational curves of degree at most $l$. As corollaries we get: 

One can obtain $\overline{M}_{0,n}$ (the moduli space of $n$-pointed rational curves) in at leat two ways: 

The algorithm of the second paper has been implemented in this MacAulay2 package: $URL$ With this you can easily compute intersections of tautological classes on $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ for small values of $g,n$. 

Note that $-1 = i^2$. Thus your action is $(x,y)\mapsto (i^2x,iy)$. You can interpret this in the following way. Let $\epsilon\in \mu_4$ and consider tha action given by $(x,y)\mapsto (\epsilon^2 x,\epsilon y)$. The quotient $X = \mathbb{C}^2/\mu_4$ is given by $X = (w^2-uv = 0)\subset\mathbb{A}^3$. This is because as you observed the invariant polynomials are $x^2,y^4,xy^2$. Now, the singularity of $X$ at the origin is a cyclic quotient singularity of type $\frac{1}{4}(1,2) = \frac{1}{2}(1,1)$. That is a $A_1$ singularity. In other words $X$ is a quadric cone and you can solve the singularity at the vertex $v\in X$ just by blowing-up $v$. You get a smooth surface $Y=Bl_vX\rightarrow X$ and the exceptional divisor $E$ over $v$ is a $(-2)$-curve. That is $E\cong\mathbb{P}^1$ and $E^2 = -2$. You can see it in another way. Consider the action of $\mathbb{C}^{*}$ on $\mathbb{C}^{3}\setminus\{0\}$ given by $$\lambda (x,y,z)\mapsto (\lambda x,\lambda^2 y, \lambda^4 z).$$ The quotient is the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(1,2,4)$. The singularity at $[0:0:1]\in\mathbb{P}(1,2,4)$ is exactly the singularity you are looking at. Now, the second truncation of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y,z]$ is $\mathbb{C}[x^2,y,z]$ and $\mathbb{P}(1,2,4)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}(1,2/2,4/2) = \mathbb{P}(1,1,2)$. Finally, you see that your singularity is the one given by the action $(x,y)\mapsto (-x,-y)$, and that $\mathbb{P}(1,1,2)$ can be embedded in $\mathbb{P}^3$ as a quadric cone. The second example you are looking at is a complete intersection of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^4$. Both the quadrics are singular along double lines $L,R$. Therefore the surface $X$ has an ordinary singularity of multiplicity $4$ at the point $p = L\cap R$. Since $p$ is an ordinary singularity you can resolve it just by blowing-up once. 

For the Jacobian criterion it is fundamental to consider $I(V)$ and not just an ideal $I$ such that $V = V(I)$. For instance, take $I = ((x-1)^2)$. Then $V(I) = \{p\}\subset\mathbb{A}^1$. We have $rank (J_p(I)) = 0$. However, $dim(V) = 0\neq dim(\mathbb{A}^1)-rank (J_p(I))$. The answer is negative also if the polynomials generating $I$ are irreducible. For instance, consider the quadric surface $Q$ given by $$ \det \left(\begin{matrix} x & y \\ y & z \end{matrix}\right) =0 $$ and the cubic surface $S$ given by $$ \det \left(\begin{matrix} x & y & z \\ y & z & w \\ z & w & x \end{matrix}\right) =0 $$ On a general point $p = [u^3:u^2v:uv^2:v^3]\in Y$ we have $Jac(Q)(p) = (uv^2,-2u^2v,u^3,0)$ and $Jac(S)(p) = (v^2(u^4-v^4),-2uv(u^4-v^4),u^2(u^4-v^4),0)$. Therefore, $\mathbb{T}_pQ = \mathbb{T}_pS$ for a general point $p\in Y$. This means that, if $Y\subset\mathbb{P}^3$ is the twisted cubic then $Q\cap S = Y$ set-theoretically. However, scheme-theoretically $Q$ and $S$ cut $Y$ twice. Now, take the affine chart $w\neq 0$. Then, if $I =(xz-y^2,x^2z-x-y^2x+2yz-z^3)$ we have that $V(I)$ is the affine twisted cubic $C$. However, $rank(Jac_{(0,0,0)}(I)) = 1$. Then $$dim(\mathbb{A}^3)- rank(Jac_{(0,0,0)}(I)) = 2 \neq dim(C) = 1.$$ A simpler example: take the two curves $C = \{y-x^2 = 0\}$ and $L = \{y = 0\}$ in $\mathbb{A}^2$. Note that $L$ is the tangent line of $C$ in $(0,0)$. Both $C$ and $L$ are irreducible. Now, if $I = (y-x^2,y)$ then $V(I) = \{(0,0)\}$. On the other hand the scheme defined by $I$ is non-reduced. Indeed it is the origin with multiplicity two. In this case $rank(Jac_{(0,0)}(I)) = 1$, and $$dim(\mathbb{A}^2)- rank(Jac_{(0,0,0)}(I)) = 1 \neq dim(V(I)) = 0.$$ 

Let $f:X\dashrightarrow Y$ be a small map. Let $D$ be a big divisor on $D$. Then for $m >>0$ the map $\phi_{mD}:Y\dashrightarrow Z$, induced by $mD$ is birational. Now, if $\Delta:=f^{*}D$, then the map induced by $m\Delta$ is $\phi_{mD}\circ f$, which is birational as well. Therefore $\Delta$ is big. We conclude that $D$ is big if and only if $\Delta$ is big. In particular $-K_Y$ is big if and only if $-K_X$ is big. In you case, $-K_X$ ample $\Rightarrow$ $-K_X$ big $\Rightarrow$ $-K_Y$ big. By Corollary 2.2.7. in Lazarsfeld, "Positivity in Algebraic Geometry I", a divisor $D$ is big if and only if there exists an ample divisor $A$ and a positive integer $m$ such that $mD = A+N$, where $N$ is effective. Therefore $-(-D+\frac{1}{m}N) = \frac{1}{m}A$. In you case $D = -K_Y$ and you get that $-(K_Y+\frac{1}{m}N) = \frac{1}{m}A$ is ample. 

The moduli space $\overline{M}_{1,2}$ can not be the blow up of $\mathbb{P}^{2}$ in $2$ points because its rational Picard group has rank $2$, indeed it is generated by the divisor parametrizing genus $0$ irreducible nodal curves with $2$ marked points and the divisor parametrizing reducible curves whose components are a smooth genus $1$ curve and a smooth genus $0$ curve with $2$ marked points. The moduli space of genus $1$ stable curves with $2$ marked points is a rational surface with four singular points. Two singular points lie in $M_{1,2}$, and are: a singularity of type $\frac{1}{4}(2,3)$ representing an elliptic curve of Weierstrass representation $C_{4}$ with marked points $[0:1:0]$ and $[0:0:1]$; a singularity of type $\frac{1}{3}(2,4)$ representing an elliptic curve of Weierstrass representation $C_{6}$ with marked points $[0:1:0]$ and $[0:1:1]$. The remaining two singular points lie on the boundary divisor $\Delta_{0,2}$, and are: a singularity of type $\frac{1}{6}(2,4)$ representing a reducible curve whose irreducible components are an elliptic curve of type $C_{6}$ and a smooth rational curve connected by a node; a singularity of type $\frac{1}{4}(2,6)$ representing a reducible curve whose irreducible components are an elliptic curve of type $C_{4}$ and a smooth rational curve connected by a node. From this one can prove that: The moduli space of genus $1$ stable curves with $2$ marked points is isomorphic to a weighted blow up of the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{P}(1,2,3)$ in its smooth point $[1:0:0]$. In particular $\overline{M}_{1,2}$ is a toric variety. 

Let us look at varieties over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. You have $X$ open in $\overline{X}$, and $\Delta = \overline{X}\setminus X$. Then $\Delta$ could easily be not normal crossing. For instance take a cusp $C\subset\mathbb{P}^2$. However, by Hironaka's theorem there exists a log resolution $\pi:Y\rightarrow\overline{X}$. This means that $Y$ is smooth and $\pi^{-1}(D)\cup Exc(\pi)$ is a normal crossing divisor. Furthermore since $X = \overline{X}\setminus\Delta$ itself is smooth $\pi_{|\pi^{-1}(X)}:\pi^{-1}(X)\rightarrow X$ is an isomorphism. Therefore we found an open embedding of $X$ in a smooth proper scheme $Y$ such that $Y\setminus X$ is normal crossing. 

The Goldbach's conjecture: Every even integer $k>2$ can be expressed as the sum of two primes. The Waring's problem: For each natural number $d$ there is a positive integer $h$ such that every natural number is the sum of at most $h$ $d$-th powers of natural numbers. For every $d$, let $h(d)$ denote the minimum number of $d$-th powers needed to represent all integers. The problem is to find $h(d)$. For instance $h(1)=1, h(2)=4, h(3)=9, h(4)=19$. Euler's conjecture: $h(d)=2^d+[(\frac{3}{2})^d]-2$. 

First of all, note that $\pi:X\rightarrow Y$ bijective is not enough to conclude that $\pi$ is an isomorphism. For instance consider $C\subset\mathbb{A}^2$ a cubic with a cusp and let $\pi:\mathbb{A}^1\rightarrow C$ given by $t\mapsto (t^2,t^3)$. Then $\pi$ is bijective, it is indeed a topological homomorphism. However, $C$ is singular and $\mathbb{A}^1$ is smooth. Therefore $\pi$ can not be an isomorphism. As you see the differential $d\pi_{0}$ of $\pi$ in zero is zero. Let $\pi:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism or relative dimension $r$ of smooth varieties over an algebraically closed field. Assume that the relative cotangent sheaf $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free of rank $r$ on $X$. We have an exact sequence $$\pi^{*}\Omega_{Y}\rightarrow\Omega_{X}\rightarrow\Omega_{X/Y}\mapsto 0.$$ Let $k(x)$ be the residue field at a closed point $x$. Tensorizing we get $$\pi^{*}\Omega_{Y}\otimes k(x)\rightarrow\Omega_{X}\otimes k(x)\rightarrow\Omega_{X/Y}\otimes k(x)\mapsto 0.$$ Since $X$ and $Y$ are smooth and $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free of rank $r$ these three vector spaces are of dimension $dim(Y),dim(X),r$ respectively. So the first map is injective and we have $$0\mapsto\pi^{*}\Omega_{Y}\otimes k(x)\rightarrow\Omega_{X}\otimes k(x)\rightarrow\Omega_{X/Y}\otimes k(x)\mapsto 0.$$ For any closed point $x\in X$ we have $k(x)\cong k$. Therefore we can identify the injective map $\pi^{*}\Omega_{Y}\otimes k\rightarrow\Omega_{X}\otimes k$ with the map between the cotangent spaces $\mathfrak{m}_y/\mathfrak{m}^2_y\rightarrow\mathfrak{m}_x/\mathfrak{m}^2_x$ where $y = \pi(x)$. Dualizing we have that the differential $T_\pi(x):T_xX\rightarrow T_yY$ is surjective. Therefore $\pi$ is a smooth morphism. In particular, if any fiber of $\pi$ is just one point, then $\Omega_{X/Y}$ is locally free of rank $r = 0$ and $\pi$ is a smooth morphism of relative dimension zero. Finally, since $\pi$ is surjective it is an isomorphism. 

Let $X$ be a variety with at most canonical singularities and ample canonical divisor $K_X$. Then $Aut(X) = Bir(X)$. The canonical ring $R$ of $X$ is finitely generated. Furthermore $$X\cong Proj(R)=X_{can}$$ since $K_X$ is ample and $X$ has at most canonical singularities. Now, any birational automorphism $f:X\rightarrow X$ induces an automorphism of the canonical ring $R$ which in turns induces a biregular automorphism of $X$. So $f$ itself is biregular. More generally, if $X,Y$ are projective varieties with $K_X$, $K_Y$ ample and at most canonical singularities, then any birational map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is indeed biregular. 

Take $X = X_1\cup\dots\cup X_k\subset\mathbb{P}^n$ be the union of $k$ distinct smooth hypersurfaces with $\deg(X_i)\geq 2$ for $i = 1,\dots,k$, and $d = 1$. For any point $p\in X_i$ then intersection $T_pX\cap X$ is singular at $p$. Therefore, the dual hypersurface $X_i^{*}$ is a component of $S_1$. Now, if $X_{i}^{*} = X_{j}^{*}$ then $X_i = X_i^{**} = X_j^{**} = X_j$. Then $X_i^{*} \neq X_j^{*}$ if $i\neq j$, and $S_1$ has at least $k$ irreducible components. The irreducibility of $S_1$ holds if $X$ is smooth since the dual variety of a smooth variety is irreducible. 

The first construction is due to Kapranov, you can find it for instance in Section 6.2 "B. Hassett, Moduli spaces of weighted pointed stable curves, Advances in Mathematics 173 (2003) 316–352". The second one is due tue Keel, see Section 6.3 of the same paper. Putting togheter 1 and 2 you see that $(\mathbb{P}^1)^{n-3}$ can always be obtained from $\mathbb{P}^{n-3}$ by a sequence of blow-ups and blow-downs along smooth centers. In your case, $n =6$, Kapranov constrction is as follows: 

Let $X$ be a Toric Variety and let $x\in X$ be a point (not necessarily smooth). Then the blow up $Bl_{x}X$ of $X$ in $x$ is Toric. Let $Y:=WBl_{x}X$ be the weighted blow up of $X$ in $x$ with weights $a_{1},...,a_{n}$. Is $Y$ Toric ? In particular, is a weighted blow up of a weighted projective space Toric ?
