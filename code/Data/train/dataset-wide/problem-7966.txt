I assume that by "all derivatives" you mean derivatives of every order. Suppose that all transitions between normal coordinates have uniformly bounded derivatives within some radius $r$. For every point $p$ we have a unit radial vector field $V=V(p)$ whose derivatives are uniformly bounded at distances between, say $r/10$ and $r$ from $p$. (This holds in normal coordinates centered at $p$ and hence in normal coordinates centered at any nearby point.) Now fix a point $q\in M$ and arrange points $p_k$, $k=1,\dots,\frac{n(n+1)}2$, where $n=\dim M$, so that the distances from $q$ to $p_k$ equal $r/2$ and the corresponding vector fields $V_k=V(p_k)$ at $q$ are generic in the sense that the symmetric tensors $V_k\otimes V_k$ are linearly independent. Then the same holds at every point in a neighborhood of $q$. Actually the points $p_k$ should have some prescribed coordinates in normal coordinate system centered at $q$, then all subsequent estimates are uniform. We have a system of equations $g(V_k,V_k)=1$, $k=1,\dots,\frac{n(n+1)}2$. At every point near $q$ this is a nondegenerate linear system on the components of the metric tensor $g$. Hence it uniquely determines $g$ via some explicit formulae in terms of $V_k$. Since the derivatives of $V_k$ are uniformly bounded, so are the derivatives of the metric tensor. 

I think what you are looking for is boundary at infinity. For example, the boundary at infinity of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb H^2$ is its "ideal boundary" circle, and adding it to $\mathbb H^2$ yields a topological disc. There are many (non-equivalent) definitions of the term to choose from, depending on how weird your spaces are and what asymptotic properties you want to capture. Probably the most "classic" one is Gromov's, which works perfectly for your example. Fix a point $o\in A$ (the "origin", on which the result does not depend). To each point $p\in A$, associate a function $f_p:A\to\mathbb R$, defined as follows: $$ f_p(x) = dist(x,p)-dist(o,p) $$ The map $p\mapsto f_p$ is a quite reasonable representation of $A$ in the space of (1-Lipschitz, fixed at the origin) functions on $A$. The desired compactification is the closure of the range $\{f_p:p\in A\}$ in the compact open topology. It is indeed compact if $A$ is a proper metric space (i.e., all closed balls are compact). The functions that are in the closure but not in the original set form the "boundary at infinity" of $A$. They are similar to Busemann functions of geodesic rays (and actually are Busemann functions if $A$ is a complete Riemannian manifold). 

Consider co-dimension 0. In this case, bundles are covering maps, with all the goodies that they bring. And submersions are just local homeomorphisms - not very exciting compared to coverings. 

Suppose $F$ has no fixed points. Define $x\sim y$ iff $x=y$ or $x=F(y)$. The the projection of $\mathbb R^2$ to the quotient $X=\mathbb R^2/\sim$ is a 2-fold covering map and hence $\pi_1(X)=\mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$. Hence there are non-contractible loops in $X$, and it is easy to find one without self-intersections. The pre-image of such a loop is a Jordan curve in $\mathbb R^2$ invariant under $F$. The domain bounded by this curve is also invariant. Now apply Brouwer's fixed point theorem and that's it. 

To 2, the answer is yes. This is easy. Re-enumerate points according to their cyclic order. For every fixed $k$ ($1\le k<n$), the product $$ D_k:= \prod_i |P_i P_{i+k}| $$ (where the indices are taken modulo $n$), equals $$ D_k=\prod_i 2\sin (t_i/2) = 2^n\exp \left(\sum_i \log\sin(t_i/2) \right) $$ where $t_i$ is the (oriented) angle from $P_i$ to $P_{i+k}$. Since $t_i\in(0,2\pi)$, $\sum t_i=2\pi k$, and the function $t\mapsto \log\sin(t/2)$ is concave on $(0,2\pi)$, by Jensen's inequality the maximum is attained when all $t_i$ are equal, i.e., when the points are equally spaced. Since $D=\prod_k D_k^{1/2}$, the result follows. 

Here is a simple proof that the property holds only for Euclidean norms, at least if the norm in question is $C^1$ smooth and strictly convex. Surely it was known way before Gromov was born. Let $S$ denote the unit sphere of the norm. First observe that, if $v\in S$ and $w$ are such that $\|w+tv\|\ge \|tv\|$ for all $t\in\mathbb R$, than $w$ is parallel to the tangent plane to $S$ at $v$. So we have a map $F$ from the set of 2-dimensional linear subspaces to the set of 1-dimensional subspaces such that, for every linear plane $P$, the line $F(P)$ is parallel to the tangent planes at all points of $S\cap P$. Smoothness and strict convexity imply that this map is continuous and injective, hence it is bijective. If a collection of planes contain a common line (or, equivalently, a common unit vector $v$), then their $F$-images belong to one plane (namely the one parallel to the tangent plane to $S$ at $v$). Now consider the set of planes and the set of lines as models of the real projective plane (they are the projectivizations of $(\mathbb R^3)^*$ and $\mathbb R^3$, resp.) Now we have a bijection from the projective plane to itself that sends lines to lines, hence a projective map. Thus there is a linear map $L:(\mathbb R^3)^*\to\mathbb R^3$ whose projectivization is $F$. This means that, if a plane $P$ is the kernel of some element $p\in(\mathbb R^3)^*$, then $L(p)$ is a vector from the line $F(P)$. This map $L$ defines a non-degenerate bilinear form on $\mathbb R^3$ in a standard way, and $F(P)$ is just the orthogonal complement to $P$ w.r.t. this form. Since $F(P)$ obviously never belongs to $P$, the bilinear form is sign-definite (assume positive), so it is a Euclidean structure. In this Euclidean structure, the tangent planes to $S$ are orthogonal to their corresponding radial vectors. It follows that $S$ is a sphere of this Euclidean structure. 

No. Let $C_2$ be the unit circle and $C_1$ be a big square with corners rounded off by circle arcs of radius $r\ll 1$. The integral for $C_2$ is the same as for the $r$-circle and this is very small. 

As Anton mentioned in a comment, a non-Riemannian Finsler manifold cannot be an Alexandrov space. If you found an opposite statement in our book, I would appreciate the page number where it appears (I maintain a list of errors and misprints, there are way too many of them in the book). Alexandrov spaces generalize Riemannian manifolds with lower or upper curvature bounds. I am not aware of any synthetic, metric space level definition that could work as a concept of a lower curvature bound (or even of nonnegative curvature) for Finsler metrics. There is a generalization of nonpositive curvature, called "Busemann nonpositive curvature". It says that if $p$ and $q$ are midpoints of two segments $[xy]$ and $[xz]$, then $d(p,q)\le d(y,z)/2$. Equivalently, the distance between points on two geodesics is convex (as a function of two parameters). This is weaker than CAT(0). In the Riemannian case, this is equivalent to nonpositive sectional curvature, but, unlike Alexandrov's CAT(0) definition, this one has Finsler examples (e.g. any flat Finsler metric). The Busemann definition is not very popular for a number of reasons, but at least there is a globalization theorem (a la Cartan-Hadamard) and uniqueness of geodesics in homotopy classes. As for non-reversible Finsler metrics, they are not very different from reversible ones. You just have to be careful with the order of arguments of a distance function, and then most things generalize in a straightforward way. Many geometers (myself included) often assume reversibility just because they are not comfortable with non-symmetric distances and think they are not interesting enough to worth the trouble. 

If the second $\delta(\varepsilon)$ is allowed to differ from the first one, then there is a simple implicit argument: Suppose the contrary, then there is a sequence $X_n$ of 2-dimensional normed spaces satisfying the definition with the same function $\delta(\varepsilon)$ and points $x_n,y_n\in X_n$ with $\|x_n\|\le 1$, $\|y_n\le 1\|$, $\|x_n-y_n\|\ge\varepsilon$ but $\|(x_n+y_n)/2\|\ge 1-\delta_n$ where $\delta_n\to 0$. Since the Banach--Mazur compactum is compact, there is a converging subsequence, and the limit space satisfies the definition for the same $\delta(\varepsilon)$ but contains two points $x,y$ with $\|x\|\le 1$, $\|y\|\le 1$, $\|x-y\|\ge\varepsilon$ and $\|(x+y)/2\|\ge 1$, a contradiction. In fact, you can always choose the same $\delta(\varepsilon)$ in the second case provided that $\dim X\ge 2$. Suppose the contrary, then there are points $x,y\in X$ such that $\|x\|\le 1$, $\|y\|\le 1$, $\|x-y\|\ge\varepsilon$ but $\|(x+y)/2\|=1-\delta_1$ where $\delta_1<\delta=\delta(\varepsilon)$. We may assume that $X$ is 2-dimensional (otherwise restrict to a 2-dimensional subspace containing $x$ and $y$). Fix $\delta_1$ and from all such pairs $x,y$ choose one that minimize $\big|\|x\|-\|y\|\big|$. I claim that this minimizing pair satisfies $\|x\|=\|y\|$. Suppose the contrary: let $\|x\|>\|y\|$. Denote $z=(x+y)/2$, $v=(x-y)/2$. If $v$ is proportional to $x$, choose any $v'$ with $\|v'\|=\|v\|$ such that $\|z+v\|\ne \|z\|\pm\|v\|$. Then the points $x'=z+v'$ and $y'=z-v'$ show that $x$ and $y$ did not minimize $\big|\|x\|-\|y\|\big|$. If $v$ is not proportional to $x$, choose a vector $w$ parallel to a supporting line to the unit sphere of $\|\cdot\|$ at the point $v/\|v\|$. Note that $w$ cannot be parallel to a supporting line at $x/\|x\|$, so either $\|x+tw\|<\|x\|$ or $\|x-tw\|<\|x\|$ for a sufficiently small $t>0$. Hence the points $x'=x+tw$ and $y'=y-tw$ or $x'=x-tw$ and $y'=y+tw$ provide a counter-example with $\big|\|x'\|-\|y'\|\big|<\big|\|x\|-\|y\|\big|$. Thus the minimizing pair satisfies $\|x\|=\|y\|$. Multiplying by $\|x\|^{-1}$ we get a counter-example with $\|x\|=\|y\|=1$. 

Yes. Here is an elementary proof. Construct a distance non-increasing retraction $p:S^{n-1}\setminus B_r(a)\setminus B_r(b)\to \partial B_r(a)$. (For example: divide the sphere into two-hemispheres by the hyperplane $H$ of symmetry between $a$ and $b$. In the hemisphere containing $a$, let $p$ be the radial projection, namely $p(x)$ is the intersection of the geodesic segment $[ax]$ with $\partial B_r(a)$. In the other hyperplane, let $p$ be the composition of the reflection in $H$ and the above radial projection. This map is distance non-increasing since the radial projection to $\partial B_r(a)$ is distance non-increasing away from the $r$-pall centered at the point opposite to $a$ on the sphere, and this ball is contained in the second hemisphere.) For each $x\in \partial B_r(a)$, the pre-image $p^{-1}(x)$ contains a continuous path connecting $\partial B_r(a)$ to $\partial B_r(b)$ and therefore a point of the set $\{f=0\}$. Hence $p(\{f=0\})=\partial B_r(a)$. Since $p$ does not decrease distances, it does not increase the Hausdorff measure and the desired inequality follows. 

It is a $C^\infty$ manifold if you define charts properly (e.g. using geodesics normal to the boundary as coordinate lines). The metric of the double is $C^2$ (but not always $C^3$). Indeed, since the boundary is totally geodesic, the normal derivative of the metric tensor (in the above mentioned coordinates) vanishes, and the second normal derivatives on two copies match due to the symmetry. 

It is undecidable. If you could solve this, you could also solve Hilbert's 10th problem. Suppose we have an algorithm solving your problem for all $n$. Given a polynomial $p\in\mathbb[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, let's decide whether it has integer solutions. If $p$ is constant, this is trivial. Otherwise we can find $z_0\in\mathbb Z^n$ such that $|p(x)|>1$ for all $x\in z_0+[0,1]^n$. Let's work with a polynomial $f(x)=p(x+z_0)$ rather than $p$. It satisfies $|f(x)|>1$ for all $x\in[0,1]^n$. Let $g(x)=x_1(x_1-1)x_2(x_2-1)\dots x_n(x_n-1)$. Apply our algorithm to the inequality $$ r(x):=(f(x)^2-1)\cdot g(x)<0 . $$ If it says that $S+\mathbb Z^n=\mathbb R^n$, then we know that $S$ contains a point from $\mathbb Z^n$, and this point must a root of $f$. If it says that $S+\mathbb Z^n\ne\mathbb R^n$, then we know that there is $c\in\mathbb R^n$ such that $r(c+z)\ge 0$ for all $z\in\mathbb Z^n$. This $c$ must belong to $\mathbb Z^n$. Indeed, suppose that e.g. $c_1\notin\mathbb Z$. We may assume that all coordinates of $c$ are positive and $0<c_1<1$. Substitute $z=(0,z_2,\dots,z_n)$ where $z_2,\dots,z_n$ are arbitrary positive integers and conclude that $|f(c+z)|\le1$ for all such $z$. It follows that $f$ is constant on the hyperplane $\{x_1=c_1\}$, and the modulus of this constant no greater than 1. This contradicts the fact that $|f|>1$ on $[0,1]^n$. Thus we know that $c\in\mathbb Z^n$, or, equivalently, that $r(z)\ge 0$ for all $z\in\mathbb Z^n$. This means that $f$ does not have integer roots except possibly at points where one of the coordinates is 0 or 1. Thus we reduced the problem to the case of $n-1$ variables and can solve it by induction.
