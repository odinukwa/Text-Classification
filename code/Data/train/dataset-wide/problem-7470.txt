[EDIT: A previous version mistakenly argued that the fundamental group of X was responsible for torsion in the Picard group. I hope that this is correct now! Btw, there is probably a more direct way of arguing, but I cannot find one at the moment.] The Picard group of X is torsion free if and only if the group ${\rm H_1}(X,\mathbf{Z})$ vanishes. By the exponential sequence, the torsion in the Picard group of X comes from the torsion in ${\rm H^2}(X,\mathbf{Z})$ and from ${\rm H^1}(X,\mathbf{C})/{\rm H^1}(X,\mathbf{Z})$. Thus the vanishing of ${\rm H_1}(X,\mathbf{Z})$ is equivalent (by the Universal Coefficient Theorem) to the torsion-freeness of the Picard group of X. ADDED (for explicitness) To make everything more explicit, assume that X is non-singular. The Picard group of X may contain torsion coming from two different sources. There might contain torsion in the connected component of the identity, and this is recorded by the torsion free part of the first homology group. Or there might be torsion in the component group of the Picard group, and this is recorded by the torsion in the first homology group. In terms of the exponential sequence, the first kind of torsion appears in the image of ${\rm H^1}(X,\mathbf{C})$, while the second one "appears" in torsion in ${\rm H^2}(X,\mathbf{Z})$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem implies that the "combination" of these two groups is the whole first integral homology group. An example of torsion of the first kind is already present in the case of curves of genus at least one: the Jacobian of the curve contains plenty of torsion bundles. An example of torsion of the second kind is the case of Enriques surfaces: the canonical divisor on such a surface is a torsion line bundle that is non-trivial. If the characteristic of the ground-field is different from two, the corresponding cover of X is a K3 surface. 

To compute the period matrix, I am struggling mightily to actually write down the line integrals necessary. 

Technical aside and a minor confusion: It is not possible for $E^*_{S^1}(pt)$ to give us the elliptic curve $E$ in the usual way (as a ring of global functions) for elliptic curves (as examples of projective varieties) donâ€™t have interesting global functions. Presumably to remedy this, Grojnowski builds the sheaf over $E'$, a mild modification of the elliptic curve $E$. $$E^*_{S^1}(-): \{S^1\text{-spaces}\} \to \{\text{Sheaves over } E'\}$$ where $E'$ is defined as $E$ tensored with the lattice of cocharacters $\text{Hom}_{\text{Grp}}(S^1, T)$ of the compact torus $T = (S^1)^{\times n}$. $$E' := E \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \text{Hom}_{\text{Grp}}(S^1, T)$$ The lattice of cocharacters of $T$ is identified with the $\mathbb{R}$-linear dual of the Lie algebra of $T$. In our case, $T = S^1$, and $\text{Hom}_{\text{Grp}}(S^1, S^1) = \mathbb{Z}$, so $E' := E \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Z} = E$. The construction degenerates quite a bit in the $S^1$ case, so how are we still able to recover $E$ from the ring $E^*_{S^1}$? 

In many expositions, applying the Taniyama-Shimura formula to derive the height of the formal group law of an abelian variety has the following pattern. We begin with an abelian variety $A$ over $\mathbb{C}$ with complex multiplication by $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_N)$. Then, we end up because of "good reduction over $p$" with an abelian variety $B$ over a different field (it is not clear to me if this field is the reflex field or a field of characteristic $p$) with complex multiplication by a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Magically, the $CM$-type of $B$ is the same as that of $A$. 

An immediate comment is that, in the case of smooth manifolds, the notion that you suggest needs to take into account more than just the differentiable structure of $X$ and $Y$: any two smooth, connected, projective curves of the same genus $g \geq 2$ are diffeomorphic, but there is a flat morphism (in the usual sense) between them if and only if they are isomorphic as complex varieties. Since there is a family with $3g-3$ parameters of complex structures on curves of genus $g$, there seems to be the need for more structure to be encoded in the notion of an analogue of flatness. On the positive side, I have always thought that Morse functions have a feel similar to flat morphisms: while they do not seem to preserve the "numerical" character of flat functions (e.g. fibers may sprout off extra components), they nonetheless impose a certain bound on the variations of the fibers. More concretely, if $X$ consists of $g+1$ disjoint circles in the plane with centers along the $x$-axis (no two of which are contained in one another) and $Y$ is the $x$-axis, then I tend to think of the projection of $X$ onto the $x$-axis as the "real picture" of the degree two morphism from a curve of genus $g$ to $\mathbb{P}^1$. In this case, the projection is a Morse function and the morphism I think of is a flat morphism! To make the analogy more precise, you would probably have to impose some condition on the critical points to take into account the "automatic orientability" of the complex case: I am not sure that I would consider "flat" a Morse function from $S^1$ to $\mathbb{R}$ having more than two critical points. This might give a way of "curing" the issue with extra components appearing in fibers. 

I am attempting to calculate the period matrix of the Riemann surface associated to the zero set of a complex curve: $y^3 = x^4 -1$. Background: It is my understanding that the period matrix of a Riemann surface is defined as $\int_{\gamma_i} \omega_j$, where $\omega_1, ..., \omega_g$ are a choice of basis of the invariant differentials of the surface, and $\gamma_1, ..., \gamma_{2g}$ are a choice of basis for $H_1(S)$. I have calculated an invariant differential basis as $dx/y, dx/y^2, xdx/y^2$. 

Every formal group is isomorphic to $\oplus_i G_{n_i,m_i}$ up to isogeny. Every such $G_{n,m}$ (pick any coprime m, n) can be realized in the formal group decomposition associated to an abelian variety. 

In short, I still don't know over a general ring, but for $\mathbb{F}_q$, we have an answer: The idempotent completion of the essential image of $AbVar_{/\mathbb{F}_q}$ in $FG_{/\mathbb{F}_q}$ is categorically equivalent to $FG_{/\mathbb{F}_q}$. In Manin's paper, The Theory of Formal Commutative Groups over Fields of Finite Characteristic, he calls formal groups "algebroid" if they are the completion of algebraic varieties over any field $k$. He proves that every formal group over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is isogenous to a subgroup of an algebroid formal group over $\mathbb{F}_q$. The proof outline is: 

What confuses me is the statement that requiring $L \to R$ to be Landweber-exact is a weaker condition than flat. If we are requiring the functor $- \otimes_L R: MU^*(X) \to E^*(X)$ preserves exact sequences, then wouldn't it automatically be flat? What is an example of a formal group law that is Landweber-exact but not flat? 

There is a transition in the theory of complex multiplication which seems to be glossed over in all expositions I can find. I would like to explicitly find a theorem that allows me to do this. Background: Let us review the construction of a complex abelian variety $A$ with complex multiplication by $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_N)$ given by Taniyama-Shimura. We begin with $\mathbb{C}^g/\Phi(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_N])$ equipped with a Riemann form, where the embedding is given by: $$\Phi: \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_N] \to \mathbb{C}^g$$ $$a \mapsto (\sigma_1(a),..., \sigma_g(a))$$ where $\sigma_1, ..., \sigma_g$ are nonconjugate embeddings of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_N) \to \mathbb{C}$. There is an action of $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_N] =: L$, a commutative subgroup of $End_{\mathbb{Q}}(A)$ on the holomorphic tangent space of $A$. This action is defined by taking $$\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_N] \to End_{\mathbb{Q}}(A)$$ $$\alpha \times (z_1, ..., z_g) \mapsto (\sigma_1(\alpha)z_1, ..., \sigma_g(\alpha)z_g)$$ This action, the $CM$-type of $A$ gives a spectral decomposition of $\text{Lie } A$ (the holomorphic tangent space at the identity). 

@Dror: I will address your last comment in the question about bounding the genus from below. Here I wanted to add a remark: the explicit bound you found is such that any prime larger than this bound will be of "good" reduction. Unless the bound you compute is at most two, you are guaranteed the existence of smaller primes not dividing the resultant you computed. Since I assume from your question that you simply want to find a prime of "good" reduction, it is probably much more efficient to compute explicitly the resultant (over Z) and then look for primes not dividing it. In particular, it seems like you might necessarily have one such prime of the order not bigger than $d^3M$ (and possibly much smaller than this). Finally, why did you include the computation of the gcd of the resultant in $\mathbb{F}_p$? 

Let $G$ be the Dynkin diagram of $A_5$ and $H$ be the Dynkin diagram of $D_5$. Then $G$ can be extended to the Dynkin diagram of $E_6$, while $H$ can be extended to the Dynkin diagram of $D_6$. These examples satisfy your conditions. I would draw them, as they are not much more elaborate than paths, but my tex skills are not that good! 

Let $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3$ be three lines in the plane that do not all contain the same point. The triangle formed by $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3$ is the set obtained from $\ell_1 \cup \ell_2 \cup \ell_3$ by removing the three pairwise intersections of the lines. Clearly, any triangle is a blocking set: every line in the plane meets each line $\ell_1,\ell_2,\ell_3$, and cannot contain all the three points that we are removing from the triangle. Triangles are the only blocking sets we consider. We say that $A$ has property () if the intersection of $A$ with every triangle is not empty. Note that if a subset of the plane intersects non-trivially every blocking set, then it has property (). We prove the (a priori) stronger statement that a set with property () and at most $q+1$ elements consists of all the points contained in a line. Lemma 1.
