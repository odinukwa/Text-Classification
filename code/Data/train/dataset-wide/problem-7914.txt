Let me give a counter-example, where $f$ is moreover proper (see Piotr Achinger's comment), but $Y$ is not normal. Let $X$ be the affine plane over a field $k$ and let $\tilde{Y}$ be the blow-up of the origin in $X$. We choose two $k$-points $P_1$ and $P_2$ on the exceptional divisor, and consider the variety $Y$ constructed by gluing $P_1$ and $P_2$ transversally. There is an induced proper and birational morphism $f:Y\to X$, and the contraction $c:\tilde{Y}\to Y$ is nothing else than the normalization of $Y$. Moreover, we have the following exact sequence on $Y$: $$0\to\mathcal{O}_Y\to c_*\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{Y}}\to\mathcal{O}_P\to 0,$$ where we denoted by $P$ the common image of $P_1$ and $P_2$ in $Y$, and where the last arrow is given by the difference of evaluations at $P_1$ and $P_2$. We get a long exact sequence in cohomology (here we use that, the cohomology of $c_*\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{Y}}$ coincides with the cohomology of $\mathcal{O}_{\tilde{Y}}$ because $c$ is finite, and that $H^1(\tilde{Y},\mathcal{O}_\tilde{Y})=0$): $$0\to H^0(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)\to H^0(\tilde{Y},\mathcal{O}_\tilde{Y})\to H^0(P,\mathcal{O}_P)\to H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)\to 0.$$ Every global function on $\tilde{Y}$ is constant on the exceptional divisor (as it is proper and integral), and hence descends to $Y$ showing that the first map is an isomorphism. As a consequence, $H^0(P,\mathcal{O}_P)\to H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$ is an isomorphism, and $H^1(Y,\mathcal{O}_Y)$ is nonzero. 

Given a linear representation $\rho$ of $SL_n(\mathbb C)$ of finite dimension $m$, the image $\rho(U)$ of a maximal unipotent Jordan block $U\in SL_n$ decomposes into generally several Jordan blocks of size $m_1,\dots,m_k$. Is it possible to describe the partition $m=m_1+m_2+\dots+m_k$, say in terms of the highest weight vector associated to an irreducible representation $\rho$? 

I believe knot theory got started by 19th-century physicists (Lord Kelvin was one of the initiators) based on the assumption that atoms have to be knots in the ether. They started tabulating knots in the hope to shed light on the periodic table. The physics was rubbish but not the maths. 

A completely ineffective theoretical method goes as follows: Write $f(z)$ as $f_r(x,y)+if_i(x,y)$ where $f_r,f_i\in \mathbb R[x,y]$ are real polynomials in the real and complex part $x,y$ of $z=x+i y$. Compute a Groebner basis of the ideal $(f_r,f_i)$ with respect to an order which eliminates one of the variables in the first element of the basis and use real techniques (based on Sturm sequences) to compute, say, the real parts of all solutions. Use another element of the Groebner basis (or again real techniques) to compute the corresponding imaginary part and test for multiplicities (which can be avoided by computing first gcd$(f,f')$). Completely useless (and equivalent) variation: Study the intersection giving the zeroes of $f$ of the two real curves determined by $f_r$ and by $f_i$. 

Consider a random walk on a two-dimensional surface with circular reflecting boundary conditions (say, of radius 'R'). Here, for a fixed-size area, one finds a larger fraction of the probability density (for the position of the walker) near the midpoint of the circle than near its contour. Given this example, my question is - for a discrete/continuous random walk in a two-dimensional (or higher dimensional) space, now with arbitrary reflecting boundary conditions, how 'well' can one restrict/focus the mass of the probability density function to the smallest possible area relative to the total surface area available to the walker? In other words, how effectively can one construct a 'trap' (I'm using this term very loosely) for such a walker, given random initial conditions? (I obviously welcome any help to ask this question in a more appropriate manner.) 

Let $X$ be a projective complex K3 surface whose Néron-Severi-group is generated by two classes $h$ and $l$ such that $h^2=4$, $hl=1$ and $l^2=-2$ and $h$ is ample. One sees that such a surface exists using the surjectivity of the period map for K3 surfaces. General theorems about linear systems on K3 surfaces imply that $h$ is very ample and embeds $X$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$. Since $l^2=-2$, $l$ or $-l$ is effective. Since $hl=1$, it is $l$ that is effective, and it has to be the class of a line in $\mathbb{P}^3$. This line is a $-2$-curve and may be contracted to a node. Let $f:X\to Y$ be this contraction map. Since $Y$ is a singular K3 surface, if it were possible to embed it in $\mathbb{P}^3$, the degree of the embedding would necessarily be $4$, but this is impossible as no line bundle on $Y$ has this degree. 

I'm a little bit hesitant to ask this here, so please notice the tag. My hope is that someone will have a more satisfying answer than what I've heard before... A long time ago I read (perhaps 'browsed' is a better word) Wolfram's "A New Kind of Science". There are many many references to the "Rule 30" CA - $URL$ However, no intuitive reasoning for it's random/pseudorandom behavior is provided prior to a digression to the importance of the discovery. I was recently reminded of this when I heard that Mathematica (a program I use quite frequently) uses certain outputs from this CA as its random number generator. So my question is - beyond 'numerical phenomenology' is there an intuitive understanding why Rule 30 should behave in this random/pseudorandom manner? 

Let's say that I have a one-dimensional line of finite length 'L' that I populate with a set of 'N' random points. I was wondering if there was a simple/straightforward method (not involving long chains of conditional probabilities) of deriving the probability 'p' that the minimum distance between any pair of these points is larger than some value 'k' -i.e. if the line was an array, there would be more than 'k' slots/positions between any two point. Well that, or an expression for the mean minimum distance (MMD) for a pair of points in the set - referring to the smallest distance between any two points that can be found, not the mean minimum/shortest distance between all possible pairs of points. I was unable to find an answer to this question after a literature search, so I was hoping someone here might have an answer or point me in the right direction with a reference. This is for recreational purposes, but maybe someone will find it interesting. If not, apologies for the spam. 

A point which is perhaps worthwile of explicite mention is that the symmetric group (where we consider only the subgroup of all elements with finite support if $E$ is infinite) of a set $E$ has two one-dimensional representations. The trivial representation is of course related to the symmetric algebra and the signature representation corresponds to the exterior algebra. 

Yves Colin de Verdi`ere's work non the $\mu-$invariant of graphs was motivated by discretizing Schr\"odinger operators on surfaces (endowed with Riemannian metrics). His papers (mainly in French but probably largely readable by somebody speaking English) on the subject might therefore be interesting to you, see for example his book "Spectres de graphe", Cours Spécialisés, 4. Société Mathématique de France, Paris, 1998. viii+114 pp. 

I do not see the interest of introducing $r$. The number of shortest paths from $s$ to $t$ passing through $r$ is the product of the number of shortest paths from $s$ to $r$ times the number of shortest paths from $r$ to $t$ if $d(s,t)=d(s,r)+d(r,t)$ and is zero otherwise. It is thus enough to have formulae for the number of shortest paths between two given vertices $x,y$. This number is of course the coefficient with indices $x,y$ in $A^d$ where $d$ is the distance between $x$ and $y$ and where $A$ is the adjacency matrix (and $d$ is also defined as smallest natural integer such that the coefficient with indices $x,y$ in $A^d$ is non-zero). 

The answer for either of these is "hundreds of millions of years" due to their emergence/use in biological development programs, the self-assembly of symmetrical viral capsids (the adenovirus for example), and maybe even protein structure. Because of their close relationship I'd be hard pressed to say which 'came first'. If you google for it, you'll find plenty of books and papers. However, be extremely careful about examples without a well-explained functional role... there are an arbitrarily large number of coincidences out there if you're looking for them, and humans excel at numerology. 

While the general problem of detecting a Hamiltonian path or cycle on an undirected grid graph is known to be NP-complete, are there interesting special cases where efficient polynomial time algorithms exist for enumerating all such paths/cycles? Perhaps for certain kinds of k-ary n-cube graphs? I hope this question isn't too open-ended... Update - Is the problem of iterating Hamiltonian path/circuits known to be NP-complete for the N-cube?
