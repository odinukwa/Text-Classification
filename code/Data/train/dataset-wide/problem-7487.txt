The definition of a fibration by Serre is by far my favorite example. There, if I recall correctly, leaders in the field were actively looking for the right definition and knew that it would "quickly lead to the lifting property." Serre's definition was the lifting property - "quickly" became in no time, by definition! (Sorry, I don't recall and now can't find the exact reference for that approximate quote.)

Brown Representability combined with the Landweber Exact Functor theorem allows one to construct homotopy types out of purely algebro-geometric data, and is in particular the starting point for theories such as that of topological modular forms. Thus, this old theorem underlies one of the key themes which modern algebraic topology is fleshing out. 

It is standard to construct numbers associated to a linear transformation $f: V \to V$ of a finite-dimensional vector space which are invariant under change of basis. The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are such, and it is quite simple to see for example that the trace is invariant by equating it with the map which takes $\sum v_i \otimes w_i \in V \otimes V^* \cong Hom(V, V)$ and then evaluates $\sum w_i(v_i)$. My question is: can one explicitly associate quantities to maps $V \to V \otimes V$ which are invariant under change of basis? A simple dimension count indicates there should be plenty of invariants, since the orbits will have dimension roughly $d^3 - d^2$, where $d$ is the dimension of $V$, but I have yet to construct a single one. 

On a closed, oriented manifold, homology and cohomology are represented by similar objects, but their variance is different and there is an important change in degrees. For simplicity, consider homology or cohomology classes represented by submanifolds. Then if $f : M \to N$ is a smooth map between manifolds of dimension $m$ and $n$ respectively and $W$ is a submanifold of $M$ representing a homology class then $f(M)$ represented (really, $f_*([M])$ is) a homology class of $N$, in the same dimension. On the other hand, if $V$ is a submanifold of $N$, then we can consider $f^{-1}(V)$, which is a manifold if $f$ is transverse to $F$. Its codimension is the same as that of $V$ (that is, $n - dim(V) = m - dim(f^{-1}(V))$). Note that this preimage is generically at least as "nice" as $V$ (smooth is $V$ is, with reasonable singularities if $V$ has, etc.) whereas little can be said about the geometry of $f(W)$. That's one reason I think that cohomology is of more use in algebraic geometry. If you want to relate this view of cohomology to the standard one, a codimension $d$ submanifold of $M$ (that is, one of dimension $m-d$) generically intersects a dimension $d$ one in a finite number of points which can be counted with signs. The former defines a class in $H^d(M)$ while the latter a class in $H_d(M)$, and this intersection count is evaluation of cohomology on homology. This point of view is more applicable than it might seem since in a manifold with boundary cohomology classes are similarly defined by submanifolds whose boundary lies on the boundary of the ambient manifold. Since any finite CW complex is homotopy equivalent to a manifold with boundary, one can view cohomology in this way for finite CW complexes and often infinite ones as well. 

Let $X$ be a finite (CW or simplicial - doesn't matter) complex and consider the space of all compact subspaces of $R^\infty$ which are homotopy equivalent to $X$, topologized say as a subspace of the space of all compact subspaces of $R^\infty$ with the Hausdorff metric. What is known about this space? I vaguely recall that it is related to Waldhausen's $A$-theory - are there any references for that? Motivation: if one instead looks at the space of all subspaces homeomorphic to or respectively diffeomorphic (if $X$ is a manifold) to $X$ one has a model for $BHomeo(X)$ or $BDiff(X)$ (since the corresponding space of embeddings of $X$ in $R^\infty$ is weakly contractible and this space is the quotient of the space of embeddings by the homeo/diffeo group). I have been having fun lately thinking about these models when $X$ is a finite set of points or a surface. This space of subspaces homotopy equivalent to $X$ is different - in particular I do not see it (directly anyways) as a model for $BHomotopySelfEquiv(X)$ - so I'd like to know more what is known about it. 

First of all, we may forget about translations, since they just shift the convex combinations. Thus we may regard the direct similarity as a linear transform given by an orthogonal matrix $A$ multiplied by some constant $\alpha$. Then the transform mapping the otiginal polytope to the convex combination is given by $$ B=\lambda I+(1-\lambda)\alpha A. $$ This is also a linear transform, so the image of a parallelotope is also a parallelotope (if the transform is non-degenerate; notice that it may be degenerate only if $\lambda=\pm(1-\lambda)\alpha$ since the complex eigenvalues of $A$ have unital absolute values; in this case $A$ should have eigenvalue $\pm 1$, and this may happen even in the planar case). This answers Q2. As for Q1 (and Q3), we need to check whether $B$ is an orthogonal matrix multiplied by a real number $c$ (provided that the polytope is solid). This is the case iff all eigenvalues of $B$ have the same absolute value, which reduces to the following two options: 1) All eigenvalues of $A$ coincide (thus $A$ is scalar, and the transform is a scaling); or 2) All the eigenvalues of $A$ are $e^{\pm i\theta}$ for some fixed $\theta$ (surely these two eigenvalues coinciding multiplicities). Thus $A$ acts as a composition of rotations in $d/2$ mutually orthogonal planes. This case cannot happen in odd-dimensional space (which answers Q3), but it sometimes happens in all even-dimensional spaces. The phenomenon of the planar case is that for the plane there are no more options. 

Let me estimate the number $N_k$ of such bases for a fixed $k$. Aside remark. The number of bases for $k=k_0$ equals the number of those for $k=n-k_0$, as the bijection $(\beta_0,\dots,\beta_{n-1})\to (\beta_{n-1},\dots,\beta_{k_0},h^{-1}\beta_{k_0-1},\dots,h^{-1}\beta_0)$$ shows. So let us fix any $k$. The first $k$ elements can be chosen in $\prod_{i=0}^{k-1}(q^n-q^i)$ many ways. Each next element $\beta_i$ should lie outside $V_i=\langle \beta_0,\dots,\beta_{i-1}\rangle$, as well as outside $V_i'=\langle h^{-1}\beta_0,\dots,h^{-1}\beta_{k-1},\beta_k,\dots,\beta_{i-1}\rangle$. If $d_i=\dim(V_i\cap V_i')$, then $\beta_i$ can be chosen in $q^n-2q^i+q^{d_i}$ many ways; notice that $i\geq d_i\geq \max(i-k,2i-n)$. Thus $$ N_k\geq \prod_{i=0}^{k-1}(q^n-q^i)\prod_{i=k}^{n-1}(q^n-2q^i+q^{\max(i-k,2i-n)}). $$ This estimate can be improved by noticing that $d_i\geq d_{i-1}+1$. So, e.g., for $k=1$, if we choose $\beta_1=(h^{-1}+1)\beta_0$, then $V_2=V_2'$, so $d_i=i$ for $i\geq 2$. But it seems appropriate to choose large $k$... Notice that for $k=n-1$, the estimate gives $$ N_{n-1}\geq (q^n-2q^{n-1}+q^{n-2}).\prod_{i=0}^{n-2}(q^n-q^i), $$ which is $1-\frac1q$ of all bases. Do you need much sharper bounds? 

These restrictions yield that black cells group into clusters fitting into $n\times n$ squares, and such clusters are sufficiently far apart. 

$\let\eps\epsilon$1. There is no such way independent of $n$. Indeed, assume that for some suitable small $\eps$ there exist $\eps'<1/10$ and $\delta<1/2$. For $n=1/\eps^2$ let your set of points be $\{0,\eps\}^n$, and distribute $p_{i,j}$ uniformly over the edges of the cube. We claim that no desired clustering is possible. Indeed, consider any cluster; wlog, it contains $0$. Now we compare the number of edges inside it with the number of edges from it to the outside; we claim that the ratio of these two numbers is at most, say, $1/10$. Notice that the weight (i.e. the number of coordinates equal to $\eps$) of each point in the cluster is at most $n/100$. Let us reconstruct our cluster starting from $0$ and adding the points one by one in non-decreasing order of weights. Each time we add a point, we remove at most $n/100$ edges going outside (the ones from the new point to the previously added), add at most $n/100$ edges inside (the same ones), and add at least, say, $98n/100$ edges going outside (the ones from the new point to the points with greater weights). Thus at each step the estimate is confirmed. Therefore, the total number of edges inside the clusters is not greater than $1/5$ times the number of other edges, and we failed to clusterize the points in a required manner. 2. On the other hand, if we fix the dimension $n$, then the claim holds, even if the diameter 1 condition is omitted. Indeed, one may choose randomly the orthonormal base and dissect the whole space by hyperplanes into cubes of side $\eps'/\sqrt{n}$ (the offsets are also chosen uniformly random). The clusters will be the sets in one cube. Indeed, each segment of length $\leq\eps$ will be crossed by a hyperplane of fixed direction with probability of order $\eps/\eps'$ (sorry, I omit the computations right now), so at average the sum of $p_{i,j}$ over the small crossed segments $P_iP_j$ will be small (if we choose an appropriate $\eps'/\eps$). 

I am going to give a topologically biased answer, which will proceed by restating what the Index Theorem says so that its plausibility (though not its truth) is more immediate. [Oops - I see that Paul Siegel said much of this in the comments following his answer - oh well.] 

Here's how I explain Steenrod squares to geometers. First, if $X$ is a manifold of dimension $d$ then one can produce classes in $H^n(X)$ by proper maps $f: V \to X$ where $V$ is a manifold of dimension $d-n$ through many possible formalisms - eg. intersection theory (the value on a transverse $n$-cycle is the count of intersection points), or using the fundamental class in locally finite homology and duality, or Thom classes, or as the pushforward $ f_*(1)$ where $1$ is the unit class in $H^0(V)$. Taking this last approach, suppose $f$ is an immersion and thus has a normal bundle $\nu$. If $x = f_*(1) \in H^n(X)$ then $Sq^i(x) = f_*(w_i(\nu))$. This is essentially the Wu formula. That is, if cohomology classes are represented by submanifolds, and for example cup product reflects intersection data, then Steenrod squares remember normal bundle data. 

I am looking for a reference for the following fact which must be classical (which makes it harder, for me, to track a reference down). I am interested because there are similar (more complicated) statements about the cohomology of symmetric groups. If $P$ is a partition, namely $p_{1} + \cdots + p_{k} = n$, we let $\rho_{P}$ denote the permutation representation of $S_{n}$, induced up from the trivial representation of $S_{P}$. If $P$ and $Q$ are partitions of $n$ then consider any matrix $\hat{A}$ with nonnegative integer entries such that the entries of $i$th row of $A$ add up to $p_{i}$ and those of the $j$th column of $A$ add up to $q_{j}$. Then the entries of $\hat{A}$ form another partition of $n$, which we call $A$ and say that $A$ is a product-refinement of $P$ and $Q$. For example if $P = Q = 1 + 2$ then two possibilities for $\hat{A}$ are $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. Proposition: If $\rho_{P}$ and $\rho_{Q}$ are permutation representations of $S_n$ then $\rho_{P} \otimes \rho_{Q} \cong \bigoplus_{A} \rho_{A},$ where the sum is over $A$ which are product-refinements of $P$ and $Q$. Questions: 1) what is the reference for this fact? and 2) what is standard terminology (for product-refinement in particular)? 

Bott and Tu do this completely, in the de Rham theoretic setting of course. Here's an alternate proof I plan to use in singular theory next time I teach this material, which I find slightly more direct than using Thom classes (which require the tubular neighborhood theorem, etc): Definition: Given a collection $S = \{W_i\}$ of submanifolds of a manifold $X$, define the smooth chain complex transverse to $S$, denoted ${C^S}_*(X)$, by using the subgroups of the singular chain groups in which the basis chains $\Delta^n \to X$ are smooth and transverse to all of the $W_i$. Lemma: The inclusion ${C^S}_*(X) \to C_*(X)$ is a quasi-isomorophism, for any such collection $S$. Now if $W \in S$ then "count of intersection with $W$" gives a perfectly well-defined element $\tau_W$ of ${\rm Hom}(C^S_*(X), A)$ and thus by this quasi-isomorphism a well-defined cocycle if the $W$ is proper and has no boundary. It is immediate that this cocycle evaluates on cycles which are represented by closed submanifolds through intersection count. It is also not hard (but takes a bit to work out all the details) to show that the cup product of these cochains (when the submanifolds intersect transversally) is given by the intersection class of their intersection - we compute on the chains which intersect all of $W$, $V$ and $W \cap V$ transversally and reduce to linear settings. Consider for example $W$ the $x$-axis in the plane, $V$ with $y$-axis, and then various $2$-simplices can contain the origin (or not) and have various faces which intersect the axes (or not) all consistent with the formula for cup product.
