Here's what's going on here. Take a toda flow in 3 variables. The equations of motion are: $$\frac{d}{dt}a_k=2(b_k^2-b_{k-1}^2),$$ $$\frac{d}{dt}b_k=b_k(a_{k+1}-a_k),$$ where $a_i,b_i>0$, which can be represented as a commutator involving the matrix $L(a,b)$, which is a tridiagonal matrix with $a_i$ on the diagonal and $b_i$ on the superdiagonals. The hexagon above incorporates the following phenomenon of the Toda flow of $L(a,b)$: 

Let $G(n,p)$ be the usual random graph on $n$ vertices with each edge existing independently with probability $p$ (no self loops , or double edges not are allowed). I would like to simulate the distribution of a random graph given the event $T\geq a$ where $T$ is the number of triangles in the random graph. The natural approach is Metropolis Hastings. I've already found some semi-efficient algorithms that approximate the number of triangles in a given random graph, however I am still at a loss of what Markov chain to pick for a good rate of convergence. I would immensely appreciate a push in the right direction. In particular, some references would be fantastic. Thanks! 

Fix a partition $\lambda$. A weak reverse plane partition of shape $\lambda$ is a filling $0\leq \pi_{ij}$ of $\lambda$ with $\pi_{ij}\leq \pi_{kl}$ whenever $i\leq k$ or $j\leq l$. Note that $\pi_{ij}=0$ is allowed. We say a plane partition is $k$-bounded if $\pi_{ij}\leq k$ for all $i,j$. 

As far as I'm aware, the most current in-depth book reference on SLE is Greg Lawler's book Conformally Invariant Processes in the Plane, a PDF of which is available here. From experience, SLE theory is extremely hard to grasp without a global understanding of what's going on, both on the complex analysis side and the probability side, in addition to its applications. There's also a set of lecture notes from the PIMS summer school, more in the context of self-avoiding-walks. 

Bob and Alice want to marry each other, so Bob decides to send Alice a ring. The problem is that they both live in different countries, and any valuables they send through the mail are sure to be stolen, unless they are sent in a locked box. The box can be locked by a padlock which can only be opened by the right key. Both Alice and Bob have an infinite supply of boxes and padlocks with corresponding keys. However, neither Alice nor Bob have keys to each other's padlocks, only for their own. Suppose you can put boxes inside each other. How can Bob send Alice the ring? Of course, the solution to the problem must end with Alice putting the ring on her finger. To reiterate, anything outside of a padlocked box is guaranteed to be stolen. This problem has numerous solutions as well as interpretations which makes for a fun discussion. It can also be solved in your head without pencil or paper. 

Here's something that keeps me up at night: During the Russian revolution, there is a story of a mathematician (I've heard Igor Tamm may be the one) who was mistaken by rebels to be a communist spy. He was promptly captured by a local gang and interrogated. When he said that he is a mathematician, the gang leader asked him to back up his claim by deriving the formula for the Taylor Remainder Theorem. He was warned that if he failed, he would be shot on the spot. After some sweating the mathematician finally derived the result. The gang leader was satisfied with the proof and let him go. 

The usual branching rule says that $$f_\lambda=\sum_{\mu\rightarrow\lambda}f_\mu,$$ where the sum is taken over all partitions $\mu$ of $n-1$ that are contained ($\rightarrow$) in $\lambda$. It is easy to see that when $(i,j)$ is a corner box, $N_{ij}(n)=f_{\lambda- (i,j)}$, the number of SYT of shape $\lambda$ minus the corner box in question. This kind of reasoning can be extended to $N_{ij}(n-1),N(n-2)$. Unfortunately, $N_{ij}(n-k)$ becomes exceeding difficult to compute for $k>2$. I would like to ask what is known about $N_{ij}(k)$, when $(i,j)$ is a corner box. Specifically, are there any recurrences that these satisfy? Are they at all related to coefficients of certain weighted hook-walk algorithms? Have they been considered in any enumeration problems? Does this question have an answer for certain fixed nontrivial shapes $\lambda$? 

For a partition $\lambda=(\lambda_1\geq \lambda_2\geq\ldots\geq \lambda_k)$ of $n$, let the set of standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda$ be denoted by $SYT(\lambda)$ with boxes at $(i,j)$ denoted by $B_{ij}$ taking in distinct values in $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Also let $f_\lambda:=|SYT(\lambda)|$. Finally, let $N_{ij}(k)$ be the set of young tableau of shape $\lambda$ with $B_{ij}=k$. We will exclusively be talking about boxes on the right edge of the Young tableaux (boxes that have no boxes directly south or east of them). We will call these corner boxes. In the diagram below, 8,9 and 10 are corner boxes. On the other hand, 5 and 6 are not corners. 

There's a nice reference here: Ordinary Differential equations and the Symmetric Eigenvalue Problem by Deift, Nanda and Tomei which generalizes the above result by interpreting the Toda flow on a permutahedron whose vertices are indexed by permutations of the eigenvalues of the flow (they correspond to diagonal matrices where the eigenvalues ordered on the diagonal). Specifically, all non-degenerate (non-diagonal) initial conditions flow to the diagonal matrix of its eigenvalues, where the ordering of eigenvalues is determined initially by the size of the first component of the normalized eigenvectors. A really cute way of thinking about this is to think of the Toda flow as a continous-time version of eigenvalue iteration algorithms such as QR, Lanczos, or Householder iteration. 

Let $S_n$ be the symmetric group. Let $s_i$ denote the adjacent transposition $(i \ i+1)$. For any permutation $w\in S_n$, an expression $w=s_{i_1}s_{i_2}\cdots s_{i_p}$ of minimal possible length is called a reduced decomposition of $w$, where $p=\ell(w)$, the length of $w$ (number of inversions). For any function $f=f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ and $w\in S_n$, define $wf:=f(x_{w^{-1}(1)},\ldots,x_{w^{-1}(n)})$ and define the divided difference operator $\partial_i$ via $\partial_i f:=\frac{f-s_if}{x_i-x_{i+1}}$. The Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak{G}_w$ are defined as follows: $\mathfrak{G}_w:=\partial_{w^{-1}w_0}x^\delta$, where $w_0$ is the longest element of $S_n$, given by $w_0(i)=n+1-i$ and $x^\delta:=x_1^{n-1}x_2^{n-2}\cdots x_{n-1}$. There are correspondingly double Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak{G}(x,y)$, which are defined through $\mathfrak{G}_w(x,y)=\partial_{w^{-1}w_0}\prod_{i+j\leq n}(x_i-y_j)$. On the other hand, quantum Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak{G}^q_w$ are defined by Fomin, Gelfand, and Postnikov in this paper (see Theorem 1.1) and by Kirillov in this paper as well. Roughly speaking, one expands the usual Schubert polynomials in terms of elementary polynomials and then replaces each elementary polynomial with a deformed quantum elementary polynomial. See (1.3) and (1.4) of the above link for further details. There are correspondingly double quantum Schubert polynomials $\mathfrak{G}(x,y)$ Here is slightly more background: In their paper on the Nil-Coxeter algebra and Schubert Polynomials, Fomin and Stanley present a beautiful construction of Schubert polynomials using operators $A_i(x)$ which are defined on the so called Nil-Coxeter Algebra. You first define the Nil-Coxeter algebra via the generators $$u_i^2=0$$ $$u_iu_j=u_ju_i, \ \ \ |i-j|\geq 2$$ $$u_iu_{i+1}u_i=u_{i+1}u_iu_{i+1}$$ and then the operators $A_i(x):=(I+xu_{n-1})(I+xu_{n-2})\cdots (I+xu_i)$ from which one can show that $G_w(x_1,\ldots,x_n):=A_1(x_1)A_2(x_2)\cdots A_{n-1}(x_{n-1})$ correspond naturally to the usual Schubert polynomials above when one projects $G_w$ onto $w$. FIRST QUESTION: Is there any hope for generalizing the operators $A_i(x)$ to something akin to $A_i^q(x)$ or similar in hopes of writing quantum Schubert polynomials in the form $G_w^q=A^q_1(x_1)\cdots A^q_{n-1}(x_{n-1})$? Note that in their definition, quantum Schubert polynomials actually have $n-1$ $q_i$ terms. SECOND QUESTION: Purely in terms of reduced decompositions (and not anything related to quantum cohomology, Schubert varieties or Gromov-Witten invariants), what exactly do quantum Schubert polynomials count? It's well known that Schubert polynomials and their infinite relatives can be used for example to count the number of reduced words of a permutation $w\in S_n$. The infinite Schubert polynomial $G_w(x)=A_1(x_1)A_1(x_2)\cdots$ projected onto $w$ corresponds exactly to the Stanley Symmetric function: $$G_w(x)=\sum_{(s_1,\cdots,s_p)\in R(w)}\sum_{\overset{\overset{b_1\cdots, b_p}{1\leq b_1\leq\cdots \leq b_p}}{s_i<s_{i+1}\Rightarrow b_i<b_{i+1}}}x_{b_1}\cdots x_{b_p}$$ where $R(w)$ is the set of all reduced decompositions of $w$. Then we have the famous result $|R(w)|=[x_1\cdots x_p]G_w(x)=\sum_{\lambda\vdash p}\alpha_{w\lambda}[x_1\cdots x_p]s_\lambda==\sum_{\lambda\vdash p}\alpha_{w\lambda}f^\lambda$, where $\lambda$ are standard Young tableau, $f^\lambda$ is the number of standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda$ and $s_\lambda$ are Schur polynomials. The $\alpha_{w\lambda}$ coefficients have a combinatorial interpretation due to Fomin and Greene: they count the number of Semistandard Young Tableau of shape $\lambda$ such that the row-read word is a reduced decomposition for $w$. It seems to me that in the quantum version, one gets quantum Schur polynomials instead, with quantum $\alpha_{w\lambda}$ but this is as far as I can see. What would the $\alpha^q_{\lambda w}$ count in the quantum case? Here is another interpretation. In their paper on the Yang Baxter equation and Schubert Polynomials, Fomin and Kirillov show that Schubert polynomials can be constructed by looking at braid relations on wiring diagrams (see for example Fig 10, pg 134). In this way, how do quantum Schubert polynomials count such generalized configurations? More importantly, what do the weights $q_i$ contribute to the counts? Here is an example: for $w=321$, the double Schubert polynomial can be written as $$\mathfrak{G}_w(x,y)=(x_1-y_2)(x_1-y_1)(x_2-y_1)$$ which has the interpretation that we assign weights $x_i,y_i$ to the threads (pseudolines) of any reduced decomposition of $w$ and thus we are explicitly showing which lines cross at a given time. The quantum version is $$\mathfrak{G}^q_w(x,y)=(x_1-y_2)(x_1-y_1)(x_2-y_1)+q_1(x_1-y_2)$$. What exactly is this $q_1$ counting? 

Cramer's decomposition theorem states that if $X$ and $Y$ are independent real random variables and $X+Y$ has normal distribution, then both $X$ and $Y$ are normally distributed. I've seen a few proofs of this result which involve grunt work in the realm of complex analysis. I was wondering if there is an intuitive proof of this result. I would like to see a proof that exploits the unique nature of the normal distribution. For example, can one derive the result from the fact that on the real line, the normal distribution maximizes entropy for a given mean and standard deviation? Edit: The complex analysis proof I'm thinking of uses the fact that if $E[\exp(\alpha X^2)]<\infty$ for some $\alpha>0$ and the analytic continuation of the characteristic function of $X$ is nonzero, then $X$ is normally distributed. 

I think the main issue you'll encounter with scaling limits and conformal invariance will be that it is a very new subject. Many of the papers will be very high level or still in preprint with details missing. Here's a list of references that helped me learn the subject. I'll try to comment on some of them later on when time permits. I would first start with "Scaling Limits and SLE" by Greg Lawler. This set of notes is in context of self avoiding walks and how they connect to SLE and you'll find they quickly dive into scale invariance and conformal invariance. If you are further interested in proofs, I would consult Lawler's "Conformally Invariant Processes in the Plane." This book gives very rigorous formulations of SLE and tackles a myriad of technical difficulties. Next I would look at "Toward conformal invariance of 2D lattice models" by Smirnov. Here you'll be introduced to the notion of the duality between holomorphic martingales and scale invariance. In particular, you need to understand how discrete complex analysis connects with conformal invariance. I would hold out for proofs of many of the results for now. Now you'll probably want to look at some simpler examples. I would first start trying to understand the proof of Cardy's Formula. Geoffrey Grimmett has an excellent set of lecture notes, "Probability on Graphs" which should be available off Grimmett's website (I can't seem to access it right now). As well I would consult the original paper by Smirnov, "Critical percolation in the plane". I'll add here that the proof of Cardy's formula doesn't need the full machinery of holomorphic martingales because of the really nice symmetries Smirnov observed. What IS important though is how the Riemann Hilbert boundary conditions are set up. One of the big issues with discrete complex analysis is how to rigorously define discrete holomorphic functions on graphs. If you want the gory details, "Discrete complex analysis on isoradial graphs" by Chelkak and Smirnov is a good place to look. 

While doing laundry at my local laundromat, I saw a coin pusher game. Below is a picture, and here is a video depicting how it works (disregard non-coins). alt text $URL$ Essentially, one has a distribution of coins on a table, and you get to drop one coin at a time at one end, which ends up being pushed into the table, thereby potentially pushing coins off the edge. Note that you can choose where you can drop your coin, width wise. For simplicity, assume coins cannot stack on each other. My question is, are there known limit laws for this game? That is, if I specify a distribution of coins on the table, and then start dropping coins in randomly, what can be said about how the expected number of dropped coins fluctuates, per turn. Consequently, are there various phase transitions as a function of coin density? As well, if I feed coins at a specific spot, what will the distribution of coin falls look like as a function of the table width? Do the boundary conditions (the side walls and the pusher) create interesting "modes" in the coin falling distribution? I would think that this has to do with sand stacking cascades and KPZ growth but, do not have much experience in this area. Or perhaps this is just a simple Galton box that produces a normal distribution? 

For example, can we look at the limit of the winding number around an annulus about point $b$ whose radius shrinks to zero? I would imagine we would require the Brownian motion to be conditioned to hit some region of positive area just outside the shrinking annulus. 

These are the Coxeter relations, and I believe equivalence comes from a general theorem: Tit's Theorem. For example, if you are willing to accept the Edelemann-Greene correspondence between Young Tableau and reduced words of permutations, then it would be equivalent to show that one can move freely between two reduced words using the above relations (now correspondingly, $d_i$ act on permutations via adjacent transpositions: $d_i(i,i+1)=(i+1,i)$. You can find a proof of reduced word equivalence here, page 4, Theorem 1.1.2. Essentially, the proof for tableaux should be of the same flavor: show that you can pass from any word to a carefully chosen canonical word. 

Lights Out is a game which has effectively been reduced to a problem in linear algebra, particularly a routine exercise in Gaussian elimination. A good link can be found here. What's particularly interesting is the fact that operations in the game commute, which allows for the linear algebra approach. I wonder if there are any non-commutative turn based games which can also be solved mathematically? Certainly, chess is out of the question! 

I'm aware of numerous results in combinatorics where $F_1$ comes up in. For example, the fluctations of random aztec diamond tilings follow an Airy process and therefore have GOE behavior. There the scaling is $n^{1/3}$. As well, it comes up in viscous walkers and nonintersecting brownian motion. I mention these examples because there are definitely tangentially linked to $S_n$ through representation theory and growth processes. However, as I said I would ideally like an example of something that naturally occurs on $S_n$. 

I am interested in a probabilistic proof of this. The proof that I know is of a spectral nature: Define $\langle f,g\rangle:= \sum_{X\in\mathbb{Z}^d} \pi(x)f(x)g(x)$, where $\pi(x)$ is the stationary measure. This gives an inner product on $L^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. In the case of a random conductance model, $\pi(x)$ would be the sum of random edge weights at $x$.  Then $P^{2k}(0,0)=\langle \delta_0,P^{2k}\delta_0\rangle$, and since $P$ is self adjoint with $\|P\|_2\leq 1$, the desired result follows.  I have tried various approaches such as conditioning on the hitting times of the origin and as well trying to prove the result by induction. I would like to see a proof that showcases a probabilistic argument. For example, is it possible to show the result from the machinery of evolving sets of Morris and Peres? 

Some other probability PDE techniques: 1) Percolation: The Aizenman Barsky proof of exponential decay in subcritical percolation hinged on establishing a number of differential inequalities. 2) Conformal Invariance and SLE: Many conformal invariance proofs reduce to showing that the discrete stochastic process in question satisfies a Riemann Hilbert boundary value problem along with defining a flow on the state space which is divergence and curl free. This makes it clear how Cardy's formula arises as the hypergeometric function which solves the appropriate differential equation. 

For a straightforward and quick intro to the standard model, try "Groups and Symmetries: From Finite Groups to Lie Groups" by Kosmann-Schwarzbach. It's rigorous and does a good job motivating the standard model in its later chapters. You'll learn what a quark is from the mathematical point of view. In addition, Griffith's textbook on elementary particle physics would be a good historical supplement. It took physicists many years and guesses to work out the standard model. The first few chapter of Griffith's book read like a good mystery novel. Plus, you'll be a little more familiar with weird concepts like isospin, strangeness and color. Finally, for more talk related to particle physics the classic text "Quarks and Leptons" by Halzen and Martin is really in-depth, but does assume a good grasp on physics. It does a good job of explaining concepts in the context of group theory. I would say, try to read the discussions in it rather then get bogged down in the physics.
