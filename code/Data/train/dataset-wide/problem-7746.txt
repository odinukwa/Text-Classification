For $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}_n$ and $\rho$ a symmetric power you can have a look at this article by Bedratyuk published in Lin. Multlin. Algebra. It has a formula for the multiplicity of the trivial representation but it is quite scary. 

For a less abstract and more computational approach you can for instance look at Example 5.48 in the book "Introduction a la resolution des systemes polynomiaux" by Elkadi and Mourrain (in French). It gives the resultant of three conics as the determinant of an explicit matrix. Apply this to the partial derivatives of your cubic and you will get the discriminant. The method goes back to Sylvester. Also, if you have JSTOR access and don't mind reading rather old fashioned algebra, you can look at this paper by Morley. 

Edit: the above is good for a very light introduction. But in order to go further into probability theory on spaces like $\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{S}',\mathcal{D},\mathcal{D}', \oplus_{\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{R}, \prod_{\mathbb{N}}\mathbb{R}$, etc. I think the best reference is the article "Processus linéaires, processus généralisés" by Fernique. I have also seen references to a book by Dalecky and Fomin, but I don't have access to a copy. 

There is a very interesting book which appeared recently precisely on this topic: "The Riemann Hypothesis for Function Fields" by Machiel van Frankenhuijsen. His attempt at answering the OP's question about what is missing is in the last two chapters. My impression is that Connes' work on RH, like that of great painters such as Picasso, can be divided into different periods. I would say the first period is about exploring connections to statistical mechanics and the notion of symmetry breaking. The main result is his article with Bost on the now called Bost-Connes system. However, this did not yet contain an approach towards RH. The second period is that of his Selecta paper with the trace formula. Finally the third period involves having "fun with $\mathbb{F}_1$", hyperreals, toposes, etc. The third period is about constructing suitable objects which would allow one to mimic Weil's proof. I am not familiar with this last development, but I think Will did a good job at explaining what is missing regarding the approach from this third period. The book I mentioned and the little I know concern the second period. Let me first give a general somewhat vague opinion: if one has a reasonably clear description of what $A$ and $B$ are, then it is easier to prove a conjecture which says $A=B$ than one which says $A\neq B$ (or $A>B$, $A\ge B$, etc.). For example, I think the recent work by Kronheimer and Mrowka is significant progress on the four-color theorem. The latter says $A>B$ where $B=0$ and $A$ is the number of Tait colorings. They produced some invariant $C$ which they showed satisfies $C>B$ and reduced the problem to the conjecture $A=C$. Connes' Selecta article reduced Weil positivity (an $A\ge B$ type problem) and thus RH to an $A=B$ type problem, i.e., proving his global trace formula which is formally similar to a theorem of Guillemin and Sternberg for flows on Riemannian manifolds. He also proved the semi-local analogue of his formula. Take a finite group $G$ with a unitary representation $U$ and consider the matrix ${\rm tr}(U(gh^{-1}))$ with rows and columns indexed by $g,h\in G$. This matrix is positive semidefinite. Weil positivity follows from Connes' global trace formula for essentially the same reason. Proving the trace formula, prima facie, looks like a problem of harmonic analysis or even constructive quantum field theory since one has a formally precise but still physicsy looking infinite-dimensional trace to make sense of by introducing UV and IR cutoffs and then analyzing the limit of removing them. There has been follow-ups by Haran (here and here) and Burnol (here and here) but, as far as I know, the trace formula has not been proved in this approach, even in the function field case where at least we know it should be true. 

I am not familiar with spin models in the sense of subfactors, but my guess is the link between the two is conformal quantum field theory. The scaling limit of a critical spin model (in the sense of physics) usually gives a CQFT. On the other hand there is also a correspondence between subfactors and CQFTs. I think there is work by Wassermann for constructing CQFTs out of subfactors. V. Jones also has some conjectures about all subfactors arising from CQFTs in some way. 

Yes one gets the square of the determinant of the matrix where one deletes row j and column k. That follows from Dodgson's condensation formula for determinants. 

Let $G=(V,E)$ be a connected countably infinite $k$-regular simple graph (no loops or multiple edges). For $A$ a finite subset of $V$, let me denote by $G_A=(A,E_A)$ the induced subgraph with vertex set $A$ obtained by only keeping edges with both ends in $A$. Now let me define the (inner) boundary $\partial A$ as the set of vertices in $A$ who have a (neighbor for $G$) outside $A$. This is the same as the vertices with a defect of regularity, i.e., whose degree relative to $G_A$ is $<k$. Let me now define a completion $\overline{G_A}$ to be a graph with vertex set $A$ obtained from $G_A$ by adding some edges between elements of $\partial A$ while keeping vertex degrees $\le k$. Given a vertex $v$, a finite set $A$ containing $v$ and a number $c\in (0,1]$, let me say that $v$ is $c$-movable in $A$ if there exists a completion $\overline{G_A}$ of $G_A$ such that the orbit of $v$ for the action of ${\rm Aut}(\overline{G_A})$ has size $\ge c\times |A|$. Here ${\rm Aut}(\overline{G_A})$ is of course the automorphism group of the graph $\overline{G_A}$, and $|A|$ denotes the cardinality of $A$. I would like to call $G$ a periodizable graph if it satisfies the following property: For every $v\in V$ there is a constant $c_v\in (0,1]$ and an increasing sequence $A_n$ of finite sets containing $v$ such that $\cup A_n=V$ and such that, for every $n$, $v$ is $c_v$-movable in $A_n$. 

You can spare yourself the functional analytic abstract nonsense by using an explicit set of seminorms on $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^d)=C_{c}^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ which, unfortunately, are not well-known but can be found in the excellent book "Topological Vector Spaces and Distributions" by Horváth on p.171. Let $\mathbb{N}=\{0,1,\ldots\}$, and denote the set of multiindices by $\mathbb{N}^d$. A locally finite family $\theta=(\theta_{\alpha})_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^d}$ of continous functions $\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is one such that for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ there is a neighborhood $V$ such that $V\cap {\rm Supp}\ \theta_{\alpha}=\emptyset$ for all but finitely many $\alpha$'s. Let $$ ||f||_{\theta}=\sup_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}^d}\sup_{x\in\mathbb{R}^d} |\theta_{\alpha}(x)D^{\alpha}f(x)|\ , $$ then the seminorms $||\cdot||_{\theta}$ where $\theta$ runs over all such locally finite families define the topology of $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. All you have to do is show that for every $\theta$, there exists $\theta'$ and $\theta''$ such that $$ ||fg||_{\theta}\le ||f||_{\theta'}||g||_{\theta''} $$ for all test functions $f$ and $g$, which one can do by hand. For instance, you can use the Leibniz or product rule $$ D^{\alpha}(fg)=\sum_{\beta+\gamma=\alpha}\frac{\alpha!}{\beta!\gamma!} D^{\beta}f D^{\gamma}g\ , $$ and the brutal $l^1$-$l^{\infty}$ estimate $$ |D^{\alpha}(fg)|\le \prod_{i=1}^{d}(\alpha_i+1) \times\max_{\beta+\gamma=\alpha} \frac{\alpha!}{\beta!\gamma!} |D^{\beta}f| |D^{\gamma}g|\ , $$ in order to see that $\theta'=\theta''$ works if it is defined by $$ \theta'_{\beta}(x):=\frac{1}{\beta!} \sup_{\alpha\ge \beta} \sqrt{\prod_{i=1}^{d}(\alpha_i+1)!}\times\sqrt{|\theta_{\alpha}(x)|}\ . $$ 

Just an elaboration on the comments by nfdc23 and KConrad. I think differences between conventions 1 and 3 or the one mentioned by Alexander of putting $\frac{1}{2\pi}$ in front of the direct transform are just a matter of taste, but convention 2 stands out. If instead of $\mathbb{R}$ you work on the field of $p$-adic numbers, $\mathbb{Q}_p$ then the standard Fourier transform is $$ \widehat{f}(\xi)=\int_{\mathbb{Q}_p} e^{-2i\pi\{\xi x\}_p}\ f(x)\ dx $$ where $\xi x$ is just the product of the two $p$-adic numbers and $\{\cdots\}_p$ is the polar part defined as follows. An element $x\in\mathbb{Q}_p$ has unique convergent series representation as $$ x=\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} a_n p^n $$ where the "digits" $a_n$ belong to $\{0,1,\ldots,p-1\}$ and only finitely many of them are nonzero for negative $n$. Then one sets $$ \{x\}_p=\sum_{n<0} a_n p^n\ . $$ The definition of the Fourier transforms simply reflects the fact $\mathbb{Q}_p$ is its own Pontryagin dual. However, what this abstract statement means concretely is that all additive characters are of the form $x\mapsto e^{-2i\pi\{\xi x\}_p}$ for $\xi\in\mathbb{Q}_p$. I don't know how one would avoid putting the $2\pi$ in the exponential in this context. Since number theorists need to work adelically and combine $\mathbb{R}$ with all the $\mathbb{Q}_p$, it makes sense, if only for esthetic reasons, to treat everybody the same and put the $2\pi$ in the exponential for $\mathbb{R}$ too. Of course, this opens other cans of worms like: what is the missing polar part for $\mathbb{R}$? why isn't $e^{-\pi x^2}$ the indicator function of a subring of $\mathbb{R}$? etc. 

I am surprised no one mentioned the work of Alan Sokal and coworkers on precisely this issue of weighted enumeration of spanning forests which is related to the $q\rightarrow 0$ limit of the Potts model as well as the multivariate Tutte polynomial. A determinant expression corresponds to a Fermionic (Grassmann/Berezin) integral with a quadratic `action' in the exponential. There is an analogue of the matrix-tree theorem for spanning forests with a Fermionic integral with quartic action see: $URL$ which appeared in PRL. Follow ups such as $URL$ can be found by looking at Sokal's papers on arxiv: $URL$ Note that there was a whole semester at the Isaac Newton Institute revolving around this topic: $URL$ One can even watch the videos of the talks. The one perhaps most relevant to this question is the talk by Andrea Sportiello in the fourth workshop. 

The result is true if the pair of random variables $(X,Y)$ is an FKG system: see Lecture 8 from the course given by David Brydges at the 2009 PIMS Probability Summer School. For example if the joint law has density $e^{V(x,y)}$ with $$ \forall x,y,\ \ \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x\partial y}(x,y)\ge 0 $$ then for all increasing functions of two variables $F,G$ one has $$ \mathbb{E} F(X,Y)G(X,Y)\ge \mathbb{E} F(X,Y)\ \mathbb{E} G(X,Y)\ . $$ All you need to do is take $$ F(x,y)=f(x) \ {\rm and}\ G(x,y)=f(y) $$ with your notations. 

Before reading these articles it may helpful to consult the slides of my recent Colloquium talk "A Toy Model for Three-Dimensional Conformal Probability". They should be much easier to follow since they contain lots of pictures. The article in bullet point 1) provides an alternate way of defining pointwise products of random distributions (like $\phi^2$ and $\phi^4$ above) using Wilson's operator product expansion (OPE). Regarding 5) in the OP's question, I believe it would be of great interest to prove that the moments of the solution $\Phi$ constructed by Martin satisfy the (dynamical version) of Wilson's OPE, and then compare $\Phi^3$ obtained by the theory of regularity structures with the one constructed (from the OPE) in my 2nd quantized KC paper. 

In the OP's case the relevant space is $\Gamma:=\wedge^q({\rm Sym}^2(\mathbb{R}^n))$. The description of a generating set of invariants is exactly the same. The only thing that changes is the identification of $\Gamma$ with a space of arrays $T$. In this situation $T_{i_1,\ldots,i_{2q}}$ must stay the same if two indices in the same block of $P_{\ast}$ are exchanged and it must change sign if two blocks are exchanged. Also the transversality condition can be dropped. Note that one can reduce the generating set a bit as follows. Instead of Wick contractions (aka perfect matchings) $P$ one can index invariants by integer partitions $\lambda$ of $q$. If one takes $T=A^{(1)}\wedge\cdots\wedge A^{(q)}$ for a bunch of symmetric matrices $A^{(1)},\ldots,A^{(q)}$ then the invariant encoded by $\lambda$ is the complete antisymmetrization of a "manual polarization" of $$ \prod_{a}\ {\rm tr}(A^{\lambda_a})\ . $$ By "manual polarization" I mean replace each $A$ factor by an $A^{(k)}$ so everyone is used exactly once. If one thinks of $P$'s as fixed-point-free involutions, take the cycle type of the composition $P\circ P_{\ast}$ and divide all the cycle lengths by two (extra care needed if lack of transversality). That gives you the partition $\lambda$. It is easy to see that the invariant $L_{\lambda}$ vanishes unless all the parts $\lambda_a$ are congruent to 1 mod 4. It also vanishes if there are repeated (odd) parts. Indeed if one does a cyclic permutation along a trace of length $\lambda_a$ one gets the identity $L_{\lambda}=(-1)^{\lambda_a-1}L_{\lambda}$. So an even part kills the invariant. For $\lambda_a$ congruent to 3 mod 4 one can do a "mirror symmetry" of the cycle which fixes a vertex. This involves $(\lambda_a-1)/2$ disjoint transpositions which is an odd number. If there are two cycles of length $\lambda_a$ then exchanging them gives $(-1)^{\lambda_a^2}=-1$ since we reduced the discussion to odd parts. So your space of invariants $(\wedge^q({\rm Sym}^2(\mathbb{R}^n)))^{O(n)}$ is of dimension 1 for $q=1$. Then it vanishes for $q=2,3,4$. I suspect it has dimension 1 for $q=5$ and $n$ not too small. By the above it has at most that dimension. Showing equality means showing that the antisymmetrization of $$ {\rm tr}(A^{(1)}A^{(2)}A^{(3)}A^{(4)}A^{(5)}) $$ is not identically zero. Let $N(q)$ be the number of integer partitions $\lambda$ of $q$ with distinct parts that are congruent to 1 mod 4. The argument I just gave proves the upper bound $$ {\rm dim}(\wedge^q({\rm Sym}^2(\mathbb{R}^n))^{O(n)})\le N(q)\ . $$ Interestingly, the computations by Vit also give a computer assisted proof that, in fact, equality holds for $q\le 14$ (and $n$ large enough, i.e., in the stable case).
