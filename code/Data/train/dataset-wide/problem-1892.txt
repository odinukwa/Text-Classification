According to Howarth, et al. 2011, from 4 wells they sampled, flow back after hydraulic fracturing lead to a release of methane equal to 0.6-3.2% of lifetime production of the well. Fracking wells released methane equal to 3.6-7.9% of lifetime production from all sources, while non-fracking wells released 1.7-6.2% of lifetime production. Petron, et al. 2014 come to similar conclusions, though they don't provide data for lifetime individual well production to allow comparisons. They measured from an aircraft and found 10ppb to 100ppb increases in methane concentration in the air above wells at the Denver-Julenberg fracking site. They note that their estimated methane release is 2-3 times higher than the EPA's estimates (i.e. the estimates under which the fracking company filed its environmental impact statement). I don't like this study as much due to lack of information about what stage of production the wells are at (if they fracked two years ago and are still pumping, then this is just due to leaky pipes, not due to the fracking process). In any case, there is some significant evidence that fracking is releasing more methane than it is expected to. The first paper adds some discussion of prevention measures and such. I will say this, it barely matters in the long run if the methane is leaking or being pumped into your furnace and burned. Methane isn't going to last too long in an oxygen atmosphere, and its all going to end up as CO$_2$ sooner or later. 

Table 2 of this paper lists concentrations in CI chondrites of all elements in ppm with variances. This is for one 14kg meteorite that fell in Orgeuil, France in 1868. Check out pages 8-10 for the table and data. 

You aren't supposed to do link only answers, but that is really all this questions deserves. Did you look on Google? I did. $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ Those were 3 of the first 9 hits on google, and they all have code examples. There is no close option due to lack of effort, but I'll give it a downvote. 

The Himalayas are rising--as many people have heard. What other mountain ranges are still rising at a rate faster than they are being worn down by erosion? 

I hope you can see from these examples why the interaction between carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect is too complicated to be modeled in a simple thought experiment. 

I use the Regional Climate Center network for data. There are 6 different climate centers hosted by various research institutes, they each have their own database system for sharing data. I don't know how it compares to the other linked sources, but what I value about the climate centers is the presence of lots of incomplete records from smaller stations. I'm not sure if those records are available through NOAA, but I do a lot of computer aggregation where more data points is more better. 

I can't answer part a, but I can help with part b. We first must determine how much kinetic energy, then we can use simple thermodynamics to see how much that could possibly heat up a mass of water. Kinetic energy calculations are numerically modeled in Dutykh and Dias, 2009. Their largest example uses parameters of a 150km x 50km x 35km fault slipping by 15m at 4 km depth (values in Table 2 of paper). Total energy computed is shown in the graphs below: 

Behrenfeld and Falkowski, 1997 have maps of cholorphyll concentration for the entire world on pages 11-13 of the linked paper. The maps are divided by into yearly concentration and seasonal concentration, with the maps filled out from experimental data by two different modeling methods. These maps are in mg C / m$^2$ / year, but they offer the normalization of $$\frac{4.6 \text{mg C / hour}}{1\text{ mg Chlorophyll}}.$$ Chlorophyll production varies by optical depth, which is the distance that light can penetrate into the water. Optical depth depends on various characteristics of the seawater like sediment node, so it doesn't have an exact analogue to water depth. However, Fig 1A supports a conclusion that plankton production is reduced by an order of magnitude at depth of 20 meters, and by 2 orders of magnitude by 60 meters. If we confine the chlorophyll to entirely the top 60m of the ocean, then we can convert $$\frac{1 \text{ mg C}}{\text{m}^2\cdot\text{year}}\cdot\frac{1 \text{ mg Chlorophyll}}{4.6\text{ mg C / hour}}\cdot \frac{1 \text{year}}{8760 \text{ hours}} \cdot \frac{1}{60 \text{m}}= \frac{0.41 \text{ ng Chlorophyll}}{\text{m}^3}.$$ Using this convertion specifically on map A on page 11 of the linked paper, I get for your answers: 

Whether that mechanism is correct or not, only time will tell. In conclusion, due to the temperature and pressure characteristics of the asthenosphere, it is less viscous than the chemically identical mesosphere. This may be because of its place on temperature and pressure curves, because it contains pockets of partially molten rock, because rising mantle plumes make the asthenosphere actually hotter than the mesosphere, or otherwise. 

Edit for further explanation: The greenhouse effect itself varies with more than just Carbon Dioxide level. Lets use the cases of Venus, Earth, and Mars to compare. Venus: Surface temperature is about 735 K. By Wien's law, the maximum wavelength for IR radiation from the surface (into space) is 2.897 mm / 735 K = ~4000 $\mu\text{m}$ or 2500 cm$^{-1}$ as it is more commonly stated. Take a look at this chart of Carbon Dioxide's absorption spectrum: 

I feel bad answering this one without any research reference, but I can tell you that what you are seeing in the OP's picture is a 'man overboard drill.' In that drill, the objective is to rotate the ship's rear section away from a man who many have fallen overboard and then circle the ship around (in an exact circle) to come up alongside the fallen man. In order to do this with a ship, you throw the rudder over hard and fire up the engines ahead full. With many warships, the engine's toque is enough to produce massive cavitation (bubble formation) for the duration of the turn. As you end the turn you will usually throw a 2/3 backing bell, which will produce even more cavitation. That is the 'trail' you see behind the ship. Specifically, the ship you see there is HMS Echo, which has a diesel-electric azimuth drive mounted below the ship, which will provide a very high torque. Lots of cavitation (and you can feel a 10,000 ton ship vibrate during these maneuvers) means lots of bubbles are formed up to 15m below the surface (depending on the size of the ship; only about 6m for the pictured Echo). As the bubble propagate to the surface they disrupt the passage of surface wavelets and form the calm area shown. One more factor is that navies train to put the man on the leeward side of the ship during recovery. Thus, in this picture the stern was swung to port (as we can see from the 'trail') so the man must have been on starboard, so the man is on the 'starboard' side of the ship during this recovery. That means the wind should be on the port side, so the calm area is being protected from the wind by the mass of the ship. 

After looking at the OP's definition of the biomes that are semi-arid and temperate, I decided to compare them to the biomes in WWF's Wildfinder and sum the area total. The WWF biomes don't really match up with the biomes defined by the OP (and originally by LC King, apparently, though I haven't read anything of his), but they at least give an alternative estimate. For the Semi-Arid Biomes, I have: 

Chain des Puys is the 40km long chain of volcanic features to which Puy de Dome belongs. It sounds like the causes are not completely understood. Unfortunately, all the papers I could find on the topic are in French (understandably), so if you can read French you can try Google Scholar to see if there is more info there. 

The SPI statistic can be considered a standard normally distributed random variable $SPI \sim N(0,1)$. Thus the expected value, or mean, of the SPI statistic is $0$, and its standard deviation and variance are $1$. If the mean of the distribution is zero, then by the central limit theorem, you would expect that the limit of your sample mean (the mean of ~40 years of data) would approach zero as your sample got larger. So yes, it is both possible and expected. What may be causing your confusion is that SPI can be calculated for different time sets. If you are analyzing month by month, then I would assume that your dataset is divided by month. In that case, the SPI is calculated individually for each month, so that the mean of any month or set of months over many years would tend to zero, as per the last paragraph. It would not make sense to calculate a monthly SPI from a 12-month mean divided by 12 (to give you a mean per month on an annual basis) In seasonal wet-dry climates you would have massively negative SPI value in the dry season, and highly positive numbers in the wet season. The monthly means are individually given an SPI statistic to allow apples-to-apples comparisons with the same month in other years.
