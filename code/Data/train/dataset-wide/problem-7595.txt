I hope this question is not completely trivial: Suppose $V$ is an irreducible projective variety and $U\subset V$ is a Zariski open subset isomorphic to an affine variety. Is it true that $V\setminus U$ is a Cartier divisor in $V$? If not, what conditions should we impose on $V$? (I guess if $V$ is smooth, then everything is fine?) 

Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be two smooth curves of degrees $m$ and $n$ in $\mathbb CP^2$. By Bezout's theorem the maximal number of their intersections is $mn$. I wonder if the minimal possible number is known for all pairs $(m,n)$? In particular for which pairs $(m,n)$ there can be exactly one point of intersection? 

I believe that the following questions are very basic, but I don't know how to get a reference. Consider a curve in the plane $C\in \mathbb C^2$ with a singularity at $0$ and suppose it is unibranch at zero (i.e. analytically irreducible). Then I guess one should be able to define "arithmetic genus defect" of the curve at $0$. Namely if one smooths analytically $C$, its geometric genus will grow by a positive number (in case of the cusp $x^2=y^3$ it will grow by one), and let us call this number the defect. Question 1. Is this defect well defined (independent of a smoothing)? How is it called and how one should calculate it (say it terms of the local ring of $C$ at $0$)? Question 2. Suppose we have an explicit local parametrisation of $C$ at $0$, say by two holomorphic functions $f(t), g(t)$ (polynomials if you wish). Is it possible to find this "defect" as a certain invariant of this pair of functions at $t=0$? Question 1 is settled in the answer of unknown and Question 2 in comments to it by Roy and Vivek 

Suppose $X$ is a normal projective variety over $\mathbb C$. In the case $X$ is smooth according to Hodge theory $h^1(X,O(X))$ is the dimension of the space of holomorphic $1$-forms on $X$ and this number is equal as well to the half of the first Betti number $b_1(X)/2$ . I would like to know what happen in the case when $X$ is singular and normal. 1) Is there some relation (equality or inequality) between $h^1(X,O(X))$ and $b_1(X)$? For example does $b_1(X)=0$ imply $h^1(X,O(X))=0$? 2) Suppose that $h^1(X,O(X))=n$ is it true that there is a canonical $n$-dimensional space of $1$-forms on $X$, holomorphic outside of its singularities? (if yes, can something be said about their behaviour at singularities?) Is there some pedagogical reference treating these questions? 

In a course of writing a paper I realised that I need a lemma below, and found a half page proof. I have not seen this lemma before and wonder if maybe someone here knows this lemma or can prove it in five lines. Please let me know if this is the case. Lemma. Let $C$ be an annulus in $\mathbb R^2$ given by inequalities $1\le x^2+y^2\le 2$. Let $f$ be a smooth function on $C$, whose gradient vanishes only in the interior of $C$ and whose only critical points are isolated minima. Then there is a gradient trajectory of $f$ that joins two boundaries of the annulus. 

How to determine a functor (natrually arising from geometry or homological algebra) to be locally of finite presentation? Is there any reference for such staff? My example of functors underlying this question is functors of the form $$\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(A,\mathbb{G}_m)$$ for $A$ some group scheme or even some fppf-sheaf of geometric meaning over some base scheme $S$, and $\mathcal{E}xt^1_S(,)$ denotes the 1st fppf extension sheaf in the category of abelian fppf-sheaves over $S$. 

The group cohomology of cyclic groups can be computed easily due to the periodity. Now how can one compute the group cohomology $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? As least in some special case, e.g. $M$ has trivial action, or even $M=\mathbb{Z}$? I would like to know the case that $M$ is not $\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, can one compute $H^r(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\times\cdots\times \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},M)$? 

How far is it to extend the results of SGA III Exp. VIB from group schemes to group spaces? In particular, does Corollary 4.4 from SGA III Exp. VIB hold for G/S being merely a group space? Here the base $S$ is still a scheme. Is there any reference for group spaces? I checked stack project, but the section 'properties of group algebraic spaces' from Chapter "groupoids in alg. sp." is less than 1 page. Raynaud's IHES paper contains a few pages. To be more precise, I would like to know if the following is ture: Let $G/S$ be group space locally of finite presentation with $S$ a trait (to make it easier), let $s,t$ be the closed point and generic point of $S$ respectively. Suppose $G_s$ and $G_t$ are smooth over $k(s)$ and $k(t)$ respectively, and $\mathrm{dim}G_s=\mathrm{dim}G_t$. Then the functor $G^0$ (defined as in SGA III Exp. VI B Def. 3.1) is represented by a smooth group scheme over $S$. 

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a morphism of schemes (or algebraic spaces), and $s:Y\rightarrow X$ is a section to $f$, i.e. $fs=1_{Y}$. Question: Is $s$ an (closed) immersion? 

In Raynaud's paper "Specialisation du foncteur de Picard", Theorem 3.3.1 says that algebraic group spaces, which are locally of finite type and separated over any locally noetherian normal 1-dim scheme, are group schemes. On the other hand, relative Picard functors for proper flat finite presentation schemes $f:X\rightarrow S$ over DVR such that $f$ is cohomologically flat are represented by algebraic sapces, but are often not schemes, see also that paper or the book Neron Model. 

Is an algebraic space over a DVR, whose special fibre (and all its infinitesimal neighborhood) and generic fibre are schemes, actually a scheme? 

Is there anyone familiar with this paper? It seems to me it contains "some" typos and even some small elementary mistakes, which makes my reading very slow. Of course the key reason for my slow reading is I wasn't familiar with Faltings and Chai's book, from which the paper use the notations and results. Maybe I have some (or many) misunderstanding. I hope someone could help me clear up my confusions: 

I am interested in the following example! Let $k$ be a field, let $X_0$ be the scheme $\mathrm{Spec}R$ with $R_0=k[x,y]/(xy)$, let $R$ be the strict Hensilian localalisation of $R_0$ at the origin and $X=\mathrm{Spec}R$, we define a sheaf $F$ on $X$ by $F(U)=\mathbb{Z}^2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ for $U$ open in $X$ depending on if $U$ contains the origin or not (hence the stalk of $F$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ at the origin, and $\mathbb{Z}$ at other points). The restriction maps for defining $F$ are given by $\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}:(m,n)\mapsto m+n$ (in fact the sheaf comes from the log structure associated to the embedding $X_0\subset \mathbb{A}^2$ ). Since $X$ is strict Hensilian, we have $H^1(X,F)=0$. Now consider the projection $p:\mathbb{G}_{m,R}\rightarrow X=\mathrm{Spec}R$. What would be the group $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},p^*F)$? Maybe an easier version, is $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},\mathbb{Z})$ zero? We do know $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m},\mathbb{Z})=H^1(\mathrm{Spec}R,\mathbb{Z})=0$! 

Consider the Grassmanian $G(k,n)$ ($k\le \frac{n}{2}$) and take its Plucker embedding. Consider now the space of all normal rational curves of degree $k$, contained in the Plucker embedding of the Grassmanian. Finally, take the closure of this space. I would like to know if this closure has some nice description. Example. The Grassmanian $G(2,4)$ is a quadric $Q$ in $\mathbb P^5$. A normal curve of degree two in this quadric is just the intersection of $Q$ with a $\mathbb P^2$. So the corresponding space in this case is $G(3,6)$. 

As far as I understand it follows from the work of M. Freedman that there exist locally flat embeddings of two dimensional surfaces in $\mathbb R^4$ that can not be smoothed in the class of locally flat embedding. (For definition of locally flat see $URL$ I am curious if one can draw a realistic picture of such a surface. At least is it possible to draw an intersection of such a surface with a (linear) hyperplane in $\mathbb R^4$? Is the Hausdorff dimension of such an intersection equals $1$? 

Let $X$ be a smooth compact complex manifold of dimension $n$. Suppose $L$ is a line bundle on $X$ such that $dim(H^0(X,L^k))>c\cdot k^n$ for $c>0$ and $k>>0$. Question. Is it true that $X$ is Moishezon? Is there some reference for this statement? 

Take $\mathbb C^2$ with coordinates $(z,w)$. Suppose that $J$ is a $C^{\infty}$ almost complex structure on $\mathbb C^2$ such that the line $w=0$ is $J$-holomorphic and $J(0,0)$ is given by $(z,w)\to (iz,iw)$. Suppose that there is a smooth function $f(z):\mathbb D\to \mathbb C$ defined on a unit disk $\mathbb D$ such that the graph $(z,f(z))\subset \mathbb C^2$ is a $J$-holomorphic subvariety of $(\mathbb C^2, J)$ (we don't assume that $z\to (z,f(z))$ is a $J$-holomorphic map). Question. Is it true that there is $n$ and a constant $c\in(0,1)$ such that $c|z^n|<|f(z)|<\frac{1}{c} |z^n|$ for sufficiently small $z$? Remark. The statement is trivial in the case when $J$ coincides with the standard complex structure on $\mathbb C^2$. This question is a follow up to Two smooth tangent almost complex curves in a $4$-manifold 

This questions if related to a cute article of Beauville where he proves in particular the following theorem: $URL$ Theorem.âˆ’ A smooth complex projective hypersurface of dimension $\ge 2$ and degree $\ge 3$ admits no endomorphism of degree $>1$. Here "endomorphism" means a holomorphic self-map and the proof of the theorem uses algebraic geometry bien sure:) . But the following question is not mentioned in the article: Question. What are smooth complex projective hypersufaces in $\mathbb CP^n$ that admit topological self-maps of degree $>1$? I wonder if this question is trivial and completely answered for $n>2$? Added. The comment of algori settles this question (apperently). But still I wonder for example how one can construct a self-map of a quintic in $\mathbb CP^3$ of degree $>1$. 

I would like to find some notes (or book), that explains on a very basic level what is a line bundle on a complex projective manifold. Maybe even, what is a line bundle on $\mathbb CP^n$. It seems to me that in a "usual" algebro-geometric approach line bundles come quite late, only after one defines what is a sheaf, ect. I wonder if this can be explained in "quicker" way?
