I'm not aware of any official (i.e., IAU) definition of a multiple star system. However, as someone who used to do research in that field, I would interpret multiple star system as encompassing systems with two or more stars. So a binary system, a triple system, and a quadruple system are all multiple star systems. 

Stars less than about 0.3 solar masses are fully convective, so hydrogen throughout the entire star can be transported to the core and consumed. At higher masses, the core is radiative, so only hydrogen that starts in the core is consumed. 

Based on a Simbad search, it looks like the most distant white dwarf is WD J0106-0014, which was measured in Debes et al. 2011 to be at 6442 pc. Here's the Simbad page: $URL$ 

Andy Gould proposed a classical derivation of Hawking radiation in a somewhat obscure paper from 1987. The essential argument is that a black hole must have a finite, non-zero entropy (otherwise you could violate the second law of thermodynamics with a black hole). Moreover, the entropy of the black hole must depend only on its area (otherwise you could change the area of a black hole via the Penrose process and lower its entropy and make a perpetual motion machine). If a black hole has an entropy and a mass, then it has a temperature. If it has a temperature, then it must radiate thermally (otherwise you could again violate the second law of thermodynamics). Of course, if you look at the Hawking radiation temperature, there's a Planck's constant in there, so it has to know something about quantum mechanics, right? But it turns out that it's actually thermodynamics in general that knows about quantum mechanics, not general relativity --- Planck's constant is only needed to keep entropies finite (and therefore temperatures non-zero). This is true of black holes and blackbodies alike. 

I see no reason why this wouldn't work. The innermost Galilean moons are in a 1:2:4 resonance so it's clearly a stable orbital configuration. They could all be tidally locked if you want, but the planet itself can't be tidally locked with all of them. If the planet were tidally locked it would likely be locked with the innermost moon. Also of note, the Galilean moons all have eccentricity less than 0.01 and inclinations less than 0.5 degrees. 

I don't know about names for the planets, specifically, but the orbits are called S-type and P-type: 

The short answer to your question is no, there is not dark matter between galaxies, at least at any appreciable level. There is ordinary matter between galaxies, called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The IGM is an extremely dilute, hot gas that pervades the space between galaxies. The typical density of the IGM is about one hydrogen atom per cubic meter and its temperature is somewhere around 10^6 K. These high temperatures keep the IGM in pressure equilibrium with any galaxies and prevent it from collapsing onto galaxies. Dark matter, however, is cold, and lacks the pressure support of the gas in the IGM, so it condenses onto galaxies. [1] One interesting difference between dark matter and ordinary matter is that dark matter lacks any sort of cooling mechanism. As a result, when ordinary matter collapses onto a galaxy, it can cool and condense into a relatively compact space and later form stars and planets. The dark matter, however, remains extended because it has no way to shed its gravitational potential energy. Galaxies therefore exhibit a substantial dark matter halo, where the ratio of dark matter to ordinary matter increases substantially a few galactic radii away from the center. Within the galaxy itself, ordinary matter is dominant by at least an order of magnitude, but the density of ordinary matter falls off exponentially while the dark matter falls off only with the cube of distance, leaving dark matter dominant a few galactic radii away from the galaxy. One interesting question is whether or not dark matter halos exist in intergalactic space without a corresponding host galaxy at the center. As far as we can tell, the answer to that seems to be no, or at least, such structures must be quite small and exceedingly rare. There are dwarf galaxies (only 10^6 solar masses or so) which have enormous dark matter halos (much out of proportion to their size, relative to the Milky Way), but nearly every halo seems to have at least some ordinary matter present, no matter how feeble. Cosmic voids are an even more extreme example. Voids are dominated by dark energy and therefore expand more rapidly than the rest of the universe. Voids tend to push any matter (dark or otherwise) into walls that separate them from surrounding voids. In a real sense, the universe is made of voids, and everything we know lies on the walls and filaments that separate them. This paper examined dark matter halos in cosmic voids and essentially found that there weren't any. In other words, they found that dark matter halos in cosmic voids have host galaxies just as often as dark matter halos outside of cosmic voids (which is to say, almost always). [1]: To be absolutely pedantic, I wouldn't doubt that there are a few dark matter particles whizzing about in intergalactic space. But I would be surprised if its density exceeded the (already puny) density of ordinary matter in the IGM. 

Yes. When a core collapse supernova happens, it takes a few hours for the shock wave to reach the surface and "break out" (when we first "see" it). Meanwhile, the neutrinos can escape nearly directly once they reach the top of the core. Of course, as you wrote, photons travel slightly faster, so if the SN is far enough away, the photons might overtake these neutrinos. However, I have not done the calculation to see if the universe is big enough. 

The degree of ionization in the photosphere varies with depth of course, but overall it is small. Table 1 of the Bilderberg Continuum Atmosphere (Solar Physics, 3, 5, 1968) gives the pressure and the electron pressure at various optical depths in a comprehensive model. The ratio of the pressure gives the Ne/Ntotal. At optical depth = 1 at 5000 Angstroms, Pgas = 1.412E5 (cgs) and Pe = 6.239E1. The ratio is 4.4E-4. The hydrogen ionization, also given in the table is 4.07E-4. The model assumes Helium abundance of 0.1 which is off a bit from the modern number of 0.087. 

Transmission gratings on their own introduce chromatic aberration. This is because they change the effective focal length and do so as a function of wavelength. The chromatic aberration can be eliminated by introducing a prism of the correct dispersion. Known as a grism, the grating/prism combination provides an unaberrated image at the 0th order in addition to the spectrum, although the spectrum has fairly low resolution. 

We do not yet know the answer to this question. We observe the universal expansion, which should be slowing down from mutual gravitational attraction, is not slowing down as much as it should and might not be slowing down at all about now. One explanation for this is that the cosmological constant, an added term in Einstein's equations of General Relativity is non-zero. This term allows for gravity to effectively repel by causing expansion in low density regions. For the entire universe, the expansion resulted from an initial impulse (the Big Bang) and gravity has been working against this, trying to compress it. With the cosmological constant included, as more and more regions of the universe reach sufficiently low densities, gravity reverses and enhances expansion. Alternatively, some think the expansion is due to some particle or another force that provides a negative pressure in the universe. 

The tide would be locked in place, roughly, because the Moon always shows the same side to the Earth (tidally locked). But the height of the water at the location facing the Earth and the opposite side should be greater than the mean height, and at the limb, as we see it, the height will be lower than the mean but by half the magnitude of the high tide. Imagine installing a pipe with cross-section 1 cm$^2$ from the top of the ocean at its high point down to the center of the moon and then back up to the top of the ocean at a point where the net tidal field from the Earth is 0. Fill it with water until one side is equal with the water level on one side and its level on the other side will automatically be equal to the water level there. The weights of the water on both sides need to be equal if it is static. For now, we will ignore that g changes when one gets deep into the moon. Therefore, roughly speaking $\rho$gh should be the same in both sections of the pipe, and: $$ \rho(g_M - g_t)(h_t + r_M) = \rho g_M r_M $$ where $g_t$ is tidal acceleration $$ g_t(Moon) = 2\frac{GM_Er_M}{d^3}. $$ Subscript M means Moon and E means Earth and d is the separation between the Earth and Moon. Solving for h$_t$ gives: $$ h_t = \frac{g_tr_M}{g_M - g_t} \sim \frac{g_t}{g_M}r_M $$ We could substitute values in here, but if we do this in comparison with the height of the tide on the Earth, 54 cm, we cancel out some of the error in the approximation and get an even simpler formula, namely, $$ \frac{h_t(Moon)}{h_t(Earth)} = \frac{M_E}{M_M} \frac{g_E}{g_M} \Big(\frac{r_M}{r_E}\Big)^2 $$ The mass of the Earth is 81.3 time greater, the acceleration at the surface of the Moon is 1/6.25 of Earth's g force, and the diameter of the Moon is 0.2725 of the Earth. So, that is 81.3*6.25*.2725$^2$ = 37.7 time higher than the Earth's tide or 37.7*54 cm = 20.4 meters. Note that the height of the ocean does not matter as long as it is considerably more than 20 meters. On the other hand, the water would begin boiling since it is at 0 pressure until a water atmosphere is created, but the moon is too small to hold an atmosphere for long and the whole ocean would be gone in a while. 

You might find this paper helpful: $URL$ Look specifically at Eq. 5 for the wavelength dependence. To get the intensity, use Equation 1. The value of $u$ can be found in the caption to Figure 2. 

It is indeed possible to measure the AU using transits of Mercury, and Edmund Halley tried to do just that in 1677. However, there are two advantages to a transit of Venus. The first is that during the transit, Venus is only 0.28 AU from Earth, whereas Mercury is about 0.7 AU away. This makes the parallactic effect twice as big. The second difficulty is that you need to measure the time between second contact and third contact (i.e., the first and last time that the planet is entirely in front of the Sun). Mercury is so small that it is hard to determine when second and third contact are. (In fact the limiting effect for the measurement of the AU during the transit of Venus was the so-called "black drop effect", which made it impossible to measure the times of second and third contact to a precision less than about ten seconds.) A former professor of mine from when I was in graduate school has a really excellent writeup of the history of these measurements: $URL$ 

The tidal field of the Galaxy does lead to the oscillation of the plane of very wide binaries. The mechanism of this oscillation is identical to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism (the only difference is that in the case of KL oscillations the tidal field is generated by the averaged orbit of a tertiary stellar companion). However, if you run the numbers, the timescale for these oscillations is extremely long for any of the planets (I forget how long exactly, but much longer than the age of the Universe). It's somewhat smaller for comets in the Oort Cloud, only a few billion years. 

There just aren't any other mechanisms to keep the population excited in a Stromgren sphere. In principle collisions can also lead to excitations, but if you do an order of magnitude calculation you'll find that the time between collisions is much longer than the time to receive an ionizing photon. In a laboratory setting you might be able to coerce some particles into remaining in an excited state using the Quantum Zeno effect, but that won't happen in interstellar space. So without something to keep the atoms in an excited state, even if you start with everything in the excited state, in time $\tau$ you will find that everything has decayed to the ground state, with the exception of some very small fraction $\tau_{\textrm{ion}} / \tau$, which may have moved up to a higher energy state. Assuming the lifetimes of those very excited states are comparable, after a few more times $\tau$, you will find that even those will have decayed to the ground state. 

This is actually a very subtle question, much more so than the answers to the similar questions provided in the comments give it credit for. When I was in graduate school at Ohio State I routinely asked this question to visiting dynamicists and invariably got different answers. The very basic answer is that if you have two sufficiently strong resonances sufficiently close together, then the resonance will be unstable. Otherwise, the resonance will be stable. But what determines "sufficiently strong" and "sufficiently close" is where things get very complicated quickly. A basic criterion is the Chirikov criterion. (The Scholarpedia article is somewhat more detailed.) However, the Chirikov criterion is not universally valid. If you have overlapping resonances, then an object gets bounced back and forth between these two resonances chaotically. These different resonances perturb the orbit in different ways, and eventually they will perturb the orbit into an unstable orbit, thus leading to depletion of the resonance. If a resonance is "distant" from other resonances, then the resonance tends to keep objects locked in place, leading to an excess of objects in the resonance. Most of the resonances in the asteroid belt are fairly close together, which leads to them being unstable. The Kirkwood Gaps are the most prominent manifestation of these instabilities. For example, the Alinda family of asteroids are in a 1:3 resonance with Jupiter, and are very close to a 4:1 resonance with the Earth. This leads to instability, and hence very few asteroids in this family. However, in the outer Solar System, the resonances are generally far apart, and so are mostly stable. The plutinos are one example of such a stable resonance, being in a 3:2 resonance with Neptune.
