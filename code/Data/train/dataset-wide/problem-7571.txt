Weyman has calculated generators of the radical ideal of $\overline{\mathcal{O}_{\lambda}}$ for every $\lambda$. See "The equations of conjugacy classes of nilpotent matrices", Invent. Math. 98 (1989), no. 2, 229–245. In particular, see Theorem 4.6 and the definitions which precede it. 

The following family of examples can be extracted from Lenart and Ray, Some applications of incidence Hopf algebras to formal group theory and algebraic topology (Postscript). Let $B_2$, $B_3$, $B_4$, … be any sequence of sets. An element of $X \otimes Y$ is a plane tree $T$, where every non-leaf has at least $2$ children, where every leaf is labeled with an element of $X \sqcup Y$, and every non-leaf with $i$ children is labeled with an element of $B_i$, subject to the condition: 

A vague attempt to explain how I found this. Let $C$ be the centralizer of $A^{-1}B $. The set of elements $M$ such that $AMB=BMA$ is $C A^{-1}$. The curve $A+tB$ is in $AC$ and it seems hard to find any properties of it which aren't true of all of $AC$. So we basically want to know whether $(AC)^p$ meets $CA^{-1}$ for sufficiently large $p$. I flirt with Hecke operators (because we are basically multiplying double cosets) and ergodic theory (because we want to know if a small subset of a group spreads out under multiplication). Eventually I decide that the answer is probably "no". If so, then the most likely way to prove it is to find a function $f:GL_n(\mathbb{R}) \to \mathbb{R}$ which is more or less multipliciative, large for positive powers of $A$, small for negative powers of $A$ and bounded on $C$. A character would be great. But the only character of $GL_n$ is determinant and it doesn't work. Eventually, I realize that I can arrange for $A+tB$ to lie in a subgroup $H$ of $GL_n$ which has additional characters; let $T$ be the abelianization of $H$. It also seems like a good idea to make all of the eigenvalues of $A^{-1} B$ complex, as then $A+tB$ is always invertible. In other words, $T$ should have rank at least $2$, and should have lots of $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$ factors. So I decide to try $H$ $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b & \ast & \ast \\ -b & a & \ast & \ast \\ 0 & 0 & c & -d \\ 0 & 0 & d & c \end{pmatrix}$$ with character $f=\frac{c^2+d^2}{a^2+b^2}$. By taking $f(A) = f(B)>1$, I ensure that $f(C)=1$, so $f$ is bounded on $C$ and large on $A$ as desired. At this point I stop trying to be systematic and just try some examples until one works. 

This determinant came up, and was evaluated, in the comments of the Secret Blogging Seminar. The motivation there was that it vanishes if and only if $V^{\otimes n}$ has neglible endomorphisms in Deligne's category of "$GL_x$ representations for noninteger $x$". Here $V$ is the "$x$-dimensional representation of $GL_x$". See that post for more. 

A necessary condition: Let $f: \mathbb{Q}^d \to \mathbb{Q}$ be a homogenous map of degree $d$. If $f$ is a norm, then the corresponding map $\mathbb{C}^d \to \mathbb{C}$ will be a product of linear forms. That's always true for $d=2$ (fundamental theorem of algebra), but rare for $d=3$. 

I'll write $K$ for the compact group. A correction to start with: You write $\int_K f g$, but I assume you mean $\int_K f \bar{g}$. Complex conjugation We need to identify the map $\sigma: R \to R$ which has the property that $\sigma(f)|_K = \overline{\sigma(f)}$. Note that this map will NOT be complex conjugation of functions on $G$; all of the elements of $R$ are holomorphic as functions on $G$. For example, if $K=U(n)$ and $G=GL_n$, then $\sigma(f)(g) = \overline{f}(\overline{g}^{-T})$. We cannot define $\sigma$ completely canonically, because choosing a different $K$ will change $\sigma$. However, if you have a subalgebra $\mathfrak{k}$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ which you want to be the algebra of $K$, then I think that $\sigma$ is the unique $\mathbb{C}$-antilinear Hopf automorphism (commutes with both multiplication and co-multiplication) whose induced action on $\mathfrak{g}$ fixes $\mathfrak{k}$. And, of course, an $\mathbb{R}$-subalgera $L$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ is a possible candidate for $L$ iff $\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{k} \otimes \mathbb{C}$ and the Killing form is positive definite (or maybe its negative definite) on $L$. Integration Integration is a special case of the Reynolds operator. In general, if $G$ is a reductive group, and $V$ is an algebraic representation of $G$, than $\rho: V \to V$ is the unique $G$-equivariant idempotent whose image is the $G$-invariants. I'm not sure of a really clean way to define it. One fairly algebraic way is the following: Let $v \in V$, and let $U \subset V$ be the sub-rep spanned by the $G$-orbit of $v$. Note that $U$ is finite dimensional. Let $\Omega$ denote the Casimir; let the characteristic polynomial of $\Omega$ acting on $U$ be $x^k g(x)$ with $g(0) \neq 0$; then $\rho|_U = g(\Omega)/g(0)$. Conceptually, $\rho = \lim_{t \to \infty} e^{- t \Omega}$ (the heat equation) but that's not algebraic. In your case, you want the Reynolds operator for $G$ acting on $R$. Since I think it is easiest to define $\rho$ from the Cassimir, you need to know how to algebraically write down the action of $\mathfrak{g}$ on $R$. I think it is as follows: Let $\epsilon: R \to \mathbb{C}$ be evaluation at the identity (normally called counit). Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the kernel of $\epsilon$, so $\mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^2 = \mathfrak{g}^{\vee}$. Then $\mathfrak{g}$ maps $R \to \mathbb{C}$ by $g \cdot f = \langle g, f-\epsilon(f)+\mathfrak{m}^2 \rangle$. This is the standard description of how to see elements of the Zariski tangent space as derivations. We want to extend from a single vector to an entire left invariant vector field. I think the recipe is $R \stackrel{\Delta}{\longrightarrow} R \otimes R \stackrel{g \cdot \otimes 1}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{C} \otimes R \cong R$, where $\Delta$ is comultiplication. Hope that helps! 

If I understand the question correctly, I think the answer is a little larger than $2$. I am interpreting the question to be looking for the longest substring of the form $i(i+1)(i+2) \cdots (i+r)$ occurring anywhere in the permutation. The probability that any string of $3$ characters will be of this form is $(n-2)/\binom{n}{3} = O(1/n^2)$. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of such strings of length $3$ is $O(1/n)$. In particular, the probability that we have a string of length $3$ or higher is $O(1/n)$. 

$4$-colorability for graphs that meet the hypotheses of Whitney's theorem easily implies $4$-colorability of all planar graphs. If $G'$ has a Hamiltonian cycle, then $G'$ is trivially $3$-edge-colorable. Graphs of the form $G'$ tend to be Hamiltonian. This is true both rigorously -- Hamiltonian graphs have density approaching $1$ among cubic graphs with $n$ labeled vertices (see Robinson and Wormwald) and as a statement about common experience -- the smallest counter-examples have about 36 vertices and are not obvious. MathSciNet recommends this survey for more on Hamiltonianicity of cubic graphs. 

I have a full proof in type $A$, and most of a proof in the other types. Notation: $\alpha_1$, $\alpha_2$, ..., $\alpha_n$ are the (positive) simple roots, $\Phi^{+}$ is the set of all positive roots, $\rho$ is determined by the condition $\langle \alpha^{\vee}_i, \rho \rangle =1$ for all $i$. The element $\sigma$ is defined as $\sum_i \alpha_i$ I'll write $\alpha \geq \beta$ to indicate that $\alpha -\beta = \sum c_i \alpha_i$ for $c_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. So the condition that $\lambda-\mu$ is in the interior of the positive cone and occurs in $V_{\lambda}$ states that $\mu \leq \lambda - \sigma$. Our strategy is to show that $$K_{\lambda \mu} \geq K_{\lambda (\lambda - \sigma)} = \# (\mbox{number Coxeter elements}).$$ The gap in this argument is to give a proof in all types of
