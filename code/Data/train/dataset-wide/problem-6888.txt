For Kirzner, the distinction is between "knowledge-as-information and action-knowledge--the latter referring to the knowledge which actually spurs and shapes action." Alertness is necessary and sufficient for turning information-knowledge into action-knowledge. Example: Suppose apples are selling for \$0.40 at the west end of town and for \$1 at the east end of town. John and Mary are both given this piece of knowledge-information. However, Mary is not alert and so she does not act on this piece of information. In contrast, John is alert: he realizes he can profit from this arbitrage opportunity and so acts to transform this knowledge-information into action-knowledge. 

Healthcare spending is 4.6% of GDP (World Bank). I have heard some of my friends who work at the Ministry of Health (Singapore) complaining about how inefficient the Singapore health care system is. But as someone who has lived in both Singapore and the US for a good number of years, I would say (based purely on my own anecdotal experience) that the Singapore healthcare system is extremely efficient, especially if compared to the US. But the US is perhaps the worst-case scenario. I'm not sure how Singapore would compare to other first-world countries. 

The original papers on RU are Dhillon (1998) and Dhillon & Mertens (1999). However, the first contains fatal mistakes and the second is indecipherable. See Börgers & Choo (2017) for a simple and correct exposition/proof of RU. (Of course, the literature on utilitarianism and what you ask is vast. This is just one small example.) 

(Note that in the real world, perfectly elastic demand does not exist. To use the above example, it is never the case that at a price of $1, every non-negative real number is a possible QD. As is often the case in economics, the concept of perfectly elastic demand is simply an abstract idealization that is occasionally helpful for explaining certain phenomena.) †Note that this vertical line segment is often omitted. In my opinion, this omission is a mistake and is one of the reasons for the confusion on your part. 

Your second sentence is false ("However, graphically, even when price falls demand falls to 0."). Below is an example of perfectly elastic demand. At any price above \$1, quantity demanded (QD) is 0, as indicated by the vertical line segment on the left.† But at any price below \$1, QD is not 0, but $\infty$. This is not depicted in the graph below, because we can't depict $\infty$ on a graph. And so the law of demand is not violated: when price falls, QD does not also fall. Instead, QD rises. 

My question: What, if any, are some more recent and similarly-"authoritative" estimates of CPI bias? 

In the standard analysis of the paradox of voting, votes are pivotal only in two scenarios (exact tie or win by 1). But in reality, vote counting is difficult and messy. And in reality, close elections are often disputed and the final outcome of the election may have little to do with who won the actual vote count. (The most famous example was the 2000 US presidential election.) In light of the fact that close elections are usually disputed and rarely settled simply by an accurate count of the vote, what do we mean by a vote being pivotal? How do we calculate this probability? The only analysis I've come across is the one-page appendix in Gelman, Katz, and Bafumi (2004). They argue that the analysis of the paradox of voting is pretty much unchanged, even with disputed elections: 

One measure is to look at standard deviations. If a one standard deviation increase in X leads to a more than a 0.5 (or 1, or ⅓, or whatever) standard deviation increase in Y, then we say that X has a economically significant effect on Y. Is this standard? And if not, what other measures are there to formalize the notion of "economic significance"? 

Unlike in say some US cities, where public transport is always losing money, public transport in Singapore ALWAYS makes very healthy profits. So these are not drains on but rather contributors to the government coffers. If you've only been in US cities where there's often only a few people on a bus, you may find it hard to imagine. But come to any Asian city where public transport is always jam-packed and you can see why public transport is so profitable. 

More examples from other economists/decision theorists/philosophers. The first two are similar to the above. Anand (1987): 

QOQ (quarter on quarter) GDP growth is more common, at least in the US and the UK. See the press releases by the US BEA and UK ONS. For both, the headline rate is the QOQ rate. 

This would correspond to a model where depreciation takes place at the end of yesterday, investment at the start of today, and production in the middle of today. 

I was somewhat surprised by the following claims by Gregory Clark in A Farewell to Alms, A Brief Economic History of the World (2007): 

P.S. GVT's (1985) Table 4 contains several errors. I spotted at least two rounding errors. And also for player 10, the parenthetical values in columns 4 and 6 do not add up to one less than that in column 5 (contrary to the note at the bottom). I contacted Gilovich (Tversky is dead and Vallone I am not sure), but unfortunately he no longer has the original sequences of hits and misses. Table 4 is all we have. 

It is true that over 80% of Singapore residents live in government housing (HDB flats). But these are not the sort of heavily-subsidized public housing you have in some Western countries. Indeed, it is a frequent gripe amongst Singaporeans that these are incredibly expensive and there are often conspiracy theories that the government sometimes actively works to push up prices. Given the lack of transparency and also the fact that Singaporeans are actively encouraged to use their CPF (retirement) savings to pay for these homes, these conspiracy theories are not without merit. Government housing is generally priced at market rates. For example, recently a 1,001 square foot flat went for S\$900,000 (≈ US\$632,000) - this was in the news because it broke a local (Clementi) record, but it doesn't get much cheaper than that. There are some subsidies for first-time Singaporean home-buyers: If both you and your spouse are first-time buyers, then you get a total subsidy of S\$30,000. But this is not a large subsidy. Some exceptional hardship cases (which involves an elaborate application process and onerous requirements) get to rent a small one-room flat for extremely cheap (as little as S\$26 a month), but these cases are so few in number as to be negligible. 

Then on p. 13, "stocks, bonds, and real estate" (which he defined earlier to be capital) are given to some Chinese-looking man on the left, who then gives back in turn $ \$ $ to the grouchy, jowly man in the middle, who then distributes this $ \$ $ either as savings or investment. Investment is depicted as some excavators constructing some buildings. The text below then claims, "People who 'buy capital' are investing their money." This is all terribly wrong and confusing: So what exactly is capital? Is it something that corresponds to the $ \$ $ symbol? Is it "stocks, bonds, and real estate"? Is it excavators or buildings? What is its relation to savings and investment? As already said above, capital refers to durable goods used to produce other goods and services. Investment in turn refers simply to the purchase of capital. 

I understand the above chart to mean that consumers were actually paid to use electricity. (Please correct me if I'm mistaken.) I was wondering how this is possible? How is the power/electricity market special and different from other markets? (Or perhaps the German electricity market is special.) 

In a 2007 article, Chang gives various examples of protectionism "working", including the US in the 19th century: 

In every instance, it is simply asserted without any evidence that the British/French governments egregiously and foolishly fell victim to the sunk-cost fallacy. But were the British/French governments actually guilty of the sunk-cost fallacy? Given the huge number of citations, I had myself assumed that Concorde was indeed a "classic" example of the sunk-cost fallacy that I could cite. I thought it would be very easy to find evidence that some British/French government officials were indeed guilty of the sunk-cost fallacy. (With another less well-known example of the sunk-cost fallacy — the Tenn-Tom Waterway project, I was easily able to find examples of several US government officials committing the sunk-cost fallacy.) However, in my brief investigation, I have been unable to find any for Concorde. Instead, I found this 29 Nov 1971 British memo expressing a very clear understanding of the concept of sunk costs and cautioning against falling for the sunk-cost fallacy. It began: 

So there are at least two discrepancies: 1. The BLS says that the total annual wages paid to 11,170 "Athletes and Sports Competitors" was less than $\$1$b. But in the four major professional sports leagues alone, over $\$12$b is paid out to 3,893 players. 2. The BLS says that the athlete at the 25th percentile (out of 11,170 workers) makes only $\$89,780$. This means that workers #1 — #2927 make $\$89,780$ or more, while workers #2928 — #11,170 make $\$89,780$. But in the four major professional sports leagues alone, 3,852 players make at least $\$100,000$. 

The table says, for example, that a total of 2,515 shots were taken by the 26 players, of which 1,175 or 46.72% were made. And of the 400 instances where a player missed 3 in a row, 161 or 40.25% were immediately followed by a hit. And of the 313 instances where a player hit 3 in a row, 179 or 57.19% were immediately followed by a hit. The above weighted averages seem to be strong evidence in favor of the hot hand. Bear in mind that the shooting experiment was set up so that each player was shooting from where it had been determined he/she could make roughly 50% of his/her shots. (Note: "Strangely" enough, in Table 1 for a very similar analysis with the Sixers' in-game shooting, GVT instead present the weighted averages. So why didn't they do the same for Table 4? My guess is that they certainly did calculate the weighted averages for Table 4 — the numbers I present above, didn't like what they saw, and chose to suppress them. This sort of behavior is unfortunately par for the course in academia.) 

I think the other answers' point about logistics is correct. But just to add another small insight: There is actually at least one airline that charges by weight: Samoa Air. Samoa is also one of the most obese countries in the world. So its passengers which include both Samoans and non-Samoans (120 kg Samoans and 50 kg Japanese) exhibit a great variation in weight. With such great variation, it may be worthwhile taking on the additional logistical/administrative costs of price-discriminating by weight. Like others have pointed out, there is actually price discrimination for shoe size, but done coarsely: Men, women, and children. Within each group, they generally don't bother to price-discriminate more finely (i.e. by shoe size). That's because most men will fall within a narrow range of shoe sizes. Same for women and children. So the logistical/admin costs of price-discriminating by exact shoe size may not be worthwhile. So perhaps in some country where there is very great variation in shoe size, it would also make sense to price-discriminate more finely. 

I imagine there are some transaction and administrative costs, but I don't see how these could explain the huge gap between the national average savings interest rate (0.09%) and the interest rate paid by the Fed to banks (1.50%). I do believe also that there is no limit to the reserves that banks can place with the Fed (though please correct me if I'm mistaken on this point). What am I missing here? Or: Why does this market deviate markedly from the perfectly competitive ideal? Some possible general explanations off the top of my head (but I suspect there may be other more specific institutional factors that I'm not aware of): 

Thereafter, the Concorde project would be frequently cited as a "classic" example of the sunk-cost fallacy. Examples: evolutionary biologists — Grafen and Sibly (1978), Dawkins and Brockmann (1980), Curio (1987), Arkes and Ayton (1999); economists — Höffler (2008), Ahlstrom and Bruton (2009), McAfee, Mialon, and Mialon (2010), Baliga and Ely (2011); media and blogs — Forbes (2011), The New Yorker (2013), Tim Taylor (2014), FEE (2015). The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (2013) writes: 

Whereas Snowdon and Vane (2005, p. 28) prefer to distinguish between 7 separate schools of thought "that have made a significant contribution to the evolution of twentieth-century macroeconomics", namely 

I interpret your question more broadly as one about whether protectionism has ever "worked". Two economists that think it has are Chang Ha-Joon and Dani Rodrik. You can therefore look up their work. Two arguments they use are: 

Definition. The opportunity cost (OC) of any alternative is the value you place on the best of the forgone alternatives. If we adopt the above definition (and I do), the OC of $B$ is the value of $A$, which is simply $\$100$. With the above definition, the alternative you choose ($B$ in this case) is completely irrelevant when calculating its OC. All that matters is the best of the forgone alternatives. To illustrate this point, consider this pair of examples: 

This was a highly-influential best-seller that has sold over 16M copies in over 30 languages. Take their example of gold. On p. 56, they calculate that if gold use continued growing exponentially AND there was 5 times as much gold available as there were known gold reserves (they thought this was a very optimistic assumption), gold would be depleted in 29 years, or in 2001. Surprisingly, 2001 came and went and gold continued to be mined. Indeed, more than ever. Gold mining graph (source): 

Then on p. 12, capital is depicted as businesses that are shipped off on boats from Iceland to Guatemala. 

For example, Singapore takes out "changes in official reserves" (ΔR) from the Financial Account and combines what is left of the FA with the CA into a single account called the Capital & Financial Account (KFA). And so for Singapore, the BOP identity can be written as: CA + KFA + ΔR = 0. And very confusingly, Singapore then defines BOP = CA + KFA = -ΔR. Hence, in Singapore, a BOP surplus refers to when there is an increase in official reserves (yes, strangely enough, ΔR < 0 ⇔ official reserves increase). And a BOP deficit is when there is a decrease in official reserves. Singapore's presentation of the BOP is actually not so unusual. The IMF BPM6 for example does suggest it as a possible alternative presentation of the BOP (see end of p. 224 and start of p. 225). However, I think it's pretty unusual to define the BOP as a number equal to -ΔR, as Singapore does. 

From my reading of the UN System of National Accounts (2008 update), "fixed assets" and "fixed capital" seem to be completely synonymous. Yet strangely there seem to be these two different terms. So what, if any, is the difference between them? I can find a definition for "fixed assets" but not for "fixed capital": 

Here is a somewhat standard presentation that might be taught in intermediate macroeconomics at US universities. Let $p_t$ be the price of a unit of capital at the end of period $t$. Suppose that production takes place at the start of each period. After production takes place, depreciation occurs. Let us say that the depreciation rate is constant at $\delta$. Let us also say that the real interest rate across any two consecutive periods is $r$. Assume also that the price of each unit of output is equal to $1. If so, we would expect that $p_1=\frac{1}{1+r}[MP^k_2+(1-\delta)p_2]$. This has a nice interpretation. The price of capital at the end of period 1 equals: The present discounted value of the additional output it can give us at the start of period 2, plus the after-depreciation resale value of that unit of capital at the end of period 2. We can write down an analogous expression for $p_2$: $p_2=\frac{1}{1+r}[MP^k_3+(1-\delta)p_3]$ Now substitute this latter expression for $p_2$ into our first equation above, to get: $p_1=\frac{1}{1+r} \left\{ [MP^k_2+(1-\delta)\frac{1}{1+r}[MP^k_3+(1-\delta)p_3] \right\}=\frac{1}{1+r}[MP^k_2+\frac{1-\delta}{1+r}MP^k_3+\frac{(1-\delta)^2}{1+r}p_3]$ This last expression has again a nice interpretation. The price of capital at the end of period 1 equals: The present discounted value of the additional output it can give us at the start of period 2, plus the additional output it can give us at the start of period 3, plus the resale value of that unit of capital at the end of period 3. If we keep going, plugging in expressions for $p_3$, $p_4$, ..., eventually we'll find that $p_1=\frac{1}{1+r}[MP^k_2+\frac{1-\delta}{1+r}MP^k_3+(\frac{1-\delta}{1+r})^2MP^k_4+(\frac{1-\delta}{1+r})^3MP^k_5+\dots]$ This has the desired result: The price of a unit of capital today is simply equal to the present value of the future stream of income that this unit of capital will generate, appropriately taking into account depreciation. This generalizes to a broader principle employed not just in standard macroeconomics but in the real world too: The price of any asset should be equal simply to the present value of the future stream of income that the asset will generate. 

Simple everyday examples of violations of transitivity are not difficult to come up with, but I'm having trouble thinking of some for the completeness axiom. One possible formulation of the completeness axiom in plain English:
