You are asking a question about culture, not philosophy. A given reprimand or intervention may have a good or a bad outcome. You have to ask, how will you feel if it is a bad outcome? In a previous era, children were given corporal punishment, and if they turned out criminal a punisher would say, at least I tried! Now in modern times, we would say, no wonder they turned out bad, it was the corporal punishment! Different people respond to boundary enforcement differently. We all need boundaries though. Look to the geist of your organisation. No one should be afraid of mirrors, apart from the dangers of over-absorption. It is among the oldest tenets to do as we would be done by. We learn through the action of mirror neurons, and are affected by the actions of others in a deep way. One of the deepest metaphors for teaching in Buddhism is holding up a mirror so the student lwarns from themselves. Always be showing the mirror. Being really present in the moment is very helpful. Often more can be done pointing put an error clearly as ot is made, than through say a formal meeting about a list of failings. Believe in the good spirit of others wherever you can, choose to believe they have good intentions unless they themselves disprove that. 

'Holes' are naming them as their own thing. Perforation is a property of the metal. This difference is not trivial, as can be seen in the Sorites Paradox, or indeed the Ship of Theseus. We have different types of language, and different types of discourse, and when we try to program computers to speak in natural language this is sharply highlighted. We can aim to reformulate language, which results in formal logics and mathematical languages. But there are costs there, GÃ¶del and various others have shown such formulation can't force all propositions to be decidable. But also, natural language allows us to do complex things we take for granted, like sponteneous metaphor, and onomatapeia, and to express different kinds of identity, mood, priorities, and motivations. Language games like that, may in fact be more fundamental to meaning than logic. 

The expansion of the universe is accelerating, so we expect a 'heat death', an essential static state of hydrogen atoms and photons getting ever further apart, with no variations in the part. So by most reasonable definitions, unchanging. More generally, there is finite entropy so things wind down and decay into stable states, barring intervention. 

Of course! You know theologians exist right? They are the biggest critics of 'godless' science. A big problem though is, how you define science. Several popes have said they accept science. The Dalai Lama says if any of the teachings of hus school of Buddhism are found in conflict with scientific findings, go with science. But these figures also hold many views which cannot be called scientific. It might seem easy to define science, but I assure you it isn't. Falsifiability, double-blind controlled trials, repeatability, direct observations, and any number of 'hall marks' of science are actually very much discipline dependent. Occam's Razor or Baconian Induction exclude many things now accepted as science or as scientifically true. The idea science is unified in it's methodsvand homogenous is just totally wrong. Popper developed his ideas on science specifically to stop Marxists saying historical materialism is scientific. It quickly gets political. And Dawkins and his ilk quickly resort to scientism, over truly scientific answers - which are after all very often, we don't and may never know; not a great crowd pleaser. Critics of science from outside, tend not to have informed enough opinions to be widely listened to, and from inside tend to be reformers. The same holds generally for religions. James Lovelock or Lyall Watson argue passionately for expanded methods and paradigms, but from within, broadly, the community. I can only think of religious figures, and fringe ones, calling for a dismissal of scientific results. Am thinking about how Foucault reinterpreted science in terms of power structures, and as influenced by and at least partly serving, biology, economics, and linguistics. So he certainly critiqued the idea that there is 'pure' science. Thomas Kuhn's thinking about science suggested developments within it are at leastbto some extebt subjective and relative, which could be considered a rejection of ideas many scientists have about science. Plenty of critics of aspects that may or may not be essential to science, like reductionism or positivism. 

Science extends sensory faculties, through collective development of tools from vacuum pumps to CERN, and regulation of the quality of reported results through peer review and academic prestige. The cultural whole of science is not only greater than the parts, but seems to be creating deeper global integration and allocating technology and access to resources in return for that, creating a positive feedback loop. Has anyone since Wittgenstein taken up the philosophical implications of this? Has anyone taken up the ideas of Kuhn & Popper and applied them like this? What does our eusociality and non-private aspects of language tell us about complex brains and how we know things? 

I am pretty suspicious about this story, and I don't like it. It's not a good example and it does not clearly demonstrate 'skillful means', the defining quality of Zen aimed at bringing students to direct insight with unconventional methods. It seems more like an excuse for bullying. Maybe there is more to the story, a transgression by the student, or a turning away from their 'wall' of lack of realisation for the distraction of 'pearls of wisdom' justifying an extreme method, but to me it sounds like bad Zen, a misconstrual or minterpretation of the method. The implication to a student of the story is only, stop following. One of the most controversial Zen stories about the posing of a koan, for the Zen community, is the story of Nansen and the cat. One of the five precepts taken to become a Buddhist is to abstain from violence. And the Buddha said in the parable of the saw "Monks, even if bandits were to savagely sever you, limb by limb, with a double-handled saw, even then, whoever of you harbors ill will at heart would not be upholding my Teaching." Nansen is said to have cut a cat in two with a sword. Good arguments have been made that the students were involved in a common argument for Buddhists, is it ethical to keep a cat that kills mice? Nansen goes directly to ending the interminable discussion. If you don't want the cat, do you want the mice? If you want the cat can you say a good word for it? Dogen, the great(est?) Japanese Zen master says Nansen did teach with this, but could have been more skillful, and gives an alternate way he would have taught without the cat dying. Similarly, breaking a students leg is not skilful, even if it 'works' and teaches the student a profound lesson. As last resort to avoid a wasted life not awakening, maybe. Does the story make it clear this is a last resort? No. It is a common perspective in the West that Zen stories and koans are interchangeable, and that any student can learn by contemplating any of them. Which makes a muddle of the whole thing. So some context. Koans and koan practice come out of the 'Transmission Of The Lamp' genre of writing, descriptions of the moment a master was recognised (and elements of their biography), that record the 'direct transmission from mind to mind' which creates the Zen lineage. They are directed at people knowledgable of the Buddhist Tripitakas and Zen literature, and often feature encounters with other spiritual practices like Daoism, or sophisticated reaction to and refinement of Zen doctrines - like Caodong's question about how insentient beings can preach the dharma or Dogen's question why Buddha came from the West. Koan practice is not about turning away from questioning, or abandoning the idea of answers, but in contemplating the defining moments of realisation of great masters a deep challanve is being undertaken. It is directed toward "A special transmission outside the scriptures; No dependence on words and letters; Direct pointing to the mind of man; Seeing into one's nature and attaining Buddhahood." (attributed to Boddhidharma, 1st patriarch of Zen) "For there is suffering, but none who suffers; Doing exists although there is no doer. Extinction is but no extinguished person; Although there is a path, there is no goer." - Visuddhimagga XVI 90. Not even a hobbling goer 

Just War Theory is about when institutional murder can be justified. 'Do Unto Others - ' presupposes being an accurate judge of what they would wish. Research shows a stable percentage of psycopaths across different societies, probably because when well adjusted this provides key benefits, to surgeons, some business roles, in the military etc $URL$ But not good for empathy. It is interesting that right wing folk tend to be the most vocally Christian, somehow easily reconciling contradictions between what they call for and actual commandments from Jesus. I would point to the phenomena of post hoc rationalisation, that people reason from values, not consequences $URL$ So more broadly, I would say both commandments offer very little guidance in practice. 

Electron orbits would then be 'unactualised'. Many quantum phenomena 'reach' in their uncollapsed state, like a particle in a potential well tunnelling through a barrier it shouldn't be able to cross. A probability wave represents many points, a detection or interaction one, so collapse is not entirely innappropriate. 

You seem to have got off on the wrong foot, by comparing observing, to force. For an example of a classical account of the effects of observation, look at $URL$ The key is accounting for information transfer and persistence, not force. The next problem, is the nature of the superposition of states. An observer, by definition, collapses such a superposition into a definite state by taking an observation. That doesn't neccessarily stop the 'observer' being subatomic, or quantum mechanical, just not in a superposition. Quantum superpositions can interact with each other, making a combined superposition. Observation always means collapse of the wave function and information out into the wider world about it's state. Also, you are using the word symmetry in a suspect way. You can say Newton's third law states a symmetrical reaction. But symmetry in general related to forces, is likely to be taken as gauge symmetry. 

Descartes is at very different purposes with his Evil Demon than the role of maya or the simulation hypothesis. Descartes places primacy on mental experience, which makes the regularities in the material world problematic - which he accounts for with the mentality of a deity, an inevitable consequence of substance dualism (but not property dualism). It may appear that theism is not essential to Cartesian dualism, but it makes the unity of the external world at the very least require the 'god of the philosophers', or deism. Materialism or physicalism, places primacy on material experiences, which makes accounting for subjective experience or qualia problematic, resulting in the Hard Problem of Consciousness. Maya is translated as 'pretence' or 'deceit', a negative mental quality like lust. In Buddhism, conventional experience is always founded in misconceptions, is always a kind of dream or illusion. There is no other kind of subjective or self-identifying experience. Delusion, craving, suffering, and the arising of causal chains and identity, are seen as of a piece, in the chain of dependent arising. There is no true unity in the external world, except in what is regular in the nature of minds and their shared history together or codependent arising. Descartes says there is this thinking I, which he already makes assumptions about the capacities of - such as access to apriori concepts. Buddhism says, whatever locus of experience there is, that is the self. And then by reflection and direct experiencd, identifies that there being a locus for events is in fact an illusion. The former cannot deal with the Private Language Argument. The latter prefigures it (imho). "David Chalmers has argued that we should consider the 'simulation hypothesis' not as a skeptical hypothesis that threatens our having knowledge of the external world but as a metaphysical hypothesis regarding what our world is actually made of. " $URL$ (discussed here Are we living in a simulation? The evidence). This can be used to reconcile subjective mental experience, and the experience of a shared external world, such as through the Peer-To-Peer Reality idea - very like Indra's Net, a model of mind and reality shared by Hindu and Buddhist thinkers. So, Descartes is wrong not because he can't be sure they are his thoughts, but because he can't have the conceptual notion of a self without an inheritence, without a prconception of a shared and collectively generated reality. In Buddhism this is called karma, and can be analysed for instance as Eight Consciousnesses (very similar to Aristotle's three souls).You thinking about it, is you being a self - so using thought can never unpick your being or negate any existence. It's like using a telescope to try and look at itself. In meditation you first try and see how clear is the lense, then about why you feel motivated to turn the telescope to certain things, then you put the telescope down and see what happens. This is not using thoughts to look at thoughts, creating thinking-self. It is observing, settling, observing, just watching what your mind does without pushing it anywhere. 

I find his point in quite interesting, though I take the opposite implication. Because, we have the sense of being a unique thing with unique thoughts skills etc. but really we are just a composite of causes and conditions, inheriting genes and a body which precede our ability to shape who we are. Dawkins is fully aware there is some 'nurture' in the picture, that identical twins differentiate - and say Hawking may have needed the condition he found himself in to make excel in the way he did. But is also the case that a lot is determined by genes, they form a landscape of variables, and someone essentially almost exactly like you may have already been born, may be born again. Not just a similar body, but a gene-determined 'psycological body', of impulsivity, emotional dynamics etc. $URL$ 

Descartes chose extensibility (or not, with ideas). Searle laid out his argument for qualia in the Chinese Room argument. Quantum mechanics and relativity both seem to distinguish between energy and the propagation of information by it. Should we be convinced? Scientific consensus is for ontological monism, founded in property dualism (converse to substance dualism), so assuming the scientific community are our paragons, we should be convinced. The Buddhist perspective takes the opposite tack, that rather than 'the substance' being matter, it is Mind (actually only the Mind Only school of Yogacara hold this, but it is the most philosophically sophisticated approach probably, and influencial on the largest cohort of Buddhists - Chinese & Tibetan). This tack greatly simplifies understanding the emergence of law-based complexities that are minds, but greatly complicates understanding the law-based complexities of matter. Arguably materialism or physicalism does the opposite.
