The way to get the demand curve is by deriving the utility function. First, the utility function needs to be defined. $E(u)=(u(0)(r)+u(200)(1-r))$ In this case, the expected utility is the utility of spending \$0 on the fare vs the utility if you get a \$200 fine. in this case, r is the probability of getting away with it. If this is greater than the utility of paying the fare, the fare will be evaded. $E(u)=(u(0)r+u(200)(1-r))\geq {u(5)}$ The exact utility function can take many forms. Popular choices are Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion (DARA), Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA) or others. Wikipedia is OK on this. The next steps in this analysis are to decide on a utility function. You will need inputs on risk of getting caught and fines. After defining the utility function you will be able to derive the demand curve. You will also need to define the supply curve. If the fare is something like a train ride, you may be able to set up the marginal cost=0. That allows you to only worry about the fixed cost. A useful resource will be the wiki article mentioned earlier. This Mas Collel book is a very popular graduate text. I think it treats risk aversion relatively well, although I did find it not incredibly accessible. 

So the following is not a textbook, but it is a long and informative chapter on search-and-matching models from two experts in labor-macro: Rogerson and Shimer, 2010: $URL$ 

This goes on a tangent for this question here, but Chevalier and Kashyap criticize the basket that the CPI collects. To summarize, their point is that the basket is immune to sales: Holding goods in the basket constant while a seizable fraction of the population is hunting cheaper goods overestimates actual inflation, and vice versa in the "no sales" periods. 

As you can see, for every unique household member (every hhid-hhid2-lineno combination), there is only one row. And if its somehow stored in the wide format, I'd expect the name to contain 'emp' somewhere: 

Take a cont. diff, convex and increasing cost function $c(X)$. Say you start with a stock $K$, and want to (dis)invest $I$. Many adjustment cost functions (for example, the first example on page 2 here) then are of the type $$ K c\left(\frac{I}{K}\right)$$ What is the purpose of scaling investment costs with $K$ here? Marginal cost of investment is $$ c'\left(\frac{I}{K}\right)$$ It seems that this gives the property that marginal cost of investment decreases in existing capital stock. Is this observed in the real world, or does it rather simplify computations? Are there (popular) alternative formulations of adjustment costs? 

The key model in urban economics is the monocentric model, which is a derivation of the rural land price theory and has industry concentrated in the central business district (CBD). Start with closed model (a city in isolation). Then look at the open model (allow for movement between cities) and competition between cities (inter - regional equilibrium). Density and distribution of population and sectors. Interaction with the labour market – why wages are higher in larger ‘skilled’ cities but real wages are not. This model has extensions which can help explain why some industries choose to operate outside of the CBD. There are some special considerations often used for analysis of property: 

Very extensive. Worth having as a reference at least because it covers an enourmous set of models and estimation techniques. It is a little bit light on the intuition though. Also, a kindle edition is available which is a lot cheaper than the very expensive hard cover 

A nerd loves both mathematics and physics equally, and hates sports and drinking beer equally. A football player hates both mathematics and physics equally, and loves sports and drinking beer equally. The nerd and the football player have the same indifference curves, but not the same preferences. The point is this: Both agree on the "grouping" of things. But they disagree in the ranking of the groups. Your Example If you look at Jim and Pat, they have exactly inverse utility functions and hence inverse ranking in their preferences. That is, if for Jim $A > B = C = D > E$, Pat will have $A < B = C = D < E$. Both agree on the three groups, but disagree on the order. Jerry's just a monotone transformation (poor Jerry). 

If you believe that workers really are setting the wage and there is some stickiness in their ability to do so, (i) is the way to go. If you believe it is important that employment comes after some matching-period, and wages are set through bargaining from both employers and employees, extending DMP would be a better way. Fundamentally, if you believe that you could use DMP, but it has some clutter that you don't need, get rid of that first, and then add your price-stickiness. 

I came across this presentation which attempts to model something very similar to the question asked. Here is the full article It uses the VAT instead of the GST but they are basically equivalent. Abstract 

There are many different models used in this field, depending on the question being asked. For example, commercial and residential properties have very different needs. That said, there is a key model which can be the framework for a broad analysis: 

A massive simplification would to look at developed (high wage) countries as experiencing two forces. There is the offshoring pathway. Low skill manufacturing can be offshored to lower waged countries. Output in the home country decreases. Then there is the technological pathway. Automation and innovations can work to take the bottom out of employment, saving on wage costs. Manufacturing will become increasingly dependent on a more skilled employee. Output in the home country increases. The expected trend is one away from the low skill manufacturing (think clothing) towards more complex, bespoke products (think 3D printed prosthetics). The overall environment is notably more complicated with government subsidies, global supply chains and trade deals among others things all being important. Deloitte Access Economics have released a manufacturing competitiveness report which covers elements of this. 

Note that the last point is really the only supply-side story. If you ignore super stars, the supply of good players is huge. Most of the twist really comes from some of them being marginally better / lucky, making it into the better leagues, which happen to be the one that mass media demand, and get the high compensation. 

Guvenen et al look at earnings shocks over time, and try to argue whether these are compatible with standard career-ladder models with normal shocks. However, their data is no real shocks, it is time differences in labor earnings. We do not know which part of these were expected. What are things to consider if one tries to take into account for the fact that these income changes are - to some extent - expected ex ante? My first guess would be that since people expect future rise in income, correcting the "shocks" for that would mean that the unexpected part of the shocks is to the left of their yearly changes in wage income. That is, there are more shocks downwards than upwards. 

If you are thinking of something like an app, consider non monetary costs. They operate in the same way. Like the time value of playing a worse app. or movies, if you are given a choice to watch a terrible movie for free or pay to see a good movie, you may elect to pay. In which case time is a factor. You can't consume an infinite amount of terrible movies at time $t$. In summary, you need to add more to the question. If a good is free, marginal utility has to diminish and $\frac{du}{dx}$ needs to equal $0$ at some point or supply has to be finite. Until at least that is satisfied, the consumer will spend all money on on $x_2$ and hold an infinite amount of $x_1$ 

The HO model has been generalised. Vanek does a good job of it. Instead of only two countries, there is an index of countries. 

Which means that I only have to download the CEPR ORG data. Sounds like good news. I downloaded 2013 and 2014 from here. corresponds to the monthly interview, the variable has unique values and (which are the outgoing interview months). So far, so good. There is an variable which appears to encode employment status. However, I cannot find the employment status for other months than the interview months. I can't find neither additional rows, which would carry that information in long form, nor additional columns, which could carry it in wide form. Here's how some data extract (restricting some columns and rows) looks: 

A similar thing exists with credit cards, which both facilitate the payment process and also make people care less about the amounts they're spending [reference needed]. 

I am interested in two variables $x, y$. Their (observed empirical) standard deviations are $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$. I know the elasticity of $x$ w.r.t. $y$ is $\eta_{x,y}$. Let $x$ be fully determined through $y$, which is the only source of randomness. Is it true that $$ \frac{\sigma_x}{mean(X)} = \eta_{x,y} \cdot \frac{\sigma_y}{E[y]}$$ ? I can't find anything on this relationship, but it appears that appropriately scaled standard deviations of two variables should be connected through their elasticity. 

A point I am trying to make here is that exponential growth is really just the size of something as a function of itself in a different state or time frame. If you want exponential growth over a longer timeframe, it makes sense to extend the model. What if $r$ was endogenous to the model? As Y gets larger, r gets smaller. Still growing exponentially, and the size of the economy in $t+1$ is still dependent on the size of the economy in $t$. 

Inflation $$\frac{P_1-P_0}{P_0}$$ Where $P_t$ is the price level at time $t$ This formula is just the percentage change in price. GDP Growth From Investopedia: 

Cities offer advantages and disadvantages. Amenities are more available (both publicly and privately provided) but there are also negative externalities such as congestion, pollution and cost of living. 

Your question is long and unclear. I suggest editing it to get a better response. I hope you do because I think it has good potential. I am able to help with one element of the question. "is crowd mentality in ranking better than one's own ranking system?" The answer to this really depends on what your own ranking system is. The Wisdom of the Crowd is pretty good at this sort of stuff. That said, I think there is definitely room in something like fantasy football to beat the crowd generated rankings. I find when I am looking for a probabilistic outcome on something like that, a bookmakers site should be one of the first ports of call.
