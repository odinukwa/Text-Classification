I am considering a real Lie group $G$ acting transitively on an open set $U$ in a real Euclidean space of lower dimension. Given a smooth, compactly supported function $f: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and some $v \in U$, I need to explicitly determine a function $h: U \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for which $$ \int_G f(gv) dg = \int_{x \in U} h(x) dx.$$ I basically know how to do this; that's not my question. However, while attempting to chase down an error in my computation it occurred to me that I had never seen anything similar before. Surely these are common and standard, but I don't know where to look. Can anyone recommend books or papers with typical and/or particularly clear examples of similar computations? Thank you! 

The notation ${}^t g$ for the transpose of a linear transformation is, in my view, quite unusual: otherwise (at least in many areas of math), one almost never sees subscripts or superscripts appearing on the left. Although $g^t$ strikes me as a more natural choice of notation, I have noticed that the notation ${}^t g$ seems to be the "highbrow" choice, especially common whenever linear transformations are being emphasized rather than matrices. Is there any reason for this other than historical accident? 

I am looking for a reference for the following fact which must be classical (which makes it harder, for me, to track a reference down). I am interested because there are similar (more complicated) statements about the cohomology of symmetric groups. If $P$ is a partition, namely $p_{1} + \cdots + p_{k} = n$, we let $\rho_{P}$ denote the permutation representation of $S_{n}$, induced up from the trivial representation of $S_{P}$. If $P$ and $Q$ are partitions of $n$ then consider any matrix $\hat{A}$ with nonnegative integer entries such that the entries of $i$th row of $A$ add up to $p_{i}$ and those of the $j$th column of $A$ add up to $q_{j}$. Then the entries of $\hat{A}$ form another partition of $n$, which we call $A$ and say that $A$ is a product-refinement of $P$ and $Q$. For example if $P = Q = 1 + 2$ then two possibilities for $\hat{A}$ are $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. Proposition: If $\rho_{P}$ and $\rho_{Q}$ are permutation representations of $S_n$ then $\rho_{P} \otimes \rho_{Q} \cong \bigoplus_{A} \rho_{A},$ where the sum is over $A$ which are product-refinements of $P$ and $Q$. Questions: 1) what is the reference for this fact? and 2) what is standard terminology (for product-refinement in particular)? 

While reading a number theory paper I encountered the identity $$ \int_{- \infty}^{\infty} (1 + x^2)^{ - \frac{z}{2} - 1} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \frac{ \Gamma(\frac{z + 1}{2}) }{\Gamma(\frac{z}{2} + 1)},$$ apparently true for all $z \in \bf{C}$ for which the integral on the left converges absolutely. The author offers neither a justification nor a citation, so apparently this is 'well known'. I thought of two ideas for how to prove it: (1) Use integration by parts to prove that both sides satisfy the same functional equation, and then attempt to adapt the proof of the Bohr-Mollerup theorem to prove that this functional equation characterizes the function; (2) use integration by parts to analytically continue the left-side function in $z$, determine all the poles and their residues, and attempt to use Weierstrass factorization to prove that this characterizes the function. Both approaches looked rather involved and I didn't attempt to work out the details of either. Is this, indeed, 'well known'? Is there a suitable reference which proves this, along with other identities of this nature? And to what extent does the identity generalize? 

Here's how I explain Steenrod squares to geometers. First, if $X$ is a manifold of dimension $d$ then one can produce classes in $H^n(X)$ by proper maps $f: V \to X$ where $V$ is a manifold of dimension $d-n$ through many possible formalisms - eg. intersection theory (the value on a transverse $n$-cycle is the count of intersection points), or using the fundamental class in locally finite homology and duality, or Thom classes, or as the pushforward $ f_*(1)$ where $1$ is the unit class in $H^0(V)$. Taking this last approach, suppose $f$ is an immersion and thus has a normal bundle $\nu$. If $x = f_*(1) \in H^n(X)$ then $Sq^i(x) = f_*(w_i(\nu))$. This is essentially the Wu formula. That is, if cohomology classes are represented by submanifolds, and for example cup product reflects intersection data, then Steenrod squares remember normal bundle data. 

I have been trying to make sure that my daughter hears me say with some frequency "I don't know (but I'm curious)" and "I'm wrong (but I'd like to know what's right)," since that's the best way for her to learn to say these things when appropriate. Looking in the big picture well beyond math, the world would be a better place if people would say those things more frequently. But math is one of the best places to come to terms with these sentiments (which is one of the many reasons some people dislike it). Children are sometimes OK with not knowing, but hate being wrong. I don't want my daughter to have the impression that I know everything, so I'm really happy when she asks science questions I don't have good answers for. That's not going to happen in math for a while, but I will sometimes intentionally lead her astray and push along until she catches me - that has a big element of fun to it (she gives me these looks when she starts to suspect me) and catching me being wrong is a step, I think, in her developing the ability to catch her own mistakes. 

+1 to Micah, read his answer first! As an addendum, the $L$-function of an elliptic curve looks like (and is) an $L$-function of degree 2. It has a certain conductor, which is defined in terms of the primes of bad reduction and which affects the analytic behavior of the $L$-function. But beyond that, there is unfortunately not a lot that is known from an analytic perspective for elliptic curve $L$-functions in particular. Once it is proved that they have analytic continuation and a functional equation, knowledge of where the $L$-function came from seems to be disappointingly useless for proving theorems. (With some exceptions, e.g., the value of the critical point; there is also the modularity theorem, etc. but I am not regarding that as "analytic".) There is a lot of general machinery, which is very well explained in Chapter 5 of Iwaniec and Kowalski for general $L$-functions in general. Beyond that, my impression (which could be mistaken) is that not a whole lot is known. 

Yes. Sieve methods are much better at proving upper bounds than lower bounds. By the Selberg sieve, or alternatively using the combinatorial sieve, you can prove that the number of Chen primes is bounded above by $C_2 N/\log^2 N$ for some particular value of $C_2$. (ed: Please see Terry Tao's important caveat below, which I neglected in my initial answer.) I don't know the details offhand; it would take some work to determine a particular value of $C_2$, but this is definitely possible. The Selberg sieve is probably easiest, you can read, for example, Halberstam and Richert. (Just read the first chapter on the Selberg sieve -- no need to delve into the more difficult portions of the book.) 

Let me elaborate on part of Tyler's answer, and "second" the importance of constructing examples yourself in a setting where that is feasible, namely that of bicomplexes. Even though as you say they seem more algebraic, they do come up in topology (as I note below) and you can "see everything" in first examples. Here's what I usually suggest to my students (often in or right after a first-year course). Exercise: Show that the bicomplex with entries of ${\bf k}$ (the ground ring) at (0,1), (1,1), (1,0) and (2,0) and all horizontal and veritcal differentials given by identity maps is acyclic, but the spectral sequence obtained by taking homology vertically first has a non-trivial $E^2$ page and a non-trivial $d_2$ differential which kills that $E^2$ page. Exercise: Construct bicomplexes with arbitrarily long differentials. Playing with these for a while you see what's going on, but they might seem too algebraic/ artificial. Here's something which you can understand at almost the same level of detail but which computes something interesting. Definition: Let $A \bigoplus A^i$ be a differential graded associative algebra (that is, a cochain complex with an associative multiplication for which the differential is governed by the Leibniz rule), defined in non-negative degrees with say $H^0(A) = {\bf k}$. Then Bar(A), the bar construction on $A$, is the bicomplex which in bidegree (-p, q) is the degree $q$ part of $\overline{A}^{\otimes p}$ - which we denote $a_1 | a_2 | \cdots | a_p$ (you can pretend at first that $\overline{A}$ is just $A$ - really, $\overline{A}$ agrees with $A$ in degrees two and greater, is 0 in degree zero, and in degree one we replace $A^1$ by $A^1/ im(d)$). The vertical differential is the standard one on $A^{\otimes p}$ (using the Leibniz rule to extend to the tensor product), and the horizontal differential is defined as a sum obtained by "removing bars and multiplying." Let ${\bf k}$ be $F_2$ if you don't want to worry about signs. Exercise: Show this is a bicomplex. If you're brave, do so with signs. Exercise: The spectral sequence for this bicomplex obtained by taking homology vertically first has $E^1$ given by $Bar(H_*(A))$, where the homology of $A$ is a differential graded algebra with zero differential. (This is an immediate application of one of the main theorems from a first algebraic topology course.) Theorem (Eilenberg-Moore, after Adams-Hilton): If $X$ is simply connected and $A$ is (quasi-isomorphic to) the cochains of $X$, then the homology of $Bar(A)$ is isomorphic to the cohomology of the loopspace of $X$. Exercises: first compute for $A$ with all products zero. Then compute when $A$ is a free associative algebra, and then free commutative algebra. Finally, try to make examples with higher differentials. (I might elaborate more later... and we can talk at the Cascade seminar this week-end). 

I will be teaching Calculus 2 this fall at a large U.S. state university. Our incoming students tend to have a limited or inconsistent background, which limits the amount of material we can cover. Previously at my university, instructors have given sequences and series a very thorough treatment, including all the usual tests for convergence (ratio, root, alternating series, comparison, integral, etc.). For lack of time, important subjects such as topics such as arc length, parametric equations, polar coordinates, etc. have had to be dropped or abbreviated. I want to cover these subjects, and therefore am looking for something else to cut. It seems possible to give an abbreviated treatment of sequences and series: cover the basics, do only the Ratio Test, and then teach Taylor and Maclaurin series. The students will be able to determine the radius of convergence, although perhaps not the endpoints. Have people tried this approach previously? And are there disadvantages to such an approach, apart from the ones which can be easily foreseen? Thanks. 

I have a unique and, quite truthfully, humbling opportunity. The parents of an exceptionally talented high school freshman have reached out to me and asked if I might be able to help. This kid is seriously good; he came to our state high school math contest and blew away the competition. He is active in a local Math Circle and is in extremely capable hands, and his parents inform me that he is extremely active in the Art of Problem Solving and the Worldwide Online Olympiad Training program. I think my role, insofar as I could help, would be to introduce him to advanced topics and/or research. I am thinking about suggesting to him that he read Apostol's intro book on analytic number theory, or Stillwell's Naive Lie Theory; he might also enjoy some serious combinatorics and/or learning about the partition function. (Or, ... ?) Does anyone have any suggestions for helping such a student? Thank you! -Frank 

I have recently been doing some calculations in topology which are naturally expressed in terms commutative ring objects in the category of cocommutative coalgebras. These have been studied for quite a while - initially by Milgram and Ravenel-Wilson since they arise in studying homology of ring spectra - and go by the name "Hopf rings" (for better or worse). I'd like to make the calculations more "meaningful" if possible so my question is: how much of commutative algebra has been reproduced for ring objects in categories other than vector spaces sets? For some suitably nice categories C, hopefully including cocommutative coalgebras, do ring objects in C have analogues of ideals/modules, dimension, Spec, localization,...? I realize this is open-ended, but if there is existing work along any of these lines it would be nice to look and see if the ring objects I am considering fit in with and are illuminated by such a framework. Since (an interesting subset of) cocommutative Hopf algebras are given by group objects in the category of cocommutative coalgebras, one would suspect that this category's ring objects are also particularly nice but I am not aware of any such general development.
