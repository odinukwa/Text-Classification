The news media recently reported that galaxy GN-z11, formed just 400 million years after the big bang, is much further away than originally thought at perhaps 13.2 billion light years. They say, 

From another question I posted, I learned that not only was matter created from the Big Bang, but more importantly, space itself. What does it mean for space to be created? Does it exist in the same way substances exist? In other words, what do we mean by 'space exists?' 

So, suppose I'm standing next to, but safely away from, some train tracks. As the train approaches, sounding its whistle constantly, the pitch will appear to increase until it reaches me, upon which I will briefly hear the whistle's 'rest pitch' (the pitch of the whistle as if I were aboard the train), then it would decrease as the train moves away. Thus, the lower the pitch, the further away the train is. I hope that's right. So, if we know the rest frequency of galaxy GN-z11, its measured frequency indicates how far away it is from earth. Trouble is, how do we know what the rest frequency of light coming from this distant galaxy is? 

I just had a conceptual question, hopefully it makes for some really interesting answers. I was wondering, as most galaxies have an SMBH at their centre (see Kormandy & Richstone 1995; Richstone et al. 1998), could dark matter accrete onto the SMBH over time (perhaps perturbed by a galaxy collision, interaction or merger) and then recycle this matter as energy? Can dark matter help an SMBH grow? 

Sirius is in Canis Major, and if you take the belt of Orion to be the reference point then we can proceed as follows. If we define Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka as going left to right as we perceive it to be in the Northern Hemisphere, then we need to draw a line going from Mintaka in a SW-ish (left and down) orientation through Alnitak to Canis Major. You should see it. It's coming up to the best time of year to see Sirius and the Orion constellation. N.B. I'm pretty certain what you are referring to as the object you're seeing at this present moment is Venus. 

This question relates to a diffuse hot gas halo of our Milky Galaxy. I've read that there is a hot diffuse halo of gas surrounding our Galaxy (NED, Caltech) I was wondering why such a halo can exist? Why doesn't it collapse to a disk shape? Is it because the gas itself is still hot and so remains largely unaffected by the Galaxy potential? 

The acceleration of the universe is written as $\dot{H}$, where $H$ is the Hubble Rate (today, the Hubble Rate is given the name the Hubble Constant, $H_0$, and is given the value of 70 km/s/106pc). The Friedmann Equation can be simplified to the form: $$\dot{H} + H^2 = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho + \frac{3p}{c^2}\right)$$ Where $\rho$ is the density, and $p$ is the pressure. $G$ is the gravitational constant, and $c^2$ is the speed of light. Now, to find the acceleration, simply substitute the relavent values into the equation below: $$\dot{H_0} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\left(\rho_0 + \frac{3p_0}{c^2}\right) - H^2_0$$ I will try to find the relavent values, but as the previous answer says, the value is roughly $-10^{-17}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ 

However, this article sources its information from the website Physics Astronomy, a blog-type website which posts various articles on astronomical topics. Since Physics Astronomy doesn't seem to be a particularly reputable source, I will take this information with a pinch of salt. So, is this article true? Will you be able to see the Perseids in the daytime with the naked eye this year? 

In 1.5 million years, the star Gliese 710 is expected to pass through the Oort cloud. Now obviously this will shower the inner solar system with comets, but the Wikipedia page doesn't say anything about the star's impact on the orbits of the planets. Will the star not throw the Earth and other planets into highly elliptical orbits, destroying all life? Or, simply, do we not know because this would involve solving the 11-body problem? 

I would hazard a guess at this point, but effects of gravitational red-shift would perhaps average out, so approximately 50% of light would orginate from objects with stronger gravitational fields and 50% from weaker gravitational fields. Hence, we would see blue-shifted and red-shifted objects if gravitational redshift is an prominent as assumed. However, with the exception of the local group (where due to being gravitationally bound M33, Andromeda and ourselves are all moving towards each other), most of the extragalactic objects we observe have a redshift. Hence, the Doppler effect must be dominating. 

Just a question I am having trouble understanding. I have the Schechter luminosity function for galaxies, given as: $$\Phi(L)dL=\Phi_{0}\left({\frac{L}{L_{\star}}}\right)^{\alpha}e^{-\frac{L}{L_{\star}}}\frac{dL}{L_{\star}}$$ I need to consider the case when $\alpha=-1$. And then show that the average luminosity of a galaxy is exactly $L_{\star}$. Could somebody explain how I could go about doing this and perhaps a hint or some part of a setup would be excellent. I really need to understand this. Another part, which is related to the above question, is asking me to explain why the total luminosity is a finite number, whereas the total number of galaxies diverges. By this does it mean that the total number is infinite? Any extra comments on this would also be really appreciated. 

The word we use to refer to what's inside the cosmic horizon is the 'universe', so what would you call the empty space outside of the horizon? 

Where the Y axis is brightness (ranging from 100% to 0%) and the X axis is $d$ (ranging from $2r$ to $0$). I hope this answers your question: the brightness does not change proportionally to coverage/time. Note: This assumes that $d$ increases linearly with time (the moon doesn't speed up or slow down as it moves across the Sun). 

My telescope's sidereal tracking is lousy: it just doesn't work. To overcome this, when taking long-exposure photographs through it, what's the best way to reduce star trailing? 

How does the bar in a barred spiral galaxy form? What prevents it from being spirals all the way down like water spiralling down a plughole? 

Recently I bought a couple of books on cosmology from a second-hand bookshop. One was published in 1993 and the other is from the 1970. I know, from a recent book, that the inflaton theory is probably newer than both books and that the Higgs Boson has been discovered, but that is all that I know has changed recently in the field of cosmology. Has anything else changed since then? Which topics of the books should I understand are considered outdated? 

The title pretty much explains this one. Can I use a specific solar optical eye piece, or other optical device, in conjunction with the pinhole projector method to focus the Transit of Mercury? Would anyone have any specific recommendations for specifications, etc if it is possible to achieve this... 

I'm quite certain that there isn't any actual images of a transitory event of Jupiter or Saturn across the solar disk from say e.g.,s the Voyager probe, Pioneer 10/11 or even recent New Horizons mission? Another related question I have, what would the approximate transit of Jupiter look like as seen from Saturn. The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is approximately 4-5AU, and the diameter of Jupiter is one tenth that of the Sun's. Are we looking at perhaps a transit which covers 10-15% of the solar disk? N.B. Please note I understand that to observe a transit of Jupiter we have to be superior to it in the Solar System, hence I am asking for images taken by deep Solar System probes only. 

It is very hard to tell whether we are in a unique Universe. The difficulty is the closer we attempt to probe in the fractions of a nano second after the Big Bang our current forumlations of Gravity and the three our fundamental forces do not work. So it is very hard to tell whether our Universe is unique. However, with all that said, my own personal belief is that our Universe is not unique. The estimated time for random quantum fluctuations to generate a new Big Bang as quoted in the page that you have referred to is an UNIMAGINELY large time scale. My question I will pose back to you is, how could we ever tell we are a unique Universe, or part of a collection of Universes? 

Is there a way to take the red shift of an object and, from that, calculate a rough estimate of its distance from us (in parsecs, preferably)? 

As the comments have said, this is simply a camera effect known as a lens flare If you look around at the various bright stars, you can see this in multiple places, e.g.: 

I want to write a program which, when given a date, a time, latitude and longitude, returns a list of the planets, Messier objects and NCC catalogue objects what are visible in the sky at that time and place? Are there any APIs which can do this or would I have to calculate the positions? Preferably, this should be accessible using JavaScript 

I am wanting to plot a velocity profile (a plot of velocity against the star's distance from the galactic core) from the Gaia DR2, but so far my efforts have been disappointing. The information I have for each star are the declination ($\delta$), right ascension ($\alpha$), radial velocity ($v_r$), parallax ($\theta_\text{parallax}$) and proper motion ($\mu$) (ra and dec). I tried to calculate the star's distance from the galactic core using the cosine rule: $$ d = \frac{1000}{\theta_{\text{parallax}}}$$ $$\theta = \arccos{[\sin{\delta_\text{star}}\sin{\delta_\text{core}} + \cos{\delta_\text{star}}\cos{\delta_\text{core}}\cos{(\alpha_\text{star}-\alpha_\text{core})}]}$$ $$ r = \sqrt{d_\text{core}^2+ d^2 - 2d \times d_\text{core} \times \cos{\theta}} $$ Where $d$ is the distance from the Sun to the star. $d_\text{core}$ is the distance from the Sun to the galactic core. $\theta$ is the angular separation of the star and the galactic core. $r$ is the distance from the star to the core. And the star's speed using the equations: $$\mu = \sqrt{\mu_\text{dec}^2 + \mu_\text{ra}^2}$$ $$ v_t = 4.7 \mu d $$ $$ v = \sqrt{v_r^2 + v_t^2} $$ But the plot doesn't show any kind of trend (just a kind of blob). Have I calculated correctly and, if not, how could I calculate the tangential velocities and radius from the galactic core? Basically, I want to make the kind of plot that helps us identify dark matter in galaxies. 

I'm designing an amateur astronomy observational plan for GCSE Astronomy students here in the UK. I would like some advise to the suitability of what I have selected as the content. 

I have a homework assignment question on accretions discs (essentially an estimation of the number of electron scatterings, but this is just for background). There are a few parameters, one of them being $L$, which is the linear size of the medium (the medium in this case being an accretion disc around a blackhole) Now, I have been given the mass of the black hole. Other than that, nothing else which could give me the linear size of the accretion disc. Could I assume that the linear extent of the accretion disc is perhaps of the order of a few Schwarzschild radii? Which could be calculated from the mass, which is given. If anyone could shed some light on this I would be very appreciative. I need a nudge in the right direction on this. 

Hopefully the title is very self-explanatory. I was wondering if there were any non-stellar objects, such as bright galaxies, which when looking with the naked eye were mistaken for stars in the time when asterisms were documented and catalogued... For example, within the Big Dipper I believe it is Mizar which is in fact a binary star system. (Correct me if I am wrong!) I was hoping perhaps for distant yet bright Messier objects being mistaken for stars... 

Assuming the intensity of the sunlight is proportional to the area of the Sun which is showing, we can roughly calculate the intensity of sunlight, $I(d)$ as: $$I(d) = 1 - \frac{\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}}}{\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{Sun}}}$$ Where $\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}}$ is the overlap between the Moon and the Sun (the green area). $URL$ Some calculation finds the overlap to be: $$\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{overlap}} = 2r^2\cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d}{2r}\right) - \frac{d}{2}\sqrt{4r^2 - d^2}$$ Where $d$ is the distance between the centres of the Moon and the Sun. Similarly, the area of the Sun is: $$\mathrm{Area}_{\mathrm{Sun}} = \pi r^2$$ Putting this together, you get the graph: 

The two books are Modern Cosmology by Jagjit Singh (published 1961 and rereleased in 1970) and Afterglow of Creation by Marcus Chown (published in 1993) 

I've recently become interested in the idea of building my own small-scale radio telescope. A quick online search finds a few instructions on how to build this using a satellite dish. These suggest a dish of radius of around 1 metre, but the only objects that you seem to be able to detect are the Sun, the Earth, the Moon (possibly) and communications satellites. This sounds like it would be become boring fairly quickly, and I would like to observe some deep-sky objects. Some example objects that I fancy observing (depending on how strong their signals are) are Betelgeuse/Sirius, the Crab Nebula and the Andromeda Galaxy. N.B. I am quite satisfied with pointing the dish at an object and the signal strength increasing. I don't expect to get any kind of image. Evidently, you cannot pick these up using a metre-wide dish, so what is the minimum size required to pick up these objects (noting that I can't exactly build Arecibo in my back garden)? In case it matters, I live in a rural area, ~5 miles from the nearest town. I originally emailed Jodrell Bank this question but they ignored me :P 

Just a quick question relating to the thermal Blackbody temperature of a celestial object. In the c.g.s regime of astrophysics, is it more 'sophisticated' to quote the thermal Blackbody temperature in units of Kelvin ($\mathrm{K}$) or in units of $\mathrm{keV}$? That is to say to use $k_{B}T_{\mathrm{bb}}$ and convert to an energy? 

Just more of a conceptual question on the mutual inclusivity of the cosmological principle. That is to say, I was wondering if it were possible to have a Universe that were isotropic but NOT homogeneous OR a Universe that were homogeneous but NOT isotropic. My spidey sense is telling me that it is possible that a Universe could be istropic but not homoegenous. Surely, by default, if a Universe is homogenous then it follows that it has to be isotropic? 

One of the caveats to this question is that often one object, say a star, will have multiple names or "designations"" for example, one of the most famous stars I can think of (and, as it happens, one of my favourite) is Vega. Vega is also known as $\alpha$-Lyrae, being the brightest star in the constellation of Lyra. This is known as a Bayer designation: whereby the most of the brighter stars were assigned their first systematic names such as alpha ($\alpha$), beta ($\beta$), gamma ($\gamma$), etc. in order of brightness. The Vega name is the Latin name of the star’s parent constellation in genitive (possessive) form. The entirity of Vega's other designations and names are: Wega, Lucida Lyrae, Alpha Lyrae, α Lyrae, 3 Lyr, GJ 721, HR 7001, BD +38°3238, HD 172167, GCTP 4293.00, LTT 15486, SAO 67174, HIP 91262, 织女一. So you can see, there is really multiple names for one object on the sky, depending on which catalogue you use!
