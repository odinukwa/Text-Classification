When defining the $A_\infty$ algebra of a Lagrangian (as done in the book by FOOO) it is done by "counting" (integrating over the moduli space or over the fiber of evaluation map) pseudoholomorphic discs with incidence conditions. To acheive a virtual fundemental class, a Kuranishi structure is built on these moduli spaces and then a virtual class is obtained by a (multi) section perturbation. I understand that each Kuranishi chart corresponds do the picture of the del-bar operator as a section in the corresponding banach bundle. But now (multi)section perturbations don't necessarily correspond to perturbing J or adding a Hamiltonian term. So in concrete terms what actually happens? It seems to me that after the perturbation what I am counting are no longer solutions to the $\bar\partial_J$ but something else. Can the equation they satisfy be described in some concrete way? Which propeties of J-holomorphic curves these solutions still satisfy? Thanks 

For a topological space M, It is known from homotopy theory that the elements of the first cohomology $H^1(M;\mathbb{Z})$ are in 1-1 correspondence with homotopy classes of maps $[M,S^1]$ In my case of interest M is a smooth manifold. Take $\alpha$ and take smooth $f\colon M \to S^1$ representing $\alpha$ under the above identification. My question is, under what (sufficient / necessary / equiv) conditions $f$ gives a locally trivial fibration (Fiber bundle) of M over $S^1$? I would prefer conditions in terms of homology / cohomology of M. What comes to my mind is that, according to Ehrshmann theorem, since $S^1$ is compact,this map is a fibration iff surjective + submersion. Surjectivity can be assured by picking nontrivial cohomology class. As for submersion. I have no idea how to characterize. Thanks 

$\mathbb Z$ acts on the lattice $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ by adding an element to itself n times. I am studying some function arising from symplectic geometry which happens in my case to be naturally defined on $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ and is constant on each orbit of the $\mathbb Z$-action, thus it lives ob the orbit space. I am curious what kinds of algebraic/geometric/arithmetic structures does this set or orbits has, to compare with the behaviour of my function. Thanks 

I agree strongly with Peter in the comments: if you're interested in $p \gg \frac{\log n}{n}$, then don't do any hard work, just show the answer is essentially $p$ since the graph is essentially always connected. In particular, let $E$ be the event that the edge exists and $C$ the event that the graph is connected. By the law of total probability, \begin{align*} P(E|C)P(C) + P(E,\lnot C) &= p \end{align*} so \begin{align*} P(E|C) &= \frac{p - P(E,\lnot C)}{P(C)} \\ &\leq \frac{p}{1-o(1)} \end{align*} where a lot is known about bounds on the $o(1)$ (the probability the graph is disconnected). (By the way, naturally, we immediately have $P(E|C) \geq p$. To prove it, $P(E|C) = p P(C|E)/P(C)$, and $P(C|E) \geq P(C)$ as guaranteed existence of $(x,y)$ can only raise the chance of connectedness.) 

Topologically sort the graph into layers: Let $L_0$ be all vertices with in-degree $0$, and for $j \geq 1$, let $L_j$ be all vertices that are not in $L_0,\dots,L_{j-1}$ and have an in-edge from some vertex in $L_{j-1}$. Find a maximal matching between $L_0$ and $L_1$. Find a maximal matching between [the remaining vertices of $L_1$] and $L_2$. Repeat for each sequential pair of layers $j,j+1$. 

Edit: I think we can come up with some better "simplicity" condition having to do with a simple set of rules for each piece, but formalizing it seems tricky to me. Of course castling, en passant, and 3-repetition-draw don't satisfy this (edit: nor does e.g. a pin of a piece to the king), so it technically rules out chess. But I think these restrictions make it easier to think about your question. From here we could say that a board game tree always has each node labeled by the board "position" (set of current pieces and their locations) and history of moves. At each node, its moves are labeled by pairs (piece, location) consisting of pieces that can legally be moved (including those that may be newly placed on the board, as in Go) along with a legal destination location. Furthermore if we have the consistency and simplicity conditions, then these do not depend on the history, only the board position, and can be calculated "simply" from that position for each piece. 

For every $m\in\mathbb{N}_+$, $k=0,\dots,m-1$, denote $I_{m,k}:=(\frac{k}{m},\frac{k+1}{m})$. Denote $W = H^1(S^1,\mathbb R^{2n})$ = The Hilbert space of $C^1$ maps maps $v(t)$ from the circle to $\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v$ and $\dot v$ in $L^2$. We will think of those maps as maps $v\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v(0)=v(1)$. Consider the spaces: \begin{eqnarray*} W_m &:=& W\cap\{v\in H^1([0,1],\mathbb R^{2n}):\text{$v|_{I_{m,k}}$ is linear}\} \end{eqnarray*} Consider the projection $P$ from $W$ to $W_m$. Does $P$ have a kernel in the sense of convolution operator or Hilbert-Schmidt operator? Is there a closed formula? (This is reminiscent of the situation in Fourier series, where the projection onto the space of truncated Fourier sums is a convolution with Dirichlet Kernel) Thanks 

For an $A_\infty$-category $\mathcal A$, one defines the group $K_0(\mathcal A)$ by $$K_0(\mathcal A) := \mathbb Z \operatorname{Ob} \operatorname{Tw} \mathcal A / \left<[A]+[B]-[C]\right>$$ Where 1) $Tw$ is the twisted complexes category (a way of formally adding all cones, see, $URL$ section 3.2 for an exposition by Auroux.) 2) The relations are $[A]+[B]-[C]=0$ when $C$ is quasi-isomorphic to a cone of a closed degree 1 morphism $A\to B$ Can one somehow relate $K_0(\mathcal A)$ to $K_0(Fun_{A_\infty}(\mathcal A, \mathcal A))$, i.e. the $K_0$ of the $A_\infty$-category of $A_\infty$-endofunctors? Thanks 

Given an n-dimensional polytope $P$ in $\mathbb R^n$, Given as a convex hull of a finite set of points, $S$ I would like to construct an expliict formula for a function $f\colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that $P=\left\{x\in\mathbb R^n \Big|\ f(x) \le 1\right\}$ Is there any nice known closed formula? It seems that there should be one in existance, as everything is piecewise linear. Moreover, I would like to ask the same question in the case P is given as intersections of half planes (hence, the data I have are normal vectors to the plane and distance from the origin) Thanks 

I will present my question in the specifics I encountered it, so maybe some of the details are irrelevant for the desired conclusion. Consider $(S^2\times S^2,\omega_{std})$ the product of two spheres with standard product symplectic structure. $L\subset M$ is a Lagrangian torus in M. Given a family $\omega_s$ of forms, such that $\omega_0=\omega_{std}$ Choose $J_s$ an almost complex structure compatible with $\omega_s$. (which we are allowed to choose generically). Let $u_s$ be a family of Maslov 2 discs with boundary on $L$, converging to some bubbled curve $v$. Is there something I can say about the shape of the limit curve? The best case scenario would be a statement "If $J_s$ is generic, then the limit consists of two discs, one of Maslov 2 and the other of Maslov 0" I think I can rule out sphere bubbles by area considerations (A sphere in $S^2\times S^2$ has more area than the original disc), But as for discs I don't know how this works. Can I get in the limit discs with negative Maslov? Discs with Maslov $\ge 4$? a lot of Maslov 0 discs? Thank you very much 

Extended comment. The primary challenge in the question is how one models the voters, which relates directly to what types of inputs they can provide and how one evaluates the solution. Your question seems to presume some nice answer to these questions, but in fact I think these are very thorny. To begin, suppose that voters have a well-defined preference ordering on outcomes, but nothing further about their utilities or preferences is assumed. Then it seems tricky to say what the "best" outcome of an election should be in general, and the axiomatic approach was developed to deal with this. OK, so now we want to allow the voters a more expressive system in hopes of avoiding Arrow's or Gibbard-Satterthwaite; but suppose we keep the above modeling assumption on the voters. Then how would one expect voters to behave under, for instance, range voting? (Each voter gives each candidate a score between, say, 1 and 100.) There doesn't seem to be a correct answer as to how a voter with a given preference relation ought to vote in a range voting system. So to allow more expressive voting systems, it seems that we should allow more expressive voter models. Furthermore, our notion of "good" outcomes should make sense for these models, just as the axiomatic approach corresponded to the preference relation model. For instance, perhaps we assume that each voter has a utility associated with each candidate. For simplicity, consider direct-revelation voting rules (just report your utilities). This model runs into immediate problems: Shouldn't "best" be "maximizes sum of utilities"? In this case, we cannot hope to avoid manipulation (a voter wishes to exaggerate the worth of her favorite candidate unboundedly). Perhaps instead best should be "maximizes product of utilities", but again avoiding manipulation seems impossible (a voter would set utility to zero for all but her favorite candidate). One can attempt to fix these issues by, for instance, re-scaling voter utilities so that they all lie in [0,1] with the favorite candidate having a utility of 1 and least favorite candidate having a utility of 0. Then we might evaluate a rule by how well it maximizes the sum of utilities or so on. However, this seems to make a mockery of the original utility model -- perhaps we really do have one voter with much higher utility for one candidate than everyone else, so how can we say that any voting rule that ignores this fact is "good"? Perhaps the right notion is fairness (in some sense) rather than total utility, but again, this needs to be defined mathematically. So, I'm not sure if there is research that tackles these issues, but I know that we have to solve the question of how to model voters and evaluate outcomes in order to proceed in addressing your question, and this is nontrivial.
