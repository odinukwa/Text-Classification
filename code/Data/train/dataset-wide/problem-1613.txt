All possible tests of the Arp model have been failed. High redshift quasars have Lyman alpha forests, low redshift galaxies do not. The Arp model suggests that the Lyman alpha forests are somehow intrinsic to the quasar. There are many problems with this idea. 

The chemical elements in our bodies are inherited from the Earth. The Earth was formed in a disc of gas and dust swirling around the protosun 4.5 billion years ago. The material that formed the Earth was a selection of the material from that protostellar nebula that was itself once part of a larger molecular cloud. So the atoms in our body were once part of this molecular cloud, so we need to understand how they got there. After the first ten minutes or so, the universe contained mainly hydrogen, helium and some traces of lithium, deuterium and tritium - and that's all. No oxygen, iron, carbon etc. Almost all of the heavier chemical elements are made inside stars. We could stop there - the atoms of carbon, oxygen, calcium etc. in our bodies must have been made in stars, and since these atoms/nuclei are stable, they must survive unchanged (you could argue about whether their electrons get swapped about in chemical reactions etc., but since electrons are indistinguishable this hardly matters). But how do they get into a molecular cloud and what sort of stars make these elements? A couple of answers correctly identify massive stars that explode as supernovae as important. But they are by no means the only contributor, or even the most important contributor for some elements. If we take carbon and nitrogen, these are manufactured in nuclear reactions inside stars of even a bit less than a solar mass during the horizontal branch and asymptotic giant branch stages. These stars may be less massive and produce less C and N than massive stars, but there are many more of them. The central material is mixed to the surface during thermal pulses and the outer envelope, enriched in a variety of chemical elements, is gradually lost into space via a slow wind. This is a major source of carbon, nitrogen, fluorine, lithium and a number of heavy elements - Ba, La, Zr, Sr, Pb and many others - produced in the s-process. About 50% of the elements heavier than iron are made in the s-process, which can occur in both massive stars that explode (mainly isotopes with $A<90$) and the less massive AGB stars with slow, massive winds (elements up to lead and bismuth). Iron, nickel and many other elements such as sulphur and silicon are also produced during type Ia supernovae. This is the detonation of a white dwarf, the end stage of a low-mass star, after mass transfer or merger. Milder novae explosions caused by the ignition of material accreted onto a white dwarf also enrich the interstellar medium. All these different processes produce distinctive patterns of element abundances. The enriched material is swept up by neighbouring supernova explosions, by interactions with spiral arms and other molecular clouds. It cools, condenses and collapses to form a new generation of stars. Analysis of "presolar grains" found inside meteorites tells us what our solar system formed from. These analyses tell us that all of the above processes were important in making the chemical elements that made up the Earth and hence those in our bodies. [Further details on the production of elements heavier than iron (including supernovae, low-mass AGB stars, colliding neutron stars etc.) can be found in my Physics SE answer to this question. ] 

A comprehensive treatment of what happens to solar systems when the central star loses mass in a time-dependent way is given in Adams et al. (2013). The simplest cases are initially circular orbits where the mass loss takes place on much longer timescales than the orbital period. As mass loss proceeds, the gravitational potential energy increases (becomes less negative) and thus the total orbital energy increases and the orbit gets wider. Roughly speaking, $aM$ is a constant, where $a$ is the orbital radius: so the Earth would end up in a 2 au orbit. However, in the presence of a non-zero eccentricity in the initial orbit, or in the case of rapid mass loss, such as that which occurs towards the end of the AGB phase, then things become altogether more unpredictable, with the eccentricity also growing as mass loss proceeds. This has a knock-on effect when considering the dynamical stability of the whole (evolved) solar system and may result in planetary ejection. The faster the mass loss, the more unpredictable things get. The radius of an AGB star can be calculated using $ L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T_{eff}^{4}$. Stars at the tip of the AGB branch have luminosities of $\sim 10^{4} L_{\odot}$ and $T_{eff} \simeq 2500\ K$, leading to likely radii of $\sim 2$ au. So it is quite likely that unless the Earth is ejected or has its orbit significantly modified by some dynamical instability that, like the inner planets, it will end up engulfed in the outer enevelope of the AGB star and spiral inwards... 

No complete answer from me, but some obvious examples of "hair" on a neutron star are: The temperature - both internal and surface temperature can be measured (in principle). These are mainly a function of the age of the neutron star. The magnetic field - young neutron stars have very strong magnetic fields that are probably an inherited property from the composition and rotation of the progenitor. The field decays with time. The surface composition may vary from neutron star to neutron star. In principle this can be measured with X-ray spectroscopy. The composition may be connected with the progenitor, but could also reflect accreted material. Neutron stars have a radius! The radius may or may not be a unique function of mass. It could depend on the rotation, composition and age. I think though, the gist of your question is could one determine the progenitor of a neutron star from observations of the neutron star? At present the answer to that is no. Even the relationship between neutron star mass and progenitor mass is not understood; it is also unclear why some neutron stars have very high magnetic fields and so on. But ultimately that would be an aim. 

Aside from being, I suspect, totally incompatible with GR, the model fails to match observations. The universe appears to be homogeneous and isotropic. In the model you suggest, Hubble's law would be different depending on which direction you were looking. In particular, looking away from the black hole, galaxy redshifts would increase to some asymptotic value, whereas looking towards the black hole they would increase to infinity. If the argument is that the central black hole is so far away that we cannot measure this asymmetry (i.e. well beyond the observable universe, given the homogeneity of the cosmic microwave background - but then does the model have an explanation for the CMB at all?), then the model also needs to explain why galaxies would move in this particular way, since they would not "feel" the influence of the black hole. 

I don't think there is necessarily a problem with it being dry or cold. An excellent similacrum of the Martian surface conditions is found in Antarctica. There are plenty of anaerobic microbes that exist here. A brief search reveals Shivaji (1988); Franzmann & Rhode (1992); Dube et al. (2001). To quote the wikipedia entry on the "McMurdo dry valleys" - "Endolithic photosynthetic bacteria have been found living in the Dry Valleys, sheltered from the dry air in the relatively moist interior of rocks. Summer meltwater from the glaciers provides the primary source of soil nutrients. Scientists consider the Dry Valleys perhaps the closest of any terrestrial environment to the planet Mars, and thus an important source of insights into possible extraterrestrial life." I think that's quite direct. 

You can find a neat description and some examples of the effect here. This is known as the pulsar dispersion measure. As you correctly say, waves with longer wavelength (lower energy photons) are delayed with respect to shorter wavelength radiation from the same phenomenon. When electromagnetic waves travel through a plasma, they excite currents in the free charged particles. In such cases it can be shown (using Maxwell's equations) that the waves propagate with a relationship between their frequency $\omega$ and "wavenumber" $k = 2\pi/\lambda$ given by $$\omega^2 = \omega_p^{2} + c^2k^2,$$ where $\omega_p$ is known as the "plasma" frequency and equals $(4\pi n_e e^2/m_e)^{1/2}$ for the electrons in the plasma (i.e. it depends on the electron number density $n_e$.). Now, if you have a bunch of photons emitted as a pulse, the relevant velocity is the group velocity given by $v_g=d\omega/dk$. So $$v_g = \frac{c^2 k}{(\omega_p^{2} +c^2 k^2)^{1/2}} = c\left(1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\right)^{1/2}$$ This converges to $c$ when the frequencies are high (wavelengths are short), but is slower when frequencies are low (wavelengths are long). In terms of an intuitive physical picture, yes you could think that the refractive index is frequency dependent, but the difference here is that the reason for this dispersion is that waves travelling through a conductive medium are "lossy" - that is the currents induced also encounter resistivity and therefore the waves heat the plasma. 

Supernovae probably occur about once per century in our own (quite large) galaxy. If we were to assume similar star formation rates and a similar stellar birth-mass distribution in other galaxies and that the galaxies in the HST-UDF were similar to our own, then we could also assume that the supernova rate was similar. The UDF was taken over about 4 months, or 1/300 of a century. So one might expect a supernova to occur in about 1/300 galaxies - so about 300 of the 10,000 galaxies observed will have hosted a supernova during the period that the image was built up. Of course, even if this figure is correct (see below), many of these may have been missed because the galaxies were too far away or the supernovae were obscured by dust, or because they brightened and faded between observations (there was a 6 week gap in the observations). On the other hand, the UDF was imaged later by HST with other instruments, leading to further opportunities to identify supernova candidates. The calculated number could be awry in many ways. Most galaxies are smaller than the Milky Way, so one might expect fewer supernovae. On the other hand, most of these galaxies are far away and the star formation rate was likely higher in the past, leading to more supernovae. On the other hand, the supernova rate will be higher in some types of galaxies (Starbursts), but lower in others (ellipticals). Without a very detailed demography of the types, metallicity, masses and ages of the galaxies, and a detailed understanding of how the supernova rate varies with these parameters, your question is difficult to answer.
