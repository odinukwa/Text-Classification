If $H$ is a homotopy from $f$ to $g$, with $f$ and $g$ invertible, then $f^{-1} H g^{-1}$ is a homotopy from $g^{-1}$ to $f^{-1}$. 

(1) As stated, the answer to the question is "no". Let $A = \Delta[1] \cup_{\partial\Delta[1]} \Delta[1]$ be the union of two copies of $\Delta[1]$ along their common boundary, let $g \colon A \to \Delta[1]$ be the identity on each copy of $\Delta[1]$, and let $f = Ex^\infty g$ map $X = Ex^\infty A$ to $Y = Ex^\infty \Delta[1]$. Here $Ex^\infty = colim_n Ex^n$ is Kan's functor, with $Ex^n$ right adjoint to $Sd^n$. Then $f$ is (split) surjective, $X$ and $Y$ are Kan complexes, and $X_0 = A_0$ maps identically to $Y_0 = \Delta[1]_0$. Hence your hypotheses are satisfied. However, $H^1(Y) = 0$ is not isomorphic to $H^1(X) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. (2) You might strengthen the hypothesis to assume that the preimage of each simplex of $Y$ is weakly contractible, i.e., that for each (non-degenerate) simplex $y \in Y_n$ with representing map $\bar y \colon \Delta[n] \to Y$ the fibre product $\Delta[n] \times_Y X$ is weakly contractible (or has trivial cohomology). No Kan condition is then needed to inductively prove that $f^{-1}(Z) \to Z$ is a cohomology equivalence for each subcomplex $Z \subseteq Y$. It does not, however, follow that $f \colon X \to Y$ is a homotopy equivalence. (3) If you want to conclude that $f \colon X \to Y$ is a homotopy equivalence, you can assume that each point inverse $|f|^{-1}(y)$, of the topological realization $|f| \colon |X| \to |Y|$, is contractible. Here $y$ ranges over $|Y|$. For finite simplicial sets $X$ and $Y$ this implies that $f$ is a simple-homotopy equivalence. See e.g. Proposition 2.1.8 in my book with Waldhausen and Jahren. 

Quillen's $Q$-construction naturally arises as a cleaned-up version of Segal's edgewise subdivision of Waldhausen's $s_\bullet$-construction. Waldhausen's $s_\bullet$-construction gives a rather natural definition of the algebraic $K$-theory space of an exact category $C$. It is a simplicial set $s_\bullet C$, whose elements in degree $q\ge0$ are ``length $q$ filtrations'' $0 \rightarrowtail M_1 \rightarrowtail \dots \rightarrowtail M_q$ in $C$, plus some choices. The algebraic $K$-theory space $K(C)$ is defined as the loop space $\Omega |s_\bullet C|$ of the geometric realization of this simplicial set. My understanding is that Quillen knew of this construction, but was unhappy with the passage from categories to simplicial sets. At some point he realized that even if $s_\bullet C$ is not the nerve of a category, its Segal subdivision $Sd(s_\bullet C)$ is (basically) the nerve of a category. That category is the $Q$-construction, $Q(C)$. Since Segal subdivision does not change the homotopy type, the loop space $\Omega |Q(C)|$ of the classifying space of $Q(C)$ is as good a definition for $K(C)$ as the one I first stated. Some people would write $BQ(C)$ where I write $|Q(C)|$. See Section 1.9 of 

The convenient category CGH of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces has some poor colimits, since Hausdorffification may change the underlying point sets. The category CGWH of compactly generated weak Hausdorff spaces is even better behaved. The advantages are discussed in Chris McCord's paper "Classifying Spaces and Infinite Symmetric Products", Trans. A.M.S. (1969), which credits John Moore for these ideas. Lewis-May-Steinberger and Elmendorf-Kriz-Mandell-May do their serious work on spectra and S-modules in CGWH. This is probably the category of topological spaces (as opposed to simplicial sets) in which most algebraic topologists really work. A search for "CGWH" leads to several related questions on this site, including a link to Neil Strickland's note $URL$ . (I think his reference to Jim McClure's thesis might really be to Gaunce Lewis' thesis.) 

The NDR-condition asks that the inclusion of $e$ in $G$ is a cofibration. That is of course weaker than asking for $G$ to be a CW-space, but not as general as how the question was posed. Since $EG$ is contractible, the long exact sequence in homotopy for a quasi-fibration, at the usual base point of $BG$, gives a bijection $$ \partial : \pi_1(BG) \cong \pi_0(G) $$ of $\pi_1(BG)$-sets. This at least gives you an isomorphism between $\pi_1(BG)$ and some group structure on $\pi_0(G)$. 

By May's Remark 2.6, the answer should be no. If $X$ is a Moore space with $\tilde H_*(X; Z) = Z/p$ concentrated in an odd degree $2q-1$, and $\tilde H_*(X; Z/p) = Z/p\{x, y\}$ with $\beta_1(y) = x$, then in $H_*(Q(X); Z/p)$ the $r$-th Bockstein $\beta_r$ is defined and nonzero on $y^{p^{r-1}}$ for each $r\ge1$, so $H_*(Q(X); Z)$ contains a copy of $Z/p^r$ in degree $2p^{r-1}q-1$. Hence there is no uniform power of $p$ that annihilates all the $p$-torsion. 

A possibly interesting analogue of the formula $HF_{2*} HF_2 = \otimes_{i\ge1} F_2[\xi_i]$ is $HZ_{(2)*} HZ_{(2)} = \otimes^L_{i\ge1} Z_{(2)*}[\xi_i^2]/(2\xi_i^2)$, where $\otimes^L$ means the derived tensor product. In other words, resolve $Z_{(2)*}[\xi_i^2]/(2\xi_i^2)$ by (flat or) free $Z_{(2)}$-modules, tensor the resolutions together, and pass to homology. If I recall correctly, the "first" interesting class $\xi_2^3 + \xi_1^2 \xi_3$ (in degree 9) arises as a torsion product of $\xi_1^2$ and $\xi_2^2$. I needed this for a Shukla homology calculation once. Presumably there is also an odd story. 

Just as $ku$ is quite close to $H\mathbb Z$ in the sequence $S \to ku \to H\mathbb Z$ of commutative ring spectra, and $KU$ is quite close to $H\mathbb Q$, the classifying space $BGL(ku)$ for $2$-vector bundles is quite close to $BGL(\mathbb Z)$ in the sequence $BGL(S) \to BGL(ku) \to BGL(\mathbb Z)$. Here $GL = GL_\infty$. I do not know how to get closer to $H\mathbb R$ and $BGL(\mathbb R) \simeq BO$, or $H\mathbb C$ and $BGL(\mathbb C) \simeq BU$, but you could apply Quillen's plus construction and look at $A(*) = K(S) \to K(ku) \to K(\mathbb Z)$. Even closer to $H\mathbb Z$ is the second Postnikov section $P^2ku$ of $ku$. It is the nerve of a symmetric bimonoidal category $R$ with objects the integers and $R(m, n) = \mathbb C^\times$ for $m=n$, $\emptyset$ for $m \ne n$. I think Thomas Kragh wrote this out in his paper in Math. Scand. (2013). So $P^2 ku$-bundles are quite close to $\mathbb Z$-bundles, as reflected in the map $BGL(P^2 ku) \to BGL(\mathbb Z)$ of classifying spaces. If you prefer to compare with (stable) spherical fibrations, classified by $BF = BGL_1(S)$, the classifying spaces $BGL_1(ku)$ and $BGL_1(P^2 ku)$ are close to $BGL_1(\mathbb Z)$. Note that $BSL_1(P^2 ku) = K(\mathbb Z, 3)$ is the classifying space for gerbes with band $U(1)$. So an early "non-linearity" to consider is that of gerbes. 

Let $X$ be a simplicial set. The partially ordered set $(X^{nd}, \leq)$ of non-degenerate simplices of $X$, with $x\le y$ if $x$ is a face of $y$, was considered by Barratt in a 1956 Princeton preprint. I write $B(X) = N(X^{nd}, \le)$ for its nerve, the Barratt nerve. It is not quite clear to me if, in your definition of $Face \colon sSet \to Pos$, you only allow the non-degenerate simplices as elements. Let me assume that you make that restriction, so that $Nerve \circ Face(X) = B(X)$. If $X$ is the simplicial set associated to an (ordered) simplicial complex, then $B(X)$ is indeed the barycentric subdivision of that simplicial complex. In these cases, there is a homeomorphism $|B(X)| \cong |X|$. However, if $X = \Delta^n/\partial\Delta^n$ for $n\ge1$, then $X^{nd}$ is isomorphic to $[1] = (0 < 1)$ and its nerve is contractible. So in these cases $|B(X)|$ is not homeomorphic (nor homotopy equivalent) to $|X|$. From the definition of Kan's normal subdivision $Sd(X)$ as a coend, there is a canonical natural map $b_X \colon Sd(X) \to B(X)$. It is an isomorphism if and only if $X$ is non-singular, meaning that the representing map $\bar x \colon \Delta^n \to X$ of each non-degenerate simplex of $X$ is a cofibration. Here $n$ is the dimension of $x$. There exists a homeomorphism $h_X \colon |Sd(X)| \cong |X|$, due to Fritsch and Puppe (1967). However, it is not natural for most maps $X \to Y$ of simplicial sets. For instance, there is no way to fix $h_{\Delta^1}$ and $h_{\Delta^2}$ so that the homeomorphisms are compatible with both of the degeneracy maps $\sigma^j \colon \Delta^2 \to \Delta^1$. The normal subdivision $Sd(X)$ of any simplicial set is a regular simplicial set, in the sense that each representing map $\bar x \colon \Delta^n \to X$ only makes identifications along the last ($n$th) face. The geometric realization of a regular simplicial set is a regular CW complex, i.e., if the closure of each $n$-cell is an $n$-ball and the boundary of the open $n$-cell in its closure is an $(n-1)$-sphere. Any regular CW complex admits a triangulation. See e.g. Fritsch and Piccinini (1990), sections 3.4 and 4.6 for proofs. Combining the two previous paragraphs, the realization of any simplicial set can be triangulated by a simplicial complex, but not in a natural way. Not every CW complex can be triangulated (Metzler, 1967), but the realizations of (regular) simplicial sets can. In work of Waldhausen, Jahren and myself (Spaces of PL Manifolds and Categories of Simple Maps, Annals of Maths. Studies, to appear in 2013) we consider finite simplicial sets $X$ and prove in Proposition 2.5.8 that there are natural maps $$ Sd(Sd(X)) \to B(Sd(X)) \to Sd(X) \to X . $$ Each of these are simple, in the sense that their geometric realizations have contractible point inverses. In particular, they are simple-homotopy equivalences. The term $B(Sd(X))$ is the nerve of a partially ordered set, hence an ordered simplicial complex. So there is, indeed, a natural simple map $$ i_X \colon B(Sd(X)) \to X $$ from an ordered simplicial complex to $X$. You mentioned geometric topology at the outset. If $X$ is a combinatorial manifold, so that $M = |B(Sd(X))|$ and $N = |X|$ are PL manifolds, then Cohen (1970) proved that any simple PL map $M \to N$ can be uniformly approximated by a PL homeomorphism (assuming the manifolds are of dimension at least 5). Hence the natural map $|i_X| \colon |B(Sd(X))| \to |X|$ is a map from an ordered simplicial complex that is arbitrarily close to a PL homeomorphism, but I have no reason to expect that this approximation can be made natural. 

(1) Given a simplicial monoid $G$ let $R^0(*, G)$ be the Waldhausen category of pointed finite free $G$-simplicial sets weakly equivalent to $(\coprod^k G)_+$, for varying $k\ge0$. This is the special case $n=0$ of the notation from sections 2.1 and 2.2 of Waldhausen's ''Algebraic $K$-theory of spaces''. He obtains a homotopy equivalence $$ |hR^0_k(*, G)| \simeq BH^0_k(G) = B(\Sigma_k \ltimes |G|^k) , $$ so by Segal's theorem $$ \Omega |h N_\bullet R^0(*, G)| \simeq Z \times colim_k |hR^0_k(*, G)|^+ $$ and the Barratt-Priddy-Quillen-Segal theorem $$ Z \times colim_k B(\Sigma_k \ltimes |G|^k)^+ \simeq Q(B|G|_+) $$ you know that the ``direct sum'' $K$-theory $\Omega |h N_\bullet R^0(*, G)|$ of $R^0(*, G)$ is a model for $Q(B|G|)_+)$. I think the natural map $$ |hN_\bullet R^0(*, G)| \to |hS_\bullet R^0(*, G)| $$ is an equivalence, since all cofibrations are split in this case, but I don't have a reference at hand. For a space $X$, let $R^0(X)$ be the Waldhausen category of finite retractive spaces over $X$, homotopy equivalent to $X$ disjoint union finitely many points (or $0$-cells, if you like). If $X \simeq B|G|$, there is a homotopy equivalence $$ |hS_\bullet R^0(X)| \simeq |hS_\bullet R^0(*, G)| , $$ so $R^0(X)$ should do the trick for you, also if $X$ is not connected. (2) For simplicial sets $X \colon [q] \mapsto X_q$ there is a different construction, in an unpublished preprint of Igusa-Waldhausen (my copy is from 1991), of a simplicial Waldhausen category $C_0(X)$ that in degree $q$ is given by a non-obvious Waldhausen category of finite sets over $X_q$. Their Corollary 1.5 is an equivalence $$ \Omega |iS_\bullet C_0(X)| \simeq Q(|X|_+) . $$ 

With the aid of machine computations, you can readily determine the Adams differentials up to $t-s=30$ using the multiplicative structure, the relation between Steenrod operations in $\text{Ext}_A$ and the $E_\infty$ (or $H_\infty$) ring spectrum structure, a comparison with the mapping cone $C_\sigma = S \cup_{\sigma} e^8$ and a comparison with the image-of-$J$ spectrum $j = \text{hofib}(\psi^3-1 : ko \to bspin)$. In this limited range this sidesteps the use of Toda brackets and the solution of the Adams conjecture, which were frequently used by Barratt, Mahowald and Tangora for their calculation in the range $t-s \le 45$. This is not an argument for not learning about those methods and results! Nonetheless, this is how I recently went through the calculation in class: In the range $t-s \le 30$ the Adams $E_2$-term is generated as an algebra by the $h_i$ for $0 \le i \le 4$ in Adams filtration $s=1$, $c_0$ and $c_1$ in filtration $s=3$, $d_0$, $e_0$, $f_0$ and $g = g_1$ in filtration $s=4$, $Ph_1$ and $Ph_2$ with $s=5$, $r$ with $s=6$, $Pc_0$, $i$, $j$ and $k$ with $s=7$, $Pd_0$ and $Pe_0$ with $s=8$, $P^2h_1$ and $P^2h_2$ with $s=9$, $P^2c_0$ with $s=11$, $P^2d_0$ with $s=12$, and $P^3h_1$ and $P^3h_2$ with $s=13$. This can easily be checked with Bruner's ext-program. The notation is derived from Peter May's thesis, as presented in Martin Tangora's 1970 Math. Z. paper. Only $f_0$ is ambiguously defined modulo decomposables. Many differentials can now be determined by the relation between the $E_\infty$ structure on $S$ and the Steenrod operations on $\text{Ext}_A$. This is due to D.S. Kahn, J. Milgram, J. Makinen and R.R. Bruner, in increasing generality. See Bruner's chapter in the $H_\infty$ book of Bruner, May, McClure and Steinberger for further details. The $E_\infty$ structure applied to $\sigma : S^7 \to S$ gives a map $\Sigma^7 RP_7^\infty = D_2(S^7) \to S$ that extends $\sigma^2$, and gives you the relations $2\sigma^2 = 0$ (which forces the differential $d_2(h_4) = h_0h_3^2$) and $\eta\sigma^2 = 0$. The $E_\infty$ structure applied to $2\sigma : S^7 \to S$, together with the Steenrod operations on $\text{Ext}_A$, tells you that $h_1 h_4$ is a permanent cycle. The $E_\infty$ structure applied to $\eta\sigma : S^8 \to S$ tells you that $h_2 h_4$ is a permanent cycle, if you accept a Cartan formula for power operations. This deduction can be replaced by the arguments below. The $E_\infty$ structure applied to $\epsilon : S^8 \to S$ gives the differential $d_2(f_0) = h_0^2 e_0$, and tells you that $c_1$ is a permanent cycle. This relies on the algebraic facts that $Sq^2(c_0) = h_0 e_0$, $Sq^1(c_0) = f_0$ and $Sq^0(c_0) = c_1$. (Bruner's original paper uses a different indexing system for the $Sq^i$ than I use here.) Using $h_0$- and $h_1$-linearity of $d_2$, you can deduce $d_2(h_0 f_0) = h_0^3 e_0$ and $d_2(e_0) = h_1^2 d_0$. Multiplying by $d_0$, you get $d_2(d_0f_0) = h_0^2 d_0 e_0$, and using $h_2$-, $h_0$- and $h_1$-linearity of $d_2$ you find $d_2(k) = h_0 d_0^2$, $d_2(j) = h_0 Pe_0$, $d_2(Pe_0) = h_1^2 i$ and $d_2(i) = h_0 Pd_0$. Many more $d_2$-differentials for higher $t-s$ follow in this way. Together with the Adams differential $d_2(h_5) = h_0 h_4^2$, these are the only $d_2$'s affecting $t-s \le 30$. This is clear from the multiplicative structure (and the fact that $d_2 \circ d_2 = 0$). To get at the $d_3$-differentials, you can use naturality along $i : S \to C_\sigma$. There is a class $\beta$ in bidegree $(t-s,s) = (15,3)$ of the $E_2$-term of the Adams spectral sequence for $C_\sigma$, such that $h_2 \beta = i_*(f_0)$. (This notation is compatible with the $tmf$-notation used by A. Henriques and T. Bauer.) By naturality $d_2(i_*(f_0)) = h_0^2 i_*(e_0)$, and by $h_2$-linearity $d_2(\beta) = h_0 i_*(d_0)$ in the Adams spectral sequence for $C_\sigma$. Thus $d_2(h_0 \beta) = h_0^2 i_*(d_0)$. It follows that $\pi_{14}(C_\sigma)$ (implicitly $2$-completed) has order dividing $2^2=4$. Looking at the long exact sequence $$ \pi_7(S) \overset{\sigma}\longrightarrow \pi_{14}(S) \to \pi_{14}(C_\sigma) \to \pi_6(S) \to \pi_{13}(S) $$ you can deduce that $\pi_{14}(S)$ has order exactly $4$, so that $d_0$ and $h_3^2$ survive to $E_\infty$ and detect $\kappa$ and $\sigma^2$, respectively. This also implies that $h_0 d_0$ must be a boundary, and $d_3(h_0 h_4) = h_0 d_0$ is the only possibility, which implies $d_3(h_0^2 h_4) = h_0^2 d_0$. You can also deduce that $i_*(h_4)$ is a permanent cycle for $C_\sigma$, and this implies that $d_3(h_2h_4) = 0$ for $S$. The final $d_3$-differential in this range, $d_3(r) = h_1 d_0^2$, can be obtained from the $E_\infty$ structure applied to $\kappa : S^{14} \to S$, using $Sq^2(d_0) = r$. The next possible $d_3$-differentials start in $t-s=31$. The only possibly nonzero $d_4$-differential is that on $h_4 c_0$, which might hit $Pd_0$, but $h_1 h_4 c_0$ is a permanent cycle and $h_1 Pd_0$ is nonzero, so this is excluded by $h_1$-linearity of $d_4$. The only possibly nonzero later differentials are those on $h_2 h_4$ and $g$, which might conceivably hit $h_1 Pc_0$ or an $h_0$-power times $Ph_2$, respectively. To eliminate this possibility, one can use naturality with respect to the map $e : S \to j$. The cohomology of $j$ is the unique nonsplit extension of the $A$-modules given by the cokernel and desuspended kernel of $$ (\psi^3-1)^* : \Sigma^4 A/A\{Sq^1, Sq^2Sq^3\} = H^*(bspin) \to H^*(ko) = A/A\{Sq^1, Sq^2\} \,, $$ sending the generator $\Sigma^4 1$ to $Sq^4$. Its Adams $E_2$-term can be calculated in this range by Bruner's programs, and in the range $t-s \le 24$ it is easy to see that the only differential pattern that is compatible with the known abutment, i.e., $\pi_*(j)$ completed at $2$, is one with $E_3 = E_\infty$. The map of $E_3$-terms induced by $e : S \to j$ is surjective for $t-s \le 24$, except for $t-s=15$ (the homomorphism $\pi_{15}(e)$ involves a shift of Adams filtration). In particular, the imagined targets for differentials on $h_2 h_4$ and $g$ in the Adams spectral sequence for $S$ map to survivors in the Adams spectral sequence for $j$, hence cannot be hit by differentials for $S$, after all.
