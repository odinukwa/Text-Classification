The real exchange rate is an index. For example, the nominal exchange rate between British pounds and US dollars is 0.75 pounds per dollar (as of today; e.g. £20 are roughly $27). To calculate the real exchange rate, you have to multiply this by the relative prices of these two countries, after which you end up with a dimensionless index. This index tells you the relative value of the same basket of goods in the two countries. In a very idealised world were the law of one price holds, such index is one. Both the bilateral exchange rate and the effective or multilateral exchange rate are defined in terms of currencies. Not their real counterparts. 

Naturally, the net contribution is what matters for analysis the case of "EU budget without UK". However, as both report point out, the UK receives other contribution, which come from an "allocation of funds via competition". Think of the EU having a fund for, say, improvement in infrastructure. Countries apply to this fund, and some countries get it. Well, as the first report says, the UK got £1bn extra through that mechanism in the 2015/16 year. Should this be counted as part of the exercise? Probably not, because those extra funds would have been allocated to another country anyway. So, given that the total budget of the EU in 2015 was €141,280 million, and taking an average EUR/GBP of 0.73, the percentage of contribution of UK to EU budget in 2015 was: $$ \frac{8,473}{141,280 \times 0.73} = 8.2\% $$ Regarding 2017, table in page 11 shows only the gross payments, including the rebate, but not the public rector receipts. As such, the effective contribution of the UK is not going to be 12.5% as the document notes, but lower. Given historical levels of receipts, you could estimate that the contribution of the UK to the EU budget would be perhaps around 9%. In any case, as far as I know, this cannot be known ex-ante, reason why it is not included in the official budget document. Part B: how would the EU budget change after Brexit Since this relates to a future event, it is impossible to tell. This is for several reasons: 

First, let us make a distinction between the functional distribution of income, related to how payment goes to factors of production, i.e, labour and capital, via wages and rents, and the personal distribution of income, which refers to how such factor payments are distributed across individuals or households. After commenting about this, we can start to talk about wealth inequality. If we assume your two unsupported claims are true (namely (i) workers pay increase linearly, and (ii) profits increase exponentially), it would be true that the functional distribution of income would shift in favor of capital. This is, the labour share would fall exponentially to zero. This however has several problems. First, bargaining by workers (e.g. through unions) would induce them to demand higher wages. Second, if captialists are getting a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital, there is incentive to create more companies. You can imagine many workers turning into entrepreneurs, reducing the supply of labour and thereby leading to higher wages; competition would also increase, reducing (even if not eliminating) "abnormal" profits. Third, such result is historically untrue. The labour share has remained either constant or fallen slowly, but by no means has decreased exponentially. It remains at a 50-60% level or so, depending on the country and definition: 

Use the World Bank data on US inflation to deflate the UN Comtrade dataset, so that it is also in constant prices. Select Download, at the right side of the page, and you can get the dataset in csv or other formats. To deflate the trade data, simply divide the values of bilateral trade by the value of each years CPI index, and then multiply them by the value of CPI in 2010 (the base year, which is 100 in this case). Alternatively, rebase the CPI index, by dividing all values by 100, so that CPI in 2010 is equal to 1. Then, divide the trade data by this new index. Both approaches are equivalent. 

(LaTeX/TikZ code of figure for replication here) Mathematically Mathematically, let us consider the case of just two period. First period is $x$ and second is $y$. For simplicity, define the budget constraint as $x+y=1$. If you maximize $U(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ subject to $x+y=1$, the FOC alone will give you $x^∗=y^∗=1/2$ (this is, smooth consumption). However, in this case $U^∗=1/2$, which is smaller than simply setting, say $x^∗=1$ and $y^∗=0$ (which gives $U^∗=1$). What is going on? Here, you can show that the SOC is positive, which is not the case of a maximum, but actually, of a minimum. So actually, the optimisation problem (what this exercise truly is) is that of a minimisation. 

Complexity/Evolutionary Economics This approach to economics, widely inspired in Evolutionary Biology, is a direct criticism to Neoclassical Economics, as its key postulates indicate. These are: 

In a report by the BBC, it emerged that the Bank of England suggested some banks to lower the Libor, around 2008. The Libor is normally set by commercial banks, and it is directly affecting mortgages and lending rates (more info here). As the BBC Radio 4 commentator said this morning, it is the "rate that really matters". However, the news is presented as a breach of authority, as it is not the competence of the BoE to manipulate the Libor. And yet, the BoE wants to affect short term interest rates to affect commercial lending! All this is a bit odd. If this rate is so important, why is it not the Libor the key tool of monetary policy of the Bank of England? Why to bother with an "imperfect" tool like the rate of short term gov. bonds, and not set the Libor, for the whole range of maturities (as banks do), directly? 

Open access articles in non-open access journals are those whose authors (or institutions) are willing to pay a fee to make the article freely available (e.g. see here). Some publishers or site aggregators offer the possibility to search for those articles, e.g. ScienceDirect and Wiley. 

You can find this information here. They provide an overview of their results, together with a link to the data and its description. The data is also available through LIS (second item). Interestingly, this does not only include the US, but also many other OECD countries, in a homogeneous methodology (great for comparisons). Additionally, this is a longitudinal study of each country. In total, they have data for 27 developed countries between 1978 and 2013. The data is very comprehensive, and it is at the decile level. It includes: 

A response from Neo-classical economics: If there are for-profit companies hiring graduates from these faculties, then yes, they do produce value. The sum of their wages is their contribution in terms of value-added to GDP. Same applies to economists. If they are hired by companies, then their production is valuable. I see no particular difference between economists and any other degree, and I do not see why you make such an a-priori distinction, other than an implicit view of economists as superior (widespread in the field, btw). Now, the argument about the value of graduates that is allocated to non-profit organisations, including the state, universities, NGOs, and etc, goes exactly in the same way. Consider Greenpeace. If donors of Greenpeace consider it's activity as valuable, and Greenpeace wants to hire economists and artists, then their production has value, because some people benefit from Greenpeace activities. As such, there is no reason why you would not value the contribution of all these careers. Again, the argument applies to both economists and non-economists. The only situation where you could argue that there is no value produced is when a degree is producing graduates which are then hired to run those same degrees, in a perpetual circle. I am afraid that economics is just as likely to suffer from this than any other discipline. 

I am looking for formal terminology from labor economics, but I can't find it. So far I am using absolute and comparative advantage, but that is not exactly the definition used in international trade theory. References are greatly appreciated. 

That type of demand is called an Isoelastic demand function, because the elasticity of demand is constant, so it does not depend on prices. You have not done any mistake. But you just need to move forward one more step. Notice that at the moment your derivative has both p and q in it. Try to get rid of q. This is, try to have $\epsilon=f(p)$, and not $\epsilon=f(p,q)$. This hint should be enough for you to solve the question. 

I think it is not available. The data is not available in the official American Economic Review website, nor on the personal website of the authors of the replication study (the third author does not have a website). The spreadsheet was given to the authors of the replication paper by Reinhart and Rogoff via email. There might have been an implicit agreement not to disclose it. Apparently, the underlying data cannot be produced directly from the website Reinhart and Rogoff used. The replication paper states: 

In physics there is the concept of arrow of time, which states that time only evolves in one direction (forward), and that this should be visible in the material world. As the Wikipedia article states (emphasis mine): 

Because they are high in comparison. Take a look at the data from the OECD here, for 2015. I have plotted them below: 

to refer to movements from $D$ to $\tilde D$ (using shift is quite more specific than using change, as it more clearly refer to a change in the whole demand schedule). 

Here is the latest report of the Congressional Budget Office on federal taxes by households. The main result you are looking for is this one (page 31): 

It is not necessarily true that lagged $y$ are endogenous. That depends entirely on the structure you assume for $u_t$. If $u_t$ is white noise, there is no endogeneity, in the sense that $$ E(u_t|\mathbf{y}) = 0 $$ where $\mathbf{y}=\{y_{t-1}, \cdots , y_{t-p}\}$. This is trivial to prove, once you realise that the above equality can also be expressed as $$E(u_t y_{t-i})=0 \,\,\quad, i=\{1, \cdots, p\} $$ using the Law of Total Expectations. Conversely, it is trivial to show that if $u_t$ follows an autoregressive process, the above conditions does not hold anymore, in which case there is endogeneity, and OLS estimates are inconsistent. 

This and following pages go about explaining each of them, and how to measure them. Finally, the document provides a worked example of the table of "uses of output" (the expenditure approach of GDP). Here is a screenshot of a section of that worked example, presented in page 291. You can see that change in inventories are indeed treated as part of "Gross Capital Formation": 

To find the equilibrium however, the graph is not entirely helpful, because the optimal choice depends on how $p$ compares with the equilibrium price $p^*$, mentioned below. If $p>p^*$, a firm will want to produce infinity, or as high as possible. Conversely, if $p<p^*$, firms will no produce at all as any positive production leads to losses. 

This is taken from Bivens and Mishel (2015). In essence, they decompose labour productivity into its different components (see technical appendix, page 25). These components are three: 

Notice that these figures are gross cost estimates. I.e. they do not include indirect costs or benefits associated with it. For example, further costs might arise due to how the spending is financed. Such increase in spending would certainly require (i) more taxation, and/or (ii) more borrowing (cuts also possible, but less likely, due to party manifestos). The former could change incentives to work or invest (affecting growth), whereas the latter means higher borrowing costs, which have to be paid too. Regarding the benefits, if you have some belief in the fiscal multiplier, you could expect that part of that increase might be offset by extra revenues (income, VAT, etc) due to higher GDP (e.g. via consumption) from public workers. If this is a permanent increase, then such change in consumption is likely to be higher (at least according to the permanent income hypothesis). 

Conversely, China is a country, with a particular set of geopolitical goals, and which is interested (one guesses) in the wellbeing of their citizens. As such, the Chinese government uses institutions like the Exim Bank to provide loans to countries abroad where the Chinese government expects rewards. China is investing everywhere, Africa, Latin America, Asia. Some have even accused them of "neo-colonialism". 

For publicly own corporations, you can access their financial statements, where they record the amount of taxes paid (e.g. for Apple here). Notice that where the tax is paid depend on the location of the firm, and whether it is a multinational business. The latter type of firm is particularly problematic, because multinational companies use transfer pricing methods to optimise (i.e. lower) their tax burden. Therefore, it is difficult to determine where those taxes should be paid. Apple and other multinationals seem to be particularly keen to do this (e.g. here). The reason that sometimes you see headlines stating that big companies do not pay enough taxes locally is because many of these analysis is done by those with access to detailed information like HRMC or Inland Revenue (e.g. here; NB: excuse the doggy source; could not find a better one). Outsiders to these institutions can have access to this data only in a anonymous fashion (see data available for UK here), so you won't be able to trace Apple's taxation in the UK with such data (or at least you should not be able to do so). 

However, I have the impression that the feudal, or pre-capitalist societies, which were mainly agrarian and textile based, relied heavily on female labour. We can probably all picture housewives working in the field or sawing textiles. So, the question is, when and why women left the labour market? Is this because of a transition from feudalism toward a capitalistic mode of production? Or the shift from agriculture to industry? 

The axes represent the two goods. Their lengths are 1800 (global endowment of food, x axis) and 900 (global endowment of clothing, y axis). Point 3 represents the endowment point, which is (1200,300) for Home and (600,600) for Foreign. As the figure shows, that point is not an optimal allocation. Such optimal allocation is where the MRS for the two countries is the same (point 1), MRS which is equal to the relative price of goods (same for both countries, i.e. they are international prices). Therefore, this allocation has the following properties: $$ \frac{H_f^2}{2H_c} = \frac{F_f^2}{2F_c} = \frac{P_c}{P_f}$$ (I replaced $D$ with home and foreign letters, for clarity). Notice that the ratios of consumption are the same across countries. Yet, before trade, production is such that the ratio of food versus clothing is larger in home than in foreign. Therefore, home will export food and import clothing, and vice versa for foreign. Yet, since imports of one country are the exports of the other country, you get: $$ \frac{1200 - A}{300 + B} = \frac{600 + A}{600 - B} $$ where $A$ are exports of food and $B$ exports of clothing. Additionally, you have that the trade balance must be in equilibrium. Therefore: $$ P_fA = P_cB $$ Here you have all the equations you need to find the solution in terms of final consumption levels and relative prices. Let me know if this is enough. I can guide you further if you need. 

If you multiply the index by the population size (or the quantity used to compute the per person index), you get an index of the stock of human capital. For example, if for a given country the index is $h_t$ and population is $N_t$, then the stock is: $$ H_t = h_t \times N_t $$ Now, by the definition a stock follows an accumulation rule, just as physical capital: $$ H_{t+1} = H_t(1+d_t) + I_t $$ where $d_t$ is the "depreciation" of HK (e.g. because of death or skill obsolescence) and $I_t$ is gross investment in HK. Since you probably do not have data on depreciation (which I imagine is very difficult to compute), you can only calculate net investment, which is equivalent to net savings by definition: $$ S^h_t = H_{t+1} - H_t $$ Finally, to compute the savings rate, you need to divide this by a measure of GDP. However, these need to be measured in the same units. Therefore, you need to transform $H_t$ or $S^h_t$ into monetary units. For this you need something like the average price of human capital for every period, which I have never seen, and seems not available in Penn-world tables. 

The System of National Accounts (SNA) is the international standard regarding measurement and dissemination of National Accounts. It is produced by the United Nations. It's latest edition is 2008. Chapter 14 in this manual provides a very detailed account of who and how these statistics are obtained. A summary is shown in the image below:
