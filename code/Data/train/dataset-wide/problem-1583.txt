where Trottier 2012 is Recherche de signaux périodiques dans des spectres astronomiques, M.Sc. Thesis, Université Laval The modulation frequency seems to be of order 10${}^{-12}$ seconds, and the SDSS is (as far as I know) not really a particularly time-resolved data set. 1 micron wavelength light (for general reference) has a frequency of about 3x10${}^{-14}$. I'm not asking (necessarily) if this result is right or wrong, I'd just like to understand how the SDSS can actually be analyzed to detect or even infer THz rate modulation!

Wikipedia says that zenith is the second one (opposite local gravitational "down") which means that the answer would depend on how accurately you could measure this. If you had a plumb bob that could define your local zenith to say 0.01 degree (0.000175 radian) then using 6371 km as an average radius of the Earth, you could only define the location to about 1 kilometer. If you used a geometric or geodetic definition, and were calculating the zenith mathematically, then you could obtain a location to an accuracy of centimeters, again, mathematically. But this may or may not have any practical use. 

This tweet from CassiniSaturn shows an image of Saturn's rings being optically distorted by the dense atmosphere. It is explained more fully on this page and is available here. The refraction is visible because at at least some depth, the density and path length is sufficient to bend the light significantly while the density and composition is still sufficiently transparent. Roughly speaking, what is the density where this is taking place? Is it rarefied compared to earth but simply a very very long path length, or is this happening at a density far larger than Earth's surface atmosphere? How large is this refraction - like 0.1 degrees or 10 degrees? I can't picture the actual geometry very well. This one may be a bit of a judgement call, unless this image happens to be further documented somewhere.

I visited the linked article in Astronomy Now and found the URL of the image contained the string . STScI stands for Space Telescope Science Institute. Searching that string leads to 

The JPL Horizons website gives ephemerides for a large number of Earth satellites as well as deep space spacecraft, planets, moons, asteroids, etc. If you configure it as shown below, selecting the units you'd like, the full state vectors , use geocentric coordinates () you will get the following output. You can choose various time step sizes (down to 1 minute) and time frames. You can choose direct download as csv text rather than HTML if you like - recommended for long files. It looks to me that because of the special status and use of the LAGEOS satellites, the ephemeris only predicts a relatively short period into the future, unlike other spacecraft which have predictions for years sometimes. This should get you started! If you have more questions about this post as comments and I or someone else will try to help. 

The first two maps reflect data obtained from analysis of GAIA's measurement of starlight as explained in this answer, but the third map is described as "the distribution of interstellar gas and dust across the galaxy." As far as I understand, GAIA does not transmit all complete image data to Earth, but instead does a significant amount of image processing, object detection, classification and analysis, and other data reduction in order to extract positions and radial velocity measurements for point-like objects such as stars, though of course small solar system bodies such as comets and asteroids end up in the raw data as well. Question: How is interstellar gas density obtained from GAIA data? 

I'll make a very simple dimensional calculation here. Total power from of a star with radius $R$ and temperature $T$: $$ P_{tot} \ = \ R^2 \ T^4$$ Flux $I$ (power per unit area) at an orbital distance $r$: $$I \ = \ \frac{R^2 \ T^4}{r^2} \ = \ T^4 \ \left( \frac{R}{r} \right)^2$$ Apparent size (radians, small angle approx): $$\theta \ \approx \frac{R}{r}$$ So: $$\theta \ \approx \ \frac{\sqrt{I}}{T^2}$$ Surprisingly, for a fixed incident flux of light (ignoring different planetary warming effects of different wavelengths) the apparent size of a sun viewed from a star varies roughly as the inverse square of its temperature, and does not depend on the actual size of the star. Your milage may vary. Using Wein's dispacement law which relates the wavelength of maximum spectral radiance of a blackbody $\lambda_{max}$ with its temperature $T$ using Wien's displacement constant $b$: $$\lambda_{max} \ = \ \frac{b}{T}$$ The apparent size scales with the square of the peak wavelength of a star's blackbody spectrum. $$\theta \ \approx \ \lambda_{max}^2 \ \sqrt{I}$$ Yay! Reddish stars will appear much larger than bluish stars - the result we were all expecting. And if you'd like do some landscaping, the 2008 Scientific American article The Color of Plants on Other Worlds is a good read in stellar spectra, atmospheres, and photosynthesis. 

The BBC News item Light shed on mystery space radio pulses is interesting enough in its own right. But I noticed that it is reporting on news from the 231st meeting of the American Astronomical Society. These kinds of meetings are usually annual; for example the 120th Annual meeting of the American Physical Society will be in 2019. Were there enough astronomers in the US in 1787 to have an American Astronomical Society and it's first meeting? If it turns out that the answer is that meetings were more frequent than annual, why would that be? 

This recent paper in Nature A new type of solar-system material recovered from Ordovician marine limestone is available to read on line, and Figure 3 is already widely publicized. 

This version is from an article in Gizmodo where the credit reads: A radio image of Jupiter captured by the Very Large Array. Image: Imke de Pater, Michael H. Wong, Robert J. Sault and which cites the recent article in Science: Peering through Jupiter’s clouds with radio spectral imaging. However, that paper does not actually show this image. Another version of the image can be found in Berkeley News: New radio map of Jupiter reveals what’s beneath colorful clouds and gives more information how the image was produced. 

and using the script below to plot the results, I get the years 1995 and 2039 for the times that the comet passes 127 AU. That's about +/- 22 years from perihelion, nicely confirming userLTK's ballpark estimate. Outstanding is the question of the direction of the comet relative to any possible "tail" of the heliopause opposite the direction of the Sun. I think there is no hard, observational information about this currently, so sticking with an estimate of a radius seems acceptable.

The other answer (since deleted) is not right. The blob is a dozen pixels long, but monotonic in color change. It has nothing to do with the Bayer filter. It's almost certainly chromatic aberration from some combination of the telescope and eyepiece optics and the camera optics. The short focal length and therefore tiny entrance pupil size of a cell phone's camera only intercepts a small fraction of the bundle of rays from the eyepiece's exit pupil meant to fill a human pupil. If it were offset from the center, it would sample rays near the edge of the path, subjected most strongly to chromatic aberration. So even if the star appeared in the middle of the recorded image, this offset could result in a first-order dispersion. If you look at the three color "blobs" (caused by the shape of the transmission spectra of the three color filter types) the RED and GREEN blobs overlap, but the blue blob is offset much farther from the other two. This is consistent with the dispersion characteristics of glasses and plastic, where the index of refraction changes more and more rapidly toward the blue end of the spectrum, as the energy of the photons get closer to a real absorption edge somewhere in the UV. 

The caption may have been written in the 1970's. Is there still a mystery about the forces, or are things somewhat better understood now? The only other (fundamental) force that could be relevant is electric, but I wonder if that was meant to be implicit (as electromagnetic). See statement highlighted in bold below, as the caption continues:

And I even found a 1-bit ADC in Performance Measurements of 8-Gsps 1-bit ADCs Developed for Wideband Radio Astronomical Observations. I think I am just missing something obvious, but I can't understand how a measurement requiring high dynamic range gets by using few-bit ADCs. edit: Is it possible that the actual conversion of analog to digital is done to a far higher precision than suggested by the number of bits? 

I've located the mentioned Science article Localized aliphatic organic material on the surface of Ceres but it is paywalled. What was found? Is it some spectroscopic feature? Aliphatic compounds are hydrocarbons that are not aromatic. Is there a spectral feature that says "I am not aromatic" specifically, or does this just mean that aromaticity was not detected? 

UPDATE: The on-line simulation seems to be working beautifully now! I'd recommend anyone to go back and take another look to enjoy both the mathematical beauty of orbital mechanics, and the aesthetics of the solar system visualization! 

I am going to float this as a tentative answer. I'll appreciate feedback, either validating it or letting me know it's wrong, in which case I'll delete it. If it is part of a better answer, please run with it and I'll also delete this.

The calculation of the orbits of comets can be more difficult than those of most asteroids for a number of reasons. Some comets have such highly eccentric orbits that aphelion is too far for the comet to be observed continuously, or the period is so long that only one pass has been observed and a period can not be calculated, or it passes so close to the sun that it's orbit is highly modified. However comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko currently has a period of only about 6.4 years a perihelion/aphelion of 1.2 AU and 5.7 AU respectively. While it's orbit is within a so called "frost line" it remains further from the sun than the Earth's orbit. In this answer I plot some data from a recent NASA JPL Horizons ephemeris for comet 67P. The current default solution appears to use Marsden coefficients to model non-gravitational forces on the comet. Brian . Marsden was a British astronomer who contributed greatly to the field of cometary orbits. (See also here and here.) While exact modeling of non-gravitational forces on comets would be extremely complex, he introduced a simple empirical parameterization that provides a framework to discuss the magnitude and potential effects of these forces on the orbits of comets. Using the following convention: $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_R, \ \hat{\mathbf{e}}_T, \ \hat{\mathbf{e}}_N$ are unit vectors at the location of the comet in the radial, transverse, and normal directions where $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_R$ points away from the sun, $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_N$ is the direction of the angular momentum vector (perpendicular to the orbit plane) and $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_T$ is perpendicular to the first two and approximately in the direction of motion, non-gravitational accelerations can be parameterized using the empirical equations: $$\mathbf{a}_{NG} = ( A_1\hat{\mathbf{e}}_R \ + \ A_2\hat{\mathbf{e}}_T \ + \ A_3\hat{\mathbf{e}}_N) \ g(r), $$ where: $$g(r)= 0.111262\left(\frac{r}{2.808}\right)^{-2.15} \left(1+\left(\frac{r}{2.808}\right)^{5.093}\right)^{-4.6142}, $$ and the acceleration coeficients $A_1,A_2,A_3$ commonly have units of $AU / day^2$. I've reproduced these here to illustrate the basic idea. There are further considerations including a delay term and effects of rotation. However with this parameterization it is possible to discuss and at least get a handle on non-gravitational effects without a detailed physical model. These effects might the Yarkovsky and Poynting-Robertson effects, and of course recoil from material energetically ejected from the comet, especially as it approaches the sun and is heated. The parameters $A_1,A_2,A_3$ in model can be used to express effects from physical models of comets, but they can also be used as fitting parameters to improve orbital solutions for comets based on observational data.
