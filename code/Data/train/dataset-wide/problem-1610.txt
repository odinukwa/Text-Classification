There are two effects that alter the simple hyperbolic (or elliptic) relative orbit of any minor body ("moon") and a planet. First, the gravity of the Sun (and to a much lesser degree of Jupiter). To good approximation the planet-Sun system is a circular binary and the moon a test particle (its mass negligible). The orbits of test particles in such a system (known as the restricted three-body problem) are complicated, but the Jacobi energy, preventing capture (similar to the angular-momentum conservation for the hyperbolic orbit). Hence, capture requires deviation from this approximation, in particular the moon's mass must not be too small and/or another interacting body participates (the Wikipedia page on asteroid capture is quite disappointing). Second, tidal forces can transfer orbital energy into internal energy (of the planet and/or moon), which is then dissipated (converted into heat). Under lucky circumstances this process can be sufficient to convert an unbound to a bound orbit. Once bound, tides will continue to bind the moon more and more. 

there are no radial velocities in the required range observed, for example in the Milky Way galaxy. the reservoir of stars moving out from the centre would quickly be drained, so you would need to magically generate them at the centre -- this is much worse than postulating dark matter. you'd expect huge amounts of stars and gas that have moved out to large radii. 

Comets don't cross Earth's orbit really. Orbits are one-dimensional objects and their chance of crossing in 3D space is 0. Henceforth, I consider a comet at distance 1AU from the Sun. What's the maximum speed of a returning comet at 1AU from the Sun? This can be easily worked out from the orbial energy $$ E = \frac{1}{2}v^2 - \frac{GM_\odot}{r},\qquad\qquad(*) $$ which is conserved along the orbit ($v$ and $r$ the Heliocentric speed and distance). For a returning comet, $E<0$ and the speed cannot exceed the escape speed (which occurs for $E=0$) $$ v_{\rm escape}^2 = 2\frac{GM_\odot}{r}. $$ The speed of the Earth can be worked out from the Virial theorem, according to which the orbital averages of the kinetic and potential energies, $T=\frac{1}{2}v^2$ and $W=-GM_\odot/r$, satisfy $ 2\langle T\rangle + \langle W\rangle=0. $ For a (near-)circular orbit (such as Earth's), $r$ is constant and we have $ v^2_{\rm Earth} = GM_\odot/r. $ Thus, at $r$=1AU $$ v_{\rm escape} = \sqrt{2} v_{\rm Earth} $$ as already pointed out by Peter Horvath. Non-returning comets have local speed exceeding the escape speed. Can a comet near Earth have a speed similar to Earth's orbital speed?. Let's assume a comet with the same speed as Earth at $r$=1AU and work out the consequences. Such a comet must have the same orbital energy as the Earth and, since $$ E = -\frac{GM_\odot}{2a}\qquad\qquad(**) $$ with $a$ the orbital semimajor axis, must also have $a=1AU$ and the same orbital period as Earth, i.e. one year. Moreover, the comet's apohelion satisfies $$ r_{\rm apo}\le 2a = 2{\rm AU}. $$ Such comets don't exist AFAIK. Most returning comets have much longer periods than 1 year. What's the typical speed of a returning comet when at distance 1AU from the Sun? To work out this question, let's parameterise the comet's orbit by its period $P=2\pi\sqrt{a^3/GM_\odot}$. From this relation we immediately get $$ \frac{a_{\rm comet}}{\rm AU} = \left(\frac{P_{\rm comet}}{\rm yr}\right)^{2/3}. $$ From equations ($*$) and ($**$), we can then find $$ v_{\rm comet}(r=1{\rm AU}) = \sqrt{2-\left(\frac{P_{\rm comet}}{\rm yr}\right)^{-2/3}}\,v_{\rm Earth}. $$ In the limit of $P\to\infty$, this recovers our previous result $v_{\rm comet}\to v_{\rm escape}$. For typical period of $\sim$70yr, the speed of the comet is close to this number. Finally, I shall coment that all this only relates to the magnitude of the orbital velocity (speed), but not to its direction. Comets are typically on highly eccentric orbits and, when at $r$=1AU, move in quite a different direction than Earth, even if their speed is only slightly larger. So the relative speed $|\boldsymbol{v}_{\rm comet}-\boldsymbol{v}_{\rm Earth}|$ of a comet with respect to Earth can be anyting between about 10 and 70 km/s. 

Pick $M_{\mathrm{vir}}$ (or $M_{200}$) and redshift $z$ (and your favorite cosmology) Use above relation to find $r_{\mathrm{vir}}$ (or $r_{200}$) Use the relation from Napolitano et al. (2005), or equivalent, to find $c$ and hence $r_s$ Obtain $\rho_{\mathrm{DM}}$ (if you still need it) 

The simple answer is that the composition in terms of elements doesn't matter for the colour, since that is determined by the molecular composition as well as state (pressure and temperature) of the visual layers (which contain a small but significant fraction of other elements than H and He). Given the differences in the giant planets temperature and pressure, this molecular composition is most likely different. 

Such a three-body system is in principle expected to show a chaotic behavior sooner or later. Nope. Hierchical multiple systems (such as this), where the semi-major axes differ by a factor ten or larger may well be stable for ever (never become chaotic), in particular if the eccentricities are low and if the most massive object is in a tight binary. An unstable three-particle system will eventually result in (typically) the two most massive objects in a tight binary and the third particle ejected (unbound). The time scale for this to happen is of the order of several (10-100) dynamical times and is indeed a highly chaotic process. The concept of the Lyapunov time scale is not too useful here. One issue is that as soon as one object is ejected (unbound), the system is no longer bounded, when the concept of Lyapunov becomes problematic. Another issue is that the Lyapunov time is defined in the limit of infinite time and does not necessary reflect the behaviour of the system over any finite time. Finally, to answer your question. I think there is no stringent way. What one can do is to integrate numerically many realisations of the system, each equally in agreement with the data (and their uncertainties). Then one can see whether there are any stable configurations and how frequent they occur. Given that the system didn't form yesterday, it appears likely that it is indeed stable. 

I may just add to the excellent answer by Robert that interstellar dust particles, very much like cigarette smoke in air, hangs in the interstellar gas and interacts with it both kinematically (is dragged along with it depending on the particle size) and energetically (exchanges heat, which can result in significant cooling of the gas). Dust particles also interact with the (stellar) radiation and can be evaporated due to high-energy radiation, but can also grow by condensing from the surrounding gas. All larger solid astronomical objects (planets, asteroids etc, but not stellar remnants) have formed from dust, which in turn has formed from the heavier elements in the inter stellar gas. For many astronomical purposes, dust is annoying, as it blocks the light, in particular the shorter wave lengths (reddening and darking the light of stars), hiding stars, in particular in the mid-plane of the Milky Way. As a consequence, the Galactic centre, a place of great astronomical interest, is largely invisible and can only be studied by observing other wave lengths than visible light, in particular infrared which is hardly affected by dust absorption. 

All matter radiates (except if it's at absolute zero temperature), regardless of its composition (you got that of Mercury badly wrong). The most important form of radiation is the black-body radiation which only depends on the temperature of the material, but line emission and absorption may also be important (but depends on the composition and ionisation state of the material) and other emission and absorption processes. Stars are hot enough (the Sun has surface temperator $\sim5700$K) for the black-body radiation to peak in the visible part of the electro-magnetic spectrum. As a star shines, it looses energy, i.e. it cools, reducing the gas pressure that stabelizes it against gravitational collapse. In stars, this energy loss is balanced by the energy production from thermonuclear fusion in the core (requiring temperatures $\sim10^9$K). The transport of this energy to the surface makes stars non-trivial. In planets and brown dwarves, there is (by definition) no thermonuclear energy source. Therefore, these objects must shrink, which generates energy from gravity. However, they cannot shrink indefinitely, as ultimately quantum mechanics becomes important: Pauli's exclusion principle demands that the electrons cannot be arbitrarily closely packed. Thus, for brown dwarves and giant gas planets (but also white dwarves) further shrinking is halted at a radius comparable to that of Jupiter (Jupiter itself is still shrinking at a very small rate). These as well as all smaller objects then merely cool down very much like a piece of glowing coal. The situation is a often more complicated by sources of energy. Planets, for example are irradiated by their host star, which may dominate the energy gains at their surface (in addition, the Earth gains energy from nuclear fission in its core). The balance between this energy gain and the loss by black-body radiation determines the temperature of a planet. The Earth, for example, radiates in the infrared. However, the radiation losses are also regulated by line absorption of that infrared in the higher atomsphere by so-called green-house gases, in particular CO$_2$. 

Gravitational lensing is just geometry, as is optical lensing. The amplification factor describes the increase of the area of the image (at constant surface brightness). BTW, the amplification factor does depend on the mass $M$ of the lens, since $u=\theta/\theta_E$ and $\theta_E$ depends on $M$. Here $\theta$ and $\theta_E$ are the relative angular distance between source and lens and the radius (angle) of the Einstein ring for the lens, respectively.
