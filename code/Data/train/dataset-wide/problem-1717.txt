Most stars are of a solar-mass or below. The average number of companions that each stars has (in the sense of being part of binary or higher multiple systems) systems ranges from 0.75 for stars of a solar mass to approximately 0.35 (not a well-established number) for the more numerous M-dwarfs. Let's take a compromise value, say 0.5. The separation distribution of these multiples peaks at around 50 AU for solar-type stars, reducing to about 5 AU for low-mass M dwarfs. Again, lets take a compromise value of 20 AU. See Duchene & Kraus (2013) for all the details. So if we take 1000 stars, then 333 of them (roughly speaking) are companions to another 333 stars, while 333 are isolated single stars. (NB This does not mean the frequency of multiple systems is 50%, because some of the companions will be in higher order multiple systems) Thus, taking your calculation of the separation between stellar systems of 5 light years ($= 3.2\times10^{5}$ AU), then the mean separation is: $$\bar{D} = 0.667\times 20 + 0.333 \times 3.2\times10^{5} \simeq 10^{5} AU, $$ but the median separation is 20 AU! This is of course sophistry, because I'm sure your question is really, why are stellar systems so far apart? Stars (and stellar systems) are born in much denser environments. The number density of stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC - the nearest very large stellar nursery) is about 1 per cubic light year. The equivalent number for the solar neighbourhood is 0.004 stars per cubic light year. Thus the average interstellar separation in the ONC is 1 light year, but in the solar neighbourhood it is about 6.3 light years. The reason for this separation at birth is the Jeans length - the critical radius at which a clouds self-gravity will overcome its thermal energy and cause it to collapse. It can be expressed as $$\lambda_J = c_s \left( \frac{\pi}{G\rho } \right)^{1/2},$$ where $c_s$ is the sound speed in a molecular cloud and $\rho$ its density. For star forming giant molecular clouds $c_s = 0.2$ km/s and $\rho=10^{-23}$ kg/m$^3$. So clouds of scale hundreds of light years could collapse. As they do, the density increases and the Jeans length becomes smaller and allows the cloud to fragment. Exactly how far the fragmentation goes and the distribution of stellar masses it produces is an area of intense research, but we know observationally that it can produce things like the ONC or sometimes even more massive and dense clusters. From there we know that a new born cluster of stars tends not to survive very long. For various reasons - outflows, winds and ionising radiation from newborn stars are able to heat and expel the remaining gas; star formation appears to have an average efficiency of a few to perhaps 20-30%. Expelling the gas, plus the tidal field of the galaxy breaks up the cluster and disperses it into the field, which gives us the lower field star (or system) density that we see around us. Once the stars are part of the field they essentially don't interact with each other; they are too far apart to feel the influence of individual objects and move subject to the overall gravitational potential of the Galaxy. so your consideration of the force between stars is not really relevant. 

Your logic isn't unsound. By symmetry there would be a gravitational neutral point between them. Of course, the black holes could not then be described by the Schwarzschild metric, since that only applies to a spherically symmetric situation. As you brought the black holes closer together, the isopotentials would become distinctly aspherical, the event horizons would be complicated shapes and ultimately would merge - although as the black holes would presumably be in orbit and rotating, the spacetime geometry would be even more complex than that. 

OK, so I don't think the article is claiming that it is a place "without matter", but that it is a large region of space where the density of matter is lower. The original research, published in 2007, suggests that a lack of radio sources seen in a particular direction coincides with a "cold-spot" that is seen in the cosmic microwave background by WMAP (which has since been confirmed by Planck). They calculate that if the void were completely empty it would need to be about 280 Mpc across and at redshifts $z\leq 1$. Galaxies certainly could be seen on the other size of this void. Many of the galaxies in their survey must have considerably higher redshifts and are more distant. The cold spot could be caused by such a void, because light is redshifted as it travels through gravitational fields. The Sachs-Wolfe effect, as it is known, causes large scale perturbations in the cosmic microwave background as light travels from the distant past, when the CMD was generated, to us in the present day. It is argued that a large void that is comparatively empty of both visible and dark matter, but which has dark energy. The way it works is that photons works against gravity to enter a void, loses energy, but then gain back some of that energy as it leaves the void. However, the expansion of the universe means that in the time taken to cross the void the amount that is regained is not as much as was lost in the first place. "What if a black hole were to appear"? Not clear what you mean by this. Black holes are black, you wouldn't necessarily see them, however if the "void" or lack of radio galaxies was compensated for by an equivalent amount of mass that was for some reason invisible then it would not explain the CMB cold spot. The idea of a "supervoid" causing the CMB cold spot has also been supported by other surveys of extragalactic sources (Szapudi et al. 2015), but you are correct that the size of this void is difficult to understand in terms of current cosmological assumptions. 

The timescale on which Jupiter cools is reasonably well understood and predicted by the current generation of evolutionary models. Jupiter's luminosity is provided mostly by gravitational contraction. For a planet that only contains gas governed by the perfect gas law, the appropriate timescale for this contraction (or indeed for the luminosity to fall significantly) is given by the Kelvin Helmholtz timescale. $$ \tau = \eta \frac{GM^2}{RL},$$ where $M$ and $R$ are Jupiter's mass and radius and $L$ is its current power output (or luminosity), and the parameter $\eta \sim 1$. This timescale is a few $10^{11}$ years. However, giant planets like Jupiter are not governed by perfect gas laws. The gas in the centre of Jupiter is dense enough that electrons become degenerate. Degenerate electrons fill the available energy levels up to the Fermi energy. Their consequent non-zero momenta of the electrons exerts a degeneracy pressure that is independent of temperature. As a result, the rate of contraction slows and the release of gravitational potential energy slows; the planet is able to cool and remain in hydrostatic equilibrium without the same degree of contraction. One can express this change using the $\eta$ parameter. For Jupiter $\eta \simeq 0.03$ (Guillot & Gautier 2014) - i.e. the timescale for the luminosity to fade is 30 times quicker than the naive Kelvin-Helmholtz time and Jupiter's luminosity will scale as the reciprocal of its age and will fall by a factor of a few in $10^{10}$ years. In a trillion years, the luminosity of Jupiter will be lower than it is now by roughly a factor of 250. 

The Sun orbits in the entire Galactic gravitational potential, which is very approximately similar to that provided by considering that all the mass interior to its Galactic orbit (about 100 billion solar masses) were concentrated at the Galactic centre. The black hole at the centre has a mass of 4 million Suns, so contributes less than 0.01% of the mass required to keep the Sun in its present Galactic orbit of about 200 million years. Or to put it another way, if the Sun just orbited the black hole with a period of 200 million years, we would need to be about 800 light years from the Galactic centre, rather than the 30,000 light years we presently are.
