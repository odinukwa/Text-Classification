None of the other obvious statistics that describe this map are in the OEIS yet. Here are naive python implementations of $B_L, B_R, B_L^{-1}, B_R^{-1}$ if you want to check these assertions. 

Propp redoes, clarifies and generalizes domino shuffling in the following lovely paper: Propp, James. "Generalized domino-shuffling." Theoretical Computer Science 303, no. 2 (2003): 267-301. $URL$ The redone explanation is a way of thinking of the domino shuffle map locally, using a graph transformation called urban renewal; these days people also call it the spider move. The move replaces a 4-cycle in a graph (the "square", we might call it) with an 8-vertex graph made of a 4-cycle with a pendant edge on each vertex (the "spider"); the feet of the spider get attached where the vertices of the square were. Spider moves, when combined with a suitable reweighting of the edges in the graph, preserve the generating function for perfect matchings up to an explicit constant. The argument is much like the one in Elkies-Kuperberg-Larsen-Propp which you're asking about, but it is substantially streamlined because you only have to think about the square and the spider. In answer to your question: once you understand this point of view, odd-deficiency is obvious. When you reconstruct the domino shuffle using spider moves (which Propp explains how to do in the same paper), the squares and the spiders comprise the odd blocks, and all the action happens within them. The even blocks do not enter into the picture at all. As further evidence that the spider move is the correct point of view, Kenyon-Goncharov $URL$ recently used the spider move to define a certain cluster integrable system for the dimer model. 

I doubt there's a completely standard definition. It seems like this is elementary -- an undirected edge is a size-$k$ subset of $[1,n]$, and a directed edge is an undirected edge together with one of the possible $2^k$ labellings of it with "T" and "H". So the number of different edges is (if, say, empty head- and tail-sets are allowed) $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^k = 3^n$ Presumably a directed hypergraph consists of any collection of such edges, so there are $2^{3^n}$ of them. If this isn't the precise question you were wondering about, I'd wager that the one you're interested in is just as easy to count. 

Based on my (amateur) research, what would be of particular interest with respect to your proof is the question of whether you can extend it into the $2$-adic metric space and show that the same holds for the limit in the $2$-adic metric space of $1 \mod 2^n$ as $n\to\infty$. Which would of course, prove the conjecture. 

This is a fairly substantial rewriting of my original answer. Sharkovski's theorem, which unfortunately only applies to $\mathbb{R}$ is the definitive theorem in this field and one thing it states is that all cycles will be of order a power of 2, else there will be infinitely many. If it could be extended to $2\mathbb{N}-1$ (or to some suitable extension of $2\mathbb{N}-1$) such that it applied to the Collatz conjecture then the existence of any nontrivial cycle would imply the existence of infinitely many nontrivial loops of certain orders; including a cycle of length 2, contradicting Lagarias (1985) result that there are no nontrivial cycles with length $<275000$ (and therefore proving the weakened Collatz Conjecture; that the are no non-trivial cycles). ST states that a continuous interval to interval function having cycles on $\mathbb{R}$ of a certain order must also have cycles other orders. The orders which must exist are arranged in a hierarchy called Sharkovskii's ordering. Only by talking of loops in the Collatz Conjecture directly from one odd number to the next, i.e. of the function $f(x)=\dfrac{3x+1}{2^{v_2(3x+1)}}$ is it possible for ST to apply. This is because the existence of the trivial $3$-cycle in the conventional formulation is immediately contradictory, while the $1$-cycle in the $2\mathbb{N}-1\to2\mathbb{N}-1$ formulation is not. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable it seems likely such a proof would require a morphism from an interval of $\mathbb{R}$ to some uncountable superset $S$ of $2\mathbb{N}-1$ such that $f(x)$ in $S$ is a continuous function in $\mathbb{R}$. Sequences and cycles in $2\mathbb{N}-1$ are of course isomorphic to a wide range of sequences and cycles which are isometric in some valuation $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$. The true, possible, extent of $S$ therefore is governed by our capacity to define some valuation $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$ which is sufficiently expressive in measuring powers of $2$ to project every $x\in S$ down to a unique element $n$ of $2\mathbb{N}-1$ and the valuation $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$ such that $x=n\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}^{-1}$. The 2-adic valuation over $\mathbb{N}$ is such an example. There's a high probability we require here some extension of the 2-adic valuation to some uncountable superset of $\mathbb{N}$ which is capable of measuring non-integer powers of $2$ to sufficient degree that it captures the full structure of $\mathbb{R}$. The morphism to $\mathbb{R}\to S$ would probably require the property that numbers in $S$ of the form $x\times\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}\in(2\mathbb{N}-1)$ are mapped to an interval in $\mathbb{R}$. This is necessary because proper fractions which are not dyadic, DO have nontrivial cycles in this extension of the Collatz conjecture. Therefore the morphism would need to isolate the integers, proper dyadic fractions, (and any extension thereof satisfying $x\times\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}\in(2\mathbb{N}-1)$ to some interval of $\mathbb{R}$ and map the other numbers to other segments of $\mathbb{R}$ Furthermore, for the function $f(x)$ to be well-defined $2^{v_2(x)}$ must be extended so as to retain isometry as measured by $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$ of all orbits of $f$ in $S$. The appropriate extension of $2^{v_2(x)}$ is of course the inverse of $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$ and the successor relation defined by the extended form of $f$ can be defined by: $x_{n+1}=\lvert x_0\rvert_{2\times}^{-1}(3x_n+1)\lvert 3x_n+1\rvert_{2\times}$ 

More precisely, I am interested in the "Bose-Mesner Algebra" point of view on this scheme. It is known that all the matrices in the algebra defined by this association scheme diagonalize in the same basis. 

Hi, I have no idea where to look for, so I'm hoping you can give me some pointers. I'm interested by numbers of form $p-1$ when $p$ is a prime number. Do they have a name, so that I can google them? More precisely, I'm interested in their factors. Ok, obviously 2 is a factor, but what about the others? Are there a lot of small factors? Do we know the rate of the growth of its larger factor, is it linear, logarithmic? Thanks. 

This problem arises while studying the complexity of algorithms and I am quite unfamiliar with the subject. Consider the set F of injective functions from {1..N} to {1..M} we can define an association scheme on F x F by (f,f') and (g,g') are in the same class if there is a permutation $\pi\in S_M$ and a permutation $\tau \in S_N$ such that $g = \pi \circ f \circ \tau$ and $g' = \pi \circ f' \circ \tau$. I checked that this really defines an association scheme. In a way it is an "ordered" version of the Johnson scheme. It seems to me that it is a natural extension of the Johnson scheme, but I did not find any reference about it. 

-- Some background on Association Schemes. An association scheme is a set of symmetric boolean matrices $A_1, \dots , A_S$ such that 1) $\sum_{i=1}^s A_i =J$ the all-one-matrix 2) $A_1 = I$ the identity matrix 3) $\forall i,j \; A_iA_j \in {\rm span} ( A_i )$ The matrices $A_i$ can be seen as adjency matrix for some graph (but I don't think it might help here) The span{$A_i$} defines an algebra called the Bose-Mesner Algebra. Condition (3) implies that all matrices commute so they diagonalize in the same basis. -- In the case I'm considering here, the dimension of the $A_i$ is ${M \choose N}N!\times {M \choose N}N!$. The $A_i$ are not explicitly defined but we know that $[A_i]_{fg}=[A_i]_{f'g'}$ if there is a permutation $\pi\in S_M$ and a permutation $\tau \in S_N$ such that $g = \pi \circ f \circ \tau$ and $g' = \pi \circ f' \circ \tau$. -- About the Johnson scheme: The $A_i$ have size ${M \choose N}$. The rows and the columns of the matrices are labeled by subsets of size $N$ of {$1,\dots,M$}. (in my case, the labels are injective functions, ie. ordered sets of subsets of size $N$ of {$1,\dots,M$}. $[A_i]_{ab}=[A_i]_{a'b'}$ if there is a permutation $\pi\in S_M$ such that $\pi(a) = a'$ and $\pi(b) = b'$. (where $\pi(a)$ denotes the subset of {$1,\dots,M$} obtained by applying the permutation $\pi$ to the elements of the sets $a$. 

The full detail of this is of course a complex matter but I can build out some structure and connect the problem to some powerful tools for you; namely that, like the Collatz conjecture, this structure descends linear combinations of Lucas sequences. The floor function of dividing by two descends the sequences $x_{n+1}=2x_n+1$; e.g.: $0,1,3,7,15,31,63,\ldots$ Which should be fairly obvious. Furthermore if you divide alternate numbers in this sequence by $3$ you have the immediate odd predecessors of $1$ in the Collatz graph; namely $\{1,5,21,85,341,\ldots\}$ so the connection is fairly obvious. Numbers just below any descending sequence converge to the same path. In fact the catchment gets wider the higher up the sequence you go, so e.g. $\{62,61,60\}$ go to $15$ then $\{62,61,60,59,58,57,56\}$ go to $7$ etc. Of course your function will descend these sequences and their neighbourhoods until it hits some highest prime so to build the graph it's necessary to break apart the descending sequences at the prime numbers and graph those upwards to $x^2$ instead of down, connecting the next descending sequence. I happened to choose the Mersenne numbers, and there are likely infinitely many prime examples although like all Lucas sequences of the first kind this is a divisibility sequence and therefore only a number with a prime index can itself be prime. But this isn't generally the case in all of your function's descending sequences. The Mersenne numbers are the Lucas sequence $U_n(3,2)$. You can generate every such descending sequence which your function descends, by the linear combinations of $U_n(3,2)$ with its companion $V_n(3,2)=2,3,5,9,17,33\ldots$ $U_n$ is the sequence $2^n-1$ while $V_n$ is the sequence $2^n+1$ so they converge in $\Bbb{Z}_2^{\times}$ to $\pm1$ giving you a set dense enough in $\lvert\cdot\rvert_2$ that perhaps intuitively hints at them covering a set $\{z_1,z_2\in\Bbb{N}:\lvert z_1-z_2\rvert_2\leq\frac{1}{2}\}$ i.e. having an integrality gap of 2 - the odd numbers. To fully index your descending sequences, and graph the vertices where they stop descending and go up, you need to identify the set of linear combinations of these such that the least value in the sequence is a prime number. To do that, you need the set of primes $p$ such that $2p+1$ is not prime and define the sequence $S_p=a\cdot U_n(3,2)+b\cdot V_n(3,2)$ by setting $b\cdot V_0(3,2)=p$ and choosing $a$ such that $S_{p+1}=2p+1$ That gives you the set of sequences: $S_p=(\frac{p}{2}+1)\cdot U_n(3,2)+(\frac{p}{2})\cdot V_n(3,2)$ Next you need to build the successor relation between these sequences; i.e. from the prime at the base of one, to the next descending sequence via the function $x^2$. A (fairly obvious) observation is that the floor function of an odd square halved is equal to $\frac{n^2-1}{2}$. All odd squares are of the form $4n+1$ so the function $p^2$ will always be followed by at least a division by $4$, so we will always have: $\dfrac{p^2-1}{4}$ before possibly more divisions by $2$. The next part of the exercise is to show that the function $x^2$ totally orders these sequences $S_p(3,2)$. I could go on but you are probably bored (and answering Collatz-related questions can be risky for low-rep users!) Hopefully I have built out a good amount of the structure which others with greater skills than me may be able to take further. Another critical structural note to bear in mind is that once you have eliminated unnecessary structure such as perhaps the even numbers, the leaves of this graph, if there are any, will initially be among the primes $p$ for which $2p+1$ is also a prime since these $p$ are the primes which cannot be descended to down some sequence $S_n$ (as obviously any such descent would stop at $2p+1$ and ascend, if $2p+1$ were prime). But if I were a betting man I would predict that the "unnecessary structure" is actually pretty complex and there is a vast amount to be whittled away, and that in the final construct of this graph, the Mersenne Primes may actually be the leaves of the graph, and that the proof this converges to a cycle for all inputs is largely equivalent to there being infinitely many Mersenne Primes. But that is conjecture. There is a vast array of research into Lucas sequences and numerous algebraic structures underpin any set of linear sequences of them as per the link I gave above. The next part of the exercise I would suggest is to take a look at that structure and find how it determines that the function $p\to p^2$ preorders the sequences $S_p=(\frac{p}{2}+1)\cdot U_n(3,2)+(\frac{p}{2})\cdot V_n(3,2)$
