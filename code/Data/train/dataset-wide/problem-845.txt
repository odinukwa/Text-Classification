The actual number of stars inside $R$ is simply $n$ multiplied by the number of stars in the cluster, $N$. We’ll take $N\sim10^3$, a decently sized cluster. How do we now go from $n\cdot N$ to number density, $\mathcal{N}$ (just to make things more confusing)? Well, take the formula for the mass $M$ of a sphere inside a radius $R$ with radial density $\rho(r)$: $$M=\int_0^R 4\pi r^2\rho(r)\mathrm{d}r$$ Simply divide $M$ by the average mass of a star (which I’ll get to later, but is unimportant for now) and we get $$n\cdot N=\int_0^R4\pi r^2\mathcal{N}(r)\mathrm{d}r$$ We just differentiate and divide: $$\mathcal{N}(r)=\frac{\mathrm{d}n}{\mathrm{d}r}N\frac{1}{4\pi r^2}\tag{2}$$ In the code, we add 

More to be added whenever they pop into my head. It's just going to be a fun little list. Note: Pretty much all of these things are highly unlikely. I'm taking a short break from science. It's quite relaxing. 

I'll first address Cha 110913-773444 specifically. Checking the Wikipedia page yields some interesting information: 

I like to use Kasting et al. (1993) when talking about better climate models of planets around main sequence stars, as it evaluates habitable zones in while taking into account atmospheric effects. Anyway, the authors address your specific question, calculating the tidal locking radius $r_{\tau}$ after a time $t$ for a planet described by a dissipation function $Q$ with an original rotational period of $P_0$ orbiting a star of mass $M$: $$r_{\tau}=0.027\left(\frac{P_0t}{Q}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}M^{\frac{1}{3}}$$ They use the values, for a somewhat Earth-like planet, of 

You've obviously avoided the second pitfall by starting at a certain level of science and sticking to it. You've avoided the first by not trying to explain away every single bit of the premise. So, in summary: Yes, I think this would work, and I think it's convincing enough if you state it like this.

The sites are clustered around Minneapolis/St. Paul, to protect the Twin Cities population center and general industrial area. According to Wikipedia, the Nike missiles (in the Zeus B (XLIM-49A) form) had a range of 250 miles. By some rough eyeballing, the Canadian/American border is, at its closest, a bit over 250 miles away from Minneapolis/St. Paul, making it impossible for this missile site to effectively protect the cities - unless a Soviet bomber made an approach from the north, which would be the likely attack route. However, the site would still be redundant, given the four sites around the Twin Cities. Are there any other potential targets in Minnesota? Here's a present day population distribution (I'm assuming that during the Cold War, the population, though less, had roughly the same distribution): 

That's a huge size range! So these people are going to have skeletons just as strong as normal humans - if not stronger. You could argue that stiffness could lead to bones being more brittle, but I think the increased bone density could help with that. The cultural aspect is a bit tougher. You could argue that the strength increase would increase and warlike or violent tendencies in the species, though that might be a weak argument. I don't think it would give the beings any advantages, though, because the decreased height would mean that they would weigh less that normal humans, assuming an equal body density. I suppose it depends on just what caused them to have to bone density they have. Could their ancestors have be avian? Are they avian? In that case, we enter the realm of bird culture. In early bird-like civilizations, the sky might be revered, and the sky god(s) could hold more sway in mythology than the sun god(s). The ground might be feared, or associated with the afterlife, as the ancient Greeks and Romans associated the underground with death and the afterlife. 

If the fission hypothesis is true, then circumbinary protoplanetary disks should form in the same plane as the orbits of the stars, meaning that the ecliptic would match up (see these notes for more details). There might be some variation - maybe less than 10 degrees - but not much. In the case of planets orbiting only one of the stars, things are different. There are plenty of cases of single-star disk misalignment in young binary systems. For instance, Jensen & Akeson (2014)1 looked at the young system HK Tauri and measured a misalignment of 60 to 68 degrees between the protoplanetary disks around each star, meaning that at least one is rotated quite far outside the orbital plane of the stars. 

This represents what would happen if the ocean and atmosphere were not connected - which they are. Now do the experiment with the bottle open. 

The term I’ve seen used to describe the necessary solvents for silicon-based life is cryosolvent. In Planets and Life: The Emerging Science of Astrobiology, by Sullivan & Ross (relevant excerpt here), the authors cite the work of Bains (2004) on various alternate solvents to form the basis for various alien biochemistries. Ethane, methane, and liquid dinitrogen are all considered as possibilities, with liquid dinitrogen showing the most promise for silicon-based life. At low temperatures, silicon-silicon chains can exist, containing up to 30 silicon atoms and mimicking the structure of certain carbon polymers1. As noted here, these chains aren’t as stable as carbon chains, and less stable in many liquids. However, this becomes less of a problem at low temperatures. Furthermore, as Bains’ website says, silicon may be the only option for liquid dinitrogen. Almost paradoxically, silicon-based life has advantages over carbon at high temperatures, as the Center for Astrophysics discusses! Silicon-oxygen and silicon-aluminum bonds can withstand temperatures hundreds of kelvin above temperatures on Earth. However, the lack of a good solvent that is compatible with silicon at these temperatures is a stumbling block. Sulfuric acid has been considered as a solvent, but not, as far as I know, with silicon. As mentioned here, silicon photosynthesis is also possible. However, be careful before drawing a direct analogy between silicon-based life and carbon-based life in terms of respiration. As shown here, SiO2 produced from respiration (the analogue to CO2) would be solid, which would make it very difficult for an organism to breathe. Bains writes on his website that you could create a system analogous to the Krebs Cycle using ethylene, acetylene, and water, which would generate CO2 and methane, but he doesn't discuss if and how fast this could happen at low temperatures. You still have the problem of instability of silicon-silicon chains when faced with water.
