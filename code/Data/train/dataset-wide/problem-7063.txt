Looking two slides before, the author provides another utility function, under "Separable Utility" this time: $$U(c,n) = \ln(c) - a\frac {n^{1+1/v}}{1+1/v}$$ Comparing the two I believe we can safely reach the conclusion that the author had implicitly in mind "additive separability", i.e. a functional form where second partials are zero, irrespective of whether a transformation can separate the arguments of the function. At least in some corners, when one needs the logarithmic transformation to induce separability, one talks about "multiplicatively separable" preferences. 

Working the implied inequalities we re-write the solution as $$\beta_i < \frac 1{1+r} \implies \{x_{1i}^* = (1+r)^{-1},\;\;x_{2i}^* = 0\}$$ $$\beta_i > \frac 1{1+r} \implies \{x_{1i}^* = 0,\;\;x_{2i}^* = 1\}$$ In the $N$-identical individuals case, and with $\beta_i, i=1,...,N$ being a random variable we can only talk about expected demand in the first period, denote it $E(d_{1i})$ for the individual and $E(D_1) = N\cdot E(d_{1i})$ on aggregate. We have $$E(d_{1i}) = \frac 1{1+r} \cdot \Pr\left[\beta_i < \frac 1{1+r}\right] + 0 \cdot \Pr\left[\beta_i > \frac 1{1+r}\right] $$ The second term vanishes. Given the assumptions on the distribution of the $\beta$'s its density function over the domain is $f(\beta_i) =2$ and so the remaining probability is (as long as $r \leq 1$) $$\Pr\left[\beta_i \leq \frac 1{1+r}\right] = \int_{1/2}^{(1+r)^{-1}}2{\rm d}\beta_i = 2\left(\frac 1{1+r}-\frac 12\right) = \frac {1-r}{1+r}$$ and so we have $$E(D_1) = \frac N{1+r}\cdot \frac {1-r}{1+r} = \frac {1-r}{(1+r)^2}N$$ which is decreasing in $r$. If $r$ hits unity, expected demand will be zero -because a) It would place a solvency ceiling to loan demand to be not higher than $1/2$ so that with interest rate $100\%$ all production of the second period would then be needed to repay the loans. This means that with $r=1$, maximum consumption (and utility) in the first period will not exceed $1/2$. b) the discount factor being greater or equal than $1/2$, implies that by taking zero loan in the first period, one would enjoy the full unitary production of the second period, with utility higher than $1/2$. So for non-zero demand for loans in the first period, it must be the case that this demand can exceed $1/2$. When $r\geq 1$ it cannot, hence the zero expected demand. Note: if instead of a "stochastic distribution" of the $\beta$'s we think of a "uniform allocation" of them in the $[1/2,1]$ interval, then we can think of expected demand as deterministic demand. 

Upgrading an exchange of comments, a critical point in the question is the expression \begin{align} \frac{\partial u(\tilde x)}{\partial \rho}=\frac{1}{(\rho + u'(\tilde x) + 1)^2} \end{align} which is mistaken , because from \begin{align} u(\tilde x) = \frac{\rho + u'(\tilde x)}{\rho + u'(\tilde x) + 1}. \end{align} we obtain \begin{align} \frac{\partial u(\tilde x)}{\partial \rho}=\frac{1+\partial u'(\tilde x)/\partial \rho}{(\rho + u'(\tilde x) + 1)^2} \end{align} The OP notes that the sign of $\partial u'(\tilde x)/\partial \rho$ is indeterinate, and so $\partial u(\tilde x)/\partial \rho$ cannot be said to be monotonically increasing, which was what drove the pinning-down of the steady state. 

Correct approach: there is reliable information (from the vendor and/or from past experience), that the machine can perform $T$ number of tests in total before being scrapped or taken out of service. Then the cost of the machine per se allocated to the execution of one test is $10.000 / T$. In the OP's case, a straight-line depreciation method is applied, writing-off $2.000$ per year. The problem here in the calculation $2.000/T_i$ for year $i$, is that next year, if the number of tests is more/less, one will get a different cost allocation of the value of the machine on a single test -and it will be misleading. So for economic-costing purposes this is not advised. But for purposes of reconciliation with accounting practice year-by-year, then one could accept the artificial variation, if one cannot apply the correct approach. A mitigating approach, if historical data exist, is to take "average yearly tests performed", and divide $2.000$ with this average. 

Pooled regression on a panel-data sample, indeed, does not take the time dimension into account. This is why it is called "pooled": we ignore the fact that for each cross-section we have a time series, and we treat the whole panel-data sample as though it were a cross-sectional one, as if, say, $x_{it}$ and $x_{i,t+1}$ are diffrenet cross sections. 

In the (quantity, income) space, not being everywhere differentiable would mean that we would observe gaps, discontinuous jumps, or kinks, in the corresponding graph of the Marshallian individual demand function. GAPS: if there was a gap, it would mean that for a certain range of income, the demand function does not exist. In other words, it is not defined for a certain range of income (but it still is defined with respect to prices). This could be interpreted that for this range, income does not affect quantity demanded. So "differentiable everywhere" excludes such a phenomenon. DISCONTINUOUS JUMPS: If there was a discontinuous jump, it would mean that a specific level of income induces a "threshold effect" on quantity demanded. So "differentiable everywhere" necessitates that no such effects exist on quantity demanded. KINKS: If there was a kink, we would have a "second-order" threshold effect, where quantity demanded would change at a discontinuous rate with respect to income. So "differentiable everywhere" excludes such phenomena. These should now be "mathematicized" and projected back to the properties of the utility function (if, that is, they are relevant to it). Note: In many utility maximization problems, income does not enter the utility function, but it is part of the problem's constraints. In others, we postulate a utility function as a bivariate function of one good and income. 

I am not sure that elasticities converge for arbitrary growth rates. Here is a treatment of the issue. Subscripts in $F$ denote partial derivatives. I will omit the time subscript. By definition, the elasticity of the $i$-th input is the ratio of marginal product ($F_i$) over Average Product $(F/x_i)$. So for an elasticity to stabilize intertemporally, it must be the case that the growth rate of the marginal product is equal to (or equalizes a the limit with) the growth rate of the average product. For input $x_{1}$ we have $$\frac {d}{dt} F_1 = F_{11}\dot x_{1} +F_{12}\dot x_{2} +...+F_{1n}\dot x_{n}$$ All inputs are strictly positive so we can multiply and divide, and also divide by $F_1$ to obtain the growth rate (denoted by a tilde) $$\tilde {F_1} = \frac {dF_1/dt}{F_1} = \frac{F_{11} x_1}{F_1}\frac{\dot x_{1}}{x_1} + ... +\frac{F_{1n} x_n}{F_1}\frac{\dot x_{n}}{x_n}$$ The first ratio in each term is the elasticity of the $F_1$ with respect to each input, say $\eta_{1k}$. So, $$\tilde {F_1} = \sum_{k=1}^n\eta_{1k}g_k $$ and analogously for the other inputs. Turning to the average product of the first input, we have $$\frac {d}{dt} (F/x_1 ) = \frac {F_1x_1 - F}{x_1^2}\dot x_1 + \frac {F_2}{x_1}\dot x_2+...+\frac {F_n}{x_1}\dot x_n$$ Manipulating, $$\frac {d}{dt} (F/x_1 ) = \left[F_1-\frac {F}{x_1} \right]g_1 + \frac{F}{x_1}\frac{F_2x_2}{F} \frac {\dot x_2}{x_2}+...+\frac{F}{x_1}\frac{F_nx_n}{F} \frac {\dot x_n}{x_n}$$ $$= \frac {F}{x_1}\cdot \Big( (e_1-1)g_1 + e_2g_2 + ...+ e_ng_n\Big)$$ $$\implies \frac {d(F/x_1)/dt}{(F/x)} = \tilde F - g_1 = \sum_{k=1}^ne_kg_k - g_1$$ So for all elasticities to stabilize (and so for $\tilde F$ to stabilize) we want, at least eventually, that $$ \forall i=1,...,n\;\;\; \sum_{k=1}^n\eta_{ik}g_k = \sum_{k=1}^ne_kg_k - g_i$$ Denoting $\mathbf H$ the $n\times n$ the matrix of the elasticities of the marginal products, $\mathbf I_n$ the identity matrix, $\mathbf e$ an $n \times 1$ vector containing the output elasticities $e_i$, $\mathbf i$ a column vector of ones, and $\mathbf g$ the $n \times 1$ column vector of growth rates of inputs, we can write the conditions for all elasticities to be stable compactly , as $$\big(\mathbf H + \mathbf I_n - (\mathbf i \oplus \mathbf e')\big)\mathbf g =0$$ I note that the sum-of-matrices term does not depend at all on the growth rates vector. So the above orthogonality condition cannot hold for arbitrary $\mathbf g$ (except if I am neglecting some property stemming from the homogeneity of $F$). 

This is a transaction where productive assets change hands, it is not a transaction that reflects production. Moreover assume that the company oparates exactly as before, producing the same output in quantity and quality and with the same prices and with the same costs. Then nothing has changed in the economy as regards production (and so income). The only difference is that the previous owners of the company now have in their hand 4 billion pounds. What will they do with it? Assume they just keep it in the bank. Then under fractional reserve banking, the bank will be able to offer more loans at a total principal value a multiple of the 4 billion. Will the bank attempt to offer more loans? If it does, will it have to offer lower interest rates to attract willing (and solvent) borrowers? The questions have no ending. Assume instead that the owners try to spend the 4 billion by purchasing goods from domestic businesses. Is a 4 billion-increased-demand large enough to push prices up (is supply capacity at its limits and stock low) or suppliers will be happy to accommodate, no problem? The questions have no ending. Assume instead that the owners attempt to import goods from another country... My point is that such questions can in principle be answered only after assumptions as to the state of the economy have been clearly spelled out (i.e. only in the context of a model). Moreover, for a specific case study, the relative size of the transaction compared to the economic system matters. How is a 4-billion increase in government debt perceived by economic agents? ...and I haven't even touched and the "burning the profits" strategy proposed in the question (and it wouldn't burn it in any case, it would repay its debt to the central bank, which, granted, is the economic equivalent of destroying money).
