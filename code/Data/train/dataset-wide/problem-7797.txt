The previous answer showed that quantifier rank $\log_2(k) \pm 1$ is sufficient and necessary for expressing "A is a $k$-cycle". This implies a lower bound of at least $\log_2(k)$ quantifiers, but not an upper bound since quantifier rank counts nesting-depth of quantifiers and not the number of quantifiers. However, it is possible to express "A is a $k$-cycle" with $O(\log k)$ quantifiers. Here is an explicit expression: You start saying that every vertex has degree exactly two. These are $4$ quantifiers. Next we need to say that every two vertices $x$ and $y$ of the graph are connected by a path of length at most $k$. Let $P_k(x,y)$ denote this predicate. The naive way to express $P_k(x,y)$ requires $k$ quantifiers. A less naive way could use divide-and-conquer but, if we do it directly without any additional trick, the result would still be $k$ quantifiers. The final solution will be to add a trick to the divide and conquer solution. The divide and conquer solution goes as follows: you quantify the middle vertex $z$ and then recurse on the halfs $x$-$z$ and $z$-$y$ by requiring that both $P_{k/2}(x,z)$ and $P_{k/2}(z,y)$ hold. An easy computation shows that this method produces $k$ quantifiers. To improve and achieve $O(\log k)$ quantifiers we make use of a "reusing trick" that those familiar with computational complexity will recognize from the proof that QBF is PSPACE-complete: you quantify the middle vertex $z$ and then say: for every $u$ and $v$, if $u = x$ and $v = z$, or $u = z$ and $v = y$, then $P_{k/2}(u,v)$. This recursive formula expresses the same as before but now $P_{k/2}$ is used recursively only once. This gives the $O(\log k)$ quantifiers that we want. Finally, in order to complete the formula expressing "A is a $k$-cycle" we need to say that every vertex $x$ is connected by a path of length exactly $k$ to itself. This we can do with $O(\log k)$ quantifiers using the same trick that we used for $P_k$. (Note: all this is much easier to argue if $k$ is an exact power of $2$ but can be made to work for any $k$). 

Suppose I tried to take Hartshorne chapter II and re-do all of it with non-commutative rings rather than commutative rings. Is this possible? Which parts work in the non-commutative setting and which parts don't? Edit: I also welcome any comments/references regarding any reasonable notions whatsoever of "non-commutative algebraic geometry".

I think sigfpe's comment is correct -- the formula $3g-3$ is only true for $g \geq 2$, and however you can "visualize" or understand these $3g-3$ dimensions for $g \geq 2$ probably won't work or help for $g=0,1$. I'm not sure if this will help, but one way (the only way that I know, but there are others) to "visualize" the $6g-6$ dimensions is using the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates. Roughly it works like this: You can take your genus $g \geq 2$ surface and cut it along $3g-3$ circles to get a bunch of pairs of pants ($2g-2$ of them). Then $3g-3$ of the $6g-6$ dimensions come from the lengths of the circles; the remaining $3g-3$ dimensions come from how much we "twist" when we identify the pants along the circles. A key fact which makes this work is that, for each specification of the lengths of the boundary circles, there is a unique pair of pants (unique complex structure). If you google "Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates" I am sure that you will find lots of papers with nice pictures illustrating this, and explaining this in more detail. Anyway, you'll notice that you can't do this for $g=0,1$. A sphere can't be cut into pairs of pants, nor can a torus. 

This is an attempt to give a family of counterexamples, somewhat following Victor Protsak's comment. The basic idea is: let $\phi:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4$ be a generic Langlands parameter. Then I think $\phi^{Sp_4}:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4\subset SO_5$ should be usually generic, while $\phi^{GL_5}:W_F'\rightarrow SO_4\subset SO_5\subset GL_5$ is always non-generic as it factors through $GL_4\subset GL_5$. How do we really find such an $\phi$? I am not familiar with the LLC for $Sp_4$ at all, but there are examples that can work. Here is one: let $p\not=2$, $T$ be a two-dimensional unramified anisotropic torus, and $\chi:T\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^{\times}$ a tamely ramified character that is "in general position." By LLC for tori we get $\phi_{\chi}:W_F'\rightarrow {}^LT$. One can embed ${}^LT\subset W_F\times SO_4\subset W_F\times SO_5$, so that $\phi_{\chi}^{Sp_4}$ is generic; it will be a Langlands parameter corresponding to the depth-zero supercuspidals of DeBacker and Reeder. 

Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve and let $C^{(n)}$ be its $n$th symmetric power. Let $E$ be a $S_n$-equivariant vector bundle over the Cartesian power $C^n$. Suppose that $E$ descends to a vector bundle $\tilde{E}$ over the symmetric power $C^{(n)}$. Then there are two things I can do: 

A simple basic relation is $\lambda_1^2 = 2\lambda_2$. I can derive this as follows: By Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch, we have $ch(\pi_! \omega_\pi) = ch(\mathbb{H})-1 = \pi_\ast ( ch(\omega_\pi) \cdot td(\omega_\pi^\vee))$. By a simple calculation, the degree 3 (if you use Chow groups) (degree 6 if you use cohomology) term of $ch(\omega_\pi) \cdot td(\omega_\pi^\vee)$ is zero. Thus the degree 2 term $ch_2(\mathbb{H})$ of the left hand side is zero. We also have $c_2(\mathbb{H}) = \frac{ch_1(\mathbb{H})^2}{2} - ch_2(\mathbb{H})$, hence we conclude $2c_2(\mathbb{H}) = ch_1(\mathbb{H})^2 = c_1(\mathbb{H})^2$. 

Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over a complete discrete valuation field with perfect residue field (or just a non-arch local field). Let $\mathcal{B}$ be its reduced Bruhat-Tits building, and $d(\cdot,\cdot)$ the distance function on $\mathcal{B}$. I am wondering if the following statement is true: There exists a constant $C$ such that for any compact element $x\in G$ (i.e. $\{x^n|n\in\mathbb{Z}\}$ is contained in a compact subgroup), and any $p_1, p_2\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $x.p_1=p_2$, there exists $p_0\in\mathcal{B}$ with $$x.p_0=p_0,\;d(p_0,p_1)\le C\cdot d(p_1,p_2).$$ What I actually want is have an explicit $C$ in terms of $G$. For example, I'll guess that $C$ can be bounded by a constant multiple of the rank of $G$. E.g. when the rank is $1$ the assertion is true for $C=\frac{1}{2}$. 

Why is omegaC an invertible sheaf? Does it follow from, e.g., Hartshorne III.7.11? Why is some large power of L generated by global sections? How do we know that this power can be chosen to be constant in families? How do we see that L restricted to unstable C' is OC'? 

I am trying to find the precise statement of the correspondence between stable Higgs bundles on a Riemann surface $\Sigma$, (irreducible) solutions to Hitchin's self-duality equations on $\Sigma$, and (irreducible) representations of the fundamental group of $\Sigma$. I am finding it a bit difficult to find a reference containing the precise statement. Mainly I'd like to know the statement for the case of stable $GL(n,\mathbb{C})$ Higgs bundles. But if anyone knows the statement for more general Higgs bundles that would be nice too. Just at the level of say sets and not moduli spaces, I think the statement is that the following 3 things are the same, if I am reading Hitchin's original paper correctly: 

Lusztig defined (in Sec. 5, also Sage) a Springer action of the affine Weyl group on the homology of affine Springer fibers (Iwahori one, i.e. in an affine flag variety). In the regular semisimple unramified case, Goresky, Kottiwtz and MacPherson had a formula (14.4) for this action assuming the homology is pure, for example in the equal valuation case, where they said 

I think the following is true, but haven't came up with a proof myself. Thanks in advance! Let $G$ be a semisimple (to avoid more words) algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$. Write $F=\mathbb{C}((t))$ and $\mathcal{O}=\mathbb{C}[[t]]$. Is it true that a maximal solvable Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}(F)$ that is also a finitely generated $\mathcal{O}$-module must be an Iwahori subalgebra? In other words, is it true that all such Lie subalgebras are conjugate? (feel free to replace $F$ by your favorite non-archimedean local field) 

Semisimple Frobenius manifolds also arise in singularity theory, when studying for instance isolated hypersurface singularities (see Hertling's book Frobenius manifolds and moduli spaces for singularities; the three references above probably also talk about this), or in the physics terminology "Landau-Ginzburg (B-)models". I don't know whether Frobenius manifolds (in particular non-semisimple ones) arise more generally in singularity theory...? In any case, these Frobenius manifolds coming from singularity theory are supposed to be related to those coming from Gromov-Witten theory via mirror symmetry.* Another comment: Quantum cohomology of, for example, $\mathbb{P}^n$ is semisimple. Then perhaps this makes quantum cohomology and GW theory of projective varieties more tractable, because of quantum Lefschetz ... but I don't really know anything about this. But very roughly speaking, I think this is the strategy of Givental in his proof of the "mirror conjecture" of Candelas et. al. regarding the genus 0 GW theory of the quintic 3-fold, though I might be wrong. *Edit: For example, this paper of Etienne Mann seems to prove a mirror theorem relating the quantum cohomology Frobenius manifolds of (weighted) projective spaces and the Frobenius manifolds associated to the mirror Landau-Ginzburg B-models. As Arend mentions, germs of semisimple Frobenius manifolds are specified by a finite set of data, and I think the strategy of Mann's paper is to show that these data coincide for the two Frobenius manifolds. 

(Editted: a "weaker" example about $GL_3$ at the end) If I didn't make a mistake in my computation, then the second question doesn't hold for $G=Sp_4$, as it doesn't hold for any $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Allow me to use $F$ as my p-adic field and $k$ its residue field. Let $V/_F$ be spanned by $e_2,e_1,f_1,f_2$ with the symplectic form $(e_i,f_j)=\delta_{ij}$, $(e_i,e_j)=(f_i,f_j)=0$, so that we identify $G(F)=Sp(V)$. The hyperspecial vertices on the building correspond to self-dual lattices of $V$. Let $T$ be the diagonal torus which acts on $V$ by $(c_1,c_2):e_i\mapsto c_ie_i, f_i\mapsto c_i^{-1}f_i$. Let $\pi\in\mathcal{O}_F$ be a fixed uniformizer. Consider the lattices $$\Lambda_{a,b}=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_2+\pi^{-1} e_1+\pi^{-2}af_1+\pi^{-3}bf_2, e_1+\pi^{-1}f_1+\pi^{-2}(a-1)f_2,f_1-\pi^{-1}f_2,f_2\rangle,$$ where we let $a,b$ runs over a fixed set of representatives of $k$ in $\mathcal{O}_F$. One checks that all $\Lambda_{a,b}$ are in different $T(F)$-orbits by essentially showing that they are in different $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$-orbits. Next one compute the stabilizer of $\Lambda_{a,b}$. What's necessary then is to check the following: Claim. (1) $\text{Stab}_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}(\Lambda_{a,b})\supset T_3=T(1+\pi^3\mathcal{O}_F)$. (2) If $ab+b-a+1\not\in\pi\mathcal{O}_F$, then $\text{Stab}_{T(\mathcal{O}_F)}(\Lambda_{a,b})\subset T_2=T(1+\pi^2\mathcal{O}_F)$. However, there are only $q+3$ ($q=\#k$) subgroups between $T_2$ and $T_3$. In other words, we have $q^2-q+1$ such lattices, but only $q+3$ possible choices for stabilizers for them; an open compact subgroup of $T(F)$ have to correspond to about $O(q)$ orbits. Note. I did some brute force (using Iwasawa decomp.) and it seems that such an assertion holds for $GL_3$ in most or all cases of $GL_3$. However it also seems to me that if one fix a (semisimple) split rank, then it will be difficult for similar assertion to holds for larger $\dim(G)$; in other words, I'd say such an assertion probably only holds for $GL_n$ (and not for any other classical groups or non-split groups), if it does. -- Editted: Here is an example about $GL_3$ where things fail. Let $T$ again be the diagonal torus. Let $a>0$ be any integer. Consider the two lattices in $F^3$ $$\Lambda_a=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_1+\pi^{-a}e_2+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_2,e_3\rangle$$ $$\Lambda_a'=\mathcal{O}_F\langle e_1+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_2+\pi^{-a}e_3,e_3\rangle$$ These two lattices correspond to two hyperspecial vertices which are not in the same $T(\mathcal{O}_F)$-orbit and thus $T(F)$-orbit. But they have the same stabilizer $Z(F)\cdot T(1+\pi^a\mathcal{O}_F)$. This is however a weaker example because in this case a stabilizer correspond to $2$ orbits. It's probably the case that for $GL_3$ every possible stabilizer corresponds to at most $2$ orbits, but I have no good intuition about why it should be true. (Note that the number of orbits with distant $r$ from the apartment no longer have a uniform bound independent of $p$.)
