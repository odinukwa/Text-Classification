This is my attempt at fleshing out the details using the universal property as Scott Carnahan suggested. I think this is correct but I'm not totally sure. Let me know if theres anything off. Let $\mathscr{X} = [X/G]$, $\mathscr{Y} = [Y/H]$ and $\mathscr{P} = [X \times_S Y/G \times H]$. $\mathscr{X}$ is described by the following pseudofunctor: $$ \require{AMScd} \mathscr{X}(U) = \left\{\begin{CD} P @>>> X \\ @VVV \\ U\end{CD}\right\} $$ where $P \to U$ is a $G$-bundle, $P \to X$ is $G$-equivariant, and everything is compatible with the morphisms to $S$. The analogous is true for $\mathscr{Y}$ and $\mathscr{P}$ respectively. The fiber product $\mathscr{X} \times_S\mathscr{Y}$ represents maps to $\mathscr{X}$ and $\mathscr{Y}$ which are equal with the compositions $S$, that is, the pseudofunctor of pairs $$ \left\{\begin{CD} P @>{g}>> X \\ @VVV \\ U\end{CD}, \begin{CD} Q @>{h}>> Y \\ @VVV \\ U\end{CD}\right\} $$ such that $g$ is $G$-equivariant, $h$ is $H$-equivariant and everything is compatible over $S$. By the universal property of fiber products, this pair of diagrams is naturally equivalent to the diagram $$ \begin{CD} P \times_U Q @>{(g,h)}>> X \times_S Y\\ @VVV \\ U \end{CD}. $$ $P \times_U Q \to U$ is a principle $G \times H$ bundle by construction and the map $(g,h)$ is a $G \times H$-equivariant morphism by construction. Therefore, the diagram is an element of $\mathscr{P}(U)$. This defines a fully faithful natural transformation of pseudofunctors $\mathscr{X} \times_S \mathscr{Y} \to \mathscr{P}$. Now, it remains to show that every object in $\mathscr{P}(U)$ naturally comes from such a pair. That is, we must show that every $G \times H$ principle bundle on $U$ with a $G \times H$ equivariant morphism to $X \times_S Y$ is the product of a $G$-bundle and an $H$-bundle with equivariant morphisms to $X$ and $Y$. So suppose we have a diagram $$ \begin{CD} E @>>> X \times_S Y\\ @VVV \\ U \end{CD} (*) $$ in $\mathscr{P}(U)$. $G$ and $H$ are naturally viewed as normal subgroups of $G \times H$. Then from $E$ we get a $G$-principal bundle $E/H$ and an $H$-principal bundle $E/G$. The $G \times H$ equivariant morphism $E \to X \times_S Y$ induces a $G$ equivariant morphism $E/H \to X$ and an $H$ equivariant morphism $E/G \to Y$. These are all compatible with the morphisms to $S$ from naturality of fiber products. Therefore, we get a pair of elements $$ \left\{\begin{CD} E/H @>>> X \\ @VVV \\ U\end{CD}, \begin{CD} E/G @>>> Y \\ @VVV \\ U\end{CD}\right\} $$ in $\mathscr{X} \times_S \mathscr{Y}(U)$. There is a natural morphism of principal bundles $E \to E/H \times_U E/G$ over $U$ compatible with the maps to $X$ and $Y$ by the universal property of fiber products. Since any morphism of principal bundles is an isomorphism (equivalently since $\mathscr{P}$ is a stack so it is fibered in groupoids) then the diagram $(*)$ is naturally isomorphic to $$ \begin{CD} E/H \times_U E/G @>>> X \times_S Y\\ @VVV \\ U \end{CD}. $$ This gives a natural equivalence of categories between $\mathscr{X} \times_S \mathscr{Y}(U)$ and $\mathscr{P}(U)$. Therefore, we get an isomorphism of stacks $\mathscr{X} \times_S \mathscr{Y} \cong \mathscr{P}$ over $S$. 

Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity is defined in the general mutligraded case in this paper of Maclagan and Smith. They give the definition in terms of local cohomology and discuss bounding the regularity so this may be what you are looking for. 

The answer is yes in the case that $X$ is reduced. In fact the following more general fact is true (see this recent preprint): Theorem. Let $X$ be a reduced curve. Then $\sum_n \chi_{mot}(X^{[n]})t^n$ is a rational function where $\chi_{mot}$ is the universal Euler characteristic valued in the Grothendieck ring of varieties $K_0(\mathrm{Var}_\mathbb{C})$. 

There are some special cases where the CSM classes of singular varieties can be computed easily. For example there is Ehler's formula for $c_{SM}(X)$ where $X$ is any complete toric variety. Let $\Sigma$ be the fan of $X$ with torus orbits $B_\sigma$ for $\sigma \in \Sigma$, then the CSM class of $X$ is given by $$ c_{SM}(X) = \sum_{\sigma \in \Sigma}[\overline{B}_\sigma] \in A_*(X) $$ where $\overline{B}_\sigma$ are closures of the torus orbits. Paolo Aluffi has done a lot of work on computing these things. For example (see here) he has constructed a generalization that lives in proChow groups instead of the usual chow groups. The proChow group of a variety $X$ agrees with the Chow group when $X$ is proper and the proCSM class of a not necessarily complete toric variety still satisfies the same formula as above. This also generalizes to other varieties with stratification by smooth locally closed subvarieties but the formula gets more complicated. In another direction, if we have an embedding $i : X \subset M$ where $M$ is smooth, then we can compute $i_*c_{SM}(X)$ in $M$ by the following formula. $$ i_*c_{SM}(X) = c(TM) \cap [M] - \pi_*\left(c(\Omega^1_{\tilde{M}}(log X')^\vee)\cap [\widetilde{M}]\right) \in A_*(M) $$ where $\pi : \widetilde{M} \to M$ is an isomorphism away from $X$ and $X' = \pi^{-1}(X)_{red}$ is an snc divisor. See this paper. When $X$ is itself a hypersurface in $M$ there is a much more computable formula: $$ c_{SM}(X) = c_F(X) + c(TM) \cap \left(\frac{1}{c(\mathcal{O}(X))}\cdot (s(Y,M)^\vee \otimes \mathcal{O}(X))\right) $$ where $c_F$ is the Chern-Fulton class and $s$ is the Segre class and $Y$ is the singular locus of $X$. Each of the pieces of this formula are in general much more computable then $c_{SM}$ itself in the sense that there are algorithms and Macaulay2 codes for doing this. For more on this aspect and especially techniques and examples of these computations, check out this survey. As for your second question, it is true in general that the degree of the zero dimensional piece of $c_{SM}(X)$ is the Euler characteristic, $$ \int c_{SM}(X) = \chi(X). $$ So the answer to your second question is yes. 

This is just a random question I was thinking of. There are lot of cases of things in algebraic geometry unifying and generalizing geometric and arithmetic ideas. For example, the etale fundamental group putting together both Galois theory and covering spaces, so that the etale covers are just field extensions. I was wondering if there was any analagous reason as to why divisors are called divisors in algebraic geometry. Does their name have any relationship to a divisor as in an element that divides another element in arithmetic or ring theory? Does it reduce to something like that in any special case like the fundamental group reducing to the galois group? Is there any relation at all or is does the name divisor mean something totally different and/or is coincidental or random? Edit: To clarify I mean divisor as in formal linear combinations of irreducible subvarieties of codimension 1. 

Let $\mathcal{C}'$ and $\mathcal{D}'$ be categories so that $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{C}'$ and $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathcal{D}'$ are full subcategories. Suppose the forgetful functors $F_{\mathcal{C}}:\mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}'$ and $F_{\mathcal{D}}: \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D}'$ have left adjoints $G_{\mathcal{C}}$ and $G_{\mathcal{D}}$. Then in general does an equivalence of categories between $\mathcal{C}'$ and $\mathcal{D}'$ induce an equivalence of categories between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ by composing with the adjunctions? If this is not true in general are there any criteria to guarantee this? The specific situation this came up in was trying to prove an equivalence of categories between sheaves on two different sites. I didn't want to deal with showing things were sheaves so I wanted to just prove an equivalence between the presheaf categories and say we can sheafify to get an equivalence on the sheaf level. I ended up proving that my functor sent sheaves to sheaves directly but I was still wondering if there was an answer to this question in general. 

I've been trying to read this paper to understand deformations of surface quotient singularities. I'm particularly interested in when one can deform certain cyclic quotient singularities into other cyclic quotient singularities. I've heard that in higher dimensions, isolated quotient singularities are rigid. More precisely, if $X$ is an isolated quotient singularity by a finite group and $\dim X \geq 3$ then the only deformation of $X$ is the trivial one. What is some explanation or intuitive reason for why you can deform quotient surface singularities but you can't deform higher dimensional quotient singularities? 

Here is a straightforward example with $\Delta \neq 0$. I think it can be adapted to give an example without a boundary. Let $X_0 = C \times C'$ be a product of elliptic curves viewed as an elliptic fibration $X_0 \to C$ with a fixed section $S_0$ and fiber $E_0$. Let $\mu : X \to X_0$ be the blowup of the intersection point $p = S_0 \cap E_0$. I'll denote the exceptional divisor by $A$ and the two strict tranforms by $S$ and $E$. Now consider the log canonical pair $(X, \Delta = S + F + E)$ where $F$ is the strict transform of a fiber disjoint from $p$. We have that $K_X \sim_\mathbb{Q} A$ and $$ L = K_X + \Delta = K_X + S + F + E $$ is big, nef and even semiample. $L$ is zero precisely on $E$ so the basepoint free linear series $|mL|$ for $m \gg 0$ induces a log canonical contraction $f : X \to Y$ that contracts $E$ to an elliptic singularity and $Y$ is the log canonical model of $(X, \Delta)$. Now we want to show that $\mathcal{O}_X(mL) = \omega_X(\Delta) \otimes \mathcal{O}_X((m-1)L)$ has nonzero higher cohomology. First note that $f_*\mathcal{O}_X(mL) = \mathcal{O}_Y(m(K_X + f_*\Delta))$ is sufficiently ample on $Y$ so $H^j(f_*\mathcal{O}_X(mL)) = 0$ for $j > 0$. Therefore $$ H^1(X, \mathcal{O}_X(mL)) = H^0(Y, R^1f_*\mathcal{O}_X(mL)) $$ from Leray spectral sequence. Now $R^1f_*\mathcal{O}_X(mL)$ is a skyscraper sheaf at $f(E)$ and we can compute this is nonzero by the theorem on formal functions using: $(1)$ $E$ is an elliptic curve, $(2)$ $mL|_E = \mathcal{O}_E$. Here the restriction of $mL$ to $E$ contributes to the cohomology since $E$ is a log canonical center of the pair. If I understand correctly, this is the only way that KV vanishing can fail for log canonical pairs: $\textbf{Theorem:}$ Let $(X, \Delta)$ be a projective log canonical pair. Let $L$ be a big and nef $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier divisor such that $L$ remains big when restricted to each log canonical center of $(X,\Delta)$. Then $$ H^j(X, \mathcal{O}_X(K_X + \Delta + L)) = 0 $$ for $j > 0$. This is a special cause of Theorem 1.10 in this paper of Fujino. See also Theorem 1.7 in the paper linked in the question. 

I might be interpreting your question wrong, but if not then I believe the answer is yes. This boils down to the fact that a ring is local if and only if the Jacobson radical $J(R)$ is maximal if and only if every element $x \notin J(R)$ is a unit. This characterization of local comes from the fact that the Jacobson radical is the intersection of all maximal left ideals. Then the first if and only if statement is clear and the second follows from the fact that any nonunit is contained in a maximal ideal. Now, for the proof of your statement. Suppose for some $n$, every $J$-matrix in $M_n(R)$ is nonsingular. Then for any $a \notin J(R)$, consider the matrix $A = \text{diag}(a,1,\ldots,1) \in M_n(R)$. By construction, $A$ is a $J$-matrix so $A$ is nonsingular. However, $A$ has an inverse if and only if $a$ is invertible. Thus, any $a \notin J(R)$ is invertible so $J(R)$ is maximal and $R$ is a local ring.
