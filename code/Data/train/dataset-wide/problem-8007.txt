Is the minimal resolution of Kleinian singularities of type $D_k$ (i.e. the minimal resolution of singularities of the action of the binary dihedral group of order $4(k-2)$ on $ C^2$ simply connected? Is there a reference where their topology is described? 

After some time spent on it I now have some understanding of de Rham cohomology and can actually calculate some cohomology groups. However I have now and then encountered many other cohomology theories: compact, harmonic, rational, Cech ... I understand that they all share a similar structure, however it seems to me that the calculation techniques can be quite different: for example homotopy invariance is a key tool to use in de Rham cohomology, but it is not valid in compact cohomology. So, is it that at a higher level of knowledge the similarities between the various theories are such that some experiences in computing cohomology groups in one of them can be easily transferred to the others or is just life hard? I should point out that my aim is certainly not to perform research in this area, but rather to be able to calculate the cohomology groups of some non-trivial space (but nothing terribly complicated) when the need arises. 

In general one has the following bound on your integral $$ \frac{2}{3}L^{3/2}+ \frac{L^{1/2}}{\sqrt{2}}\ln \left(\frac{1+2K}{2+2(K-L)}\right)\leq \mathrm{integral}\leq \frac{2}{3}L^{3/2}+ L^{1/2} \ln\left(\frac{3+4K}{1+4(K-L)}\right) $$ Let us make change of variables $x=Ly$. Then we want to estimate from above $$ L^{3/2}\int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{y \left(1+ \frac{1}{K-Ly}\right)} - \sqrt{y}\; dy $$ We have $$ \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{y}\left(\frac{\sqrt{K-Ly+1}-\sqrt{K-Ly}}{\sqrt{K-Ly}} \right)\; dy = \frac{1}{K}\times \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{y}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(L/K)y}(\sqrt{1-(L/K)y+(1/K)}+\sqrt{1-(L/K)y})} \right)\; dy \leq \frac{1}{K} \times \int_{0}^{1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(L/K)y}\sqrt{1-(L/K)y+(1/K)}} \right)\; dy = \frac{1}{L}\ln\left( \frac{1+2K+2\sqrt{K}\sqrt{K+1}}{1+2(K-L)+2\sqrt{K-L}\sqrt{K-L+1}}\right)\leq \frac{1}{L}\ln\left(\frac{3+4K}{1+4(K-L)}\right) $$ Update (lower bound): $$ \int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{y}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(L/K)y}(\sqrt{1-(L/K)y+(1/K)}+\sqrt{1-(L/K)y})} \right)\; dy \geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\int_{1/2}^{1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-(L/K)y}\sqrt{1-(L/K)y+(1/K)}} \right)\; dy = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{K}{L}\int_{1-\frac{L}{K}}^{1-\frac{L}{2K}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{z}\sqrt{z+\frac{1}{K}}}dz $$ Now let us use the fact that $$ \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{z^{2}+\frac{z}{K}}} = \ln \left(1+ 2Kz +2\sqrt{Kz}\sqrt{Kz+1}\right) - \ln K, \quad z>0 $$ which can be checked by direct differentiation (but I will skip it), then we can continuo our chain of inequalities $$ =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{K}{L}\,\ln \frac{1+2(K-\frac{L}{2}) +2\sqrt{K-\frac{L}{2}}\sqrt{K-\frac{L}{2}+1}}{1+2(K-L) +2\sqrt{K-L}\sqrt{K-L+1}}\geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{K}{L}\,\ln \frac{1+4(K-\frac{L}{2})}{2+2(K-L)}\geq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{K}{L}\,\ln \frac{1+2K}{2+2(K-L)} $$ which is pretty much the same. 

Maybe take a tunnel number 1, 2-component link with distinct unknotting tunnels. For each unknotting tunnel, form the graph which is the union of the link with the unknotting tunnel & then zip it to make a theta graph. Work of Cho & McCullough should tell you the answer to your question in this setting. Take two (knotted) genus two handlebodies which are not isotopic in $\mathbb{R}^3$ but which have homeomorphic exteriors $X_1$ and $X_2$. The unzips correspond to attaching 2-handles to the boundaries of $X_1$ and $X_2$. If you could find the right sort of 2-handle additions to guarantee that the resulting links are isotopic (which seems like it might be hard, but not totally out of the question to me) you would have your counterexamples. The graphs produced would have the stronger property of not being even neighborhood isotopy equivalent. (I think it should follow from the various proofs of the "band sum theorem" (eg. by Scharlemann/Gabai) that this approach won't work if you try to create a split link with your unzip.) 

Let $r(t)$ be a real trigonometric polynomial of degree $n>1$. Assume it has zero at $t=0$ of multiplicity $k>0$. What can be said about the lower bound of the constant $c(k,n)$ such that $$ \max_{t \in \mathbb{R}}|r'| \geq c(k,n) \max_{t \in \mathbb{R}}|r|. $$ For example, 

Let $A$ be $k\times n$ matrix i.e., $A=(a_{1},\ldots, a_{n})$ where $a_{j} \in \mathbb{R}^{k}$, $rank(A)=k$ and $1\leq k \leq n$. Let $q=(q_{1},\ldots, q_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be such that $0<q_{j}\leq 1$. For which $A$ and $q$ there exists symmetric matrix $C$ such that \begin{align*} A\left\{ \frac{q_{j}}{\langle Ca_{j},a_{j}\rangle}\right\}A^{T}C=I_{k\times k} \end{align*} so that $\langle Ca_{j},a_{j}\rangle >0$ (here $\langle\cdot, \cdot\rangle$ denotes scalar product in Euclidian space), and $\left\{ \frac{q_{j}}{\langle Ca_{j},a_{j}\rangle}\right\}$ denotes $n\times n$ diagonal matrix. 

In some cases, Wick rotation of a metric, formally consisting in substituting a coordinate with i times the coordinate itself, allows one to construct a Riemannian manifold starting from a Lorentzian one. The most known example, is Minkowski spacetime, which becomes Euclidean 4-space. Other example are Schwarzschild and Taub-NUT. I would be interested in knowing which conditions are needed to ensure that by performing a Wick rotation on a Lorentzian manifold one obtains a Riemannian manifold and what problems can arise in the process - i.e. why one cannot always obtain a Riemannian manifold by Wick rotating a Lorentzian one. I am also interested in the reverse process, i.e. under which conditions one can obtain a Lorentzian manifold starting from a Riemannian one. Are there any properties of the manifold which are preserved by the process? EDIT: Thanks for the comments and answers so far. Indeed, I do not have a definition of what is meant by a Wick rotation for general manifolds - perhaps I should have asked how and if can such a notion be defined in a general context. As far as I know twistors theory makes use of complexified manifolds, is anyone aware of whether such a theory has anything to say about the problem? 

This comment was too long. For martingales of the form $X_{t} = \int_{0}^{t}f(s,\omega)dB_{s}$ where $B_{t}$ is the standard Brownian motion, $f(s, \omega)$ is non-anticipating function such that $\int_{0}^{\infty}f^{2}(s, \omega)ds <\infty$ a.s. (I guess they are called $L^{2}$ integrable continuous martingales) one can obtain the bound of order $\sqrt{p}$ for large $p$. This is due to Burgess Davis, (see Section 3) of the reference. The result essentially follows from the Brownian case with arbitrary $L^p$ integrable stopping times. However, for discrete time martingales, this is not true, and the best possible bound is of order $p$ for large $p$, for example, see paper of G. Wang, Remark 2. On the other hand, there are very special ``conditionally symmetric'' discrete martingales for which one can obtain the bound of order $\sqrt{p}$. And it looks like continuous $L^{2}$ integrable martingales in this sense are similar to conditionally symmetric ones. Wang, Gang, Sharp inequalities for the conditional square function of a martingale, Ann. Probab. 19, No.4, 1679-1688 (1991). ZBL0744.60046.

This is really more of a comment, but here goes: The question you ask is "dual" to this question: Suppose you have two theta graphs $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ such that for each edge $e_1$ of $\theta_1$, there is an edge $e_2$ of $\theta_2$ such that the knots $\theta_1 - e_1$ and $\theta_2 - e_2$ are isotopic. Must $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ be isotopic? The answer to the dual question is "no" as seen by an unknotted theta graph and Kinoshita's graph. In terms of suggestions for a places to look for counterexamples: 

One way of motivating the derivative definition of curl (or rather scalar curl in 2D) is to prove a "Mean Value Theorem" for Rectangles. Suppose that $\mathbf{F} = (M, 0)$ is a vector field defined on the rectangle $R = [a,b] \times [c,d]$. Write the integral $\frac{1}{\operatorname{area}(R)}\int_{\partial R} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s}$ as $\frac{-1}{b-a}\int_a^b \frac{M(t,d) - M(t,c)}{d-c}$. Apply the MVT for integrals and then the MVT for derivatives to conclude that there is a point $\mathbf{x} \in R$ such that $$\frac{1}{\operatorname{area}(R)}\int_{\partial R} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s}= -\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}(\mathbf{x}).$$ Do the same for vector fields of the form $(0, N)$. Then if $\mathbf{F}$ is C$^1$ and if $R_n$ is a sequence of rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides converging to a point $\mathbf{a}$, then we obtain: $$\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{\operatorname{area}(R_n)}\int_{\partial R_n} \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial y}(\mathbf{a}) - \frac{\partial M}{\partial x}(\mathbf{a}).$$ This is enough to explain what curl is measuring, without using Green's theorem. Some students and I in a recent paper use this result to give a rather more intuitive proof of Green's theorem than those usually found in vector calc texts. See $URL$ 

Remark: One can weaken the assumption "diagonal entries of $Y$ are zero" to "$\mathrm{Tr}(Y)=0$" but then the conclusion would be $$ \mathbb{E} |x^{T}Yx| \geq \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\mathbb{E} |x^{T}Y^{0}x|^{2}}? $$ where $Y^{0}$ is obtained from $Y$ by removing diagonal entries. Indeed, this follows from the identity $x^{T}Yx=x^{T}Y^{0}x$. 

Given $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ let $H_{\lambda}(x)$ be the solution of the Hermite differential equation: $$ \frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} H_{\lambda}(x)-x\frac{d}{dx}H_{\lambda}(x)+\lambda H_{\lambda}(x)=0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R} $$ such that $H_{\lambda}(x) = x^{\lambda}+o(x^{\lambda})$ when $x \to +\infty$. If $\lambda=0,1,2,..$ is a positive integer then $H_{\lambda}$ is the probabilists' Hermite polynomial of degree $\lambda$. It is known that the Hermite polynomials do satisfy Turán's inequality, i.e., $$ H_{\lambda}^{2}-H_{\lambda-1}H_{\lambda+1}\geq 0 \quad \text{for}\quad \lambda \in \mathbb{N} \quad \text{and} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}\quad (*) $$ I suspect that (*) still holds for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$. Does anybody know any references about this fact? I believe this should be something known. UPDATE The statement is true when $x \geq L_{\lambda}$ where $L_{\lambda}$ denotes the leftmost zero of $H_{\lambda}$. And it follows in the same way as in $URL$ page 392. The same recurrence relations hold and power growth at infinity makes the argument to work. Question is closed! 

If $X$ is a compact oriented surface in a 4-dimensional oriented manifold $M$, then the self-intersection number $X^2$ of $X$ is given by the integral over $X$ of the Euler class of the normal bundle. In the case of $CP^1$ embedded in $CP^2$, the normal bundle is isomorphic to the Hopf bundle, therefore $X^2$ can be obtained calculating the first Chern number of the Hopf fibration (or equivalently the Euler number of its realization). It is possible to have circle bundles on $CP^1$ with higher Chern number by taking the quotient of the total space of the Hopf fibration by the action generated by $(z^1,z^2)\mapsto(z^1 \exp(i 2 \pi/k), z^2 \exp(i 2\pi/k ))$. Are these bundles the normal bundles of some embedding of $CP^1$ in a 4-dimensional manifold? If yes, is it possible to describe the embedding explicitly? Is there a deeper relation between the Hopf bundle and the normal bundle of $CP^1$ embedded in $CP^2$ or do they just happen to be the same? 

Consider the first order nonlinear ODE problem: $$ y'(x)=\frac{1+ay(x)x}{1+by(x)x}, \quad x>0 $$ where $a, b>0$ are some constants. I would like to know if these kind of equations were studied somewhere else (i.e., existence of global solutions, uniqueness etc). Any references will be helpful. Remarks: Mathematica does not give me anything. I have tried to use Maple and it shows me that $y$ is a solution of an equation involving some Whittaker functions but I am not sure about this. If $a=b$ then $y=x+C$. If $a=1, b=2$ then one can take $y(x) = \frac{1}{2}\left(x-\frac{1}{x} \right)$ 

Let me first say that my background is theoretical physics so I find it hard to look at some of the mathematical literature. The kind of problem I am interested in is the following one. Consider a 4-dimensional smooth, simply connected orientable manifold M and suppose A and B are immersed surfaces. Denote with $A\#B$ the connected sum of A and B (since M is simply connected I think there is only one way of doing this). Denote with $A\cdot B $ the intersection number of A and B in M. Is it true that the self-intersection number of $A\#B $ in M is given by $(A \# B) \cdot (A \# B) = A \cdot A + 2 A \cdot B + B \cdot B $? If A, B are 2-spheres, looking at Freedman and Quinn, Topology of 4-Manifolds page 24 I would think so, but I am not sure I am understanding the book well. What could be said, perhaps making additional assumptions, if A and B are surfaces of more complicated topology?
