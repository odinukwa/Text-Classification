Newton polytopes and the polynomials they support We will use the standard notion $\mathbf{x}^{\mathbf{a}} := \prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{a_i}$ to represent monomials in a multivariate (Laurent) polynomial ring. The Newton polytope of a polynomial is the convex hull of its exponent vectors. We say that a polytope $P$ supports a polynomial $p$ if $P$ is the Newton polytope of $p$. Example 1: The polytope $\mathrm{conv} \{[0,0]^\top\}$ supports all constant polynomials over any bivariate polynomial ring. More generally, a lattice point $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ supports every polynomial of the form $c_\mathbf{a}\mathbf{x}^\mathbf{a}$ where $c_\mathbf{a}$ is an element of an arbitrary ring. Example 2: The Newton polytopes of the polynomials \begin{align} p &= 2 + 3x^2 - 2y + \frac{1}{2}xy \in \mathbb{Q}[x,y,z] \text{ and }\\ q &= -1 + 8x - x^2 + 5y + xy \in \mathbb{Z}_9[x,y,z] \end{align} both have vertices $V = \{[0,0,0]^\top, [2,0,0]^\top, [0,1,0]^\top, [1,1,0]^\top\}$ and hence coincide. In general we have the following: Fix a (convex) lattice polytope $P \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Then $P$ is the Newton polytope of a polynomial $p$ if and only if $p$ is of the form $\sum_{\mathbf{a} \in P \cap \mathbb{Z}^d} c_\mathbf{a}\mathbf{x}^\mathbf{a}$ such that $c_\mathbf{a} \neq 0$ whenever $\mathbf{a}$ is a vertex of $P$. A note on standard simplices There are two geometric objects typically associated with the term standard $(d-1)$-dimensional simplex: one is the full-dimensional polytope in $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ whose vertices consist of the origin together with the $d-1$ standard unit vectors; the other is a codimension one polytope in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose vertices are the $d$ standard unit vectors. Since there is a natural map between these two polytopes that preserves typically relevant polyhedral data, the choice of which definition to use is usually motivated by the problem at hand. In the OP the probability vectors are naturally associated to points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose coordinates sum to $1$, so taking the second view of the standard simplex (as suggested in the OP) seems more natural. The dimension of the product of simplices First we collect some basic facts. The dimension of a polytope is the dimension of its affine span. In particular, the dimension of (the convex hull of) a point is zero. The dimension of a product of polytopes is just the sum of dimensions of the factors. Now, in the computation of the dimension of $\Delta^{(i)}$ in the OP the dimension of $\{0\}$ is $0$ and not $1$. So the dimension of $\Delta^{(i)}$ is $\delta -d_i + 1$, as expected. 

Regarding the "general framework" part of your question, if we work in a general category with some notion of "dimension" or "size" and replace "injective" with "monic" then we can rephrase this condition as: "Every proper subobject of an object is of strictly smaller dimension than the original object." Given that the "dimensions" are, say, non-negative integers, this implies a descending chain condition on subobjects. In turn, we can (sort of) recover our notion of dimension by taking the length of the longest descending chain of subobjects. Looking at this condition, it seems reasonable to assume it might be called a "noetherian category," and in fact Googling turns up such a definition on nlab (modulo some technical set theoretic condition). So we can say that the categories of finite sets, finite dimensional vector spaces, and finite dimensional compact manifolds are all noetherian. In fact, we can say more: namely, that they are precisely the subcategories of noetherian objects in the categories of sets, vector spaces, and compact manifolds, respectively. 

Presumably there's also a condition that the groups "vary continuously" in some sense, just like a vector bundle isn't any disjoint union of arbitrary vector spaces indexed by elements of a space. The paper seems to give an example in example 1.3. 

Chevalley's theorem: any algebraic group is the extension of a linear algebraic group by an abelian variety. 

For general background on torsors, John Baez has a nice writeup in This Week's Finds which you can find with Google. (I'm writing on mobile.) 

More on when the metric bases of a graph are matroidal can be found in these two papers: BC2011 and B2013. Another example Finally let's return to Example 1 of this answer to the previous question. In that example we have $M = \{0,1,2,3\}$ and $d$ given by $$d(x,y) = \begin{cases} 2 \text{ if } x,y \neq 0 \\ 2 + \frac{1}{y} \text{ if } x = 0. \end{cases}$$ The metric generating sets of $(M,d)$ consist of all subsets of $\{0,1,2,3\}$ other than the singletons $\{i\}$, where $i \in \{1,2,3\}$. In particular, $\{0\}$ is a metric generating set of cardinality one. So the metric dimension of $(M,d)$ is one and $\{0\}$ is the only metric basis. It follows that the set of metric bases $\mathcal{B}(M,d)$ is matroidal with the corresponding matroid on four elements being isomorphic to the uniform matroid $U_{1,1}$ together with three loops. 

Webster himself does not know if this result has been published elsewhere. Two excellent resources for triangulations of oriented matroids are Triangulations: Structures for Algorithms and Applications in the realizable case and Triangulations of Oriented Matroids in the general case. Neither of these sources discuss partitions of triangulations of oriented matroids. A simplicial complex $\Delta$ is partitionable if there is a function $\phi : F \to \Delta$ on the facets of $\Delta$ such that the set of intervals $\{[\phi(f), f]~|~f \in F\} $ is a partition of the faces of $\Delta$. 

Let $U$ be the uniform matroid of rank $k$ on $n$. Since $U$ is orientable one can consider the Lawrence oriented matroid $\Lambda(U)$ associated with any orientation of $U$ (the Lawrence construction doesn't care about which orientation you take). Then $M(n,k)$ is precisely the underlying unoriented matroid $\underline{\Lambda(U)}$ of $\Lambda(U)$. Also, the dual matroid $M^*(n,k)$ is a symplectic matroid, which explains why the group $B_n$ acts on the primal. 

I think the following meets your setup. Let $\mathbb K = \mathbb Z_2$ with the "absolute value" $|0|=0, |1|=1$ (this is non-Archimedean). See $URL$ Set $V = \mathbb Z_2^I$ for some index set $I$, with the trivial norm $\|0\|=0$ and $\|x\|=1$ for all other vectors $x$. This satisfies the usual rules, with $\|kx\| = |k|\|x\|$ for $k\in\mathbb K, x\in V$. Clearly $V$ actually have the discrete metric, and so is complete. Now, the closed unit ball is all of $V$, and not compact if $I$ is infinite. BUT, I could instead define $\|x\|=2$ for $x\not=0$. Still we have a norm. Now the closed unit ball is $\{0\}$; and so is compact. All non-trivial linear maps have norm $1$. To me, this seems like a very, very silly example, which perhaps shows that the original question needs tweaking with a bit... If you start with an Archimedean absolute value, then really you have a subfield of $\mathbb C$ or $\mathbb R$ (which must contain $\mathbb Q$). By continuity, I then think you can turn $V$ into a $\mathbb R$ vector space, with a "norm" in the usual sense. Then if $V$ has a compact unit ball, it must be finite dimensional (over $\mathbb R$). So your example of $\mathbb R^2$ over $\mathbb Q$ is in a sense all that can happen. 

X is infinite-dimensional, so we can find $(e_n)$ a linearly independent sequence in X; let X' be the span. By rescaling, we can assume that $\|e_n\|=1$ for each n. Define $T:X'\rightarrow \mathbb R$ (or $\mathbb C$, or embed into Y if you wish) by $T(e_n) = n$ for each n. Clearly T is unbounded on X'. For each finite sum $x=\sum_{n=1}^N x_n e_n$ and $\epsilon>0$, we can choose $a\in\mathbb R$ and $m$ very large with $|a|<\epsilon$ and $T(x) = -am$. Set $y=x+ae_m$, so $T(y)=T(x)+am=0$ and also $\|x-y\| = |a|<\epsilon$. Let D' be the collection of all such $y$; as such $x$ exhaust X', we certainly have that D' is dense in X'. Use Zorn to extend $E=\{e_n\}$ to $E'$ a basis of X. Extend T to X by setting $T(x)=0$ for $x\in E' \setminus E$. Let $D = D' + \text{span}(E'\setminus E)$, so D is dense in X, and T is bounded on D; actually T vanishes on D. Now, D is certainly not a subspace: if you want that as well, I don't know!
