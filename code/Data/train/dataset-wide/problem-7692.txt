So unless your base field has characteristic 2, and your division algebra is a purely inseparable extension of the base field, your division algebra has to be finite dimensional. 

(I accidentally posted this as an answer to a different question - gulp! Not paying attention) From this article in the Notices of the AMS, we have an excerpt from Paul Halmos: 

Edit: McLarty now (1 December 2011) says that for derived functor cohomology over a Noetherian scheme, with coefficients in an arbitrary sheaf of modules (on the Zariski site), only requires second-order arithmetic. In particular, coherent cohomology falls under this umbrella. This also brings such results into the realm of reverse mathematics, which deals with hierarchies of theories of second-order arithmetic. 

This would be a map $$ K(\mathbb{Z}/2,2) \times_{K(\mathbb{Z}/4,4)} K(\mathbb{Z},4) \to K(\mathbb{Z}/2,6) $$ as $\pi_5(BSO(3)) \simeq \mathbb{Z}/2$. An obvious option would be (reduction mod 2 then) cup product. But there may be some other cohomology operation floating around. 

If you are more interested in differential geometry, then the category of all finite-dimensional manifolds (of your preferred flavour) is already essentially small. This is due to the Whitney embedding theorem. 

The construction you describe yields, for any category, an $n$-fold category (nLab), a concept originally introduced by Ehresmann. This can be defined iteratively using the language of internal categories, namely a 1-fold category is just a category, a 2-fold category (or double category, as they have been called) is a category internal to the category of 1-fold categories, and more generally, an $(n+1)$-fold category is a category internal to the category of $n$-fold categories. There is a functor $Cat \to nFoldCat$ sending a category $C$ to the construction $C^{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{n}}$ you describe. Note however, that an $n$-fold category arising in this way comes with a whole bunch of structure inherited from the inclusions $\stackrel{\rightarrow}{n} \hookrightarrow \stackrel{\rightarrow}{m}$ for $n\lt m$. Concretely, a double category is given by vertical and horizontal arrows, both of which share the same objects, and squares, which have a vertical source and target (which are horizontal arrows) and a horizontal source and target (which are vertical arrows). There are definitely double categories which do not arise as $C^{\stackrel{\rightarrow}{2}}$ for some category $C$. For example, one can take a strict 2-category $K$ and send it to the double category with horizontal and vertical arrows just the arrows of $K$, and the squares are squares in $K$ which commute up to a specified 2-arrow of $K$. It is a somewhat remarkable result that $n$-fold groupoids (a strict structure) can actually model homotopy $n$-types, which is one form of the homotopy hypothesis. Ronnie Brown is fond of recounting the amazement of Grothendieck when he learned this, as at the time he was thinking about defining weak $n$-groupoids to do this job (this is during the correspondence surrounding the writing of the manuscript Pursuing Stacks). As you point out, one can take $n \to \infty$, and have $\infty$-fold categories. There is a result of Brown and Higgins that strict $\infty$-categories (also called strict $\omega$-categories) are precisely $\infty$-fold categories satisfying some (rather strong) properties. Note however that modern approaches to higher categories don't use $n$-fold categories on their own, but do pop up in much more complicated guise as $n$-fold complete Segal spaces, but I think if you are starting out with higher categories, you may want to get some material under your belt before going there. 

The fundamental bigroupoid $\Pi_2(X)$ of a space $X$ was independently described by Hardie, Kamps and Kieboom (paywall) and Stevenson (arXiv) around the year 2000. HKK cite Baez-Dolan's seminal HDA0, but the idea there is just very roughly sketched, and cited Grothendieck's Pursuing Stacks for inspiration. The idea goes back to a letter in February 1975 from Grothendieck to Breen describing the ideas later expanded in Pursuing Stacks: 

EDIT: removed cruft from this question. Recall that extra degeneracies for an augmented simplicial set $X$ are maps $s_0\colon X_n \to X_{n+1}$ for $n=-1,0,1,2,\ldots$ which satisfy the usual simplicial identities with respect to the existing $d_i$, $s_i$. This definition clearly works for simplicial objects in pretty much an arbitrary category. A simplicial set, augmented by $X_{-1} = \ast$, with extra degeneracies is contractible. In fact, given enough structure on an ambient category $C$, one can sensibly talk about homotopy of simplicial objects in $C$ (for example, one can say when $sC$ is a category with cofibrant objects, and has a notion of homotopy of maps). [EDIT: By this I mean there is some sort of model structure around relative to which we can talk about homotopy] So my question is this: is it reasonable to think of simplicial objects in $C$ with extra degeneracies as being contractible for any category $C$ with terminal object? Certainly, ignoring size issues, we can think of such things as being contractible after we embed them in the category of simplicial sets in $Pre(C)$, if not some smaller (co)completion category. Secondarily, can I get away with saying a simplicial object with extra degeneracies "is a contractible simplicial object?" 

The (finite dimensional) Morse complex obtained from $f_\epsilon$ clearly is not a subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex. If there is in question one no finite dimensional subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex that computes the cohomology of $M$, then the Morse complex of $f_\epsilon$ may be viewed as a finite dimensional substitute. However, it maybe rather arbitrary, since it depends on the choice of $f_i$. Also, the dimensions of this complex maybe quite large, for instance, $f_i$ may have more critical points than the sum of the Betti numbers of $C_i$. That is, $f_i$ may not be a perfect Morse function. If the Morse complex of $f_\epsilon$ is a substitute, then how to choose a good one? Or are there other ways to construct a finite dimensional "Morse-Bott" complex that computes the cohomology of $M$? 

J. Bismut proved the asymptotic formula for the heat kernel of the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$ on a manifold $M$ in one of his well-known books. Later, in his paper on the index theorem, Bismut said that the result can be extended immediately to the heat equation semi-group for Hodge-Kodaira Laplacian or the Dirac Laplacian, since these (operators) are subordinated to the heat equation semi-group for $\Delta$. My question is: what is subordination or the subordination process in probability? If there is such subordination, how can one see that the result can be extended immediately? The proof of the asymptotic formula by Bismut in his book on Large Deviation is not easy to follow. Also Bismut mentioned that Malliavin has already used the subordination in his paper on vanishing theorem. 

Is there a finite dimensional subcomplex of the Morse-Bott complex that also computes the cohomology of $M$? 

Novikov complex is an extension of Morse theory to (closed) Morse 1-form $\omega$, which is not necessarily exact. Suppose for simplicity, $\omega$ is in the integer cohomology class and the universal covering is infinite cyclic. Then $\omega$ can be lifted to the universal cover $\hat M$, i.e., $\pi^\star \omega=d\hat f$, for some Morse function $\hat f$ on $\hat M$. The Morse 1-form $\omega$ generalizes the Morse function and the zeros of $\omega$ take the place of the critical points of a Morse function. Indices of the zeros (or critical points) of $\omega$ can be defined similarly and we have the stable and unstable manifolds of a critical point. The incidence number between a pair of critical points respectively of index $k$ and $k-1$ of $\omega$ can be defined for a Morse-Smale pair $(\omega, g)$, where $g$ is a Riemann metric on $M$. One can lift the stable and unstable manifolds to $\hat M$ and define the corresponding incidence number in $\hat M$ similarly. One can also define the Novikov complex. My question is: $\hat M$ is not compact and the unstable manifold (or the descending disc) of a critical point in $\hat M$ in general goes infinitely downwards. Also, for fixed $x$ in $\hat M$, it is possible that the incidence numbers between the critical points $x$ of index $k$ and $y$ of index $k-1$ in $\hat M$ are non-zero for infinitely many $y$. These are different from Morse theory on compact manifolds. Can someone give a (simple) example of an unstable manifold in $\hat M$ going infinitely downwards for some Morse 1-form? Maybe also an example of infinite number of non-zero incidence numbers? I am sorry that I pose the question rather imprecisely. 

The above paper also gave a chain map from the Morse-Bott complex to a certain Morse complex pertaining to a Morse function $f_\epsilon$ obtained from a small perturbation of $f$. The chain map also induces isomorphism on cohomology (see p.147). The method is as follows: Let $C_i$ be all the critical submanifolds of $f$, $i=1, ...n$. Let $f_i$ be a Morse function on $C_i$. $f_i$ will have critical points on $C_i$. Let $\rho_i$ be some bump function that has support and value $1$ in some small neighbourhood of $C_i$. Define for $\epsilon$ small enough, $$f_\epsilon=f+\epsilon\sum\rho_i{{\pi_i}^{-1}}(f_i)$$ Then $f_\epsilon$ is a Morse function on $M$. (Here $\pi_i$ is projection of the normal bundle to $C_i$.) Here is my second question: 

Let $M$ be a manifold equipped with a pair of surjective submersions $N_1 \stackrel{p_1}{\leftarrow} M \stackrel{p_2}{\rightarrow} N_2$ where $dim N_1 = dim N_2 = n$. Then we can find, for any point $m\in M$, a chart $U_1$ around $p_1(m)$ and a local section $s\colon U_1 \to M$ of $p_1$ such that $s(p_1(m)) = m$ and $s(U_1)$ is transverse to the fibres of $p_2$. In thinking about this we can clearly reduce to the case $N_1 = N_2 = \mathbb{R}^n$. We can even restrict attention to $M = \mathbb{R}^m$, and then it becomes a problem of linear algebra, namely finding a basis on $\mathbb{R}^m$ for which the submersions are both projections onto $n$ coordinates (we already know this separately). I suspect that for infinite-dimensional vector spaces, and Frechet spaces in particular (really anything above Hilbert spaces in the usual hierarchy) this sort of result will not hold, and so for Frechet manifolds one cannot construct the analogous local section. In more detail, I'm fairly sure that given a diagram of Frechet spaces $$V_1 \stackrel{pr_1}{\leftarrow} V_1 \times F_1 \simeq W_1 \simeq V_2 \times F_2 \stackrel{pr_1}{\to} V_2$$ where $V_1$ is known to be isomorphic to $V_2$, one cannot in general find a (nonlinear?) map $F\colon V_1 \to V_2\times F_2$ (which is a section, and passes through the origin) such that $pr_1\circ F\colon V_1 \to V_2$ is injective an isomorphism. However, I'd like to see a counterexample (or, if I'm wrong, a proof that we can do it!). (EDIT: the map might need be be non-linear in this case because the definition of submersions doesn't use tangent spaces like in the finite-dimensional case. But linear would be good.) VERSION 2: well it turns out that I have, in addition to the $V_i$s being isomorphic, I have $F_1$ isomorphic to $F_2$. Kudos to Andrew for guessing this would be the case for the application I have in mind. 

Edit: I forgot something that is in PS, and that is the theory of localisers and modelisers, Grothendieck's conception of homotopy theory which you mention, which is covered in the work of Cisinski. 

My thought is that this may be a cover in some generalised sense. Maps from ind-schemes to schemes aren't so common, though that I know how to find how they work or what they do. There are some notes by Gaitsgory that don't help me at all. 

and to quote from later in the paper, where he discusses ways to prove the existence of larger and larger sets, 

Thus they are considering the quotient of the above disjoint union by a relation 'factors through'. That is, for a fixed $X$, there is a set $\{L_\alpha\}_{\alpha\in I}$ of big intervals such that every $f\colon L\to X$ for an arbitrary big interval $L$ factors through some $f_\alpha\colon L_\alpha \to X$, and then $f \sim f_\alpha$. That this isn't a problem is resolved by some variant of Scott's trick, which allows for taking quotients of proper classes, or by arguing directly that the above disjoint union should be replaced by $$ \coprod_{L_\alpha\in I} Top_\ast(L_\alpha,X). $$ In the event that one really has a proper class, then the fact that there is a group structure (class function giving multiplication etc) on that class means that it is a group, just not a set-sized group. Some people (e.g. Conway) would call this a Group, to distinguish it; category theorists might call it a 'large group', if using the terminology of 'small' and 'large' to distinguish set-theoretic size issues. 

There is a book on a more general approach to Galois theory by Borceux and Janelidze (called, imaginatively, 'Galois theories' Google books). A bit more concrete is 'Galois Theory in Symmetric Monoidal Categories' by Janelidze and Street, which uses a Galois theoretic approach to Tannaka duality (a very Grothendieckian study). Marta Bunge has a bunch of stuff on topoi and Galois-type theories, for example 'Galois Groupoids and Covering Morphisms in Topos Theory', 'Constructive Theory of Galois Toposes' (joint with Eduardo Dubuc) and a bunch of others. 

I [EDIT: almost] would follow the suggestion you made in your comment. [EDIT: below the line was my original answer, which is wrong, as pointed out by Karol in the comments. Here is an answer which is less functorial, but I hope more correct.]
