Better explanation: The universe can be thought of as space containing a variety of quantum fields. A quantum field might be best thought of as something that has a value at every point in space. Put together a bunch of these fields and you can describe particles, particle interaction, and all the matter and energy in a given region of space - in fact, in the whole universe! Picture a region of space with absolutely nothing in it. Nothing. (I'm ignoring vacuum energy, even though I really should discuss it) That's a true vacuum. Remove all the fields, particles, and other interesting stuff from our universe and that's what you'll get. Nothing. The false vacuum scenario happens if there isn't actually "nothing" but "something". If our "vacuum" has some extra energy that it shouldn't (again, I'm not talking about normal vacuum energy). In other words, there's something where there should be nothing. In this end-of-the-universe scenario, the universe goes from having this something to having nothing - from a false vacuum to a true vacuum. The region of space actually having nothing starts at a certain region and expands outward at the speed of light. That's what the scientists were talking about. 

1 Flares also are visible in other wavelengths, but I mention X-rays here because Sagittarius A* is typically much less luminous in X-rays. 

I can't help you much there, but I can give you a starter. The density $\rho$ of a circumstellar disk at a distance $r$ (as given by Michael Woolfson in On the Origin of Planets) is $$\rho (r)=C \exp \left[-\frac{(r-r_{\text{peak}})^2}{2 \sigma ^2} \right]$$ where $\sigma$ is one standard deviation and $r_{\text{peak}}$ is the peak density, and $C$ is a constant. As promised, here are some more, set forth by Woolfson. The disk decays over time; its density at time $t$ is approximated by $$\rho_t=\rho e^{- \gamma t}$$ where $\gamma$ is a decay constant. If you've taken certain math course, you've probably seen this equation many times before, just in with $\rho=y$ and $\gamma=k$. Another equation - really, a couple equations - deal with accretion by a small dust particle in a circumstellar disk. The variables involved are: $m$ (mass of the particle), $t$ (time), $s$ (the radius of the particle), $\rho_s$ (the density of the particle), $\rho$ (the density of the disk), $f$ (the fraction of the medium that is dust), $T$ (the temperature), and $k$ (Boltzmann's constant, not be confused with the Stefan-Boltzmann constant). The relevant pair of equations are: $$\frac{dm}{dt}=4 \pi s^2 \rho_s \frac{ds}{dt}$$ $$\frac{ds}{dt}=\frac{3f \rho}{4} \left( \frac{kT}{4 \pi \rho_s^3} \right)^{1/2}s^{-3/2}$$ Using these, you can find the size and mass of a given dust particle at any given time. 

Giant Molecular Cloud forms. A large region of gas and dust, essentially a dense version of the interstellar medium, coalesces into an interstellar cloud. GMCs can be tens or hundreds of light-years across, enough to give birth to many stars. Within the GMC, some regions will be slightly denser than others. A portion of the cloud collapses. A certain region of the GMC collapses, generally due to an outside disturbance. The most commonly cited cause is a supernova shockwave that compresses portions of the GMC, although close passes between galaxies have been known to incite star formation. My favorite example is the Cartwheel galaxy. The region heats up. There is quite a lot of matter pressing in on what has now become a protostar, and so it heats up. Eventually, conditions become such that hydrogen fusion is possible. The protostar, now a pre-main-sequence star, begins to shine. A protoplanetary disk forms. At this point, the star dominates this region of the GMC. Matter nearby is pulled towards it by the force of gravity, and a circumstellar disk forms. It may be composed of gas and dust. Eventually, small grains of dust collide and form bigger grains. Planetesimals form, then protoplanets, and finally planets. 

Though it is only acknowledged in the original paper, the vertical axes for the three different ring regions have been shifted upward different amounts to fit all three on the same graph. After $a=1$, there's a deviation from the law, and then a steep dropoff at about $a=3$. Obviously, particles larger than this exist, and they certainly play an important role in ring structure, but they're relatively rare. Obviously, the trends show that smaller particles are much more common, and thus while there are indeed particles larger than pebbles - some as big as boulders, perhaps, or bigger - they are certainly few in number. Most particles are extremely small, smaller than pebbles. This data covers observations from ring semi-major axes of $\sim$ 75,000 km to $\sim$ 135,000 km - a fairly big spread, covering most of the rings and ending near the Roche Division. The paper doesn't have one single graph of particle number density of a given size at a given semi-major axis, but it does have several subdivided plots (Fig. 15.1 and 15.2) of optical depth as a function of distance from the center of Saturn, which should give you some helpful data on total number density, if you want to make some basic assumptions about mean particle radius. This data is a bit newer, from Cassini, but the Voyager 1 data is just as helpful. 

The ESA states it pretty clearly (although their figure of 855.2 nm is incorrect; it should be 866.2 nm): 

As with Nu Scorpii CD, AR Cassiopeia CD and FG orbit AR Cassiopeiae AB on a timescale of hundreds of thousands of years. The key thing to note about these high-multiplicity multiple-star systems is that their components are often binary systems themselves. In other words, you don't have a case where there's one or two central stars, with the rest independently orbiting them, or where you have a bunch of stars independently orbiting the same point. It's much stabler to create a few tight binaries and then set them in motion - much like a normal triple-star system, except each component is actually two stars. 

An gravitational field extending infinitely (eventually) in all directions means that one object should always have an influence on another. But the gravitational influence of one object can sort of be "blocked" by another object if its field in one spot is strong enough compared to the other. For example, we still feel the force of Mars' gravity, but, to us, it is largely overwhelmed by that of the Earth. We can show this easily using Newtonian gravity. Newton's law of universal gravitation is formulated $$F=G\frac{m_1m_2}{r_{12}^2}$$ where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the two objects - we'll say $m_1$ is the mass of a human, $m_h$, and $m_2$ is the mass of Earth, $m_E$. A human on Earth's surface is roughly $6,371 \text { km}$ from it's center, or $6,371,000 \text { meters}$. Mars, on the other hand, is, at its closest, $0.3814 \text { AU}$ from Earth - or roughly $57,210,000 \text { km}$, or $57,210,000,000 \text { meters}$. Care to do the math? Well, what with this distance being squared ($r^2$), you can tell at a glance that the force from Mars is many orders of magnitude less than the force from Earth. 

It might seem like the way to figure this out would be to test the composition of micrometeorites and see what objects this matches up with. This, however, is not a viable technique, as Genge et al. (2008) explains: 

I'm going to build off of chris's original comment. I haven't had a response from him during the 24 hours since I asked the question, and there doesn't appear to have been any activity from him recently (Note: don't confuse him with another user who goes by Chris), so I might as well expand upon what he said. Gravitational waves do appear to be what you're looking for. They are emitted by systems with varying quadrupole moments (see $URL$ and $URL$ for more information); commonly cited examples are binary neutron stars. In fact, one such binary, the Hulse-Taylor binary, was the first discovered system to emit gravitational waves. Gravitational waves carry energy away from the system, at a rate of $$\frac{dE}{dt}=-\frac{32}{5}\frac{G^4}{c^5}\frac{(m_1m_2)^2(m_1+m_2)}{r^5}$$ where $E$ is eneryg, $t$ is time, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the objects in the system, $r$ is the distance between them, and $G$ and $c$ are the constants, the universal gravitational constant and the speed of light. I invite you to do the calculations for a given system, if you please. I can assure you that it's one of the easier calculations in general relativity! This release of energy causes the orbits of the two neutron stars to gradually decay, and it is thought that eventually the two will merge. The answer boils down to this: Yes, gravitational waves can carry [angular] momentum, just like many other types of waves. They also have frequency, amplitude, wavelength, and speed, just like the "normal" waves we are familiar with. I hope this helps. 

The options the authors suggest rest mainly on experimental biases as opposed to theoretical possibilities. Something I was confused about when I read your question was the assumption that hot Jupiters migrate mainly due to planet-planet scattering. Levison et al. argue that warm Jupiters (i.e. giant planets with semi-major axes of about 1 AU) are more likely to have migrated via planet-planet scattering, because it provides a stopping mechanism via damping, assuming the planetesimal number density scales appropriately. This happens when the energy needed to move planetesimals from their orbits is greater than the energy lost from the change in the planet's orbit. Given that planetesimals cannot survive long in orbits less than about twice the stellar radius, warm Jupiters reach semi-major axes no lower than 0.03 to 0.1 AU (see Murray et al. (1998)). Hot Jupiters, on the other hand, may be driven largely by Type II gas disk migration, where giant planets create a gap in a protoplanetary disk that subsequently brings in material; this then brings the planet closer to the star, eventually leading to a hot Jupiter. Here's a visualization, from Planet Hunters: 

Wikipedia reports the age of HD 140283 as the figure you cited, 14.46±0.8 billion years. Now look at the reference it refers to. This is the paper by Bond et al that presents measurements of some characteristics of the star and the subsequent calculations, as well as a lengthy section on where the error came from (800 million years is, after all, quite a lot - even in Astronomy!). The paper describes an approach to determining ages of stars without all that tedious mucking around with globular clusters. It suggests determining "ages of extreme Population II subgiants in the solar neighborhood based on direct trigonometric parallaxes, combined with state-of-the-art theoretical isochrones appropriate to the detailed composition of each star." In short, the idea is to test stars to see if there ages are consistent with the calculated age of the universe (13.77±0.06 billion years - note the much smaller uncertainty). The paper cites some previous estimates of the star's age - ~14 billion years and 13.5±1.5 billion years. It's worth noting this because the authors appear to pride themselves on how they tried to reduce the error of their measurements. The team next measured the star's parallax, also attempting to reduce error. With that in hand, as well as measurements of temperature and visual magnitude, they used stellar evolution models to determine its age. They also compensated for extinction from their measurements. The authors list the error from parallax, photometry, and extinction as 310 million years. The measurements then (page 11) list the age "implied" by the models and measurements to be 14.46 billion years. Where is the extra 490-million year-uncertainty? Take a look at Figure 1, near the end. It is due to a variety of factors, the largest of which is the uncertainty of the "initial oxygen abundance" - although more properly the uncertainty in the ratio of oxygen to hydrogen. It does come down to what David H said - the error measurements due comply with a universal age of 13.77 billion years. I would note, though, that the uncertainty in the measurement of the age of HD 140283 is much greater (800 million years) than the uncertainty of the age of the universe (37 million years). If the uncertainty due to the oxygen/hydrogen ratio could be eliminated, a more accurate age could be calculated, but until this error is addressed (preferably by another team), I think it's safe to say that it's more likely that the measurements for HD 140283 are off than that the measurements for the universe, and so what could have been a paradox is somewhat resolved. TL;DR - There's a heck of a lot of error in the age of HD 140283, which fits reasonably with current models of the age of the universe, and I would trust the measurements of the age of the universe much more than the measurements of the age of this star, especially because the method used here is not widely used.
