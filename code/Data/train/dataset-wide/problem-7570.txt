Let $Q$ be a manifold, and let $X_{EL}$ be a second order vector-field on $TQ$ derived from the Euler-Lagrange equation, $$ \frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q} } \right) - \frac{ \partial L}{\partial q}=0,$$ for some Lagrangian $L:TQ \to \mathbb{R}$. Then for any $\alpha \neq 0$ and any $\beta \in \mathbb{R}$ we can observe that the Lagrangian $L' = \alpha L + \beta$ yields the same vector-field $X_{EL}$. So the isotropy group (acting on the space of Lagrangians) which leaves the Euler-Lagrange equatiosn unchanged appears to include $( \mathbb{R}\backslash \{0\} , \cdot) \ltimes (\mathbb{R},+)$. Is this the entire group? If you prefer, I'd be happy to hear the answer to the same question posed on the Hamiltonian side (i.e. what is the group of transformations of Hamiltonians which leave Hamiltonian vector-fields unchanged) 

The Koopman operator is bracket preserving with respect to the canonical Poisson bracket on $C^{\infty}(M)$. Formally, this implies the dual operator (the Frobenius-Perron operator) is a Poisson automorphism with respect to the Lie-Poisson structure on $\bigwedge^{2n}(M)$. 

Imagine if your computer program performed a Newton iteration on a non-complete space. The answer that pops out could be ``random'', as Newton iteration produces a Cauchy sequences, and will simply stop at your error tolerance without having converged. 

Picard's Big Theorem says that if a function $f(z)$ has an isolated essential singularity at a point $w$, then in every neighborhood of $w$, $f(z)$ hits every complex number infinitely many times, with perhaps at most one exception. Is there a version of Picard's theorem that goes something like this? Let $V$ be an open disc (finite radius) such that $f(z)$ is holomorphic on $V - \lbrace w \rbrace$, and has an essential singularity at $w$. Let $0 \leq \theta < \phi < 2\pi$, and define $Cone(w,V,\theta,\phi)$ to be $V \cap \lbrace w + re^{i\varphi} \mid r > 0, \theta < \varphi < \phi \rbrace$. Think of this as a "pizza slice" of the disc $V$. Is it true that there exists an $\alpha$ such that $f(z) = \alpha$ for infinitely many $z\in Cone(w,V,\theta,\phi)$? 

Consider arbitrary unit vectors $w,x,y,z \in \mathbb{C}^d$. Is there an explicit formula for what this average is? $$ \int \mathrm{Tr}( \psi \psi^* \, \, w x^* \,\, \psi \psi^* \,\, y z^*) d\psi $$ where the average is over a Haar-random unit vector $\psi \in \mathbb{C}^d$. Here, $\psi \psi^*$ is the rank-one matrix formed by the outer product of $\psi$ with itself. I'm looking for a formula that relates this average to inner products between $w, x, y, ,z$, for example. A related question I'm wondering about is what the expected value of the following inner product is: suppose you pick a Haar-random vector $\psi$, followed by a Haar-random vector $\psi^\perp$ that's orthogonal to $\psi$, and then look at $\langle \psi, x \rangle \langle y, \psi^\perp \rangle$. Thanks! 

Just as a side-note. The proposition does not imply that every symplectomorphism of $T^*M$ is a cotangent lift of a diffeomorphism on $M$. As a counter example, let $\sigma$ be a non-zero closed one-form on $M$ and consider the map $F(x,p) = (x,p + \sigma(x))$. Notes that $F$ is not the cotangent lift of any diffeomorphism on $M$. Also $F^*d \theta = d(F^*\theta) = d( \sigma^H + \theta) = d\sigma^H + d\theta = d\theta$ where $\sigma^H$ is the one-form on $T^*M$ obtained by horizontal lift. Needless to say, if $\sigma$ is closed, then so is $\sigma^H$. Thus $F$ preserves the canonical symplectic form $d\theta$. 

Here is a recent example which I enjoyed. Joris Vankerschaver and Melvin Leok studied point vortices on the sphere (A Novel Formulation of Point Vortex Dynamics on the Sphere: Geometrical and Numerical Aspects). This may have applications in geophysical fluid dynamics where conservation of circulation plays a role. In anycase, the symplectic manifold of concern is $S^2$ with the volume form. The non-exactedness of this symplectic manifold provides a problem when one desires to construct a variational integrator (as the nature of variational principles in such spaces is tricky). They ultimately invokes the Hopf fibration $\pi: {\rm SU}(2) \to S^2$ to pull-back the dynamics to ${\rm SU}(2)$ which allows one to use do everything on a closed symplectic manifold. 

Here's my question: given two base points $b$ and $b'$ of $f$, we've performed the Hensel lifting procedure to obtain the Hensel factors $\{ g^{(b)}_i \}$ and $\{ g^{(b')}_i \}$ (lifted to the same level). Since $F$ is algebraically closed, there are the same numbers of Hensel factors over $b$ as there are over $b'$. Is there any relation between $g^{(b)}_i$ and $g^{(b')}_i$ that's meaningful? Can we say that $g^{(b)}_i(X - b) = g^{(b')}_i(X - b')$? That is, are Hensel roots preserved across change of base points? Thank you! 

EQP is the class of problems solvable deterministically using a quantum computer in polynomial time - that seems to me to be a good analogue to P, whereas BQP is the quantum analogue of BPP. It doesn't seem like much is known about EQP! Just like BPP is not known to be contained in NP, is it known whether EQP \subseteq BQP \subseteq QMA? Is there a corresponding "Derandomization" of BQP into EQP? What about the relationship of EQP and P? 

As David Roberts said (and you seem to already know), left vs right is just convention. In the same way that Riemannian geometry literature was influenced by the role it played in general relativity, perhaps the literature on principal bundles was influenced by the role they played in particle physics. In particular, Yang-Mills mills theory, the actions are on the right [Bleecker, D. ``Gauge theory and variational principles'' (1985) ] 

Building upon Peter's answer, An Atiyah algebroid, or transitive Lie algebroid is one answer to your question. 

I hope this helps. For two projections $p_1$ and $p_2$, if there exists such an $\eta$ then $\eta( p_1(S_Y) ) = \eta( p_2( S_Y) )$ for all measurable sets $S_Y \subset Y$. Upon setting $S_1 = p_1(S_Y)$ for an arbitrary $S_Y \subset Y$ we see that $\eta$ must satisfy $\eta( S_1) = \eta( p_2 \circ p_1^{-1}(S_1) )$ for any measure able set $S_1 \subset X$. In otherwords $(p_2 \circ p_1^{-1})^* \eta = \eta$. So we see that the answer to the question is yes if $(p_2 \circ p_1^{-1})^*$ has fixed points. For $n$ projections we need to check $(p_i \circ p_j^{-1})^*$ for $i,j = 1,\dots,n$. This is for a given fixed $\mu$ on $Y$. If we want an $\eta$ for every $\mu$ my guess is that this happens if and only if $(p_i \circ p_j^{-1})^*$ is the identity. However, this would mean that $p_i = p_j$ for all $i,j$. In the case presented here we find $p_3 \circ p_1^{-1}(x,y) = (x,G)$ while $p_1 \circ p_2^{-1}(x,y) = (G,y)$. The first calculation tells us that $\eta$ must be independent of the second component in $G \times G$ while the second calculation tells us that $\eta$ must be independent of the first component of $G \times G$. This $\eta$ must be very restricted, to say the least, and this restricts the class of possible $\mu$'s.
