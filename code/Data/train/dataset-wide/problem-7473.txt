I believe that anyone who can answer this question knows the terminology, but $\beta\omega$ is the Čech-Stone compactification of the integers and a point $p$ is a weak P-point in a space $X$ iff it is not in the closure of any countable subset of $X-\{p\}$. I admit to lacking intuition with $\beta\omega$ and maybe this question has a trivial answer, apologies if it is the case. My motivation is the following. I want to find a countably compact space $X$ and a surjective map $f:X\to[0,1]$ such that $f(C)\not=[0,1]$ if $C\subset X$ is compact. There might be a simple example that escaped me, but if the question in the title has a positive answer, taking $X$ to be $\beta\omega$ minus its weak P-points yields such a space: -It is countably compact because $\beta\omega$ is compact, hence any countable subset has a cluster point which cannot be a weak P-point, -It maps onto $[0,1]$ because we may map $\omega$ onto the rational numbers in $[0,1]$ and extend the function to all of $\beta\omega$. The image of $X$ is countably compact, hence compact in $[0,1]$ and is thus all of $[0,1]$. -If $f(E)=[0,1]$ with $E\subset X$, $E$ has cardinality $\mathfrak{c}$ and its closure non-compact. But maybe I am trying to kill a mosquito with an atomic bomb and a much simpler example exists. 

But I don't know whether the converse holds as well. A priori, it might be the case that $AC(Z)$ and $AC(\{n\})$ for each $n\in\omega$ do hold, but $AC(\omega)$ does not. I hoped I'd grasp sufficiently quickly how permutation models work to be able to settle this, but I haven't for now, and since I won't have much time in the following weeks to investigate further, I decided to post the answer as it is. Do not hesitate to edit it if I missed something simple. 

Consider the point $x=\langle \omega_1,\omega\rangle$ in the Tychonov plank $(\omega_1 + 1)\times(\omega + 1)$. Then there is essentially only one sequence (of length $\omega$) converging to it, namely $x_n=\langle \omega_1,n\rangle$ for $n\in\omega$. Indeed, any other sequence converging to $x$ is eventually contained in $\{x_n:n\in\omega\}$. (For simplicity, the sequences are assumed not to contain $x$.) My question is: does this property (or any similar one) has a standard name ? 

I believe the "complete feather", a non-hausdorff $1$-manifold due to Haefliger and Reeb, is such an example. It is a simple generalization of Gabriel C. Drummond-Cole example of the interval with two endpoints. Actually, we discuss it in our small elementary paper with A. Gabard (sorry for the self-promotion). This space is $\Delta$-generated, if I am not mistaken. Say that a point is locally strongly contractible if each point has a neighborhood which strongly deformation retracts to a point. (The retraction needs to be defined only in the neighborhood, not the whole space.) David Gauld proved long ago the following theorem: If a space $X$ is locally strongly contractible, contractible to a point $p$, and completely regular at $p$, then $X$ strongly deformation retracts to $p$. The complete feather shows that you cannot drop entirely the "completely regular" assumption. 

The question I am going to ask is really to satisfy my curiosity, as I am not at all an expert of the subject and do not plan to really work on it. Hence, if you think the question is not suitable for MO, I'll delete it. I did some browsing but could not locate any answer, but maybe I missed something simple. Take ZF as a basis. If $Z\subset\omega$, denote by $AC(Z)$ the axiom of choice for sets of (finite) sets whose cardinality is in $Z$: $AC(Z)$: If $x\not=\emptyset$ and for all $y\in x$ we have $|y|\in Z$, then there is a choice function on $x$. Thus $AC(\omega)$ is the axiom of choice for sets of finite sets, and $AC(\{n\})$ (for $n\in\omega$) the axiom of choice for sets of $n$-elements sets. The implications between $AC(Z)$ for finite $Z$ and $AC(\{n\})$ have apparently been well studied in the first years of the 70s (and before by Tarski and Mostowski), I don't know to which point the question is entirely solved. Just to give an idea, some (classical ?) implications I found in the literature are: \begin{align*}AC(\{2\})&\Leftrightarrow AC(\{4\}),\\ AC(\{3,7\})&\Rightarrow AC(\{9\}),\\ AC(\{2,3,7\})&\Rightarrow AC(\{14\}). \end{align*} It is easy to see that $AC(\{n\cdot m\})\Rightarrow AC(\{n\})$: Given $x$ containing $n$-element sets, there is a choice function on $\{y\times m\,:\,y\in x\}$ by $AC(\{n\cdot m\})$, the projection on the first factor gives a choice function on $x$. Thus, if $Z$ contains all the multiples of some given $n$, then $AC(Z)\Leftrightarrow AC(\omega)$. My question is whether there is some kind of converse: 

André's answer is great, but this example might be simpler. Let $\mathbb{L}_+=\omega_1\times[0,1)-\langle 0,0\rangle$ be the longray, and set $\Omega=\{\langle \alpha, 0\rangle\,:\,\alpha\in\omega_1\}\subset\mathbb{L}_+$. Take $M=\mathbb{L}_+\times(-1,1) - \Omega\times\{0\}$. Then $M$ is a $2$-manifold since $\Omega$ is closed in $\mathbb{L}_+$. But the two closed sets $A=\cup_{\alpha\in\omega_1}\{\langle\alpha,0\rangle\}\times(0,1)$ and $B=(\mathbb{L}_+-\Omega)\times\{0\}$ cannot be separated by disjoint open sets. 

If I did not miss something, the following is a simple example of such space. The idea is to have a space such that $\beta X$ is equal to the one point compactification of $X$. Consider the Tychonov plank $T=(\omega_1+1)\times(\omega+1)$, and $X$ be its subspace $T - \{\langle \omega_1,\omega\rangle\}$. Then $T=\beta X$, as well known, see for instance $URL$ Take the usual closed subset $Y=\{\langle \omega_1,y\rangle :y\in\omega\}\cup\{\langle x,\omega\rangle :x\in\omega_1\}$, then $\overline{Y}^{\beta X}-Y$ is the singleton $\{\langle \omega_1,\omega\rangle\}$. Thus the function $f$ which has value $0$ on one part of $Y$ and $1$ on the other cannot be continuously extended to any subset of $\bar{Y}^{\beta X}$ properly containing $Y$. 

(S) is the property: There is no decomposition of $n$ in a sum of primes $n=p_1+\dots +p_s$ such that $p_i > m$ for all $i=1,\dots,s$. Thus, $AC(\{1,\dots,m\})$ implies $AC(\{1,\dots,p-1\})$, where $p$ is the smallest prime bigger than $m$. It follows that "$\forall p$ prime $AC(\{p\})$" implies "$\forall n\in\omega AC(\{n\})$". (The proof of Jech's result is actually very similar to what Will wrote.) For the forward implication, we may use the following result, found in Truss' paper: 

Since Gerry Myerson asked for a summary after my reading of Truss' paper (kindly suggested by Andreas Blass), I post this answer after having accepted Will Sawin's, which basically gave the solution, although I am not completely convinced that it is really complete (see below for more on this). Although I did not notice it when I posted the original question, there are actually two closely related but slightly different versions that one may ask: 

Let $\mathfrak{S}_n$ be the permutation group of $n$. $\mathsf{D}(n,Z)$ denotes the following property: for each subgroup $G\subset\mathfrak{S}_n$ without fixed point, there is a subgroup $H\subset G$ and proper subgroups $K_1,\dots, K_r$ of $H$ such that $\sum|H:K_i|\in Z$. It is then easy to see that if no multiple of some prime $p$ is in $Z$, then $\mathsf{D}(p,Z)$ does not hold: let $G\subset\mathfrak{S}_n$ be the cyclic group of order $p$, the only proper subgroup of $G$ is the trivial group, hence $\sum|H:K_i|$ is a multiple of $p$. Truss uses permutation models to prove Theorem 3, I did not have the time to really read it carefully (and he actually proves something more general, as his model of $\neg AC(\{n\})$ satisfies $AC$ for ordered sets of finite sets, for instance). As for Question 2, Theorem 3 actually proves: 

EDIT: I tried to improve the presentation. I hope that it is a bit more readable now. I think that the following construction gives a consistent counter-example. It uses the combinatorial principle $\diamondsuit$, which implies CH (the continuum hypothesis) and is independant from ZFC. I'll work with ordinals, and since $\alpha<\omega_1$ (for instance) may be seen either as a point or as a an initial segment in $ \omega_1 $, I'll use the interval notation when I refer to the latter. Start with a circle bundle over $\omega_1$, that is, a space $X$ with a continous map $\pi$ onto $\omega_1$, such that the fiber over each point $\pi^{-1}(\{\alpha\})$ is a circle. (Of course, $\omega_1$ is endowed with the order topology.) Say that a subset of $X$ is bounded if it is contained in $\pi^{-1}([0,\alpha])$ for some $\alpha<\omega_1$, and unbounded otherwise. Nyikos showed in his article "The theory of non-metrizable manifolds" in the Handbook of set theoretic topology (Example 6.17) that using $\diamondsuit$, we can construct a circle bundle over $\omega_1$ with the following properties: 1) The underlying set of $X$ is $\omega_1\times\mathbb{S}^1$, but the topology is not the product topology. 2) $\pi^{-1}([0,\alpha])$ is homeomorphic to $[0,\alpha]\times\mathbb{S}^1$ with the usual product topology for any $\alpha<\omega_1$. In particular, $X$ is locally compact. We may fix an homeomorphism $\psi_\alpha:\pi^{-1}([0,\alpha])\to [0,\alpha]\times\mathbb{S}^1$ for each $\alpha<\omega_1$. 3) If $E\subset X$ is closed, then either $E$ is bounded, or $E$ contains $\pi^{-1}(C)$ for $C$ a closed and unbounded subset of $\omega_1$. In particular, in the latter case $E$ is not totally disconnected since it contains copies all the fibers (which are circles) above the member of $C$. (Note: Actually, Nyikos builds a bundle over the long ray ${\mathbb{L}}_+$ which is even a surface, but we take only the restriction to $\omega_1$.) Now, define a circle bundle $\pi':Y\to\omega_{\omega_1}$ as follows. The underlying set of $Y$ is $\omega_{\omega_1}\times\mathbb{S}^1$. $X$ will be included in $Y$ as the union of the fibers above the $\omega_\alpha$, for $\alpha<\omega_1$. The topology "between" $\omega_\alpha$ and $\omega_{\alpha+1}$ is the usual product topology. That is, if $\omega_\alpha < \gamma < \omega_{\alpha+1}$, given $x\in\mathbb{S}^1$, take $\beta,\beta'$ with $\omega_\alpha\le\beta<\gamma<\beta'< \omega_{\alpha+1}$ and an open $O\subset\mathbb{S}^1$ containing $x$, then $(\beta,\beta')\times O$ is a neighborhood of $\langle\gamma,x\rangle$. We now define the neighborhoods of $\langle\omega_{\alpha},x\rangle$. In $X$, choose a neighborhood $U$ of $\langle \alpha,x\rangle$, and denote by $U^\beta$ the intersection $U\cap \pi^{-1}(\{\beta\})$. Set $V^{\omega_\beta}=U^\beta$, and if $\omega_\beta<\gamma<\omega_{\beta+1}$, set $V^{\gamma}=U^{\beta+1}$. That is: $V^\gamma$ is equal to the intersection of $U$ with the fiber over $\beta+1$. Then a neighborhood of $\langle\omega_{\alpha},x\rangle$ is given by the union of $\{\gamma\}\times V^{\gamma}$ for all $\gamma$ greater than some $\gamma'$. Then $Y$ has the following properties: 2') For any $\alpha<\omega_{\omega_1}$, $(\pi')^{-1}([0,\alpha])$ is homeomorphic to $[0,\alpha]\times\mathbb{S}^1$ with the usual product topology (and thus $Y$ is locally compact). To see this, define the homeomorphism $\phi:(\pi')^{-1}([0,\alpha])\to [0,\alpha]\times\mathbb{S}^1$ by setting $\phi(\langle\omega_{\alpha},x\rangle)=\psi(\langle\alpha,x\rangle)$, and for $\omega_\alpha<\gamma<\omega_{\alpha+1}$, set $\phi(\langle\gamma,x\rangle)=\psi(\langle\alpha+1,x\rangle)$, where $\psi$ is defined in 2) above. 3') As 3) with $\omega_{\omega_1}$ rather than $\omega_1$. Now, a bounded subset of $Y$ is contained in some $[0,\alpha]\times\mathbb{S}^1$, and has thus cardinality $\max\{|\alpha|,\omega_1\}<\omega_{\omega_1}$ (since $2^\omega=\omega_1$ by CH). Taking the one-point compactification yields a compact space such that a closed set of cardinality $\omega_{\omega_1}$ cannot be totally disconnected. I hope that I did not miss something. I don't know whether another construction can be done in ZFC, but this particular one needs at least something more than ZFC+CH, because Nyikos space $X$ would have to contain a copy of $\omega_1$ (which is impossible, and thus the space does not exist) in a model of ZFC+CH due to Eisworth and Nyikos.
