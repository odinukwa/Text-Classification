The fact that $H^1_p$ is a direct summand in $H^1$ is obvious if we consider just those objects as $\mathbb{Q}$-vector space (since a sub vector space always has a suplementary). What you mean probably is "why is $H^1_p$ a direct summand of $H^1$ as a module over the Hecke operators?". Then the answer is still yes, but a proof is needed. The idea is that one can identify $H^1_p$, as a Hecke-module, to the sum of two copies of the space of cuspidal modular forms of weight $k+2$, while $H^1/H^1_p$ may be identified with the space of Eisenstein series of the same weight. Since the systems of Hecke-eigenvalues of Eisenstein series are not the same as the system of eigenvalues of cuspidal form (for example because the eigenvalues of $T_l$ goes to infinity as $l^{k+1}$ for an Eisenstein series, and in $O(l^{k/2+1})$ for a cusp form (Hecke estimates), $H^1_p$ has a unique Hecke-stable supplementary $H^1_e$ in $H^1$. Moreoever, this provides an interpretation of $H^1_e$ as Eisenstein series, which have a geometric interpretation as sections of certain sheaves of $X(N)$ satisfying some conditions at infinity. All the above is known as the theory of the "Eichler-Shimura isomorphism". A complete reference for this is the book by Hida called "Elementary theory of L-function and Eisenstein series". 

The argument that allows you to show that an elliptic curves defined as you say is a group scheme, and even a commutative one is the construction of a functorial and natural isomorphism $E(T) \rightarrow Pic_{E/S}^0(T)$ for every $S$-scheme $T$. This allows to see the functor $T \mapsto E(T)$ as a funtor in group, and since this functor is representable by $E$, this gives a structure of group scheme on $E$, which is the one you are looking for. Essentially this map is defined as follows: one attached to a point in $E(T)$, that is a $T$-section of $E_T$, the invertible sheaf of divisor this section minus the trivial section $e_T$ (obtained by base change from the section $e$ which is part of the definition). To prove that this map is an isomorphism, one essentially reduces, using base change theorems for direct image in coherent cohomology, to the case of a field, where it becomes a consequence of Riemann-Roch. Note that by definition, the trivial section $e_T$ is send to to the trivial sheaf, so that $e$ is the neutral section of the group scheme structure on $E$, as desired. Of course there are many details to deal with to make this argument a complete one, but this is done with great care in the beginning of the (unique) book by Katz and Mazur. 

There are two questions, the one where you ask whether it is possible to find a $p$ in an arithmetic sequence s.t. $f|T_p \equiv 2 f$ and the one s.t. $f | T_p \equiv \alpha f$ for some $\alpha$ in the residue field. 

If your friend knows well rings and ideals, he has certainly encountered quotient like $I/J$, hasn't he? What are they for him? sets? abelian groups? This point of view is wanting. You can formulate basic and very useful results, such as (for $A$ local, noetherian): if $I/mI$ has a set of $n$ generators, so has the ideal $I$ (Nakayama), only if you can see $I/J$ as a module... 

As as been rightly said, Nash defined a concept of equilibrium for zero-sum games with $n$ players, and proved the existence (but no uniqueness of course) of such, while Von Neumann and Morgenstern did that only for $n=2$ (or larger $n$ but with very strong hypotheses on the game that reduces the problem to a game with $n=2$ players). But it is important to note than while doing so, Nash also defines a concept of equilibrium for non-zero sum games with $n$ players, for such a game is equivalent to a zero sum game with $n+1$ players: just add one new player, the "bank", whose gain/loss is defined as the negative of the sum of the gains of each other players. That being said, the real-world meaning of the concept of Nash equilibrium is very tricky, and it is far from clear if/when that concept is the right one to analyze a game situation, while in the case $n=2$, the Von Neumann/Morgenstern concept is much more obviously the only right one. 

PS: here is the proof of the trivial upper bound: $AS(p,a) \leq \frac{1}{p-1} \sqrt{(p-1) \sum_{\chi} |S(\chi,a)|^2}$ by Cauchy-Schwarz, and $\sum_\chi |S(\chi,a)|^2$ can be expanded as $\sum_{\chi,i,j} \chi(i) \overline{\chi(j)}=\sum_{i,j} \sum_\chi \chi(ij^{-1})$ where $i,j$ run from $1$ to $a$ and $ij^{-1}$ is computed modulo $p$; then the sum over $\chi$ is $0$ unless $i=j$ which happens $a$ times, and it this case it is $p-1$, so $\sum_\chi |S(\chi,a)|^2=(p-1)a$, hence $AS(a,p)\leq \sqrt{a}$. 

I have already given some thoughts to the question, but I am not able to solve it. Surely one of the ideas involved should be the following: even assuming only GRH for the Artin's $L$-function, not Artins conjecture, we know that $L(\rho,s)$ has no pole except maybe on the critical line, for by the theorem of Brauer, $L(\rho,s)$ is a quotient of products of Hecke $L$-functions, and those functions have no poles on the critical strip except parhaps at $s=1$ by a deep result of Hecke, and no zeros either, under GRH, except maybe on the critical line. Moreover, one also knows using the same argument of Brauer that $L(\rho,s)$ is meromorphic function of order $1$, that is quotient of two entire functions of order $1$, and therefore that $L(\rho,s)$ has a nice Weierstrass product formula (like (5.23)). Then the natural way to go is to try to follow the proof given by Iwaniec and Kowalski under GRH and Artin, using the above remarks to avoid using Artin. I see several issues with that method, the most important being the following: a crucial step in the method is the estimate of the number of zeros $N(T)$ (with their positive multiplicty) of $L(\rho,s)$ on the critical segment between $s = 1/2 -iT $ and $s=1/2 + iT$ - see Theorem 5.8. This estimate is obtained by integrating $L'/L$ on a suitable rectangle intersecting the critical line on that segment. Yet in the presence of poles this method will not count the number $N(T)$ of zeros, but the difference $N(T)-P(T)$ where $P(T)$ is the number of poles (with their multiplicty) on the same segment. So even a good estimate for $L'/L$ hence of $N(T)-P(T)$ will not prevent $N(T)$ and $P(T)$ to be arbitrary large. Then, when one computes $\psi(\rho,x)$ by some explicit formula (such as (5.53)), both zeros and poles contribute and if these are too many, that is if $N(T)+P(T)$ is too large, the precise estimate (1) will be completely ruined. 

This is not exactly an answer to the question as asked, but I was recently confronted to the same problem: how to define, for a general audience, a modular form for the full modular group in a way which is both correct and quick? Here is a solution I used: A modular form of weight $k$ (and level 1) is a formal series $f(q)=\sum_{n \geq 0} a_n q^n$, converging on the open unit disc, such that, in terms of the variable $z$ defined by $q=e^{2 i \pi z}$, $f$ satisfies $f(-1/z)=z^k f(z)$. It is short and allows you to talk without further steps of the $q$-expansion of $f$, and avoid even mentioning the full modular group $Sl_2(\mathbb Z)$ or using any explicit element in it. This also avoids having to justify the existence of a $q$-expansion from $f(z+1)=f(z)$, for which I have always felt unsatisfied by the common three-word justification "by Fourier theory". Of course, depending of what you want to do next, this may be either an advantage or a shortcoming. If you need to discuss other congruences subgroups later, this is not the definition you want. But if what you need about modular forms is mainly their $q$-expansions, as in many arithmetical applications, this definition may be useful. 

By a principal series, one means of course a sub representation of $Ind_B^G \psi$, where $B$ is a Borel containing $T$ and $\psi: T \rightarrow \mathbb C^\ast$ a one-dimensional character. A glance at the table of characters found for example in Fulton-Harris shows that this is true for $GL_2$, so my intuition tells me that it should be true, and probably easy, in general, but the argument escapes me and I haven't seen this statement in the literature (e.g. in Curtis' survey or Digne and Michel's book). Also if the answer is yes, then can one remove the assumption that $G$ is split (that is we work with a general $\bf G$ as above, and take for $\bf T$ a quasi-split group, and ask the same question) ? 

Let me recall the definition which seems the most standard of Fricke polynomials. Let $G$ be the free group with two generators $u,v$. It is not very hard to prove that there exists a unique application $t : G \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}[X,Y,Z]$ such that (1) $t(u)=X,t(v)=Y,t(uv)=Z$, (2) $t$ is the character (i.e. the trace) of a representation $r : G \rightarrow \rm{SL}_2(K)$ where $K$ is some field containing $\mathbb{Z}[X,Y,Z]$. A Fricke polynomial is just an element of $\mathbb{Z}[X,Y,Z]$ which is in the mage of $t$. 

Ramanujan made his conjecture before Hecke gave his bound. As Lucia noted, the conjecture was based on empirical computation concerning the coefficients $\tau(n)$ of the $\Delta$ modular form, so Ramanujan would have had no reason to propose a conjecture less precise than what was apparently true. In other words, no one came up with the 1/2 power saving term. Ramanujan found directly the best possible bound, and the first one who proved something approaching, Hecke, was off by 1/2. 

I confirm what "someone once told you" about question 1 (so now "two people once told you" or perhaps "someone twice told you"). This phenomenon ($\pi_\nu$ supercuspidal, and $\pi'_\nu$ principal series, even unramified) occurs for example when $\pi$ and $\pi'$ are the non-tempered endoscopic representation in the discrete (or even cuspidal) spectrum that some people like to deform, for $U(3)$ and $GSP(4)$ and their inner forms. There is an article by Rogawski, "The multiplicity formula for A-packets" in the book "the Zeta Function of Picard Modular Surfaces", where he describes in details such an example for each of the two inner forms of $U(3)$ attached to a quadratic imaginary field $E$. You have analog examples for $GSP_4$, where $\pi$ is a Saito-Kurokawa lift of a modular form. 

Alternative method without using the cubic equation (of course not fundamentally different): the Galois representation $\rho: G_{\mathbb Q} \rightarrow GL_2(\mathbb Z/2 \mathbb Z)$ on the points of $2$-torsion of $E$ satisfies tr $\rho(Frob_p)=0$ for every odd prime $p$ by hypothesis, hence tr $\rho=0$ by Chebotarev. (edited:) It has obviously determinant $1$. Hence the semi-simplification of $\rho$ is $1 \oplus 1$ (a semi-simple representation of dim 2 is characterized by its trace and determinant, even in characteristic 2). Therefore $\rho$ fixes a line, and the non-zero point of this line is a rational 2-torsion point of $E$. 

As one says, proofs are useful not only to certify the truth of a statement, but also to remember and understand the statement better. But in this second function, proofs should not be understood only as "proof of the statement". Proofs that use the statement, instead, are also a very useful way to remember it. There was a time where I had difficulty to remember Nakayama. This time ended when I learnt the following basic result: Let $M$ be a finitely generated module over a local domain $A$ of maximal ideal $m$, residue field $A/m=k$, fraction field $K$. To such an $M$ one can attach two finite-dimensional vector spaces, one, $M \otimes_A K$ over $K$, the other, $M \otimes_A k = M/mM$ over $k$. Then one always $\dim_K M \otimes_A K \leq \dim_k M \otimes_A k$ with equality if and only if $M$ is free. I find this result much more striking and easy to remember than Nakayama itself. Yet it is essentially equivalent to it. Here is the proof: Take $e_1, \dots, e_n$ be a basis of $M \otimes_A k$. Lift this in a family $f_1,\dots,f_n$ of $A$. By Nakayama, $f_1, \dots, f_n$ generates $M$ as an $A$-module, hence $M \otimes_A K$ as a $K$-vector space, hence the stated inequality. If furthermore is is an equality, then $f_1,\dots,f_n$ is a basis of $M \otimes_A K$, hence $K$-free, hence $A$-free, hence an $A$-basis of $M$. 

This is not true, because the set of equivalence classes of irreducible tempered representation of $Gl_n(F_v)$ has the power of the continuum (think of the principal series for example) while the number of automorphic representations for $GL_n$ over $F$ is countable (if we fix the central character), since the separable Hilbert space $L^2_\chi(Gl_n({\bf{A}})/Gl_n(F))$ contains the Hilbert direct sum of all the cuspidal automorphic representations. 

There is an ambiguity in the question, which lies of course in the definition of moduli space, as the functor defining $A_g$ is not representable in the category of schemes. One solution, which seems the one considered implicitly by the OP (as suggested by the claim that for $g=1$ the moduli space is $\mathbb A^1$), and by Dan Petersen in his answer, is to define $A_g$ as the coarse moduli space of PPAV of genus $g$. And in this case, indeed, $A_g$ is not smooth. An other solution, which has many advantaged, is to consider $A^g$ not as a scheme but as an algebraic stack. In many respect this is the right thing to do, and in this case then $A^g$ is smooth as an algebraic stack. A proof for this is in the book of Faltings-Chai, Degenerations of abelian varieties. (PS: I believe that the OP is well-aware of this distinction coarse/fine moduli space, but since it was mentioned in the question nor in the first answer, it seemed important re recall it for other readers). 

The reciprocity of the title is the following not completely well-posed problem: Fix $P(X)$ a monic irreducible polynomial of degree $n$, with coefficients in $\mathbb Z$. "Describe" (in some sense) the set of prime $p$ such that $P \mod p$ has a given reduction (for example is irreducible, or on the opposite is a product of $n$ linear factors, etc.). As is well-known, when one root (hence all roots) of $P$ happens to be a cyclotomic integer (in particular in the very special case where $P$ is quadratic), then the problem has a precise solution, called Artin's reciprocity law, which is the core of class field theory. The sets of primes $p$ such that $P$ has a given reduction are then given by congruences modulo fixed integers satisfied by $p$, that is those sets are union of "set primes in artithemtic sequence". The Galois group of $P$ is abelian in this case. As the opposite of the complexity spectrum, there are polynomial $P(X)$ of degree $n \geq 5$, whose Galois group is big, say $S_n$, or $A_n$ in particular not solvable. In this case, it is my understanding that our only hope to find a reciprocity law in general is by making huge progress in the Langlands program.
