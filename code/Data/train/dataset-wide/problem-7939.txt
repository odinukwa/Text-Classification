Suppose I'd like to distribute a set of points $P=\lbrace p_1 ,\dots, p_n \rbrace$ in the unit square $S=[0,1]\times[0,1]$ to minimize a weighted sum of two things: 1) The average distance between a uniformly selected point in $S$ and its nearest neighbor in $P$, i.e. $D_{avg}(P) = \iint_S \min_i\lbrace\|x-p_i\|\rbrace dA $ , and 2) The sum of the edge lengths in a Delaunay triangulation of $P$, notated $DT(P)$, so that my problem can be written as $\mathrm{minimize}_P ~ D_{avg}(P) +\phi DT(P)$ for some scalar $\phi$. Let's suppose that we can also choose the number of points in $P$ as well. My question is: as $\phi\rightarrow0$, is the optimal solution $P^*$ going to be a honeycomb lattice? The honeycomb conjecture, $URL$ , would appear to suggest that the answer to my question would be "yes" if, instead of using a Delaunay triangulation, we took the sum of the edges of a Voronoi diagram of $P$, but even that will probably require quite a bit of work. 

In 1950s A. Borel, R. Bott, J. L. Koszul, F. Hirzebruch et al. investigated the coadjoint orbits as complex homogeneous manifolds. It was proven that each coadjoint orbit of a compact connected Lie group $G$ admits a canonical G-invariant complex structure and the only (within homotopies) $G$-invariant Kählerian metrics.

One can also show with Fermat's last theorem that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational - the answer of mt did $2^{1/n}$ for $n\ge 3$. Suppose that $\sqrt{2}$ is rational. Then there is a right-angled triangle with rational sides $(a,b,c)=(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2},2)$ and area 1. Hence $1$ would be a congruent number. This contradicts Fermat's last theorem with exponent $4$. 

If $G$ is a group of order $n$ with $gcd(n,\phi(n))=1$, then $G$ is cyclic. Conversely, if $n$ is an integer, such that every group of order $n$ is cyclic, then $gcd(n,\phi(n))=1$. So, counting these numbers is certainly interesting in group theory. Also nice (perhaps) is, that the the number of integers in $[1,n]$, coprime to $\phi(n)$ counts the number of incongruent primitive roots modulo $n$ , provided $n$ has a primitive root, i.e., the group $(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^{\ast}$ is cyclic. Of course, this number is $\phi(\phi(n))$. 

Suppose I have a collection of points $p_1,\dots,p_N$ in the plane. In the Euclidean $k$-medians (or $k$-means) problems, our objective is to distribute a set of $k$ points $x_1,\dots,x_k$ in the plane so as to minimize the distances (or squares of distances) to the points $p_i$, i.e. to minimize the quantity $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \min_j \| x_j - p_i \|$ (I am not requiring that the $x_j$'s be a subset of the $p_i$'s; they can lie anywhere in the plane). Obviously this problem has many practical applications. My question is: let's suppose we impose some constraints on the first or second moments of $x_1,\dots,x_k$, i.e. require that $\frac{1}{k}\sum_j x_j = x_0$ for some fixed point $x_0$, or that $\frac{1}{k} \sum_j \|x_j - \bar{x}\|^2 \leq S^2$ for some given threshold $S^2$. Is there any conceivable practical scenario where this might arise? I am not asking for assistance in solving this problem -- I'm really just interested in any thoughts on contexts where it might occur. 

Let $E/F$ be a quadratic field extension of p-adic fields. Let $V$ be a (skew-)Hermitian space and $U(V)$ be the unitary group. Let $GU(V)$ be the similitude unitary group. Given an irreducible smooth representation $\pi$ of $GU(V)$, do we know that the restriction $\pi|_{U(V)}$ has multiplicity one? For the pair $(GL(n),SL(n))$ similar results are proved by Tadic. For the pair $(GSp, Sp)$, similar results are proved by Adler-Prasad. I am wondering if the unitary group version is true or not. Thanks. 

I checked many answers but did not find this one. Probably I missed it. Let $G$ be reductive group over a p-adic field, $B$ be its Borel subgroup and $w_\ell$ be its long Weyl element. False belief: For a smooth compact supported function $f$ on $G$, then $f|_{B w_\ell B}$ is also smooth compact supported function on $B w_\ell B$. My advisor told me that this kind mistake is quite common for beginners. Here is another subtle false belief. Still let $F$ be a p-adic field and let $\mathfrak{p}$ be its prime. Consider the metaplectic double cover $$\widetilde {\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F)\rightarrow \textrm{Sp}_{2n}(F).$$ Here as a set $\widetilde {\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F) =\textrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)\times \{\pm 1\}$, and the multiplication in $\widetilde{\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F)$ is define by Rao cocycle $c=c_{Rao}$: $(g_1,\epsilon_1)(g_2,\epsilon_2)=(g_1g_2,\epsilon_1\epsilon_2 c(g_1,g_2))$. Let $K_m^n=(1+M_{n\times n}(\mathfrak{p}^n))\cap \textrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)$ be the standard congruence subgroup. False belief: The map from $K_m^n\rightarrow \widetilde {\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F),$ $k\mapsto (k,1)$ defines a group homomorphism if $m>>0$. This is false even when $n=2$ and I saw this statement in published papers. When $n=1$, this is correct. In general, the double cover $\widetilde {\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F)\rightarrow \textrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)$ splits over $K_m^n$ for $m$ large, but the naive map $k\mapsto (k,1)$ does not give the splitting for $n\ge 2$. 

I have come across the following result regarding equitable division of a resource, which is a simple and immediate consequence of linear programming complementarity (in the infinite-dimensional case). I strongly suspect that it is a special case of some other well-known principle, perhaps in a related field such as economics or even geography, but as of yet I have not found any helpful leads. Can anyone suggest any results from which the statement below is a consequence? Any other leads will also be appreciated. Let $R$ denote a contiguous resource (such as a piece of land) that is to be divided into $n$ pieces $R_1,\dots,R_n$ among $n$ agents (so agent $i$ gets piece $R_i$). Suppose that each agent has a continuous "utility density" function $u_i(x)>0$ defined on $R$ and that $R$ also has a continuous "population density" $f(x)>0$ defined on it. The total "utility" that agent $i$ receives is then $\iint_{R_i} f(x)u_i(x) dx$. One might consider the problem of choosing $R_1,\dots,R_n$ as "equitably" as possible, say by maximizing the minimum utility of the agents: $\text{maximize}_{R_1,\dots,R_n}\lbrace\min_i \iint_{R_i} f(x)u_i(x) dx\rbrace$ subject to $\bigcup_i R_i = R$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j$ It is easy to verify that, at the optimal solution $R_1^*,\dots,R_n^*$, all of the agents' utilities are equal. Now, define $q_i^* := \iint_{R_i^*} f(x) dx$ (the population of the $i$th optimal piece), and consider the problem of choosing regions to maximize the total utilities of the agents, but under a logarithmic utility function, and imposing constraints on the populations in each piece: $\text{maximize}_{R_1,\dots,R_n}\lbrace\sum_i \iint_{R_i} f(x)\log(u_i(x)) dx\rbrace$ subject to $\iint_{R_i} f(x) dx = q_i^*$ $\bigcup_i R_i = R$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j$ It is not hard to show that the solution to this problem is the same as the solution to the original problem. I have uploaded a MATLAB script that demonstrates this principle using cvx at $URL$ if anyone is interested. 

Over the complex numbers, there are several normal forms. A ternary cubic can be written as $$ \lambda XYZ-(X+Y+Z)^3 $$ with a parameter $\lambda$. This normal form is invariant under the symmetric group $S_3$ of permutations of variables. This leads to the so-called Hesse normal form, given by $$ X^3+Y^3+Z^3-3\mu XYZ. $$ It has the property that the Hessian of any of its members is of the same form. Hesse showed that the inflection points of a ternary cubic over the rationals are defined over a solvable extension. As a result, any ternary cubic can be brought to the Hesse normal form over a solvable extension of the base field. More precise details can be found in the reference: Ternary Cubic Forms and Etale Algebras, by Raczek and Tignol. 

Kostant and Sullivan proved that the Euler characteristic of a compact complete affine manifolds must vanish, affirming the Chern conjecture in the complete case (Bull. AMS 81 (1975)). Benzecri proved that a closed surface which admits a (possibly imcomplete) affine structure must have zero Euler characteristic. In general a good reference is the book "Spaces of constant Curvature" by Joseph A. Wolf (in particular for the link to Bieberbach groups). Also, several survey articles by W. Goldman on affine manifolds are a very good reference, e.g. Locally homogeneous manifolds, see page $11$ for recent work on Chern's conjecture. 

I believe the full details, along the lines of what domotorp posted, are provided in "Reconstructing sets of orthogonal line segments in the plane" by Rendl and Woeginger. From the abstract, "We show that reconstructing a set of $n$ orthogonal line segments in the plane from the set of their vertices can be done in $O(n log n)$ time, if the segments are allowed to cross. If the segments are not allowed to cross, the problem becomes NP-complete." The authors give a reduction to planar 3-SAT that uses points on an integer lattice, which I believe is the setting you're interested in. 

The only part I can answer definitively is #3, to which the answer is "no". If you place points in a square grid, the TSP tour is shorter than if you place points in a hexagonal lattice, but both satisfy the uniformness condition. As for #1, I think that the hexagonal lattice is conjectured to be the actual worst-case asymptotic distribution, but am unaware of any proof. You are probably aware of the following other references, which may be helpful: L. A. Goddyn. Quantizers and the worst-case euclidean traveling salesman problem. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 50(1):65–81, 1990. H. J. Karloff. How long can a euclidean traveling salesman tour be? SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2(1):91–99, 1989. K. J. Supowit, E. M. Reingold, and D. A. Plaisted. The travelling salesman problem and minimum matching in the unit square. SIAM Journal on Computing, 12(1):144–156, 1983. 

Using the parametrization $$ A= \begin{pmatrix} a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2&2bc-2ad &2bd+2ac \cr 2bc+2ad &a^2-b^2+c^2-d^2&2cd-2ab \cr 2bd-2ac &2cd+2ab &a^2-b^2-c^2+d^2\\ \end{pmatrix}, $$ which comes from quaternions of unit length we have $$ (1-tr (A))^2-\frac{1}{2} tr ((A-A^t)^2)-4= $$ $$ (9a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 3)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 - 1)=0, $$ since $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2=1$. 

As already mentioned, an easy argument using the Levi decomposition shows that there are three distinct indecomposable non-solvable Lie algebras of dimension $5$. However, I think it is worth to point out in this context that a full classification of all real $5$-dimensional Lie algebras has been given by G.M. Mubarakzyanov in $1963$, Izv. Vyssh. Uchebn. Zaved. Mat. 34. Besides the indecomposable non-solvable algebras we also have of course the decomposable non-solvable Lie algebras $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)\times \mathfrak{r}_2(\mathbb{R})$ and $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)\times \mathbb{R}^2$, where $\mathfrak{r}_2(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the non-abelian Lie algebra of dimension $2$. The Lie brackets for $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)\ltimes\mathbb R^2$, in a basis $e_1,\ldots e_5$ are given by $$ [e_1,e_2]=e_3,\; [e_1,e_3]=-2e_1,\; [e_1,e_5]=e_4, \; [e_2,e_3]=2e_2,\; [e_2,e_4]=e_5, $$ $$ [e_3,e_4]=e_4,\; [e_3,e_5]=-e_5. $$ A further reference is the paper of Roman Popovych (2003). 

In section 10 of Gan-Gross-Prasad's paper "Symplectic local root numbers, central critical L-values, and restriction problems in the representation theory of classical groups" $URL$ the authors stated that the full local Langlands conjectures for some small ranked classical groups are known, but no reference is given. Can anybody point out a reference for the SO(4) and SO(6) case? Do we know whether the local Langlands map preserves certain local epsilon or L-factors? Added: I appreciated the answer provided by Professor Kimball, which is very helpful. I do want to know more details about (split) SO(4). In the last section of Gross-Prasad's paper as given by Kimball, there is an exact sequence $$0\rightarrow SO_4(k)\rightarrow GL_2(k)\times GL_2(k)/\Delta k^* \rightarrow k^* \rightarrow 0.$$ To get the local Langlands conjecture for SO(4) from that of GL(2) from this exact sequence, it seems that we need to know the relationship between irreducible admissible representations of SO(4) and irreducible admissible representations of $GL_2(k)\times GL_2(k)/\Delta k^*$. Is this something standard or even trivial? On the other hand, in GGP, the authors stated that most local Langlands conjecture for classical groups should be established by the (forthcoming) book of Arthur and Moglin's papers. Arthur's books has already come out $URL$ . I never tried to read Arthur's book. What I would like to know is: whether they (Arthur and Moglin) proved the preservation of local epsilon and L-factors, or they just proved the existence of the local Langlands map.
