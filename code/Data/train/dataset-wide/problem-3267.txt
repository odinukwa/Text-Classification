In this first comprehensive review of the sneeze reflex in the English literature, there is no mention of how a sneeze might be suppressed. [1] The sneeze reflex 

which is similar to Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERMs) used for breast cancer therapy There are no studies looking at the effect on breast size in adults, and the measurement itself is somewhat difficult to do reproducibly.

You will note that nothing is said about curing T2DM. As for the very expensive DVD being promoted by the rawfor30days, then I think you're getting a raw deal. In the 5 minute video I watched, they used a Dr Gabriel Cousins who had his licence taken away in California ( but since reinstated ) and remains censured in New York. The documentary is filmed at his Tree of Life Rejuventation Center in Arizona. Note that he is ineligible for an Arizona medical license so has been practicing as a homeopath. [1] So, when at 0.29 in the trailer they say he's an MD, in some states this a misdemeanor when you haven't been granted a license to practice in that state. The more interesting question though is how T2DM can be reversed. We now have 3 year trial data from the STAMPEDE study [3] from last month's (May 2014) NEJM. 

This meta-analysis from 1992 by Hopkins of 76 trials where food was supplied by a metabolic kitchen nicely answers this question. [1]

The answer to your question is yes, studies have been conducted and there is a measurable effect on inflammatory markers. [1] 

Regarding Taubes' purported claim, that Keys picked the 7 countries for the 7 countries study knowing that their data would support his suspicions, then this is already addressed in his paper. The entry criteria included: 

Although there has been some criticism of this study in that the margarines of that time were likely high in transfats which could have contributed to the excess cardiovascular mortality, the suggestion is that it is much safer to ensure that you keep the ratio of n6:n3 PUFAs as low as feasible. 

This question is answered by research conducted by Richard Steckel [2] taken from military records, and data on skeletal remains [1] 

However, in the amount of meat that one might ordinarily consume and with the normal food preparation of removing visible fat, the effect on your health may not be that much different. I don't think the hypothesis that grass fed is better (or less bad) for cardiovascular health has been tested in prospective trials yet. [1] Daley CA, Abbott A, Doyle PS, Nader GA, Larson S.

The links above mention a lot of mumbo jumbo but do not give any science based reasoning on how a proton donor, or acid, which increases the concentration of hydrogen ions is somehow able to reduce the concentration of hydrogen ions in the blood. The link authors appear to be alternative medicine practitioners, and presumably alternative science practitioners as well. The chemical composition of lemon juice [1] is also nothing special to somehow create an alkalising effect on the body's pH.

Thus to interrupt the sneeze reflex before it reaches its explosive conclusion, one can try interfering with the causes by: 

A recent study using Resting-state functional-connectivity MRI is also interesting showing network disruption in CNS processing [2] 

and it was found that gastric-bypass was better than gastric-sleeve which was better again than intensive medical treatment. Some of these subjects were able to achieve normal blood gluose levels off medication ( ie. reversal ). 

In this small study of 14 healthy female subjects blood flow to skin and muscle was measured following acupuncture needle insertion: [1]

However, in addition to stimulation of the trigeminal nerve as documented above, there are other causes of sneezing as listed below: 

Tears also appear to contain a chemosignal, which not unexpectedly are a turn off for both sexes: [2] 

Now if you look at his graph together with Uffe Ravnskov's right hand graph where the claim of cherry picking is made. Ravnskov includes data for all 22 countries for mortality data and consumption of total fat ( not saturated fat as is stated in the question ) which was collected by Yurushalamy & Hilleboe ( using different sources from Keys ). 

Skeletal muscle insulin resistance then facilitates the development of fatty liver during positive energy balance ( eating too much, not enough exercise ). [2] 

so that even just seeing or smelling food can cause 30-40% of the bile to be released into the duodenum. The rest of the gallbladder contents are emptied under neuroendocrine control.

If the question is whether CRNA Alice Magaw used hyponosis as the sole anaesthetic as implied in the article linked to by your question, then the answer is, no. She talked to her patients to quieten their fears reassuring them whilst administering chloroform or ether. The paper she wrote describing her method of administering these gases can be read in full at the AANA archives 

Blood flow in skin and muscle was measured non-invasively, increased blood flow to muscle was demonstrated: 

Phytoestrogens have both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant abilities independent of their Estrogen Receptor (ER) binding actions. The latter action brings them under the class of endrocrine disruptors: 

Looks like to answer this question regarding the awareness or lack thereof of microsleeps, we are going to have to rely on expert testimony as to why some people lack awareness of this phenomenon. Dr. Katherine Sharkey, an assistant professor of medicine and psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University is quoted as saying, 

For some conditions where immunity is boosted by regular exposure, then it would seem that paediatricians might well have a more robust immune response. In this small study of 11 paediatricians they showed a more robust response to zoster antigens than controls, and a larger response to CMV antigens. However, there was no difference for Adenovirus 5, or tetanus toxoid. [1] For seasonal flu where there is no previous exposure, there should be no biological reason for them to be more immune than anyone else.

But it's clear that as a review they are reporting other people's even earlier work. (The full text of the journal is available for US$46.) But what they could not have known in 1998 is that there are other substances found in tea that prevent clot formation. The Daily Mail [2] reports 

I think we have to be skeptical of this claim that a tea bag offers additional help in stopping bleeding after dental extractions through chemical action vs just compression with a gauze cloth. First off there are no published studies of the efficacy of using tea bags. The claim is made often on various medical [0] and dental sites seemingly based on this paper [1] 

At present I don't think this question can be answered. The science of chemo-signalling in humans is at its infancy, and a number of substances secreted by humans have been found that have an effect on others. For instance the odorous steroid compound 4,16-androstadien-3-one (androstadienone), found in axillary sweat causes a hypothalamic response in both men and women.[1] 

One current thought is that the bacteria in the gut of a human omnivore is more able to metabolise food releasing nutrients otherwise unavailable to vegetarians. This might account for about 2% of the daily food intake, and works out to be about 5 lbs of weight gain a year.

Although intention to treat analyses found significant improvement in physician and patient global assessments, there was no difference between placebo and active treatment in measures such as ESR, CRP, tender and swollen joint counts, and HAQ scores. There has been some criticism of the trial including that the dose of methotrexate was escalated too slowly, and only 11% of subjects received doses greater than 15 mg per week, whereas 20 - 25 mg per week is more commonly used in the USA. Nevertheless we lack good evidence currently for the efficacy of methotrexate in PsA, and perhaps patients should be first trialled on Leflunomide for which we do have efficacy data. [2] 

The point of this is that T2DM is more likely to reverse with greater weight loss no matter how you achieve it. If you sequester 6 people onto a remote ranch and put them onto a calorie restricted raw food diet, or, you put them onto a Newcastle 600 kcalorie ( 500 kcals from Optifast sachets, 110 cals from non-starchy vegs ~ 600 cals ) diet for 8 weeks, then some of these people will greatly improve their diabetes. What is important is how sustainable these temporary dietary changes are as without intensive lifestyle modification that can be sustained in the future their T2DM is likely to relapse. So, the point of all this is, yes, it's feasible a raw food diet for 30 days could potentially reverse T2DM, but only through the mechanism of severe caloric restriction.

There are no studies on PubMed with the terms "clay, poultice and tendintis/tendonitis" so we can conclude that there has been no peer reviewed published research in this area to support the claims. Medline Plus advises on the management of tendinitis [1]
