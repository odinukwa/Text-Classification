Lets assume we're dealing with a superior planet, which is to say, the planet is orbiting at a greater distance than the Earth. This effectively ensures that there is no planetary phase to deal with. Now, the sun has a luminosity of $L_{sun}$ such that the Solar flux as seen by the planet is $$ f_{planet} = \frac{ L_{sun} }{ 4 \pi d_s^2 }. $$ The cross section of the planet is about $A = \pi r_p^2$, so for a given albedo $a_p$ the reflective luminosity of the planet will be \begin{aligned} L_{planet} &= a_p f_{planet} A \\ &= a_p \pi r_p^2 \frac{ L_{sun} }{ 4 \pi d_s^2 }. \end{aligned} Given that we know the absolute magnitude of the sun, the absolute magnitude of the planet follows as \begin{aligned} V_{planet} &= -2.5 \log_{10}\left[ \frac{ L_{planet} }{ L_{sun} } \right] - V_{sun} \\ &= -2.5 \log_{10}\left[ a_p \frac{ r_p^2 }{ 4 d_s^2 } \right] - V_{sun} \end{aligned} The apparent magnitude of the planet as seen from Earth can then be calculated as $$ m_{planet} = V_{planet} + 5 \log_{10}\left[ d_{e-p} \right] - 5 $$ where the distance between Earth and the planet, $d_{e-p}$, should be in parsec and of course depends on the orbital phase of the two respective planets. So the one additional parameter required was the Solar luminosity. There are probably a bunch of subtle effects with he albedo and the geometry of the system that are not taken into account here, but it should be a fair approximation. 

The transferred matter has velocity and angular momentum which is set by the motion of the companion star. The matter is being transferred in a rotating system, so from the neutron star's reference frame it is subject to the Coriolis effect. 

This looks like readout noise to me. Such noise is a consequence of the electric machinery used to convert the individual pixel detections into a digital picture, and really is an unavoidable part of CCD technology. Take a look at this page if you want to know more about the technical details. 

I'd recommend taking a look at this review paper. The author is well known for doing SPH simulations of lunar formation models, so it should provide a good starting point. On a side note, the most popular moon formation theory is probably the giant impact hypothesis which suggests that the moon formed after a large body collided with the proto-earth. However, you should be aware that there are severe problems with this model as it cannot properly explain the moon composition and/or the the angular momentum in the earth-moon system. This paper gives a rather critical (and technical) discussion of the giant impact model and might also provide an interesting read. 

The standard model for the formation of millisecond pulsars is the recycling scenario. The starting point of this model is a stellar binary system consisting of a neutron star and a secondary 'regular' star, where the neutron star is a normal pulsar with a rotational period of roughly $\sim7$ seconds. Because a neutron star is such a compact object, its gravitational influence is very large ($F_g \propto M/R^2$). If the two stars are close enough, the outer layers of gas may be pulled of the companion star and flow towards the neutron star. All this matter will settle into an disk structure around the neutron star and start orbiting faster and faster as it draws closer to the surface ($v_{orbit} = \sqrt{GM/R}$). By the time this matter touches down on the neutron star surface its orbital period can be as fast as a millisecond, certainly significantly faster than the neutron star. This bit of motion (or more precisely, the angular momentum) is then transferred to the neutron star (this process is called accretion), causing it to rotate slightly faster (spin-up). After some $0.1\sim0.2 M_{\odot}$ (where $M_{\odot}= 2 \times 10^{30}$ kg gives the mass of the Sun) of material is transferred to the neutron star, its rotational period will have decreased from a few second down to milliseconds. The transfer of this much matter takes a very long time, roughly $10^8$ to $10^9$ years. After this time, and with all the redistribution of mass, the binary system is expected to widen which causes the mass transfer to stop. As the region around the neutron star clear up, the radio emission mechanism turns back on (this mechanism does not work during the accretion stage) and we are left with a millisecond pulsar. From this point on the neutron star will behave like a regular pulsar: over the course of a very long time it will convert its rotational energy in radio emission and slow down until it becomes to slow to act as a pulsar. As for the evidence for this model; such binary systems containing an accreting neutron star emit massive amounts of X-ray emission (hence called X-ray binaries) and have been known to exist since the 60's, long before the first millisecond radio pulsar was discovered (in 1982). This entire scenario was proposed quickly after, but could not be confirmed for a very long time. It was only in the late 90's that a neutron star was found whose X-ray emission was pulsed at millisecond periods (see this, and this), confirming that these neutron stars are indeed spinning up. The final piece of evidence; a millisecond pulsar which switches back and forth between X-ray and radio emission was only found very recently. 

Physically there is nothing dictating the distances between dishes. These telescope arrays are interferometers. By combining the signal of the two dishes you can achieve a spacial resolution of a giant virtual dish that is about as large as the distance (called the baseline) between the two real telescopes. A nice example of the power of this technique is the VLBI, which is essentially such an array only the individual dishes are actually just observatories all over the world. For more detail on how this all works exactly take a look at the wiki pages on aperture synthesis and astronomical interferometry. 

Earth's gravity is quite weak. It manages to compress air (luckily for us), but that's about it. Since the Earth is not a black hole it can never compress something else to be a black hole. That being said, lets consider some object and assume something compresses it to a black hole. The Schwarzschild radius is defined as $$ R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}. $$ Now lets say the object is a sphere of radius $R_s$, then its uniform density is $$ \rho = \frac{M}{ \frac{4\pi}{3} R_s^3 }. $$ Using this to get rid of the mass term leaves us with $$ R_s = \frac{2G \rho \frac{4\pi}{3} R_s^3}{c^2} $$ Inverting this expression gives the black hole density for a given radius $$ \rho = \frac{3 c^2}{8 \pi G R_s^2}. $$ Notice that if you want a really small black hole, say $R=1$ m, the density has to be about $1.6\times10^{26}$ kg/m$^3$. That's about 20 times the mass of Earth stuffed in a cubic meter, so quite a lot. But if the black hole can be as large as we please, then the density can get extremely low. A great example of this are supermassive black holes, which have about the same density as water (that's $10^3$ kg/m$^3$). 

In short, no, you don't have to solve Kepler's equation. If you define a viewing longitude and you know the full set of Keplerian orbital elements, you can calculate if a planet will show a transit. Let me first clear up some of the jargon, though. The term inclination is traditionally reserved for the angle between the orbital plane and the reference plane. So unless the entire orbit is wobbling (for instance due to precession) the inclination will be constant for all positions of the planet. The angle that varies as the planet moves through the reference plane is the latitude. However, in this particular problem calculating the latitude isn't particularly useful. The more practical coordinate to look at is the height of the planet away from the plane, I'll call this $r_z$. If along your observers line of sight you find $r_z$ to be smaller than the solar radius, the planet will show a transit. Working out a fully general elliptical orbit in 3 dimensions is somewhat tricky, so I'll start out with a simple Cartesian coordinate system aligned with the orbital plane. In subsequent steps I work my way back using a number of coordinate transformations. First a list of the Kepler parameters and their meaning: 

If your $r_{peak}$ is not known a priori then you have two unknowns and only one equation: this cannot be solved. At least not without a second equation or a measured $(\rho,r)$-pair (say the central density $\rho_0 = \rho(r=0)$). In any case, this definition of radial density looks like an ad-hoc assumption to me, and not something that came out of a proper hydrodynamic model. So without knowing why you chose this form or the context of your disk model I can't comment on what equation is best suited to determine $r_{peak}$. A well-informed guess seems like the way to go. 

While the other answer here and the link provided by Jeremy give excellent explanations, I believe a bit more nuanced reasoning is required. Although the theory of planet formation is currently still incomplete, it is generally accepted that planets form in a so-called proto-planetary disk as a part of stellar formation process. This is backed up by several observation of such disk and even by directly observed planets in systems where remnants of the disk are still present (most notably Fomalhaut-b). However, exactly how these planets form is still unclear. A popular theory is that these planets form in place and therefore keep the orientation and inclination of the disk. This beautifully explains the Solar System and specifically why all planets have roughly the same orbital inclination. But that's not surprising as the model was specifically designed to do just that! Yet the Solar System does not have to be the only possible type of planetary system, or even the most common for that matter. Indeed the study of exoplanets has confirmed that very different planetary systems are possible. An alternative theory is that planets are created far away from the star and migrate inwards. During this migration multiple planets can interact with one-another and be pushed out of the disk plane to higher inclinations. They could even flip over completely and become retrograde. Now to come back to the actual question; the Solar planets probably have about the same inclination simply because they were created that way. You are also right in saying that gravity will tend to align the planets. How this works physically is that the star can exerts a torque on the planet, which produces a tidal effect (like how the Moon creates tides on Earth). Over time this aligns the angular momentum of the planet to that of the star by pushing the planet towards the equatorial plane of the star. As for your second question, yes, there are probably planetary systems which are misaligned with respect to the star. At least there are certainly planets that are not aligned with the equatorial plane of the star. The well named HAT-P-11b is a known example, but there are a lot more. Note that for exoplanets the important parameter is not the inclination (which for exoplanets is the angle between the normal of the orbit and the line of sight), but rather the obliquity or tilt of the planet rotation with respect to the rotation of the star. As for a third twist to this story, very recently there was a discovery of an entire proto-planetary disk that is misaligned with respect to the star, which opens the door to even stranger configurations. 

Then, as the matter stream moves down the potential well, it will fall behind the neutron star (Coriolis effect), only to loop around and settle into an orbit (angular momentum). The disk then rotates in the same direction as the orbital motion, making it prograde with with neutron star rotation. Note that this explanation is rather simple and by no means comprehensive. There may very well be peculiar situations in which a retrograde disk forms. I know that at least for black hole binaries there are some systems suggested to be retrograde. For more details on mass transfer you can look at this file. 

This is a fun question, so I spend some time thinking about it. This is what I came up with. Is this possible? Yes, this is certainly possible. Just consider the Solar System itself. We have a massive central body, the Sun, and several tiny subsystems (planets with their moons) orbiting it. Is it stable? Again, from the simple observation that the Solar System exists in its current form, we know that such a system can remain more or less stable over a significant portion of the stellar lifetime. A more difficult problem, I think, is if can it be formed in the first place. Could it be habitable? This is a tricky question as it critically depends distances between the several orbiting bodies. Lets consider the orbital mechanism and derive from what we know of the Solar System. In the following I've assumed the gas planet is Jupiter and the fictional planetary system consists of a Sun', Jupiter', Earth' and Moon' such that the apostrophe denotes the fake object. These fake objects are identical to the real equivalents, except for their orbital configuration and relative distances. If you want a different system you can follow the same line of reasoning, but plug in different numbers for the fake objects. Now, we know that the Earth-Moon system exists in a stable orbit around the Sun, which means that at 1 AU the gravitational force of the Sun is not strong enough to destabilize the Moon orbit. From this we can find a lower limit on the gravitational force that Jupiter' may exert on the Moon' \begin{aligned} F_{J'M'} &= F_{SM} \\ \frac{ M_{J'} M_{M'}}{r_{J'M'}^2} &= \frac{ M_{S} M_{M}}{r_{SM}^2} \end{aligned} Solving this equation we get \begin{aligned} r_{J'M'} &= r_{SM} \left( \frac{ M_{J'} M_{M'} }{ M_{S} M_{M} } \right)^{1/2} \\ &= r_{SM} \left( \frac{ M_{J'} }{ M_{S} } \right)^{1/2} \end{aligned} which evaluates to about 0.03 AU. So the Earth'-Moon' system should have an orbital radius around Jupiter' of at least 0.03 AU. Now the question is if the Earth-Moon system can remain bound in its orbit around Jupiter. To answer this we can safely ignore the Moon' and assume it remains tightly bound to the Earth'. The potentially destabilizing force on the Jupiter'-Earth' system is again the gravitational pull of the Sun', but now on the Earth'. We can do a similar trick as before, but now we need to account for a different mass ratio. So lets require that the fraction of forces be equal in both cases: $$ \frac{F_{SM}}{F_{EM}} = \frac{F_{S'E'}}{F_{J'E'}} $$ with some algebra this gives $$ r_{S'J'} = r_{J'E'} \frac{r_{SM}}{r_{EM}} \left(\frac{M_E}{M_J}\right)^{1/2} $$ which for $r_{J'E'} = $0.03 AU evaluates to a minimum orbital radius of about 0.7 AU. This greatly surprised me as it means you can comfortably fit the entire Jupiter'-Earth'-Moon' system inside the habitable zone, meaning that in principle life should be possible. Of course the seasons on such a planet would be rather extreme.
