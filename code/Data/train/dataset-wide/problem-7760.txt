As noted in the comments, this is false in general. For instance, if $K=\mathbb Q(e^{2i \pi/p})$, then $G=(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^\ast$. If you take $C=\{1\}$, then condition (a) is that $q \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ and condition (b) is that $q \not \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ which makes finding such primes $q$ a desperate task. There is however a general situation where the answer is positive: when the group $G$ has no quotient isomorphic to a quotient of $(\mathbb Z/p \mathbb Z)^\ast$, in particular, when the group $G$ is perfect (equal to its own derived subgroup). In this case, indeed, the extension $K(e^{2i \pi/p})/\mathbb Q$ has a Galois groups with subjects to both $G$ and $(\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^\ast$, hence which is isomorphic by Goursat's lemma and our assumption to $G \times (\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z)^\ast$, and by Cebotarev you can find primes $q$ such that $Frob_q$ is in the class $C \times 1$ in this group. (Of course, this is a very standard argument in the field) 

This is true. Let $R$ be a ring satisfying your property. Then $R$ has no nilpotent element since if $x^a=0$, then for $b$ an integer such that $n(x)^b > a$ we have $x=x^{n(x)^b}=0$. So the radical of $R$ is $0$, and since the radical is the intersection of all prime ideals of $R$, we see that the natural map $R \mapsto \prod_{P} R/P$ is an injection. It therefore suffices to prove the result for $R/P$, that is for a domain. Assuming no that $R$ is a domain, the equation $x^{n(x)}-x=0$ factors as $x=0$ or $x^{n(x)-1}=0$. So, in $R$, every non-zero element is a root of unity. This is also true of the fraction field $K$ of $R$. No $K$ is of characteristic $p>0$, since otherwise it would contain $\mathbb{Q}$ which contains many non-roots-of-unity such as $2$. And clearly, $K$ is algebraic over the prime field. So we're done. 

Proof of the claim: (2) implies (1) because if $\mathcal P$ is as in (2), $(K_{i,j})_{(\mathcal P)}=\mathbb Q_p$, and $D_{i,j} \otimes (K_{i,j})_{(\mathcal P)} = \mathbb Q_p$; thus the $\rho_{i,j}$ for that fixed $i$ are all defined over $\mathbb Q_p$, and so is their sum over $j$, that is $r_i$, and $r_i$ being faithful defined an embedding of $G$ into $Gl_n(\mathbb Q_p)$. Proof of (1) implies (2). If $G$ can be embedded into $Gl_n(\mathbb Q_p)$ let $r$ be the embedding, that we see as an $n$-dimensional representation over $\mathbb Q_p$. Embedding $\mathbb Q_p$ to $\mathbb C$, we see $r$ as a complex representation which is thus one of the $r_i$. So $r_i$ is defined over $\mathbb Q_p$, which means that all the $\rho_{i,j}$ are, which in turns means that (2) holds y the lemma below. (end of proof of the claim) 

Edit: As requested, I give here the proof of the statement about $t$. I believe that this statement is due in some form to Fricke in the nineteenth century: If $t:G \rightarrow K$ is the trace of a representation $r: G \rightarrow {\rm{SL}}_2(K)$, then one has $t(gh)+t(gh^{-1}) = t(g)t(h)$ for all $g,h$ in $G$ (since this formula holds when $t$ is the trace, and $g,h$ are matrices in ${\rm SL}_2(K)$, as easily checked). Now this formula, and an easy induction on the length of a word $g$ in $G$ shows that $t(g)$ can be expressed as a polynomial (with integral coefficients) in $t(u)$, $t(v)$ and $t(uv)$. Hence a $t$ satisfying (1) and (2) is unique if it exists. For the existence, let $U$ and $V$ be two matrices in ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ such that tr$U$, tr$V$, and tr$UV$ are algebraically independent (this is really easy). Then see $\mathbb{Z}[X,Y,Z]$ as a subring of $\mathbb{C}$ by sending $X$ on tr$U$, $Y$ on tr$V$, $Z$ on tr$UV$. Let $r$ be the representation $G \rightarrow \rm{SL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ sending $u$ on $U$ and $v$ on $V$, and $t=$tr $r$. Then by definition $t$ satisfies (2), with $K=\mathbb{C}$, one has $t(u)=X$, $t(v)=Y$, $t(uv)=Z$ by construction and $t$ takes value in the subring $\mathbb{Z}[X,Y,Z]$ of $\mathbb{C}$ by what we have said earlier. Hence the existence of $t$. 

I understand and share quid's bewilderment. There are easily more than 5000 articles whose main theme can be considered, without stretching too much, as "congruencies between Fourier coefficients of modular forms - and generalizations", including some of the most famous of the last four decades, like the one proving Fermat's last theorem. The theory of congruences between modular forms has blossomed in many directions. You may want to look at work of Serre, Katz, Hida, Mazur, Ribet, Wiles (and others) in the 70's and 80's for the beginning of the story. Edit: There are so many directions of generalizations that it's hard to decide where to begin with. Swinnerton-Dyer works with congruences between two modular forms of the same level and the same weights. Those congruences are in some sense "accidental". Several papers by Hida (like this one "congruences between cusp forms and special values of their Zeta functions") hace generalized this line of thought. Besides, one can consider congruences between forms of the same level and various weights -- and you get the theory of p-adic modular forms, Hida families, eigencurve, etc. Or congruences between forms of the same weights and different level -- you get to the level-raising and level-lowering result of Ribet's and other. Ribet's ICM talk is a good introduction to this. Then you get all the generalization to other automorphic forms... 

To complement the answer from GH from MO: Your first two bullet points, about Tate's thesis and Hecke characters are completely correct. Your third point should be made more precise as follow. Yes we can prove the functional equation for the L-function attached to automorphic representations of $GL_n$, and a bunch of other things for them: that they have a meromorphic continuation, where the poles are if any, then as you say the functional equation, and then the non-vanishing of these L-function on the line $\Re s=1$ (the analog of the Hadamard-De la Vall√©e Poussin theorem). Roughly we know these automorphic $L$-functions almost as well (or as badly) as the Riemann Zeta function. ("Almost" because we don't know the Ramanujan hypothesis, that is we only know that the series defining these functions converges in a half-plane slightly smaller as what we expect, but in the grand scheme of things that's a detail. "as badly", because like for the Riemann Zeta Function, we expect them to satisfy the Riemann hypothesis, and we have no idea how to prove it.) All these results are due to Jacquet-Shalika (except for $n=1$, where they are due to Hecke and Tate), and were proved relatively early in the development of the theory of automorphic forms.And while Jacquet-Shalika's proof are hard and very clever, they don't use the Arthur-Selberg trace formula, let alone the fundamental lemma which was proved much later. For your fourth point, as GH says, it would be correct (as a very rough statement) if you replaced "local" by "global". And the same is true for your fifth. 

My question is about the theory of complexity, but let me first explain my motivation, which comes from number theory or more precisely from trying to understand a question/conjecture of Serre and a remark he made about it. Yesterday at Harvard, Jean-Pierre Serre gave a wonderful colloquium on "Variation with $p$ of the number of solutions mod $p$ of a system of polynomial equations". There was many things in it, most of them I knew (but beautifully explained nevertheless), but some lines of thought seemed completely new (and at least they surely where for me): Let $P(X)$ be a fixed non-zero polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[X]$. Let us denote by $N(p)$ the number of solution of $P(X) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$. Serre noticed that there was a very simple, efficient and old algorithm, already present in a paper by Galois and probably older (since Galois refers to it as well-known), to compute $N(p)$ for big values of $p$: compute by Euclid's method the gcd of $X^p-X$ and $P(X)$ in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}[X]$. The degree of this polynomial is the number of solutions $N(p)$. The algorithm, Serre said, runs in $O(\log(p)^{2+\epsilon})$. Now if it happens that all roots of $P(X)$ are in a cyclotomic fields (for example, a quadratic polynomial) then $N(p)$ is determined by some congruences, that is there is an $m$ such that $N(p)$ depends only on $p \pmod{m}$ (For $P$ quadratic, it is just the quadratic reciprocity law), and in this case, determining $N(p)$ can be made in $O(\log p)$ steps obviously. Serre asked (or conjectured, I don't remember for sure the term he used) if conversely, the existence of an algorihhm in linear time $O(\log p)$ to compute $N(p)$ would imply that all roots of $P$ are in a cyclotomic field. After that he made a remark that I didn't fully understand, that he had asked some friends that were specialists of complexity theory and and that they told him there were not theorem proving statement like "for a given problem, there is no algorithm solving it in linear time", but I am not sure if this was really that, nor if he was talking only of this specific problem or of all computable problems. Well, my question just aims to understand Serre's remark
