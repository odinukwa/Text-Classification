The Bloch constant B (based on a theorem introduced by André Bloch in 1925 on the maximum radius of a one-to-one disk in the image of a normalized analytic function of the unit disk, see for instance Remmert Funktionentheorie II or Steven Finch marvelous "Mathematical Constants") was conjectured by Ahlfors to be $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}}}\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})\Gamma(\frac{11}{12})}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{4})}$$ (This value, if I remember well Ahlfors' article corresponds to a particular function that he constructed for this purpose). The Bloch Constant $B$ is currently known to be at least slightly greater than $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$ (several articles improving upon each other by Mario Bonk, Chen and Gauthier, Xiong). Has there been some progress since 1998 on the lower bound ? Same question for the closely related (univalent) Landau constant (quite often called Bloch-Landau constant, sometimes seen as $B_\infty$) ? The conjectured upper bound is $$\frac{\Gamma(\frac{1}{3})\Gamma(\frac{5}{6})}{\Gamma(\frac{1}{6})}$$ 

Still another formulation: I recall hearing the whole idea being referred by a metaphor of skeleton and flesh. The "mass" of your example would be the "skeleton weight" or "bone mass" of the collection, the amount of "flesh" around each "bone" (the radius of the muscle ?) being the size of the automorphism group. I find the groupoid cardinality sensible too and perfectly compatible with the basic results of Polya theory, and will certainly use it in the future. I note that this is the converse operation of counting things with multiplicities such as roots. 

(too long or too complicated as a comment). There are at least two relevant properties in your problem. The part of the expression inside your initial sum that does not depend on $c$ is already equal to the result. \begin{align*}\sum _{d=0} ^{n} \frac{1}{d!(n-d)!} \frac{\Gamma (b+d) \Gamma (b+n-d)}{\Gamma (b) \Gamma (b)} = \frac{1}{n!} \frac{\Gamma(2b+n)}{\Gamma(2b)} = \frac{1}{n!}\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}(2b+i), \end{align*} a binomial sum (or a finite product if you like) you can manipulate in many ways. You succeeded in finding a one-arbitrary-complex-parameter weight expression that leaves that sum invariant. It is a very interesting property that can be exploited if one sees this sum as a discrete probability distribution. The sum without the $c$ fractions is probably a limit when $c$ approaches an integer. Another related point is that the original summand is invariant by $d\rightarrow n-d$ so you would always obtain a symmetric distribution. 

In Group Theory there is a notion stronger than isomorphism, i.e. similarity. For two permutation groups to be "similar" there must exist both an isomorphism between the group and a compatible (commuting in the categorical sense) isomorphism between the sets being permuted. The couple of these two isomorphisms is called a similarity. Two permutation groups can be isomorphic but not similar. Similarity is useful to compare group constructions such as the wreath product, group presentations and classifications of subgroups of the symmetric groups. In these situations, using only isomorphism would be a mistake and would lose information. 

I would also advise (especially if they were published in french journals, such as the articles by Elie Cartan, Frechet, Henri Cartan) GALLICA and NUMDAM You can often download whole articles, depending on date and copyright. Here you have an obituary for Sophus Lie in the Weekly Accounts of the French Science Academy in 1899 (CRAS 1899, p525). 3 important original articles from Sophus Lie, probably on GDZ for the first 2. Sophus Lie, Über Complexe, insbesondere Linien- und Kugel-Complexe, mit Anwendung auf die Theorie partieller Differentialgleichungen; Mathematische Annalen Vol 5, pp145- 256 (1872) Sophus Lie, Untersuchungen über Transformationsgruppen. II; Archiv for Mathematik og Naturvidenskab vol 10, pp353-413 (Kristiania 1886) Sophus Lie, unter Mitwirkung von Friedrich Engel, Theorie der Transformationsgruppen III, 1895. Printed as a book I think. I have it as chapters in the Chelsea reprint. 

Just to stress a few points already addressed in comments and answers: Euler in his time discovered many important facts and solutions to classical questions, advanced rigor and gave examples of the power of the recently created methods (infinitesimal calculus), popularized the science of his day (notably books dedicated to a German Princess), wrote some of the first textbooks in analysis (still pleasant reading today), gave strength to the prussian and russian academy of science, courtized by two of the most powerful powers of the day (the King of Prussia and the Czar of Russia), filled international academic journals, some of them he edited himself, with quality articles (in fact up to several decades after his death because of the sheer size of his output), fostered international cooperation, wrote in the most important languages of his day (latin, french, german, I think he also learned russian), published in applied science, was part of state scientific advisory commission, etc. In fact Euler's work has been instrumental in progressively establishing the "rigor" some of us are so proud of. So a better equivalent of his investigation of what we call now Zeta(2 n) and the Gamma function would be the solution of outstanding problems by one of the most recognized mathematician of his day building on recent work by one of his even more famous and established mathematician, Bernoulli, who was his PhD advisor and whose several family members have established positions in the scientific community. I think he would have no difficulty publishing it. And his work would be quickly read and commented upon by many other mathematicians. Even if we imagine a Leonard Euler finding himself straight-jacketed by the mathematical discourse and style of the XXIst century, he would pair up with another good mathematician to write scholarly articles, as Ramanujan and Hardy used to do at the beginning of the XXth in a mutually benefical couple. 

This last one, for the sine function, is even more bewildering to me. There is something that looks very much like a Mandelbrot set there. Why? 

Black pixels are points where the software cannot detect periodicity. The correspondence between colors and numbers is as follows, where 'Unk' means 'Unknown': 

Sin and exp At the risk of going on too long, I think it's natural to also address a similar question for the sine and exponential functions. Here is the picture for exp: 

Motivation Two of my colleagues were discussing the behavior of cos along the positive real axis on our department mailing list. I was curious about the complex behavior, but this is outside my field, so started making pictures like the ones shown here. I've been thinking about these off and on for a little over a year, but not really made any progress or had anyone give me a useful reference. So I wanted to see what the wider MO community has to say. If you want some higher-resolution pictures for cos, see this G+ post: $URL$ 

Are there standard or known weights/metrics on cyclic orders? Cyclic orderings are different ways of listing elements from a finite set, where you call two lists the same if they differ only by a rotation. For example, the ways that 4 people can sit at a circular table, where you ignore rotation of the table. So the following 4 rankings of a 4-item set should be considered the same: 

In particular, one can see the behavior along the positive real axis matches the description above. (Although there are no axes in this picture, I have verified separately that the transition point in the picture is correct.) Unfortunately, I have no idea how to explain the rest of the picture! Although I have been careful writing the software, I can't say with certainty that the picture is correct anywhere other than the positive real axis. This question is in danger of being too general, so here is one specific question to answer: Is the cardoid-shaped region colored 1 correct? I would, of course, also be happy to hear any other verifications of features in this picture, or other behavior of $P(z)$ not depicted. 

Do strictly symmetric monoidal topologically-enriched categories model all connective spectra? If your modeling functor is some reasonable variant of the ordinary classifying space functor, I think the answer must be No. What I know for sure about this question is written (with Angélica Osorno) in this paper: Modeling stable one-types. In that paper we study how to model the Postnikov data of spectra with just two nonzero homotopy groups (in dimension 0 and 1). The Postnikov data in such a low-dimensional case consists only of the two (abelian) homotopy groups $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$, together with a Postnikov invariant. Therefore we restrict not only to symmetric monoidal categories, but to those symmetric monoidal categories where all morphisms are invertible and all objects are invertible up to isomorphism. (The standard term for these is "Picard categories", but a more descriptive name would be "grouplike symmetric monoidal groupoids".) The sloganized summary of the paper is that the symmetry of the Picard category is the data which corresponds to the Postnikov invariant of the stable 1-type. (There's a neat connection with the theory of quadratic maps, and some calculations of Eilenberg and Mac Lane from the 1950's, which partially explain why you might expect this.) I'll skip the precise details here -- you can try the paper, or just ask me later. For a specific example, we write down a symmetric monoidal category which models the Postnikov truncation of the zeroth space of the sphere spectrum. It has a strictly associative and unital monoidal structure, but the symmetry is nontrivial. 

A first simple idea is the following: given a permutation $a$, count the number of $i$ such that $a(i+1) \neq a(i) +1$, where $0 \leq i \leq n$ and index addition is performed modulo $n$. A natural variation on this idea would sum $|a(i+1) - (a(i)+1)|$. I haven't thought about either of these too carefully yet. Do they appear in the literature somewhere? Some nontrivial internet searching hasn't turned anything up. 

As far as I can check, in french this issue does not arise. The only available description is "moins x" or "moins 3", corresponding to "minus x" or "minus 3". The closest equivalent of "negative x" would be "x négatif" and it would only be used in phrases such as "pour x négatif", meaning "for x < 0" and not as a description of part of such a formula. "Négatif" seems to me mostly used in french in a categorical way "températures négatives", "nombres négatifs". It would be informative if native german, russian, chinese, etc. speakers could comment on this. 

Since all the known non-trivial zeroes of Riemann Zeta function are on the Re(z)=1/2 line we only give their imaginary parts, but in fact their are complex, $$1/2+ i*14.1347251417346937904572519835624702707842571156992431756855674601499...$$ being the first above the real line. If Riemann Hypothesis is true we will never have to mention a different real part. 

In combinatorics, the (Pascal) Binomial Triangle more or less started the entwining of combinatorics, probability and algebra. The other two most seminal and ubiquituous triangles of numbers are the Stirling (duals between 1st and 2nd sort, permutation world and set world, the most often generalized family of numbers) and the Eulerian numbers (permutations seen as words on ordered alphabet), the reference statistics on permutations. For links between combinatorics and number theory, I think the first prize would be the Bernoulli numbers. 

Another source are books about the camera obscura and pinhole photography. More contemporary: the techniques used to enhance digital images and their perspective with mathematical models of camera lens deformation have given birth to relatively sophisticated applied mathematics. There are a few private companies such as DxO selling software to correct (among other things) perspective in image files by reversing the nonlinear effects of multiple lens systems found in camera. 

There is a french talk by Alexander Zvonkin which can be a good introduction to this subject as well. If readers are interested I can translate parts of it in english. 

Motif in french has both the meaning of english "motive" and of "pattern". It is still actively used in decorative arts and art history "Cette tasse est ornée d'un très joli motif", "This cup is decorated with a very pretty pattern", and so on for tapestry, greek freeze, wallpaper, etc. And still used when describing a police case : "Il a un alibi et n'a aucun motif". So I believe that Grothendieck was well aware of this ambiguity. 

I am also interested in learning Chinese and Japanese enough to read mathematical articles. While also learning basic language notions with traditional courses, I am practicing by reading small and elementary mathematical wikipedia articles in english, chinese and japanese, that I sometimes translate back with google translate to match with the english version. I making slowly my own quadri-lingual dictionary (with english and french) with an electronic card system (Anki), so that key hanzi/kanji for mathematics allow me to progressively guess the subject of an article for instance. I devote some time to writing correctly by hand each new characters many times to reinforce memory by gesture and concentration. 

For permutation polynomials, you can also look into the relevant part of "Finite fields", by Rudolf Lidl and Harald Niederreiter, CUP. 

Its theme is the interaction of mathematical and artistic inquiries as characteristic of Western art in the Renaissance, with perspective and precise description of geometrical forms (such as polyhedra) as turning point, and embodied in several key artists such as Piero della Francesca, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht Dürer. The same author has written a book dedicated to Piero della Francesca: 

About learning about logarithmic integral and polylogarithm identities, there are large compendium of formulae on everything (Gradstein Ryzhik Jeffreys for instance), a few classic monographies such as Nielsen, Lewin, some new books (some of them with a physicist point of view since polylogarithm appear when dealing with Feynman path integrals among others) and also this online resource. You can print the pdf version of this list of dilogarithm identities for instance.
