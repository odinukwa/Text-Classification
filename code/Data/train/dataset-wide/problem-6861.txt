When demand exceeds supply. I am thinking of a simple example. Holding every other S&P 499 constant, if Apple issues their financial report claiming that last quarters they sold better than ever, more investors (in quantity) want to buy more stocks of Apple. The price of Apple stocks increases (though they are not issuing more stocks). This increase the market value of Apple (and of those investors holding the stocks already). In turn, this excess drives up the whole market. 

Could you please point out some (economics) relevant readings, both theoretical and empirical at micro-level, on how a non-profit organisation may choose some certain activities? and how it may introduce some activities? Could you please point out some relevant readings at micro-level on how/why organisations may choose/introduce/switch to some activities? 

We can clearly see that for the employee the messages (whether choosing a MA or BA degree) will have an effect on her payoffs. Therefore I conclude that the game is not cheap talk. But I'm not sure since this kind of games are characterised under cheap talk games, what makes a game cheap talk? How I can explain whether the game above is a cheap talk or not 

I've looked all over the internet but couldn't find a simple answer. My claim is that if none of the players utility functions depend on the messages being sent, then the game is a cheap talk. Consider this : 

My claims are 1- Backward induction solution is Nash equilibrium solution. 2- Not all Nash equilibria are sequentially rational 3- All Backward induction solutions are sequentially rational 4- SPNE solutions are Nash equilibria 5- SPNE solutions are sequentially rational if game has at least one proper sub game. If only has improper sub game then it may not be sequentially rational. 6- PBE solutions are Nash equilibrium and SPNE 7- PBE solutions are sequentially rational no matter what. 8- WPBE solutions are Nash equilibria. And sequentially rational no matter what. Are these true? What do you think? Anything want to add? 

I am trying to put forth a theory for endogenous supply chain formation. A set of $K$ complementary tasks need to be performed to manufacture a good $G$. If manufactured, there exists a demand function $d(p_G,q_G)$ that governs the price of the good in the market. Of the $K$ tasks involved in making the good, some are sequential and some are parallel (two complementary products combined to make one). In other words, there is a network (tree) structure that describes the ordering of the tasks. Now let us assume there are $N>K$ firms in the market. If a firm decides to take up a task, it incurs some fixed cost for the plant, and some variable cost, depending on the number of units produced. However if altogether only a subset of the $K$ tasks are alone accomplished by the firms, then there is no good produced. Thus each firm's decision to produce is contingent on its wealth, its expected profit and the decisions of other firms. My question: is there a similar theory for supply chain formation? I have read the following papers which come close to describing such formation but I find they are sufficiently different from what I have in mind. 

Hotelling rule states that at equilibrium $$\frac{\dot p(t)}{p(t)} = i$$ Meaning that rate of change of the price at time $t$ should be equal to $i$, the interest rate. Assume that the government pegs the price at the level $P^{*}$. Assume further that the shadow price at time t is given by: $Q_t =( \sigma i S_t)^\frac{-1}{\sigma}$ Show that if $\dot q(t)= i$ then $Q_t = P^{*}$ My questions: (1) what exactly is $\dot q(t)$ or $\dot p(t)$. Is it the derivative? I couldn't make sense out of it. (2) Is the hoteling condition given in logarithms? (3) And what method to go with after understanding (1)-(2) EDIT: Yes, this is a homework question. However I never asked you to solve the question. I asked what kind of a method would be used in this case. Since the problem doesn't make sense. $$q(t) = log (Q_t) = \frac{-1}{\sigma} log(\sigma i S_t) \\ \frac{dq(t)}{dt}=\dot q(t) = \frac{- \sigma i S_t}{\sigma^2 i} = \frac{- S_t}{\sigma }$$ So condition on $q(t)$ implies that $S_t = - \sigma i$. Which I believe there is a problem since $S_t <0$ Anyway : since $S_t <0$ at this specified time $t$ all the resources have varied off. If I ended up finding $S_t = 0$ then I would conclude that at this time $t$ all the speculators bought up the resource and since the resource was sold at the price $P^*$ somehow this would imply $Q_t = P^*$ But $S_t <0$ is the result we get. Which simply says that all the goods were bought plus government bought some goods. I think that implies a price $q(t)>P^*$ 

What is the relationship or difference between Nash and Coasian bargaining solutions? It is well-known that the Nash bargaining solution satisfies certain basic axioms. Which of these does the Coasian solution satisfy? Is the Nash solution applicable when there are externalities, and are the two solutions same/comparable in any sense? 

I was reading about the frequent congestion in US ports and the resulting effect on the US economy. I feel there are unique features to this setting. When ports face congestion, they levy charges, and these are transferred on to the buyers by the shippers. On top of this, costs of delayed reception of goods are also borne by the retailers only. The only 'catch' for ports arises if the congestion is so high that firms shift to air transport or reroute through a farther port and incur road transport expenses. Are there papers which model the economic interactions like competition between ports, or the interactions between firms, ports and labour unions? 

When the financial environment exceeds previous expectation. For example, if the US government announce a better fiscal quarter of inflation/housing prices, the market rallies up in response because everyone (not literally, but most of investors) expects stocks in hands will worth more in the future. The current market value increases. When there exist less worrisome threats. Basically, when the markets can safely be sure that the critical events have passed (the US financial crisis, ...), the market recovers. Business cycle can be of help here. 

A very weird question I agree. I am interested in understanding the motives behind firm behaviours of diversification. Why would some firms choose new target sectors/activities? Is there any difference between for profit and non-profit organisations, particularly those grassroots NGOs. I have read newspaper, sociological articles about their altruism, needs of the community they serve and so on. But, perhaps they are money-driven, they choose some activities where the money/funding goes. For example, if there is a huge wave funding for HIV prevention (Gates Foundation), there is a substantial number of newly registered NGOs. This case, in my opinion, should be distinguished with those organisations working on disaster relief (such as after 2004 Tsunami, 9/11 ...). But well, I still feel that NGOs now are not purely altruistic, they might shield their true motive under their brand. My questions are of economics and related literatures: 

The conditions 2 and 4 imply the condition 3 so no need to check for that. When taking derivatives with respect to $K$ I see that \begin{equation*} F_K = \alpha K^{\epsilon -1}(\alpha K^{\epsilon} + (1 - \alpha)Y^{\epsilon})^{\frac{1 - \epsilon}{\epsilon}} >0 \end{equation*} Which is positive. Now I need to show that $F_{KK}< 0$. See: \begin{equation*} F_{KK} = \alpha (\epsilon -1) K^{\epsilon -2}(\alpha K^{\epsilon} + (1 - \alpha)Y^{\epsilon})^{\frac{1 - \epsilon}{\epsilon}} + \alpha^2 K^{2\epsilon -2} \frac{1- \epsilon}{\epsilon} (\alpha K^{\epsilon} + (1- \alpha) L^{\epsilon})^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}-2} \end{equation*} However I couldn't find a way to decide on the sign of this expression. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks. 

That marginal products are positive and they are decreasing Inada conditions are satisfied Essentiality Linear homogeneity 

Say I'm given the production function of the form \begin{equation*} Y= F(K,L,A) = (\alpha K^{\epsilon} + (1 - \alpha)Y^{\epsilon})^{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} \end{equation*} Where $\epsilon, \alpha \in (0,1)$. Now I need to check three things: 

Now I have a data from an African country concerning (i) levels of corruption across public sectors and (ii) perceptions of service quality from households (bad, medium and high). The data consist two types of household: those who have used the public services and those who have NOT. I have read several papers from some respected journals (World Development, Journal of Development Economics) that address the problem of selectivity bias: those who have not engaged in public services might do so because they knew they would have to bribe (corruption) or they had bad experience from the past, and they would end up feeling bad. Authors from the papers, however, do not use Heckit models, that I have learned from my degree. Instead, they argue that by running two regressions: (i) using data on those who actually used the services and (ii) all households in the sample, regardless of the service usage. I feel this approach is not correct. I wish to understand further how selection bias, particularly in this example, should be handled. Some problems with the data are that the data might be subjective, quite small (around 500 households), and prone to measurement errors. Do you have any suggestions on dealing with the problems? Many thanks. 

The classical definition of Price of anarchy is the ratio of decentralised optimal utility to the centralised optimal utility. This concept is used to quantify how inefficient is it when agents behave selfishly, in comparison with a situation where a central planner takes optimal actions. My question: why cannot Price of anarchy be defined as the difference between the two solutions? In my setting, I have a number of log based functions in the utilities. For example, in a network setting defined on a graph $G$, the central planner's utility function is $U_s=f_s(G)+\sum_i \log(l_i)$ and the individual firm's utility is $U_i=f_i(G)+\log(l_i)$, where $l_i$ are loss terms for node $i$. Having a difference as PoA helps me eliminate idiosyncratic losses and I am left with $f_s(G)-\sum_i f_i(G)$, and I have a means to compare dependence of PoA on network structure. I am greatly benefited by having a difference in place of ratio. Is it fine to define that way? Is there some other term for the difference? 

Suppose the government pegs an exhaustible resource, at a price $P^*$. I found out that the shadow price (initial price of the resource if government didn't peg) would be $$Q_t = ( \sigma i S_t )^\frac{-1}{\sigma}$$. Where $S_t$ is the resources left after time $t$. And $\sigma$ is a parameter, whereas $i$ is the interest rate. I'm trying to show that if $q(t) = ln Q_t$ and $ \triangle q(t) = i$ (change in q(t)) Then $$Q_t = P^*$$ 

I want to analyze the changes in the interest rate $r$ when dealing with the permanent income hypothesis. First of all, $r$ is the interest rate $0<\beta<1$ is the discount factor, $Y_t$ is the labor income for period $t$, $A_t$ is the net asset wealth, $C_t$ is the consumption in the period $t$. Now the Euler equation comes up : $$u'(C_t)=\beta(1+r)u'(C_{t+1}) \ \ (*)$$ And If we assume $\beta(1+r)=1$ (We are going to be assuming this all the time when we are doing our analysis (closed economy)). Then: Consumption in each period equals to each other (derived from the Euler equation) and it is equal to : $$C = \frac{r}{1+r}(A_0+\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} (\frac{1}{1+r})^t Y_t ) \ \ (**)$$ I'm not gonna go through the details of how the equation $(**)$ is derived, since it will distort the scope of my question here. Now Clearly It could be observed that when the interest rate $r$ increases, we use the $eq(*)$ to identify the substation effect and $eq(**)$ to identify the income effect. Substitution effect could be identified easily by using the fact that $u''()<0$ However when identifying the income effect there are two cases : $(1)$ Consumer is saving $(2)$ Consumer is borrowing When looking at the case $(2)$ I could easily show that consumers that are borrowing will decrease their consumption for all periods if the interest rates increase (Intuition = formula) However if Consumer is saving: Then $A_0 >0$ So $$ A_0 \frac{r_2}{1+r_2} > A_0 \frac{r_1}{1+r_1}$$ Where $r_2$ is the new interest rate. However, We need to look at the change that occurs for $\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} (\frac{1}{1+r})^t Y_t$ when the interest rate increases. However this decreases with a higher $r$. Since the change in $A_0 \frac{r}{1+r}$ and $\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} (\frac{1}{1+r})^t Y_t$ act in opposite directions, I couldn't show whether $C$ would decrease or increase. (i.e I couldn't show that $intuition = formula$) Any help?
