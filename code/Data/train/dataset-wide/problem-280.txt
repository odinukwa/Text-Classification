There is a society with a similar level of technological and cultural advancements as what we have. But there are no police officers. No government entities dedicated to investigating and punishing violations of the law. No prisons. No notion of a criminal court system. Law enforcement as we know it does not exist. What kind of governments and social norms would give rise to such a society? What forms would crime take, if it even exists? This is not a post-apocalyptic scenario, unless the catastrophe happened so long ago that society has essentially been rebuilt. Law enforcement simply doesn't exist as a distinct function of the government. You can ignore the question of whether a military exists. 

I think that situation 4 is the likeliest. Lab tests are going to leave some trace of the prior experiment, and any discovery this momentous would have involved a lot of documentation. There would also have been lots of lab tests (probably on very short-lived animals) to make sure that this drug is the real deal. So in some way or another, the company learns about the drug, even if just one guy is behind it. So the company knows. But just "who" in the company knows about this? It's not just going to be one or two people outside the team; there will be a lot of personnel involved. I'd expect the top executives would try to take control of the drug. They won't want anyone stealing their secrets. They won't release this to the public because they'd have the idea stolen, and they'd lose any bargaining power they had. Would the CIA have found out? Well, sooner or later, some safety inspector from the government is going to walk into the laboratory and find . . . nothing. The executives are going to do everything in their power to hide this thing, even from the government. They most likely have large amounts of money at their disposal, and they can do behind-the-scenes work while making sure that the government doesn't get suspicious. Actually, this might not be the case. This would be a fairly large cover-up. If somebody has found a formula for immortality while working at a company, the company will discover it, which means that more workers will learn about it, which means that matters will quickly get very complicated. All it would take is for one person to talk to an outsider. If this scenario happens - many people within the company learn about it - then the cat could be out of the bag. This cover-up might be really, really difficult, if not impossible, assuming that someone else within the company learns of the formula's existence. Going at it from another angle, why keep the drug secret? After all, the only way to make money off of this is to reveal it to someone. At this point, though, the executives aren't interested in making money off of this. They'll conduct many tests (on animals, probably, although I wouldn't put it past it to test it on willing human volunteers) before taking the drug themselves, imbibing it and then destroying any evidence of its existence. The profit here is immortality, not money. That's the only way they could profit. 

The US has essentially threatened military action against Iran if they block oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz, and has no problem ignoring warnings to keep bombers away from artificial Chinese islands, so it's no stretch to say that weapons would be drawn in order to keep exports from stopping completely. Hopefully there would be some sort of transition period during which China agrees to (rapidly) ramp down exports rather than cutting them off cold turkey, which should help avert open warfare. Economic sanctions wouldn't work; they're already refusing to sell stuff to you. But it would be hard to define what "China" is for the purposes of this question. Are we only considering products made by wholly Chinese-owned companies? Then the global impact would not be much. But many western companies (not just Apple) have operations in China. If the Chinese government blocks or seizes those other companies' assets, then things would get complicated. In any case, what the OP is asking about would almost unquestionably be seen as an act of aggression. Edit: It would be interesting to see how China then intends to get back the $1.3 trillion owed to it by the US, as well as other countries' debt. Do they simply write it off? Are they self-sufficient so they can survive without imports (how will they pay for them? Money generated by purely domestic ventures?)? This would be a sticky situation for the Chinese as well. 

This method of hydrogen production was first specifically used for airships in the 18th century, in a time of technology even less advanced than your steampunk civilization - and at the time, hydrogen was not yet known to exist! It seems quite plausible that they could produce the gas in large quantities. 

Asimov's laws of robotics are not technical laws; they're societal laws, imposed by humans to ensure that robots don't destroy mankind. You can make a robot that breaks any of them, still using ordinary computer chips, although really, the laws as they are are just fine, thank you very much. Silicon, transistors, and (even) vacuum tubes are not limited by them, and quantum computers don't have any advantages in that department. While they are better than normal computers in many regards, including speed, they're not any better in the way you're thinking. Having a qubit in a superposition of states gives you no advantage here. How quantum computing differs from normal computing: 

If your creature exists in higher dimensions, it might be able to just pluck the star out of our own dimension, like a 3-D being can lift a 2-D being off a sheet of paper. This avoids the problems you would have with conventional physics if such an enormous creature tried to eat a star in our regular three dimensions. It would also be extremely disruptive to anything that was previously in its gravity well, like inhabited planets, which may or may not work for your story's plot. 

If the government knows a year ahead of time, they have time to shape society so that telling other people is either unfeasible (other people are too far away, you don't have adequate communications technology, etc.), or you just don't care enough about other people to tell them. You state that the chosen ones are notified one day prior, but the government should have been planning for months ahead of time. If the world is going to end, and you have no qualms about making things start to go downhill early, start your own little dystopia just to get the chosen ones in the right mindset. Tank the economy. Quadruple the rate of pollution. Cut off funding for all but the most basic life-sustaining services. Sabotage any high-tech infrastructure people can use to get the word out. Pretty soon, your chosen ones will be so disillusioned with the world they're living in that they won't want to tell others about their ticket out. 

This machine would be handy in a world where the environment is constantly changing, with otherwise dire effects on the population. 

I recently came across Could pulsars really act as "lighthouses" to help in interstellar travel?, asked a week ago. The author was trying to figure out if pulsars could be useful for interstellar FTL travel, because they could be used to find a craft's position; the answer was, of course, yes. I had some reservations, though. My main issue was that it seems, from an engineering standpoint, not very feasible. Here's my thought process: 

When will the planet break apart? A solid body will break up if the centrifugal force at a point is equal to the gravitational force. At Earth's equator, the equation becomes $$\frac{GM_{\oplus}}{R_e^2}=\omega^2R_e$$ where $M_{\oplus}$ is the mass of Earth, $R_e$ is its equatorial radius, and $\omega$ is its angular speed. Rearranging and solving for $\omega$ gets $$\omega=\sqrt{\frac{GM_{\oplus}}{R_e^3}}$$ Assuming $R_e\approx\bar{R}_{\oplus}$, its mean radius, we have $$\omega=1.24\times10^{-3}\text{ rad s}^{-1}$$ Earth's current angular velocity is approximately $\omega=7.29\times10^{-5}\text{ rad s}^{-1}$. This is almost exactly 1/17th of Earth's breakup speed. Now, this assumes that $R_e$ doesn't change with $\omega$ - which it does. In fact, the equatorial bulge is $$R_e=R_p+\frac{5}{4}\frac{\omega^2\bar{R}_{\oplus}^4}{GM_{\oplus}}$$ At the original breakup speed, we have $$R_e=6.356\times10^6+\frac{5}{4}\frac{(1.24\times10^{-3})^2(6.371\times10^6)^4}{6.673\times10^{-11}\times6\times10^{24}}=1.43\times10^{7}\text{ m}=2.24\bar{R}_{\oplus}$$ This decreases the gravity by a factor of roughly 5, so the breakup speed is actually a bit lower. So at 100 or 1000 times its current rotation speed, Earth wouldn't be here. The Coriolis force The maximum magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration is $$|\mathbf{a}_c|_{\text{max}}=2|\mathbf{\Omega}||\mathbf{v}|$$ where $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is the rotational velocity, and $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of a particular particle. This means that the force scales linearly with $|\mathbf{\Omega}|$, and thus can only be 17 times as large as it is right now, at a given point on Earth. We'd see Rossby numbers (which characterize how much a system is affected by Coriolis forces) lower by no more than a factor of 17. As Anoplexian noted, this would lead to stronger winds and likely stronger hurricanes - although nothing catastrophic; an order of magnitude change here won't be devastating. I wouldn't be too concerned. Daily life At 17 times the Earth's current rotation speed, each day would last about 45 minutes, and each night would last about 45 minutes. Even at 12 hours per day-night cycle, you have to worry about humans getting the proper amount of deep sleep each cycle. 45 minutes is enough for a nice catnap, but not good sleep. I'd assume that creatures would either adapt to such a short sleep cycle, or sleep through several days and nights, and then spend several days and nights asleep. Whether or not either of these is feasible is something I'll have to look into; I'm not overly optimistic. 

If there is no more communication from the aliens, and the weapon cannot be tested short of actually blowing up the world, how do governments know the schematics are legit? It would be interesting to see if it devolves into a climate change-type argument between scientists and naysayers. That aside, absolutely huge amounts of resources will be poured into researching how to mitigate damage caused by the bomb. You've basically told everyone that they can die at any time, anywhere, more certainly than anyone during the Cold War could have dreamed, and that no form of shelter ever devised (or that can be devised within the next few decades) can protect you. Every other military/political/economic/social conflict pales in comparison. Martial law will be imposed immediately and any facilities capable of preparing this bomb will be seized by the government. Ironically, nations that are open about their nuclear capabilities will probably be left alone because they are assumed to be somewhat responsible enough not to mess with the weapon. On the other hand, nations that like to tease nuclear threats, like North Korea and even Israel, will be under extreme pressure to publicly declare their nuclear capabilities, if they aren't invaded outright. 

Ahh, here we go. No. But yes. I'll leave the stuff about the Roche limit for Vincent; after all, it was his idea. Assuming he writes up an answer, you'll learn why these planets cannot be tidally locked and so near each other. This means that you won't see two planets coming really close to each other, like this image depicts. They certainly won't touch. But atmospheric transfer is totally possible. I know, this seems counterintuitive, given that it's just been established that these planets can be so close to one another. But there's a little loophole called a Roche lobe that can make this scenario possible. The Roche lobe (not the same as the Roche limit!) is the point in a binary star system inside of which matter is bound to the star by gravity. If matter escapes the lobe, it may be accreted by the other star, and vice versa. Mass transfer is usually in the form of gas, plasma, or other stellar material, including material from coronal mass ejections or other dramatic events. Here, though, it will be the atmosphere that is transferred. The whole idea, by the way, is explored in Robert Forward's Rocheworld, which I managed to find out after writing the rest of this answer.
