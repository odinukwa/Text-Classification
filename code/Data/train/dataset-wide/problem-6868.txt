Well it depends on what you call a forecast. Considering that there is a large uncountable number of people who are called (or call themselves) financial,economic and policy analysts all over the world who together make what one would think millions of forecasts made everyday, there is probably a number which fail and a number which succeed. So where are the numbers on it? I would suspect no general statistic exists because its measurement does not have a practical use from a policy perspective. I say this in the sense, that it is a concern exclusively of private businesses and companies to care how well their forecasts work. providing statistics on their forecasting success would be exclusively for marketing purposes. 

It seems unlikely that any authoritative source would consider credit card points, airline miles or store credit as apart of M2 money supply. As you have probably read on investopedia: 

This being said, its inappropriate to measure productivity on the basis of knowledge of phonics and algebra as these are studies which are only prerequisites of more prerequisites for another subject with labour market implications. Hope this helps 

1. Mathematically this statement can be written as: $$\mathbb{E}_m(X_t|\phi_{t-1})=\mathbb{E}(X_t|\phi_{t-1})$$ where the expected value given by the market of $X_t$ conditional on $\phi_{t-1}$ the set of all available information at time $t-1$, is equal to the true expected value of $X_t$ It follows logically that $\mathbb{E}[X_t-\mathbb{E}_m(X_t)|\phi_{t-1}]=0$ 2. a Youtube series he prodouced on rational expectations $URL$ 

where $x_1$ is Income and $y$ is a binary variable which indicates In cases (1) and (2) I have statistical significance at the 1% level ( *** ), but in regression (3)I have no significance at all in these variables. How do I remedy/ interpret this? 

Google Finance and Yahoo Finance are both sites which provide free information on Stock prices and their variables. I prefer google as it is easier to use, but both sites are pretty good. 

A Hicksian demand curve indicates how much of a good will be demanded given price holding level of overall utility fixed. When in equilibrium with a supply curve we end up with this area we would call consumer surplus, however we can no longer interpret it as "income saved by the consumer with respect to his actual demand" which is an appropriate interpretation when marshallian demands are used. How exactly do we interpret this type of consumer surplus? 

A system is explosive if its coefficients are non-stationary. Stationary is an important property to have in dynamic models as it tells us that an equilibrium value is obtainable (which is important in finding the BGP). If your system is explosive no equilibrium (and BGP) exists. In your example where you have the equality: $$k_t-k^* \simeq \lambda^t (k_0-k^*)$$ If $\lambda\le1$, then as time progresses ($t=1,2,...,n$) the impact of a policy change approaches a new equilibrium and BGP. However if $\lambda>1$ then your system is explosive and equilibrium will not be reached, thus making the system unsolvable as $t$ tends to $\infty$. 

The production $$f(x_i,...,x_n)=\min\{x_i,...,x_n\}$$ is pretty straight forward and usually with smaller size data sets and can usually be picked up on rather quickly in an intuitive sense. However if one has a very large set of data with a firm that produces $n$ products, how does one go about analyzing the production process and say that such a relationship exists in production of a given good? 

When being exposed to your equations for profit maximization you have an equation of: $$\pi=pf(x)-c(x)$$ with this you can solve for the optimal input(s) $x$ from the first order conditions and some basic algebra. I was wondering why in consumer theory we don't solve for the bundle that maximizes consumer surplus using a similar type of formula. The motive behind this question is that if such a formula exists it would simplify the calculations for utility maximization in consumer theory. The profit function is convenient because it incorporates the constraint, however we can't seem to do this in consumer theory. Why does such a function not exist? Edit: I'm interested in understanding why we don't have a function which circumvents the use of the Lagrangian in consumer theory. I.e. Why don't we solve to maximize consumer surplus 

This part of the question I recommend for Politics SE as it is more political than economic. Hope this helps 

Recall the profit function. $$\pi=pf(x)-wx$$ where $x$ is a set of inputs, and $w$ is a set of input prices. A firm is profit maximizing when $MC=MR$ or in a competitive case where $MC=p$. If a worker is paid his marginal product (where $MPL=w$) we only pay what he produces. If marginal cost is constant and marginal revenues are constant across all production sets, then the firms profits will be zero. However if there are diminishing returns from the inputs then every worker is paid less, thus allowing for profits to exist in the short run. Bottom line: In the short run, through the diminishing returns from labor that profit for the firm comes into existence. In the long run however, new firms enter capturing more and more of the profits until they are reduced to zero. 

An AR(1) process is given as: $$x_t=\rho_0+\rho_{t-1}x_{t-1}+\epsilon_t$$ This regression tells us that $x_{t}$ is a function of its value at time $t-1$. My question is, how do you interpret its coefficient $\rho_{t-1}$? by comparison in a labor economics example (where only cross sectional data is used) for a case where you regress education on wage. $$y_{wage}=\beta_0+\beta_{1} x_{educ}+u$$ If I were to take partials of this regression with respect to $x_{educ}$ I can interpret $\beta_1$ as the marginal returns to wage from education. In the AR(1) process, following the same steps as before, I am not sure how to interpret the coefficient $\rho_{t-1}$. What is its meaning? 

I've been working with some historical macroeconomic data of the Canadian economy and am having difficulty empirically testing the Phillips curve long run and short run versions. I got the data from FRED, logged the variables and then plotted them. The results are unsatisfactory; the scatter plot I have is: A shape which is looking like a bow, going up right and then back. I tried using fitting the data using a loess curve again yielding unsatisfactory results. Im probably not doing something right as the data does not seem to fit with either the short run or long run versions of what the Phillips curve represents. So to offically crown myself as conspiracy theorist of the day on Economics.SE (which is probably a problem for a mod): Does this analysis disprove both the long run and short run Phillips curve? *for Canada? ** what is incorrect in this analysis? 

Does this (the bolded statement) mean that we essentially convert our consumer's budget constraint/budget line into his indifference curves when prices are fixed? 

Knowing that: $$\frac{\Delta PCI}{PCI}= \left(\frac{∆\frac{Y}{P}}{\frac{Y}P}\right) $$ If we rearrange the terms on the right hand side: $$\frac{\Delta PCI}{PCI}=\left(\frac{\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}\right)$$ In order to get your last equation we would have to log the variables, for logged growth rates. This makes things easier because we can think of the variables in terms of percentages. Logging the variables we get $$\ln\left(\frac{\Delta PCI}{PCI}\right)=\ln\left(\frac{\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}}{\frac{\Delta P}{P}}\right)$$ $$\ln\left(\frac{\Delta PCI}{PCI}\right)=\ln\left(\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}\right)-\ln\left(\frac{\Delta P}{P}\right)$$ in more formal notation used in macroeconomics: $$\hat{PCI}=\hat{y}-\hat{p}$$ hope this helps. 

I'd recommend ADVANCED MACROECONOMICS Fourth Edition by David Romer. Its a textbook for advanced macroeconomics, however it covers the topics in a very precise way. Id recommend reading chapters 1 in order to review the basic Solow model and then chapter 3 to see how the model changes when accounting for human capital and endogenous technological growth. Hope this helps. 

This answer is partly from HRSE in his answer to Are monotonic and continuous preferences necessarily rational? I'm posting this as an answer for a more technical definition. Rationality Rationality consist of the following properties: Completeness 

Elasticity of subsitution ($\sigma$) can be found by using this formula $$\sigma=\frac{dln(\frac{x_1}{x_2})}{dln(MRS)}$$ alternatively you can use: $$\sigma=\frac{e(x)f(x)f_1(x)f_2(x)}{x_1x_2|BH|}$$ where $x=x_1,x_2......x_n$ and $e(x)$ is elasticity of scale. You can use this information to solve your problem. 

In my own studies I have noticed that many of the constrained optimization type questions that are often covered in intermediate/advanced microeconomics courses are seldom seen in more empirical types of work. under what circumstances would I apply the use of the Legrangian multiplier to an real world problem? 

Your supervisor wants you to do this because its based on the fisher equation. $$i =r+\pi$$ where $i$ is nominal interest rate, $r$ is real interest rate and $\pi$ is inflation rate. rearranging this equation we get the basis for your supervisors recommendation. $$r=i-\pi$$ Hope this helps. 

The quantity theory of money is stated as a simple equation which states that the general price level of goods and services is directly proportional to the amount of money in circulation. This is written as: $$\text{MV}=\text{PQ}$$ I got interested in testing this relationship econometric relationship however found that this neat equation got alot messier more complected in applied work using VARs and the like to test it.(1) How can such a simple equation be presented? Any help would be appreciated. 

Im working on college enrollment linear probability model where enrollment is regressed on income. I have the following regressions 

Im unable to identify the appropriate model (AR,MA,ARMA ect.) since the use ACF and the PACF is not possible since i lack data for 2013. How would i deal with such an issue? (preferably using R) 

ARIMA models, from what I know, are atheoretical models in the sense that they don't provide us with meaningful economic interpretation of a process. However in population forecasting, can ARIMA models be interpreted in a meaningful way? i.e. 

In order to have unbiased estimates you require that all of these conditions hold. In your case it is very much possible that you can have a non-random sample that does not violate the fourth assumption. However your estimates will be off because of the non-random sampling , so though you dont have any problems which like endogeneity when MLR.4 is violated, you will end up with estimates which do not accurately represent the influence of variables on the subject in question (because of the violation of MLR.2). In your example you will end up with accurate estimates for the men but not for the women based on the fulfillment of MLR.2. 

What data and models should I be running to identify liquidity traps? I'm interested in seeing some of the theory which money market models and the IS-LM present. 

The reason why elasticity is not defined as the slope of the graph is because the idea of slope is mathematically different from elasticity. When we calculate slope we use the formula ${\triangle}y/{\triangle}x$ however in the case of elasticity we use $\frac{{\triangle}y/y}{{\triangle}x/x}$ which is the percent change in $y$ divided by percent change in $x$ which is not the same as the formula for slope. Bottom Line: ${\triangle}y/{\triangle}x \ne \frac{{\triangle}y/y}{{\triangle}x/x}$ Hope this helps. 

Are there certifications or professional designations that are specifically geared for economists? i.e much like the CPA and CA exists for accountants. 

*Though there is what to say on marshallian and hicksian demands I'll leave that for others to fill in. 

What phenomenon is this cost function coming to describe? Is there an example of what this cost function represents? 

The Solow model was indeed the first model to account for technological progress. While models like the the Harrod-Domar model and the Neo-Marxian Feldman–Mahalanobis model conciser investment and saving as contributors to economic growth, they don't consider any measure of technology like total factor productivity to contribute to economic growth, like the Solow Residual. 

I came across the answer to the validity of univariate modelling in economics (albet indirectly) from the book called A Rational Expectations Approach to Macroeconometrics. This answer is based on the material in the book, for a better understanding I reccomend actually going through it. 

The only difference between consumer and capital goods is whether or not the good in question is purchased by a firm or a consumer. The practical implications of this is whether or not this expenditure is included in $I$ or $C$ of the GDP equation. Investopedia defines $I$ as: "the sum of all the country's investment, including businesses capital expenditures" Going into detail on "capital expenditure": 

Yes. Anyone who utilizes their privately owned property or assets as a means of production for the sake of profit is a capitalist. In this case the farmer's capital is the land which they use for agricultural production.

Also remember most general interest economic journals also publish articles that deal with welfare economics/public finance issues. Hope this list helps 

Given the large amount of commentary on the state of the economy, I've found that most of the time the theme of the articles are always that there is something wrong/ abnormal with regards to the economy.There seems to be call for change of policy all the time. With all this noise its often difficult to know when a "business as usual" policy should be implemented (i.e nothing should be changed or advanced). When is it possible that we should change nothing in an macroeconomy (i.e no changes in interest rates, domestic taxes or trade taxes)? What properties would a country with a stable economy posess? 

According to this definition, credit card points are not counted to as apart of M2 money because they are not directly tied back to a cash exchange directly,(though there are some firms who will purchase them,) but are tied to specific services provided by the authorizing firms. Since Credit card points are only usable for a specific services and are viewed as "in kind" transfers rather than actual money. 

In economics, we commonly use the formula for GDP as a Indicator of "economic growth" The GDP formula is: GDP=C+G+I+NX Where C is equal to all private consumption, or consumer spending, in a nation's economy, G is the sum of government spending, I is the sum of all the country's investment, including businesses capital expenditures and NX is the nation's total net exports, calculated as total exports minus total imports (NX = Exports - Imports). Notice how we can have an increase in GDP by increased consumption or government spending. So technically we can see economic growth without any investment in structure (which would be represented by an increase in I) from a mathematical perspective. Note how this is a static measurement of economic activity, which we cannot make any predictions regarding the future. However you may want to look at the Solow-Swan Model regarding economic growth with capital accumulation and technological change. Hope this helps.
