Assuming the assertions your claim are true, it follows that $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$ is generated by 2 elements for all $n$; for $n$ odd (your missing case), the matrices $-s_1,s_3$ indeed generate $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$. This follows from the following three facts: 1) Let $p$ be prime and $C_p=\langle c\rangle$ the cyclic group of order $p$. If $G$ is an arbitrary group with $\mathrm{Hom}(G,C_p)=0$, and if $G$ is generated by $k\ge 1$ elements, then so is $G\times C_p$. Proof: if $g_1,\dots,g_k$ generate $G$, then $(g_1,c),(g_2,1)\dots,(g_k,1)$ generate $G\times C_p$. Indeed they generate a group projecting onto both factors and hence if by contradiction it's a proper subgroup, this subgroup defines the graph of an isomorphism between some quotient of $G$ with $C_p$, contradiction. 2) for all $n\neq 2$, $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$ is perfect and in particular $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{Z}),C_2)=0$. Proof: this is obvious for $n\le 1$ and for $n\ge 3$ it's generated by the elementary matrices $e_{ij}$, $i\neq j$, each of which being a commutator, namely $e_{ij}=[e_{ik},e_{kj}]$ for some $k\notin\{i,j\}$. 3) If $n$ is odd then $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{Z})\simeq\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{Z})\times C_2$, where $C_2$ corresponds to $\{\pm I_n\}$. 

Say that $G$ is $n$-CO (for "conjugation-oligomorphic") if $G$ has finitely many orbits on $G^n$ by diagonal conjugation $g\cdot (g_1,\dots,g_n)=(gg_1g^{-1},\dots)$. (Clearly this implies $(n-1)$-CO). Say that $G$ is CO if it is $n$-CO for all $n$. Define ACO in the same way, but for the action of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$. So $n$-CO implies $n$-ACO and CO implies ACO. (ACO is better known as "$\aleph_0$-categorical" or "$\omega$-categorical".) (1) If $G$ is 1-ACO then torsion elements in $G$ have bounded order. (2) If $G$ is 2-ACO then $G$ is torsion (because if $g$ is non torsion, the pairs $(g,g^n)$, for $n\ge 2$, are in distinct orbits for the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$. In particular, in combination with (1), 2-ACO implies torsion of bounded exponent. (3) (generalization of 2): if $G$ is $(n+1)$-ACO, then $n$-generated subgroups of $G$ are (uniformly) finite: indeed if $(g_1,\dots,g_n)\in G^n$, then the $(g_1,\dots,g_n,h)$, for $h$ ranging over elements of the subgroup $\langle g_1,\dots,g_n\rangle$ are in distinct orbits of $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$. In particular, if $G$ is ACO then $G$ is locally finite. (4) If $G$ is $n$-CO (or CO), then so is every finite index normal subgroup $H$ of $G$ (because transitive $G$-actions have finitely many $H$-orbits, and this applies to the $G$-action on $H^n$). (5) If $G$ is 1-CO then $G$ has finitely many normal subgroups. In particular, it has a unique minimal subgroup of finite index $G^\sharp$. If $G$ is $n$-CO (or CO) then so is $G^\sharp$ (by (4)). (6) If $G$ is $n$-CO (or CO) then so is every quotient of $G$. If $G\neq 1$ then (by (5)) it has a maximal normal proper subgroup, and hence a simple quotient (which is thus $n$-CO or CO as well). (7) By (5) and (6), if $G$ is infinite and $n$-CO (or CO), then $G$ has a subquotient $H$ that is an infinite simple group with $n$-CO (or CO). (8) If $G$ is infinite CO (or $n$-CO) then $G$ has an infinite countable subgroup $H$ that is CO (or $n$-CO). [Let us check only the case of CO, the others are slightly easier. Start with any infinite countable subgroup $H_0$. Enlarging $H_0$ allows to assume that for every $n$, every $n$-tuple in $G^n$ is conjugate to some finite subset $X_n$ of $n$-tuples contained in $H_0^n$. Next, we use that for every countable subgroup $L$ and $n$, adding countably many elements embeds $L$ in a countable subgroup $M$ such that all $n$-tuples in $L^n$ are conjugate by $M$ to an $n$-tuple in $X_n$. Then we use this for $n=1$ to $H_0$ to get $H_0\subset H_1$, then to $H_1$ and $n=2$, etc: every $n$-tuple in $H_{n-1}$ is conjugate in $H_n$ to an element in $X_n$. In particular, it follows that $H_\infty=\bigcup H_n$ is CO: indeed if $(g_1,\dots,g_n)\in H_\infty^n$, it belongs to $H_{m-1}^n$ for $m$ large enough, say $m\ge n$. Then the $m$-tuple $(g_1,\dots,g_n,1,\dots,1)$ belongs to $H_{m-1}^m$ and hence is conjugate by $H_m$ (and thus by $G$) to an element of $X_m$. Assuming (as we can that $X_n\times\{1\}^{n-m}$ is contained in $X_m$ for all $n\le m$, we deduce that $(g_1,\dots,g_n)$ is conjugate by $H_\infty$ to an element of $X_n$.] Now I will use some known results: (9) If $G$ is locally finite, simple and locally solvable, then $G$ is not simple (unless $G$ is cyclic of prime order). See Corollary 3.5 here (original references welcome!). (10) If $G$ is a countable, characteristically simple group, locally finite group of finite exponent, then either (a) $G$ is a $p$-group for some prime $p$, or (b) $G$ has the form $B(S),B^-(S),P(S)$ for some finite nonabelian simple group $S$. (Reference: ) Here $P(S)$ is the restricted direct product of countably many copies of $S$, $B(S)$ is the group of continuous functions $K\to S$ ($K$ the Cantor set), and $B^-(S)$ is the subgroup of $B(S)$ of those functions vanishing at some $x_0\in K$.

Press, Cambridge-New York, 1982. (Remark: I found this reference in a Google search on locally finite groups of finite exponent; anyway it's not just a coincidence if it lands on a study of $\aleph_0$-categorical groups, as suggested by Julien Melleray.) [Additional reference (including a proof of Wilson's result): A.B. Apps, On the structure of $\aleph_0$-categorical groups, Journal of Algebra Volume 81, Issue 2, April 1983, Pages 320-339. (Sciencedirect link)] The groups in (10)(b) are not CO, not even 1-CO (because the support is conjugation invariant). From (9) and (10) we get (11) There is no infinite countable simple locally finite group of finite exponent. Using (8) and then (7), if there is an infinite CO-group, then there is one that is in addition simple, and is locally finite by (3). With (11), this leads to a contradiction. (Remark: possibly following Wilson's arguments can lead to a more direct proof, without this business to pass to a countable subgroup, when we assume simplicity instead of characteristic simplicity. I haven't yet been through the proof, only relying on a partially scanned Google version.) 

Denoting by $C_k$ a cyclic group of order $k$, the wreath product $\mathbf{Z}\wr C_k=\mathbf{Z}^k\rtimes C_k$ is 2-generated (hence $d$-generated for any $d\ge 2$) and has isoperimetric dimension (in the above sense) $k$. It's likely that the "isoperimetric dimension" is finite only for f.g. groups with polynomial growth. In this case the computation is not easy and might (?) give rise to non-integral values. I do not know whether the terminology "$d$-dimensional isoperimetric inequality" is motivated by any example beyond the Euclidean setting. A natural question is whether it can be greater than the polynomial degree of growth. The results of Breuillard and Le Donne about volumes of spheres might suggest it can be greater if the nilpotency length is greater than 2. 

Yes, some quotients of the 3-sphere are examples. Namely, view $S^3$ as the group of quaternions of unit one. Consider two finite subgroups $F_1,F_2$ of $S^3$, with $F_1$ not abelian, and $F_2$ cyclic of odd prime order $p$ not dividing the order of $F_1$. So $F_1\times F_2$ acts freely on the sphere by $(g,h)\cdot z=gzh^{-1}$. I claim that the quotient $X=F_1\backslash S^3/F_2$ is not homeomorphic to a homogeneous space of any connected Lie group $G$. Assume the contrary. First, by a result of Montgomery (Proc AMS 1950), any maximal compact subgroup of $G$ acts transitively (it's a general fact, using only that $X$ has finite fundamental group). So we can assume that $G$ is compact. Then a result of Montgomery-Samelson (Annals 1943) tells us that some simple $S$ subgroup acts transitively. (The result concerns actions on spheres, and is applied by considering the action of a finite covering of $G$ on $S^3$.) The isometry group of a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold is at most 6-dimensional, and the only simple compact Lie group of dimension at most 6 is $SO(3)$ (and its universal covering). Thus $X=S^3/F$ for some finite subgroup $F$ of $S^3$, isomorphic to $F_1\times F_2$. But in $S^3$, the centralizer of any nontrivial element of odd order is abelian. This is a contradiction. These examples are not simply connected, of course. It seems that the other answers deal with the much more delicate simply connected case. 

Here are many 3-dimensional examples: Consider the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_D=\mathfrak{a}_1\ltimes_D\mathfrak{a}_2$, where $\mathfrak{a}_i$ is an $i$-dimensional Lie algebra (with a basis) and the action is given by some derivation $D$. (1) If $D$ is diagonal with $D_{11}=1$, then this Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_D$ is the Lie algebra of an algebraic group if and only of $D_{22}$ is rational. (2) If $D=\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\ 0 & 1\end{pmatrix}$ then $\mathfrak{g}_D$ is not algebraic either (this one, unlike the previous one, does not have the property that the image of the adjoint representation is stable under taking Jordan decomposition). From (1) one sees a funny phenomenon: while there are uncountably many real (or complex, or $p$-adic) non-isomorphic 3-dimensional Lie algebras, only countably many are Lie algebras of some algebraic group. (If I'm correct, the latter holds up to dimension $6$.) 

I have checked some families of examples I can discard. First, the result is true when $G$ is abelian, or more generally nilpotent, and even more generally when $G$ has a normal 2-Sylow. Second, having in mind that $G$ has even order, the result is very easy when $|G|=2$ (mod 4) and is also true when $|G|=4$ (mod 8). This reduces to the case when 8 divides $|G|$. Third, I also checked it when $|G|=2^np$ with $p$ prime. The first values for $|G|$ that are not covered are thus $72=8\times 9$, $120=8\times15$, $144=16\times9$... A simple argument also shows that a minimal counterexample has no nontrivial normal subgroup of odd order. I also do not know in the case when $G/Z$ is simple. To discard the first few cases, for $G=\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{F}_q)$, $q$ odd prime power, which has center of order 2, the center is not a direct factor in the 2-Sylow since $-I_2$ is square of an element of order 4.
