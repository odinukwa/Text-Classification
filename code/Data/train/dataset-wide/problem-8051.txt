Are these categories related in any nontrivial manner that gives merit to the terminology? If not, is there some other reason why the stable module category deserves to be called stable? (Mind you, this sounds like it might have a higher-categorical answer, and my knowledge of higher category theory is very sketchy... so do be gentle if that's the direction your answer is taking!) 

Here's the long of it: I really want to swim in the Kool-Aid fountain of deformation theory and taste of its sweet, sweet purple love, but I'm having trouble. When I wanted to learn about K-theory, I learned about it through the solution to the Hopf invariant one problem, the solution to the vector fields on spheres problem, and through the Adams conjecture. When I wanted to learn some equivariant stuff, it was nice to have the solution to the Kervaire invariant one problem as a guiding force. I have trouble learning things in a bubble; I need at least a slight push. Now, I know that deformation theory is useful for building moduli spaces, but the trouble is that, aside from the ones that appear in homotopy theory, I haven't fully submerged in this sea of goodness either. The exception would be any example of a strict application that used deformation theory to construct some moduli space and then used this space to prove some tasty fact. To give you all an idea, here are the only examples I have found (from asking around) that fit my criteria: 

The first answer to your question is no. There are many acyclic spaces with nonvanishing $\pi_1$. Since generalized homology is a stable invariant, and the suspension of an acyclic space is contractible (exercise), this also means that any generalized cohomology theory vanishes on such a space. For an explicit example, take the classifying space of a perfect group. But now you'll say it's a $\pi_1$ issue, and that's sort of true. If $E_n(X) =0$ for every generalized homology theory, then that means that $E_*(X) = 0$ for any generalized homology theory, including ordinary homology. Indeed: if $E_*(-)$ is a homology theory, so is $E_{*+n}$. But if you're willing to stick to, say, connective cohomology theories (i.e. $E_k(pt) = 0$ for $k<0$), then there are simply connected counterexamples. Indeed: $\pi_3S^2 = \mathbb{Z}$ but $H_3(S^2) = 0$. So let $X = S^2_{\mathbb{Q}}$ denote the rationalization of the 2-sphere, then for any homology theory $E$ with $E_{-1} \otimes \mathbb{Q} = 0$ we get $E_3(X) = 0$ but $\pi_3X = \mathbb{Q}$. Indeed, $\Sigma^{\infty}_+X$ is just $\Sigma^2H\mathbb{Q}$ so $E_3(X) = \pi_{-1}(H\mathbb{Q} \wedge E) = 0$. 

In Bott & Tu's marvelous book there is a derivation of the spectral sequence for a (smooth) fiber bundle for deRham cohomology done entirely in the realm of the smooth category. Unfortunately, as it's written there it is not clear how to generalize to other cohomology theories (they write down a double complex, and they use very much the fact that cohomology is given as the cohomology of this chain complex.) Now, in Quillen's paper computing the complex cobordism ring, he introduces a geometric description of complex cobordism as a cohomology theory on smooth manifolds. I've been attempting, to no avail, to come up with a derivation of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for a smooth fibration without using CW complex-esque techniques. My question is: 

When geometrically flavoured words like "mapping cone" or "chain homotopy" crop up in homological algebra, there's usually a good reason. (In this case, looking at the chain complexes associated with each geometric construction gives the algebraic construction). But, for the life of me, I cannot find a reason why the "stable module category" deserves to be called "stable." It doesn't seem, superficially at least, to be related to the stable homotopy category. So: 

This is a nice question, so I'm not sure why it was never answered- maybe my answer is wrong and this question is harder than I thought? In any event here's my attempt: Under fairly mild hypotheses on your spectral sequences (i.e. that it converges in the sense of Weibel 5.2.11), we have a comparison theorem which says that if a map of convergent spectral sequences is an isomorphism for any $r$, then it induces an isomorphism on the abuttments. In particular, in this case I think that you definitely have a map of spectral sequences $\text{colim } E(X_i) \rightarrow E(\text{colim } X_i)$, and since it's an isomorphism at the $E_2$ page then it's an isomorphism from then on, so the theorem applies (at least in the case when the double complexes in question are, say, right half-plane or something). The comparison theorem is in Weibel, 5.2.12. 

Not sure if this counts, but a much older application of $Sq^1$ (appearing as a Bockstein) and some of its cousins appears in Serre's paper on Witt vector cohomology. He constructed a family of operations, in characteristic $p$, $\beta_r: H^1(\mathcal{O}_X) \rightarrow H^2(\mathcal{O}_X)$ called the higher Bocksteins and it's reasonable to think of the first of these as a $Sq^1$. A concrete application was given by Mumford who showed that a surface over a field of positive characteristic has smooth Picard scheme if and only if all of the Bocksteins on $H^1(\mathcal{O}_X)$ vanish. He later used this fact (amidst many others) in his and Bombieri's classification of algebraic surfaces in positive characteristic. 

Thanks to Freudenthal we know that $\pi_{n+k}(S^n)$ is independent of $n$ as soon as $n \ge k+2$. However, I was looking at the table on Wikipedia of some of the homotopy groups of spheres and noticed that $\pi_2^S$ (the second stable stem) and $\pi_6^S$ are achieved earlier than required by the suspension theorem. So my question is: What is known about this phenomenon of early stabilization in the homotopy groups of spheres? Does it occur finitely many times or infinitely many times? Also, is there any sort of intuitive reason why stabilization might occur early? Also, I spotted a few times where stabilization almost appeared, but there was a pesky copy of $\mathbb{Z}$ that appeared and then disappeared right before the stable range. I'm talking about the cases of $\pi_{11+n}(S^n)$, $\pi_{15+n}(S^n)$, and $\pi_{19+n}(S^n)$. I assume this has something to do with Hopf elements showing up somewhere? I know pretty much nothing about this except the basic homotopy theory, a few very small calculations, and the Pontrjagin construction relating all of this to framed manifolds- so any references or illuminating insights would be helpful! 

I always liked the following reason: Let's call a topology on a space "admissible" if the evaluation function $e: Hom(X,Y) \times X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous. Then the compact-open topology is coarser than any other admissible topology. In particular, in any case where the compact-open topology is admissible, it is the smallest possible topology that does this. EDIT: See comments for some references. I don't claim any originality here :) 

Example The Picard group of the category of motivic spectra over any base contains at least a copy of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ spanned by the simplicial sphere and $\mathbb{G}_m$. The exotic grading allows one to state and prove some pretty powerful statements, and is sort of related to the Grothendieck-Deligne yoga of weights. Example The Picard group of the category of (genuine) equivariant spectra contains the one-point compactifications of orthogonal representations (i.e. 'representation spheres') and you need this is extra bit of juice to get things like Poincaré duality in the equivariant setting. The most mysterious example, however, is the $K(n)$-local category (this is the thing that sees the $n$th layer of the rainbow of the sphere, we met $n=1$ earlier). We are still in the very early stages of understanding the Picard group of this category, but it's very desirable to do so. For one, there are mysterious duality phenomena in the $K(n)$-local category, analogous to the Poincaré duality example mentioned in the equivariant setting, which require exotic suspensions (see here). On the other hand, it can be useful to index the homotopy groups of something as a function of a $p$-adic number, say. Who knows- maybe the only way we'll ever get an answer to 'what are the ranks of the homotopy groups of spheres?' is to look for solutions like 'the special values of some horribly incomputable arithmetic-p-adic-y-L-type function'. But that's speculation. For some recent calculations, see some of the papers here by Paul Goerss and his collaborators (Henn, Mahowald, Rezk). 

It is a result of Mostov that any compact homogeneous manifold must have nonnegative Euler characteristic: $URL$ That should provide plenty of counterexamples. :) 

Let $V$ be an affine variety with a $\mathbb{G}_m$-action. Then you should think of $A_0$ as a good model for $V/\mathbb{G}_m$. So being connected says something like $\mathbb{G}_m$ acts transitively- at least from the point of view of functions. Being positively graded is saying something like the action of $\mathbb{G}_m$ extending to an action of the monoid scheme $\mathbb{A}^1$ (under multiplication). The last condition is more involved: The module $A_1$ is the set of $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant functions to $\mathbb{A}^1$ where we use the scaling action on $\mathbb{A}^1$. (So it's kind of like "linear" functions on $V$). This is a vector space over $k$, call its dual $W$ and view it as a variety. There's a natural equivariant map $V \to W$ given by evaluation (that's why we took the dual of the vector space of functions). We're asking that this equivariant map be an embedding. So, while $V$ is not a vector space with the standard linear action of $\mathbb{G}_m$, it can be embedded in one in some natural way. 

If $v \in K(S^2)$ denotes the Bott periodicity element, then $\psi^m(v) = mv$ $\psi^m$ induces a graded ring endomorphism of $K^*(pt)$ 

We've all done it: we have a "proof" that is so pretty... but we know it's wrong. Either it proves something we know is false, or the proof doesn't use one of the hypotheses you know it needs to, or we assume something we can't assume... and the whole pretty argument goes away. I had a professor who said that he sometimes convinces himself that some proof works right before he goes to bed, only to wake up and find out that it's total nonsense. He says it's probably some coping mechanism his body has so he can get some sleep! Though the proofs often end up unsalvageable (is that a word?), I think they are an important part of learning mathematics and being creative. I think it was Sir Ken Robinson (not a mathematician, but a good thinker) who said something like "Being wrong isn't always good, but if we don't have the capacity to be wrong we can never be creative." (If anyone knows the precise quote, do fill it in!) So let's hear them- your pretty proofs that turn out to be nonsense. Like the well-written "How not to prove the Poincare Conjecture," these can be well thought out proofs that have a small hidden assumption that makes everything blow-up, or they can be totally silly like the time I thought I proved Brouwer's fixed point theorem using the Baire Category Theorem during my freshman year... Bonus points if anyone's "false" methods (or a close adaptation) ended up working for a different problem later on! 

There are many variations on this theme... you could do things in a different order, or you could embed into a larger diagram which is often convenient, etc. etc. Of course, there's also the standard formula for a limit as an equalizer of two products, but I imagine you knew that already. Also- everything I said works for homotopy limits over ordinary categories. If you want to do homotopy limits over an $\infty$-category, you can still do something like this. In fact, said in the language of $\infty$-categories or quasicategories, this whole procedure is maybe more evident: take your quasicategory, which is a simplicial set $K$, and write it as an iterated pushout along cell inclusions (maybe transfinitely many). Then a homotopy colimit over $K$ can be computed by iteratively by using pushouts, or if you come across an empty diagram you'll need an initial object, and then taking filtered colimits along the way. One can take care of limits by working in the opposite category. 

So I just started learning about quasicategories... Alright, that's an understatement: I just listened to Julie Bergner talk about quasicategories, and then started reading Moritz Groth's short course about them. I did a quick google search for this question, but there's a high probability that I just wasn't using the right terminology, or that I'm being silly. In any case, here is my question: Suppose you have yourself a quasicategory (or $\infty$-category, or weak kan complex, whatever you call it). Is it always possible to embed this into a finitely bicomplete, pointed quasicategory? (I purposefully didn't ask for a way to make it a stable $\infty$-category, though that may be equally possible). An existence statement would be nice, a construction or reference to an instruction would be even nicer. A bit more down to earth: Can this even be done with small categories? If you have a small category, can you always add objects to it in some way to make it finitely bicomplete? I suppose if I wanna sound fancy then I might want to be asking for an adjoint to the inclusion functor from complete categories into categories... or something like that. There's a good reason I'd like to know all of this... but it's Level 1 Classified by the NSA. (In other words... I'd like to think about it a bit more to make sure I don't embarrass myself playing with machinery I don't understand yet.) NB: Easy on the higher categorical language... I'm good with categories, and I'm good with simplicial sets. If you need to use something bigger, then please give a reference, or a gentle description. Thanks!
