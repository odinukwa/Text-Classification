The answer to the first half of your question is no, though, at least consistently. Let $\mathbb{N}^*=\beta \mathbb{N} \setminus \mathbb{N}$ be the remainder of the Stone-Cech compactification of the integers. Under the Continuum Hypothesis, the set of all $P$-points is a dense subset of $\mathbb{N}^*$. But $\mathbb{N}^*$ has no dense meager subset. Indeed, let $\{N_n: n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ be a sequence of nowhere dense sets. Construct a decreasing sequence of open sets $\{U_n: n \in \mathbb{N} \}$ such that $U_n \cap D_n =\emptyset$ and $\overline{U_{n+1}} \subset U_n$ for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$. The set $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \overline{U_n}=\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n$ is non-empty because of compactness. Moreover, every countable intersection of open subsets of $\mathbb{N}^*$ has non-empty interior (see, for example, Jan van Mill's chapter on $\beta \mathbb{N}$ in the Handbook of Set-theoretic Topology). Thus $Int(\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} U_n)$ is a non-empty open set missing every $N_n$ and hence $\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}} N_n$ is not dense. 

An L-space is a regular hereditarily Lindelof space which is not hereditarily separable. Consistent examples of L-spaces are relatively easy to come by (for example, Suslin Lines), but the first construction of an L-space in ZFC was only given in 2006 by J.T. Moore. Moore's space has lots of convergent sequences. Actually, it's even Frechet-Urysohn, meaning that every point in the closure of a set can be approximated by a countable convergent sequence lying inside that set (see Theorem 7.8 from Justin Tatch Moore, MR 2220104 A solution to the $L$ space problem, J. Amer. Math. Soc. 19 (2006), no. 3, 717--736 (electronic).). However, there are consistent examples of L-spaces which lack any non-trivial convergent sequences and in a pretty extreme way. Take a Sierpinski subset of the real line (that is, an uncountable subset of $\mathbb{R}$ having countable intersection with every Lebesgue null set) and provide it with the topology inherited from the density topology (that is the topology on $\mathbb{R}$ whose open sets are the measurable sets with Lebesgue density 1 at each one of their points). Then the resulting space is regular and hereditarily Lindelof and has the property that every countable subset is closed discrete (This was first observed in H. E. White, Jr., MR 341379 Topological spaces in which Blumberg’s theorem holds, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 44 (1974), 454--462. and Franklin D. Tall, MR 419709 The density topology, Pacific J. Math. 62 (1976), no. 1, 275--284.). The existence of Sierpinski set is consistent with and independent from ZFC (CH easily provides a Sierpinski set via induction on $\omega_1$ but $MA_{\omega_1}$ kills all Sierpinski sets), so it's natural to ask: 

Consider a uniform vector matroid $M(0)=U_{m,n}$ of rank $m$ with $n$ points, $n>m>2$ (you can think of it as a set of $n$ points in general position in vector space $F^m$ for some large field $F$). We perform a series of $T$ consecutive independent random transformations of $M(0)$ to obtain matroid $M(T)$. At $t$-th transformation we choose a random set of $3$ points $x,y,z$ uniformly out of $n$ points of the $M(t-1)$-th ground set. We delete $z$ from $M(t-1)$ (obtaining $M(t-1)\backslash \{z\}$) and add a new point $z'$ freely to the closure of $\{x,y\}$. Equivalently, the new $z$ becomes a linear combination of $x,y$ in general position. The new matroid $M(t)=M(t-1)\backslash \{z\}+_{\textrm{cl}\{x,y\}} z'$ still has $n$ points, but, possibly, lower rank. How to analyze the evolution of $\textrm{rank }M(t)$ with $t$? Specifically, I am interested in estimating the average $t$ for which the rank becomes $m-1$. Any references to related topics would also be greatly appreciated. 

This question originates from an engineering problem, which I am solving. Any related references are highly appreciated. Let $M_k(T)=\prod_{t=1}^T P_t S_k$ over some field (finite or reals), where $P_t$ is a random (uniform, i.i.d. over $t$) $n\times n$ permutation matrix, and $S_k$ is a fixed idempotent matrix of rank $n-1$ of the following form $$ S_1=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \cdots \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \cdots \\ 0 & 0 & \\ \vdots & \vdots & \huge{I_{n-2}} \\ 0 & 0 & \end{pmatrix}, S_2=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 &0 & 0 \cdots \\ 0 & 1 &0& 0 \cdots \\ 1 & 1 &0& 0 \cdots \\ 0 & 0 &0& \\ \vdots &\vdots & \vdots & \huge{I_{n-3}} \\ 0 & 0 &0& \end{pmatrix}, \\ S_k=\begin{pmatrix} & &&0 & \\ & \huge{I_k} &&\vdots& \huge{0} \\ & &&0& \\ 1 & \cdots &1&0& 0 \cdots \\ & & &0& \\ & \huge{0}& & \vdots & \huge{I_{n-k-1}} \\ &&&0& \end{pmatrix}.$$ Essentially, each additional multiplication by $P_t S_k$ replaces some row of $M_k(t-1)$ with a linear combination of $k$ other rows. It is not hard to see that $\mbox{rank } M_k(t)$ is non-increasing in $t$, and $\lim_{T\to \infty} \mbox{rank } M_k(T) \leq k$ almost surely. I am looking into the rate of this convergence. 

You can find the asymptotics for this probability. For that let $$ \tau:=\inf\{i\ge 1: S_i\le i^\alpha\}. $$ Then, if $Var(S_1)<\infty$ then the asymptotics for $$ p_n=\mathbf P(\tau>n)\sim \frac{C}{\sqrt n},\quad n\to \infty, $$ see $URL$ for random walks with i.i.d. increments, and $URL$ for random walks whose increments are independent but not necessarily identical. In the latter case the answer is $$ \mathbf P(\tau >n) \sim \frac{C}{\sqrt{Var(S_n)} },\quad n\to \infty. $$ I have doubts about existence of a simple (and accurate) lower bound. 

For fixed $t<1/\lambda$ it seems that intuition B is correct as $N \to \infty $. In this case, using the large deviations, one can see that it is highly unlikely that more than $(N+\varepsilon)\lambda t$ customers have arrived in time interval [0,t]. As there are $N$ servers and customers join the shortest queue it means that there will be empty servers and new customers will simply join them. Therefore, for $t<1/\lambda$ there will be a proportion of $\lambda t$ servers with 1 customer and $(1-\lambda t)$ servers with 0 customers. It might be good to have a look at N. D. Vvedenskaya, R. L. Dobrushin, F. I. Karpelevich, “Queueing System with Selection of the Shortest of Two Queues: An Asymptotic Approach”, Probl. Peredachi Inf., 32:1 (1996), 20–34, who studied a related system. 

They simply take the exact formula for the ruin probability of a simple random walk and use it as an approximation. Ruin probability of a simple random walk that jumps to $+1$ with probability $p$ and to $-1$ with probability q is given by $(q/p)^z$ if $p>q$. Then, take the random walk that starts at $u=Cz$ and jumps to $+C$ or $-C$ with the same probabilities. Pick $C$, $p$ and $q$ in such a way that the mean and variance of simple random walk are equal to that of the Gaussian random walk. This gives the following equations $$ C(p-q)=\mu $$ and $$ C^2(p+q)= \mu^2+\sigma^2. $$ Of course, $p+q=1$. Then the probability of ruin of this random walk will be $(p/q)^{u/C}$ and after finding $p$ and $q$ will be exactly the formula that you gave. Of course, this is not really a proof, just an explanation how one can obtain this approximation. I doubt that a rigorous proof exists. However, as $u\to \infty$, one can use Cramer asymptotics for probability of ruin. 

A wonderful mistake, which paved the way to singular cardinals, was done by Felix Bernstein in his dissertation. I learnt this from Menachem Kojman. Berstein thought he had proved that for every ordinal $\alpha$, $\aleph_\alpha^\omega=\aleph_\alpha \cdot 2^{\aleph_0}$. This is true for every $\alpha < \omega$ but already fails for $\alpha=\omega$. Berstein's mistake was to assume that every cardinal has an immediate predecessor. Kőnig later used Berstein's result to prove that the continuum is not an aleph, thus disproving at once two of Cantor's main beliefs: 1) every set can be well-ordered and 2) the continuum hypothesis! He presented his result at the third International Congress of Mathematicians in Heidelberg in 1904 and the organizers cancelled all parallel session to allow all participants (which included Cantor and Hilbert) to attend Kőnig's lecture. And his discovery was even reported in the local news! Here is Kőnig's reasoning: First he proves the correct result that for every ordinal $\beta$, $\aleph_{\beta+\omega}^\omega>\aleph_{\beta+\omega}$ (a special case of what is now known as Kőnig's Theorem). He then reasons that if the continuum were an aleph, say $2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_\beta$, then substituting $\alpha=\beta+\omega$ into Berstein's result one obtains that $\aleph_{\beta+\omega}^\omega=\aleph_{\beta+\omega} \cdot 2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_{\beta+\omega}$, which is a contradiction! 

Let $\Delta(\kappa, \mu)$ be the statement: "let $F$ be a family of cardinality $\kappa$ of sets of cardinality less than $\mu$. Then there is a family $G \subset F$ of cardinality $\kappa$ and a set $r$ such that $a \cap b=r$ for every $a,b \in G$". We know that if $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal and $\lambda^{<\mu} < \kappa$, for every $\lambda < \kappa$ then $\Delta(\kappa, \mu)$ holds. My question is: 

One approach to this is to track the number $N_0(M(t))$ of zero-columns or the number $N(M(t))$ of rows $r$, s.t. $r$ contains the first row of $M(1)$ in its linear decomposition. These numbers follow the Markov property, and one can construct corresponding linear Markov chains with $n+1$ states to find their long-term behavior and bound $$\mbox{rank } M(T) \leq n-N_0(M(T)) \\ E[\mbox{rank } M(T)] \leq n \Pr[N(M(T))>0] $$ Although the bounds are tight for $k=1$, they are very loose for $k>1, T\gg n$. In fact for $k=1$ the rank drops to $1$ rather quickly in $T = O(n^2)$, but for $k>1$, the decay seems to be exponentially slow, e.g. $E[\mbox{rank } M_3(10^5)]\approx E[\mbox{rank } M_3(10^7)] \approx 5$ for $n=20$ (numerically). Another numerical observation shows that for $n\ge 10$ the resulting $E[\mbox{rank } M(T)]$ does not depend much on the field size once it is prime and larger than $7$. Any reference to studying the long products like $M(t)$ of random permutations with a fixed matrix $S$ would be also appreciated. 

There are results pertaining to the finite field case. According to this paper, for a finite field $F_q$ and a set of $r$ points $x_1,\dotsc,x_r\in F_q^n$ deciding whether there exists a subset of $k$ dependent points among them is NP-complete and requires $poly(n)\min(\binom{r}{k}, q^{\Theta(n+k^2)})$ time (assuming 3-SAT requires exponential time). The algorithm for $q^{\Theta(n+k^2)}$ part is based on FFT. Moreover, the algorithm not only checks existence, but also counts the solutions (approximates — in the case of minimal dependent $k$-subsets, i.e. circuits). Also, one can find a specific solution by running the algorithm on sequentially increased inputs and paying overhead of $O(rk)$. 

Yes, take any model of $\neg CH$ where a Suslin Line exists (for example, start with a ground model where $CH$ does not hold and use Tennenbaum's original forcing for adding a Suslin Tree). We can assume that our Suslin Line is compact. Indeed, let $Y$ be its Dedekind completion. Then $Y$ is a compact ccc linearly ordered topological space. We claim that $Y$ is not separable. Note that every ccc linearly ordered space is hereditarily Lindelof, so in particular, $Y$ has points $G_\delta$. Since $Y$ is compact, this implies that $Y$ is first-countable. If $Y$ were separable then, we could fix a countable dense subset $D$ of $Y$ and exploit first-countability to take, for every $x \in D$, a sequence $S_x$ inside our original Suslin Line, which converges to $x$. But then we would get that $\bigcup \{S_x: x \in D \}$ is a countable dense subset of our original Suslin Line, which is a contradiction. So $Y$ is a compact (first-countable) Suslin Line Since $Y$ is a compact first-countable space, by a theorem of Shapirovskii (see Juhasz's Cardinal Functions book), we can find a cardinal $\kappa$ and an irreducible continuous mapping $f$: $$f: Y \to \Sigma(\mathbb{R}^\kappa):=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^\kappa: |x^{-1}(1)| \leq \aleph_0 \}$$ The image $f(Y)$ is clearly a ccc Corson compact, and since irreducible maps preserve density, $f(Y)$ is not separable. So $f(Y)$ is a ccc non-metrizable Corson compact. 

Then $S(\kappa)$ holds if and only if $\kappa$ is a regular cardinal. But things become more complicated if we just consider subsets of $\kappa$ of a fixed cardinality smaller than $\kappa$. For example, let $C(\kappa)$ be the statement: 

The answer to your question is given in Feller's book (Introduction to Probability Theory and its applications), Volume 2, Chapter 6, Section on persistent and transient random walks. In my edition, this is Chapter 6.X, Theorems 3 and 4. Theorem 4 says that a random walk with zero mean is persistent. Theorem 3 says that a persistent random walk visits every interval infinitely often in the non-arithmetic case and gives the corresponding statement for arithmetic random walk. 

This is just a bound from below. The derivation is a bit long for a comment. Clearly, a positive solution to the equation exists (although you need to specify in more details what happens when $X_1=0$ as $\lambda_1=0$ in this case). Now, we have \begin{align*} \sum_{j=2}^nX_{j} &= \sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{j=2}^n\left(\sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \lambda_i\right)\ln (\lambda_j/\lambda_{j-1})\\ &=\sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i\left(\sum_{j=i+1}^n \ln(\lambda_j/\lambda_{j-1})\right) \\ &=\sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i \ln(\lambda_n/\lambda_i) \end{align*} Now since $\lambda_i>0$ we can make use of the inequality $\ln(1+x)\le x$ to obtain \begin{align*} \sum_{j=2}^nX_{j}&\le \sum_{j=2}^n\lambda_j+\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\lambda_i (\lambda_n/\lambda_i-1)\\ &=\lambda_n-\lambda_1+(n-1)\lambda_n \end{align*} Dividing both sides by $n$ and letting $n \to \infty$ we obtain by the Law of Large Numbers, $$ \lambda \le \liminf_{n\to\infty}\lambda_n, \quad \mbox{a.s.} $$ 

Just an addition to Pablo Lessa's comment. If probability to stay at a point is zero, then you have a simple random walk and the Reflection Principle is valid. So, your question will follow if you find the joint distribution of the maximum and minimum, as the simple random walk visits all points between them. The exact formula for the joint distribution of the maximum and minimum can be found in e.g. book of Billingsley, Convergence of probability measures, Chapter 2.11. The question can also be reformulated as the distribution of the first exit time from an interval [-a,b]. Then, another reference (for the zero-mean random walk) is this paper $URL$ of Kemperman, Asymptotic expansions for the Smirnov test for the range of cumulative sums. Ann. Math. Statist. 30 1959 448–462. The more general case (when probability to stay at 0 is greater than 0) can be treated similarly to the above references.
