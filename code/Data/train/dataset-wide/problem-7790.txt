This is a general fact in differential cohomology, which in degree two classifies Hermitian line bundles with connection. Differential cohomology has an exact sequence $$ 0 \to \frac{H^{k-1}(M,\mathbb{R})}{H^{k-1}(M,\mathbb{Z})} \to \hat H^k(M,\mathbb{Z}) \to H^k(M,\mathbb{Z}) \times_{H^k(M,\mathbb{R})} \Omega^k_{cl}(M). $$ In your case, the pair $((L,\mu),\omega)$ is an element in the group on the right hand side, and the possible prequantizations are those elements in the middle mapping to that element. EDIT: The third arrow in above sequence sends a Hermitian line bundle with connection $(L,\mu,\Delta)$ to the pair $(c_1(L),R^{\Delta})$ consisting of the first Chern class of $L$ and the curvature of $\Delta$. Two choices of $\Delta$ lead to two different elements $(L,\mu,\Delta)$ and $(L,\mu,\Delta')$ in $\hat H^2(M,\mathbb{Z})$. By your assumption that $\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ have the same curvature, the difference between the two elements lies in the kernel of the third arrow, and hence in the image of the second. 

Parts 1 and 2 are a theorem of J. Barrett, proved in "Holonomy and Path Structures in General Relativity and Yand-Mills Theory". Part 3 is in my paper "Transgression to Loop Spaces and its Inverse I". Corollary. Two principal $A$-bundles with connection (no matter if flat or not) are isomorphic as bundles, if and only if their holonomy functionals are homotopic in the sense of 3. The non-abelian case should be similiar. In fact, Barrett's result is valid for non-abelian groups. 

Iterated integrals define a map $$ \sigma: C(\Omega(M)) \to \Omega(LM) $$ where $C(\Omega(M))$ is the cyclic bar complex of $\Omega(M)$. It has various nice properties; for instance, it induces an isomorphism in cohomology, when $M$ is simply-connected. Unfortunately, the forms in the image of $\sigma$ are not invariant with respect to the $S^1$-action on $LM$, which probably means that there is no relation of the kind you expect. However, the forms in the image of $\sigma$ are basic (in particular, invariant) with respect to the action of $Diff([0,1])$ by reparameterization, but the image of $\sigma$ is not even dense in the space of all basic forms. (The image is characterized by a stronger invariance that cannot be formulated in terms of a group action: a kind of thin homotopy invariance). Just in order to add a layer of confusion, I remark that if $G$ is a compact group acting on $M$, there exists a $G$-equivariant extension of the iterated integral map $\sigma$, introduced by Getzler-Jones-Petrack. It uses the Cartan model for $G$-equivariant forms on $LM$, and an equivariant version of the cyclic bar complex of equivariant forms on $M$. 

Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a principal 2-bundle with structure 2-group a crossed module $t:H \to G$. Then, the holonomy of a connection on $\mathcal{P}$ around a surface $\Sigma$ is a well-defined element $$\mathrm{Hol}_{\mathcal{P}}(\Sigma) \in H/[G,H],$$ where $[G,H]$ is the normal subgroup of $H$ generated by all elements of the form $h^{-1}\alpha(g,h)$, where $\alpha$ denotes the action of $G$ on $H$ of the crossed module. Above quotient generalizes the concept of "conjugacy class". This is explained in detail in my paper with Urs Schreiber 

In differential geometry one often also has connections on the bundles, e.g. the Levi-Cevita connection on the tangent bundle. Many concepts of differential geometry use connections, such as holonomy or geodesics. I'd love to learn the opposite to the following statement, but I have the feeling that there is no "nice" definition of a connection in the sheaf-theoretical approach. So I think this is another aspect why bundles are often preferred. As a little side remark, I'd like to point out that in higher differential geometry the story continues. Curiously, the word "gerbe" - which comes originally from the sheaf-theoretical side - is often at the same time used for the higher analog of a bundle. This is one of the reasons why different people associate so diverse meanings with "gerbe". 

Let $G$ be a Lie group, and let $\underline{G}$ denote the sheaf of smooth $G$-valued maps, i.e. for a smooth manifold $M$ we have $G(M) = C^\infty(M,G)$. What are conditions on $G$ that imply that $\underline{G}$ is acyclic, i.e. the sheaf cohomology $H^n(M,\underline{G})=0$ for all smooth manifolds $M$ and all $n>0$? It is clear that soft, flabby or fine sheaves are acyclic. I am interested in concrete conditions on the group $G$, e.g. like smooth contractibility. EDIT: Daniel's answer below answers my question in the case that $G$ is abelian, using the classification of abelian Lie groups. So let us concentrate on the case that $G$ is non-abelian. The condition I am looking for is supposed to imply the vanishing of the set $H^1(M,\underline{G})$. This set can be defined for example via Cech cohomology. Its geometrical meaning is that it classifies principal $G$-bundles over $M$ up to isomorphism. 

I second Andr√©'s comment that one cannot expect interesting, smooth 2-cocycles $\omega: LG \times LG \to S^1$. The situation for Lie groups is simply different to the one for Lie algebras: central Lie algebra extensions $$ 0 \to \mathfrak{a} \to \widehat{\mathfrak{g}} \to \mathfrak{g} \to 0 $$ can be classified by cocycles $\kappa: \mathfrak{g} \times \mathfrak{g} \to \mathfrak{a}$ forming the Lie algebra cohomology $H^2(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{a})$. Lie group extensions $$ 1 \to A \to \widehat{G} \to G \to 1 $$ that are classified by smooth cocycles $\omega:G \times G \to A$ are precisely those that are trivializable as principal $A$-bundles over $G$. General central Lie group extensions are classified by Segal-Mitchison-Brylinski group cohomology $H^2_{SMB}(G,A)$. The 2-cocycles there involve open covers $\mathcal{U}^k$ of $G^k=G \times ...\times G$, compatible with the face maps of the simplicial manifold $G^*$, and smooth maps $$ g_{\alpha\beta}: U_{\alpha}^1 \cap U_{\beta}^1 \to A \quad\text{and}\quad h_{\alpha}: U_\alpha^2 \to A $$ satisfying various conditions. ($g_{\alpha\beta}$ are the transition functions for $\widehat{G}$ as an $A$-bundle, and $h_{\alpha}$ remembers the multiplication of the Lie group $\widehat G$). All this is true for Lie groups $G$ just like for loop groups like $LG$. Thus, a smooth 2-cocycle $\omega: LG \times LG \to S^1$ classifies a central extension of $LG$ by the circle that is trivial as a circle bundle over $LG$. For compact, simple, simply-connected Lie groups $G$ it is well-known that such extensions are totally trivial, i.e. $\omega$ must be the coboundary of a smooth map $LG \to S^1$. 

The paper Extensions of symmetric cat-groups by D. Bourn and E.M. Vitale defines and studies a bicategory of extensions of 2-groups (called cat-groups in the paper). In section 13, it introduces a monoidal structure that categorifies the Baer sum of extensions. Just like Chris's answer, this is one categorical level higher then you wanted, but maybe you can decategorify it once :-) 

A nice point of view is to consider principal bundles with structure group $B\mathbb{C}^\times$. One can probably take any abelian Lie group instead of $\mathbb{C}^\times$. Principal $B\mathbb{C}^\times$-bundles are one way to give a precise meaning to what you are calling "patching together classifying spaces". The point is that there is an isomorphism $$ H^1(X,B\mathbb{C}^\times) = H^2(X,\mathbb{C}^\times), $$ which explains the relation to the second cohomology group. It is basically saying that principal $B\mathbb{C}^\times$-bundles are the same as $\mathbb{C}^\times$-gerbes. This isomorphism is induced from the exact sequence $$ 1 \to \mathbb{C}^\times \to E\mathbb{C}^\times \to B\mathbb{C}^\times \to 1 $$ of groups, and the fact that the sheaf of $E\mathbb{C}^\times$-valued functions on a paracompact space $X$ is soft. All this is very nicely explained in Gajer's Inventiones paper "Geometry of Deligne cohomology". 

Of course some concepts that appear here would need some more explanation - but that's not the point. Let me better point out how gerbes with connection come into the picture. We employ two results from gerbe theory: 

B-Fields in string theory form a 2-category. This has physical relevance, for example when string theories are glued together along defect lines on the worldsheet. Along a defect line, the two B-fields are related by a 1-morphism. On a junction between defect lines, there is a 2-isomorphism relating the 1-morphisms of the various defect lines ending at that junction. The paper Affine su(2) fusion rules from gerbe 2-isomorphisms by the physicists Ingo Runkel and Rafal Suszek explains very nicely the phyical relevance of these 2-isomorphisms, certainly far outside the realm of higher category theory. 

There is a bicategory of Dixmier-Douady bundles of algebras which is equivalent to the bicategory of bundle gerbes. In particular, sections into these bundles form algebras. The price you pay is that the bundles are infinite-dimensional; for that reson I am not sure if that picture persists in a setting "with connections". I do not know a good source for the bicategory of Dixmier-Douady bundles or for the equivalence. Everything depends certainly on the type of morphisms you consider between the bundles; they clearly have to be of some Morita flavor. You may look into Meinrenken's "Twisted K-homology and group-valued moment maps", Section 2.1.1 and 2.1.4. In Section 2.4 Meinrenken indicates indirectly that his bicategory of Dixmier-Douady bundles is equivalent to the one of bundle gerbes, by transfering the notion of a multiplicative bundle gerbe (which depends on the definitions of 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms) into his language. Side remark: a bundle gerbe is not the direct generalization of transition functions of a bundle. There is one step in between, namely a bundle 0-gerbe: instead of open sets, it allows for a general surjective submersion as the support for its transition functions. If you take bundle 0-gerbes instead of transition functions, the functor you mentioned at the beginning of your question has as canonical inverse functor. See my paper with Thomas Nikolaus "Four equivalent versions of non-abelian gerbes". Added (after thinking a bit more about the question): If you want to categorify the vector space of sections into a vector bundle, you first have to fix a categorification of a vector space. An algebra is one possible version of a "2-vector space", probably due to Lurie. Another version, due to Kapranov-Voevodsky, is to define a 2-vector space as a module category over the monoidal category of vector spaces (add some adjectives if you like). Let us define a section of a bundle gerbe $\mathcal{G}$ over $M$ to be a 1-morphism $s: \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{G}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the trivial bundle gerbe. Then, sections form a category, namely the Hom-category $Hom(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{G})$ of the bicategory of bundle gerbes (the one with the "more morphisms" defined in my paper which was mentioned in the question). The category $Hom(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{G})$ of sections of $\mathcal{G}$ has naturally the structure of a module category over the monoidal category of vector bundles over $M$. Indeed, a vector bundle is the same as a 1-morphism between trivial gerbes, i.e. an object in $Hom(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{I})$. Under this identification, the module structure is given by composition: $$ Hom(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{G}) \times Hom(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{I}) \to Hom(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{G}). $$ The functor which regards a vector space as a trivial vector bundle induces the claimed module structure over vector spaces.
