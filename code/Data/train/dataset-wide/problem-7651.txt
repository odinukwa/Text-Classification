(Here $\mbox{ex}(n ; H)$ is the maximum number of edges for an $n$-vertex graph with no subgraphs isomorphic to $H$.) 

The following random construction is simple enough that I am guessing it must have been studied. Fix $d \ge 3$, and let $n > d$. For each of the $n$ vertices, pick exactly $d$ other vertices to connect it to, uniformly over all ${n-1 \choose d}$ possible choices, and making this choice independently over all $n$ vertices. Some edges may get put in twice, and that's fine, but we will consider the final graph to not have multiple edges. 

I know that Morris and Soltan's survey article covers some higher-dimensional cases, but I don't remember if they have any bounds of the kind you're asking for. $URL$ 

You might look at Robert MacPherson and Benjamin Schweinhart's recent preprint "Measuring Shape with Topology", where they use topological methods (i.e. persistent homology) to estimate fractal dimension for branched polymers, Brownian trees, and self-avoiding random walks. Link: $URL$ 

Andrew Newman just posted a preprint to the arXiv, showing that for every prime $p$ and $d \ge 2$, you can get $p$-torsion in homology $H_{d-1}(K)$ with only $O(\log^{1/d} p)$ vertices. (The implied constant depends on $d$, but not on $p$.) This is best possible, up to a constant factor. His construction starts with something similar to what Speyer describes above, which gets you a complex with $O( \log p)$ vertices. Then he applies the probabilistic method, taking a certain carefully chosen random quotient of the complex, gluing together vertices in a random way. This doesn't affect torsion in homology. The problem is that it might not result in a simplicial complex. But Newman uses the Lovász local lemma to show that with positive probability, it does. Hence there exists a vertex identification that works. 

Kahn and Kalai's, "A counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture" is a 3-page paper which settles a sixty-year-old conjecture with an explicit counterexample in $\mathbb{R}^{1325}$ (and in all sufficiently high dimensions). Although the paper is 3 pages, most of that is background on the problem and references --- the construction itself is only one paragraph. They include an apt literary quote. 

Gil Kalai has a beautiful paper from 1983 where he shows that, on average, $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic $d$-dimensional simplicial complexes $S$ with complete $(d-1)$-skeleton on $n$ vertices have $$| H_{d-1}(S, \mathbb{Z}) | \ge \exp (c n^d) $$ for some constant $c > 0$ depending only on $d$ and not on $n$. These results are for the total size of the torsion group, and not for $p$-torsion specifically. But for $d=2$ this at least gives that torsion group can grow exponentially in $n^2$, rather than in $n$. Now the more speculative part. My best guess for the structure of $H_{d-1}(S, \mathbb{Z})$, for a suitable measure on random $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic complexes $S$, would be Cohen-Lenstra heuristics --- the idea that the probability that a random finite abelian group is isomorphic to $G$ is proportional to the size of the automorphism group of $G$. If something like this holds, then with probability bounded away from zero, $H_{d-1}(S, \mathbb{Z}) $ is cyclic. If anything like this is the case, we should expect that there exist $2$-dimensional simplicial complexes on $n$ vertices with $p$-torsion, where $p$ is of order $\exp (cn^2)$. Linial, Meshulam, and Rosenthal recently provided new examples of $\mathbb{Q}$-acyclic complexes, by defining complexes symmetrically on vertex set $\mathbb{Z} / p$ and then analyzing the Fourier transform of homology. I did a little experimenting with their examples in SAGE and found a $2$-dimensional simplicial complex $S$ on $31$ vertices with $$| H_1(S, \mathbb{Z}) | = 736712186612810774591.$$ This is a product of distinct primes, so it is necessarily a cyclic group. (The largest prime factor is $408437$.) 

A notorious problem in combinatorics is the following: If we color $\mathbb{R}^2$ so that no pair of points at unit distance get the same color, what is the fewest number of colors required? This number is sometimes called "the chromatic number of the plane" $\chi$ (since it is really a graph coloring problem on an infinite graph), and it is easily see that $ 4 \le \chi \le 7$ but these bounds have stood for quite a while. It is natural to ask about coloring other metric spaces, and many people have. In particular, there are bounds known for the chromatic number of $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \ge 3$ (and some asymptotics as $d \to \infty$). Also there has been some work on coloring the two-dimensional sphere of radius $r$. (A nice reference for this kind of problem is Soifer's "The mathematical coloring book.") My question is whether anyone has looked at the chromatic number of the hyperbolic plane. As with the sphere, there is a free parameter --- one could either take fixed curvature $-1$ and let the distance vary, or fix unit distance and let the constant negative curvature vary. We might not expect to be able to solve this in general, since determining the chromatic number of the plane seems difficult, and now we have an infinite family of such problems. But we should be able to put bounds, and I am wondering what is known. In particular, the following two questions come to mind. I would appreciate insights or pointers to references if these things have been previously studied. 

I am also interested in how sharp this upper threshold is, and in particular whether the threshold is sharp in the sense of Friedgut and Kalai. Finally, we could call this property $\mathcal{P}_2$ since it is about intersecting pairs of neighborhoods, and say that a graph has property $\mathcal{P}_k$ if for every $v$ there exist $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k$ such that $$\bigcap_i N(x_i) = v,$$ and I'm also interested in this more general setting. 

The girth of a graph is the length of its smallest cycle. Studying the maximum possible girth for a $k$-regular graph on $n$ vertices is a very well-studied problem. In the 1988 paper "Ramanujan graphs", Lubotzky, Philips, and Sarnak showed that there exist $k$-regular graphs with girth $(4/3) \log_{k-1} n$. The graphs they construct are Cayley graphs on $PSL(2, \mathbb{Z}/q)$ and the proof that the girth is as large as claimed depends on subtle number-theoretic considerations. On the other hand, a simple counting argument shows that the girth can never be more than $2 \log_{k-1} n$. I am wondering what the best known bounds are, 25 years after this landmark paper, especially for the case of cubic graphs $k=3$. In particular, have either of the constants $4/3$ or $2$ been improved? (Although there has also been study of this kind of question for small $n$, I am only interested in the asymptotics as $n \to \infty$.) 

Added: I do not need an exact answer, but only asymptotic upper bounds. For example if $k \approx N$ is it true that the number of critical values of $F$ is bounded by $e^{cN}$ for some constant $c$? 

A standard measure on trees on $n$ vertices is the Uniform Spanning Tree (UST) on the complete graph. This is the measure where every tree has equal probability, $1 / n^{n-2}$ by Cayley's formula. Here is another measure. Take an Erdős–Rényi (i.e. edge independent) random graph $G \in G(n,p)$ with $p$ large enough to ensure that $G$ is asymptotically almost surely connected, and then choose a UST on $G$. Note that if $p = 1$ these two measures are identical. My guess is that they are close (say in total variation distance), even for much smaller $p$. In particular, suppose that $$p \ge \frac{\log n + \omega}{n},$$ where $\omega \to \infty$ arbitrarily slowly as $n \to \infty$. (This is barely sufficient to guarantee that the probability that $G$ is connected tends to one.) 

The $k$-core of a finite graph is defined as follows. Delete all vertices of degree $< k$ and repeat until there are no such vertices left. If there is a nonempty subgraph remaining, necessarily of minimum degree $\ge k$, we call this graph the $k$-core. If the deletion process results in removing all vertices, we say that the graph has no $k$-core. Let $f(n,k)$ denote the maximum number of edges in a simple graph on $n$ vertices with no $k$-core. For example, if $f(n,2)=n-1$ for every $n$, since $n$ edges are sufficient (and necessary) to guarantee the existence of a cycle. What about $k \ge 3$? Maybe a formula is too much to hope for, so for fixed $k$ what are the asymptotics of $f(n,k)$ as $n \to \infty$? I suspect this kind of question has been studied, so any references would be appreciated. It is very similar in flavor to questions in "classical" extremal graph theory, where one tries to maximize the number of edges in a graph on $n$ vertices with no $H$-subgraph, where $H$ is a fixed graph. This question fits in a more general setting where $H$ ranges over an infinite family of possible subgraphs. 

Is it true that if a finite CW complex $X$ is simply connected, and $\tilde{H}_i(X, \mathbb{Q}) =0$ for $i \neq D$, then $X$ is rationally homotopy equivalent to a bouquet of $D$-dimensional spheres? (In my setting $D \ge 3$, in case that makes any difference.) 

Suppose I have a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, edge set $E \subseteq {V \choose 2}$, and a weight function $w:E \to \mathbb{R}^{+}$. Is there a nice algorithmic way to decide if there is an assignment of vertices to points in Euclidean space, i.e. a function $f: V(G) \to \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $|f(x)-f(y)| = w( \{x,y \})$ whenever $\{ x, , y\} \in E$, where $|.|$ is the Euclidean norm? There is no harm in insisting that the weight function $d$ respect the triangle inequality. The question I am most interested in is efficiently deciding whether there exists such a function $f$, for a given graph $G$ and weight function $d$, but it might also be interesting to know how to try to find a map that does the job but with "small distortion". For example, quadratic optimization tells us something... Cases of special interest: (1) We have a complete graph $G=K_n$, i.e. a finite metric space. (2) The weight function $f$ is constant, i.e. we want to know: is $G$ a unit distance graph in $\mathbb{R}^d$? (Sometimes people want "unit distance graph" to also mean that $f$ is injective, but for my purposes it is fine for vertices to lie on top of each other.) Even the case of $f$ constant and $d=2$ is interesting, as this could be useful for a computational attack on the Hadwiger-Nelson unit coloring problem. I've noticed that this question is equivalent to asking if a certain real algebraic variety of degree $2$ is nonempty, but I'm not sure if that is a helpful observation, other than it guarantees, for example, that is it algorithmically decidable. 

Let $\{ G_n \}_{n \ge 1}$ be a sequence of graphs such that the number of vertices of $G_n$ tends to $\infty$ as $n \to \infty$. We say that $\{ G_n \}_{n \ge 1}$ is an expander family if $\lambda_2( G_n)$ is bounded away from $0$ as $n \to \infty$. Here $\lambda_2(H)$ is the smallest positive eigenvalue of the normalized graph Laplacian of $H$. If every $G_n$ is the $1$-skeleton of a simple $3$-polytope, you can not have an expander family. This follows from the planar separator theorem. What if every $G_n$ is the $1$-skeleton of a simple $4$-polytope? If you relax "simple" then there are obvious examples — in particular, cyclic polytopes in dimension $4$ have complete graphs for their $1$-skeletons, so they are expanders. If it is hard to come up with an example for simple $4$-polytope, does it make it easier if we allow the dual graph of an arbitrary simplicial $3$-sphere? 

The Erdős–Gallai theorem gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite sequence of natural numbers to be the degree sequence of a simple graph. In particular $d_1 \ge d_2 \ge \dots \ge d_n$ is the degree sequence of a graph on $n$ vertices if and only if (1) $d_1 + d_2 + \dots d_n$ is even, and (2) $$ \sum_{i=1}^k d_i \le k(k-1) + \sum_{i=k+1}^n\min (d_i, k) $$ holds for $1 \le k \le n$. Now let $\Delta$ be a $k$-dimensional simplicial complex on $n$ vertices, with a complete $(k-1)$-skeleton. I.e. $$f_{k-1} (\Delta) = {n \choose k} $$ The degree of a $(k-1)$-dimensional face of $\Delta$ is defined to be the number of $k$-dimensional faces containing it. What are the possible degree sequences $$d_1 \ge d_2 \ge \dots \ge d_{n \choose k}?$$ Clearly a necessary condition is that $(k+1)$ divides the sum $d_1 + d_2 + \dots$, but is there something analogous to condition (2) above that makes this into necessary and sufficient conditions? Is the Kruskal-Katona theorem of any help?
