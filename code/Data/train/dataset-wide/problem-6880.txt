I don't think there is right or wrong. Here is an example of what could be behind some of these arguments. Let us assume that there are two buyers in the economy: Singer and Foreman. Foreman enjoys meat but he prefers humane meat (other things equal). Let $V$ be the value that Foreman derives from a unit of humane meat and $v$ the value from normal meat. Singer is a consequentialist and has as a goal to reduce the meat consumption. Singer is willing to pay $1\$$ to reduce the total consumption of meat in unit and $\beta\$<1$$ to reduce the total consumption of humane meat. If Singer was alone, he would simply refrain from eating. Because Singer is a consequentialist he does not care who eats the meat (this simplifies the analysis). Now, suppose that there are scale economies in the production of humane meat so that the first unit costs $C$ and the second costs $C'$, while the production of normal meat has constant returns and the marginal cost is $c$. Both markets are competitive. If $V-C<v-c$, then in isolation Foreman would buy normal meat. Singer would have a disutility of $1$. If Singer buys humane meat then Foreman would do so too if $V-C'>v-c$ (which may be possible since $C'<C$). Singer would then have a disutility of $2\beta+C'$ (the price of the meat plus the total disutility of two units). If $2\beta+C'<1$, then Singer judges the world to be better if he buys humane meat and he proceeds to do so. Thus, if activists consider 'humane meat' to be much better than normal meat and there are substantial scale economies in its production, they may prefer to buy it as a way of inducing others to do the same. If they have agent-specific morality (e.g. they prefer a world in which others buy meat than a world in which they buy meat but they have the same world consumption), then participating in the humane meat market may be a less desirable option. Finally, notice that there are other ways in which Singer could improve the world. For instance, he can buy stock in humane meat consumption and swallow the losses that come from selling at a price $p=c+V-v<C$. This gives Singer a disutility of $\beta+(C-c)-(V-v)$ which is lower if $\beta$ is sufficiently high. (For simplicity I assume that Singer does not consider Foreman's consumption of utility as deserving moral praise so he does not include Foreman's extra utility in his computation. If he did, then buying humane meat would be even more desirable.) 

Prescription drug prices, like those of most other retail products, fail to satisfy the law of one price routinely. The most obvious observation is that prices differ across pharmacies at a given point in time ($URL$ but just like supermarkets give discounts, so do pharmacies. If you always buy from the same shop, you are bound to end up paying different amounts. The reasons for this are manifold. Different consumers have different abilities or willingness to store and buy large chunks when it is cheap and stochastic prices allows for price discrimination (see Sobel 84 for an early reference). The idea is simple. Myopic consumers arrive in each period and buy if $p<V$, then leave the market. Otherwise, they die. Strategic consumers have a valuation of $v<V$ but can wait if the price is above $v$. Firms compete in prices. In equilibrium, firms charge often $p=V$ to extract rents from myopic consumers but every now and then they offer $p<v$ to attract all strategic consumers looking for prices. Competition between stores may also result in random prices in a standard consumer search framework. Finally, retail prices may change because manufacturers prices are also random as a way to discipline pharmacies by encouraging consumers to shop. 

Just to add a little more intuition, recall the difference between a small open economy and a closed economy. A closed economy must consume its endowment. A small endowment, however, can borrow and lend from the rest of the world. This allows it to engage in intertemporal trade. When it borrows from the rest of the world, it does so to either increase present consumption or, in the case of a production economy, to increase investment. Thus, this leads to the equilibrium condition that at any time, the amount saved is equal to the sum of investments plus net exports (foreign money flows in to the economy), $$ NX + I = S. $$ Note, that even if we're not dealing with an endowment economy, i.e., even if the closed economy is a production economy, it is still constrained in its ability to engage in intertemporal trade. The closed economy is constrained to invest only what it saves. Hence, to take advantage of an investment opportunity, it must forgo some present consumption. 

"But if any of these control variables are endogenous to some omitted variable, doesn't this contaminate the unbiasedness of ALL the independent variables?" I don't want to emphasize this too much, but it's worth mentioning that this is not true in general. The following derivation will hopefully provide some understanding of the "contamination" you mention. As a simple counterexample, suppose that the data generating process is given by $$ Y = X_1 \beta_1 + X_2 \beta_2 + Z \gamma + \varepsilon, $$ where $Z$ is unobserved. Let $Cov(X_1,Z) = 0$, $Cov(X_2, Z) \neq 0$, and $Cov(X_1,X_2) = 0$. Then, it is clear that $X_2$ is "endogenous." But notice that because $Cov(X_1,Z) = 0$, our estimate of $\beta_1$ will still be ok: $$ \text{plim}\, \hat \beta_{1} = \beta_1 + \gamma \frac{Cov(X_1^*, Z)}{Var(X_1^*)} = \beta_1, $$ where $X_1^* = M_2 X_1$ and $M_2 = [I - X_2(X_2'X_2)^{-1}X_2']$. Because $Cov(X_1,X_2) = 0$, $X_1^* = X_1$. So $Cov(X_1^*,Z)=0$. "What can we do?" One of the mains challenges of doing good econometrics is thinking of potential identification strategies. In the type of situation you describe, there is probably nothing you can do but to try to approach the problem a different way. 

The intertemporal capital asset pricing model (ICAPM) is different from the CAPM in that in the ICAPM, utility is conditioned on some set of state variables. The ICAPM results in a multifactor pricing model of the market if investor care about hedging against changing investment opportunities and exposure to these factors. Are there any canonical examples of these factors? I know that the Fama-French multifactor models (e.g., the three factor model) are often justified on grounds of the ICAPM (or APT -- arbitrage pricing theory). What are the underlying risk factors that justify this model? Are there any other examples of underlying risk factors that show up a lot? 

He notes that "an abbreviated version appears on the Social Science Research building at the University of Chicago." So, yeah, economists (as social scientists) definitely take this seriously. So, the point is that economists are well aware of the problems in these "definitions." They are a part of ongoing research in the field; sometimes they're ignored if people don't think they're first-order to the problem; etc... 

Here are some hints. Either solve the profit function in terms of $p$, substituting out all references to $q$ (recall that $D(p) = q$), or solve the profit function in terms of $q$, substituting out all references to $p$. Then you'll find that the profit function is concave and the differentiated with respect to $p$ in the first case or $q$ in the second case will give you the profit maximizing solution. EDIT: Yeah, $a = 2q + 10$ looks correct. Just solve the equation for $q$ and the interpretation is clear. That is, the quantity produced is $q = (a - 10)/2$. If you want to know the price, then just substitute $q$ in for $D(p)$ like so: $a - p = D(p) = q = (a - 10)/2$. 

I am not sure which is your current level of understanding so tailoring the answer seems difficult. At a very basic level, the idea is as follows. Commercial banks and other institutions originate mortgages but have a preference for liquid assets and so they would rather sell them to third parties instead of keeping them in their portfolio until all the money is paid back. Because the market has to be thick, one cannot simply sell 'Fato's mortgage'. One pools together a bunch of mortgages with similar characteristics and then sells 'shares' on this pool. So far so good. The problem becomes more complicated because the optimal structure of these 'shares' is not simple equity. This is because (i) different investors have different preferences for liquidity and (ii) there are information asymmetries in the market. In general, these assets are structured into tranches. The prime tranche offers debt (a fixed payment unless there is default) and uses the first income that the mortgage originates. The last tranche is equity and is the most junior so they only get money if the mortgage is paid in full. In the middle, the mezzanine tranches, are some sort of combination between the two. These assets' returns are completely tied to the mortgages so that if the mortgages fail, some of these assets become junk. Notice also that, in principle, different people buy different tranches and the risk is spread. Furthermore, the bank does no longer have a stake in the mortgage. Securitization had many problems that people failed to foresee, or at any rate, failed to fully understand. First, precisely because the originators no longer had a stake in the game, they did not provide accurate monitoring and screening and the quality of the mortgages dropped (this is accurately captured in the movie). Second, because the assets pooled together similar mortgages, they failed to take into account the full correlation structure of the different mortgages. Third, many investors did not fully understand these complex securities and held extremely long positions on some of the original mortgages, although they had normal positions on each of the assets (e.g. Lehman Bros was extremely long in subprime mortgages although it was not extremely long on any particular asset). As it happened, if a mortgage in Florida for a 200k house for a guy with credit score such and such defaults, it is quite likely that others would do too. This makes the whole castle crumble. So back to the questions you raised at the beginning. First, if you buy the equity tranche of a mortgage (which is ex-ante very attractive) you only get paid at all if a large chunk of the mortgages in the pool are fully repaid. If a significant fraction defaults, then only the top tranches get anything and the rest get paid nothing. So it may be that you only get 5% of what you invested (but if things went well, you would get twice or more). Hope this helps. If you need some further clarification feel free to ask. I can also add some numerical examples and give some more advanced references. Wikipedia has a good set of articles on it too. 

The monopolist solves, $\max \pi=R(Q)-C(Q)=P(Q)Q-C(Q)$ The general solution is (if the problem is globally concave) $MR(Q^*)=P'(Q^*)Q^*+P(Q^*)=C'(Q^*)$. Since $P'(Q)<0$, notice that $MR(Q)<P(Q)$ and, therefore, $Q^*<Q^{C}$. In this example, we have $P(Q)=3-\frac{Q}{16000}$ and $C(Q)=Q$. Hence, $MR(Q)=-\frac{1}{160000}Q+(3-\frac{Q}{16000})=1=MC(Q)$. Rewritting, we get $3-\frac{Q}{8000}=1$ or $Q=16000$. To compute the price simply substitute in the demand function and get $P(16000)=3-1=2>1$. 

I do not understand your attempt very well. Assuming that the monopolist cannot directly price discriminate (i.e. charge different prices to old and new consumers in the same period), then in the second period it is optimal to offer a price of 50 and sell to everyone, regardless of whether the old guy bought or not. Knowing this, the old guy would buy in the first period iff the price gives him a total surplus of 50 (which he can get by waiting). Hence, the initial price should be 150. If, on the other hand, the old guy has a value of only 20, then in the second period the monopoly price would still be 50. Hence, the old guy has no surplus from waiting and the monopolist should charge 40 to him in the first period.
