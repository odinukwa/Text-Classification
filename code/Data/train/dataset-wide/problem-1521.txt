We clearly see that we are inside a disk, since what we see when we look around us is a disk seen edge-on. It does not look like an ellipsoid or any other shape; it looks like a disk. The Milky Way has arms The other strong clue we have is the velocity of stars of the Milky Way, we can measure. First, we see an overall rotational motions, and, when you look closely to the patterns (like in the following image, that is observations in the radio range of the Milky Way at Green Bank Observatory), you can deduce that stars are even ordered into spirals: 

And, as far as I know, in lots of countries/universities, you can find at least few astronomy & astrophysics courses. In some countries, you can even find dedicated master degrees. With all of that, you'll be ready to start a PhD in astronomy to become a professional astronomer. 

No, not really. Stars can form in circumstellar disks, that are, in general, disks surrounding forming stars, but not in protoplanetary disks. Protoplanetary disks are, by definition, flat, rotationing disks composed of gas and dust, found around newly born low-mass stars (see the review by Williams & Cieza (2011)). There are two important point in this definition: protoplanetary disks orbit around low-mass stars, and, in particular, newly-born low-mass stars. These two points are important, because at this stage of the life of the disk and for this range of stellar mass, its mass it clearly too small to form any star. That being said, it is not impossible to form stars in the protostellar disk of a forming star (that is one of the possibility to form multiple systems, that are still hard to explain), as discussed by various authors (see, for example Stamatellos et al. (2009), Vorobyov et al. (2013), Joos et al. (2013) and many others), but it is more likely to form brown dwarfs of very low-mass stars in these disks than main sequence stars (their mass is simply too small, once again). That being said (bis repetita), you could, as pointed out by called2voyage, you could form a main sequence star in the circumstellar disk of a high-mass star (as a Wolf-Rayet type star). 

Determination As you see, all these IMF are parametrization, deduced from observations. In general, the observations used to infer these mass functions come from star clusters in our galaxy. All you need to do it is to find a mass-magnitude relationship to deduce, from an observed luminosity, a mass function. In general, the number density distribution per mess interval, ${\rm d}n/{\rm d}m$, takes the following form $$\frac{{\rm d}n}{{\rm d}m}\left(m\right)_\tau = \left(\frac{{\rm d}n}{{\rm d}M_\lambda(m)}\right) \times \left(\frac{{\rm d}m}{{\rm d}M_\lambda(m)}\right)^{-1}_\tau,$$ for a given age $\tau$ and an observed magnitude $M_\lambda$. Then, it is just a matter of parametrization, but also of how well it can arise from a proper theory. For this matter, the Chabrier's IMF is probably the one that is best back up by theoretical arguments. It relies on a gravo-turbulent theory, taking into account all the possible supports (thermal support, turbulent support and magnetic support) plus the dual nature of turbulence, that both favors star formation by compressing the gas, and impedes star formation, by dispersing the fluid. All the dirty details are given in Hennebelle & Chabrier (2008) and Hennebelle & Chabrier (2009), showing how you can analytically deduce an IMF from these theoretical considerations. Applications As far as I know, these IMF are more or less used for every type of population. However, you won't favor Salpeter's IMF if you have enough resolution to resolve low-mass objects, that are not at all well-taken into account with this IMF. You should also favor the Chabrier's system IMF in case of unresolved objects. To know if all these IMFs are really well-suited to any kind of population is an open and difficult question (the so-called question of the universality of the IMF), in particular because you need to resolve individual stars in clearly identified clusters to deduce an IMF. There are some papers investigating the question (for example, you could have a look at Cappellari et al. (2012) for a recent discussion of the problem). 

Rotation: One of the easiest way to show that galaxies rotates are Doppler observations of atomic or molecular lines. For example, if the observed galaxy is seen edge-on and rotates clockwise, the left side of the galaxy is going away from you, and is then Doppler-shifted in the red. The right side, going toward you, is Doppler-shifted in the blue. This kind of observations was realized already in the '60, in radio. The spiral patern observed in spiral galaxies is also a clear signature of their rotation. Note that spiral are linked to density waves in the galactic disk (see for example Lin & Shu 1964). Direction: As for their directions, you can convinced yourself that there is no tendency, just looking at this Hubble telescope gallery. You can also think that galaxies probably rotate by angular momentum conservation during their formation history, and that it highly dependent on initial conditions, that are clearly random. 

On this question, the Widrow (2002) review is still pretty up-to-date. You can also have a look on the introduction of Beck (2013), a recent PhD thesis on the subject with a straightfoward introduction to the subject. The main questions remain the same for decades now: 

Magnetic fields is well-suited to launch such outflows, through magneto-centrifugal effects. Basically, if there is magnetic fields tighed to the disk surrounding the protostar and the angle between the field lines and the disk is right, a particle from the disk that follows the magnetic field lines can be ejected. This is the well-known Blandford & Payne (1982) mechanism. Note that, at earlier stages of star formation, magnetic field could also trigger outflows by a "magnetic field tower" growth. Basically, during the collapse of the prestellar core into a protostar, the field lines are dragged and twisted (due to the rotation of the core), the twist propagating from the inner to the outer region of the core, that triggers outflows. This kind of thing is discussedd in Hennebelle & Fromang (2008). By the way, these two mechanisms are complementary, because slow outflows (of the order of 10 km s$^{-1}$) are observed around young protostar, whereas "fast outflows" -- jets, of the order of 100 km s$^{-1}$ -- are observed around late protostars, and these two mechanisms explained well the former and the later. For more massive stars, radiation pressure will plays a role in outflows triggering. The protostar radiates away a part of its accreting energy, and strong a radiation pressure can trigger the growth of a kind of "bubble", that is an outflow (you can see Hennebelle & Commerçon (2012) for a brief review of the question). Regarding your comment on your own question, it is mostly radiation pressure that will clear up the gas around the new-born star, that is clearly not an outflow or anything alike. 

One way to look at this problem is to consider angular momentum. The Earth spins around its axis, and has therefore some angular momentum by itself. The angular momentum is proportional to the mass of the Earth, to its squared radius, and to its angular velocity. But the Earth is not alone; it has the Moon rotating around that adds angular momentum to the Earth-Moon system. And, even though the Moon is not as massive as the Earth (it is about 100 times less massive), nor rotates very fast around the Earth (and therefore a lesser angular velocity), it has a large orbit (about 300 000 km) and overall, it adds to the system an amount of angular momentum comparable to that of the Earth itself. Now, think of a spinning-top: the faster it rotates (and thus the larger the angular momentum), the more stable it is. It is the same for the Earth-Moon system: without the Moon, the angular momentum of the Earth itself would be such that gravitational perturbations could be sufficient, in the long run, to perturbates significantly its axis (exactly like the spinning-top: if it does not rotate very fast, a small perturbation will rapidely increases and the spinning-top axis will start to oscillate more and more). But with the Moon, the global angular momentum of the system is larger, and it is therefore harder to pertubate sufficiently the system to get it oscillate strongly. Sources: For those who wants the dirty details, you can have a look at Laskar et al. 1993. 

The Larson's relation shows the evolution of the velocity dispersion with the size of the structure you're looking at. Velocity dispersion is an indicator of turbulence. Indeed, these dispersions are non-thermal: knowing the typical temperature of the MIS (about 10 K), one can estimate the thermal velocity of, for example, the CO molecule ($v_th = \sqrt{2kT/\mu m_H}$, with $k$ the Boltzman constant, $T$ the temperature, $\mu$ the mean molecular wright and $m_H$ the hydrodgen atom mass) that is about 0.07 km s$^{-1}$. Measured velocity dispersions are of the order of 1 to 10 km s$^{-1}$, and these is interpreted as a turbulence signature (and estimate). Details: Energy rates: values are given (roughly) for the Milky Way 

Big picture: The reason why there are planets so close to their host star is probably planetary migration. These planets are difficult to explain by in situ formation models (first of all there is not enough material to form that kind of massive objects in these regions). There are different theories to explain planetary migration: 

Elements of answer: It is not an easy question, as we lack of data to constrain strongly the density and mass of Saturn's rings. However, a first clue of their density is their optical depth (that is a measure of the transparency of a medium). The densest rings are the one of the main ring system (rings A, Cassini Division, B and C) plus ring F; they are characterized by optical depth larger than 0.1 (up to about 5 for the densest part of ring B). Rings in the faint ring system (E and G) have very small optical depth (lower than $10^{-5}$). With this regard, B is indeed the densest ring of Saturn's rings. (edit) Looking around ([1] and [2]) you can find numbers that help to figure out the density of this ring. Knowing its mass (about $2.8\times10^9$ kg) and its extend (from 1.527 to 1.951 Saturn radii, with a typical thickness of 100 m), you can deduce a mean density of about 0.0167 g.m$^{-3}$ (about $10^5$ times less dense than the terrestrial atmosphere at sea level). Just for fun: This gives you an idea of what means the optical depth. In the densest parts of ring B, optical depth is between 2.5 and 5, so you'll definitely notice you're in the ring. It is probably more complicated than that (with ring particles ranging from dust size to house size), but you get the idea. 

You can find all kind of objects, like stars, planetary nebulæ etc. But it is mostly a hot, ionized void. How void? The density of the intergalactic medium is about 1 to 100 particles per cubic meter (you can compare it to the mean galactic density, of about a million particles per cubic meter, or that of Earth's atmosphere, of about 10^26 particles cubic meter). How hot? It can go from 10^5 to 10^7 K. Fun thing is, even though it is "very empty", is contains however most of the baryons (the "classical matter") of the Universe, if you consider that only 5-10% of the total mass of baryons is enclosed in stars and galaxies. 

You can use VizieR to retrieve the whole catalogue (3C and revised 3C). VizieR is an online astronomical catalogue that allows you to access a quite comprehensive list of catalogues (16,929, as of today); you can easily query and extract all kind of data from this online tool. 

It is then quite challenging to observe molecules in this region. Good news is, there is not only molecular lines to give informations about the physical properties (temperature, density, ionization, velocity structure and morphology) of the Local Interstellar Cloud. In particular, ultraviolet is a perfectly suited wavelength range to sudy this region in absorption, and there are some quite extensive studies of the subject (see for example Paper I, Paper II, Paper III and Paper IV of Redfield et al.). 

There is no direct evidence of change of orbits of the gaseous planets of the Solar System. But one could wonder about the stability of the Solar System, and if such events could happen again. Theory: The Solar System is a chaotic system, as most of gravitational systems involving $N$ bodies. The KAM theorems (for Kolmogorov, Arnold and Moser, the three authors of the theory) show that, for non-degenerate Hamiltonian systems, quasiperiodic trajectories exist, that could ensure the stability of the system. But unfortunatly the KAM theorems cannot be applied to the Solar System, because the planets are too massive. Simulations: It leaves us with numerical simulations, that show that the Solar System is indeed chaotic, and that planetary collisions, ejection and migration can happen. But if it is true for the telluric planets, it is not the case for the gaseous planets: one reason could be that they are not much perturbated by the inner planets. Sources: 

The main flaw with your definition of a "generalised planet" would be the boundary between stars and planets. And, in particular, the status of brown dwarfs, that are kind of "failed stars", that could not start to burn their hydrodgen. With this regard, the definition of a planet as it is now is probably the best one (or the less worst one), because it is then possible to draw a line between planets and stars (and in particular brown dwarfs), because a planet is then an object formed by accretion in the debris material of a forming/newly formed star, whereas a star is, in general, an independent object formed by collapse and accretion (there are now observations of forming brown dwarfs; see for example the review by Luhman (2102) or the recent paper by André et al. (2012)). So you have two types of celestrial objects, well defined by two types of formation mechanisms (core accretion for the planets vs. gravo-turbulent collapse for the stars (brown dwarfs included). Then you can also clearly distinguish between "real" free-floating planets (that are then planets expelled from their orbit and floating around in the galaxy) and brown dwarfs (that form independently, where they lay). Bottom line: if your object, in any environment (including any type of accretion disk) is form by core accretion: it is a planet. If your object is form by gravitational collapse (with a later, unavoidable phase of accretion onto the central object): it is a star.
