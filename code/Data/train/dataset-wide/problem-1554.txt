One of the caveats to this question is that often one object, say a star, will have multiple names or "designations"" for example, one of the most famous stars I can think of (and, as it happens, one of my favourite) is Vega. Vega is also known as $\alpha$-Lyrae, being the brightest star in the constellation of Lyra. This is known as a Bayer designation: whereby the most of the brighter stars were assigned their first systematic names such as alpha ($\alpha$), beta ($\beta$), gamma ($\gamma$), etc. in order of brightness. The Vega name is the Latin name of the star’s parent constellation in genitive (possessive) form. The entirity of Vega's other designations and names are: Wega, Lucida Lyrae, Alpha Lyrae, α Lyrae, 3 Lyr, GJ 721, HR 7001, BD +38°3238, HD 172167, GCTP 4293.00, LTT 15486, SAO 67174, HIP 91262, 织女一. So you can see, there is really multiple names for one object on the sky, depending on which catalogue you use! 

This question relates to a diffuse hot gas halo of our Milky Galaxy. I've read that there is a hot diffuse halo of gas surrounding our Galaxy (NED, Caltech) I was wondering why such a halo can exist? Why doesn't it collapse to a disk shape? Is it because the gas itself is still hot and so remains largely unaffected by the Galaxy potential? 

Just a quick question relating to the thermal Blackbody temperature of a celestial object. In the c.g.s regime of astrophysics, is it more 'sophisticated' to quote the thermal Blackbody temperature in units of Kelvin ($\mathrm{K}$) or in units of $\mathrm{keV}$? That is to say to use $k_{B}T_{\mathrm{bb}}$ and convert to an energy? 

I'm designing an amateur astronomy observational plan for GCSE Astronomy students here in the UK. I would like some advise to the suitability of what I have selected as the content. 

I'm quite certain that there isn't any actual images of a transitory event of Jupiter or Saturn across the solar disk from say e.g.,s the Voyager probe, Pioneer 10/11 or even recent New Horizons mission? Another related question I have, what would the approximate transit of Jupiter look like as seen from Saturn. The distance between Saturn and Jupiter is approximately 4-5AU, and the diameter of Jupiter is one tenth that of the Sun's. Are we looking at perhaps a transit which covers 10-15% of the solar disk? N.B. Please note I understand that to observe a transit of Jupiter we have to be superior to it in the Solar System, hence I am asking for images taken by deep Solar System probes only. 

The large basin forms, from either a crater or some other process. The mesa and ridge form, possibly as a result of the erosion of some larger feature. Craters form through impacts. One happens to be on the mesa itself. 

When we look at spectral lines in a star's spectrum, we're actually looking for absorption lines, not emission lines. A star's spectrum usually resembles that of a black body, continuous and smooth. However, there are elements in the star's atmosphere that absorb some of the emitted light; these create characteristic absorption lines in the spectrum we observe. There's a reason that a star's spectrum closely resembles that of a black body. H- opacity means that some of the solar photosphere is optically thick for a wide range of frequencies. This in turn means that the emission no longer comes from just a few frequencies corresponding to a few elements. This spectrum appears continuous, and therefore like a black body. 

I would wager that the reason Mercury and the Moon can get so cold is because they don't really have atmospheres. Over the course of a day, Earth's atmosphere heats up a bit, and over night, it retains that heat, meaning that the surface can stay relatively warm. Mercury's atmosphere is extremely tenuous. The same goes for the Moon. This might not be an issue, but one day on Mercury lasts 59 Earth days. One day on the Moon lasts for about one Earth month. This means that while there's time to trap some heat, there's also the same amount of time to lose it, and without an atmosphere, the heat gained is soon be lost. 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko also doesn't have an atmosphere to speak of, but it rotates quickly - rotating once every ~12.5 hours. This isn't necessarily perpendicular to the orbital plane, so not every part of it will face the Sun during a rotation, but it does mean that there's not as much time to lose heat. 

The oldest light in the universe is the cosmic microwave background. Roughly 380,000 years after the Big Bang, protons and electrons "recombined"1 into hydrogen atoms. Before this, any photons scattered off the free electrons in the plasma filling space, and the universe was essentially opaque to light. Once recombination occurred, however, photons were able to "decouple" from the electrons and move through space unimpeded. This relic radiation is still observable today; it has been redshifted and cooled. We can detect light from very distant objects, and we have. It makes more sense to talk about distance in terms of redshift; the larger the redshift, the farther away an object is. There are a number of extremely high-redshift objects, some of which have had their measurements confirmed, and others of which have not. Candidates include 

Just more of a conceptual question on the mutual inclusivity of the cosmological principle. That is to say, I was wondering if it were possible to have a Universe that were isotropic but NOT homogeneous OR a Universe that were homogeneous but NOT isotropic. My spidey sense is telling me that it is possible that a Universe could be istropic but not homoegenous. Surely, by default, if a Universe is homogenous then it follows that it has to be isotropic? 

Sirius is in Canis Major, and if you take the belt of Orion to be the reference point then we can proceed as follows. If we define Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka as going left to right as we perceive it to be in the Northern Hemisphere, then we need to draw a line going from Mintaka in a SW-ish (left and down) orientation through Alnitak to Canis Major. You should see it. It's coming up to the best time of year to see Sirius and the Orion constellation. N.B. I'm pretty certain what you are referring to as the object you're seeing at this present moment is Venus. 

I have a homework assignment question on accretions discs (essentially an estimation of the number of electron scatterings, but this is just for background). There are a few parameters, one of them being $L$, which is the linear size of the medium (the medium in this case being an accretion disc around a blackhole) Now, I have been given the mass of the black hole. Other than that, nothing else which could give me the linear size of the accretion disc. Could I assume that the linear extent of the accretion disc is perhaps of the order of a few Schwarzschild radii? Which could be calculated from the mass, which is given. If anyone could shed some light on this I would be very appreciative. I need a nudge in the right direction on this. 

I would hazard a guess at this point, but effects of gravitational red-shift would perhaps average out, so approximately 50% of light would orginate from objects with stronger gravitational fields and 50% from weaker gravitational fields. Hence, we would see blue-shifted and red-shifted objects if gravitational redshift is an prominent as assumed. However, with the exception of the local group (where due to being gravitationally bound M33, Andromeda and ourselves are all moving towards each other), most of the extragalactic objects we observe have a redshift. Hence, the Doppler effect must be dominating. 

At this point in time, though, all evidence indicates that Mercury has a molten core. As userLTK pointed out, lower pressure inside Mercury makes it easier for the core to stay liquid at lower temperatures. 

I'm not sure I'd describe any of Hubble's other achievements as "revolutionary", though it has an amazing track record. NASA discusses some of Hubble's successes here, including the discovery of black holes and supermassive black holes in other galaxies; see this paper and this paper. There's also a decent page here that discusses those discoveries. One last field is planet formation, one area of study that's been hot recently. This is one of the better links from that NASA page. 

I may have to answer this in parts, a bit at a time, so I apologize if I'm not able to answer everything at the moment. 

2 Technically, this is from about 0.0016 solar radii, but this distance step is comparatively small. 

I'm getting a slightly different figure from space.com (not my favorite source, but a source nonetheless), which says 

I'm unsure of the reason behind the $^3\text{He}$ spike; that may warrant a follow-up questions. My one guess is that this could be due to its role as an intermediate nucleus in the second step of the p-p chain. However, the same trends for each element are followed, although the changes in mass fraction are not constant at all radii $r$. As for your question about how the central figures were derived, the answer is that helioseismological measurements and neutrino fluxes are some of the best indicators of composition. This was used as the basis for the BS05(AGS, OP) and BS05(OP) models, as well as, in fact, most variants of the Standard Solar Model. 

I'm working with some equations to model the evolution of a circumstellar disk. One of the equations is $$\rho(r)=Ce^{-\frac{(r-r_{peak})^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}$$ where $\rho$ is density, $r$ is the distance from the center, $C$ is a constant, $\sigma$ is one standard deviation, and $r_{peak}$ is the radius at which the density is at a maximum. If the function was of the form $$\rho(r)=Ce^{f(r)}$$ where $f(r)$ is a function of $r$, I could find the maximum easily by finding $$\rho'(r)=Cf'(r)e^{f(r)}=0$$ and solving for $r$. However, this appears to be impossible in the current case because $\rho(r)_{peak}$ is already in the equation, at $r_{peak}$. How is $r_{peak}$ determined in a given scenario? Is it determined experimentally?
