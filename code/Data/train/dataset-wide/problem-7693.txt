The book of Goldberg and Ostrovskii MR2435270 contains several examples of functions whose deficient value is not asymptotic. And in fact there are such functions without asymptotic values at all. But deficient value must be in the closure of the singular set. This follows from a theorem of E. Collingwood, which has many generalizations, by Tumura, H. Selberg, Kakutani and H. Cartan. You can find one generalization as Theorem 1.2 in Chapter 7 of Goldberg - Ostrovskii. In particular, for a function of class $S$, only singular values can be deficient. If you search carefully, you can find this book on the Internet. 

For every holomorphic map from the complex plane to the Riemann sphere, and every $R<\arccos(1/3)$ there exists a disk of radius $R$ in the image in which an inverse holomorphic branch exists. (The constant is best possible). 

The answer for connected 2-dimensional orbifolds is no. Euler characteristic is $$\chi(O)=\chi(M)-\sum\left(1-\frac{1}{q}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\sum\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right),$$ where $p,q\geq 2$ are integers, and $\chi(M)$ is the characteristic of the surface of the orbifold. It immediately follows that $\chi(O)\leq 2$ for all 2D orbiforlds, and as $1-1/q\geq 1/2$, $1-1/p\geq 1/2$, most rational numbers will never occur (on any closed interval which does not contain half-integers, there are only finitely many of these numbers). 

Existence of real solutions of systems of algebraic equation is a difficult problem and there is no general theory. You can get an impression of the modern state of it from the nice book: MR2830310 Sottile, Frank, Real solutions to equations from geometry. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2011. Also this one: MR1925796 Sturmfels, Bernd, Solving systems of polynomial equations. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2002. Only some very special systems can be presently studied. That all equations are of degree 2 does not help much. But if you write your system, perhaps it is of the special kind about which something is known. 

Yes, this is so, sometimes. The prime example in the unit disc $|z|<1$ in the complex plane. This is a $1$-dimensional complex analytic manifold. Its automorphism group is a $3$-parametric group which is isomorphic to $PSL_2(R)$. In the unit disc there is a Riemannian metric, which is called the Poincare metric and for which the isometries are exactly the automorphisms. Now by the uniformization theorem, almost all Riemann surfaces have the unit disc as the universal cover. It follows that for almost all Riemann surfaces there is such a metric, that your equality holds. It is called the hyperbolic metric. (Exceptional Riemann surfaces are the sphere, the plane the punctured plane and the complex $1$-parametric family of tori.) Some of this extends to complex manifolds in higher dimension. The analog of the hyperbolic metric is called the Kobayashi metric, and it is believed that "most" complex manifolds have it, though this is difficult to prove in sprecific cases. Moreover, Kobayashi metric is frequently not a Riemannian (Hermirtian) metric but only a Finsler metric. Much about this can be found in the books of S. Kobayashi. 

It depends on the meaning of the closed form. Multiplication on $t^p$ is equivalent to convolution of Laplace transform with the Laplace transform of $t^p$, which gives you an integral formula. See "fractional calculus" on Wikipedia, for examle. 

The answer depends on the point $p$ and on the body. Here is a simple counterexample in $R^3$. Take two regular hexagons in parallel planes, so that the line $L$ connecting their centers is perpendicular to these planes. One hexagon is obtained from another by rotation by 30 degrees about the center and parallel translation along the line $L$. The body is the convex hull of the union of the hexagons. The illumination source is somewhere on $L$. I suppose this is simpler that Joseph's example. 

Some other books of Klein (Fricke-Klein on authomorphic functions, his Lectures on hypergeometric functions) have a lot of excellent pictures. From reading many old mathematical books I cannot conclude that there was any trend or fashion that changed with time or from country to country. The explanation why some books have pictures and others do not is probably simpler: it always was (and still is!) very difficult to make good pictures. At the time of Klein, a skilled engraver had to be hired. Reproduction of the pictures probably substantially increased the cost of printing. In our time, many mathematicians (including myself) do not know appropriate tools, and don't want to spend time required to produce good quality pictures. Reproduction of old pictures in new editions of the same books is probably also enormously difficult and expensive. 

Take any polynomial $P$ of degree $n$ with $n$ distinct roots. The curve $|P(z)|^2=\epsilon$, where $z=x+iy$, is algebraic and has $n$ components when $\epsilon$ is small enough. This curve is called a lemniscate. 

Such books are abundant. My favorite ones are Z. Nitecki, Differentiable dynamics, and J. Palis, W. de Melo, Geometric theory of dynamical systems. An introduction, Springer-Verlag, New York-Berlin, 1982. 

Here is a question of classical function theory of this sort. Let $f$ be an entire function of one variable. Consider all factorizations $f=g\circ h$ where $g$ and $h$ are entire. Two factorizations $f=g_1\circ h_1$ and $f=g_2\circ h_2$ are called equivalent if there is a polynomial $L$ of degree $1$ such that $g_2=g_1\circ L$ and $h_2=L^{-1}\circ h_1$. 

The statement is not correct. A bigger sphere has smaller curvature. Half of a sphere is a conformal disk. 

First of all, the Riemann-Hurwitz formula with $\chi<0$ implies that for every self-covering $d=1$ so it is an automorphism. The only punctured surfaces with $\chi\geq 0$ are torus, sphere, and sphere with one or two punctures. For torus and sphere with two punctures self-coverings are easy to describe, for the rest, they are just automorphisms. On the other hand the group of holomorphic automorphisms when $\chi<0$ is finite, and a generic Riemann surface has none. If you mean just topological self-coverings, then you can construct them. All compact surfaces of given genus $g$ are homeomorphic. Take one which has holomorphic automorphisms and transplant them to your surface. The number of holomorphic automorphisms of a surface of genus $g>1$ is at most $84g$. 

For every $n$ and for every regular region (in the sense of Dirichlet problem), it is easy to construct a harmonic function in $L^\infty$ that does not extend to any larger open set. Just solve the Dirichlet problem with a continuous nowhere differentiable boundary data. If the boundary has irregular points, for example an isolated point, such extension is sometimes possible, depending on $n$ and $p$. One can make an exact statement about $n$ and $p$ for this kind of "removable singularity theorem", if this is what you really want. For example, if $p=\infty$, closed sets of zero capacity are removable, but closed sets of positive capacity are not. 

"Vojta's analogy" between Nevanlinna theory and Diophantine approximation. Nevanlinna theory studies holomorphic curves from the affine line $C$ to complex projective space $P^n$ (or to other complex manifolds). The main characteristic of such a curve is called the Nevanlinna characteristic. It was introduced by H. Cartan (for the case of projective space) in 1929. Almost simultaneously, heights was introduced to number theory by Weil and Siegel (1928). Some people noticed the similarity of these two notions, but only in 1987, Vojta started to explore this similarity systematically. The result was very profitable for both theories. 

For the case when $f$ has compact support, this is due to B. Logan, Properties of high-pass signals, (Thesis, Dept. Electrical Engineering, Columbia Univ. 1965), for the general case, Eremenko and Novikov, Oscillation of Fourier integrals with a spectral gap, J. de Math. Pures et Appl., 8, 3 (2004), 313-365, $URL$ which also reproduces Logan's elementary proof for the case of compact support. (If $f$ is a measure with finite support at the integers, this is a classical theorem of Ch. Sturm). 

Let $f$ be an analytic function, and suppose that we want to compute $f(x)$. The input consists of the digits of $x$ and the output of a rational number approximating $f(x)$. A function $f$ is called easy if there is an algorithm which computes $f(x)$ with accuracy $2^{-n}$ using $n^{1+o(1)}$ arithmetic operations. It is known that elementary functions like $e^x,\log x$ are easy. 

In the standard terminology, a Paley-Wiener function is a Fourier transform of a function from $L^2$ with compact support. The simplest formula for a Paley-Wiener function is $\phi(x)=(\sin x)/x$. This is the Fourier transform of the characteristic function of an interval. But you seem to have some unusual definition of a Paley Wiener function, though you do not state precisely what your "test functions" are. If you mean infinitely differentiable functions with compact support, take an infinite product of the form $\prod \phi(a_kx)$ where $a_k$ is an appropriately chosen sequence of real numbers tending to $0$. I don't think there is a simpler form, without an infinite product or an integral.

Here is an incomplete list of pre-1900 books that I read, enjoyed and strongly recommend (I apologize for some repetitions): 

There are many conjectures about harmonic functions in $R^n$ which are open. Not surprisingly, most of them are very hard. Even about harmonic polynomials in $R^3$ there are many unsolved problems. For example: 

More precisely: Let $f:R^n\to R^n$ be a distance decreasing homeomorphism, whose restriction on each $K_j$ is an isometry onto $f(K_j)$. Is it true that $r_j(f(K_0),f(K_1))\leq r_j(K_0,K_1)$ for each $j$? Same question can be asked with more than two sets, but there are counterexamples with many balls $K_j$, even of equal radii: this is called a "Faraday cage". Comments. This problem originates in the attempts of biologists to explain why certain animals (like armadillos) group close together when they sleep. In this model, $K_j$ are the animals with body temperature $1$, while the medum has temperature $0$. Then $u$ is the time independent temperature near the bodies, and $r_j$ is the rate of heat loss. Presumably moving closer together desceases the rates of heat loss $r_j$. It is easy to prove that the TOTAL heat loss of the group $r_1+r_2$ decreases when we move animals $K_1$ and $K_2$ closer together, see $URL$ and references there. But each individual animal $K_j$ feels only his own $r_j$, not the sum. Also some condition of convexity type is indeed needed here; think of a kangaroo putting her child in the bag. This decreases the heat loss by the child but (slightly) increases the cooling rate of the mother. The problem is unsolved even when $K_0$ and $K_1$ are two balls of different radii. In this case one can obtain $r_k$ as infinite series of functions of the distance, but these series are alternate and it is unclear how to show that they are monotone. EDIT. By "Faraday cage" I mean the following. Take a spherical shell of the form $1-r\leq |x|\leq 1$, $r$ is small, and break it into little convex pieces of size approximately $r$, with some space between pieces. These pieces are $n$ animals. The temperature they create is approximately the same as the shell itself would create, which is almost constant $1$ inside, and almost $1/|x|$ outside. Consider a new animal of the same size outside. It slighely decreases the heat loss by some animals on the shell close to it. Now move the same animal inside. It will have no effect at all on the shell animals. This is the same principle as kangaroo bag, I just broke the bag into many small convex pieces. More careful argument shows that the animals can be balls of the same radius here. (Faraday's own cage does the same with electric field which satisfies the same equation). 

Any closed set of zero logarithmic capacity can be the complement of a projection of an analytic set in $C^2$ to $C$, MR0369724 Alexander, H. On a problem of Julia. Duke Math. J. 42 (1975), 327–332. 

Of course, you cannot put $\epsilon=0$ under the integral. You must evaluate it for $\epsilon\neq 0$ and then pass to the limit. The correct way to find this integral is to spread it from $-\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$, using that your function is even, and then make the change of the variable $z=\exp(ix)$. This will reduce to an integral of a rational function over a closed contour, $|z|=1$ (because $\sin^2$ has period $\pi$) which is then easy to evaluate.

If I understood the problem correctly, your conditions say $$f''+af'+bf=0$$ with some constants $a,b$. This is a linear differential equation, so $f(t)=ue^{\lambda t}$, where $u\in R^4$, and $\lambda$ is found from the characteristic equation $$-\lambda^2+a\lambda+b=0.$$ If the characterictic equation has two roots then $$f=ue^{\lambda_1t}+ve^{\lambda_2t},$$ If it has a multiple root then $$f(t)=(u+vt)e^{\lambda t}.$$ We found all solutions because $u$ and $v$ can be arbitrary vectors. In both cases $f$ lies in a $2$-dimensional subspace (spanned by $u$ and $v$.) The argument is independent of the dimension of the space. 

The standard reference is Hormander, An introduction to complex analysis in several variables. This is somewhat dense. An introduction for beginners (in one complex variable) is Berenstein, Carlos A.; Gay, Roger Complex variables. An introduction, Springer 1976. 

Your guess is wrong. Take real $f$, for example, then harmonic extension is also real, and its derivative is singular. In general, I do not expect a simple answer. And certainly the answer cannot depend on the local properties of $f$ near $\zeta$ only. Indeed, leave $f$ unchanged on one half of the circle, but change it on another half. It is clear that the derivative at the points of the first half will change. So the limit of the derivative at a point cannot be computed from the knowledge of f only near this point. 

Solutions of many (almost all) important differential (and functional) equations are analytic. For example, all elementary and special functions arise in this way. Moreover, they are also usually analytic functions of parameters. Harmonic analysis. Fourier (Laplace) transforms. This includes generating functions as a special case. They are in many cases analytic. 

In two dimensions, you have a powerful tool, the Riemann mapping. If you have a compact set in the plane whose complement is connected, knowing explicitly the map of the complement onto the exterior of the unit disk gives you the log capacity. Now take a book on complex variables with many examples of conformal maps, and you can calculate capacities of many planar sets. I recommend the book by L. Volkovyskii, A collection of problems in complex analysis, there is an English Dover edition, which is a real encyclopedia of explicit conformal maps. (If you can read some Russian, there is another book: M. A. Evgrafov, Problems in the theory of analytic functions). All examples given in the paper that you cite can be obtained with this method. For the disc, ellipse and the segment the conformal map is the Joukowski function, for the square and triangle use a modified Schwarz-Christoffel formula, and it leads to Gamma function. (All this is covered in the book of Volkovyskii cited above. You can easily generalize the last two examples to regular $n$-gons with any $n$. The answer is in terms of Gamma function; it is written in Polya, Szego, Isoperimetric problems of mathematical Physics. It is more difficult in dimension 3 and higher (Newtonian potential). A good collection of explicitly computed capacities is contained in the book N. S. Landkof, Foundations of modern potential theory (there is an English translation). EDIT. Here are some detail for the regular $n$-gon. We want to map the exterior region onto the exterior of the unit disk so that $\infty\to\infty$ by a function $f$. To do this, break the exterior region into $n$ congruent triangles with one vertex at infinity, and other two vertices the adjacent vertices of the polygon. The interior angles of a triangle are $2\pi/n$ at $\infty$ and $\pi/2+\pi/n$ at finite vertices. Now map one of these triangles onto the sector $\{ z: |\arg z|<\pi/n, |z|>1\}$. So that $\infty\to\infty$ and other two vertices go to $e^{\pm i\pi/n}$. By the symmetry principle this function will have an analytic continuation to the whole exterior and map it onto the exterior of the unit disk, so it is our $f$. The required map of the triangle onto a sector is performed with the Schwarz-Christoffel formula, and the integral which is involved is reduced to the Gamma-function. Then $f(z)\sim az,\;z\to\infty$ and capacity is $1/|a|$. 

As Denis Chaperon de Lauzières says, the precise answer to this question is given by the Beurling-Malliavin theorems. They give a very precise characterization of weights $w\geq 1$ for which there exists a Fourier transform $f$ of a function with bounded support, such that $f(x)w(x)$ is bounded. The necessary condition is that $$\int \frac{\log w(x)}{1+x^2}dx<\infty.$$ This is the famous "Logarithmic integral". To make it also sufficient one needs some regularity. For example, if $\log w$ is uniformly continuous then this is also sufficient. Another regularity condition is that $w$ is itself a functon of exponential type with $$\int\frac{\log^+|w(x)|}{1+x^2}dx<\infty.$$ References: Beurling-Malliavin, Acta math. 107 (1962) 291-309, P.
