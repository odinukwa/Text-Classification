For anyone who wants a further explanation and/or could tell how many mistakes I made there: Yes, I'm aware that there were mistakes in that incomplete explanation. I didn't properly explain vacuum energy or an energy state, nor did I discuss stability or even properly touch on quantum fields. But quite frankly, I don't think this explanation needs that baggage. Does it add to the richness of the concept? Yes. But is it confusing? Also yes. I don't think working that in would be productive. 

Even better, though, is an actual list of some of the closest approaches of comets to Earth. The closest one listed, Comet Lexell in 1770, came 0.0151 AU away from Earth. The list only shows 20 comets have come with 0.1 AU of Earth. So Earth has not had a close encounter with a comet (like Mars is having) in a long time, if ever. This site says that C/1491 came within an incredible 0.0094 AU in 1491, but I'll take the IAU site over it. And it does admit that that comet has an uncertain orbit, so that figure could be wrong. But when comets come even a tiny bit near to Earth, there are some articles written about them. See here and here. As for the distances to famous comets: Closest Ever 

After a bit of searching, I found this blog page, which has several charts about various observatories, including this one: 

I advise, once again, that you look at the Wikipedia articles on both concepts to start learning more (especially the sections on evidence). Physics and Astronomy have plenty of good information. arXiv has many pre-prints that may be helpful. And there are lots of books, magazines, and (reputable) web sites that can give you even more detailed information. 

There is no evidence for planets beyond TRAPPIST-1h. The evolutionary history of the system is unclear. It is thought that stars like TRAPPIST-1 - termed "ultracool dwarfs" - could have rocky planets around them, but they would have to have formed beyond the frost line, in the region where volatiles exist. They would then have migrated inwards, falling into orbital resonances. Any putative gas giant would need to have an orbital history consistent with such an evolution. Astronomers have not observed any other objects in the system - exomoons or exocomets included - so we do not have a good idea of what small bodies may exist in the system, and thus how they might impact life on the planets. 

I've written an answer or two dealing with this within the last week, and I can't believe I never thought about this. Great question. 

Let me elaborate on the terms isobaric and isochoric. In thermodynamics, it is sometimes convenient to assume that some thermodynamic variables remain constant in a certain situation. Isothermal processes occur at constant temperature; likewise, isobaric processes occur at constant pressure and isochoric processes occur at constant volume. The equations for the two instabilities are $$\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial T}\right)_{\rho}<0\tag{Isochoric}$$ $$\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial T}\right)_{\rho}-\frac{\rho_0}{T_0}\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\rho}\right)_T<0\tag{Isobaric}$$ In the first, we assume that the cloud is at constant volume, and since the total amount of matter in the system is constant, the (mean) density must also be constant. In the second case, we assume that the cloud is at constant pressure. Perturbations that lead to instabilities thus arise from perturbations of other thermodynamic variables. As a final note on notation, $$\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial A}\right)_B$$ means that we take the partial derivative of $\mathcal{L}$ with respect to $A$ while keeping $B$ constant. It's a common thermodynamical convention. 

Like David Hammen, I'm a bit confused as to whether you think this happened in the Solar System, or just other exoplanetary systems. As far as I know, this sort of formation and migration could not have happened in the Solar System, as per the leading models of its early evolution, because it would have led to a drastically different layout than the one we know today. 

In reality, the two-phase model is an oversimplification, and the ISM has more distinct components. However, the isochoric/isobaric instabilities still limit the range in which clouds can exist in stable equilibria, and explain the dearth of gas in the relevant temperature range. 

As to why indirect evidence for the planet wasn't accumulated earlier - well, objects in the Kuiper Belt and beyond (including the perturbed Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs)) were only first observed in 1992, and we've only built up significant data in recent years. 

This appears to be the geocentric latitude ($\psi$), which is the angle between the equatorial plane and the point on the surface of the ellipse. It can be calculated from the geodetic latitude (also known as the geographic latitude) ($\phi$) and the eccentricity of the ellipse ($e$): $$\psi(\phi)=\tan^{-1}\left(\left(1-e^2\right)\tan\phi\right)$$ If $e=0$, then the two lattitudes are the same, because the focus is at the center of the ellipse. 

The short answer: $\sim10^4$ grams per cubic centimeter. From this webpage, I have a few statistics regarding required mean density and during each phase of fusion (the fusion of lighter elements may happen in the "shells" outside the core). $$\begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline \text{Fusion phase}&\text{Mean density (g/cm}^3)\\ \hline \text{Hydrogen} & 5\\ \hline \text{Helium} & 700\\ \hline \text{Carbon} & 200,000\\ \hline \text{Neon} & 4,000,000\\ \hline \text{Oxygen} & 10,000,000\\ \hline \text{Silicon} & 30,000,000\\ \hline \end{array}$$ This is data for a star of $25M_{\odot}$. Note, however, that this is mean density in the star, not the density in the core, where fusion is taking place. That is on the order of $\sim10^4$ grams per cubic centimeter (see e.g. here). There may be a sharp density dropoff starting from the center of the star, showing that only the hot, dense inner regions can fuse the main element in each stage. 

To see what I'm talking about, look at some examples of directly-imaged exoplanets. Almost all in that list have many times Jupiter's mass and at least its radius. Their semi-major axes are many, many - sometimes thousands - times that of Earth. I can't speculate as to what technology we'll have decades from now, but if you want to find out more about the exoplanets around TRAPPIST-1, direct imaging is not the way to go, and I suspect it will not be a very popular choice among astronomers. 

It's hard to say much about this planet, given that most of its properties are unknown. It hasn't been directly observed; instead, its effects on Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) have been simulated and match observations. That said, its mass can be estimated, which is why it is conjectured to be the core of a giant planet. One of the papers that Batygin & Brown cite is Morbidelli et al. (2012). Morbidelli has done prior work on the evolution of the Solar System if a 5th gas giant formed early in its history, which led to the Jumping Jupiter scenario. This is all described in a modification of the Nice Model. Jumping Jupiter models with the four gas giants lead to one getting ejected from its stable orbit via interactions with the others (see NesvornÃ½ (2011)). This is one of the ice giants - Uranus or Neptune. However, if we postulate the existence of a 5th planet - a third ice giant - then it can be ejected from its orbit, leaving the other four in a stable arrangement. Batygin & Brown are implying that the object perturbing the TNOs may be the core of this 5th gas giant. Since writing the first draft of this answer, I've found out that Batygin has made some estimates that this planet would have been ejected long before the Late Heavy Bombardment - thought to be the result of a Jumping Jupiter scenario - occurred, meaning that it could not be that ejected ice giant, unless we accept a different cause of the LHB. This makes things more interesting, as different initial setups are possible. 

Good answer by Nerrolken. I'll also add that our universe is thought to be infinite in size - which is thought to be a consequence of a flat universe. The data from WMAP seems to indicate very strongly that we live in a flat universe, and that, therefore, in an infinite one. It is impossible to leave an infinite universe, no matter how fast you're going. 

You're correct in that the sharp dropoff is simply because there are very few planned major telescopes operating in the UV range, whereas there are a substantial number planned in the infrared range. As I mentioned in my answer you linked to, CHARA and the EELT, two of the top planned infrared/visible projects, will use new adaptive optics technology, making them far superior to previous telescopes - even though they're ground-based. Obviously, UV telescopes cannot be ground-based, because Earth's atmosphere blocks a substantial amount of UV radiation. Therefore, any substantial improvement in ultraviolet astronomy will require a new space-based mission. The problem is that estimates for even modest increases require much larger mirrors. Proponents of the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) proposals say that an 8-meter telescope, at the least, is needed to get good results at 0.11- to 2.5- $\mu$m wavelengths. That's much larger than HST or JWST - and ATLAST could grow to 16 meters! If ATLAST or a similar project is pursued, the angular resolution at UV wavelengths could be on the order of 0.1 arcseconds or, hopefully, lower. That would match and then beat Hubble. But early estimates put the cost at $4.5 billion for the 8-m version, and Hubble and other space-based telescopes have been famously hurt by unforeseen cost increases. Smaller strides may be needed before we can get to 8 meters, and certainly before we can get anywhere near 16. That's going to take a while, probably a decade or more from now. References 

The answer to your question is both yes and no, depending on the circumstances. Two white dwarfs colliding would likely yield a Type Ia supernova, assuming the combined mass exceeded the Chandrasekhar limit ($\sim1.4$ solar masses). The unstable object resulting from the collision could not be supported by electron degeneracy pressure; when the temperature rises rapidly due to the collision, there is nothing to stop it (compare this to thermal pressure in a "normal" star, which can make the star expand or contract to compensate for changes in temperature). The rise in temperature triggers fusion, which then increases the temperature, which triggers more fusion . . . and so on and so on, in a very short time span. This is the same process, more or less, as in an accretion-powered type Ia supernova. The resulting explosion destroys the object, ejecting matter into space. As with normal Type Ia supernovae, this sort of collision would likely happen in a binary system, with two white dwarfs in close orbits losing energy to gravitational waves and spiraling in (the odds of two unrelated white dwarfs colliding is very, very low). I'm not sure how luminous this event would be in the gravitational wave spectrum; likely fainter than a neutron star-neutron star inspiral but still strong. The speeds of the components could be quite fast, meaning that a lot of energy would be released in the collision. Things are slightly more complicated if the combined mass is less than the Chandrasekhar limit. An example system that is predicted to undergo a collision is SDSS J010657.39-100003.3. The total mass of the two white dwarfs is $\sim0.6$ solar masses, certainly below the limit. In roughly 37 million years (Kilic et al. (2011)), they will collide and form a subdwarf - fusing helium, interestingly enough (compare this to the carbon/oxygen fusion in Type Ia supernova, which in those circumstances is unstable). Similar scenarios could play out in other systems. This sort of a star would not be a "normal" star in the sense that it wouldn't truly be on the main sequence - just a bit below it. It would be an O- or B- type subdwarf, less luminous than main sequence stars of the same spectral type. I saw a couple of articles on these objects claiming that they would be stars just like the Sun - it's not true! Given that white dwarfs are highly depleted in hydrogen - remember, they are the degenerate cores of old stars - there can be virtually no hydrogen burning, even in a shell. Core helium burning is the only option.
