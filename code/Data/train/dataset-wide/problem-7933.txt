Suppose we have a group $G$ which is finitely generated , and let $|\cdot |$ denote some word metric on it. Must there be an element $a\in G$ such that $|a^n|\ge c\cdot n$ for some $c>0$? My intuition says that the answer is "yes", but I wasn't able to find a proof in the general case. There are many cases that I know that the answer is yes - abelian and nilpotent groups, free products, Baumslag-solitar subgroups and many more. What I managed to do - If there is a finite index subgroup $H$ of $G$ such that the abelianization $\frac{H}{[H,H]}$ is infinite, then one can find such an element. The reason that this is true is not so hard - by quasi-isometry, one might as well ask the question for H. Now, we know that $\frac{H}{[H,H]}$ is a finitely generated abelian group (as $H$ is, beacuse $G$ is). Therefore it must have a further quotient which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We let $a\in G$ be some element of $G$ which does not vanish after projecting it to $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and let $v$ be its image there Suppose $|\cdot|$ is a word metric which corresponds to $S \subset G$. Let $T$ be the image of $S$ in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and denote the associated word metric by $|\cdot |'$. Then it's clear that: $$ |a^n| \ge |n\cdot v|' \ge \frac{||n\cdot v||}{\max_{t\in T}{||t||}}=c_{v,T}\cdot n $$ for any norm $||\cdot ||$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. This gives the linear lower bound we wanted. Edit I forgot to mention that $G$ is not the trivial group or a torsion group. Thank you Derek Holt for mentioning it! 

Consider a nonempty finite index set $I$, of cardinal $n$. Consider for $i\in I$ copies $A_i$ of the group with 2 elements, $B_i$ copies of the group of 3 elements. Let $A_i$ act nontrivially on $B_i$ (but trivially on $B_j$ for $j\neq i$). Let $m$ be another integer and consider $$G=G_{m,n}=\left(\prod_i A_i\right)\ltimes \left(\prod_i B_i^m \right)=\prod_i (A_i\ltimes B_i^m)\simeq (C_2\ltimes_{\pm} C_3^m)^n.$$ Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. First assume that $H$ is a 2-group. Then conjugating and enlarging $H$, we can assume that $H$ equals the 2-Sylow $\prod A_i$. Hence the corank of $H$ is equal to the minimal number of generators of $\prod B_i^m$ as a $(\prod A_i)$-module, which is bounded above (actually equal but we don't care) by the minimal number of generators of $C_3^m$ as a $C_2$-module, and this number is clearly $m$ (the $C_2$-action in this case being scalar, it is useless to reduce the generating rank). Let now $H$ be arbitrary. Let $J\subset I$ be the set of $i$ such that the projection $H\to A_i$ is onto, and $K$ its complement. Then looking at the abelianization shows that the corank of $H$ is $\ge \#(K)$. Now assume that $H$ is nilpotent. Denote by $N$ the 3-torsion in $G$, which is a subgroup (the unique 3-Sylow). Then $N\cap H$ is the 3-Sylow in $H$; it is contained in $\prod_{i\in K}B_i^m$ (otherwise its projection on $B_j^m$ is nonzero for some $j\in J$ and having in mind that in $H$, elements of order 2 commute with elements of order 3 as in any nilpotent group, we contradict the fact that the projection of $H$ on $A_j$ is nontrivial since the action of the nontrivial element of $A_j$ on $B_j^m$ fixes only zero). Thus after killing $\prod_{i\in K}A_i\ltimes B_i^m$, we are in the case when $H$ is a 2-subgroup, and we see that the corank of $H$ is at least equal to $m$, provided that $J$ is not empty. If $J$ is empty, then $n=\#(K)$ and hence the corank of $H$ is at least $n$. This proves that the corank of any nilpotent subgroup $H$ of $G_{m,n}$ is at least $\min(m,n)$. 

Absolutely nothing? And now seriously - When I studied the basics of probability theory, and even in more advanced topics (random walks, stochastic processes, etc.), I always felt that the mean and the variance were used extensively (and with good reason). I have wondered what possible uses do higher moments have? 

I think that this operator might not be bounded. Let $e_i$ denote the i-th vector in the standard orthonormal basis form $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})$. Then $$ C\cdot e_i=\alpha_i\sum_{j=1}^i e_j $$ thus $||C||\ge\sup_{n}{(\sqrt{n}\alpha_n)}$. However, the rightmost amount might be infinite even if you assume that $\alpha_n$ are positive and that the sum $\sum \alpha_n$ converges. Indeed, take the sequence defined by $\alpha_n = \frac{1}{log_2(n)^2}$ if $n$ is a power of 2 and $\alpha = 0$ otherwise. The sum $\sum \alpha_n$ becomes $\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2}$, which does converge. However, it's clear that $$ \sup_{n}{(\sqrt{n}\alpha_n)} = \sup_{k} (2^{k/2}*\frac{1}{k^2})=\infty $$ if you want $\alpha_n$ to be strictly positive, then replace $\alpha_n=0$ by $\alpha_n=\frac{1}{2^n}$ (or any rapidly decaying sequence). 

Let $V$ be a vector space. Suppose we are given some upper semi-continuous map $\pi:V\rightarrow \bigcup_{k\le d} Gr(V,d)$, i.e, for any $x\in V$ we specify some subspace $\pi(x) \subseteq V$ of dimension no more than $d$, and these vary in a upper semi-continuous manner. Must there exist a function $\eta$ from $V$ to the grassmannian $Gr(V,d)$ which is continuous/smooth, so that $\eta(x)$ always contains $\pi(x)$ as a subset? 

It sounds to me that you need to detect the tempo of the music, and not the pitch. If you are trying to use a pitch-detection algorithms, then these are going to fluctuate rapidly, as they will lock onto the high frequences in your music. It sounds like you need something that filters out all but the lowest frequencies and allows you to determine how many BPM (beat per minute) the music is, as well as the phase of the beat also, so that you can do beatmatching as you originally mention. However, I don't think that anyone here is going to be able to give you a simple formula for doing this directly from the samples. Digital signal processing is, by its very nature, a fairly mathematical subject. I do think that if you try Googling for "beat-matching signal-processing", or "beat-matching matlab", you will be pointed in the right direction, as you might find a published algorithm for doing exactly what you need. For instance, I found the following paper by searching: Design of an Automatic Beat-Matching Algorithm for Portable Media Devices. It might be worth looking at if you can get it without paying, say through a university with a subscription. Otherwise, I'm sure there are 100's of similar papers you can find on this subject. Also, many universities teach an audio signal processing class, and often the notes from these classes are online. Beat-matching is a common project for students to try in such classes and I'm sure you will be able to find some examples where people have done it. Sorry I couldn't give you more explicit advice, but I hope I understood your question correctly and have pointed you in the right direction. Good luck. 

As I said in a comment, the answer to 1 is trivially no. The answer to 2 (as edited) is also no. Platonov and Tavgen produced a finitely generated, infinitely presented subgroup $H$ in the square $F\times F$ of a free groups such that the inclusion induces an isomorphism of profinite completions (and hence of pro-$p$-completions for all $p$). Here, $F$ can be constructed as follows. Consider any epimorphism $p:F\to P$ from $F$ to an infinite finitely presented group $P$ with no nontrivial finite quotient; then $H$ is defined as the fibre product $\{(g,h)\in F\times F:p(g)=p(h)\}$. That $P$ is finitely presented is used to ensure that $H$ is finitely generated. That $P$ has no nontrivial proper quotient is used by Platonov and Tavgen to prove that the inclusion induces an isomorphism of profinite completions. That the fibre product $H$ is infinitely presented is a classical fact on fiber products. Reference: V. Platonov O.Tavgen. On the Grothendieck problem of profinite completions of groups.

If you are interested in developing quantum algorithms, there is a nice up-to-date survey by Childs and van Dam called Quantum algorithms for algebraic problems, available at $URL$ For PDE's, you might look into hyperbolic polynomials and hyperbolicity cones. The latter are characterized algebraically, there are lots of open questions about them, and their study is also practially relevant to engineering applications like convex optimization (in case practical applications, or perhaps hot funding areas, are what you're looking for). 

Actually, I think the channel is not extremal because I suspect you are misquoting the Landau-Streater result. So I will state it here. To be precise, for anyone unfamiliar with the field, a quantum channel is a trace-preserving, completely-positive linear map on density matrices (positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace), of potentially different sizes. A basic theorem in quantum information says that every quantum channel from $m\times m$-dimensional to $n\times n$-dimensional density matrices can be written in Kraus form: $$ \rho \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \rho A_i^\dagger, \text{ for linear operators } A_k \colon \mathbb{C}^m \to \mathbb{C}^n \text{ satisfying } \sum_k A_k^\dagger A_k = I_m. $$ It is easy to show that the set of quantum channels between systems of fixed dimension is convex. It also easy to show that the set of channels that map $\frac{1}{m} I_m$ to a fixed density matrix $\sigma$ is convex. Now the theorem of Landau-Streater says that if $m = n$, a channel with Kraus form as above is extremal in this latter set if and only if the $N^2$ linear operators $A_i^\dagger A_j \oplus A_j A^\dagger_i$ (of size $2m \times 2m$) are linearly independent. It seems you have instead been working with $m\times m$ matrices. But I think that even if you were to continue and apply the theorem correctly, you would only prove or disprove extremality in the convex subset of unital channels, i.e. those for which $\frac 1m I$ is a fixed point. So potentially you could strengthen Ben-Or's conclusion by showing non-extremality in this subset, or otherwise you might conclude extremality there, which would tell you nothing about extremality in the entire set of channels. 

Actually, instead of all the power of Iwasawa's result, it's enough to prove the result using the weaker result: ($*$) for any connected Lie group $G$ and any increasing sequence $(K_n)$ of compact subgroups of $G$, we have $\overline{\bigcup K_n}$ compact. Possibly this can done by hand (say, without using such things as Levi factors, just more basic Lie theory), I'll think twice. 

Here's an answer for 1: given a LCA group $T$, $\text{Hom}(G,T)$ is LC for every LCA $G$ iff $T$ is a compact Lie group. Proof: Clearly this is a sufficient condition, because it holds for connected tori, and is obviously stable under taking closed subgroup. Conversely suppose the condition is satisfied. Let $\mathbf{Z}^{(\mathbf{N})}$ denote the discrete free abelian group of countable rank. Then $\text{Hom}(\mathbf{Z}^{(\mathbf{N})},T)=T^{\mathbf{N}}$ is locally compact iff $T$ is compact. So $T$ is compact. Let now $D$ be the Pontryagin dual of $T$, so that $D$ is discrete. By the condition and Pontryagin duality, $\text{Hom}(D,G)$ is LC for all LCA $G$. Consider a discrete abelian group $G_0$ (I'll fix it later). For $F\subset D$ finite subset, define $U_F$ as the set of homomorphisms $D\to G_0$ vanishing on $F$. So the $U_F$ form a basis of clopen neighbourhoods of 0 in $\text{Hom}(D,G_0)$. So one of those, say $U_F$ is compact. If $E$ is the subgroup generated by $F$, this shows that $\text{Hom}(D/E,G_0)$ is compact. Now to specify, let us assume from the beginning we picked the group $G_0=H^{(\mathbf{N})}$, where $H=\mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z}$. It is a standard verification that if $D/E$ is nonzero, then $\text{Hom}(D/E,H)$ is not trivial, and an easy consequence is that $\text{Hom}(D/E,G_0)$ is not compact, a contradiction. This shows that $D/E=0$. So $D$ is finitely generated, and thus $T$ is a compact abelian Lie group, as required. A careful look on the proof shows that otherwise, $\text{Hom}(G,T)$ is not locally compact for the specific choice of $G=\hat{\mathbf{Z}}^{\mathbf{N}}\times\mathbf{Z}^{(\mathbf{N})}$, where $\hat{\mathbf{Z}}=\prod_p\mathbf{Z}_p$ and $\mathbf{Z}_p$ are the $p$-adics. Edit: the answer for 2. is, as mentioned in another post, that only the circle satisfies the condition. (I initially thought it was trivially true for the 2-torus (or even the trivial group!), while it's trivially false.) Here's a proof. Taking $G=\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$, the condition implies that $\text{Hom}(\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z},T)$ is nonzero; pick $f$; its kernel is finite and the quotient of $\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$ by the kernel of $f$ is also isomorphic to the circle, so the image is isomorphic to the circle. Now by Pontryagin duality, whenever $\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$ stands as a closed subgroup in a LCA group, it stands as a direct factor. So write $T=H\times \mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$. Then for every $G$ we get $\text{Hom}(\text{Hom}(G,T),T)=G\times \text{Hom}(\hat{G},H)\times \widehat{\text{Hom}(G,H)}\times\text{Hom}(\text{Hom}(G,H),H)$. Since by assumption the identity of $G$ into the first factor is an isomorphism for every $G$, it follows that all other 3 factors are zero. Taking $G=\mathbf{Z}$, we deduce $\widehat{\text{Hom}(\mathbf{Z},H)}=0$, so $H=\text{Hom}(\mathbf{Z},H)=0$ by Pontryagin duality, hence $T=\mathbf{R}/\mathbf{Z}$. 

Is $K(\zeta_n)/K$ an abelian extension for every $n$? What are the roots of unity in the ray class field of $K$ with conductor $\mathfrak{c}$? What are the roots of unity in the ring class field of the order $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{Z} + f\mathcal{O}_K$ with conductor $f$? 

What is $\mathbb{Q}_p \cap \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ ? For instance, we know that $\mathbb{Q}_p$ contains the $p-1$st roots of unity, so we might say that $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta) \subset \mathbb{Q}_p \cap \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, where $\zeta$ is a primitive $p-1$st root. As a more specific example, $x^2 - 6$ has 2 solutions in $\mathbb{Q}_5$, so we could also say that $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6},\sqrt{-1})\subset \mathbb{Q}_p \cap \overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Edit: I removed the motivation for this question (which I think stands by itself), as it will be better as a separate question once I think it through a bit better. 

Yes. Let $K \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a number field that is closed under complex conjugation (not necessarily Galois). Modulo the roots of unity, the group of unitary units in $K$ is free of rank equal to the number of infinite primes of $K$ minus the number of infinite primes of the real subfield $K \cap \mathbb{R}$. Recall that the number of infinite primes of a field is the number of real embeddings + half the number of complex embeddings. This is proved nicely in this paper by Daileda. Note that $K$ and its real subfield have the same number of infinite places iff either $K$ is totally real or $K$ is CM (meaning a totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real field). So for precisely these cases, the only unitary units in $K$ are roots of unity.
