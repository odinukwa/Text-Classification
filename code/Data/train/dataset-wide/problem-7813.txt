Notes on the software The software computes 500 iterates, and then looks at the next 30 iterates. It returns the minimum $n$ such that there are two successive subsequences of length $n$ whose corresponding terms are within $\varepsilon = .001$. If no such $n$ is found, it computes 500 more iterates and tries again. This is repeated 6 times. If no such $n$ is found, the pixel is colored black. Decreasing $\varepsilon$ by a factor of $10^4$ or so takes longer but does not result in a substantially different picture. 

Category theory: There is an isomorphism between a vector space and its double-dual which does not depend on choice of basis. It is natural in the sense that every vector space has such an isomorphism, and these isomorphisms commute with every linear transformation. This should be contrasted between the isomorphisms between a finite-dimensional vector space and its dual. These depend on a choice of basis and are not natural in this sense. This example constitutes the first two paragraphs of the first paper in category theory! Eilenberg-Mac Lane: General theory of natural equivalences. In Categories for the working mathematician, Mac Lane writes that the purpose of discussing categories is to discuss functors, and that the purpose of discussing functors is to discuss natural transformations. 

My take on this question: it's not the operator, it's the solutions. More explicitly, the solutions of $\Delta u=0$ enjoy the fundamental property that $u$ at a point is the average of the values of $u$ at surrounding points. You will agree that this property is very physical, and sounds reasonable for many quantities which tend to diffuse: heat, tension, energy, etc. And not only physics, also pure math: minimal surfaces, discrete variants which have to do with averaging processes, and so on. Basically, every time there is a quantity which diffuses at a fast time scale, so you may speak of an 'equilibrium', you see that this averaging property pops out (or something similar). Now, the average condition is nonlocal, and the way to express it as a local (differential) equation is precisely by saying that $\Delta u=0$. Add this to all the already mentioned properties (symmetry, positivity, being the nicest possible Fourier multiplier, etc etc) and you will be slightly less surprised. 

In particular, one can see the behavior along the positive real axis matches the description above. (Although there are no axes in this picture, I have verified separately that the transition point in the picture is correct.) Unfortunately, I have no idea how to explain the rest of the picture! Although I have been careful writing the software, I can't say with certainty that the picture is correct anywhere other than the positive real axis. This question is in danger of being too general, so here is one specific question to answer: Is the cardoid-shaped region colored 1 correct? I would, of course, also be happy to hear any other verifications of features in this picture, or other behavior of $P(z)$ not depicted. 

Probably the sharpest result on this is due to Tataru, he proved sharp Garding for $C^2$ symbols (and even Fefferman-Phong for $C^4$ symbols). The paper is available here. 

Take a look at Lemma 3.3 in this paper, which we wrote exactly for the purpose of proving a limiting absorption principle in the operator norm between weighted spaces; it is sufficient to have some weak convergence to get the stronger result. Maybe this can be applied also in your concrete situation. 

Any convex (or concave) function on a convex set is locally Lipschitz, thus in particular a function $f$ which is convex or concave on an interval is absolutely continuous. Now if you construct a function which is continuous on $[a,b]$ but not absolutely continuous on any subinterval, this should fit the bill. 

Sin and exp At the risk of going on too long, I think it's natural to also address a similar question for the sine and exponential functions. Here is the picture for exp: 

Motivation Two of my colleagues were discussing the behavior of cos along the positive real axis on our department mailing list. I was curious about the complex behavior, but this is outside my field, so started making pictures like the ones shown here. I've been thinking about these off and on for a little over a year, but not really made any progress or had anyone give me a useful reference. So I wanted to see what the wider MO community has to say. If you want some higher-resolution pictures for cos, see this G+ post: $URL$ 

If $v$ is a temperate distribution such that $\Delta v=0$ then the Fourier transform of $v$ must be supported at 0 hence it is a finite combination of derivatives of the Dirac delta, which in the end means that $v$ is a polynomial. Thus if I'm not mistaken the condition $u\in L^p$ for some finite $p$ should guarantee uniqueness. 

If $g(t,x)$ is bounded smooth and say $g(t,x)\le-1$ on a strip $0\le t\le T$, then one could solve the problem backwards starting from $t=T$ with rough data. By general properties of parabolic equations the solution becomes smooth for $t<T$. Reversing time in the usual direction, you have constructed smooth data at $t=0$ and a solution which becomes rough at $t=T$. This answers in a rather weak sense your question; I guess you are interested in stronger forms of ill-posedness. Probably playing with the previous idea (e.g., repeating at a sequence of times $T_n\to0$ and summing the resulting solutions) it should be possible to produce reasonable data for which no local smooth solution exists, but one should check the details. 

Are there standard or known weights/metrics on cyclic orders? Cyclic orderings are different ways of listing elements from a finite set, where you call two lists the same if they differ only by a rotation. For example, the ways that 4 people can sit at a circular table, where you ignore rotation of the table. So the following 4 rankings of a 4-item set should be considered the same: 

Do strictly symmetric monoidal topologically-enriched categories model all connective spectra? If your modeling functor is some reasonable variant of the ordinary classifying space functor, I think the answer must be No. What I know for sure about this question is written (with AngÃ©lica Osorno) in this paper: Modeling stable one-types. In that paper we study how to model the Postnikov data of spectra with just two nonzero homotopy groups (in dimension 0 and 1). The Postnikov data in such a low-dimensional case consists only of the two (abelian) homotopy groups $\pi_0$ and $\pi_1$, together with a Postnikov invariant. Therefore we restrict not only to symmetric monoidal categories, but to those symmetric monoidal categories where all morphisms are invertible and all objects are invertible up to isomorphism. (The standard term for these is "Picard categories", but a more descriptive name would be "grouplike symmetric monoidal groupoids".) The sloganized summary of the paper is that the symmetry of the Picard category is the data which corresponds to the Postnikov invariant of the stable 1-type. (There's a neat connection with the theory of quadratic maps, and some calculations of Eilenberg and Mac Lane from the 1950's, which partially explain why you might expect this.) I'll skip the precise details here -- you can try the paper, or just ask me later. For a specific example, we write down a symmetric monoidal category which models the Postnikov truncation of the zeroth space of the sphere spectrum. It has a strictly associative and unital monoidal structure, but the symmetry is nontrivial. 

Let me try again (I deleted an earlier wrong post). First of all, a sufficient condition for subadditivity on $x>0$ is: $f(x)/x$ nonincreasing. This is easier to work with since it is a local condition. The proof is elementary (take $x\ge y>0$, then $f(x+y)\le f(x)(x+y)/x=f(x)+yf(x)/x\le f(x)+f(y)$). For smooth $f$ this is equivalent to $f'\le f/x$. Thus it is sufficient to look for a non concave function $f(x)$ which is smooth on $(0,\infty)$, has right limit zero at zero, and satisfies on $x>0$ the inequalities $$ 0\le f'(x) \le \frac f x.$$ Now, take $f=x^a$ with $ 0 < a < 1 $; we may start with any example, but just to fix the ideas. This is a concave function satisfying all the requirements of the problem. Notice that actually there exists $d>0$ such that $$ d\le f'(x) \le f'(x)+d \le \frac f x \text{ on } (0,1].$$ Any function satisfying this condition is a good starting point. We shall modify $f$ on a compact subset of $(0,1)$ so to make it non concave near a point. Let us take a smooth non negative cutoff $g \in C^2_c(0,1)$ such that $|g'|\le 1$ and define $f_t=f+tg$, for $t$ a small positive constant. We have $f'_t=f'+tg'$, so if we restrict $t$ to $ 0 < t < d $ we have $$ 0 \le f_t'\le \frac {f_t} x $$ everywhere. It is clear that $f_t$ for all $ 0 < t < d $ satisfies all the requirements of the problem. Can we choose $g$ so to make $f_t''(1/2)>0$? We have $$ f''_t(x_0)=f''(x_0)+t g''(x_0) $$ so in conclusion we are looking for a smooth function supported in a compact subset of $(0,1)$, non negative, such that $$ |g'|\le1 \text{ and } g''(1/2)\ge N $$ for a fixed $N$ arbitrarily large. This obviously exists, e.g. take a piecewise linear function and approximate it with test functions. 

Now, maybe there's some other way of modeling connective spectra with strictly symmetric monoidal but topologically enriched categories. But I think our work proves it can't be done in a way that generalizes the ordinary classifying space functor when the enrichment is discrete. 

You can think of this as arranging the 4 items on a circular list, with no particular top, but a definite direction. I would like to compare different cyclic orderings in a meaningful way. I have learned that there are many well-known ways of assigning distance or weight to non-cyclic orderings (a.k.a. permutations!). For example: 

The question has been exhaustively answered, I'd like to add a remark. The way I view the Lebesgue integral is: to every positive measurable function you can associate a meaningful integral (i.e. stable by all natural operations and limit procedures), which might be infinite. Now if you have a sign-changing measurable function, you can assign an integral to its positive and its negative part. If one of the two is finite, then you can associate a meaningful integral to that function too. If both are infinite, there are ways to define an integral in some cases, but much less meaningful and stable; some natural operations become impossible to define or unstable in general. I find this a quite natural approach: in most theorems you can replace the assumption 'integrable' with 'whose integral is defined'. Also, it is pretty intuitive that if both areas above and below the $x$-axis are infinite, there is little point in defining the signed area of the whole region. Consider for instance the Fubini theorem (for $L^1$ functions) and its counterpart for positive functions, which we call the Tonelli theorem here in Italy. You can actually merge the two results and just say: if the integral of a measurable $f(x,y)$ is defined, then both iterated integrals are defined and give the same result as the double integral. 

A first simple idea is the following: given a permutation $a$, count the number of $i$ such that $a(i+1) \neq a(i) +1$, where $0 \leq i \leq n$ and index addition is performed modulo $n$. A natural variation on this idea would sum $|a(i+1) - (a(i)+1)|$. I haven't thought about either of these too carefully yet. Do they appear in the literature somewhere? Some nontrivial internet searching hasn't turned anything up. 

This last one, for the sine function, is even more bewildering to me. There is something that looks very much like a Mandelbrot set there. Why?
