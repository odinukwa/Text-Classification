I am adding the following remark because it may be of some interest to the number theorists who recognized the Bernoulli numbers to know that the relationship with Lie theory explained in the question has number-theoretic substance: namely, in his article on the thrice-punctured sphere, Deligne uses the Lie algebra point of view on Bernoulli numbers described in the question (together with other ingredients, of course, and applied to a specific Lie algebra) to derive Euler's formula for the values of $\zeta(2n)$. 

The map from $\mathbb C^{n^2}$ to the space of monic polynomials of degree $n$ which associates to a matrix $M$ its char. polynomial is the best kind of map you could imagine (algebraic, surjective, open, ... ). If a set in its source has positive measure, than so does its image. Now the set of polynomials with repeated roots is the zero locus of a non-trivial polynomial (the discriminant), and so has measure zero. Thus so does its preimage. In short, the space of matrices in ${\mathbb C}$ whose eigenvalues are distinct has full measure (i.e. its complement has measure zero). Any such matrix is diagonalizable (its Jordan Normal Form is a diagonalization). 

I believe that Arthur Ogus has been working on a book on this topic for many years. I don't know if it (or at least some version of it) has appeared. (I looked on his web-page and found what looks like a nice set of slides from a talk, 62 pages of them, but no actual book.) In any event, Ogus certainly has many papers on the topic. My recommendation, if you have gotten through Kato's article, would be to start reading some of Ogus's and others' articles. A lot of them are reasonably foundational, and should be accessible if you have Kato's article under your belt. In addition to the names already mentioned in the various comments and answers, Kisin has a couple of nice papers using log-schemes on his web-page. One nice application, arithmetic in nature (and the first place that I saw log schemes), is the paper of Coleman--Voloch on companion forms. Kisin's paper on the Galois action on the prime-to-p-etale fundamental group is another nice application to arithmetic geometry that I know of. 

In the setting of the question, the composite $f\circ g$ is idempotent. Thus one hypothesis on $\mathcal C$ that will guarantee the existence of the desired splittings is that $\mathcal C$ be Karoubian, or (same concept, alternative name) pseudo-abelian, which is to say: $\mathcal C$ is pre-additive (the Hom-sets are abelian groups) and all idempotents have kernels (and hence cokernels). 

If $n$ is prime to $p$, then ${\mathbb Q}\_p(a^{1/n})$ is unramified if $n | v_p(a)$, and is tamely ramified otherwise. To see this, we note that we may first of all divide $a$ by powers of $p^n$, and so assume that $0 \leq v_p(a) < n.$ If in fact $v_p(a)=0$, i.e. $a$ is a unit, then the extension is unramified, and the ring of integers is equal to ${\mathbb Z}\_p[a^{1/n}]$ (by Hensel's lemma, since $x^n - a$ is then a separable equation mod $p$). Otherwise, if $0 < v_p(a) < n,$ we get a tamely ramified extension (essentially by the definition of tamely ramified). If $p | n$ then the situation is a little more complicated. For example, if $n = p$ and $0 < v_p(a) < p,$ then the extension is wildy ramified. If $a$ is a unit, then we may write $a = \zeta u,$ where $\zeta$ is a $(p-1)$st root of 1 and $u \equiv 1 \bmod p,$ and since $\zeta^p = \zeta,$ we see that ${\mathbb Q}\_p(a^{1/p}) = {\mathbb Q}\_p(u^{1/p}).$ Now (supposing that $p$ is odd, for simplicity) if $u \equiv 1 \bmod p^2,$ then $u$ is in fact a $p$th power in ${\mathbb Q}\_p,$ and so the extension is trivial. On the other hand, if $u \equiv 1 \bmod p,$ but not mod $p^2$, then the extension is wildy ramified of degree $p$, with ring of integers equal to ${\mathbb Z}\_p[u^{1/p}].$ To see this last claim, note that if $X^p - u = 0,$ and we write $Y = X - 1$, then $(Y + 1)^p - u = 0,$ i.e. $Y^p + pY^{p-1} + \cdots + p Y + (u-1) = 0,$ and so $Y$ satisfies an Eisenstein polynomial of degree $p$. This implies that the extension is wildly ramified of degree $p$, that $Y$ is a uniformizer in the extension, and that the ring of integers is equal to ${\mathbb Z}\_p[Y] = {\mathbb Z}\_p[u^{1/p}].$ Added in response to Keith Conrad's comments below: As Keith points out, the extension ${\mathbb Q}_p(a^{1/n})$ is not really well-defined unless ${\mathbb Q}_p$ contains the $n$th roots of $1$, or equivalently, if $n$ divides $p-1$ (or 2 if $p = 2$). But note e.g. if $p$ does not divide $n$, then adding the $n$th roots of unity gives an unramified extension of ${\mathbb Q}_p(a^{1/n})$, and so the ramification behaviour is independent of the choice of $n$th root, while in the case when $n = p$ also treated above, adjoining the $p$th roots of unity is a tamely ramified extension of ${\mathbb Q}_p$, so the claims regarding wild ramification are independent of the choice of $p$th root. 

This follows from the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorf formula. Serre's lecture notes on Lie algebras and Lie groups should cover it. 

Some comments, too extensive to fit into the comment box: (1) There is a fairly recent reworking of at least some parts of the proof in the book "Heegner points and Rankin $L$-series", MSRI Publ. 49. (Brian Conrad in particular has a paper in there reworking the deformation theory arguments.) (2) The theorem is a computation: one computes the height of the Heegner point, using Neron-Tate local heights, and relates the answer (a sum of contributions from each place) to a corresponding expression for the derivative. (3) It is Kolyvagin's work which shows that if the Heegner point is non-zero, then it generates the Mordell-Weil group (up to finite index); so if you want motivation for the truth of Gross--Zagier, you can think of it as being a consequence of BSD + Kolyvagin. (This may be ahistorical, though.) (4) Historically, Birch was the one who computed Heegner points on elliptic curves, and found that they were generators of the Mordell--Weil group (up to finite index) precisely when the rank was one. This was a big source of encouragement for Gross (as he explained at one point when I was in grad school), because it meant that there should be a relation between the derivative at 1 and the height of the Heegner point, and one just had to find it. (5) The arithmetico-geometric parts of Gross--Zagier are wonderful; I wouldn't at all think of it as futile to study them. I've not studied the analytic parts, but no doubt they're equally wonderful. (6) You might start with the Crelle paper of Gross--Zagier, which essentially treats the case of level one. Since the modular curve of level one has genus 0, the height is necessarily zero, and so one gets a very nice formula relating the sum of the finite local heights to the archimedean local height. And one can prove the same formula another way, using a special case of the analytic arguments that in the general setting compute the derivative. The fact that the same formula is obtained these two different ways is a special case of the general Gross--Zagier formula; but it may be simpler to understand the two sides and the comparison between them in this level one setting. (7) As far as I understand, Kato says nothing in the analytic rank one case. For BSD in this case, one needs Gross--Zagier plus Kolyvagin. 

Weil's proofs for curves and abelian varieties essentially use special cases of the standard conjectures, and the framework of the standard conjectures (like many other conjectures of a motivic nature) is suggested by trying to generalize the abelian variety case (or if you like, the case of H^1) to general varieties (or if you like, to cohomology in higher degrees). Deligne's proof for K3 surfaces uses a motivic relation between K3s and abelian varieties (which is most easily seen on the level of Hodge structures) to import the result for abelian varieties into the context of K3 surfaces. This is not so different in spirit to Manin's proof for unirational 3-folds, except that the relationship between the K3 and associated abelian variety (the so-called Kuga-Satake variety) is not quite as transparent. [Added, in light of the comments by Donu Arapura and Tony Scholl below:] In the K3 example, it would be better to write "a conjectural motivic relation ... (which can be observed rigorously on the level of Hodge structures) ...". 

If you have a space, you can consider the category of sheaves of sets on the space; the latter is a topos (the archetypal example thereof). Since sheaves are (a) very flexible; and (b) highly attuned to the topology of the underlying space, the topos remembers a lot of information about the space. Thus, forgetting the space but remembering the topos, while being perhaps a radical change in perspective, is not really abandoning the idea of the space, but is exactly just changing ones perspective on what a space is. Thus, passing to the study of topoi from the study of spaces is just one more step in a (very) long mathematical tradition of studying the nature of shape and space. (Somewhat more bluntly, one might argue that every question about a space that one wants to study is encapsulated in some way sheaf-theoretically, and so remembering the topos precisely remembers everything interesting about the space; hence one is metamorphising the concept of space in such a way as to remember precisly what is interesting, and eliminate from consideration everything that is extraneous.) 

As I alluded to in a comment to one of your previous questions, many people have thought about how to explicitly compute fundamental domains, homology, etc., for congruence subgroups of $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$: this leads to the theory of modular symbols, which is not only a theory, but serves as the foundation for all computational work on modular forms too. (See papers of Mazur and Manin from the 1970s, and for the computational aspects, more recent writings of Cremona, William Stein, and others.) On a related note, let me remark that it it actually quite feasible, and reasonable, to generate a fundamental domain for a finite index subgroup by translating the fundamental domain for $SL_2(\mathbb Z)$. For a carefully worked example, see here (especially the discussion on page 6). 

I would try SGA2. Often these questions are treated by a consideration of the local cohomology exact sequence (or excision, if you prefer), which has the form $\cdots \to H^i_Z(X,\mathcal O) \to H^i(X,\mathcal O) \to H^i(U, \mathcal O) \to H^{i+1}_Z(X,\mathcal O) \to \cdots,$ where $H^{\bullet}_Z$ denotes local cohomology with support in $Z$. Vanishing results for local cohomology then give vanishing results for cohomology on opens, and SGA2 is devoted to the study of such vanishing results. 

I'm not sure about the suggested equivalence in the last two sentences of your question, but at least the statement about etale group schemes has a negative answer. That is, it is possible to have an etale group scheme $G \rightarrow S$, with $G$ and $S$ both finite type over a field $k$, but $G$ not finite over $S$. For example, let $H$ be the constant group scheme ${\mathbb Z}/2{\mathbb Z}$ over $S$, let $s$ be some fixed closed point of $S$, and let $G := H \setminus 1_s,$ where $1_s$ is the non-zero element of the fibre $({\mathbb Z}/2{\mathbb Z})_s$. Then $G$ is open in $H$, hence etale over $S$. Assuming that $S$ is positive dimensional, it is certainly not finite (we deleted one point of one fibre), and it is a subgroup scheme of $H$. (If $T$ is an $S$-scheme, then $G(T)$ is the subgroup of $H(T)$ consisting of points whose values at points of $T$ lying over $s$ are trivial.) 

Kisin's work is fairly technical, and is devoted to studying deformations of Galois representations which arise by taking $\overline{K}$-valued points of a finite flat group over $\mathcal O_K$ (where $K$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$). The subtlety of this concept is that when $K$ is ramified over $\mathbb Q_p$ (more precisely, when $e \geq p-1$, where $e$ is the ramification degree of $K$ over $\mathbb Q_p$), there can be more than one finite flat group scheme modelling a given Galois represenation. E.g. if $p = 2$ and $K = {\mathbb Q}\_2$ (so that $e = 1 = 2 - 1$), the trivial character with values in the finite field $\mathbb F_2$ has two finite flat models over $\mathbb Z_2$; the constant etale group scheme $\mathbb Z/2 \mathbb Z$, and the group scheme $\mu_2$ of 2nd roots of unity. In general, as $e$ increases, there are more and more possible models. Kisin's work shows that they are in fact classified by a certain moduli space (the "moduli of finite flat group schemes" of the title). He is able to get some control over these moduli spaces, and hence prove new modularity lifting theorems; in particular, with this (and several other fantastic ideas) he is able to extend the Taylor--Wiles modularity lifting theorem to the context of arbitrary ramification at $p$, provided one restricts to a finite flat deformation problem. This result plays a key role in the proof of Serre's conjecture by Khare, Wintenberger, and Kisin. The detailed geometry of the moduli spaces is controlled by some Grassmanian--type structures that are very similar to ones arising in the study of local models of Shimura varieties. However, there is not an immediately direct connection between the two situations. EDIT: It might be worth remarking that, in the study of modularity of elliptic curves, the fact that the modular forms classifying elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q$ are themselves functions on the moduli space of elliptic curves is something of a coincidence. One can already see this from the fact that lots of the other objects over $\mathbb Q$ that are not elliptic curves are also classified by modular forms, e.g. any abelian variety of $GL_2$-type. When one studies more general instances of the Langlands correspondence, it becomes increasingly clear that these two roles of elliptic curves (providing the moduli space, and then being classified by modular forms which are functions on the moduli space) are independent of one another. Of course, historically, it helped a lot that the same theory that was developed to study the Diophantine properties of elliptic curves was also available to study the Diophantine properties of the moduli spaces (which again turn out to be curves, though typically not elliptic curves) and their Jacobians (which are abelian varieties, and so can be studied by suitable generalizations of many of the tools developed in the study of elliptic curves). But this is a historical relationship between the two roles that elliptic curves play, not a mathematical one. 

The $L$-functions of motives have (conjecturally) the same analytic properties as do the $L$-functions of automorhpic representations. Converse theorems suggest that these $L$-functions are then necessarily automorphic $L$-functions. 

Dear Akhil, I am not an expert in simplicial methods by any means, but I thought it might help to give an answer at a much lower level than the other answers and comments. What will come just reflects my own (somewhat meager!) attempts to understand some simplicial constructions. My point here will not primarily be to explain why simplicial constructions beat cubical or other constructions, but just to give some examples of how you can use them and what they mean. (Also, this answer is not very "high concept"; rather it is very very low concept! But hopefully it might still be useful.) Firstly, you can think of a simplicial set as just a big bag of simplices with instrutions on how to glue them: you have a set of points, a set of intervals, a set of $2$-simplices, etc., and the boundary maps tell you how to glue. If you actually glue them according to the boundary maps, you get a space. So at first blush it is reasonable to think of simplicial sets as just a technical improvement on the pretty simple idea of simplicial complexes. Since reasonable spaces (from the point of view of algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, or smooth manifolds) can be triangulated, it is then not so surprising that one can capture a lot about topological spaces in this way. Now let's suppose you have something a little more sophisticated instead, like a simplicial scheme: now you have a scheme of points, a scheme of 1-simplices, etc. You can think of the scheme of points as just the basic scheme underlying the simplicial scheme; call it $X_0$. Now the scheme $X_1$ of $1$-simplices has boundary maps to the scheme of points. So you can think of $X_1$ as a kind of correspondence on $X_0$. For simplicity, imagine that the two boundary maps into $X_0$ are closed embeddings, so that you have two copies of $X_1$ sitting inside $X_0$. The fact that this is the scheme of $1$-simplices tells you that you are supposd to join all matching points in the two copies of $X_1$ by 1-simplices, and that you should think of these 1-simplices as varying continuously along the two copies of $X_1$. Now you glue in a family of 2-simplices indexed by $X_2$ in the same way, etc. How do these arise: well a good example (taken from Deligne's Hodge III paper) is given by considering the resolution of singularities $\tilde{X}$ of a singular projective variety $X$. You can make the simplicial scheme $X_n:= \tilde{X}\times_X \cdots \times_X \tilde{X}$ ($n+1$ copies) with boundary maps given by projections and degeneracies given by partial diagonals. (Side note: This construction does show one advantage of simplicial constructions over various alternatives, namely, you can produce simplicial objects simply by taking iterated products; this provides a very convenient bridge between practice and theory, which might well be harder in other --- say cubical --- models.) In particular $X_0$ is just $\tilde{X}$, so this simplicial scheme is $\tilde{X}$ with a bunch of simplices attached. If you think about how they are attached, you'll see that the $1$-simplices join all the points that lie in a single fibre under the projection $\tilde{X} \to X$. And then every triangle made up of $1$-simplices bounds a $2$-simplex, and so on. So this simplicial scheme is a model for $X$ in which the parameterizing schemes are smooth (edit: as Bhargav notes in a comment below, to actually get smooth schemes beyond $X_0$, one typically has to do more, but let me suppress this here), but one has glued in $1$-simplices explaining how points should be identified in order to get back down to $\tilde{X}$ (and the higher simplices are added just to ensure that no extra topological strucure is being created by the $1$-simplices you have glued in). This indicates that working simplicially, one has flexibility in making certian constructions, e.g. rather than forming a quotient directly (like actually passing from $\tilde{X}$ to $X$), we can instead form the quotient by gluing in paths between the points that are to be identified (and then adding higher order simplices as needed to kill of the loops, etc., that are accidentally introduced in the process of adding these paths). Of course, one can then go further to make constructions that would not actually be possible in the non-simplicial world. E.g. suppose that you want to define relative etale cohomlogy $H^i(X,Y; \mathbb Q_{\ell})$, for a closed subscheme $Y$ of $X$. Topologically, this is the same as the (reduced) cohomology of the space obtained from $X$ by collapsing $Y$ to a point. You can't usually do this in the world of schemes, but you can do it simplicially, using some variant of the construction described above. So, to get an answer to the question "why does "simplicial" make everything work so well?", I would suggest that you not only think about the formalism (model categories and so on), but also that you play around with various constructions of the type I've described, and related ones (e.g. the constructions of $BG$ and $EG$ for an algebraic group as simplicial schemes), and try to picture them physically as schemes with simplices being glued in. Try to think of other constructions from topology and see if you can figure out how you would make them in the world of schemes using simplicial schemes. Of course, your explicit constructions will match with the general formalism, but they should also help to illuminate it, and to provide intuition.
