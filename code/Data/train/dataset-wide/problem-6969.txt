There is a broad literature that attempts to address the very question you pose- what is the impact of immigration (legal and illegal) on native wages? However, if you're interested in the 'real world' evidence, I'd suggest focusing on empirical labor economics as opposed to more theoretical labor models. The reason for my suggestion is that theoretical economics makes no clear prediction without a lot more information. There are a variety of factors, such as the production function being considered, the labor market conditions observed, the relative substitutability of immigrant and native workers, etc. which tends to make answering the question more of an empirical exercise. As far as the findings of the empirical papers, they actually tend to find relatively little impact of immigrant labor on native wages, with a few notable exceptions. For some examples: This survey paper, though a bit out of date as it's from 2005 outlines the results of 18 papers and finds wide discrepancies depending on modeling techniques and underlying assumptions used. Borjas, 2003 is one of the better known works, and finds what one might expect based on Econ101 models- that an increase in immigrant labor supply leads to a decrease in wages for native workers. A couple very well known articles have tried to tease out the impact of immigration on wages by focusing on particular events (called supply shocks) where the number of immigrants increased "suddenly" for reasons having nothing to do with the economic climate at the time. A pair of papers examined the impact of the Mariel Boatlift, which led to a spike in Cuban immigrants in Miami: The first, a paper by Card 1990 found no evidence of a negative impact of immigration on wages, while Borjas 2015 finds a substantial decrease in the wages for the least educated Miami residents. Several other papers have found either no negative effect, or even positive effects, of immigrants on various worker wages. For example, this paper by Peri in 2011 finds no negative impact of immigrants on wages, but a strongly positive impact of immigrants on productivity. This paper from 2013 finds significant positive impacts of undocumented immigrants on the wages of native workers in Georgia. Ultimately, the exercise of determining the impact of immigrants on wages really depends on the method of analysis and a number of underlying parameters, and applying "standard" (i.e. Principles of Micro) models can lead to erroneous results and a false sense of certainty. If there's anything else in particular you're interested in, let me know and I'll try to improve the answer! EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to include a link to this additional survey paper in the original answer! 

People use the Hausman test to decide between fixed/random effects models, but I find the intuition and justification of the choice of the proper model more appropriate. I am unaware for a specific test which includes Fama-MacBeth but I am far from an expert in the field. 

2. In Fama and MacBeth regression can individuals under study be different in different time periods? Yes, and this is one of the reasons that Fama-MacBeth is appealing, since you can run it on unbalanced panel datasets. In a balanced panel, every individual has data for the same/every time period, while in an unbalanced this is not a requirement. 1. In panel data application, when using Fama and MacBeth regression is preferable over the fixed or random effect model? Is there a statistical test shedding light on this issue? Usually, in finance, a fixed effect concerns a firm effect (dummy for firms), while Fama-MacBeth is designed to account for a time effect (Petersen (2008)). Random effects are rarely used in the financial literature (Petersen (2008)). As he says: "When the residuals of a panel regression are correlated, not only OLS standard error estimates are biased but also the coefficient estimates are inefficient (the estimates do not exploit all of the information in the data). Researchers can improve efficiency by estimating a random effects model using a GLS approach." To sum up: 

I realize this question might be too old to reply to, but it was just bumped to the homepage. But anyway: I think other answers might be missing the forest for the trees a bit. Most basic economic models could be defined with either "stocks" or "flows" as you've defined them. Ultimately, it's about measuring productivity in a generalized production function. You can define the inputs however you'd like- labor could be defined in "full time employee equivalents," or "hours worked," or a vareity of other things. Capital, as many other answers have noted, is incredibly hard to pin down in some cases. That said, it can often be defined and measured through depreciation, investment, "hours of machine X used," "number of tractors used," etc.. More generally, both are pinned down by their relative factor income shares: an early estimation of which led to the creation of the Cobb-Douglas Production Function, which is an instructive example. For that, you define labor as the number of person hours worked (so if you worked for two companies, four hours each, it would count as 8 total "units" of labor), and capital as the total value of all machinery, buildings, equipment, etc.. You then look at how productive resources are allocated between the two, and back out income shares. For this, you never needed to really touch the "stock vs flow" issue, you just had to make sure your definitions were consistent. 

You have $$ \begin{align}Â u(\lambda a + (1 - \lambda) b, \lambda b + (1 - \lambda)a) &= \sqrt{\lambda a + (1 - \lambda)b} + \sqrt{\lambda b + (1 - \lambda)a} \\ &\geq \lambda\sqrt{a} + (1 - \lambda)\sqrt{b} + \lambda\sqrt{b} + (1 - \lambda)\sqrt{a} \\ &= \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \\ &= u(a, b) \end{align}$$ The inequality in the second line follows from Jensen's inequality for concave functions. I don't think you need to prove Jensen but you can even do that moderately easy with the AM-GM inequality if you want to. 

Currently I am trying to figure out some old problems for an upcoming micro exam. One of them is about production under uncertainty. The exercise seems standard to me, yet I am not sure whether I have the correct solution. The question is as follows. A firm produces goods with the cost function $C(x) = cx^2$ where $x$ is the good. The price $p_x$ is exogenously given. The utility function of the producer is given as $u(y) = \sqrt{y}$ where $y$ is the income due to profit. Determine the optimal amount of produced goods $x$ in case i.) $p_x$ is deterministic and (ii.) the price is random where it is $p^0_x$ with probability 0.5 and $p^1_x$ with probability 0.5. How will the output change if there is some future price $p^f_x > \mathbb{E}[p^s_x]$? My solution is as follows. First, we have that the firm's profit is $$G = p_xx - cx^2$$ and its utility $$ u(y) = \sqrt{p_xx - cx^2}$$ Now under deterministic prices the firm owner wants to maximize expected utility, hence $$\frac{d\mathbb{E}[U]}{dx} = (p_xx - cx^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(p_x - 2xc) = 0$$ and therefore $$x = \frac{p_x}{2c}$$ In case of random prices the optimality condition is now $$ \frac{d\mathbb{E}[u]}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}((p^0_xx - cx^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(p^0_x - 2xc) + (p^1_xx - cx^2)^{-\frac{1}{2}}(p^1_x - 2xc) = 0$$ right? After that I have to solve for $x$ and I got the result. Finally, if there is some future price which is higher than the expected price I am not quite sure how to proceed. Intuitively, I'd say that if the owner would produce more goods but how would I show that in an analytic manner? 

There are likely two major (and closely related) reasons for this: First- stock prices aren't purely reflective of what a company is worth today, instead, stock prices reflect the expected future prices as well. Events like this, which increase uncertainty and instability, might change expectations about future stock prices. This is then incorporated into current stock prices, which leads to a fall. Second- a lot of automated trading algorithms incorporate news keywords into their pricing structures (for example), which can lead to reactions based on the headlines themselves. These can then create a feedback loop with other funds, like ETFs, which trade based on volatility indexes. I'm sure there are other reasons as well, (perhaps the breakdown in the summit led some traders to reevaluate the relative bargaining power of the US and China in their upcoming summit, which in their mind might lead to an increased likelihood of a trade war, as a hypothetical), though those two can explain many large fluctuations! 

I am again running into problems with regard to expected utility and utility of expectation. This is very similar to this question I posted a few days ago. Since it did not clear the matter then I post this as a separate question as it is placed, I think, in a more general setting. This time I don't care about income but about prices. The question is as follows. Let $C(x) = cx^2$ be the cost function for some $c \in \mathbb{R}$. The output price is $p_s$ and variable according to the scenario $s$. The utility of the firm is given as $u(\Pi_s) = \log(\Pi_s)$ where $\Pi_s$ is the profit in scenario $s$. Now there are two scenarios. In the first, the price is $p_1 = \bar{p} + z$ with probability $w$ and $z \in \mathbb{R}$ constant and in the second, $p_2 = \bar{p} - z$ with probability $(1 - w)$. Derive the optimal output $x$ if the agent has to decide for the quantity before the price is known. In my opinion, there are two ways to solve this. Either I set up the first-order condition separately, i.e. $$\frac{d\mathbb{E}[u]}{dx} = w \frac{(\bar{p} + z) - 2cx}{(\bar{p} + z)x - cx^2} + (1 - w)\frac{(\bar{p} - z) - 2cx}{(\bar{p} - z)x - cx^2} = 0$$ which is quite cumbersome to solve for $x$ afterwards or I compute the expected price $p^* = \mathbb{E}[p] = z(2w - 1) + \bar{p}$ and then solve $$\frac{d\mathbb{E}[u]}{dx} = \frac{p^* - 2cx}{p^*x - cx^2} = 0$$ for which $x$ would then just be $$x = \frac{p^*}{2c}$$ What I don't understand is which approach should I use here and, in particular, why? I am familiar with vNM-rationality and the expected utility maximization context but I cannot see which one beats the other and what is the theoretical argument there: expected utility of possible prices or utility of expected prices? 

From a quick glance, it looks like the difference is that the new finance minister is including promised payments that the government had previously made, but hasn't had to pay yet. For example, say I borrow \$10 from you. At the same time, say I had previously promised (in an unrelated interaction) to give you \$5 at the start of June. What's my current debt to you? Officially, it's \$10 (from the loan you had given me). But come the first of June, if I haven't paid you back yet, I'll find myself in debt to you for \$15: \$10 from the loan, and the additional \$5 from the promise. Effectively, the new finance minister is counting the debt to be the entire \$15 (that is, current debt obligations, as well as promised future payments to different projects in Malaysia), while the official figure only considers my debt to be \$10 (since I don't yet technically owe you the additional \$5). Technically, the government official figures are correct, since the government can "get out" of the future payments by (I'd assume) changing the law to remove themselves from that responsibility. At the same time, since (it looks like) those payments are to Malaysian government/private company partnership projects, simply refusing to pay would ultimately undermine Malaysian projects, which would hurt citizens. Which is more important depends on the context, and the interests of the individual. 

I am yet a bit confused about the actual application of the Efficient Component Pricing Rule (or Baumol-Willig pricing rule) for a network monopolist $M$. What I know is the following. The ECPR determines the optimal access price $a$ which $M$ charges some downstream competitor for accessing its network. More precisely, it says that the access price is the direct (marginal) cost plus the opportunity cost of the monopolist $M$ which is also equal to the retail price minus the saved (marginal) cost of the incumbent for not serving the costumer at the downstream market himself. On the other hand, in my notes, there is stated that the access price should optimally be equal to the marginal cost for the operation of the network. And this is where I am confused as I don't know which would really be the 'efficient' one? Let's consider a simple example. Let's say there's some network monopolist $M$ that can also serve consumers at the downstream market with a product that is priced $p = 10\$$. The marginal cost for serving the consumers is $c^* = 2\$$ per unit. The cost for maining the network, i.e. for operation and such, is $ C = 5\$$. What would now be the optimal price that the monopolist charges a downstream competitor which would like to access $M$'s network in order to serve the consumer, having a marginal cost for selling at the markt of $c > 0$? According to what I first understood it should be $a = p - c^* = 10\$ - 2\$ = 5\$ + [10\$ - 2\$ - 5\$] = C + [p - c^* - C]$. But according to my notes, it should just be $a = C = 5\$$. What is correct and why? 

I cannot precisely answer your questions because I do not know which exactly regressions you want to perform as @jmbejara says and which papers are you referring to that use Fama-MacBeth regression. Are they on financial or other literatures? I haven't seen Fama-MacBeth on other literatures (I do not follow any other literature to be exact), so please post the papers. Obviously, if in other literatures one can justify the analogy of the risk-premia concept, Fama-MacBeth can be applied there, too. I answer your three main questions in reverse. 3. It would be very kind of you, if you guide me through a link or book dealing whit this subject? If you are interested for financial panel data, there are plenty of resources to consult. Some are: 

Why shouldn't we date many partners in the first place? (so you have two types: monogamic and polygamic --- there are scientific hints that human's are polygamic). That the other partner regards the other's "unconditional interest" as truthful (it can't be truthful to begin with). That they think that making commitments is indeed incentivizing (which is also related to 1). 

In class we dealt with insurance economics and, specifically, adverse selection due to information asymmetry. As one possible solution we considered pooling contracts, i.e. the same contract for both high- and low-risk households for some average price. We showed and I understood why the high-risk households now would buy more insurance than the low-risk ones and thus everybody would act as if they were low-risk whether this is true or not. What I am not sure about is why there wouldn't be an equilibrium in a competitive market. It's clear that the low-risk individuals have reason to go for a lesser premium and, if some other insurer would offer this, then they would go there. Therefore, my questions are: 1) So why won't there be an equilibrium? I would think that if a new insurer appears with a better deal than the pooling contract, then there would again be the problem with adverse selection. Hence, the new insurer wouldn't appear and offer a better deal in the first place? 2) I also read that this is pareto-inefficient in that it disadvantages the low-risk households (obvious) but does not benefit the high-risk households. The latter point I do not understand since the high-risk households will have a higher demand since the pooling contract situation makes the insurance relatively cheap. Isn't that a benefit?
