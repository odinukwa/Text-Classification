For simplicity, let's say that the black hole is isolated and non-rotating (and uncharged), so that the situation is described by the comparatively simple Schwarzschild spacetime. Let's also suppose that the camera free-falls radially into the black hole. What is the camera looking at? Suppose it is looking at some stationary object that does something with a known frequency. Your question is basically how at what frequency it will be observed on the video feed emitted by the camera. Without loss of generality, we can suppose that the camera is looking at us, and that we're shining a laser beam at it: the 'doing something at a known frequency' would be the oscillations in the electromagnetic wave of the laser beam. We can do this because time dilation affects every physical process, so we might as well pick one that is more convenient to think about. At this point, it is straightforward why the camera feed will not show any time dilation: being equivalent to a reflected laser beam, the gravitational blueshift when going inward will be cancelled by the gravitational redshift going outward.

How much time dilation happens depends entirely on what coordinates we're talking about (more generally, which frame field). What a given observer will actually see, however, is completely independent of choice of coordinates. In particular, Penrose diagrams illustrate the light cone structure of the given spacetime, and what an observer can in principle see depends entirely on what light rays intersect the observer's wordline. So yes, it's taken into account by default. If you're actually falling in it, no, your understanding is mistaken, for reasons explained above. For additional motivation, flip the question around: what does the very distant stationary observer see of the infalling object? On the above Penrose diagram, outwardly directed light rays are diagonal, from lower-left to upper-right. Draw some some outward light rays from the blue infalling worldline. You will see that no matter how far into the far future (up on the diagram) you pick an event outside the black hole to be, you can connect that event with an outward light ray originating from the blue infalling worldline before it crosses the horizon. The conclusion would be that an observer that stays outside the black hole would be able to see the infalling object arbitrarily far into the future. No matter how much time passes for someone who stays out of the black hole, the image of the infalling object would still be visible as it was before it crossed the horizon. (In principle at least; in practice it will get too faint to see after a while.) Thus, the usual result of "infinite gravitational time dilation makes the image of the infalling object hover forever near the horizon" is also straightforwardly deducible from the diagram, and so is completely consistent with the infalling object being able to see a finite part into the future of the external universe. Perhaps it is best to emphasize that the situation is not actually symmetric: what the external observer sees of the infalling object is not some straightforward flip-around of what the infalling object sees of the external universe. The black hole itself breaks that symmetry. 

Orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime can be described by the effective potential $$V_\text{eff} = -\frac{GM}{r} + \frac{\mathfrak{l}^2}{2r^2} - \frac{GM\mathfrak{l}^2}{c^2r^3}\text{,}$$ where $\mathfrak{l} = r^2\dot{\phi}$ is the specific angular momentum of the orbit, which is a conserved quantity. The first two terms match the form of the Newtonian effective potential, except that here we're referring to the Schwarzschild radial coordinate $r$ and proper time of the orbiting particle, instead of radial distance and coordinate time. The first term being the usual gravitational potential and the second being the centrifugal potential, so Goldstein's $V$ does make some sense as a gravitational potential energy term instead. Therefore, $l^2 = mka(1-e^2)$ with $k = GMm$ means that $l$ is the angular momentum, $l = m\mathfrak{l}$, and $$\frac{GM\mathfrak{l}^2}{c^2r^3}m = GMm\frac{l^2}{m^2}\frac{1}{c^2r^3} = \underbrace{\frac{kl^2}{m^2c^3}}_b\frac{1}{r^3}\text{,}$$ just as Goldstein says. If we differentiate $\frac{1}{2}m\dot{r}^2 + mV_\text{eff} = \mathcal{E}$ with respect to proper time, then $$\begin{eqnarray*}m\ddot{r} - \frac{l^2}{mr^3} &=& -\frac{k}{r^2} - \frac{3b}{r^4}\\ &=& -\frac{k}{r^2}\left(1 + 3\frac{l^2}{m^2c^2}\frac{1}{r^2}\right)\\ &=& -\frac{k}{r^2}\left(1 + 3\frac{m(GMm)a(1-e^2)}{m^2c^2}\frac{1}{r^2}\right)\\ &=& -\frac{k}{r^2}\left(1 + 3\frac{v_c^2}{c^2}\frac{a(1-e^2)}{r}\right)\text{.} \end{eqnarray*}$$ This is dimensionally correct, as both $v_c/c$ and $a/r$ are dimensionless, while $$\frac{l^2}{mr^3} = \frac{k}{r^2}\frac{a(1-e^2)}{r}\text{.}$$ The left-hand side has the Newtonian form. 

Since the Sun's gravity is among its influences, it would instantly stop having an effect on us. That's just part of the magical situation, and doesn't even involve any physics. A bit more interesting is the question without the bolded part. In general relativity, changes in the gravitational field propagate at the speed of light. Thus, one might expect that the magical and instant disappearance of the Sun would not affect earth for about eight minutes, since that's how long light from the Sun takes to reach Earth. However, this is mistaken because the instant disappearance of the Sun itself violates general relativity, as the Einstein field equation enforces a kind of local conservation law on the stress-energy tensor analogous to the non-divergence of the magnetic field in the electromagnetism: in any small neighborhood of spacetime, there are no local sources or sinks of stress-energy; it must come from somewhere and go somewhere. Since the magical instant disappearance of the Sun violates general relativity, it does not make sense to use that theory to predict what happens in such a situation. Thus, the Sun's gravity instantly ceasing any effect on the Earth is just as consistent with general relativity as having any sort of time-delay. Or to be precise, it's no more inconsistent. 

A white hole is simply the time-reversed version of a black hole. For any physical situation, its time-reversal is, formally speaking, possible. It does not mean that it is possible in any physically reasonable sense of the term. If you release a macroscopic amount of gas in the corner of a large vacuum container, it will spread throughout. There is a physical state that's the exact time-reverse of this, with a gas spread through spontaneously arranging itself in a corner. Yet it does not happen. It's so overwhelmingly unlikely that one can say it is impossible. The reason it doesn't happen is the second law of thermodynamics. Because of the connection between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics demonstrated by Hawking radiation and similar insights, white holes are are as impossible as cracked eggs spontaneously re-assembling themselves. Or rather, more impossible, because black holes are the most entropic objects in the universe, and so require a much larger violation of the second law. 

Note that for cosmic expansion, special relativity only applies when the spacetime region in question is approximately flat, which in our case happens when it is small. 

One can immediately see that Walter's equation is the above second-order equation, just in normal units rather than $G = c = 1$. I don't know what Walter's argument is (I'm willing to bet the approximation is because Walter substituted a circular-orbit case for $L^2$ or $h^2$ somewhere, though), but that particular relationship holds exactly for massive test particles in Schwarzschild spacetime. It does not even have to be a bound orbit, although of course if one is interested in precession specifically, it would have to be at least bound for precession to make sense. Lightlike geodesics are described by nearly the same equation, just without the $M/h^2$ term. Furthermore, we can also restate it as $$u'' + u = \frac{M}{h^2}\left[1 + 3\frac{h^2}{r^2}\right] \leadsto \frac{\mu}{h^2}\left[1+3\frac{h^2}{r^2c^2}\right]\text{,}$$ which after substitution of $V_t\equiv r\dot{\phi} = h/r$ is what you have. Conclusion 

This is just the front coefficient in the above: if $T$ is the orbital period of Mercury, then $$6\pi\frac{GM/c^2}{a(1-e^2)}\frac{1}{T} = \frac{42.98''}{\mathrm{century}}\text{,}$$ and we can restate the GTR prediction of Mercury as $$\dot\varpi_{\text{☿}}^{\scriptsize\text{GTR}} = \left.\frac{42.98''}{\mathrm{century}}\right.\left[1+2958J_2\right]\text{,}$$ where $J_2$ is the gravitational quadrupole moment of the Sun. 

In very a general post-Newtonian metric for a two-body system with the first body oblate, where $M\equiv m_1+m_2$ is the total mass, $\mu\equiv m_1m_2/M$ is the reduced mass, and $p\equiv a(1-e^2)$ is the semi-latus rectum of the orbit, the perihelion advance per orbit is $$\small\delta\varpi = 6\pi\frac{GM}{pc^2}\left[\underbrace{\frac{2-\beta+2\gamma}{3}}_{\text{GTR}=1} + \underbrace{\frac{2\alpha_1-\alpha_2+\alpha_3+2\zeta_2}{6}}_{\text{GTR}=0}\frac{\mu}{M} + \frac{J_2R^2c^2}{2GMp}\right]\text{.}$$ According to GTR, $\beta=\gamma=1$ exactly. The second term contains various parameters relating to preferred-frame effects and energy-momentum non-conservation. In GTR, they are all identically zero, while experimentally, $\alpha_1\lesssim10^{-4}$ and the rest are many orders of magnitude less than that. Finally, in the third term, $J_2$ is the quadrupole moment of the first body; $J_2R^2 = (C-A)/m_1$ where $C$ and $A$ are moments of inertia about rotational and equatorial axes, respectively. A derivation can be found Will §7.3. 

That was phrased too poorly, so let me clarify. If you're watching a far-away supernova, the collapse and explode process will take a different amount of time in the supernova's own local rest frame than is seen by you. Taken alone, it's up to you whether you interpret this fact as time dilation of your clock relative to the supernova or a stretching of wavelengths due to cosmic expansion, or any combination of both. However, what we have decided is to use a frame in which the homogeneity and isotropy of the universe is directly manifest, in which case we're not "looking" at a single supernova but all around us. For a general FRW spacetime, we cannot re-interpret cosmological redshift as due entirely to time dilation without spoiling those conditions. The reason is that homogeneity and isotropy picks out a sequence of spatial hypersurfaces, i.e. a sequence of "nows", snapshots of the universe at instants of time. Then generally the distances between different galaxies are different at different times. 

As before, there is a confusing avoidance of specifying the unit under consideration, but the pattern is still that the last number is in minutes of arc, the middle in degrees, and the first in $30^\circ$ for the Zodiac divisions, so: $$\begin{eqnarray*} \frac{(1780+80)\times 3}{808} &=& 6+\frac{27}{30} + \frac{10}{30\times 60} + \frac{41}{30\times 60^2}+\ldots \\ &=& (6;\;27\!:\,10)\text{.}\end{eqnarray*}$$ The $+2$ makes this $(6;\;27\!:\,12)$, although this makes the second addend in minutes of arc while the first one is not. As before, the calculation is not rounded.
