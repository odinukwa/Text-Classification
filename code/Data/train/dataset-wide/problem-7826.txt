In dimension 4, the Todd genus does not depend on the choice of a symplectic structure or even on an almost complex structure. If $M$ is an almost complex 4-manifold, then $\langle c_1(M)^2, [M]\rangle = 2\chi(M) + 3\sigma(M)$ (see here, p. 9), and $\langle c_2(M), [M]\rangle = \chi(M)$; here $\chi(M)$ is the Euler characteristic of $M$ and $\sigma(M)$ is its signature. Thus any orientation-preserving diffeomorphism preserves the Todd genus, and the orientation-preserving assumption is necessary, because the signature depends on the choice of orientation. This is also mentioned at the end of §2 of this paper by Łukasz Bąk. 

This is one of those calculations which is easier with the general formalism of homology, rather than just Betti numbers. Using the Mayer-Vietoris theorem a few times, one can show that if $M$ and $N$ are connected $n$-manifolds and $k\ne n-1,n$, then $$H_k(M\mathbin{\#}N)\cong H_k(M)\oplus H_k(N).$$ (For a proof and explanation, see this Math.Stackexchange answer.) Hence, when $n > 1$, $$H_2(\mathbb{CP}^n\mathbin\#\mathbb{CP}^n)\cong H_2(\mathbb{CP}^n)\oplus H_2(\mathbb{CP}^n)\cong \mathbb Z\oplus\mathbb Z,$$ so its Betti number is $$b_2(\mathbb{CP}^n\mathbin\#\mathbb{CP}^n) = \dim H_2(\mathbb{CP}^n\mathbin\#\mathbb{CP}^n) = 2.$$ (When $n = 1$, $\mathbb{CP}^1\cong S^2$, so $\mathbb{CP}^1\mathbin\#\mathbb{CP}^1\cong S^2\mathbin\# S^2\cong S^2$, and $b_2(S^2) = 1$, so to get $b_2 = 2$ one must assume $n > 1$.) 

To support J.C. Ottem's answer, let me present one example. Let $R = \mathbb{C}[x,y]$ and $I = (x,y^2)R$. What is the minimal graded free resolution of $R/I$, equivalently $I$? That is, $0 \rightarrow R(-3) \stackrel{d_1}{\rightarrow} R(-1) \oplus R(-2) \stackrel{d_0}\rightarrow R \rightarrow R/I \rightarrow 0 $ where $d_1 = (-y^2 \;\; x)$ and $d_0 = (x \;\; y^2)$. Now, ask what are the graded Betti numbers and minimal number of generators for $R/I$. I agree with J.C. Ottem's opinion on reviewing the definitions. I hope this helps. 

I don't think the conlusion right above Question 1 is correct. Let $S = k[x,y,z]$ and $I = (z^2,zy,zx^3-y^4)$. Then by the Hilbert-Burch theorem a graded minimal free resolution of $I$ is given by the following presentation matrix $$ \begin{pmatrix} y & -x^3 \\ z & y^3 \\ 0 & z. \end{pmatrix} $$ By analyzing the matrix you can see that the shifts are $-2,-2,-4$ and $-3, -5$. In particular $b^2_1 = 3$ and $b^1_3 = 4$. 

I believe the book Arithematic of blowup algebras by Vasconcelos has good information and references of ideals of linear type. Also, there are other cases one can say a bit more about the defining equations of Rees algebras under additional assumptions. 

Suppose I have (roughly speaking) a multivalued meromorphic function $f(z)$ on all of $\mathbb{C}$ that is single-valued and holomorphic on the open unit disc and has some branch points of finite order (but no poles) on the unit circle. Does the Taylor series always converge uniformly to $f(z)$ on the closed unit disc? This seems very likely but I do not think I have ever seen a proof. I know an argument that works for the simplest possible case, namely the function $f(z)=\sqrt{1-z}$. 

Given such a map $f:\Delta_n\to\Delta_n$, put $f_t(x)=(1-t)x+t f(x)$. This gives a homotopy between $f$ and the identity, and each map $f_t$ also sends every subsimplex to itself. In particular, each $f_t$ preserves $\partial(\Delta_n)$ and so induces a self-map $\overline{f}_t$ of the space $\Delta_n/\partial(\Delta_n)\simeq S^n$. It follows that $\overline{f}$ is homotopic to the identity, and so is not homotopic to a constant map. This means that $\overline{f}$ must be surjective (because any non-surjective map factors through a space $S^n\setminus\{a\}$, which is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ and so contractible). As $\Delta_n\setminus\partial(\Delta_n)$ is dense in $\Delta_n$, it follows that $f$ itself is also surjective. 

In algebraic topology one key point is as follows. The complex $K$-theory spectrum has homotopy groups $KU_{\ast}=\mathbb{Z}[u,u^{-1}]$, with $u$ in degree two. This ring maps in an obvious way to $\pi_{\ast}(H\wedge KU)$, and it is not hard to calculate that the resulting map $\mathbb{Z}[u,u^{-1}]\to\pi_{\ast}(H\wedge KU)$ induces an isomorphism $\mathbb{Q}[u,u^{-1}]\to\pi_{\ast}(H\wedge KU)$. The ring $(H\wedge KU)^0(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$ can be described as $\mathbb{Q}[[ux]]$ or as $\mathbb{Q}[[y]]$, where $x$ comes from $H^2(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$ and $y$ comes from $KU^0(\mathbb{C}P^\infty)$. Specifically, if we let $L$ denote the tautological line bundle, then $y$ can be taken to be the $K$-theory class of the virtual bundle $L-1$. It then works out that $y=e^x-1$, so $x/y$ is the Bernoulli series. The Bernoulli numbers occur as coefficients of $x^k/k!$ rather than $x^k$ itself, which suggests that one should work with $\Omega S^3$ rather then $\mathbb{C}P^\infty$: there is a canonical map $\Omega S^3\to\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ using which we can identify $H^*(\Omega S^3)$ with the ring of all series of the form $\sum_ka_kx^k/k!$ with $a_k\in\mathbb{Z}$. All this is of course linked with Adams's treatment of the $J$-homomorphism and the $e$-invariant. However, I think that much of this is still mysterious, at least to me. I think there are some missing ingredients involving the relationship between $R$ and $gl_1(R)$ for various $E_\infty$ ring spectra $R$, particularly those related to surgery and the $J$-homomorphism. There is a lot of literature about this kind of thing from the 1970s but I have not managed to extract the answers that I wanted. 

Consider the following exact sequence $$ 0 \to L \to G(M) \to G(M/xM) \to 0 $$ where $L$ is the kernel of the map $G(M) \to G(M/xM)$. It is easy to see that $x^* G(M) \subseteq L$. Hence we have $$ 0 \to L / x^* G(M) \to G(M)/ x^* G(M) \to G(M/xM) \to 0 $$ exact. By the hypothesis the dimension of $G(M)/ x^* G(M)$ is at most $d-1$. This implies that $\dim G(M/xM)$ is at most $d-1$. Since $\dim G(M/xM) = \dim M/xM$, you can conclude $\dim M/xM = d-1$. Since $x$ avoids all the minimal primes ideal of $M$ and $M$ unmixed, $x$ is a non zerodivisor of $M$. I don't think I used the assumption of $G(M)$ being equidimensional. 

Hello. I believe that the endmorphism ring may not be hard to compute in this case. Let $R = k[x,y]$ where $k$ is a field, and let $I = (x^2, xy^n, y^{n-1})$. Then $End_R(R/I) = Hom_R(R/I,R/I) \cong Hom_{R/I} (R/I,R/I) \cong R/I$. But $R/I$ is a local ring since $\sqrt{I} = (x,y)$ which is a maximal ideal in $R$. You may also want to take a look at Section 2 of $URL$ by Yi Zhang. It discusses indecomposibility of a module in terms of a presentation matrix of the module. 

Given a spherical fusion category $\mathcal C$, the Levin-Wen model constructs a lattice field theory: to each oriented surface with a triangulation, it assigns a state space $\mathcal H$ and a Hamiltonian $H$, whose space of ground states is independent of the choice of triangulation; and the Turaev-Viro model uses $\mathcal C$ to construct a (2+1)-dimensional oriented TQFT $Z_{\mathcal C}$. Kirrilov (2011) showed that for any spherical fusion category $\mathcal C$ and oriented surface $\Sigma$, the space of ground states of the Levin-Wen model for $\mathcal C$ on $\Sigma$ is canonically isomorphic to the state space $Z_{\mathcal C}(\Sigma)$ in the Turaev-Viro TQFT. Is there an analogous result in one dimension lower? Presumably this construction would, given a semisimple commutative Frobenius algebra $A$, define a lattice model on the circle whose space of ground states can be canonically identified with $A$. Someone's probably worked on this, but I haven't found any references. 

The manifold $P(m,n) := (S^m\times \mathbb{CP}^n)/(\mathbb Z/2)$, where $\mathbb Z/2$ acts by the antipodal map on $S^m$ and by complex conjugation on $\mathbb{CP}^n$, is called a Dold manifold. In "Erzeugende der Thomschen Algebra $\mathfrak N$", Dold computes the mod 2 cohomology, Steenrod module structure, and Stiefel-Whitney classes of $P(m,n)$. The calculations are fairly straightforward, and I found them to be a good example when I was learning Stiefel-Whitney classes and wanted more examples than projective spaces. The paper is in German, but it's nonetheless quite readable, especially with a dictionary. 

The function $g_e(x)=1-x^{(1-e)/2}$ is strictly decreasing on $[0,1]$ with $g_e(0)=1$ and $g_e(1)=0$, so there is a unique fixed point $h(e)$, and this is what we want to find. Put $x_0=h(0)=(3-\sqrt{5})/2$. Experiment makes it clear that $$ g_e(x_0) \leq g_e^3(x_0) \leq g_e^5(x_0) \leq \dotsb \leq h(e) \leq \dotsb \leq g_e^6(x_0) \leq g_e^4(x_0) \leq g_e^2(x_0) $$ for all $e$, and that $g_e^k(x_0)\to h(e)$ as $k\to\infty$. The above inequalities might or might not give bounds of the type that you need. 

We can expand the answer from user83633, following hints in the notes by Edmonds, as follows. Let $G$ be a finite group acting faithfully on an $n$-dimensional torus $T$ and fixing a point $p$. We can write $T$ as $V/L$ for some vector space $V$ and lattice $L<V$. As $T$ is homogeneous, we can assume that this identifies $p$ with the zero element. Let $\pi\colon V\to T$ be the obvious projection, which is a universal covering. Covering theory tells us that there is a unique way to let $G$ act on $V$ such that $0$ is fixed and $\pi$ is equivariant. This action preserves $\pi^{-1}\{0\}=L$, and we can identify $L$ with $H_1(T)$ equivariantly. We want to show that the action of $G$ on $L$ is faithful. If not, we can choose a subgroup $C\leq G$ of prime order $p$ that acts trivially on $L$. We will show that this leads to a contradiction. First note that the free action map $L\times V\to V$ is $G$-equivariant, and $C$ acts trivially on $L$, so we get an induced free action of $L$ on $V^C$. The map $\pi$ gives an injection $V^C/L\to T^C$; we claim that this is a homeomorphism. As everything is compact and hausdorff, we need only check that it is surjective. Suppose that $x\in T^C$, and choose $v\in V$ with $\pi(v)=x$. If $g$ is a generator of $C$, we must then have $g.v=a+v$ for some $a\in L$. As $g$ acts trivially on $L$ this gives $g^k.v=ka+v$ for all $k$, so in particular $v=g^p.v=pa+v$ so $pa=0$ so $a=0$ so $g.v=v$ as required. For the rest of the argument we will use various cohomology groups; these are always taken with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}/p$. Next, recall that $H^*(BC)$ is the tensor product of a polynomial algebra on a class $x$ of degree $2$ with an exterior algebra on a class $a$ of degree $1$. For any $C$-space $X$ we have a map $EC\times_CX\to EC/C=BC$, which makes the Borel cohomology group $H_C^*(X)=H^*(EC\times_CX)$ into an algebra over $H^*(BC)$. We write $\widehat{H}^*_C(X)$ for the ring obtained by inverting $x$ in $H_C^*(X)$. If $Y$ is a $C$-subspace of $X$ then we have relative groups $\widehat{H}_C^*(X,Y)$ defined in a similar way. If $C$ acts freely on $X\setminus Y$ then these relative groups are trivial, as one can prove by cellular induction starting from the case where $X=C\times B^d$ and $Y=C\times S^{d-1}$. On the other hand, if $C$ acts trivially on $X$ then $\widehat{H}^*_C(X)=H^*(X)\otimes R^*$, where $$R^*=\widehat{H}^*_C(\text{point})=\mathbb{Z}/p[x,x^{-1}]\otimes E[a].$$ Because $C$ has prime order, it must act freely on $X\setminus X^C$, so $\widehat{H}^*_C(X,X^C)=0$, so $$ \widehat{H}^*_C(X) \simeq \widehat{H}^*_C(X^C) \simeq H^*(X^C)\otimes R^*. $$ This is essentially what is called Smith theory. Now take $X$ to be our vector space $V$, so $V$ is contractible, and the usual spectral sequence $H^*(G;H^*(X))\Longrightarrow H^*_G(X)$ gives $H^*_G(V)=H^*(BG)$ and therefore $\widehat{H}^*_G(V)=R^*$. By comparison with Smith theory, we get $H^*(V^C)=\mathbb{Z}/p$. As $L$ acts freely on $V^C$ with $V^C/L=T^C$ we get a spectral sequence $$ H^*(L;H^*(V^C)) \Longrightarrow H^*(T^C) $$ This admits a map from the similar spectral sequence $$ H^*(L;H^*(V)) \Longrightarrow H^*(T). $$ As $H^*(V^C)=H^*(V)=\mathbb{Z}/p$, the map is an isomorphism on the initial page, and there is no room for any differentials anyway, so the map $H^*(T)\to H^*(T^C)$ is an isomorphism. In particular, the map $H^n(T)\to H^n(T^C)$ is an isomorphism. On the other hand, if $X$ is any proper subset of $T$ then the restriction $H^n(T)\to H^n(X)$ factors through the group $H^n(T\setminus \{x\})=0$ for some $x\in T$. Thus, we must have $T^C=T$, which means that $C$ acts trivially on $T$. This contradicts our assumption that the action of $G$ is faithful. 

There's an interesting application of stable homotopy theory to condensed-matter physics, and it makes heavy use of integral and torsion information, contradicting your 4th assumption. Within the general program of understanding topological phases of matter, condensed-matter theorists are interested in symmetry-protected topological phases (SPT phases). Approximately speaking, these are systems which have interesting topological behavior in the presence of a symmetry, but become trivial when that symmetry is broken. Their classification has gradually gotten more homotopical: 

René Thom proved that two closed $n$-manifolds $M$ and $N$ are (unoriented) cobordant iff their Stiefel-Whitney numbers agree: for any partition $i_1 + \dotsb + i_k = n$, $$[M]\frown w_{i-1}(M)w_{i_2}(M)\dotsm w_{i_k}(M) = [N]\frown w_{i-1}(N)w_{i_2}(N)\dotsm w_{i_k}(N).$$ The mod 2 Euler characteristic is a Stiefel-Whitney number: $\chi(M)\bmod 2 = [M]\frown w_n(M)$. Thus, if $M$ and $N$ are unoriented cobordant, then their Euler characteristics differ by a multiple of 2. (There might be a more direct proof of this using handles.) You can get rid of the mod 2 assumption if you work with (stably almost) complex cobordism, equipping all manifolds and cobordisms with a complex structure on the stable normal bundle. (In particular, this determines an orientation of your manifold.) Milnor and Novikov showed that $M$ and $N$ are complex cobordant iff their Chern numbers agree: these are defined in the same way as Stiefel-Whitney numbers, but for Chern classes. The Euler characteristic is a Chern number: $\chi(M) = [M]\frown c_n(M)$ if $M$ is $2n$-dimensional, and $\chi(M) = [M]\frown 0$ if $M$ is odd-dimensional. Thus in any dimension, the Euler characteristic is a cobordism invariant for stably almost complex cobordism. 

Consider a polynomial $f(z)=c\prod_m(z-\lambda_m)\in\mathbb{C}[z]$. I am mostly interested in the case where this actually lies in $\mathbb{R}[z]$, but that is not essential. I wanted to find a nice formula for a smooth function on $\mathbb{R}$, depending continuously on the coefficients of $f(z)$, which approximates a sum of $\delta$ functions concentrated at the real roots of $f$. A natural choice is $$ \phi_\epsilon(f)(t) = \sum_m\exp(-\pi|t-\lambda_m|^2/\epsilon^2). $$ I found that $$ \sum_m\exp(-\pi|\lambda_m|^2) = \iint_{\mathbb{C}}k(|z|)\log|f(z)|\,|dz|^2, $$ where $$ k(r) = 4(\pi r^2-1)e^{-\pi r^2} = -2r^{-1}\frac{d}{dr}(r^2 e^{-\pi r^2}). $$ The more general formula $$ \phi_\epsilon(f)(t) = \epsilon^{-2}\iint_{\mathbb{C}} k(|z-t|/\epsilon)\log|f(z)|\,|dz|^2 $$ can easily be deduced from this. I have a proof of all this, by a longish chain of fairly standard manipulations, but it is probably more complicated than necessary. I suspect that this identity must be known, but I don't believe I have ever seen it before. Can anyone point me to a reference? 

I think that the simplest nontrivial case comes from the maps $$ S^5 \xrightarrow{\Sigma^2\eta} S^4 \xrightarrow{2\iota} S^4 \xrightarrow{\Sigma\eta} S^3 $$ Both two-stage composites are trivial, so we get a Toda bracket which is a subset of $[S^6,S^3]$. This group (or at least the $2$-primary part) is cyclic of order 4, generated by an element called $\nu'$. One way to describe $\nu'$ is to note that $S^3$ can be identified with the group $SU(2)$, so we have a commutator map $S^3\times S^3\to S^3$. This sends $S^3\times 1$ and $1\times S^3$ to the basepoint, so it induces a map from $S^6=S^3\wedge S^3$ to $S^3$; this is $\pm\nu'$. Alternatively, using $SO(3)=S^3/\{\pm 1\}$ we see that $\pi_3(SO(3))=\mathbb{Z}$, and we can apply the unstable $J$-homomorphism to a generator to get a map $S^6\to S^3$, which is again $\pm\nu'$. Toda showed that the above Toda bracket is $\{\nu',-\nu'\}$ (so the indeterminacy is $\{0,2\nu'\}$). If you are happy to work stably, then the relevant group is $\pi_3(S)=\mathbb{Z}/8.\nu$, where $\nu$ is the quaternionic Hopf map, and $\nu'$ becomes $2\nu$, so $\langle\eta,2,\eta\rangle=\{2\nu,-2\nu\}$. However, if you want to build intuition then then you may well be better off thinking about Massey products; these are closely analogous to Toda brackets, but you can write down examples by pure algebra. 

Therefore, choose say $I = (x+y, y^2)$. This is integrally closed: The length of the module $R/I$ is two and $I \subseteq (x,y)R$. If it were not integrally closed, then the maximal ideal $m = (x,y)R$ is its integral closure. Then $Im^q = m^{q+1}$ for $q \gg 0$. However, the LHS does not contain $x^{q+1}$. Since $I$ is a complete intersection, it is its own minimal reduction. Therefore, $$ \overline{I^{n+1}} = I^{n+1} = I I^n = I \overline{I^n}, $$ where the first and last equalities follow from the result of Zariski. 

I don't think the corollary is true without further assumptions. Take $R = k[x,y,z]$ and $I = (x(y-1), y,z(y-1)$. Since $x(y-1), y,z(y-1)$ is a regular sequence, hence depth $(I,R)$ = 3. But $x(y-1),z(y-1), y$ is not a regular sequence. I believe that the statement is that $I$ can be generated by an $M$-sequence. If $M = R$, then it is Exercise 16.9 in the same section in Matsumura's book. 

I guess this follows from how to compute $I^n$. Since $I = J + K, \; I^n = J^n + J^{n-1}K + \cdots + K^n = J(J^{n-1} + \cdots + K^{n-1}) + K^n = JI^{n-1} + K^n$. 

I believe that you meant to say that the Bass number with respect to the maximal ideal is $0$ if $i \neq d$ and 1 if $i = d$. This is a consequence of the Gorensteiness of the ring $R$. I am pretty sure Matsumura's commutaive ring thoery book contains this result. In fact the vanishing part comes from the Cohen-Macauayness of the ring $R$. And $\dim_{R/m} Ext^d_R (R/m, R) = 1$ makes the ring of (Cohen-Macaulay) type $1$. This also is well known, a local ring having a canonical module is Gorenstein if and only if it is a Cohen-Macaulay ring of type $1$. 

By various standard lemmas, a CW complex $X$ is contractible if and only if every map $u:S^{n-1}\to X$ (for any $n>0$) can be extended over $B^n$. In this context $u(S^{n-1})$ is compact and therefore (by another standard lemma) contained in some subcomplex with only finitely many cells. If $X$ is the union of some totally ordered family of subcomplexes $X_\alpha$, it follows that $u(S^{n-1})\subseteq X_\alpha$ for some $\alpha$. This is enough to prove what you want. 

These are called Wilson spaces, because they were first studied in Steve Wilson's paper "The $\Omega$-spectrum for Brown-Peterson homology II". He showed that 

The natural description is like this. There are augmentations $\epsilon_X:H^*(X)\to\mathbb{Z}$ (for $X\in\{M,N\}$) and orientation classes $u_X\in H^d(X)$. Put $$R'=\{(a,b)\in H^*(M)\times H^*(N):\epsilon_M(a)=\epsilon_N(b)\} = H^*(M\vee N)$$ and $R=R'/(u_M,-u_N)$. Then one can use the cofibration $$ S^{d-1} \to M \# N \to M\vee N $$ to identify $H^*(M\#N)$ canonically with $R$. Thus, if $i+j=d$ with $i,j>0$ then the product of $H^i(M)$ with $H^j(N)$ in $H^d(M\# N)$ is zero, but the product of $H^i(M)$ with $H^j(M)$ is the same as in the original manifold $M$. 

Fix a prime $p\geq 5$ and an integer $n>0$. All spaces in this question are implicitly $p$-localized. Consider the spaces $X=J_{p^n-1}S^2$ (the $p^n-1$'th stage in the James construction $JS^2\simeq\Omega S^3$) and $Y=\Omega X$. These appear naturally in a number of applications. The loop sum operation makes $Y$ into an $H$-space. Is it known whether this is commutative? (Here and elsewhere, "commutative" means "commutative up to homotopy".) One basic idea is that the loop space of any $H$-space is a commutative $H$-space. However, it is standard that $H^*(X;\mathbb{Q})=\mathbb{Q}[x]/(x^{p^n})$, and it is easy to see that this does not admit any Hopf algebra structure, so $X$ is not an $H$-space. On the other hand, there is a James-Hopf map $h\colon JS^2\to JS^{2p^n}$. A well-known calculation in cohomology shows that $X$ is the fibre of $h$, so $Y$ is the fibre of $\Omega h$. The domain of $\Omega h$ is $\Omega JS^2\simeq\Omega^2S^3\simeq\Omega^3\mathbb{H}P^\infty$. The codomain is $\Omega JS^{2p^n}\simeq\Omega^2S^{2p^n+1}$. Here $S^{2p^n+1}$ is not a loop space, but it is an old theorem that it admits a commutative product (as does any odd-dimensional $p$-local sphere). Thus, the domain and codomain of $\Omega h$ have some extra commutativity to spare. On the other hand, $h$ is not a loop map, so $\Omega h$ is not obviously a double loop map, so it may be that the extra structure on the (co)domain cannot be brought into play. One can check that the map $H_*(Y;\mathbb{Z}/p)\to H_*(\Omega^2S^3;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is injective, and $H_*(\Omega^2S^3;\mathbb{Z}/p)$ is commutative, so there is no obvious primary homological obstruction to commutativity of $Y$. There is a canonical map $JS^2\to\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ which is a rational equivalence. This restricts to give a rational equivalence $X\to\mathbb{C}P^{p^n-1}$, which in turn gives a rational equivalence $Y\to\Omega\mathbb{C}P^{p^n-1}$. Using the fibration $S^{2p^n-1}\to\mathbb{C}P^{p^n-1}\to\mathbb{C}P^\infty$ one can check that $Y$ is rationally equivalent to $\Omega S^{2p^n-1}\times S^1$ and thus to $K(\mathbb{Q},2p^n-2)\times K(\mathbb{Q},1)$. This has an obvious commutative product, and I think it works out that this is the only possible product up to homotopy. We therefore deduce that $Y_{\mathbb{Q}}$ is commutative, but I do not think that this approach gives useful information integrally.
