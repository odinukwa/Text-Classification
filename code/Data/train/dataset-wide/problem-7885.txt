The best solution that I can think of is one that analysts have already embraced: Use the category of linear maps, but enrich the category over itself. In other words, make $\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)$ into a Banach space as well using operator norm. Then it isn't so bad that all $n$-dimensional Banach spaces are isomorphic. Since the isomorphisms have norms themselves, you can ask how well they are isomorphic. Strictly speaking, you can't enrich a category over itself, because that's circular. However, there is a way out of that in category theory; self-enrichment is called "internal Hom" and there are axioms for it. It is closely related to making the category into a tensor category, and finite-dimensional Banach spaces are that too. Another way of saying is this: A category in which everything is isomorphic is a groupoid, plus some non-invertible maps. That may seem unsatisfying. The $n$-dimensional Banach spaces are indeed a groupoid, but they are a normed groupoid, which is not so bad. 

As I understand it, the quotient C(Q) = k[[Q]]/[,] is the (completed) vector space of formal linear combinations of oriented circuits in Q. Define a detour in Q to be an edge e and an oriented path p with the same source and sink as e. For every detour (e,p), there is a detour operator D(e,p). Given a circuit s, D(e,p)(s) is a sum of terms for each occurrence of e in s; each term is obtained by replacing that occurrence of e by p. Then the image I(S) of J(S) appears to be the span of all D(e,p)(S). If I have all of that straight, then I can't think of a significant condition to guarantee that there is a rigid potential S. However, I can think of a significant condition to guarantee that there isn't one. Suppose for simplicity that the quiver Q has no parallel edges. Consider further just the shortest non-trivial circuits in C(Q); they span C(Q)g, where g is the oriented girth of Q. For these circuits, the only detour operators D(e,p) that matter are the trivial ones with p = e. In other words, you have no choice but to replace an edge e with itself. But often C(Q)g is bigger than the space of edges, i.e., Q could have more shortest cycles than it has edges. In this case, just for dimension reasons, I(S) can't contain C(Q)g. What bothers me is that if this is correct, then Derksen, Weyman, and Zelevinsky worked a little harder than necessary to make their Example 8.6. 

I'm not even a number theorist, but when I was in grad school I took a one-semester course from Hartshorne, using his book. I felt that it carried a powerful message, more abstract and more general than what I needed for any purpose, but still really interesting. We only made it to the beginning of the third chapter, but that was enough. In fact, without entirely realizing it, I was taking a lot of hard commutative algebra results on faith in the homework, but somehow it was okay. So I would ask whether Hartshorne is exactly what you want; it exactly explains what you say is missing from your experience. You don't have to and shouldn't read it page by page, confirming every assertion. You can learn from this book using the spiral method. I do not know "Geometry of Schemes", although a book with that title and those authors sounds good too. What I can say is that Hartshorne is especially enthusiastic about Grothendieck's perspective on algebraic geometry. Again, even though I had no career reason to care, I ended up wanting to prove things Grothendieck style: using schemes, with the same argument in characteristic 0 and positive characteristic, with proper schemes as a replacement for projective varieties, etc. 

I'm still the chair of the math arXiv advisory committee, which admittedly hasn't done a whole lot lately, and one of the global math moderators. No, there has not been any dramatic change in the management of the arXiv at Cornell. If anything, I wish that by now more might have changed. The arXiv has always had the bare minimum funding, sometimes less than the bare minimum. They have never had polished public relations to properly explain small changes in policy. (Actually even wealthy Internet companies sometimes stir up confusion when they make changes.) At some informal level, they/we have always worried about duplicate submissions, and near duplicates, and errata posted as new papers. And yes there is a new text overlap tool to detect both plagiarism and self-plagiarism. There is no good, rigorous way to draw the line for any of these issues. (Just as there isn't at MathOverflow --- what exactly is an "exact duplicate" of a previous question?) Regardless, if your submission is rejected, you do have the right to "file" an appeal with the Cornell staff. If it is a plausibly sane appeal, then they should show it to the math moderators and/or the math advisory committee, more likely the former these days. One perfectly valid consideration is to have the arXiv correspond to what is published in journals. Although there are cases where strict adherence to that rule is untenable. For instance, my mother and I have a joint paper in the Annals of Mathematics that appeared twice just because the first time, the paper had TeX symbol encoding errors. Also, I personally think that this posting is reasonable for MathOverflow. However, it would have been better with a less suspecting tone. The arXiv doesn't always make the best impression, but long-time users know that actually it has gotten better over the years. For a long time it had a reputation as a "user belligerent" web site. Even then, it was still a force for good, obviously. 

The question is basically jumping to conclusions about page 181 of baby Rudin. (May he rest in peace.) He says there, "We now define $x^\alpha$ for any real $\alpha$ and any $x > 0$. The continuity and monotonicity of $E$ and $L$ show that this definition leads to the same result as the previously suggested one." Well, Rudin does not say what might or might not go wrong when $x = 0$. The answer is that when $\alpha > 0$, then you can equally well ask for $f(x) = x^\alpha$ to be continuous and monotonic, and then it has a continuous extension to $x = 0$. I have not seen a reasonable alternative definition of $0^\alpha$ for any question in real analysis. This is so even though when $x < 0$ and $\alpha$ is either irrational or has an even denominator, then you can only reasonably say that $x^\alpha$ is either undefined or complex and multivalued. The only reason that Rudin would exclude $x = 0$ is that his formula $e^{\alpha \log x}$ doesn't work, and because $0^\alpha = \infty$ (unsigned, not $+\infty$) when $\alpha < 0$. A less trivial version of the same issue occurs when you look at the entropy of the vector $\vec{x}$ when $||\vec{x}||_1 = 1$, i.e. $$H(\vec{x}) = \sum_k -x_k (\log x_k).$$ This is related to the derivative of the $p$-norm as $p \to 1$. In this case when $x_k = 0$, you still define the term in the sum as $0$, by continuous extension of $f(x) = x(\log x)$. 

An integral kernel is, of course, an integrable generalization $K(x,y)$ of a matrix $M_{j,k}$. You could very loosely call this a "kernel" in the sense of the "core" of the formula for a integral linear operator. For comparison, Wiktionary tells me that in German, a KerngehÃ¤use is an apple core, while Kernphysik is nuclear physics. But mainly, I think that the two uses of kernel, one for the null space and one for an integration matrix, is just a terrible collision of terminology that became standard by accident. It's nice when a mathematical term is an inspired metaphor or neologism. For instance the word "spectrum" for the set of eigenvalues of an operator was not just inspired, but also prescient and profound. (As I understand it, the term was chosen by mathematicians, by analogy with spectral lines in chemistry, shortly before the development of quantum mechanics.) But sometimes we're just unlucky, or maybe collectively stupid. As Jan Kolar points out, the kernel of an operating system is a third metaphorical use of the word that makes vastly more sense. 

The Calculus Room. Instead of having each calculus TA sit in his or her office and wait for students, they are assigned times in one big help room called "The Calculus Room". This is a much more efficient system that helps more students per hour of labor. We have a grade distribution system called "MyUCDavis" that I use a lot. Students can see all recorded grades quickly, throughout the entire quarter. They can also see their rank on each test (and HW) and a histogram of test scores. I imagine that Moodle can do something like this too. I like it because the students can know where they stand, and because I don't like face-to-face questions about grades. Also, I of course recommend posting homework and solution sets on the web, but these days that should go without saying. WebWork. We just started using WebWork after a negative experience with another system. It is not perfect, but it is a genuinely helpful educational tool. Enough human attention to homework is better in principle, but grading homework in calculus can easily deteriorate to the point that WebWork is better. Cheap/free textbooks. This is more about saving the students' money than ours, but in the face of a 30% fee hike in one year, we are eager to create goodwill. When a good choice is available, I like the model of using a book that is both sold in print and has a free or nearly free PDF. (Or maybe we can arrange to print and bind such a book at the copy shop.) The first really good book in this model that we used was Hatcher, Algebraic Topology, but more recently there are others. I respect ideas such as wiki-books and teaching with Wikipedia as experiments and supplements, but they are not presently a good substitute for a tried-and-true, structured textbook. Slowly, incrementally try to raise standards. For instance, we recently shifted our 3-quarter intro analysis so that the first quarter is lower division. The first quarter is taught in the style of Spivak's classic, Calculus. (But Spivak is expensive. As of this year, we use Thomson, Bruckner, Bruckner, because it's a very nice textbook, and the PDF is only one dollar.) More commonly, we just revise the syllabus of this or that course to make it more interesting. We do not have a two-track system for good students vs bad students and I suspect that I wouldn't want it. The students are free to take harder or easier courses within a certain range.
