The motion group of $\mathbb R^2$, noted by $G=M(2)$ is the semi-direct product of $\mathbb R^2$ with the special orthogonal group $K = SO(2)$. A well known fact is that the unitary dual $\hat{G}$, of $G$ is precisely the collection [see, Sugiura, M.: Unitary Representations and Harmonic Analysis. Kodansha Scientific books, Tokyo (1975), p: 165]: $$\{\pi_\lambda,\, \lambda\in>0 \}\cup\{\chi_n: \, n\in \mathbb Z \},$$ where $[\pi_{\lambda}(z,e^{i\alpha})u](s) = e^{i\lambda \left<z,e^{is}\right>} u(s-\alpha)$ and where $\chi_n(z,e^{i\alpha})=e^{in\alpha}$. Now, the infinite dimensional, unitary irreducible representations of the motion group $M(n)$ of $\mathbb R^n$ is given by [see, N. I. Vilenkin, (1978). Special functions and the theory of group representations (Vol. 22). American Mathematical Soc]: For each $\lambda>0$, a unitary representation $\pi_{\lambda}$ of $M(n)$ realized on $L^2(S^{n-1})$ is \begin{align*} (*) \quad [\pi_{\lambda}(a,k)u](\xi) = e^{i\lambda \left<x,\xi\right>}\, u(k^{-1}\xi), \end{align*} for $(x,k)\in M(n)=\mathbb R^n \rtimes SO(n)$ and $u \in L^2(S^{n-1})$. Apart from these family, we have another family $\{\chi_m, m \in ? \}$, of one dimensional unitary representations of $M(n)$, which ? Is what it is $\chi_n(x,k)=e^{i m.k}, m=(m_1, \dots, m_n) \in \mathbb Z^{n} $ with $m.k= m_1 k_1 + \dots + m_n k_n$. Or what ? Thank you in advance 

Let me outline the classical proof and explain why I am interested in this question. Choose some function $g(X,Y)$. Then, \begin{align} E[ (X-E[X|Y]) g(X,Y)] \le \left| E[ (X-E[X|Y]) g(X,Y)] \right| \le \sqrt{ E \left[ (X-E[X|Y])^2 \right] E[g(X,Y)^2] }. \end{align} Therefore, \begin{align} E \left[ (X-E[X|Y])^2 \right] \ge \frac{\left| E[ (X-E[X|Y]) g(X,Y)] \right|}{E[g(X,Y)^2]}. \end{align} The proof is completed by choosing $g(x,y)=\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(x,y) ) $ and noting that then $ E[ (X-E[X|Y]) g(X,Y)]=-1$. This gives us the Cramer-Rao lower bound \begin{align} E \left[ (X-E[X|Y])^2 \right] \ge \frac{1}{E \left[ \left(\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(X,Y) ) \right)^2 \right]}. \end{align} The choice of $g(X,Y)=\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(x,y) ) $ always seemed mysterious to me (but this is not the main reason for ask this question). That is why I am wondering whether there is a more "natural" proof where the quantity $\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(x,y) )$ appearance is more obvious. For example, it would be nice if we can derive an inequality by showing that \begin{align} E \left[ (X-E[X|Y])^2 \right] = \frac{1}{E \left[ \left(\frac{d}{dx} \log (f_{XY}(X,Y) ) \right)^2 \right]}+c, \end{align} where $c$ is non-negative. 

What are the Kontsevich-Soibelman Stability conditions ? How is it related to Bridgeland's Stability (or Douglas' $\pi$ - stability on D-branes) ? Why do we need to consider Kontsevich-Soibelman stability. 

First of all, I am sorry for there are a bunch of questions (though all related)and may not be well framed. What are the DT invariants in physics. When one is computing DT invariants for a Calabi-Yau manifold, what is one computing in physics? What about the generalized (motivic) version? Also what does the Gromov-Witten/DT correspondence (MNOP) say in terms of physics, are there (strong) physical reasons to believe such a correspondence. Please suggest some useful references. Thanks. 

Let $F(A)$ be a class of real-analytic function on an interval $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ minus the zero function. We have the following theorem for $F(A)$. 

Let $f_V$ be a pdf of random variable $V$ where \begin{align} V=U+Z \end{align} and where $U$ and $Z$ are independent and $Z$ is Gaussian. Moreover, suppose that $|U| \le A$. Can we find the upper bound on the number of modes of $V$? Note that the the pdf $V$ is given by \begin{align} f_V(v)=E\left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(v-U)^2}{2}}\right] \end{align} I am actually not interested in a very tight bound. I more interested in the methods that can be used to produce such bounds. 

Any reference that we can find the following series expansion $$f_{\alpha}(a) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \, (n+a)^{^\alpha}\, L^{(1)}_{n}(a),$$ where $a>0, \alpha>0$ and $L^{(1)}_{n}(.)$ are the generalized Laguerre polynomials. Thanks 

I would like to know, can we say that the "groups of Heisenberg type" where introduced by A. Kaplan in "Kaplan, A. (1980). Fundamental solutions for a class of hypoelliptic PDE generated by composition of quadratic forms. Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 258(1), 147-153." are introduced to generalize the classical Heisenberg group $\mathbb R^2\times \mathbb R$ or else ? Thank you in advance 

Let $X$ be a random variable with the distribution $F$ (cdf). What are the extreme points of the sets of the form: \begin{align} P_1&=\left\{ F: \int |x|^k dF\le c \right\},\\ P_2&=\left\{ F: |X| \le d \right\},\\ P_3&=\left\{ F: \int |x|^k dF\le c, \, |X| \le d \right\}.\\ \end{align} In this question it was shown for the set $P_1$, the set of extrem points are all two mass disributions. What about $P_2$ and $P_3$? It would also be nice if some one can provide a good reference where the subject of finding extreme points of a set of distributions can be found. I am familiar with this reference. However, was thinking maybe there is a more modern work or survey on this. Edit 1; Here is the definition of an extrem point: An extreme point of a convex set, $A$, is a point $x \in A$, with the property that if $x = ty + (1 âˆ’ t)z$ with $y,z \in A $and $t \in [0, 1]$, then $y = x$ and/or $z = x$. Note that all of the sets above are convex. 

I would like compute the following $$I_{t,x,y} = \int_{\mathbb S^2} e^{-i\left<t,\omega\right>} \, e^{-i\left< A(\omega)x,y\right>} \, d\sigma(\omega); $$ where $\mathbb S^2$ is the two-dimensional sphere, $t\in \mathbb R^3, \, x,y\in \mathbb R^4$ and $A(.)$ is the matrix given by $$ A(s_1,s_2,s_3):= \left( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 & s_{1} & s_{2} & s_{3} \\ -s_{1} & 0 & s_{3} & -s_{2} \\ -s_{2} & -s_{3} & 0 & s_{1} \\ -s_{3} & s_{2} & -s_{1}& 0 \end{array} \right)$$ for all $s_1, s_2, s_3 \in \mathbb R$. 

I am reading some work on Mirror Symmetry from Physics perspective,the physicists seem to use some aspects of BRST quantization and BRST cohomology. What is BRST Quantization and BRST cohomology, in realm of Mathematics. More precisely, What are the BRST complexes, how do we get this cohomology, what is the relation (if any) of this cohomology theory to say de Rham or Cech cohomology. Where do the mathematicians use this theory. What is it in context of $N =2 $ Superconformal field Theory, most relevant for Mirror Symmetry. I appreciate both physics and mathematical ideas. 

Suppose that we have two independent random variables $V$ and $W$ over $\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that $W$ has a probability density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. My question: Can we find conditions on the density of $W$ the conditional expectation \begin{align} \phi_V(t)=E[V|V+W=t], \end{align} is unique with respect to a distribution of $V$. In other words, can we show conditions on $W$ under which $\phi_V(t)=\phi_U(t) , \forall t$ would imply that the distributions of $U$ and $V$ are identical? This question is very similar in spirit to the uniqueness theorem for the characteristic function. I feel the following decompositin is the key: \begin{align} \phi_V(t)=E[V|V+W=t]= \frac{E \left[V f_W(t-V)\right]}{E \left[f_W(t-V)\right]}. \end{align} 

I just found an English translation of Serre's FAC at Richard Borcherds' Algebraic Geometry course web page. I really want to read it sometime. I am beginner in Algebraic Geometry, just started learning Scheme theory (Hartshorne Ch II). My question is : Shall I read coherent sheaves and the cohomology from the translation of Serre's FAC or from the Hartshorne, this is going to be my first encounter with Coherent sheaves. Do you recommend FAC as an introduction to Coherent Sheaves. My prime interest at present is the derived categories of coherent sheaves on projective varieties, specially the work of Tom Bridgeland and the Mirror Symmetry.
