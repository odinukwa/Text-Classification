I just want to add an argument that $\mathsf{Cat}$ is also a counterexample (partly because I suspect that Todd chose to use $\mathsf{Pos}$ instead on account of it not being obvious that $\mathsf{Cat}$ has a dense generating object :). The same examples that show $\mathsf{Pos}$ is not regular should show that $\mathsf{Cat}$ is not regular. So the question is how to find a dense generating object for $\mathsf{Cat}$. In fact $\sum_n \Delta^n$, the coproduct of the dense generating set of finite linear orders / simplices is a dense generator in $\mathsf{Cat}$ / $\mathsf{sSet}$. This is not immediate, as Zhen Lin points out above -- the coproduct of the objects of a dense generating set need not even be a generating object in general, as evidenced by sheaves over any nontrivial space (with the representables as the dense generating family). Nonetheless, $\sum_n\Delta^n$ is a dense generator in $\mathsf{Cat}$ or in $\mathsf{sSet}$ because every representable is a retract of $\sum_n \Delta^n$, and a subcategory is dense iff its closure under retracts is dense (since if $i: C \to \tilde C$ is a full subcategory such that every object of $\tilde C$ is a retract of an object of $\tilde C$, then $\mathsf{Hom}(i,1): [\tilde C^\mathrm{op}, \mathsf{Set}] \to [C^\mathrm{op}, \mathsf{Set}]$ is an equivalence, i.e. $i$ is a Morita equivalence). Actually, in $\mathsf{Cat}$, it's clear that the three-element set $\{[0],[1],[2]\} = \{1,2,3\}$ consisting of the simplices of dimension $\leq 2$ / ordinals $\leq 3$ is dense, but these objects are all retracts of the single simplex $[2]$ / ordinal 3. So this object gives an even simpler dense generator for $\mathsf{Cat}$. The (nerve of) the ordinal $\omega$ would also do for a dense generator in either category. As Todd observed, by the theorem discussed by Vitale in the notes he linked to, 

Very often, a bicategory of type 1 is included into a bicategory of type 2 to form a proarrow equipment, e.g. 

An addendum to my comment to Qiaochu's answer, which amounts to expanding on Qiaochu's answer more generally: If we just add splitting of idempotents to our requirements on $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$, then $\mathrm{Comm}(\mathcal{C})$ is co-extensive! That is, the following equivalent conditions on a symmetric monoidal category $(\mathcal{C},\otimes)$ guarantee that $\mathrm{Comm}(\mathcal{C})$ is co-extensive: 

and to ask Question B: Does $(1) \Leftrightarrow (3)$ hold? even though I don't even know whether (3) holds for any $\mathcal{C}$ (unless every object is fibrant)! So I might as well also ask: Question C: Is there an example of a model category $\mathcal{C}$ where not every object is fibrant where (3) holds? 

Say that a functor $F: \mathcal{W} \to \mathcal{C}_i$ is additive if $F\mathcal{E} W\to F W \times F W$ is an equivalence for all $W \in \mathcal{W}$, where $\mathcal{E}W$ the Waldhausen category of exact sequences $w' \to w \to w''$ in $W$ and the map projects onto $(w',w'')$. Consider the following functors: 

Lurie's definition of a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category is a cocartesian fibration of $\infty$-categories $C^\otimes \to \Gamma^{op}$. Starting with a special $\Gamma$-category, we take the Grothendieck construction and apply the ordinary nerve to obtain one of these things. Lurie's model for $\infty$-operads has been shown to be equivalent to dendroidal sets. Symmetric monoidal categories are just operads with a certain representability property, so in particular this gives an equivalence between symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories in Lurie's sense and a certain subcategory of dendroidal sets. Dendroidal sets are Quillen equivalent to simplicial operads via a dendroidal homotopy coherent nerve. I'm assuming this includes the colored case. 

In the Elephant, Theorem B2.6.8 shows that finite limits commute with filtered colimits in $\mathsf{Set}$ using arguments that can apparently be internalized to any $\mathcal{S}$ which is Barr-exact with reflexive coequalizers. Let's call such a category good. I expected Johnstone's proof to be a straightforward internalization of the proof found, say, in Mac Lane. But in fact he relies on reducing preservation of pullbacks to preservation of binary products, as Buschi Sergio attempted to do in his answer. Johnstone reduces from statement 1 to statement 2 as follows: 

Note that (4), and a fortiori (3), holds when $X$ is projective. If $X$ is an open subscheme of a normal $\bar X$ which has any of the above properties, and if the codimension of the complement $\bar X \setminus X$ is $\geq 2$, then by Hartog's lemma, $X$ inherits the property. 

I'll do you one better: you don't need a generating set of acyclic cofibrations. You just need what Simpson calls a pseudo-generating set, i.e. a set of acyclic cofibrations which suffices to detect fibrant objects and fibrations between fibrant objects (i.e. an object is fibrant iff it lifts against every morphism in your pseudo-generating set, and similarly for a map between fibrant objects being a fibration). That is, I claim your observation still holds if you only check with the morphisms of a pseudo-generating set rather than an actual generating set of acyclic cofibrations. Explicit generating sets of acyclic cofiberations are hard to find, but pseudo-generating sets abound. For example, the inner horns plus the endcap inclusion of the walking isomsomorphism form a pseudo-generating set for the Joyal model structure. A great source of them comes from Cisinski-Olschok theory: their construction $S \mapsto \Lambda(S)$ is a minimal way of getting a pseudo-generating set out of a set of morphisms. Because the construction of $\Lambda(S)$ is explicit and combinatorial, one can often show that $\Lambda(S)$ is in the cofibrant closure of $S$, so that $S$ was already a pseudo-generating set (and showing this is an essentially combinatorial exercise). For example, this works in the case of the Joyal model structure. My impression is that everything that Cisinski/Olschok do is very explicit, and is probably constructive. 

(the main idea) A manifold is $M$ a space with an open cover $\{U_i\}$ by copies of the model space $\mathbb{R}^n$, with transition functions coming from the diffeomorphism group. A vector bundle $V \to X$ is a map where the base $X$ has an open cover $\{U_i\}$ on which the map pulls back to copies of the standard map, which is a projection from $\mathbb{R}^n \times U_i \to U_i$, with transition functions required to be fiberwise in the general linear group. An orientation on a (compact) manifold $M$ is a choice of a fundamental class, i.e. $[M] \in H_n(M)$ which restricts to a generator on the local homology group $H_n(M,M-x)$ at each point $x \in M$. An orientation on a vector bundels $V \to X$ is a choice of Thom class, i.e. $v \in H^n(V,V-0)$ (where $0$ is the zero section of $V$) which restricts to a generator on the local cohomology group $H^n(V_x, V_x - 0)$ for each point $x \in X$, where $V_x$ is the fiber at $x$. Manifolds have a Pontrjagin-Thom construction, while vector bundles have a Thom construction. The idea that you can "collapse at infinity" is something in common. This connection may be me grasping at straws -- anyway, the two constructions are already closely related: the Thom construction of the normal bundle receives the map from the manifold in the Pontrjagin-Thom construction. (attempt at (1) in a more Cech-like language:) A manifold is some kind of simplicial object of model spaces. A vector bundle is some kind of simplicial object of maps to a structure group (satisfying a cocycle condition). (attempt at (1) in a more sheaf-like language:) I think a manifold $M$ is some kind of locally free sheaf on the site of Euclidean spaces and $C^\infty$-functions. The sheaf of sections of a vector bundle $V \to X$ is a locally free module over the sheaf $C^0(X)$ of continuous functions on $X$. 

Clearly, if $X$ is self-dual and idempotent, then $X$ is both well-idempotent and co-well-idempotent. Conversely, I ask Questions: 

As above, a pointwise extension along a fully faithful functor has an isomorphism for a comparison cell. A functor $F$ is dense if and only if its left Kan extension along itself $\mathrm{Lan}_F F$ exists, is pointwise, and is isomorphic to the identity functor. To show that taking total derived functors is functorial, one needs that they are pointwise extensions. To show that the total derived functors of a Quillen adjunction form an adjunction between homotopy categories, one needs to know that they are pointwise extensions. 

Putting it all together, if you have a finitely-generated commutative semigroup $C$, then you can think of it as a finite lattice of a bunch of finite abelian groups equipped with certain positive cones, each of which has a nilpotent commutative semigroup on which it acts, with homomorphisms between these corresponding to the relations in the lattice. 

I suspect that no very satisfying answer to this question is known, so let me just point out that there are a lot of different things one might mean by a "category-theoretic understanding" of a large-cardinal axiom. I am far from an expert, so I hope that others can help flesh this out and correct me, but here are some themes that I happen to have seen in the literature: 

Details: Let $(\mathcal C,\otimes, I)$ be a symmetric monoidal closed category with dualizing object $D$, and write $[-,-]$ for the internal hom. We may define $I_\bullet = I$, $\bullet = \otimes$, $A^\ast = [A,D]$, $I_\circ= D$, and $A \circ B = [[A,D]\otimes[B,D],D] = (A^\ast \bullet A^\ast)^\ast$. Note that 

What you're asking about is the equivalence between two standard definitions of $Pro(C)$. I've just added an explanation of the equivalence to the nlab page. 

I don't think you can construct $T(S)$ as a monoidal category. It's more common to construct $T(S)$ as a bicategory with object set $S$. (see the end for comments on regarding it as a monoidal category) Let $I(S)$ denote the indiscrete category on $S$. Then a lax 2-functor $I(S) \to M$ (where $M$ is considered as a 1-object bicategory -- more generally $M$ could be an arbitrary bicategory) is the same as an $M$-enriched category with object set $S$ (this goes back to Benabou's original paper on bicategories). For any bicategory $B$ there is a lax morphism classifier $B'$ such that a weak 2-functor $B' \to C$ is the same as a lax 2-functor $B \to C$ (where $C$ is a bicategory) [actually, I'm not quite certain of this -- if we were talking about strict 2-categories and strict 2-functors rather than weak ones I'd be more certain. You can fit into this framework by replacing $M$ with a monoidal category that is strictly associative]. So $I(S)'$ has the property you're looking for. But it's not exactly a monoidal category -- it's bicategory with many objects. I think this construction is "well-known". For example, a construction with a similar flavor comes in Gepner and Haugseng's definition of an enriched $\infty$-category: it $S$ is a Kan complex, then let $I(S)$ be the "indiscrete simplicial Kan complex on $S$", with $I(S)_n = S^{n+1}$. A monoidal $\infty$-category $M$ is also sort of simplicial quasicategory, and an $M$-enriched category with object space $S$ is a map of bisimplicial sets $I(S) \to M$ (well, I think they speak in terms of cartesian fibrations over $\Delta$ rather simplicial objects, but these are equivalent by straightening/unstraightening). If you want $TS$ to be a monoidal category rather than a bicategory, then I think you're in luck because the inclusion from monoidal categories into bicategories should have a left adjoint, just like the inclusion of monoids into category. So just apply this left adjoint to $I(S)'$ above. This adjoint is kind of weird -- you freely add composites for morphisms with non-composable domain and codomain. But in the case of such a simple bicategory as this, I suppose it's not so bad -- and should look basically like you describe.
