You are badly confusing rate of progress with state of knowledge. Yes, the Turks in the Middle Ages had greater technological prowess than Europeans, but they were already woefully under-achieving in terms of progress. The origins for this state of affairs lies in the different progressions of collapse of the Roman Empire in the West and the East. In the West, numerous diverse tribes overran the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century CE and promptly set to squabbling over the spoils amongst themselves. At this same time (possibly in consequence) there was also an agricultural collapse in the West that for a few hundred years delayed the restoration of a middle class with the leisure time to pursue scientific research and engineering development. By the time of Charlemagne in the 8th century the [monastic and cathedral schools that evolve into] universities are being established across Western Europe, and the underpinnings of the Renaissance are being laid. Bell-making is being perfected, which will provide great returns when the (comparatively) simpler metallurgy of cannon-making must be mastered. Rapid advances in iron-working are sowing the seeds of knowledge that will allow iron as well as bronze cannons to be cast reliably, and the development of iron-barrelled firearms. Double-entry bookkeeping is developed, allowing the formation and management of share-equity corporations to finance exploration as well as scientific development and insurance. Although starting from a much retarded base, by the early middle ages scientific and engineering progress in Western Europe is already out-stripping what is occurring in the Middle East, rapidly incorporating and expanding on all Eastern ideas that are encountered. In contrast, the wave of Muslim conquest in the 7th ad 8th centuries that dismantled all of the Eastern Roman Empire (except Anatolia and the Balkans) was not followed by an agricultural collapse. The middle class continued in existence in its conquered countries, carrying forward the accumulated knowledge of Roman, Greek and Parthian civilization. However, from a starting point a few hundred years in advance of Western Europe, in barely as many years the Muslim world stifles all research and finds itself a scientific backwater, with the Ottoman Empire rapidly being identified as the sick man of Europe from its total incompetence in governance, science, engineering and military capability. By this time, in the 15th and 16th centuries and extending to the modern day, it is the Muslim world of the Middle East that is seemingly incapable of incorporating any Western ideas and technologies into its culture.

This article seems to be an unbiased analysis of Herbert Hoover's reaction to the Crash of 1929. It paints him as a relative activist economically, by the standards of the day, but both over-hyped during the election of 1928 and overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the collapse that was occurring. It is worth remembering that he began construction of the eponymous Hoover Dam (approved by Coolidge in December 1928) as one attempt to ease the unemployment of the Depression. 

It is often characterized by a relaxation of Victorian Morals, which may have more to do with the nostalgia of looking back at it from the post-war era than of any true distinction from the epoch that preceded it. 

Although Gutenberg is justly famous for being the inventor of the Printing Press, the invention itself is grossly misnamed in that appellation. What Gutenberg actually invented, and which changed the world, is the Movable- And Reusable-Type Printing Press. By devising a system in which mass-produced lead type, cheaply cast in large quantities, could be rapidly set; used for printing; and then disassembled to await the next print job, Gutenberg revolutionized how literature was disseminated. Prior mechanisms involved the painstaking creation of block text, specific to each print job by master craftsmen. In Gutenberg's new system, only the molds for the typed letters needed to be made by master craftsmen; the type itself could be made by less skilled journeymen. The speed difference arose from the availability of vast quantities of type, in various font families and sizes, in local print shops. Setting this type could be done by a skilled typesetter at perhaps a quarter the speed of reading it. The actual print runs were comparable, but the typeset was available in hours rather than weeks or months. The simpler Roman alphabet, compared to those of China and Japan, certainly would have been a motivating factor for Gutenberg's invention, but perhaps simply made the entire notion imaginable. One can start with 52 upper- and lower-case letter, 10 digits, and a few punctuation marks, totaling about 70 molds, compared to a basic vocabulary in Oriental characters of several hundred to a few thousand starting characters. Update: As noted below moveable-type existed in China for a few hundred years before Guttenberg, but the type characters were individually fired porcelain, thus much more expensive to make than Guttenberg's molded lead type, and not practical for large-scale printing. This reduced their effect on the cost of a book, according to the economic analysis presented by Lennart. 

Although I only comment below to the English Common Law practice, the Anglo-Saxon traditions underpinning it originated from the North Sea coasts of Friesland and Jutland. Contemporary traditions in those areas were undoubtedly similar to start; and then evolved according to variant circumstances. Class notes on Description and History of Common Law provides a brief history of the initial devlopment of a centralized Common Law following the Norman Conquest: 

Entrance varied dramatically by time and place, with students enrolling at Oxford or Paris around the age of 14 to study the liberal arts, and at Bologna around the age of 30 to study law. Historically the curriculum of a liberal arts degree was first the study of the trivium of grammar, rhetoric and logic, followed by the quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, music and astronomy. During the Renaissance the curriculum expanded to include the Aristotelian sciences of physics, metaphysics, and moral philosophy. All studies were in Latin, though Greek might have been used for the study of Euclid's geometry, and later for the study of the Aristotelian sciences. Note that the initial trivium, taught in Latin, was actually the study of Latin grammar; of Latin rhetoric, and of Latin logic. and thus was the study of first the written language, the spoken language, and then of constructing written and spoken argument in the language. So far from requiring a solid knowledge of Latin prior to entrance, the first few years of a student's studies were devoted to its mastery: written; spoken; and as a means of analytical thought. Of course to be recognized as a candidate for sponsorship at one of these institutions a young boy would likely be demonstrating aptitude in the language. For the southern universities modeled on Bologna, studying for an advanced degrees in law, medicine or theology would have as prerequisite prior knowledge of the liberal arts. Note that the founding of Oxford( teaching 1096, recognized 1167) and Cambridge (1209) precedes the founding of Eton College (1441) by hundreds of years. The concept of a grammar school, where one might begin the study of the first of the liberal arts at a younger age and prior to entering university, post dates the concept of university by centuries. 

The best English translation of the relevant statement from Strabo (Book VIII, Ch. 6, Section 20) I can find is: 

Just the opposite was in fact true; the Western Allies were deathly afraid in 1942 that the Soviet Union might collapse (a la 1917) prior to their being able to open up a Second Front. Later, in 1943 and 1944, they were afraid that the Soviets might stop at the pre-war (ie 1940-1) borders and declare a truce with the Germans. Both of these factors would stimulate the Western Allies to find ways to bleed off German resources in tertiary theatres, as they successfully did in Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy prior to the D-Day invasions of June 1944. In The Last Lion - Defender of the Realm, Manchester and Reid note that at Casablanca Roosevelt said to Churchill that there would not be sufficient landing craft for a French invasion until Spring 1944. Admittedly this is partially a political decision, as once the Torch landings had been provisioned priority would shift to enabling offensive amphibious actions in the Pacific theatre for 12 months before shifting back to Europe. However even the immense economic engine of the U.S. had limitations, and took time to tool up and then produce the necessary machines of war. However the additional time was probably required anyways. Early landings on the French North-West coast were problematic for the same reason that the Germans never seriously contemplated Sea Lion - amphibious landings in the face of determined opposition are difficult, and require extensive preparation. Without the Hobart Funnies that so eased landing on the British beaches Gold, Sword and Juno, and the Mulberry Harbours that enabled large-scale supply prior to capturing and clearing Cherbourg and Brest, the D-Day successes were far from guaranteed. All of these were developed in the 12 months leading up to June 1944. 

At some point during the war my Opa (who had a managerial position in a spice factory of some sort) managed to swap out 1/2 a box car of sugar destined for the Eastern Front with cement powder. He traded this for other supplies as well as several cases of expensive Bols gin. This Bols gin was now available as a bribe in case my father was discovered - but fortunately it never came to that. My Aunt proudly recalled, to my brother and I, being instructed: 

Update: I found this complete History of U.S. Army Grade Insignia through 1866. I note that the early adoption of silver jewelry resulted in a high contrast when worn over gold epaulettes. Also, as late as 1866 Second Lieutenants wore no insignia jewel while First Lieutenants and Captains wore a silver jewel with high contrast against the gold braid. This is completely consistent with the note in Wikipedia that I quoted above. 

War is not about killing every man on the opposing side; it is about killing enough men on the opposing side that none of the others have stomach for more fight. Part of winning that contest of wills called morale is retaining sufficient quantity of ammunition. A unit of archers without arrows is nothing more than prey. So while it is useful to have every archer of a unit put a dozen or so arrows into the air in rapid succession, it is expected that the shock of the resultant casualties will cause a morale break in the approaching force. Once that happens, firing more arrows is worse than useless, as those arrows are more effectively reserved for staring down the enemy, or firing at an enemy unit that has not yet been shocked into a morale failure. From this I conclude that while being able to fire that many arrows is a useful skill, it a skill that should only be exercised in the most dire circumstances, against an enemy of extremely high morale and armour. In less dire circumstances it would simply be a waste of ammunition. Update: I believe that an important assist in forcing a morale break on the opponent is making going forward more dangerous than going backward. To this end an archer nit would want to fire sufficient arrows to shock the oncoming opponent, and then dare them to repeat. Shock them again every time they recover and continue, until they get the message. Any unit with the reputation of firing after a retreating enemy has actually suffered its own morale break - by making regress as equally dangerous for the enemy as progress. 

Update: This atlas of Belgium (Austrian Netherlands) prepared by Ferraris between 1770 and 1777 for Marie Antoinette shows numerous small coal mines. There are several between Ligny and St. Amand on map #97 - Gembloux, and another south of the village of Waterloo, in the woods west of the main road. As the infamous Sand Pit near La Haye Sainte does not exist on these maps, it s possible that it too was a small coal mine excavated between 1777 and 1815. The size is right. The small-scale mining of coal at this time was for use in the small steam engines of the day, and for home heating (probably derived from the similar use of peat). Silesia, like Belgium , had numerous seams of coal near the surface. Watt's steam engine hadn't been invented yet but Newcommen's was already about 30 years old. All of this Frederick would have known about Silesia by 1740. 

We have become so familiar with the strengths of Frederick's military capabilities, we forget that he had weaknesses also, and in some cases (such as his reliance on capable subordinates) the same character trait is both a weakness and a strength, depending on circumstance. By contrast, though Napoleon inherited a plethora of capable (and better - Davout, Lannes, Massena, Desaix for starters) subordinates, he was incapable of creating any new ones (Eugene the one possible exception.). As they gradually died (or retired) the corps and divisional leadership beneath Napoleon weakened, and the Grande Armee's abilities weakened as well. 

It's historical, dating from before the two colours represented different ranks instead of different branches of the army, as a cost-saving measure (essentially). From Wikipedia: 

The battle grew from an initial reconnaissance by Longstreet's Hill's corps to determine if the shoe factory in Gettysburg had sufficient quantities to resupply several Confederate units with boots (or shoes). I think that completely summarizes the Confederate supply situation for most of the war: not just pillaging for food, but pillaging for footwear (arguably second only to his rifle in importance for an infantryman, and challenged only by his spade) because the Confederacy was unable to supply any. The notion that both sides used the bayonet during Picket's charge because they were low on ammunition borders on absurdity; they used the bayonet because they were in close physical contact, and a bayonet is much faster in close quarters than reloading to fire a bullet. No-one stops to reload in a bayonet fight and lives to tell the tale. Update: I do not mean to imply in that last paragraph that the units on Cemetery Ridge, of both sides, had ample ammunition. The troops on the ridge were undoubtedly low, having fired most of what each carried in a cartridge box while closing to contact. And after nearly three days of battle, both armies had to be running short on ammunition at hand, the Confederates likely worse off then Meade. That fact is irrelevant to the tactical situation on Cemetery Ridge; having closed to contact, both sides were forced into a bayonet duel. The point of closing to contact is to defeat the opponent with the bayonet. Both commanders likely expected that if successful in closing to contact, the Confederates would win out unless very badly outnumbered; due to their greater morale, their greater experience on average, and their greater desperation. Unfortunately for Lee, the casualties incurred in mounting Cemetery Ridge, combined with Stuart's inability to swing around the Union right and Meade' prescience the evening before, resulted in just such an outnumbering. 

As the Governor of Gaul Caesar possessed the right to employ and exercise the power of the Roman Republic (the state) throughout the province of Gaul, and hence was by definition in possession of Proconsular Imperium. 

That time frame, from Sept. 8 to October 28 1944, corresponds to the time period in which Nazi forces were driven out of Bulgaria by the Red Army during the Jassy-Kishinev Offensive following the Destruction of Army Group Center in Operation Bagration. The consequent replacement of a pro-Nazi government by a pro-Soviet one would seem quite sufficient explanation. 

Whether a national culture or the theology comes first is a chicken-and-egg problem that I will leave to the philosophers. But the Gallic culture is and historically always has been entirely intolerant of Calvinist theology, while Anglo-Saxon culture seems to regularly cycle in and out of it. 

I think it worth noting that the armor suit below was made for King Henry VIII around 1544, when he was old, overweight, and crippled by gout and his jousting injury. For a fit 20 or 30 something soldier to wear such a suit for several hours would have been hot and sweaty, but quite bearable except in the hot summer sun or the cold of winter. 

Although, as you note, millions of shells were fired before the larger battles, the damage done by these shells was largely incidental and known to be so. Of much greater significance leading up to an assault was the suppression of enemy fire while friendly troops were in No-Man's Land, and a further shock-induced delay after the barrage lifted before hostiles reacted and manned the guns. (Given the horrific firepower cast by these defences, even a few extra seconds meant many saved lives.) High Explosive shrapnel was fired because it was the most effective in suppressing enemy fire. Unfortunately, barrels heat up and expand when fired rapidly, causing the walking barrage to back up onto friendly troops. This prospect terrified the soldiers and both interfered with their need to keep close to the barrage, and caused significant friendly fire casualties. While numerous attempts had been made to calibrate this effect by (artillery) battery, based on estimated gun age, this effect varied widely from gun to gun for many additional reasons. Major General Currie in the months leading up to Vimy Ridge had every gun in the barrage individually calibrated for barrel expansion and the consequent range change by number of shells fired. Combined with providing every NCO as well as officer with a detailed schedule of the barrage's advances, the Canadian Corps was successful in keeping the entire first wave within 60 seconds of the barrage, with very light friendly fire casualties. On Easter Monday, April 9 1917, the Germans for the first time emerged from their bunkers after the barrage to find large numbers of Allied troops already in their trenches.
