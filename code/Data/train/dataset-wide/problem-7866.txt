Here is a proof for the case where $X$ is a Hausdorff space. Note that each $U_n$ is also Hausdorff in this case. A standard argument shows that the face operators of $U_\bullet$ are (surjective) local homeomorphisms, so the degeneracy operators of $U_\bullet$ are open embeddings. On the other hand, degeneracy operators are split monomorphisms, and any split monomorphism in the category of Hausdorff spaces is a closed embedding. Thus, the image of any degeneracy operator of $U_\bullet$ is a "direct summand" (i.e. clopen subspace). It more or less follows that $U_n$ decomposes according to the formula you stated. Note that the above argument can be applied to simplicial Hausdorff spaces other than hypercovers. 

Question. If $f : A \to B$ is a strong $Q$-equivalence, then must $f : A \to B$ be an isomorphism? For some $\mathbb{T}$, this is true: for example, if $\mathbb{T}$ is the theory of boolean algebras, then even weak $Q$-equivalences are isomorphisms. (Use Stone duality.) In general, we can guarantee that strong $Q$-equivalences are epimorphisms (in the sense of category theory). Also, every surjective weak $Q$-equivalence is an isomorphism. So, if $\mathbb{T}$ is an algebraic theory such that every epimorphism of $\mathbb{T}$-algebras is a surjective homomorphism (e.g. the theory of left $R$-modules for some ring $R$), then strong $Q$-equivalences are isomorphisms. But what happens otherwise – for instance, if $\mathbb{T}$ is the theory of commutative rings? 

Let $M$ be a smooth (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold and let $T(M)$ be the smooth tensor bundle on it. Is there a subspace $S \subset T(M)$ closed under (possibly infinitely many) finitary (possibly partially-defined) algebraic operations and finitely generated containing exactly the tensor fields on $M$ which are invariant under some fixed subgroup $G \le \mathrm{Diff}(M)$? In particular, the above is an open question because e.g. the $G$-invariant tensor fields have not been classified for general $G$, how about asking that $S$ contains only isometry-invariant tensor fields and in particular contains the metric tensor, inverse metric tensor, the Riemann tensor, the Ricci tensor, and the Ricci scalar? Suppose there is such an algebraic structure, and I adjoin an arbitrary tensor field to it. Will there be a non-trivial subgroup of $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ under which the extended structure is invariant? Conversely, suppose I fix a non-trivial subgroup of $H < G$. Is there an algebraic structure of the same signature invariant under $H$ containing $S$? 

Now, let $X$ and $Y$ be any two objects in $\mathcal{M}$. In order for the hom-set map $$\mathcal{M}(X, Y) \to \Ho \mathcal{M}(X, Y)$$ to be a group homomorphism, it is sufficient that the localising functor $\mathcal{M} \to \Ho \mathcal{M}$ preserve either the coproduct $X + X$ or the product $Y \times Y$. (We already know that it preserves initial and terminal objects.) Thus it suffices to take either $X$ cofibrant or $Y$ fibrant. 

This is true for abstract nonsense reasons. If $G$ is a group object in a category $\mathcal{C}$, then $G \times S$ is a group object in the slice category $\mathcal{C}_{/ S}$, and there is a natural bijection between $G$-actions on an object in $\mathcal{C}_{/ S}$ (considered as an object in $\mathcal{C}$) and $(G \times S)$-actions on the same object (considered as an object in $\mathcal{C}_{/ S}$), simply because there is a natural isomorphism $(G \times S) \times_S X \cong G \times X$. Thus, we may assume without loss of generality that $S$ is the terminal object in $\mathcal{C}$. But then $X \times Y$ has an obvious $G$-action if $X$ and $Y$ do: namely, the diagonal action. More explicitly, suppose we have actions $G \times X \to X$, $G \times Y \to Y$, and $G \times S \to S$ and $G$-equivariant morphisms $X \to S$, $Y \to S$. Then, we can define a $G$-action $G \times (X \times_S Y) \to X \times_S Y$ as the unique morphism such that these equations hold: \begin{align} (G \times (X \times_S Y) \to X \times_S Y \to X) & = (G \times (X \times_S Y) \to G \times X \to X) \\ (G \times (X \times_S Y) \to X \times_S Y \to Y) & = (G \times (X \times_S Y) \to G \times Y \to Y) \end{align} 

In every Grothendieck topos, the following sequent is valid for the natural numbers object $N$, $$x : N \vdash \bigvee_{n : \mathbb{N}} x = s^n (z)$$ where $\mathbb{N}$ is the set of natural numbers, $s : N \to N$ is the internal successor operation, and $z : 1 \to N$ is the zero element. In words, "every natural number is standard". This can be proved directly without appealing to any kind of boolean completeness theorem. However, it is false in any non-standard topos, provided one makes the appropriate allowances to deal with the fact that such toposes do not have all infinite colimits: note that in every cocomplete topos, the indicated sequent is valid if and only if the collection $\{ s^n \circ z : 1 \to N \}$ is a jointly epimorphic family. It goes without saying that non-standard toposes exist: for instance, take the elementary topos associated with any non-trivial ultrapower of $V_{\omega + \omega}$. Every elementary topos can be covered by a boolean topos: see Proposition 4.5.23 in [Sketches of an elephant, Part A]. Apparently this is a theorem of Freyd in [1972, Aspects of topoi], but I have not found the precise statement there. The construction is as follows: for an elementary topos $\mathcal{E}$, let $q$ be the local operator on $\mathcal{E}_{/ \Omega}$ defined by the formula $q (x) = ((x \Rightarrow t) \Rightarrow t)$, where $\Rightarrow$ is the Heyting implication and $t$ is the generic subobject $1 \rightarrowtail \Omega$ in $\mathcal{E}$ considered as a truth-value in $\mathcal{E}_{/ \Omega}$; then the obvious geometric morphism $\mathbf{sh}_{q} (\mathcal{E}_{/ \Omega}) \to \mathcal{E}$ is a geometric surjection. 

To avoid confusing myself, I will write $L : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C} [\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$ for the localising functor and $R : \mathcal{C} [\mathcal{W}^{-1}] \to \mathcal{C}$ for its right adjoint. (Note that $R$ is automatically fully faithful – the hard part is existence!) As you say, for any object $Y$ in $\mathcal{C} [\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$, $R Y$ is automatically a $\mathcal{W}$-local object in $\mathcal{C}$: indeed, for any object $Z$ in $\mathcal{C}$, $Z$ is a $\mathcal{W}$-local object if and only if $\mathcal{C} (-, Z) : \mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ factors through $L : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C} [\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$. So suppose $Z$ is a $\mathcal{W}$-local object. Since $\epsilon : L R \Rightarrow \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{C} [\mathcal{W}^{-1}]}$ is a natural isomorphism, the triangle identities imply $L \eta : L \Rightarrow L R L$ is also a natural isomorphism. In particular, $$\mathcal{C} (\eta_Z, Z) : \mathcal{C} (R L Z, Z) \to \mathcal{C} (Z, Z)$$ is a bijection, so there is a unique morphism $\alpha : R L Z \to Z$ such that $\alpha \circ \eta_Z = \mathrm{id}_Z$. But $L \alpha = \epsilon_{L Z}$, so $$\eta_Z \circ \alpha = R L \alpha \circ \eta_{R L Z} = R \epsilon_{L Z} \circ \eta_{R L Z} = \mathrm{id}_{R L Z}$$ and therefore $\eta_Z : Z \to R L Z$ is indeed an isomorphism. So the conclusion is that $\mathcal{C} [\mathcal{W}^{-1}]$ is equivalent to the full subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$ spanned by the $\mathcal{W}$-local objects. 

On the other hand, if you're asking for category-theoretic formulations of the axiom of choice inside some category of "sets", then there are several: 

Yes, the universe is the classifying space for small homotopy types. For various reasons, the universe is not itself a small homotopy type; so it fails to be an object classifier for the trivial reason that it does not classify itself. Under the univalence axiom, the homotopy type of the universe is well-defined: it is the disjoint union of the classifying spaces $B \mathrm{Aut} (X)$. Note that there is a fibration over $B \mathrm{Aut} (X)$ whose fibres are $X$, such that every fibration with fibres $X$ occurs as a pullback of this fibration in a unique (up to homotopy) way. (This is the Borel construction $E \mathrm{Aut} (X) \times_{\mathrm{Aut} (X)} X$!) The universal fibration is just the disjoint union of these individual fibrations. 

Following Grothendieck, let us say that a category is aspheric if its nerve is weakly contractible and a functor $u : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ is aspheric if for every object $b$ in $\mathcal{B}$, the comma category $(u \downarrow b)$ is aspheric. Question. Consider a pullback diagram in $\mathbf{Cat}$, $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} \mathcal{E} @>{v}>> \mathcal{F} \\ @V{p}VV @VV{q}V \\ \mathcal{A} @>>{u}> \mathcal{B} \end{CD}$$ where $q : \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{B}$ (hence also $p : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{A}$) is a Grothendieck fibration and $u : \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ is aspheric. Is $v : \mathcal{E} \to \mathcal{F}$ also aspheric? 

First, determine the finitely presentable objects in $[\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{C}]$; these will contain e.g. "finitely supported" families of finitely presentable objects. Then, determine the left adjoint of the restriction functor $[\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{C}] \to [\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{C}]$; by general nonsense, the restriction functor is finitely accessible and monadic, and the finitely presentable objects of $[\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{C}]$ will be the objects in the smallest full subcategory that is closed under finite colimits and that contains the free "algebras" generated by the finitely presentable objects in $[\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{C}]$. 

It feels like the free bicartesian closed category generated by the atomic propositions is the most likely candidate, and it can be concretised by the Yoneda embedding into the presheaf topos: then we would have a genuine BHK interpretation, i.e. interpreting a proposition as the ‘set’ of its proofs. This has probably been well-studied, in which case I would appreciate any references to the literature. 

Yes, $\wedge$ is invariant under weak homotopy equivalence in $\mathbf{sSet}_*$. It suffices to show that it sends anodyne extensions (= trivial cofibrations) to weak homtoopy equivalences: indeed, every pointed simplicial set is cofibrant, so by Ken Brown's lemma, any endofunctor on $\mathbf{sSet}_*$ that sends anodyne extensions (= trivial cofibrations) to weak homotopy equivalences must preserve all weak homotopy equivalences. Let $X \vee Y = X \times \{ * \} \cup \{ * \} \times Y \subseteq X \times Y$. It is easy to see that $X \vee (-)$ and $(-) \vee Y$ each preserve anodyne extensions, so $\vee$ is invariant under weak homotopy equivalence. Recall that $X \wedge Y$ is defined by the following pushout diagram in $\mathbf{sSet}_*$: $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} X \vee Y @>>> X \times Y \\ @VVV @VVV \\ \Delta^0 @>>> X \wedge Y \end{CD}$$ Suppose $X_0 \to X_1$ and $Y_0 \to Y_1$ are anodyne extensions. Consider the following diagram in $\mathbf{sSet}_*$, $$\begin{CD} X_0 \vee Y_0 @>>> X_1 \vee Y_1 @>>> X_1 \times Y_1 \\ @VVV @VVV @VVV \\ \Delta^0 @>>> Z_0 @>>> Z_1 \\ & @VVV @VVV \\ && \Delta^0 @>>> X_1 \wedge Y_1 \end{CD}$$ where every square is a pushout square. Since $X_0 \vee Y_0 \to X_1 \vee Y_1$ is an anodyne extension, the same is true of $\Delta^0 \to Z_0$, so $Z_0 \to \Delta^0$ is a weak homotopy equivalence. Moreover, $X_1 \vee Y_1 \to X_1 \times Y_1$ is a monomorphism (= cofibration), so $Z_0 \to Z_1$ is also a monomorphism. Since the model structure on $\mathbf{sSet}_*$ is left proper, it follows that $Z_1 \to X_1 \vee Y_1$ is a weak homotopy equivalence. On the other hand, we also have the following diagram in $\mathbf{sSet}_*$, $$\begin{CD} X_0 \vee Y_0 @>>> X_0 \times Y_0 @>>> X_1 \times Y_1 \\ @VVV @VVV @VVV \\ \Delta^0 @>>> X_0 \wedge Y_0 @>>> Z_1 \end{CD}$$ where both squares are pushout squares, and $X_0 \times Y_0 \to X_1 \times Y_1$ is an anodyne extension (because the model structure on $\mathbf{sSet}$ is cartesian), so $X_0 \wedge Y_0 \to Z_1$ is also an anodyne extension. It is easy to check that the composite $X_0 \wedge Y_0 \to Z_1 \to X_1 \wedge Y_1$ is the morphism obtained by functoriality, so this completes the proof. 

$\mathcal{C}'$ is isomorphic to a functor category, namely the category of functors $\mathbb{B} \mathbb{N} \to \mathcal{C}$, where $\mathbb{B} \mathbb{N}$ is the category freely generated by an endomorphism, i.e. the category with one object $*$ and $\mathrm{Hom}(*, *) = \mathbb{N}$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is an $\mathbf{Ab}$-category and you also require $T^2 = 0$, then $\mathcal{C}'$ is isomorphic to the category of additive functors $\mathbb{B} A \to \mathcal{C}$, where $\mathbb{B} A$ is the $\mathbf{Ab}$-category with just one object $*$ and $\mathrm{Hom}(*, *) = A$, where $A$ is the ring $\mathbb{Z} [T] / (T^2)$. As always, $\mathcal{C}'$ is an $\mathbf{Ab}$-category. 

Clearly, pretopology (1) is contained in pretopology (2). Conversely, given a covering family of type (2), we can obtain a covering family of type (1) by taking a suitable refinement. (For each point $y$ of $Y_i$, take an open neighbourhood $U_{i,j}$ that is mapped homeomorphically into $X$.) So the two pretopologies must generate the same topology. 

As Emil Jeřábek points out, the use of the Keisler–Shelah theorem is overkill. In fact, the conclusion is just a special case of the elementary amalgamation theorem, which is proved by using the compactness theorem. 

There is a Grothendieck topos $\textbf{Set}[\mathbb{O}]$ with the following universal property: for all Grothendieck toposes $\mathcal{E}$, the category $\textbf{Geom}(\mathcal{E}, \textbf{Set}[\mathbb{O}])$ of geometric morphisms $\mathcal{E} \to \textbf{Set}[\mathbb{O}]$ and "geometric transformations" (a misnomer; they actually code algebraic data!) is naturally equivalent to $\mathcal{E}$ itself. Such a $\textbf{Set}[\mathbb{O}]$ is called an object classifier. We can construct $\textbf{Set}[\mathbb{O}]$ explicitly using the theory of classifying toposes: one presentation is as the presheaf topos $[\textbf{FinSet}, \textbf{Set}]$. Indeed, by Diaconescu's theorem, a geometric morphism $\mathcal{E} \to [\textbf{FinSet}, \textbf{Set}]$ is the same thing as a left exact functor $\textbf{FinSet}^\textrm{op} \to \mathcal{E}$, but any such is freely and uniquely determined by the image of $1$; this correspondence extends to 2-morphisms as well. Addendum. To address Simon Henry's comments, here is an abstract construction of $\textbf{Set}[\mathbb{O}]$. It is known that the 2-category of Grothendieck toposes has tensors with small categories. Indeed, $$[\mathbb{C}, \textbf{Geom}(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{F})] \simeq \textbf{Geom}([\mathbb{C}, \mathcal{E}], \mathcal{F})$$ but we know that $\textbf{Set}$ is a pseudo-terminal object in the 2-category of Grothendieck toposes, so we may take $\textbf{Set}[\mathbb{O}] = \textbf{FinSet} \otimes \mathcal{S}$, where $\mathcal{S}$ is any pseudo-terminal Grothendieck topos.
