Give the British Monarchy model a try. You'll like it :-) I live on the leading edge of the empire (first to see the sun) - and disagree with Martin. While the Queen may in theory have little political power, the difference between theory and practice is greater in practice than in theory. The Queen's [tm] power lies in presumed steel fist in many many layers of velvet glove, to the extent that while everyone "knows" that the steel fist is not actually there, in practice it is (even though it's not, even ...) The end result is that the Queen can very easily "lean" on people / organisations / traditions ... and has to (and does) take great care to not to be seen to do any leaning. Reading Winston Churchill's "The Second World War" and other of his writings makes it clear that the then King had substantial influence on Churchill's actions - especially his considered more extreme ones. These mainly related to Churchill's health and safety and likelihood of being alive next week on various occasions, but were not limited to this area. 

Oh yes. They certainly exist. There are some towns like that "somewhat south" of where I live. You've probably heard of them :-). The furthest away is called "South Pole". A some what closer one is called "Mcmurdo". Not too far from Mcmurdo as the Snowcat runs is a town named "Scott Base". THe following gives enough of a feel for the match to the aspects that you mention. If at 1st glance your building description does not seem to fit, have a look at the start of the National Geographic "Megastructures" video. Commuting between South Pole to Mcmurdo by air is either 

Use the normal metabolism. It is unlikely that it would be possible to build up high pressures of CO2 in this way, though, without making the blood too acidic. Use CO2 from her fire breath, if any. This would be highly inefficient, and would again have the problem of generating CO2 at ambient Go to a frozen wasteland and eat CO2 Eat chalk, and use this to generate CO2, through the reaction CaCO3 + Acid = Ca salt + CO2. The acid could come from normal metabolism. As for 4, except the acid comes from an external source. For example, the dragon may go to a volcano and feast on brimstone (sulphur) which she could then burn (producing fiery breath without the inconvenience of having to generate large amounts of fuel through metabolism.) When she is not breathing fire, the dragon may slowly convert the sulphur to SO3 and H2SO4 in her belly, and react these with chalk to make CO2 under pressure. This is an entirely realistic way for a dragon to produce icy breath without metabolism or mechanical engineering issues. The only remaining issue is materials, which have always been a problem with fire-breathing dragons anyway. 

The first three moons are locked in an orbital resonance with each other, which produces enormous tidal forces, which are responsible for heating up the moons, and producing volcanoes and other phenomena. There is therefore a rich source of geothermal energy on these moons, without the need for solar cells which would be very ineffective this far from the sun, (or nuclear technology, which is probably a requirement for extensive space travel, but should perhaps be conserved for when it is most needed.) Delta v's for transfer between Jupiter's various moons are very reasonable, see the bottom right corner of $URL$ 

The parts in brackets are my additions. Although the story is stated to take place in England (albeit before the invention of football), the use of "field" instead of "pitch" leads me to believe ArtOfCode is referring to an American sportsball football field, whose area I've inserted. I also added a distance restriction (the length of a football field) in keeping with the intent of not allowing armchair spellcasters. Rule Issues 

In summary: in higher gravity, humanoids must be smaller or they won't be able to support their own weight. However, smaller creatures cannot have complex enough nervous systems to be intelligent. The first part of the answer involves the gravity of a planet. According to Newton's law of Gravitation the gravitational force on a object is: $$ F=G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $$ Ignoring the factor of $G$, the gravitational acceleration (force over mass) is just proportional to the mass of the planet $M$ and the radius of the planet $R$ (for an object at the surface, distance is equal to radius): $$ g\propto \frac M{R^2} $$ The mass of a planet, assuming the density remains constant, is proportional to volume, which is proportional to radius cubed: $$ M=\rho V\propto R^3 $$ So we find that the surface gravity of a planet is proportional to the radius: $$ g\propto\frac{R^3}{R^2}\propto R $$ So if you double the size of the planet, the gravity also doubles. The second part of the question involves living organisms. The shape of an organism is related to its size due to something we call the square-cube law. Essentially, the strength is proportional to area (size squared) but weight is proportional to volume (size cubed). This is why a person could not simply be scaled to gigantic size, they would need to become thicker (as you pointed out). As the ratio of weight to strength changes, structures must become change shape. As the ratio increases (more weight) structures must become thicker (e.g. an elephant); as the ratio decreases (less weight) structures can become more spindly (e.g. a fly). Note that most specific shapes occur at a specific range of this ratio, i.e. a specific size: there are no upright-walking humanoids much larger or smaller than humans. For a given density, the weight is also proportional to gravity, so the ratio is proportional to gravity and size: $$ \frac WF\propto \frac{gl^3}{l^2}\propto gl $$ This means that to maintain the same ratio, and therefore the same (humanoid) shape, a creature must become smaller as the gravity increases. Therefore, the size of creature that will evolve a humanoid shape is inversely proportional to planet size. So on a planet twice the size of the Earth, you would have 1 m/3 ft humanoids. There are size limits: smaller humanoids may not have complex enough brains to be sentient, so the gravity can't increase without limit. If you regard children or dwarves as fairly close to the minimum size/complexity, then we're looking for around 1 m/3 ft creatures. At around half the size of average humans, a 1 m/3 ft humanoid could evolve on a double gravity/double size planet. This is a very, very rough estimate, so the absolute limit could be higher (maybe 4 or 5 g). 

Firstly, Lerite sounds like a mineral, not an element, so I think if you are going to invent an element you should give it a more appropriate name. Some elements have more than one name (columbium is now called niobium for example) so it could be an existing element. Dysprosium (element 66) has been mentioned in another answer, but I don't see it as particularly significant. All the Lanthanide series are quite rare, but Samarium (element 62) is used in powerful samarium cobalt magnets. If you're looking for an element with weird properties, try Technetium, element 43. Despite its fairly low atomic number, it has no stable isotopes so it must always be prepared from other elements and is highly radioactive. Similar levels of instability aren't seen again until you get past Lead (element 82.) You could handwave a stable form of technetium, I suppose, though it's not physically possible. The other possiblility is a compound or composite. If you want to call it lerite, it could be a mineral like Superman's kryptonite. There are many minerals formed of very mundane elements that have very distinctive properties: lapis lazuli / lazurite, opals, zeolites, and asbestos to name a few. If you want to invent something new that is magnetic, it could be an organic compound, either synthesized by humans or other inteligent life, or by biological processes. for example you can have "plastic magnets". There are microbes that swim in a certain direction according to magnetic fields, and no-one knows how they do it.

Available energy: Start with an energy input of about 2000 kilo calories per day for a semi sedentary person. 1 cal ~= 4.2 watt-second = 4.2 Joule. 2000 kCal = 2000 x 1000 x 4.2 J ~= 8.4 MJ/day. 1 kWh = 1000 W x 3600 seconds = 3.6 MJ. So TOTAL food energy for average person ~~~= 2.333 kWh . At (unobtainable) 100% efficiency that's about $0.60 of electricity at 25c/unit. If you can extract 10% of total energy from user that's ~=1/4 kWh or 6c of electricity equivalent./day. More food = more energy and probably a greater % out but still small. Sanity check: I could pedal an exercycle for say 15 hours/day at 50 Watts if my life depended on it. 50 Watts is a very easy pedalling rate against a light but noticeable load. After an hour os so I'd find it annoying (some wouldn't). After 15 hours I'd be exhausted but it should be maintainable given enough food and fitness. That's 50W x 15 hours x 3600 sec/hour = 2.7 MJ. My food requirement would rise - I'd expect to 3000-4000 kCal/day or say 12-16 Mj/day range. I could maybe do 100 Watts for an hour and be "rather tired". Once I could do 500 Watts for about 10 seconds and then needed a good lie down :-). To fly the English Channel under your own power takes 300-500 Watts for as long as it takes. That makes the mechanical output about say 15-20% efficient. Not bad. On the level on a bicycle I'd expect 50 Watts continuous to give me say 4 to 5 kilometres per hour so that would take me about 60 to 75 km in a day :-) Any hills would greatly reduce that. Leg muscles, heart etc could probably be run semi indefinitely (given enough food input and suitable plumbing) at say 100 Watts, so about triple my 100 Watts x 15 hours results. Energy sources: Despite what people say here, I've long been impressed at how much work you can get from a human body on a kg or so of semi random carbohydrates. If you used solar heated ponds to grow "** Cyano-bacteria aka blue- green algae aka 'pond scum"** you may [tm] be able to run the energy production system on the output. Each person-unit is only running at 100 Watts say but 24 hours / day so that's equivalent to eg a solar panel's 4hrs mean sun/day year round in most areas. So a 100W person gives the same daily energy as a 600 Watt PV panel which has an area of about 4 square meters at current module delivered efficiencies of say 15%. A panel does not need algal fuel - but a person unit can probably fit in one square meter and can be stacked N high, unlike panels which must "see" the sun directly. Persons have to be plumbed (algal matter and water in, waste products out). The algal ponds take extra area - probably in excess of the PV panel area needs. Overall it may depend on available resources - but PV panels sound like an easier task :-). 

The sky straight overhead. Even accounting for seeing (atmospheric turbulence) we have an almost totally unimpaired view of the stars at night through the couple of km of air overhead. Satellites also have no trouble looking back down at the Earth. From this perspective the atmosphere is optically thin. The horizon. Looking at the ocean you can barely see a slight curvature. More importantly, objects passing over the horizon (ships and distant land) appear distorted from atmospheric refection and washed-out from scattering. However, although the Sun is dimmed enough to become viewable by the naked eye at sunset, it is still clearly visible. The atmosphere is not optically thick when viewed edge-on. 

Then you're in luck! Your "planet" could be a white dwarf star, an ultra-dense ball of electron-degenerate matter. No fusion occurs in a white dwarf: its radiative output comes entirely from stored thermal energy. The radius of a white dwarf of $1~M_\text{Sun}$ is around $0.008~R_\text{Sun}$. The surface gravity of such a star "planet" would be around $400\,000~g$, and the surface temperature would be $1000~\text{K}$ to $10\,000~\text{K}$, depending on age. 

We can plug in these values and we get: $$ \dot M\approx 1.5\cdot 10^{15}~\text{t}/\text{s} $$ Yes, we need to move over a million billion tons of air per second to keep the city afloat, or enough to turn over the whole atmosphere in around three seconds. Now, this is obviously not going to be laminar flow anymore; we can calculate the air velocity at the edge of the city, assuming a diameter of $2R=45~\text{km}$: $$ v = \frac{b^2\sigma g}{\mu R} = 20\cdot 10^{6}~\text{km}/\text{s} $$ This is obviously wrong, since it's 60 times greater than the speed of light. However, it does tell us that we can't levitate the city this way. We can try another approximation, this time using actuator disk theory. It tells us that the amount of power required for the city to hover is given by: $$ P \approx A\sqrt{\frac{\left(\sigma g\right)^3}{2\rho}} $$ Using the same values as before, we come up with a power of: $$ P \approx 1000~\text{TW} $$ ... which is 50 to 100 times current global energy consumption. Even if we could circumvent these issues, we'd still have to apply a couple of psi to the ground below to support the weight of the city. This would certainly flatten any fields that city flies over, and if the force is applied in even a slightly unstructured way, this could easily flatten buildings. In addition, the ground itself could give way when you fly over another city: imagine doubling the weight of every building, and the settling that would occur. Hydrostatic Levitation We can get around the ground pressure problems by replacing the weight of the air that's already there; that is, floating the city with balloons. As a best-case scenario, I'll assume that the balloons are filled with vacuum. To see how this works, imagine cutting out a disk-shaped slab of air and replacing it with a rigid shell. If the total weight of the shell is equal to the weight of the air removed, the forces on the surrounding air will be exactly the same, and the people on the ground won't feel any pressure. I'll use the same figures as before for our calculation: a base height of $1000~\text{ft}$ and an average mass of $1000~\text{kg}/\text{m}^2$ (around $1.4~\text{psi}$, or $0.1~\text{atm}$). We can set up the following equation relating the mass of a section of the city and the mass of the air it displaces: $$ m = \int \rho\ dV \\ \sigma A = \int \rho\ dz\ dA \\ \sigma = \int_{b}^{b+\Delta z}\rho\ dz $$ Using the US standard atmosphere, I get a value $\Delta z = 2900~\text{ft}$. If we using a lifting gas with density relative to air $\tilde\rho$, the equation becomes: $$ \sigma = (1-\tilde\rho)\int_{b}^{b+\Delta z}\rho\ dz $$ For helium with $\tilde\rho=14~\%$, we get $\Delta z = 3400~\text{ft}$. Of course, this is only enough to keep you $1000~\text{ft}$ above sea level. If you want to float above the tallest building in the mile-high city (or get from one side of the US to the other) you need to have $\Delta z = 4000~\text{ft}$ high balloons. Psuedoscience (Aside) It looks like we need to ignore hard-science if we want to make this work. Personally I would have your city levitated with a variant of a reactionless drive. The common spaceborne sci-fi variant pushes on a gravitational well, so that momentum is conserved but no reaction mass is expended. If this is possible, it may also be possible to "latch on" directly to the gravity well of a planet. It would essentially be a floating solid foundation (although it would experience tidal motion due to the influence of the Sun and Moon). The energy requirements would be zero until the city moves, and when it does the required power can be made as small as desired by reducing speed (although the total amount of energy required to lift the city a given height is fixed by its weight). Generic Problems Whatever method you use, there are two more problems that I can foresee. First, your city will be a giant moving eclipse. Nobody wants an airship the size of Guam floating over their heads, even if it's just for a day: not cities, where there are lots of people to get angry; and certainly not in rural areas, where crops could be harmed by the lack of sunlight. Environmentalists will protest the disruption to the local ecosystem wherever you go. Second, wind speeds increase rapidly with altitude, and temperature and pressure decrease; not to mention that low clouds would pass through the city like dense fog. Inhabitants of a floating city would experience worse weather than ground-dwellers at pretty much all times. Thirdly, the city would likely be subject to electrostatic charging by the same mechanism that causes clouds to become charged. At the very best, the city itself would act as a lightning conduit during storms. At the worst, the city itself might generate a few small lightning strikes when first passing over a tall building. (Yet another reason to refuse passage to this power-hungry/regular-hungry darkness-bringer of a city.) 

There are salt flat regions near the Nile itself. Perhaps the largest is the Qattara Depression. The great bitter lake, now flooded with seawater as part of the Suez Canal, was once a salt flat. During the building of the Suez Canal, a small parallel canal called the Sweetwater Canal was built to supply fresh water to the area. The water came from the Nile via Lake Timsah. 

You seem to be assuming that an intelligent organism would have to be a vertebrate. It wouldn't. The requirements for intelligence are a reasonable size to accomodate a big brain, social behaviour, and an ability to use tools. From an anatomical point of view it's unsurprising that (despite the relative lack of social behaviour) the most intelligent invertebrate is the octopus. It needs intelligence to make the best use of all those limbs. Octopi have been shown to learn by demonstration as well as experience (An octopus who watches another octopus solve a puzzle, such as getting food out of a screw top container, is able to solve the puzzle itself.) The main thing holding octopus civilization back is that their reproductive cycle means they never knowingly have contact with their offspring, and therefore have no incentive to care for them. An octopus that evolved live births would probably soon evolve good care of its offspring and a rich culture quite quickly afterwards. Holding back octopus technology is their rather stable environment. They have no need for shelter, as warm blooded humans in a cold climate do. On the other hand, if they start going to war, they will need weapons and castles. I imagine them forming a society like the Greek philosophers, with major advances in maths, and maybe less so in technology. Still it would be interesting to see what technologies they came up with, and that could be the subject of another question. 

Of the two bombers you mention, one is fuel-injected and the other is carbureted. Neither of them use sensitive electronics (the first fly-by-wire/ECM system appeared in the Concorde in the late 60s). To see how much protection they need, let's look at some real-world examples of EMPs. These guys have developed a car-stopping EMP 'gun' that, at first, seems to operate like you describe. However, the video neglects to show you the (undoubtedly large) capacitor bank used to power the EMP. They also pull the car up to point-blank range, suggesting that the impressive-looking helical antenna isn't able to focus the broadband pulse (they certainly have no qualms about firing it out towards the parking lot!). Lastly, they mention that they are disabling the car's microprocessors, which is not a feat, since without their protective circuitry, complex integrated circuits can be destroyed by accidental static discharges far too small to feel. Also note that their claimed timeframe is five years: but it's 2015 and no one's using EMP cannons on cars. This video shows another example of disabling a car with an EMP. The important thing to notice is that the electric windows still work. The alternator, starter motor, and spark plugs are built to handle far more current than the window motor, so they are undoubtedly still working too. The reason the car doesn't start is most likely that the computer is damaged. An engine without a computer (see 1960s planes, above) would be undamaged. Even if your EMPs are powerful enough to cause damage to an unprotected alternator, shielding such a small target is relatively simple. The only other target is the spark plugs (the starter could be external to the plane), which are already well-protected due to their placement between the head and valve covers, which form a very thick shell. All the other parts can be mechanical, and in fact on WWII bombers like the ones you mention (developed in the 30s and 40s), they were! If powerful, long-range EMPs were developed in the 60s, likely the only change the Air Force would have to make is to switch from the B-29 (which used, among other things, electronic fire control) back to the B-17. Finally, unless your EMP fighters are equipped with some really, really heavy shielding, they're going to fry themselves when they fire. Since they're closer to the focal point of the pulse, their shielding requirements scale faster than the defender's requirements, meaning that an offensive, non-kamikaze EMP is wholly impractical.
