I wish to add an $\epsilon$ to the previous answer. Assume that your symplectic manifold is $T^*M$, where $M$ is a closed manifold, and consider a so called ``Tonelli Hamiltonian´´ $H:T^*M\rightarrow\mathbb R$, which is simply a function which is fiberwise (differentiably) convex and superlinear. Then consider the value $$ c(H)=\min_{u\in C^\infty(M;\mathbb R)} \max_{q\in M} H(q,du_q). $$ This special number in the literature is called ``Mañé critical value´´. Now, if you fix an energy value $h > C(H)$, you can easily build a new Hamiltonian $G$ such that 1) $H^{-1}(h)=G^{-1}(h')$ for some $h'\in\mathbb R$ 2) $G(q,\lambda p)=\lambda^2 G(q,p)$ for each $\lambda>0$ 3) $G$ is fiberwise convex Now, the Legendre dual of the Hamiltonian $G$ will be a Finsler metric (not Riemannian in general). The interesting thing here is that the critical value $c(H)$ can be defined in many other equivalent ways (in terms of Lagrangian action of closed loops, in terms of minimizing invariant measures, etc.). You can find more on this in the book by Contreras and Iturriaga: $URL$ 

Is there any obstruction that prevents a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on some symplectic manifold to be realized as the time-one map of the Hamiltonian flow of an autonomous Hamiltonian? In the same spirit, is there any obstruction that prevents a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on $T^*M$ (with the canonical symplectic structure) to be realized as the time-one map of the Hamiltonian flow of a Tonelli Hamiltonian (i.e. a Hamiltonian which is fiberwise convex and superlinear)? 

Given a smooth function $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb R$ on a manifold, its local homology at a critical point $x$ is the group $$ C_\star(x) := H_\star ( M_{ < c} \cup \{ x \} , M_{ < c} ) ,$$ where $H_\star$ denotes singular homology (with any coefficient group), $c=f(x)$, and $M_{ < c}$ is the space of those points $x\in M$ such that $f(x) < c$. If $x$ is a non-degenerate critical point, then $C_\star(x)$ is completely determined by the Morse index of $f$ at $x$: the group $C_j(x)$ is equal to the coefficient group of the homology for $j=\mathrm{ind} (x)$, and is trivial for other values of $j$. If $x$ is degenerate, the knowledge of $\mathrm{ind}(x)$ and $\mathrm{nul}(x)$ (this latter being the nullity of $f$ at $x$) is not enough to determine $C_\star (x)$. It is easy to build examples of functions on $\mathbb R^2$ having a critical point $x$ with local homology $C_1(x)= G\oplus ...\oplus G$ ($k$ times, where $k>1$ and $G$ is the coefficient group) and $C_j(x)=0$ for $j\neq 1$. For instance, consider the function $f:\mathbb R^2\rightarrow\mathbb R$ given by $$ f(x,y)=(y-2x^2)(y-x^2)(y+x^2)(y+2x^2). $$ Here, the origin is a critical point whose local homology (say, with $\mathbb Z_2$ coefficients) should be $C_1(0)=\mathbb Z_2\oplus\mathbb Z_2\oplus \mathbb Z_2$ and $C_j(0)=0$ for $j\neq 1$. Does anybody know examples of functions having critical points whose local homology is nonzero in more then one degree? If the answer to the previous question is yes (as I would expect), is it true that given $(n_1,d_1), ..., (n_r,d_r)$ there exists a function $f:M\rightarrow\mathbb R$ with a critical point $x$ whose local homology is given by $C_{d_j}(x)=G^{ \oplus n_j }$ and $C_d(x)=0$ for $d\neq d_1,...,d_r$? 

Edit: I now realize this is pretty much the same thing that Alberto said in the comments above. Remember that closed points of a stack $X$ correspond to the $Spec(K)$-valued points of $X$ where $K$ is an algebraically closed field. In Laumon-Moret-Bailley, they define the points of the stack to be all of the field-valued points of $X$ (including the non-algebraically closed fields). Hence specialization and generization still make sense in this context. 

Ben gave the general answer above. If you care specifically about the symplectic group and are interested in a "flag-like" description of its flag variety, then one exists. It is given by all half-flags of isotropic subspaces (this is just like for $SL_n$, the symplectic group acts transitively and the stabilizer of the standard half-flag will be the standard Borel). With this description, it's just as straightforward computing Springer fibers and the like as it is for the $SL_n$ case, which you're presumably familiar with. A reference for these flag-like descriptions can be found in the section of Fulton and Harris on "Homogeneous Spaces" (there's a similar description for the special orthogonal groups). 

The Dynkin diagram enter as follows. Each of these surfaces can be resolved through a finite number of blow-ups, and the exceptional fiber in the resolution will consist of a copy of $\mathbb{P}^1$ for each node of the Dynkin diagram, each of which is joined to the point of another $\mathbb{P}^1$ if there is a corresponding edge in the Dynkin diagram connecting the two nodes (so in the cyclic case, it's just a chain of $\mathbb{P}^1$'s). Lastly, there is a neat connection between this and Springer theory that goes as follows. Let $\mathcal{N}$ denote the nilpotent cone of a Lie algebra of one of the types listed above, and let $\mathcal{O}$ denote the subregular orbit. Then $\mathcal{O}$ has codimension two in $\mathcal{N}$ and hence the corresponding Kostant/Slodowy slice is a surface in $\mathcal{N}.$ It then turns out that this surface is one of the surface singularities listed above, and that the corresponding Springer fiber of a subregular element is isomorphic to the exceptional fiber in the resolution of the surface mentioned above. So the Springer resolution encodes the information of the successive blow-ups of these surfaces. A few good references: Milnor, Singular Points of Complex Hypersurfaces Dimca, Singularities and Topology of Hypersurfaces Slodowy, Simple Singularities and Simple Algebraic Groups 

One approach to this is to track the number $N_0(M(t))$ of zero-columns or the number $N(M(t))$ of rows $r$, s.t. $r$ contains the first row of $M(1)$ in its linear decomposition. These numbers follow the Markov property, and one can construct corresponding linear Markov chains with $n+1$ states to find their long-term behavior and bound $$\mbox{rank } M(T) \leq n-N_0(M(T)) \\ E[\mbox{rank } M(T)] \leq n \Pr[N(M(T))>0] $$ Although the bounds are tight for $k=1$, they are very loose for $k>1, T\gg n$. In fact for $k=1$ the rank drops to $1$ rather quickly in $T = O(n^2)$, but for $k>1$, the decay seems to be exponentially slow, e.g. $E[\mbox{rank } M_3(10^5)]\approx E[\mbox{rank } M_3(10^7)] \approx 5$ for $n=20$ (numerically). Another numerical observation shows that for $n\ge 10$ the resulting $E[\mbox{rank } M(T)]$ does not depend much on the field size once it is prime and larger than $7$. Any reference to studying the long products like $M(t)$ of random permutations with a fixed matrix $S$ would be also appreciated. 

This question originates from an engineering problem, which I am solving. Any related references are highly appreciated. Let $M_k(T)=\prod_{t=1}^T P_t S_k$ over some field (finite or reals), where $P_t$ is a random (uniform, i.i.d. over $t$) $n\times n$ permutation matrix, and $S_k$ is a fixed idempotent matrix of rank $n-1$ of the following form $$ S_1=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \cdots \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \cdots \\ 0 & 0 & \\ \vdots & \vdots & \huge{I_{n-2}} \\ 0 & 0 & \end{pmatrix}, S_2=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 &0 & 0 \cdots \\ 0 & 1 &0& 0 \cdots \\ 1 & 1 &0& 0 \cdots \\ 0 & 0 &0& \\ \vdots &\vdots & \vdots & \huge{I_{n-3}} \\ 0 & 0 &0& \end{pmatrix}, \\ S_k=\begin{pmatrix} & &&0 & \\ & \huge{I_k} &&\vdots& \huge{0} \\ & &&0& \\ 1 & \cdots &1&0& 0 \cdots \\ & & &0& \\ & \huge{0}& & \vdots & \huge{I_{n-k-1}} \\ &&&0& \end{pmatrix}.$$ Essentially, each additional multiplication by $P_t S_k$ replaces some row of $M_k(t-1)$ with a linear combination of $k$ other rows. It is not hard to see that $\mbox{rank } M_k(t)$ is non-increasing in $t$, and $\lim_{T\to \infty} \mbox{rank } M_k(T) \leq k$ almost surely. I am looking into the rate of this convergence. 

I'm not sure exactly what question you're asking. I think you may be looking for the following answer. By the decomposition theorem, the intersection cohomology of the variety is a direct summand of the cohomology of the resolution. I'm not sure there's anything more specific you can say than that in general. 

This is exactly Proposition 3.1(a) in Chapter IV of Hartshorne. The proof, in my opinion, provides a good explanation of why the result is true. 

This is merely too long to be a comment. I'm not sure that I completely agree with or understand the basis of the question. Is this one of those questions where the OP is taking for granted that varieties are interesting and then wondering what schemes are useful for in this context? If so, there have certainly been other questions of this sort on mathoverflow. However, I get the feeling this is not what's being asked for, in which case I'm not sure that the example of character theory being used to solve a problem of group theory is completely analogous. In that example, groups are already inherently part of character theory, so it seems reasonable that problems of group theory might be attacked using character theory. When asking a similar question about schemes, I'm not sure what the starting point is. To me, asking what you can do with schemes is more like asking 'what can you do with groups?' than 'what can you do with characters?'. At this point, I would say that both groups and schemes are naturally occurring basic mathematical objects that are of great interest to many mathematicians. 

You can use connectedness to prove that $\mathbb{R}$ is not homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ for any n>1 by noting that $\mathbb{R} \backslash 0$ is not connected while $\mathbb{R}^n \backslash 0$ is connected. The students may not be very impressed by this as it is telling them something they probably already assumed was true. I suppose that if you wanted them to discover cohomology, you could challenge them to find a reason why Euclidean spaces of different dimensions are never homeomorphic (I realize that this probably isn't very reasonable).
