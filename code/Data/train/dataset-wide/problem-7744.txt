The parametrization \eqref{2} can be deduced, quite laboriously, using Weierstrass elliptic functions and the product expansion for $\Delta$. However, when we clear the denominators, equation \eqref{1} (possibly) becomes an identity between modular forms and such identities should be easy to prove using the fact, that the space of modular forms has a finite dimension. Can this be done? What can we say about $\Delta(2\tau)$? It is a modular form with respect to some group? 

There is a matrix $M$ with determinant $m$ fixing $z$. We can find $\lambda\in\mathcal O_D$ such that the norm $N(\lambda)=m$. 

I have a question which is fairly elementary, but first I must provide relevant context. Without it, my question would seem rather arbitrary and scarcely interesting. Note also that my question can be answered without reading what follows. Let $j(\omega)$ be the modular invariant, $\Gamma$ be the modular group and $H$ the upper half-plane. Define $\gamma_2(\omega)=\sqrt[3]{j(\omega)}$ using the cube root which is real on the imaginary axis. Let $\tau\in H$ satisfy \begin{equation} A\tau^2+B\tau+C=0,\ (A,B,C)=1. \end{equation} By Class field theory the value $j(\tau)$ is an algebraic integer of degree exactly $h(D)$, where $D=B^2-4AC$. Since $\gamma_2(\tau)^3-j(\tau)=0$ one would expect the degree of $\gamma_2(\tau)$ to be $3h(D)$. But it turns out that, if $(A,3)=1$ and $3\mid B$, the degree of $\gamma_2(\tau)$ is also $h(D)$. Now I indicate how this result can be proved. Set $\varepsilon=e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{3}}$. It can be shown that for $\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ we have \begin{equation} \gamma_2{\left(\frac{a\omega+b}{c\omega+d}\right)}=\varepsilon^{ab-ac+cd-a^2cd}\gamma_2(\omega). \end{equation} This implies that $\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\tau)$ if and only if $A\omega=\tau$, with $A=\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ satisfying $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$, except when $\omega \equiv e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{3}} \ (\textrm{mod}\ \Gamma)$, in which case $\gamma_2(\omega)=0$. Next define \begin{equation} S(n,3)=\bigg\lbrace\begin{pmatrix} r & s\\ 0 & t \end{pmatrix}:rt=n,r>0,(r,s,t)=1,3\mid s,0\leq s <3t \bigg\rbrace. \end{equation} Let $\omega$ be in the upper half-plane $H$. Consider the polynomial \begin{equation} \phi_{n,\omega}(x)=\prod_{M\in S(n,3)}\left(x-\gamma_2(M\omega)\gamma_2(\omega)^{-n} \right). \end{equation} It takes some work to show that the coefficients of this polynomial are invariant under $\Gamma$, and therefore rational functions in $j(\omega)$. After additional work we conclude that they are in fact polynomials with integral coefficients. In this way we get a polynomial $\Phi_n(x,y)\in \mathbb Z[x,y]$ such that $\Phi_n(x,j(\omega))=\phi_{n,\omega}(x)$. Applying a suitable substitution we obtain another polynomial $\Psi_n(x,y)\in \mathbb Z[x,y]$ satisfying for all $0\neq z \in \mathbb C$ 

The space of observables is typically not compact when $|F| > 1$. For example, if $|F| = 2$ and $X$ is a nonatomic probability space then the space of observables can be identified with the measure algebra of $X$. Futhermore, any two nonatomic standard probability spaces are isomorphic and hence under this assumption on $X$ the space of observables depends only on the cardinality of $F$. 

Let $\lambda( \cdot )$ denote Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$. Let $(A_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ be a decreasing sequence of Borel subsets of $[0,1]$ such that $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty A_n = \emptyset$. Given $\epsilon > 0$ does there exist an open set $U \subseteq [0,1]$ such that (i) $\lambda(A_n \setminus U) = 0$ for some $n$, (ii) $\lambda(U) \leq \epsilon$, and (iii) $\lambda(\partial U) = 0$, where $\partial U$ is the boundary of $U$? I don't have a good intuition whether this should be true or not. One idea might be to cover some $A_n$ by an open set with measure much smaller than $\epsilon$, then hope that we can expand that open set somewhat to make its boundary null. 

Given an injective linear map $T$ between Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$, let \begin{equation} d(T) = \sup \left \{ \frac{||x||_X}{||Tx||_Y}: x \in X \mbox{ is nonzero } \right\} \cdot ||T||_{\mathrm{op}} \end{equation} Let \begin{equation} c(X,Y) = \inf \Bigl\{ d(T): T \mbox{ is an injective linear map from } X \mbox{ to }Y \Bigr \}. \end{equation} Let $\ell^p_n$ be $\mathbb{R}^n$ with the $p$-norm and let $\mathcal{H}$ be an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. I would like to know if $c(\ell^1_n,\mathcal{H}) = O((\log n)^k)$ for some $k$. Alternatively, is it the case that $c(\ell^p_n,\mathcal{H}) = O_p((\log n)^{k(p)})$ for every $p > 1$? There is a lot of literature about the Banach-Mazur distance but I have been unable to find information about linear embeddings (rather than isomorphisms). On the other hand, there is a well known result of Bourgain which asserts that a metric space with $n$ points can be embedded in $\mathcal{H}$ with distortion $O(\log n)$, but I don't know if this can be done in a uniform linear way. 

Let $\epsilon > 0$. I would like to know if there exists $c < \infty$ such that for all $d \in \mathbb{N}$ the following holds. If $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ let $N_x$ be the standard Gaussian centered at $x$. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the subspace of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ spanned by the vectors $\{N_x: x \in \mathbb{Z}^d,||x||_2 \geq c\}$. Then the $L^2$ norm of the orthogonal projection of $N_0$ onto $\mathcal{V}$ is less than $\epsilon$. I am also interested in the version of this question where the functions $N_x$ are the normalized indicators of balls of radius $\sqrt{d}$. An idea that might be useful is as follows. In order to obtain the desired bound, it suffices to bound the norm of the projection onto the closed span $\mathcal{W}$ of $\{N_x :x \in \mathbb{R}^d,||x||_2 \geq c \}$. Since both $N_0$ and $\mathcal{W}$ are rotation-invariant, the projection of $N_0$ onto $\mathcal{W}$ must be rotation-invariant. Intuitively, this suggests that the projection should be a positive scalar multiple of $f = \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} u \cdot N_{\overline{x}} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u)$ where $\sigma$ is the Haar measure on the orthogonal group $\mathrm{O}(d)$ and $\overline{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is any fixed point with $||\overline{x}||_2 = c$. Now, $\langle N_0,f \rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) f(x) \, \mathrm{d}x = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) \left( \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} u \cdot N_{\overline{x}} \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u) \right)(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \\ \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x)( u \cdot N_{\overline{x}})(x)\, \mathrm{d}x \, \mathrm{d} \sigma(u) \\ = \int_{\mathrm{O}(d)} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} (u \cdot N_0)(x) N_{\overline{x}}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \,\mathrm{d}\sigma(u) \\ = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} N_0(x) N_{\overline{x}}(x) \, \mathrm{d}x \leq \delta(c)$ where $\delta:[0,\infty) \to [0,\infty)$ is a function independent of $d$ with $\lim_{c \to \infty} \delta(c) = 0$. Let $p$ be the projection of $N_0$ on $\mathcal{W}$ and let $\alpha > 0$ be such that $p = \alpha f$. We have $||p||^2 = \langle N_0,p \rangle = \langle N_0,\alpha f \rangle \leq \alpha \delta(c)$. Since $||p||_2 \leq 1$, we have $\alpha \leq 1/||f||_2$. Thus one would need to show that $||f||_2 > \beta$ for some absolute constant $\beta > 0$, as well as confirming the hypothesis about $f$. 

Let $\Gamma$ be the modular group and $\mathcal M_n$ the set of all primitive matrices with determinant $n\geq1$. Recall that a primitive matrix has relatively prime entries. The modular group $\Gamma$ acts on the set $\mathcal M _n$ from the left. The representatives of the orbits of this action can be chosen as $$S(n)=\bigg \lbrace \begin{pmatrix}r &s\\0&t\end{pmatrix}:r>0,rt=n,(r,s,t)=1,0\leq s<t\bigg\rbrace.$$ One encounters this, for example, when studying the modular equation $\Phi_n(X,X)$. Cf. Zagier, p. 68. Now consider a generalization of $S(n)$, namely $$\mathcal{S}\left(n,d\right)=\bigg\lbrace \begin{pmatrix}r &s\\0&t\end{pmatrix}: r>0,rt=n,(r,t,s)=1,d \mid s, 0 \leq s < dt\bigg\rbrace.$$ These sets arise from the study of modular functions for certain subgroups of $\Gamma$ and their transformation equations. My question is this: is there some set of matrices $\mathcal M_{n,d}$ and a subgroup $\Gamma_{n,d}\subset\Gamma$ such that $S(n,d)$ is a set of representatives for the orbits of the left action $\Gamma_{n,d}\backslash\mathcal M_n$? 

Thus if $0\neq z \in \mathbb C$ is a root of $\Psi_n(x,x)=0$ then we must have for some $\omega$ and $M=\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} r & s \\ 0 & t \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in S(n,3)$ \begin{equation} z=\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(M\omega) \end{equation} and consequently by the fourth paragraph \begin{equation} \frac{a\omega+b}{c\omega+d}=\frac{r\omega+s}{t} \end{equation} where $a,b,c,d$ are integers such that $ad-bc=1$ and $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$. Hence $\omega$ is a root of a quadratic equation with integral coefficients, and if $n$ is suitably chosen, then the middle coefficient will be divisible by $3$. Conversely if we can find $\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)$ and $\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix} r & s \\ 0 & t \end{smallmatrix} \bigr) $ with these properties, $\gamma_2(\omega)$ will be a root of $\Psi_n(x,x)=0$ On the other hand the roots of the equation \begin{equation} x^3-j(\omega)=0 \end{equation} are \begin{equation} \gamma_2(\omega),\ e^{-2\pi i/3}\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\omega+1),\ e^{2\pi i/3}\gamma_2(\omega)=\gamma_2(\omega-1) \end{equation} If we could guarantee that the only common root of $\Psi_n(x,x)$ and $x^3-j(\omega)$ is $\gamma_2(\omega)$, then we would know that $\gamma_2(\omega)$ and $j(\omega)$ had the same degree. But if $A$ is not divisible by $3$, $B$ is divisible by $3$ and \begin{equation} A\omega^2+B\omega+C=0,\ (A,B,C)=1. \end{equation} then it is easy to see that the numbers $\omega + 1$ and $\omega -1$ satisfy quadratic equations whose middle coefficients are not divisible by $3$. Therefore $\gamma_2(\omega)$ is the only common root and we are done. Finally, my question is this: given $\omega\in H$ such that $\omega^2+3\omega+\frac{9-D}{4}=0$ where $D\equiv 5 \ (\textrm{mod} \ 8)$ and $D<0$ is not divisible by 3, how can I find $n\equiv -1 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$ and $M\in S(n,3)$ such that $$A\omega=M\omega$$ holds for some $A=\bigl( \begin{smallmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{smallmatrix} \bigr)\in\Gamma$ satisfying $ab-ac+cd-a^2cd \equiv 0 \ (\textrm{mod}\ 3)$? 

Let $T$ be a measure preserving transformation of a standard probability space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$. A partition $\alpha$ of $X$ is said to be a generator for $T$ if the smallest $T$ invariant $\sigma$-algebra of measurable sets containing the pieces of $\alpha$ is all of $\mathcal{B}$. Suppose there is a generator $\alpha$ for $T$ and a finite set $F \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$ such that $\alpha$ is measurable with respect to $\bigvee_{n \in F} T^n \alpha$. Does this imply that $T$ has zero entropy? 

If $A$ and $B$ are $C^*$ algebras I will write $A \overline{\otimes} B$ for the maximal tensor product and $A \underline{\otimes} B$ for the minimal tensor product. If $G$ is a countable discrete group I will write $C^*(G)$ for the full group $C^*$ algebra of $G$. Let also $\mathbb{F}_\infty$ be the free group on a countably infinite set of generators. A theorem of Kirchberg asserts that Connes' embedding conjecture is equivalent to the statement $C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) \overline{\otimes} C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) = C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) \underline{\otimes} C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty)$. I would like to find out what is known about the statement that $C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) \overline{\otimes} C^*(G) = C^*(\mathbb{F}_\infty) \underline{\otimes} C^*(G)$ for every countable discrete group $G$. Are there counterexamples to this stronger statement, or alternatively is it equivalent to the original conjecture? 

It is well known that if $T$ is a nonsingular transformation of a standard probability space $(X,\mu)$ and there exists an ergodic measure preserving transformation $S$ of $(X,\mu)$ such that $T$ commutes with $S$, then $T$ is measure preserving. I would like to know of there is an approximate version of this fact. More explicitly, let $T$ be a nonsingular transformation of $(X,\mu)$ and suppose that for some small $\epsilon$ there exists an ergodic nonsingular tranformation $S$ which commutes with $T$ and such that there is a set $A \subseteq X$ with $\mu(A) > 1-\epsilon$ and $\frac{\mathrm{d}S \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}(x) = 1$ for all $x \in A$. Does this imply that $T$ is close to being measure preserving in some sense, for example do we have that the quantity $||\frac{\mathrm{d}T \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu} - 1||_1$ or the quantity $- \int_X \log \frac{\mathrm{d}T \mu}{\mathrm{d}\mu}(x) \hspace{2 pt} \mathrm{d}\mu(x)$ is small? 

Let $S$ and $T$ be commuting measure-preserving transformations of a standard probability space $(X,\mu)$, so $S$ and $T$ define an action of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ on $(X,\mu)$. I am wondering about sequences of finite subsets $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ which are $L^p$-good for the pointwise ergodic theorem in the sense that for every $f \in L^p(X,\mu)$ the limit $$ \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{|F_n|} \sum_{(m_1,m_2) \in F_n} f(S^{m_1} T^{m_2} x) $$ exists for almost every $x \in X$. If $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ forms a tempered Folner sequence, it is well known that $(F_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ is $L^1$-good. I would like to hear what is known about analogs of Bourgain's subsequential ergodic theorems - i.e. the case where the $F_n$ are quite sparse. Specific examples of interest are $$F_n = \{(m_1^2,m_2^2): 0 \leq m_1,m_2 \leq n \},$$ more generally $$F_n = \{(p(m_1),q(m_2)): 0 \leq m_1,m_2 \leq n \}$$ for two polynomials $p$ and $q$ with integer coefficients, or $$ F_n = \{ (p_1,p_2): p_1 \mbox{ and } p_2 \mbox{ are among the first } n \mbox{ primes } \}.$$ There doesn't seem to be anything about this in Nevo's extensive survey 'Pointwise Ergodic Theorems for Actions of Groups' from the Handbook of Dynamical Systems. 

The curve $$(X-16)^3=XY\tag{1}\label{1}$$ is essential to Heegner's approach to the class number one problem for imaginary quadratic fields. We have the following “modular” parametrization \begin{equation}\tag{2}\label{2}(X,Y)=\left(2^{12}\Phi(\tau),j(\tau)\right),\end{equation} where $\Phi(\tau)=\frac{\Delta(2\tau)}{\Delta(\tau)}$. Note that the function $\Phi(\tau)$ is a Hauptmodul for the group $\Gamma_0(2)$. My questions are: 

Let $\mathcal M_m\subset M(2,\mathbb Z)$ be the set matrices with determinant $n$. The modular group $\Gamma$ acts on $\mathcal M_m$ from the left and we have the following finite set as a set of representatives of the orbits of this action $$\mathcal M_n^*=\bigg\lbrace \begin{pmatrix}a &b\\ 0 & d \end{pmatrix}:ad=m,0\leq b\leq d\bigg\rbrace.$$ Consider the modular equation $$\Phi_m(X,j(z))=\prod_{M\in\mathcal M_m^*}\left(X-j(Mz)\right).$$ It is straightforward to prove that this is actually a polynomial in two variables $\Phi_m(X,Y)$. Zagier shows in his notes, p. 71, that the leading coefficient of $\Phi_m(X,X)$ is invertible if $m$ is not a square. He also demonstrates that $j(z)$ is a root of $\Phi_m(X,X)$ if and only if $z$ is fixed by some matrix $M$ with determinant $m$. Zagier proceeds to show that for $z\in\mathfrak H$ a complex multiplication point of discriminat D, i.e. $Az^2+Bz+C=0$, $D=B^2-4AC$, $(A,B,C)=1$ the folowing two statements are equivalent: 

Here $\mathcal O_D$ is the unique quadratic order with discriminant $D$. The important consequence is that, given a CM point $z$, then the set of $m$ with the property that $\Phi_m(j(z),j(z))=0$ depends only on the disriminant $D$, not on $z$ itself. Therefore we can relate this with the class number $h(D)$. If $z_1,...,z_{h(D)}$ are the inequivalent points pertaining to the discriminat $D$ then either all of these points are roots of a given modular equation $\Phi_m(X,X)$ or none are. Let $$H_D(X)=\prod_{i=1}^{h(D)}\left(X-z_i\right).$$ Zagier now claims $$\Phi_m(X,X)=\pm\prod_{D<0}H_D(X)^{r_D(m)/w_D},\label{1}\tag{1}$$ if $m$ is not a square. Here is $$r_D(m)=\#\lbrace (t,u)\in \mathbb Z^2:t^2-D^2u^2=4m\rbrace=\#\lbrace \lambda\in \mathcal O_D: N(\lambda)=m\rbrace,$$ $$w_D=\# \text{ number of units in }\mathcal O_D. $$ However, Zagier is here very brief and I do not understand how he arrived at \eqref{1}. Why should the formula \eqref{1} hold? Note that if $F(a,a)=0$ then the multiplicity of $a$ as a root of $F(X,a)$ and $F(X,X)$ may differ. Let $D$ be a discriminant. Then by a suitable choice of elements $\lambda\in\mathcal O_D$ we should be able to achieve that $H_D(X)$ is the greatest common divisor of finitely many modular equations. This would show that the coefficients of $H_D(X)$ were rational. How to do this? How to choose the norms? (Cf. Zagier's article for more details.)
