Assuming "will measure the positions" means "will measure the parallaxes", this appears to be referring to the final version of GAIA which will be published in the early 2020s. To make things easier, $URL$ has a "tgas_source" subdirectory which just includes the 2,057,066 stars for which there is additional data (so you don't have to download the entire much larger GAIA archive). 

(Pluto is invisible but at the center of the cross-- the bright object nearby is 13 Oph, not Pluto). A perhaps more interesting question: what is the closest approach of the two orbits, even if the planets in question aren't occupying that given point in the orbit. 

Both of these look similar to my answer, so I'm reasonably confident that I'm correct this time. $URL$ if anyone wants to check my work Things to note: 

Beyond 65 degrees north or south latitude, the sun does not rise or set daily, and the length of sunrise/sunset increases significantly. The data plotted above is the length of sunrise, but the length of sunset is very similar. All calculations for this program were made with this program: $URL$ The raw output of sunrise/sunset times: $URL$ You can verify these results at: $URL$ The longest sunrise I found for 2015 was at 89 degrees 51 minutes south latitude, 125 degrees east longitude. There, the sun starts rising 20 Sep 2015 at 2352, bobbles up and down a bit (but never quite sets), and finally finishes rising 43 hours and 21 minutes later, at 22 Sep 2015 at 1913, but see caveat at the end of this answer. You can "verify" this by first visiting $URL$ with these parameters: 

I'm very sorry for you, but this is just (mathematical) probability at work and no (astronomical) pattern. I'm on mobile right now so I can't do a full analysis, but note that if you divide Mercury's period (3520.2) by 89 instead of 88, the result is 39.55. Still pretty close to 39.88. In other words, the larger the numbers get, the easier is to find a 'divisor' close to 39.88. 

As @RobJeffries mentions, you can calculate the difference from the equations which define magnitude and flux. But this particular case is even covered in the Wikipedia article on apparent magnitude: 

As discussed here, the path of the Sun resembles a sine wave (see the image below), with a (semi-)amplitude equal to the axial tilt of the Earth, usually denoted $\varepsilon$, about 23.4 degrees. A simple formula, which might be accurate for your purposes, is the following: if $a$ denotes the right ascension (in hours), the declination $\delta$ is given by the following formula: $$\delta = \varepsilon \sin(2\pi\frac{a}{24h})$$ The actual formula is more complicated. From the formulas linked to by @barrycarter: $$\alpha = \arctan(\cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda)$$ $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \sin\lambda)$$ we obtain $$\tan\alpha = \cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda$$ $$\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon} = \tan\lambda$$ so $$\lambda = \arctan\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon}$$ Plugging this into the declination formula, and using the fact that $\sin(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{\pm\sqrt{x^2+1}}$, we get $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \frac{\tan\alpha}{\pm\sqrt{\tan^2\alpha+\cos^2\varepsilon}})$$ (here the right ascension $\alpha$ is measured in radians or degrees, not hours). 

@rob-jeffries and @hde-226868 have both given excellent answers: after remembering that I was the OP, I upvoted both and approved one.This answer is mostly my attempt at redemption: 

Meeus' work (second link) mentions the 13425 CE event in "Table 1. Simultaneous and near-simultaneous transits of Mercury and Venus, years 1 to 300,000" Within the limits of DE431 (7 May 13201 BCE to 7 May 17091 CE), there is no time at which both Mercury and Venus transit the Sun. The closest we get to this: 

H. A. Rey sees Canis Minor as a dog's leash (maybe for one of those invisible pretend dogs?) And, if you really want to give it a go, here are all the stars in Canis Minor that are magnitude 5.5 or brighter: 

The clipping above from the Albuquerque Journal doesn't really answer your question, but astronomers have been hunting for a largeish planet beyond Pluto for quite some time now. See also: $URL$ $URL$ (under "United States Naval Observatory Calculations") $URL$ EDIT: Just to beat this to death, Percival Lowell may have been the first person to detect the 10th planet. Quoting $URL$ 

Batygin and Brown made a website which describes the search for the 9th planet in clear terms. They specifically note the following: 

The original paper states the methodology used to determine the location of the gravity waves. The bottom line is that they were detected in two different locations. Using the difference in timing, one can estimate the location in the sky to an area of about 600 degrees squared where the origin of the wave could have been. The two signals had an offset of 7 ms. Pure speed of light differences would have been 10 ms. This can be used to effectively identify a circle in the sky where the merger might have happened. Of course, this doesn't reveal the distance. The distance was figured by a number of things. First of all, the frequency pattern was used to estimate the mass of each black hole. Using these masses, one can find the estimated total power of the event. Using this estimate, and seeing the estimate of the amplitude from the signal, one can use the inverse squared law to estimate the distance to said event. 

Yes, you could definitely see Jupiter as a round object if it's angular diameter was 369 arcseconds. The limit for seeing something as round appears to be a diameter of around 1 arcminute. Notes: 

I might be misunderstanding your question, but using HORIZONS ($URL$ with these settings should give you the data you need: 

$URL$ gives G*m for the Sun as . $URL$ gives G as If these numbers were exact (they're not), the sun's mass (after converting m^3 to km^3 above) would be: 165890550052424250000000000000000000/83423 kg or about 1988546924138717739712069812881.3396785059276218789 kg or 1.9885469241387177397120698128813396785059276218789*10^30 kg Of course, that level of precision is ridiculously unwarranted, but I would argue that's the most precise value you can get, if you accept NASA's definitions of the sun's Gm and the universe's G. 

The program I used to compute this: $URL$ The list of transits I computed while solving this: $URL$ $URL$ Although I believe this answer is correct, Stellarium does not agree with me, and HORIZONS doesn't compute positions past 9999 CE, so don't put too much faith in this answer, since there's no good way to confirm it. I believe that I'm correct and Stellarium is wrong this far in the future, but it could be the other way around. Even if my calculations are correct, the uncertainty in calculating the relevant positions (Sun, Merucry, Venus, Earth) this far in the future is high. On their own transit pages, NASA only computes Venus transits from 2000 BCE to 4000 CE, and Mercury transits from 1601 CE to 2300 CE, even though they could've made the same calculations I made from 13201 BCE to 17091 CE: 

By definition, it is zero; the ecliptic is the plane of earth's orbit (or rather, the inverse: the path the Sun seems to follow along the sky). But you're probably looking for variations in the axial tilt of the Earth. There's a lot of formulas in the article, and on the (astronomically speaking) short timescale of a few million years, it oscillates between 22 and 24.5 degrees with a period of about 41,000 years. See the graph below, the red dot is the year 2000: 

This is not really known; while the rotation period of most of the larger satellites is known, and they're mostly synchronized, for the smaller ones it's harder to determine and they're less likely to be synchronized: 

The major axis is just the sum of the distance at perigee plus the distance at apogee. This is 400 km + 1500 km + the diameter (not radius) of the Earth, and the semi-major axis is half of that. However, the semi-minor axis is harder to determine. Therefore, why not use an alternative method to calculate the eccentricity? $$e = \frac{r_a-r_p}{r_a+r_p}$$ Here, the $r$'s are the distance to the center of the Earth, not the apside altitudes. Can you take it from here? 

state that UTC advanced from being 0.085272 seconds behind UT1 on 30 Dec 2015 to being only 0.083475 behind UT1 on 31 Dec 2015. That means UTC advanced on UT1 by 0.085272 minus 0.083475 (equals 0.001797) seconds. In other words, the rotation period from 30 Dec 2015 to 31 Dec 2015 was 86400.001797 seconds. Once the predicted UTC is more than 0.5 seconds ahead of UT1, a leap second will be announced for the following June 30th or December 31st. 

According to Stellarium, the vernal equinox will indeed be in Sagittarius in the year 6500, right around what we call 20h today (actually 19h53m): 

The canonical reference for all astronomical calculations is the CSPICE library: $URL$ and some of the more important files they use are the ephemeris files: $URL$ is one example, but you can poke around for others. I helped figure out the format (though it's actually fairly well documented) for Brandon's skyfield project (it's better than pyephem): $URL$ even though I'm not a huge fan of Python myself. I also created Perl and Mathematica programs to read/interpret the ephemeris files: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ (these are all fairly ugly, so poke around a bit). So, while I don't think there IS a MATLAB equivalent at the moment, it wouldn't be difficult to create one. Of course, using the well-tested CSPICE libraries is a better option unless you happen to loathe C 

So to look for it, one should look along the ecliptic, concentrating mostly on the area directly overhead in late November. Note that this is the part of the sky where the galactic center also appears. The inclination is estimated to be 30 degrees, plus or minus 20, so that distance from the ecliptic should be searched as well. 

I've seen a number of news reports indicating there is likely a 9th planet in our Solar System, something with an orbital period of between 10k-20k years, that is 10 times Earth's mass. I haven't seen any real indication of where this object might be. If I had access to a sufficient telescope, would I be able to find this planet, and what way would I point a telescope to find it? How far is it likely to be, or is that not well known? 

If you point a flashlight up, then the light will reach as far as the other ends of the universe, if one has a sensitive enough measuring device, so long as it is not absorbed. Of course, said device might require a lot of work, and a huge telescope. Lights can easily be seen by satellites, but it would take a huge telescope to see a single light from, say, the Moon, and even larger the further you go. In the case of your moving light, I would suspect a laser of some kind. Lasers are focused enough where one could easily see a reflection from the clouds, and pretty focused as well. It could be a moving light source, such as a plane or balloon of some kind as well. 

which suggests the calculation is being done in arcminutes, not degrees. Unfortunately, this doesn't help, since the result is 76.5283 arcminutes, which is nowhere near 2 degrees 19 minutes 28 seconds (which is 139.467 arcminutes). 134*sin(0:32) may refer to 32 seconds of arc, and the result is 0.02 which is 1 minute or arc (0:01). Terrible use of notation here if that actually is the case. 

Stars do not change their right ascension or declination values as the Earth turns. The position of the stars in the night sky (called azimuth and elevation) will change, but that's because the lines of right ascension also move. However, right ascension and declination do not uniquely define an object. Over time, stars move with respect to the sun (called "proper motion"), and the direction of the Earth's north pole (currently pointing near Polaris, the North Star) also changes (called "precession"). 

As noted in $URL$ the length of sunrise/sunset varies from approximately 128/cos(latitude) seconds at the equinoxes to approximately 142/cos(1.14*latitude) at the solstices. More specifically, here's the length of sunrise/sunset at various latitudes: 

Full answer: a conjunction like this 'nearly' happened on May 5th, 2000. NASA published an article about this event, stating: 

Well, this radiation is way too small to be detected by itself, even if the black hole would be at our doorstep. However, the radiation makes the black hole less massive and smaller and finally it will vanish, producing a gamma ray flash which we hope is detectable, even from a very large distance. As @JamesK notes in the comments, this evaporation will take extremely long for the 'common' black holes caused by supernovae and those found in galaxy centers, but smaller primordial black holes, formed in the very beginning of the universe, could be evaporating now and that's why we have a telescope looking for those gamma ray flashes. 

Phone cameras just aren't designed to take good photographs of astronomical objects. The sensor is too small and the configuration options (like exposure time) are minimal. For astronomical photography, a better option is to use (the body of) a DSLR (or the analog version); the lens is provided by your telescope. Another option is a specialized CCD camera. 

I wrote $URL$ to solve this with the full results at: $URL$ As viewed from RigelKentaurusB, the Sun has magnitude 0.48, and is the 10th brightest star in the sky. This is the only star system with known exoplanets where the Sun even makes the top 10. From EpsilonEridani, the sun shines at magnitude 2.37, making it the 79th brightest star in their sky. Things go rapidly downhill from there: 

This doesn't really answer your question, but I read $URL$ and noted that footnote 13 (which is referenced by equation 8, although it sort of looks like 3^13) reads: 

OLD ANSWER FOR REFERENCE (note that Sirius does not have known exoplanets, so the Sirius solution I propose below wouldn't work): As others have noted, since Sirius is 25 times more luminous than our Sun (though still not luminous as Canopus or Rigel), so it would be the brightest star for most nearby star systems, and all the exoplanets we've found are fairly closeby. The only possible exception would be an exoplanet orbiting Sirius itself, since Sirius would be considered their sun, and not a star in the night sky. Unfortunately, Sirius' smaller companion, Sirius B, would be much brighter than our Sun there. I'm also pretty sure Sirius B would be in the night sky (not just in the daytime sky), so it would count. I'd like to poke around a bit more before declaring this answer complete. I think I can show that any point where the Sun is brighter than Sirius must be less than 4.3 light years (and probably much less) away from our solar system, so, unless we discover an star system MUCH closer than Proxima Centauri, there are no exoplanets where our Sun is the brightest star.
