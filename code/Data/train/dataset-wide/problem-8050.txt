Any countable Borel equivalence relation can arise from a Borel action of the free group on $\omega$ generators, which is a natural enough group. You should probably ask instead whether the action can be natural. Can the action be free, for example, as Joel discusses. The field of countable Borel equivalence relations has gained a tremendous amount from studying equivalence relations arising from natural group actions. However, for the case of Turing equivalence, viewing this relation as arising from the Borel action of a countable group does not appear to be a helpful way of thinking. You might be interesting in the following open question (from my thesis). The question essentially asks whether the Turing reductions are the unique way to generate Turing equivalence: Suppose that $\{\psi_i\}_{i \in \omega}$ is any countable collection of partial Borel functions closed under composition such that $x$ and $y$ are Turing equivalent if and only if there exists an $i$ and a $j$ such that $\psi_i(x) = y$ and $\psi_j(y) = x$. Suppose also that $\{\varphi_i\}_{i \in \omega}$ is an enumeration of the Turing reductions. Then must there be a pointed perfect set $P$ and a function $u: \omega^2 \rightarrow \omega^2$ such that for every pair of Turing reductions $\varphi_i$ and $\varphi_j$, if $x,y \in P$ and $\varphi_i(x) = y$ and $\varphi_j(y) = x$, then $\psi_k(x) = y$ and $\psi_l(y) = x$, where $u(i,j) = (k,l)$? It is probably optimistic to hope that the answer to the above question is "yes", when we have no idea how to approach this problem. However, beyond the question being nice in and of itself, a positive answer would have a large number of consequences. It would imply Martin's conjecture on Turing invariant functions is true, for example, which in turn would have a lot of consequences for the theory of countable Borel equivalence relations. A positive answer would also imply any universal countable Borel equivalence relation must be able to witness its universality uniformly, regardless of the way it is generated. A nice implication of this would be that any increasing union of non-universal countable Borel equivalence relations must be non-universal. 

In Solovay paper, "A model of set theory in which every set of reals is Lebesgue measurable", he cites in the end a theorem 4.1 (generalization of results), which says, roughly that in $\mathfrak{N}_1$ (the Solovay model), for $X$ a complete separable metric space, then every set $A \subset X$ has the property of Baire and other properties. Is it possible to deduce a theorem which would be like: in $\mathfrak{N}=\mathfrak{M}[G]$(the full Solovay model) every set $A \subset X$ definable from a countable sequence of ordinals has the property of Baire? Edit: This question remains unanswered, but I would like to add one detail to it: $X$ the complete separable metric space may not have a "definable" topology, so the basic open sets may not be definable from a countable sequence of ordinals. Does the same remark in the comments below still hold though? Further Edit: What happens in the case where the topology and the metric of $X$ are definable from ordinals and $X$, in the sense that the metric is definable by a formula whose parameters are ordinals and $X$? 

A $B$ with the above two properties gives a positive answer to your question by the following reasoning. We can prove by induction that for any $n$, $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. This is trivial when $n = 0$. Now for the inductive case, assume $B^{(n)} \equiv_T 0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n}$. Then we see that $B^{(n+1)} \equiv_T (0^{(n)} \oplus C_n)' \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n$ since $C_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and hence $1$-generic relative to $0^{(n)}$. Finally, $0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_n \equiv_T 0^{(n+1)} \oplus C_{n+1}$ because either $n \notin A$ and so $C_n = C_{n+1}$ or $n \in A$ so $C_{n+1} \equiv_T B_n \oplus C_n$, but then $B_n \leq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. Hence, $B^{(n)}$ cannot compute $A$ for any $n \in \omega$, since $C_{n}$ is $(n+1)$-generic, and so $0^{(n)} \oplus C_{n} \ngeq_T 0^{(n+1)}$. (Indeed, it's easy to see that $B$ is $GL_n$ for every $n \in \N$). Thus, $A$ is not arithmetically definable relative to $B$. 

Graph combinatorics is very different under AD to what we are used to under AC. For example, under AD there is an acyclic graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with no 2-coloring (indeed, no coloring with countably many colors). Hall's marriage theorem is also false, even in a very trivial case: there is a 2-regular bipartite graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with no perfect matching. These theorems both follow from the assertion that every set of reals has the Baire property, and the arguments can be found in Kechris-Solecki-Todorcevic's 1999 paper: Borel Chromatic Numbers. I also have a recent paper on descriptive combinatorics that directly uses the axiom of determinacy, and not just measure or category arguments. For example, I show that under AD, for every n, there is an acyclic n-regular graph on $\mathbb{R}$ with chromatic number n+1, and an acyclic bipartite n-regular graph with no perfect matching. The games I use are based on partitions of free products of countable groups into two pieces. 

I am interested in the following question: Given a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and an $\epsilon>0$ small enough, how many $d$-simplices $\{D_i\}_{i=1}^m\subset K$ do we need at least so that the volume of $K\setminus \cup_{i=1}^m D_i$ is at most $\epsilon\mathrm{vol}(K)$? Similar question has been considered for approximating polytopes with given number of vertices or faces, but I am not aware of any result of this kind. Any comment shall be greatly appreciated. 

Classical results concerning concentration of Gaussian random variables due to Cirelson, Ibragimov and Sudakov say that if $V_1,\cdots,V_n$ are jointly Gaussian with variance bounded by $1$, then (constant can be improved but not much of my concern) \begin{equation} \mathbb{P}(|M-\mathbb{E}[M]|>t)\leq 2\exp(-t^2/2) \end{equation} where $M=\max_{1\leq i\leq n}V_i$. Similar dimension-free concentration results hold for suprema of Gaussian process indexed by general $T$. This follows by the general log-Sobolev inequality for Gaussian measures. For general processes, the approach I'm aware of involves some kind of maximal inequality(c.f. van de Vaart and Wellner(1996)), where in the concentration bound an entropy number measuring the size of $T$ is necessary. My question is that, is the dimension free concentration phenomenon unique to Gaussian processes, or even when $|T|<\infty$, do we have analogous result to the above display when $V_i$'s are non-Gaussian? In particular, I'm curious if there is any analogous result of this type with (possibly) $$\mathbb{P}(|M-\mathbb{E}[M]|>t)\leq C t^{-\alpha} \wedge 1$$ for some $\alpha>0$ that may be determined by moment conditions of $V_i$'s? 

Let $M$ be a saturated model of a theory $T$ in a first-order language $\mathcal{L}$, and let $N$ be a submodel of $M$. Is it possible to have a substructure $A\neq N$ of $M$ such that $N \subset A \subset M$ and every element of $A$ is definable by a formula in $L$ with parameters from $N$? 

Given structures $A_i$ each of cardinality $<\kappa$ where $\kappa$ is a measurable cardinal, the cardinalities of the $A_i$ are not uniformly bounded by a cardinal $\lambda <\kappa$, and $\mathcal{U}$ a $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter over $\kappa$, what is the cardinality of the ultraproduct $\prod A_i/\mathcal{U}$? Edit: The ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ is also assumed to be normal. For all the other missing data, which I am not aware of, please let me know of the case in which the ultraproduct is only of cardinality $\kappa$ (and as a by product is not isomorphic to any of the $A_i$). 

Assume we have a countable transitive model of set theory which satisfies some set of first-order axioms $T$. Is it possible to get from this a model $\mathcal{M}$ of set theory which satisfies the following: 

As far as actual jump inversion goes, any degree $X \geq 0^{(n)}$ is the $n$th jump of some other degree. An easy way to see this is to apply Friedberg jump inversion relative to $0^{(n-1)}$, then relative to $0^{(n-2)}$, and so on down to $0$. The theorem is also true through transfinite iterates of the jump: if $X \geq 0^{(\alpha)}$, then $X$ is the $\alpha$th jump of some degree. The general version of this theorem for any $\alpha$-REA operator is due to Jockusch and Shore (1984). 

If $n \notin A$, then $B_n$ is arithmetically generic, and if $n \in A$, then $B_n$ is $(n+1)$-generic and computable from $0^{(n+1)}$. Hence $\{n \in \mathbb{N} : \text{$B_n$ is arithmetic}\}$ is equal to $A$. For each $k \in \N$, let $m_i$ be the $i$th element of the set $\{m \in \N : m \notin A \lor m \geq k\}$. Then $C_k = \bigoplus_{i \in \omega} B_{m_i}$ is $(k+1)$-generic. 

There are a couple well known proofs of incompleteness based on properties of PA degrees. PA degrees have been studied extensively in recursion theory. A PA degree is a Turing degree that can compute a complete extension of PA. Obviously, to prove the incompleteness theorem, it's enough to show that no PA degree can be recursive. (If we had a consistent r.e. theory T extending PA that was not incomplete, then its completion would be recursive -- to decide whether $T \models \varphi$ or $T \models \neg \varphi$, simply look for a proof of $\varphi$ or $\neg \varphi$ from $T$, and because $T$ is assumed to be complete, this process always terminates and is hence recursive). One way to see that there are no recursive PA degrees is to observe that any PA degree can compute a nonstandard model of PA via compactness and a Henkin construction. Now apply Tennenbaum's theorem that there are no recursive nonstandard models of PA. Another way to see that there are no recursive PA degrees is with $\Pi^0_1$ classes. Every PA degree can compute a path through each $\Pi^0_1$ class (this is one direction of the Scott basis theorem). To finish, note that one can construct $\Pi^0_1$ classes that do not contain any recursive elements. For instance, there are $\Pi^0_1$ classes that contain only diagonally nonrecursive elements. 

The problem setup is simple: Given a $d$-simplex $\Delta_d:=\{(x_1,\cdots,x_d):x_i\geq 0,\sum_i x_i\leq 1\}$, can we construct a finite sequence of parallelotope $A_i$ so that $\Delta_d=\cup_{i=1}^N A_i$, where $N$ may depend optimally on $d$ in the sense any sequence of such covers must have cardinality lower bounded by $N$ up to a universal constant. The problem in dimension $d=1,2$ is straightforward. However even in $d=3$, it is not clear to me if there is such a construction. My main motivation for such a result is trying to reduce certain problem on simplex to parallelotope, which is easier to handle. Any comment shall be greatly appreciated. 

Consider a special type of convex function $g(\cdot):\mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}_+\cup\{+\infty\}$ such that $g(x)=+\infty$ as $|x|\to \infty$. Then $g$ is differentiable almost everywhere within its domain. Now consider the quantity $$\frac{\nabla g(x)}{(g(x))^{1+\delta}},$$ where $\delta>0$. Can we get some estimate of type $$||\nabla g(x)||_2\leq c_g(1+|x|)^{-\gamma} ((g(x))^{1+\delta}$$ for some $\gamma>0$ and all $|x|>R$, where $c_g$ may depend on some 'local' information of $g$ but not asymptotically as $x \to \infty$, and $R$ is independent of $g$? Or is there a counterexample? 

I read somewhere about the hyperuniverse of countable transitive models of ZFC ($URL$ It states an assumption, namely that every real is a member of some countable transitive model of ZFC. Is there some way to prove this assumption (assuming the hyperuniverse is not empty), or rather the (seemingly stronger) one: Every finite set of reals is a member of a ctm? 

The meager sets are sets which are union of $\lambda$ nowhere dense sets where $\lambda < \kappa$ and $\kappa$ is the cardinality of the space. If we consider a model of ZFC $\mathfrak{M}$ in which every (suitably definable) set of reals have the property of Baire, then every (suitably definable) set of a suitably defined toplogical space have the "generalized" Baire property. 

Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a model of set theory, and consider HOD (the hereditarily ordinal definable elements) of $\mathfrak{M}$. Let $K$ be any algebraically closed field in HOD of zero characteristic and any cardinality. Is there always a real closed subfield $R$ of $K$ of index 2 such that $R \in $ HOD? Under what condition $R$ is archimedean? Or rather, can we always find an archimedean real closed subfield $R$ of $K$ such that $R \in$ HOD?
