Fundamentally, because L1 orbits with the moon, for every 24 hour period, points A,B,C,D will always return to the same position; but, the station will orbit 13 degrees to the marked L1 positions, each one above points A, B, C, and D respectively. Now suppose we have three shifts, each representing countries in the Cyan (CY), Magenta (MG), and Yellow (YW) nations below; and, suppose that the shifts are marked as CY from 00:00-08:00, MG from 08:00-16:00, and YW from 16:00-24:00. This means that after 9 days, the Earth will have rotated 9 times, and be at the same position; but, the station will have traveled 119.7 degrees around earth, or ~ 1/3 of its orbit. As a result, when CY begins their shift at 00:00 hundred hours, they'll find that directly below them is the start of MG territory. Normally this would indicate that they are ending their shift and MG's shift is about to begin; but, the station time is 00:00. If you choose L1, your station will need to use a 23.11 H day with shifts every 7.7 Hours (7 hours 42 minutes) to ensure shifts start and terminate above their respective territories. 

which allows us to ignore the possibility of children being disowned and disinherited. But you also specified:

No (given modern technology) Yes (given scifi technology) Discussion GuildsBounty discussed the modern applications and shortfalls here. The short version is that toroidal configurations are presently unstable, only lasting $1 \times 10^{-6} ~\text{s}$ as of the 1990s. You'd need significant improvements in their stability to maintain themselves for a useful amount of time. 

So how do we motivate the wealthy to raise more children? By looking at what currently motivates them and structure raising children as providing a similar benefit. In this case, they are very clearly motivated by a desire to pay less taxes. Therefore, Legislate tax breaks proportional to the number of kids raised. Write the legislation so that the amount of money saved from taxes per child is greater than the amount of money spent to care for each child per tax year. This creates a net-tax break. Structure the legislation so that raising more kids returns a greater tax break. More importantly: do not cap it leaving it uncapped maximizes the generational distribution of wealth. This creates a dangerous issue: exploitation How does one protect the children from malicious upperclassmen who intends to exploit them for financial gain? It would seem simple to legislate the following points: 1. Each child must be guaranteed a share of the inheritance. 2. Each child must be treated humanely (and this much be checked) 3. If the child dies or goes missing, formal investigations must be had. But, we're talking about the supremely wealthy and their armies of lawyers and accountants. Obviously, if they'd like to maximize their tax cut, they will be motivated to adopt a massive number of children. In the short term, this benefits them; however, in the long term, they may wish to keep their wealth and not distribute it after their death. Similarly, they may wish to keep the children at a manageable age to reduce costs and psychological overhead. Anecdotal example: rich teens invokes far more legal fees than rich 10 year olds. Or, they could sell the kids (ex: females) when they reach a certain age and make a tidy profit. Therefore, they may attempt to trade or remove kids from their parentage, be it adoption to another wealthy family, or 'mysterious disappearances' (read: murder, human-trafficking, slavery, prostitution). Without heavy government oversight, it would be simple for the obscenely wealthy and obscenely malicious to exploit lower-class adopters for financial gain. Similarly, one can see them forming the equivalent of a foster home. In essence, you'd be shifting the foster-care system to the wealthy; but, like the current foster care system, incredible oversight will be required to prevent exploitation. 

I'm fairly certain there must be ulterior motives here, or possibly inter-agency politicking and counter-cooperation. Santa "knows when you've been bad or good" is fairly strong evidence to him being in league with the NSA. Considering that NORAD is likely to be involved in the development of any military stealth program, SaNSAta is probably working on some sort of alternative stealth technology so they can more effectively spy on civilians and the military. We don't really want to help them, do we? What? Oh, of course. Everybody knows proper eggnog has a decent helping of rum. No! I have not had too much! You mean this isn't Skeptics.SE? Oh... Um... nevermind, then! 

You make mention of anti-gravity, but also talk about walkways on the sides of buildings. More than just anti-gravity (reducing the effects of gravity), this implies that your futuretech is actually directional gravity manipulation. Anti-gravity alone would have a great effect on construction. Buildings of far taller sizes could be manufactured with greater ease - you would not need nearly as powerful cranes to lift building materials. If the anti-gravity technology can be built into the structure itself, you could potentially use lighter materials because the load of the whole building could be reduced. Either way, the end result is verticality - buildings would be very, very tall. (The manufacturing implications of gravity control technology is touched on, albeit briefly as it is not the focus of the story, in David Weber's Honorverse.) Assuming the cost was cheap enough, anti-gravity would also drastically improve the capability of humans getting into orbit. As an alternative to tall terrestrial structures, you'd have the capability of building large structures in space. If the technology is truly directional gravity manipulation, you could provide those structures with internal artificial gravity, eliminating the zero-gee related problems of long term space habitation. Anti-gravity without directional gravity manipulation would still reduce resupply concerns, making living in orbit more attractive. Despite easing the engineering implications, I think the larger concern is the human factor. The human body uses a combination of what is effectively a gyroscope in the inner ear and visual stimulus to determine where you are and where you're going. Without having directional gravity manipulation, there's no way for us to test it, but I suspect there would be issue with your proposed walkways - the ear, subject to gravity would be telling the brain one thing (down is towards my feet) while the eyes would be saying something different based on the horizon. In a space habitat, the horizon/orientation problem is mitigated because the environment is presumably small enough that your senses tell you you're inside at all times. TLDR Buildings would get taller and/or leave the planet completely, but the orientation would remain the same. 

A shapeshifter doesn't "choose" an original form. A shapeshifter's "original" is whatever form it started as - that's what "original" means. That form is whatever it was in before it gained/learned/discovered its ability to shapeshift. In cases where maintaining a shape requires concentration and effort (Odo in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), has a maximum time limit, or is triggered by an outside influence or external catalyst (classic werewolves), a shapeshifer may have a default form that they revert to when resting (Odo turns to a liquid) or in absence of the catalyst (werewolves become human). Shapeshifters without such a restriction (Mystique from X-Men) or with a default form not conducive to interaction (Odo, again) may have a preferred form. As Cort explains, having such a form helps such an entity reinforce its sense of self. Sentient beings in most stories want to have some way to be relateable to other sentient beings; a preferred form helps you maintain those relationships, too.

How to derive the Scale Height The Nebraska Astronomy Applet Project of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln provides a complete derivation of Scale Height with respect to Planetary atmospheres which I will duplicate below. Please note that I'll hold of on explaining what each symbol means until Part 3: Calculating the Scale Height. First we begin with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium. (1). $~~ dP = - \rho g dz$ Then we use the ideal gas law to simplify (1). We may use one of two forms: (2). $~~ P = \cfrac{kT}{\mu m_\mu} \rho$ (3). $~~ \rho = \cfrac{ kT}{\mu m_\mu} P$ to eliminate $\rho$ or P from (1). Using (2) returns (4) and using (3) returns (5): (4). $~~ dP = - \left( \cfrac{\mu m_\mu P}{kT} \right) g dz$ (5). $~~ d\rho = - \left( \cfrac{\mu m_\mu \rho}{kT} \right) g dz$ Shift P or /rho to the left hand side and you'll arrive at: (6). $~~ \cfrac{dP}{P} = - \left( \cfrac{\mu m_\mu}{kT} \right) g dz$ (7). $~~ \cfrac{d\rho}{\rho} = - \left( \cfrac{\mu m_\mu }{kT} \right) g dz$ If you look closely, you'll notice that the formulas are identical, and therefore equivalent. It then follows that whichever we solve for, will have an identical form to the other. Taking after the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, we'll derive the scale height from pressure and continue with (6). Integrate from the surface of the planet ($P_i = P_0$, $z_i = 0$) to some height ($P_f = P$, $z_f =z$). $\int{\cfrac{dP}{P}} = - \cfrac{\mu m_\mu }{kT} g \int dz $ $\ln P |_{P_0}^P = \left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu }{kT} g \right) z |_{0}^z $ $\ln P - \ln P_0 = \left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu }{kT} g \right) (z-0) $ Use the logarithmic identity for subtraction to simplify the left hand side. $\ln \cfrac{P}{P_0} = \left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu g}{kT} \right) z $ Raise the entire formula to an exponent to eliminate the logarithm, then rearrange as a function of pressure. $e^{\ln \cfrac{P}{P_0}} = e^{\left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu g}{kT} \right) z} $ (8). $~~ P = P_0 e^{\left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu g}{kT} \right) z} $ Lump the coefficients on z into a single coefficient. We'll call it H. (9). $~~ H = \left(\cfrac{kT}{\mu m_\mu g} \right)$ Then (1) simplifies to: $P = P_0 e^{-\cfrac{z}{H}} $ Since H is a constant coefficient, if we take z to equal it (z = H), then we'll get: $ P = P_0 e^{- 1} = \cfrac{P_0}{e} $ Therefore we formally define $H$ as the height where the pressure drops to $\frac{1}{e}$ of the surface pressure, i.e. The Scale Factor. Determine Air density at a given height. Recall earlier how the Scale Factor may be derived either from pressure or density? Using density instead of pressure, i.e. formula (7) to derive the scale factor gives us: (10). $~~ \rho = \rho_0 e^{\left(- \cfrac{\mu m_\mu g}{kT} \right) z} $ using the same logic as before: $H = \left( \cfrac{kT}{\mu m_\mu g} \right)$ which is the scale height. Therefore (10) may be used to calculate the air density at a given height, or in your case, at the scale height. Calculating your scale height. $m_\mu$ is the atomic mass constant: $1.66 \times 10^−27 \frac{kg}{amu}$. k is the Boltzmann Constant: $1.38 \times 10^−23 \frac{J}{K}$. g is the surface gravity: $11.127 \frac{m}{s^2}$. T is the temperature of the gas (average temperature of the atmosphere): $\overline T = \frac{8.0°C + 2.9°C}{2} = 5.45 °C = 278.6 K $ $\mu$ is the average particle mass of the gas (our atmosphere). Similarly to The University of Nebraska-Lincoln, we compute this from the weighted composition of the atmosphere: $\mu = 0.771 m_{N_2} + 0.222 m_He + 0.004 m_{O_2} + 0.002 m_{Ar}$ $\mu = (0.771)(28) + (0.222)(4) + (0.004)(32) + (0.002)(39)$ $\mu = (0.771)(28) + (0.222)(4) + (0.004)(32) + (0.002)(39) = 22.682 amu$ Plugging these values into formula (9) returns: $H = 9176.83 m $ or $H = 9.177 km $ Therefore the air density at a given height, z, is $\rho = \rho_0 e^{- \cfrac{z}{9176.83 m}} $ Sample densities: Since the scale factor is the distance required to reduce the pressure or density by $\frac{1}{e}$ sample pressures and densities at integer multiples of the scale factor ($nH$) are simple to calculate. $\rho = \rho_0 e^{- \cfrac{nH}{H}} =\rho_0 e^{-n} = \cfrac{\rho_0}{e^n} $ $$\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \text{Elevation} & \text{n} & \text{coefficient} & \rho & P\\ \hline 0 & \text{0} & \left(\cfrac{1}{1}\right) & 1.000 \rho_0 & P_0\\ \hline H & \text{1} & \left(\cfrac{1}{e}\right) & 0.368 \rho_0 & 0.368 P_0\\ \hline 2H & \text{2} & \left(\cfrac{1}{e^2}\right) & 0.135 \rho_0 & 0.135 P_0\\ \hline 3H & \text{3} & \left(\cfrac{1}{e^3}\right) & 0.050 \rho_0 & 0.050 P_0\\ \hline 4H & \text{4} & \left(\cfrac{1}{e^4}\right) & 0.018 \rho_0 & 0.050 P_0\\ \hline \end{array}$$
