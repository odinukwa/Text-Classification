Let me start by rigorously pose my question. Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $2$, let $n$ be an even integer number, let $f(X) = X^n + T_1 X^{n-1} + \cdots + T_n$, be the generic polynomial, that is, $T = (T_1, \ldots, T_n)$ is a tuple of algebraically independent variables over $K$. Let $\Omega = $ { $\omega_1, \ldots, \omega_m$} be a finite subset of $K$, let $f_i(X) = f(X) - \omega_i$, and let $F_i$ be the splitting field of $f_i$ over $K(T)$ ($i=1,\ldots, m$). Question: For which $\Omega$ the splitting fields $F_1, \ldots, F_m$ are linearly disjoint over $K(T)$? Remarks: 

Let $G$ be a degree $n$ group, i.e., a subgroup of the symmetric group $S_n$. Let $p(G)$ be the number of $n$-cycles in $G$ divided by the size of $G$. Examples: 

If $G$ is a cyclic transitive group, then $p=\varphi(n)/n$. If $G=S_n$, then $p=1/n$. (If $G$ is not transitive, then $p=0$) 

If C is a family of finite groups that is closed to taking quotients, normal subgroups, and extensions, then the free group on two generators embeds into the pro-C completion. Such C's can be the finite p-groups or the finite solvable groups, and others. See, e.g., Fried-Jarden's Field Arithmetic, Prop. 17.5.11, for a proof. 

In fact, $H^1(K,M)$ is infinite not only to the family of number fields, but also to the more general family of Hilbertian fields (those fields which satisfies the Hilbert irreducibility theorem). Below is a proof based on embedding problems: Let $K$ be Hilbertian with absolute Galois group $G_K$ and $M$ a finite nontrivial $G_K$module. A finite embedding problem for a field $K$ is a pair of two epimorphisms (all morphisms in this answer are assumed to continuous) $$ \mathcal{E}=(\alpha\colon G_K\to G ; \beta \colon \Gamma\to G) $$ with $\Gamma$ finite. A solution of $\mathcal{E}$, in this answer, is an epimorphism $\psi\colon G_K \to \Gamma$ with $\alpha = \beta\circ \psi$. If $M$ is a finite $G_K$-module, then from continuity of the action, there exists an open subgroup $U$ of $G_K$ that acts trivially on $M$, and so the action factors through $G:=G_K/U$; let $\alpha\colon G_K\to G$ be the quotient map. Then, we have the semi-direct product $\Gamma = M\rtimes G$ and the projection map $\beta\colon \Gamma\to G$, which form the embedding problem $$ (1)\qquad \mathcal{E}=(\alpha\colon G_K \to G,\beta\colon \Gamma\to G), \qquad \Gamma =M\rtimes G, $$ We note that $\mathcal{E}$ is split in the sense that $\beta$ has a group theoretical section and $\mathcal{E}$ has an abelian kernel in the sense that $M = \ker\beta$ is abelian. In a similar fashion, for any $n>0$, we may construct the embedding problem $$ \mathcal{E}_n = (\alpha\colon G_K ; \beta_n \colon \Gamma_n \to G), $$ where $\Gamma_n = M^n\rtimes G$ and $\beta_n$ is the quotient map. To be precise, here $G$ acts on $M^n$ coordinate-wise; i.e., $g.(m_1,\ldots, m_n) := (g.m_1,\ldots, g.m_n)$. Theorem (Ikeda, [Fried-Jarden, Field Arithmetic 2nd edtn, Prop. 16.4.5]) If $K$ is Hilbertian, then any split embedding problem with abelian kernel has a solution; in particular, $\mathcal{E}_n$ has a solution $\Psi \colon G_K\to \Gamma_n$. We note that $\Psi$ gives rise to $n$ distinct solutions of $\mathcal{E}$: Proposition Under the notation above, let $\pi_i\colon \Gamma_n\to \Gamma$ be the projection map given by $\pi_i((m_1,\ldots,m_n)g) = (m_i,g)$. Then, a) $\psi_i = \pi_i\circ \Psi$ is a solution of $\mathcal{E}$. b) For all $i\neq j$ one has $\ker \psi_i \ker \psi_j = \ker \alpha$, and, in particular, if $M\neq 0$, then $\ker \psi_i\neq \ker \psi_j$. Proof. a) is immediate. For b), put $M'_i = \ker \pi$, so $M'_i = \{(m_1,\ldots, m_n)\in M^n : m_i=0\}$. Then if $i\neq j$, then \begin{equation}\label{eq:EQ} (2) \qquad M_i'M_j'=M^n. \end{equation} Note that we have $$ (3) \Psi^{-1}(M_i') =\ker \psi_i \quad \mbox{and} \quad \Psi^{-1}(M^n) = \Psi^{-1}(\ker\beta_n) = \ker (\beta_n\circ \Psi) = \ker \alpha, $$ Since $\Psi\colon G_K\to \Gamma_n$ is surjective, it induces a bijection between subgroups of $G_K$ containing $\ker \Psi$ and subgroups of $\Gamma_n$; namely, $H\leq \Gamma_n$ corresponds to $\Psi^{-1}(H)$. So (2) and (3) give that $$(4)\qquad \ker \psi_i \ker \psi_j = \ker \alpha. $$ If $M\neq 0$, then $M_i'\neq M^n$, and so $\ker \psi_i\lneq \ker\alpha$. Thus, (4) implies that $\ker\psi_i\neq \ker\psi_j$, and in particular $\psi_i\neq \psi_j$. QED Corollary If $M\neq 0$, then the embedding problem $\mathcal{E}$ given in (1) has infinitely many solutions. Each solution $\psi$ of $\mathcal{E}$ given in (1) induces a $1$-cocyle in $c\in H^1(K,M)$. Indeed, $c$ is defined by $$ \psi(g) = (c(g),\alpha(g))\in \Gamma $$ (recall that $G=G_K/U$ and $\alpha\colon G_K\to G$ is the quotient map) or equivalently by $$ c(g) = \psi(g) \alpha(g)^{-1}. $$ Obviously, these formulas imply that the map from solutions to cocycles is injective, and so the Corollary gives infinitely many cocycles, and so $H^1(K,M)$ is also infinite. 

De Morgan established a calculus of binary relations in 1860. Charles Peirce turned out to the subject in 1870, and found most of the interesting equational laws of relation algebra. The subject fell into neglect between 1900 and 1940, to be revived by Alfred Tarski. 

find a pair of binary operations (and constants) satisfying semiring laws, or prove that no such operations exist 

As the structure is finite, one can approach problem #1 via computerized search. For illustration purpose if I had boolean algebra with operations $\vee$, $\wedge$, and $\neg$, then the search would return semiring operations $\oplus$ and $\otimes$ expressed via those. However, if this search fails, how would I prove that no such operations exist? I assume that there are fundamental properties of semirings, that can be employed. By "fundamental" I mean that they don't explicitly refer to semiring operations; they only assume that such operations exist. Therefore, one just have to show that my lattice doesn't possess those. So what are fundamental properties of semirings? Edit: to give a justification why I suspect semiring structure can exist is that my lattice is in many respects is similar to relation algebra. Unfortunately, what might be considered the intuitive analogous of composition operation is not associative. Yet, the structure contains more than one instance of everything: there are two conjunction, two disjunctions, two negations, and four constants, so there might be more than one way to manufacture composition. 

The properties of binary relations such as reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity are ubiquitous. What about ternary relations, which properties can we consider fundamental? For motivation here is the one that looks like generalized transitivity: 

Let G be a [ CF ] grammar, and let elements of semiring be sets of rules. Define multiplication as: $$ x\otimes y = \{ t| \exists r \in x \exists s \in y (t=subst(r,s))\} $$ where $subst(r,s)$ is rewriting of grammar rule $r$ by formal substitution of one symbol in the rule body matching $s$ head with $s$ body. For example, the rule 

Did programme of predicate calculus algebraization succeed? In his essay An autobiography of polyadic algebras Halmos outlined why he is not satisfied with his baby. I suggest that Cylindric algebras are not genuine algebras either; what other algebraic structures have operators parametrized by something (cylindrification)? The situation is strikingly different from either boolean or relation algebra, each having a set of intuitive binary, unary, [and 0-ary] operations. I suggest that the culprit is positional perspective onto relation attributes. Positional perspective is ubiquitous in math (sequences, function arguments, etc), so is easy to see why it penetrated into the world of relations. Positional perspective makes perfect sense for binary relations, this is why nobody challenged its adequacy for n-ary ones. However, it is easy to see that attribute positions are not essential to the ability to match values of the two different attributes of two different relations. Named attribute perspective is widely used in database theory and practice, which implies yet another algebraization of predicate logic. 

Motivation: The linear disjointness of the splitting fields allows one to calculate a Galois group of a composite of polynomials, which in turn yields arithmetic features of the ring of polynomials over large finite fields. Let me not elaborate on that here 

One can see that $p(G)=k/n$, where $k$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $n$-cycles, so the answer is YES if $n$ is prime. Numerical testing shows the answer is YES for $n\leq 30$ and for primitive groups for $n\leq 1000$. There are non-cyclic groups achieving the bound $\varphi(n)/n$, e.g., the wreath product of cyclic groups. 

It is a special case of thm 2.3 in $URL$ (version 3, I've just updated it, it has a different number in version 2) that the factorization pattern of polynomials $x^q-(ax^2+bx+c)$ distributes the same as random permutation in $S_n$ (unless $q$ is a power of $2$). In fact this theorem deals with $h(x) + (ax^2+bx+c)$, uniformly on $h$ of fixed degrees. In the case $x^{p^2} - (bx+c)$, for example, the factorization is related to cycle structure of permutations in the group of transformations of the affine line over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$, while in $x^{p^2+1}-(bx+c)$ it is related to the transformations of the projective line. See last section in the ms. 

The following questions popped out while I was preparing a course on profinite groups. Closed subgroups of free profinite groups are not necessarily profinite free (e.g. the p-sylow subgroups, or the kernel of the map on the maximum p quotient, and many more other examples) thus the Nielsen-Schreier theorem fails in the profinite category. Nevertheless, Nielsen-Schreier theorem carries over for open subgroups. The proofs I found (in Field Arithmetic by Fried-Jarden and in Profinite Groups by Ribes-Zalesskii) use the construction of free profinite groups as restricted completion of free abstract groups AND the Schreier basis of a finite indexed subgroup of a free abstract group. By restricted I mean that if X is a basis of a free abstract group, then the completion is w.r.t. the family of finite index normal subgroups that contain all but finitely many elements of X. 

The degree of the minimal polynomial of your cos is bounded below by phi(n)/2 since it generates a real field inside the cyclotomic field. If phi(n)/2 is bigger than 8 you are done. For small n you can check one by one with computer (or write the minimal polynomial and see it doesn’t divide that polynomial or compute discriminant, which is an easy thing for cosine as the real part of a root of unity) 

This form of a semi-Riemannian metric is beloved of both numerical and mathematical relativists, but especially the former. The starting point is usually a globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,h)$. Then $M$ can be foliated by surfaces $\Sigma_t$ of constant $t$, where $t$ is a global time coordinate i.e. a $C^1$ function $t:M\to\mathbb{R}$ such that the 1-form $dt$ is non-vanishing and everywhere timelike: $h^{-1}(dt,dt)<0$. Each $\Sigma_t$ is a Riemannian 3-manifold with metric $g$ inherited from $(M,h)$. The most convenient way to write this metric is $g=h+n\otimes n$, where $n$ is the normal 1-form of $\Sigma_t$ with unit length. The lapse and shift are not canonical or unique. They are defined with respect to a choice of future pointing timelike vector field $\vec{t}$, conventionally normalized by $dt(\vec{t})=1$. Then the lapse is $N=-n(\vec{t})$ and the shift 1-form is defined by $\beta(\vec{v})=g(\vec{t},\vec{v})$ for all tangent vectors $\vec{v}$. Note that $\beta(\vec{n})=0$. Following the integral curves of $\vec{t}$ allows one to construct a diffeomorphism relating the different $\Sigma_t$. Then one can interpret the lapse as measuring the proper time between different slices $\Sigma_t$, and $\beta$ as measuring the relative velocity of observers that follow the normal $\vec{n}$ and those that follow $\vec{t}$. The Einstein equations can be decomposed with respect to a regular slicing, yielding evolution and constraint equations. Different gauge choices – that is, different choices of $\vec{t}$ - are used by relativists to produce different decompositions that have favourable mathematical properties, usually relating to the particular flavour of hyperbolicity of the evolution equations. So lapse and shift certainly both carry meaning, but neither is canonically defined inasmuch as they depend upon the choice of $\vec{t}$. The regular sliced form of the metric is indeed natural, in that it arises as described above once one has identified a global time coordinate on the spacetime. Added: This attempts to answer the first question(s). I don't think that there is a better response to the second question - a slick way of calculating the Christoffel symbols - than that given by jc. The alternatives are also standard: a direct coordinate calculation or calculation of the connection 1-forms, from which one can read off the Christoffel symbols. Edit: (In response to Anirbit's queries.) First, about the normal 1-form $n$. This is a 1-form field on $M$ that is fixed and smooth once the (smooth) foliation by $\Sigma_t$'s is specified. So there is no choice at this level. The same holds for the form of the 3-metric $g$ on $\Sigma_t$: this is just the spacetime 4-metric $h$ restricted to tangent vectors to $\Sigma_t$: $g=h+n\otimes n$ is just the most convenient way to wite this metric. A key point here is that each $\Sigma_t$ is a 3 dimensional Riemannian manifold, and so the metric $g$ has signature $(+,+,+)$ at each point. That is, at any point the metric $g$ has three positive eigenvalues - where the eigenvectors are tangent to $\Sigma$. This is natural when we take the 3-dim perspective. When we think of $\Sigma_t$ as being embedded in $M$, and allow $g$ to act on any tangent vector of $M$, we'd say that the signature is $(0,+,+,+)$. The zero eigenvalue corresponds to $n$. Now we step down one more dimension to consider a spatial 2-surface $S$ embedded in $\Sigma_t$. A typical example is a 2-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^3$ considered as a slice $t=$constant of Minkowski spacetime. The normal $m$ is a spacelike vector orthogonal to $n$. Again, the metric of $S$ is inherited naturally (no choice!) and has the convenient form $g^\prime = h+n\otimes n - m\otimes m$. The minus sign arises to make sure we get the right signature $(0,0,+,+)$ for $g^\prime$: without this signature - and without the minus sign - we would not have a Riemannian metric for $S$. The source of the sign difference is that $n$ is timelike, but $m$ is spacelike. 

Let $p$ be an odd prime (large if it matters) and let $G= Aff(\mathbb{F}_{p^2}) \cong \mathbb{F}_{p^2} \rtimes \mathbb{F}_{p^2}^*$ be the affine linear group acting on $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ by $x\mapsto ax+b$, $a\in \mathbb{F}_{p^2}^*$ and $b\in\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$. Consider the $\mathbb{F}_2$-representation $V=\{f\colon\mathbb{F}_{p^2}\to \mathbb{F}_2\}$ of $G$ with the action $f(x)\mapsto f(ax+b)$. There are 4 invariant subspaces that I can easily find, namely the two trivial ones, the constant functions, and the space of $f$ with $\sum_{x} f(x)=0$. Are there any more invariant subspaces? 

A trivial application: The group $(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})^n$ is generated by no less than $n$ elements. [Probably this is the easiest way to prove that the free profinite group on $n$ letters cannot be topologically generated by less elements. And more abstractly, it is in general hard to find the minimal number of generators of a group, UNLESS it has a vector space quotient, and then we have dimension theory of vector spaces.] 

Landau proved that the mean density of integers of the form $a^2+b^2$ up to $x$ is $K\frac{x}{\sqrt{\log x}} (1+o(1))$, where $K$ is an explicit constant. One proof is based on the fact that a prime $p$ is of this form iff $p\neq 3\mod 4$, and so we can express the generating function for these integers in terms of the zeta function and the $L$-function of the non-trivial character modulo $4$. From there one proceed using complex analysis. For integers of the form $a^2 + nb^2$, one should have similar results. We know what primes has this form by class field theory, and then in principle one can continue as before. I am sure this is classical, but unfortunately I've failed to find it in the literature (including google). Does anyone know a reference for this? 

Theorem: Every bounded differential function $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is constant. Proof. By assumption there exist real numbers $M,N$ such that $$N\leq f(x) \leq M.$$ Taking derivatives we get $$0\leq f'(x)\leq 0.$$ Hence $f'(x)=0$ so $f$ is constant. QED 

Let $N(x)$ be the number of positive integers $n\leq x$ such that $\gcd(n,\phi(n))=1$. Here $\phi(n)$ is the Euler totient function. A theorem of Erdos from 1948 says that $$ N(x) \sim \frac{e^{-C_0} x}{\log\log\log x},\quad x\to \infty, $$ where $C_0$ is the Euler constant. See also Theorem 11.23 in Montgomery-Vaughan's "Multiplicative number theory". Erdos quotes a result of Szele saying that these numbers are exactly those $n$ for which there is exactly one abstract group of order $n$. My question is whether there is a deeper, or more enlightening, reason to count such integers?
