This is really a comment, but I need a bit more space. If $\phi$ is a sentence of ${\cal L}_{\omega_1,\omega}$ that is $\aleph_0$-categorial, there is a complete first order theory $T$ in an expanded vocabulary such that the models of $\phi$ are exactly the reducts atomic models of $\phi$. The expansion is done in such a way that two structures will be isomorphic in the original language if and only if they are isomorphic in the expanded language. So your question is really the same as: For $\phi$ a sentence of ${\cal}L_{\omega_1,\omega}$ is ``$\phi$ is $\kappa$-categorical for all infinite $\kappa$" absolute? This is, as far as I know, still an open question. It is also open if ``$\phi$ is $\aleph_1$-categorical" is absolute. John Baldwin in his paper ``Amalgamation, Absoluteness, and Categoricity" addresses some issues around this. Here is a link $URL$ 

The classical example is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ sets of reals. We say that $X\subset \mathbb R$ is ${\mathbf\Pi}^1_1$ if the complement of the projection of a Borel set in ${\mathbb R}^n$. Any such set of cardinality greater than $\aleph_1$ has cardinality continuum. 

We will always have ${\rm ZF}^M\supseteq {\rm ZF}$. The problem comes if $M$ contains nonstandard sentences--which is equivalent to the question of whether $M$ contains nonstandard natural numbers since we can identify formulas with their Godel codes. If there are no nonstandard integers, then they type of externl induction you are doing works fine, but if there aren't it might break down at a nonstandard stage. 

If everything takes place in the category of compactly generated spaces, it holds $$\pi_0(BC)=\pi_0(obC)/\tilde{},$$ where two path components in the object space get identified, if there are objects in each of them respectively which are connected by a morphism in the category and $\tilde{}$ is the equivalence relation generated by that. This follows from Lemma 11.11 in Peter May's 'The Geometry of Iterated Loop Spaces', in which the more general claim for simplicial spaces is proven. 

I am trying to better understand these two claims. Lawson and Michelson simply write in their book "Spin Geometry", that (2) follows from "deep work of Adams and Milnor". Since I am absolutely not an expert in this field, can someone elaborate a bit (more than "It follows from the work of Adams and Milnor.", what is not really helpful for me.) on what I really need to prove (2) and how one can place it in a wider context? How can one prove (1) and is there a reference for it? I searched the literature without good results, so simply giving references might also answer my question. 

Yes, there a lots of them. The topological tangent bundle $\tau$ of any topological non-smoothable manifold $M$ gives you an example since a vector bundle reduction of $\tau$ is by smoothing theory equivalent to a smoothing of $M$. 

The classical argument Andres mentions can be taken one step further to show that if every uncountable $\Pi_1^1$ set contains a perfect subset then $\aleph_1$ is inaccessible in $L$. This follows from the same fact for $\Sigma^1_2$-sets since, by the uniformization theorem, every $\Sigma^1_2$-set is the injective projection of a $\Pi^1_1$-set. 

Another way to do this is to use the Hensel-Rychlick version of Hensel's Lemma. This says that if you have $f\in {\mathbb Z}_p[X]$ and $a\in{\mathbb Z}_p$ such that $v(f(a))>2v(f^\prime(a))$, then $f$ has a zero in ${\mathbb Z}_p$. As in Jerome's answer we can find an integer $n$ such that $x=n+p^3\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a unit. Let $f(X)=X^p-{x\over n}$. Then $v(f(1))=3$ while $v(f^\prime(1))=1$. Thus $x\over n$ has a $p$-th root. Indeed, the Hensel-Rychlick Lemma says you can find a zero $c$ with $v(c-a)\ge v(f(a))-v(f^\prime(a))$. 

Pillay and Scanlon gave an example showing Morley rank isn't definable in elementary extensions in: Compact complex manifolds with the DOP and other properties, J. Symbolic Logic, vol. 67 (2002), pp. 737–743. In a different direction Dale Radin showed the you do have definability of dimension in the standard model in: A definability result for compact complex spaces. J. Symbolic Logic vol. 69 (2004), pp. 241–254. 

I think the answer is no, but let me first give a precise version of the question (which I think Daniel's argument doesn't quite address). Fix some reasonable listing $P_0,P_1,\dots$ of recursively enumerable sets of polynomials. [See below for a ``reasonable" coding.] I claim that there is no algorithm to determine if $V(P_e)=\emptyset$. Let $K$ be the diagonal halting set. Namely, $K=$ {$e$: the $ e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $e$}. For each $e$ let $P_e=\{p_0,p_1,\dots\}$ be the recursively enumerable sequence of polynomials where $p_i=0$ if the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine has not halted by stage $i$ and $p_i=1$ if has. Then $V(P_e)=\emptyset \Leftrightarrow e\in K$. Since $K$ is undecidable there is no algorithm to decide if $V(P_e)$ is empty. One way to code sequences of polynomials would be to let $q_0,q_1,\dots$ list all polynomials, and let $P_e$ be {$q_i:$ the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $i$}. To get to Ian's setting we could view $P_e$ as the sequence $p_0,p_1,\dots$ where $p_{(i,j)\}$ is 0 unless the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input i at stage $j$ in which case it is $q_i$ and $(i,j)$ is some computable pairing function. 

Let $M$ and $W$ be smooth manifolds (possibly with boundary) and $V\subseteq W$ a submanifold. We have a map between embedding spaces $$Emb(W,M)\rightarrow Emb(V,M)$$ given by restriction. Richard Palais proved around 1960 that if all manifolds have no boundary, $V$ is compact and the embedding spaces are equipped with the weak Whitney $C^{\infty}$-topology, then this is a fiber bundle, in particular a Serre fibration. (The path-lifting property of the fibration reflects the isotopy extension theorem.) In conclusive remarks (section 6 of the cited paper), he mentions that the result is also true allowing $W$ and $V$ to have boundary but still insisting on $V$ being compact and $M$ having no boundary. It is said that these results will appear, among others, in a joint paper with Morris Hirsch. It seems to me that this paper was never published. 

I'm unsure whether this question is appropriate for mathoverflow, so feel free to criticize. All manifolds are closed, smooth and have dimensions $n\ge 5$. The Atiyah-Shapiro-Bott-Orientation gives a ring homomorphism $$\alpha\colon\Omega_*^{spin}\rightarrow KO^{-*}(pt),$$ from the spin-bordism ring to real K-theory, whose vanishing is a necessary condition for a spin manifold admitting a metric of positive scalar curvature. Recall $$KO^{-n}(pt)\cong \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} &\mbox{if } n \equiv 0,4 (8)\\ \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} & \mbox{if } n \equiv 1,2(8) \\ 0 &\mbox{if } n \equiv 3,5,6,7 (8). \end{cases}.$$ In dimensions $n\equiv0,4(8)$, $\alpha$ is just the $\hat{A}$-genus (respectively twice of it). Considering the spin-cobordism class of homotopy spheres, the $\alpha$-invariant induces homomorphisms $$\beta_n\colon\Theta_n\rightarrow KO^{-n}(pt),$$ ($\Theta_n$ is the group of $n$-dimensional homotopy spheres), which are zero in dimensions $n\equiv 3,5,6,7 (8)$ for trivial reasons. In the other dimensions, we have 

Wilkie's proof of o-minimality of exponentiation tells you (without needing to assume Schanuel's Conjecture) that for each $k$ there is a bound $M_k$ such that any exponential polynomial $\sum_{i=1}^k c_ie^{\alpha_i x}$ has at most $M_k$ real zeros [assuming that the $c_i$ and $\alpha_i$ are real.] Perhaps Khovanskii's work gives an explicit bound on the $M_k$. 

This was intended to be a comment to SJR's post, but was too long. Here is a proof that any formula that is preserved downwards in models of $T$ is equivalent in $T$ to a universal formula, from which we deduce that formulas preserved upwards are equivalent to existential formulas. Let $T$ be an $\cal L$-theory. Suppose $\phi(\bar v)$ is preserved downwards in models of $T$. Let $\Gamma(\bar v)=\{\psi(\bar v): \psi$ is universal and $T\models \phi(\bar v)\rightarrow \psi(\bar v)\}$. We claim that $T+\Gamma(\bar v)\models \psi(\bar v)$. If that happens then there are $\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n\in\Gamma(\bar v)$ such that $T\models \phi(\bar v)\leftrightarrow (\psi_1(\bar v)\land\dots\land\psi_n(\bar v)$. Suppose not. Then there is ${\cal M}\models T$ and $\bar a\in \cal M$ such that ${\cal M}\models \psi(\bar a)$ for $\psi\in\Gamma$ and ${\cal M}\models \neg\phi(\bar a)$. Let $T_1= T+ \phi(\bar a) + $ atomic diagram of $\cal M$. If $T_1$ is satisfiable there is ${\cal N}\models T$ with ${\cal M}\subset {\cal N}$ and ${\cal N}\models \phi(\bar a)$, contradicting the fact that $\phi$ is preserved downward. Thus $T_1$ must be unsatisfiable. Thus there is a quantifier free formula $\theta(\bar v,\bar w)$ and $\bar b\in \cal M$ such that $$T\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)\rightarrow \neg\phi(\bar a).$$ Since the parameters $\bar a$ and $\bar b$ don't occur in $T$, $$T\models \forall \bar v\ (\phi(\bar v)\rightarrow\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w))$$ But then $\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w)\in \Gamma$ contradicting the fact that ${\cal M}\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)$. 

To avoid leaving this question open: Assuming we work in the category of compactly generated spaces, geometric realization commutes with pullbacks.(It's crucial that we use the compactly generated product.) The proof is basically the same as for simplicial sets. A reference in the space-case is Corollary 11.6 of Peter May's book 'The Geometry of Iterated Loop Space'. The terminal object is preserved as well, so the claim follows by abstract nonsense, since a functor preserves all finite limits iff it preserves pullbacks and the terminal object. 

The mapping class group of a smooth manifold $M$ is the group of all its self diffeomorphisms up to isotopy, i.e. $\pi_0(\operatorname{Diff}(M))\cong \pi_1(B\operatorname{Diff}(M))$. A large portion of geometric topology is concerned with gaining a better understanding of the homotopy type of $B\operatorname{Diff}(M)$, in particular of its cohomology as the latter is the ring of characteristic class of smooth $M$ bundles. In the last 15 years, initiated by Madsen and Weiss' solution of the Mumford conjecture, the understanding of the homology of $B\operatorname{Diff}(M)$ has fundamentally improved which led, among others, to calculations of $H_1(B\operatorname{Diff}(M))\cong \pi_0(\operatorname{Diff}(M))^{ab}$ for some $M$, e.g. by Galatius and Randal-Williams in the following paper.

Let $C$ be a small category and $F\colon C^{op}\rightarrow Set$ a functor. The Grothendieck construction is the category $F\wr C$ with objects being pairs $(c,x)$ where $c$ is a object of $C$ and $x\in F(c)$. An arrow from $(c,x)\rightarrow (c',x')$ is an arrow $f\colon c\rightarrow c'$ with $F(f)(x')=x$. This comes with a natural functor $F\wr C\rightarrow C$ forgetting the second coordinate. In other words it is a category $F\wr C$ together with a functor $F\wr C\rightarrow C$, such that the diagram of nerves $$ \newcommand{\ra}[1]{\kern-1.5ex\xrightarrow{\ \ #1\ \ }\phantom{}\kern-1.5ex} \newcommand{\ras}[1]{\kern-1.5ex\xrightarrow{\ \ \smash{#1}\ \ }\phantom{}\kern-1.5ex} \newcommand{\da}[1]{\bigg\downarrow\raise.5ex\rlap{\scriptstyle#1}} \begin{array}{c} N_1(F\wr C) & \ra{d_0} & N_o(F\wr C) \\ \da{} & & \da{} \\ N_1(C) & \ra{d_0} & N_o(C) \end{array} $$ is cartesian. Now topologize the whole situation, i.e. let $C$ be a topological category (a category internal to $Top$) and $F\colon C^{op}\rightarrow Top$ a functor. The grothendieck construction of this situation should give me a topological category $F\wr C$ with a continuous functor $F\wr C\rightarrow C$, such that the diagram above is cartesian. However, I ran into difficulties making this precise. Taking the non-topological definition for the underlying sets $ob(F\wr C)$ and $mor(F\wr C)$, one can topologize the set of morphisms as subspace of $mor(C)$, but what is the right topology on $ob(F\wr C)$? In some situations, the way to go is obvious :
