I will present a triangulation of $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$. More specifically, I will give an explicit regular CW structure on $\mathbb{CP}^{n-1}$. As spinorbundle says, the first barycentric subdivision of a regular CW complex is a simplicial complex homeomorphic to the original CW complex. 

I will assume all $p_i$ are strictly between $0$ and $1$. Lemma We can use a coin with probability $p$ of coming up heads to emulate a coin with probability $p/(1+p)$ of coming up heads. Proof Flip the coin until it first comes up tails. The emulated coin is declared to be heads if we have flipped an even number of times. The emulated coin comes up heads with probability $$p(1-p) + p^3(1-p) + p^5(1-p) + \cdots = \frac{p(1-p)}{1-p^2} = \frac{p}{1+p}. \quad \square$$ Set $q_i = p_i/(1+p_i)$. So we may assume we have coins with probability of heads $q_k$. Flip all coins until exactly one coin comes up heads, and select the corresponding $k$. Let $S$ be the probability that not precisely one coin comes up heads. The probability of picking $k$ is $$q_k \prod_{j \neq k} (1-q_j) + S q_k \prod_{j \neq k} (1-q_j) + S^2 q_k \prod_{j \neq k} (1-q_j) + \cdots = \frac{q_k \prod_{j \neq k} (1-q_j)}{1-S}.$$ So the ratio of the probability of picking $k$ and the probability of picking $\ell$ is $$\frac{q_k/(1-q_k)}{q_{\ell}/(1-q_{\ell})}= \frac{p_k}{p_{\ell}}.$$ Since the probabilities must add up to $1$, the probability of picking $k$ is $p_k$. 

$M_5$ is pretty big. I'll do $M_3$, which should get across the same points. In $M_3$, there are two strata: The hyperelliptic locus, $H$, consists of those curves which have a degree $2$ map to $\mathbb{P}^1$. The planar biquadrics, $B$, consist of curves which can be embedded in $\mathbb{P}^2$ with degree $4$. Such a curve has many different degree $3$ maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$; projection from any of its points gives such a map. Every curve in $M_3$ is in precisely one of $B$ and $H$. There are several points I want to make: (a) The topology on $M_3$ is not the disjoint union of $B$ and $H$. Rather, $B$ is dense and open in $M_3$, and $H$ is a hypersurface. (b) There is no notion of "the defining equation" of a curve. The curves in $B$ can be embedded in $\mathbb{P}^2$ by degree $4$ equations; but they can also be embedded in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with various larger degrees and they can be embedded in the plane with higher degrees if you allow nodes. The issue is more dramatic for curves in $B$. They can be embedded in $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1$, with degree $(2,4)$. To embed them in $\mathbb{P}^2$, you have to allow nodes (or worse singularities); I'm not sure what the lowest degree you can get away with is there. (c) It is interesting to see how a curve in $B$ degenerates to a hyperelliptic curve. Let $F_t$ be a family of degree $4$ curves in $\mathbb{P}^2$, parameterized by $t$ in a disc $\Delta$. Let $C \to \Delta \setminus \{ 0 \}$ be the corresponding family of abstract curves, and suppose the limit in $M_3$ as $t \to 0$ is a hyperelliptic curve. If we normalize things properly, we can take $F_0 = Q^2$ for a conic $Q$. Let $F_t = Q^2 + t G + \cdots$. Let $\Delta'$ be the branched cover $t=u^2$ of $\Delta$. Then we can complete the family $C' \to \Delta' \setminus \{ 0 \}$ to a family $\tilde{C} \to \Delta'$ whose fiber over $0$ is the hyperelliptic curve in question. The family $\tilde{C}$ maps to $\mathbb{P}^2$. For $u \neq 0$, the curve $C'_u$ maps to $\{ F_{u^2}=0 \}$. At $u=0$, the hyperelliptic curve double covers $Q$, ramified over the $8$ points $\{ Q=G=0 \}$. (d) Similarly, we can take a family of genus $3$ curves with degree $3$ maps to $\mathbb{P}^1$ and take the limit of that family, in the sense of stable maps. I'm finding this limit a bit difficult. I think you get a curve with two components, $X \cup Y$, glued along a single node; where $X$ is hyperelliptic of genus $3$ and double covers $\mathbb{P}^1$ while $Y$ is genus $0$ and maps isomorphically to $\mathbb{P}^1$. 

First some minor changes. It will be convenient to clear out denominators and work with $\log \left( 4 + e^{2 \pi i x} + e^{- 2 \pi i x} + e^{2 \pi i y} + e^{- 2 \pi i y} \right)$. That just changes the constant term of your Fourier series by $\log 2$. Next, it is convenient to focus on $$ \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \log \left( 4 + e^{2 \pi i x} + e^{- 2 \pi i x} + e^{2 \pi i y} + e^{- 2 \pi i y} \right) e^{2 \pi i m x} e^{2 \pi i n y} dx dy.$$ A simple linear transformation goes between this and the cosine formulation. Let $S = \{ (z,w) : |z|=|w|=1 \}$. So we are dealing with $$\frac{1}{(2 \pi i )^2} \int_S \log \left( 4+z+z^{-1} + w +w^{-1} \right) z^{m-1} w^{n-1} dz dw.$$ Dropping out the $4 \pi ^2$, we want to show the integrand is of the form $a \pi + b$. UPDATE: Thanks to fedja for pointing out that I had oversimplified the next paragraph. Assuming that $(m,n) \neq (0,0)$, we can integrate by parts with respect to one of the two variables, let's say $z$. Once we do that, we will have a quantity of the form $$ (\mbox{rational number}) \cdot \int_S \frac{(z-z^{-1}) w^k z^{\ell} dw dz} {4+w+w^{-1}+z+z^{-1}}$$ So we'd like to show this quantity is of the form $a+b \pi$. As fedja points out, we need to be careful here. Without the $z-z^{-1}$ term, the integral diverges like $\int \int ds dt/(s^2 + t^2)$ near $(-1,-1)$. 

The first three have fixed points, and the last doesn't. Putting it all together, the probability that an element in $PGL_2(\FF_r)$ has a fixed point is $(r+2)/(2r+2)$. 

$\def\Ext{\mathrm{Ext}}$I have the following situation: I have a complex algebraic variety $X$. I want to compute the weight filtration on various abelian covers $Y \to X$. As a concrete example, take $X = \mathbb{A}^2 \setminus \{ (x_1, x_2) : x_1 x_2 = 1 \}$ and let $Y_{\ell}$ be the cover where we adjoin an $\ell$-th root of $x_1 x_2 - 1$. Topologically, $X$ retracts onto the locus $\{ |x_1| = |x_2|,\ |x_1 x_2-1| = 1 \}$, which is a pinched $2$-sphere, and $Y_{\ell}$ retracts onto a "necklace" of $\ell$ $2$-spheres. One can compute that $Y_{\ell}$ has betti numbers $(1,1,\ell)$ with $H^1$ in weight $2$, and $H^2$ splitting up into one piece in weight $4$ and the rest in weight $2$. See Section 7.1 of this paper for the details. It is natural to organize our data in the following way. Let $A = H_1(X, \mathbb{Z})$, so abelian covers of $X$ come with an action of $A$. For any character $\chi$ of $A$, let $H^{p, \chi}(X)$ be the $\chi$ component of $H^{\ast}(Y, \mathbb{C})$ where $Y$ is any abelian cover of $X$ such that the image of $H_1(Y)$ in $H_1(X)$ is contained in $\mathrm{Ker}(A)$. This is unaltered by passing to a larger cover $Z$ since, for any finite $G$-cover $Z \to Y$, we have $H^{\ast}(Y, \mathbb{C}) \cong H^{\ast}(Z, \mathbb{C})^G$. Moreover, it is well defined to speak of the weight filtration on $H^{\ast, \chi}(X, \mathbb{C})$. In the above example, $H^{0,0} = H^{1,0} = \mathbb{C}$, in weights $0$ and $2$; $H^{2,\chi}$ is one dimensional for all $\chi$, with weight $4$ if $\chi$ is trivial and weight $2$ otherwise. I was talking with a topologist, and he told me I should organize the data as follows (errors in this are my own). Let $R$ be the group algebra $\mathbb{C}[A]$. Let $X^{ab}$ be the universal abelian cover of $X$ and let $M_p = H_p(X^{ab}, \mathbb{C})$. Then $M_p$ is an $R$-module called the Alexander module, and it is finitely generated. Let $L_{\chi}$ be $\mathbb{C}$ considered as an $R$-module where $A$ acts by $\chi$. Then there is a spectral sequence relating $H^{\ast,\chi}$ and $\Ext^{\ast}_R(M_{\ast}, L_{\chi})$. (This is basically the universal coefficient theorem.) In the example I gave, $A = \mathbb{Z}$ so $R$ is the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[z^{\pm}]$. The abelian cover $X^{ab}$ is an infinite chain of spheres so $H_0$ is one dimensional, $H_1$ vanishes and $H_2 \cong \mathbb{C}^{\infty}$. As $R$-modules, we have $M_0 \cong L_1 \cong R/(z-1)$, $M_1 = 0$ and $M_2 \cong R$. We have $$\Ext^0(M_0, L_{\chi}) = \Ext^1(M_0, L_{\chi}) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{C} & \chi = 1 \\ 0 & \chi \neq 1 \end{cases}$$ and $$\Ext^0(M_2, L_{\chi}) \cong \mathbb{C}$$ for all $\chi$. So this predicts the dimensions exactly. But what extra data on $M_2$ do I need to see that $\Ext^0(M_2, L_1)$ is in weight $4$, while $\Ext^0(M_2, L_{\chi})$ is in weight $2$ for all other $\chi$? 

I'm finding signs difficult tonight, so I'll only get my formulas right up to a sign. We start with the following observation. Let $f$ be a polynomial of degree $n$. Then $$\mathrm{Disc} ( f(x) (x-1)) = f(1)^2 \mathrm{Disc} (f(x)) \quad (*)$$ To see this, let $r_1$, $r_2$, ..., $r_n$ be the roots of the polynomial $f$ and remember that $\mathrm{Disc}(f) = \prod_{i < j} (r_i-r_j)^2.$ Now, recall the identity $$\mathrm{Disc}(x^{n+1}-ax+b) = \left( (n+1)^{n+1} b^n - n^n a^{n+1} \right).$$ It is easy to check that the right hand side vanishes if and only if $x^{n+1}-ax+b$ has a root in common with its derivative $(n+1)x^n-a$, so the two sides agree up to a constant. Checking the constant is left as an exercise. Plugging in $a=b+1$, we get $$\mathrm{Disc}(x^{n+1}-(b+1)x+b) = \left( (n+1)^{n+1} b^n - n^n (b+1)^{n+1} \right).$$ Applying $(*)$ to the identity $x^{n+1}-(b+1)x+b = (x-1)(x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+x^2+x-b)$, we get $$\mathrm{Disc}(x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+x^2+x-b) = \frac{ (n+1)^{n+1} b^n - n^n (b+1)^{n+1} }{(n-b)^2}.$$ Taking the limit as $b \to n$, and using l'Hospital twice, we get $$\mathrm{Disc}(x^n+x^{n-1}+\cdots+x^2+x-n) =$$ $$ (-1)^{\binom{n+1}{2}} \frac{ (n+1)^{n+1} n (n-1) n^{n-2} - n^n (n+1) n (n+1)^{n-1} }{2}$$ $$= \frac{ (n+1)^n n^{n-1} \left( (n+1)(n-1) - n^2 \right) }{2} = \frac{ (n+1)^n n^{n-1} }{2}$$ Now, applying $(*)$ once more, we get $$\mathrm{Disc}(x^{n-1} + 2 x^{n-2} + \cdots + (n-1) x + n )$$ $$ \frac{ (n+1)^n n^{n-1} }{2} \ \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right)^{-2} = 2 (n+1)^{n-2} n^{n-3}.$$ 

No. $$x_1+x_2 \leq 1 \quad y_1 + y_2 \leq 1 \quad z_1 + z_2 \leq 1$$ $$x_1+y_1+z_1 \leq 2 \quad x_2+y_2+z_1 \leq 2 \quad x_2+y_1+z_2 \leq 2 \quad x_1 + y_2 + z_2 \leq 2$$ $$(1,1,1,1,1,1) \in 2 P.$$ Note that the first three inequalities imply $x_1+x_2+y_1+y_2+z_1+z_2 \leq 3$. If we are to sum up two such points and get a point whose coordinates sum to $6$, then the two points of $P$ must have $$x_1+x_2+y_1+y_2+z_1+z_2 = 3.$$ So we will add this equality to our list of relations. Together with this linear inequality, the first line of inequalities cuts out a cube. Projecting onto the $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ coordinates, it is $[0,1]^3$. The second line of inequalities gives a tetrahedron whose vertices are four non-adjacent vertices of the cube. Projecting onto $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ again, we are talking about $(0,0,0)$, $(1,1,0)$, $(1,0,1)$ and $(0,1,1)$. Since $x_1+y_1+z_1$ is even for all integer points in $P$, it is impossible for $(1,1,1,1,1,1)$ to be the sum of two such points. The tetrahedron formed by nonadjacent vertices of a cube is the standard example of a non-integrally closed polytope with integer vertices; I just had to figure out how to embed it in inequalities of the form you gave. 

This is a first order statement which has been constructed to be true in $\mathbb{R}^{alg}$. So it is also true in $\mathbb{R}$, and we see that $A$ is the $r$-th root of $f$ in $\mathbb{R}$. Thus, $A = A^{alg}$, as claimed. 

No. Let $x_1$ divide $p(x)$ with multiplicity $k$. Since $p$ switches sign when crossing from the $+++\cdots+$ quadrant to the $-+++\cdots+$ quadrant, $k$ is odd. But, since $p$ doesn't switch sign when crossing from $+-++\cdots+$ to $--++\cdots+$, we see that $k$ is also even. Contradiction. I feel like this question has appeared here before. 

It is easy enough to build the tree from a definition 2 description. Here is a sketch: Suppose that SP graph $G$ occurs from subdividing graph $G'$ at an edge $e$, either in series or in parallel. Recursively, let $T'$ be the tree for $G'$. Then $e$ is a leaf of $T'$. Add two children below that leaf. Mark the node $e$ as either series or parallel according to whether the subdivision of $e$ was series or parallel. I don't know what the efficiency of this is; it probably depends on your precise implementation of trees. And I don't know any references in the literature. 

I'm going to take the opportunity to advertise one of my results: A number of people have said to me "I always thought there was something $K$-theoretic about the Tutte polynomial". Alex Fink and I have worked out the details. Let $x$ be a point in the Grassmannian $G(d,n)$. Let $T$ be the torus of diagonal matrices in $GL_n$, and let $Z$ be the closure of $Tx$. Let $\mathcal{O}_Z$ be the structure sheaf of $Z$ and let $\mathcal{O}(1)$ be the Pucker line bundle on $G(d,n)$. Let $\mathbb{P}$ be the projective space lines in $\mathbb{C}^n$, let $\mathbb{P}^{\vee}$ be the projective space of hyperplanes in $\mathbb{C}^n$, and let $F \subset \mathbb{P} \times G(d,n) \times \mathbb{P}^{\vee}$ be the space of partial flags of dimension $(1,d,n-1)$. Pushing and pulling from $F$ gives a map $\phi: K_0(G(d,n)) \to K_0(\mathbb{P} \times \mathbb{P}^{\vee}) \cong \mathbb{Z}[t,u]/\langle t^n, u^n \rangle$. Then $\phi([\mathcal{O}_Z \otimes \mathcal{O}(1)])$ is the Tutte polynomial of the matroid $M$ of $x$. To see a baby case of this, let $\int$ denote the pushforward to $K_0(\mathrm{pt}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. The projection formula gives us $\int \circ \phi = \int$. Now, $\int \mathcal{O}_Z(1)$ is the dimension of global sections of the Plucker line bundle restricted to $Z$. The Plucker coordiante $p_I$ is zero on $Z$ if and only if $I \not \in M$, and there are no other relations, so $\int \mathcal{O}_Z(1)$ is the number of bases of $M$. On the other hand, $\int : K_0(\mathbb{P} \times \mathbb{P}^{\vee}) \to \mathbb{Z}$ sends $t$ and $u$ to $1$. So this result includes the basic fact that the Tutte polynomial, evaluated at $(1,1)$, is the number of bases of the matroid. Alex and I suggest that $\phi([\mathcal{O}_Z \otimes \mathcal{O}(k)])$ might be an interesting matroid invariant for other values of $k$. 

I also have a direct proof of Mittag-Leffler for $H^q(M_0) \leftarrow H^q(M_1) \leftarrow \cdots$. Lemma Let $M$ be a manifold (PL or better) and let $K$ be a compact subset of $M$. Then $H^q(M) \to H^q(K)$ has finite dimensional image. Proof Take a PL triangulation of $M$. For each face $\sigma$ of the triangulation, let $U_{\sigma}$ be the union of the relative interiors of those faces $\tau$ containing $\sigma$. So the $U_{\sigma}$ form an open cover of $M$. As $K$ is compact, it can be covered by finitely many $U_{\sigma}$. Let $N$ be the union of the closures of those $U_{\sigma}$. So $K \subset N$ and $H^q(M) \to H^q(K)$ factors through $H^q(N)$. But $N$ is a finite simplicial complex, so $H^q(N)$ is finite dimensional. $\square$ Remark Actually, the union of the $U_{\sigma}$ also has finite cohomology, without taking the closure, but I didn't see a one line way of saying it. Now, let $M_0 \subset M_1 \subset M_2 \subset \cdots$ be an ascending chain of manifolds, with the closure $\overline{M_i}$ (in $M_{i+1}$) compact. Then $H^q(M_{i+1}) \to H^q(M_i)$ factors through $H^q(\overline{M}_i)$, so it has finite dimensional image. For each $j \geq i+1$, the image of $H^q(M_j)$ lies in that finite dimensional image. So the Mittag-Leffler condition holds and $\lim_{\infty \leftarrow j}^1 H^q(M_j)=0$. 

Warning: this part of the answer was written without access to my usual number theory references, so there may be errors. It isn't meant to be read by itself anyway; it is meant to be a guide to a good book on algebraic number theory, like Neukirch or Janusz. How you should approach a question like this Your fundamental strategy to be to relate the order of ramification of $p$ in $L$ and in the Galois closure of $L$. This does not precisely determine the power of $p$ dividing the discriminant, but we have the following Fact: Let $L/K$ be an extension of number fields and $p$ a prime of $K$ with ramification indices $e_1$, $e_2$, ... $e_r$ and residue field extensions of degree $f_1$, $f_2$, ..., $f_r$. Then the power of $p$ dividing $D_{L/K}$ is at least $\sum (e_i-1) f_i$, with equality if and only if all the $e_i$ are less than relatively prime to the characteristic of $p$. From now on, I will address the question of how to relate the orders of ramification in $L$ and in the Galois closure. If you need to deal with the case that some of the $e_i$ are greater than or equal to the characteristic of $p$, you should read about higher ramification groups. Let $M$ be the Galois closure of $L$, let $G$ be $\mathrm{Gal}(M/K)$, and let $H$ be the fixed field of $L$. Fix a prime $p$ of $K$, and1 $\mathfrak{p}$ a prime over $p$. Let $D \subseteq G$ be the decomposition group of $\mathfrak{p}$ and $I \subset D$ the inertia group. $I$ is normal in $D$; the quotient $D/I$ is cyclic and has a canonical generator $F$ called the Frobenius. I believe that FC's computation was for the case $G=S_n$, $D=I=\{ e, (12) \}$. In $M$, the primes lying over $p$ are in bijection with $G/D$. Each of them has $f=|D/I|$ and $e=|I|$. Let $X=G/H$ (a set with $G$-action). In $L$, the primes above $p$ are in bijection with the $D$-orbits in $X$. Let $O$ be such a $D$-orbit, corresponding to a prime $q_O$. Because $I$ is normal, $O$ breaks up as a union of $I$-orbits all of the same cardinality. Then $q_O$ has $e$ equal to the cardinality of these $I$-orbits, and $f$ equal to the number of them. Using these ideas, you should be able to relate ramification in $L$ and $M$ for any $G$ and $H$ which interest you. 1 I fix $\mathfrak{p}$ only for expositional purposes. Changing $\mathfrak{p}$ will conjugate $(D,I,F)$. Probably the right way to think of all of this stuff is working up to conjugacy.
