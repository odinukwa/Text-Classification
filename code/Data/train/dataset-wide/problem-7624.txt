In his unpublished article, Combinatorial properties of triangulations of oriented matroids, Julian Webster proves that every triangulation of an oriented matroid is partitionable. Does this result appear somewhere in the published literature? If so, where? Edits: 

This is Corollary 10.1.4 in Oxley. Lenz gives a good account in Section 7 of On Powers Of Pl√ºcker Coordinates And Representability Of Arithmetic Matroids. 

Metric dimension is well-defined The usual definition of metric dimension (and the one initially given in the OP) is the smallest cardinality of any metric basis. This generalizes the notion for metric dimension in graphs and is well-defined for any metric space (finite or not). To see this let $(M,d)$ be a metric space and $\mathcal{G}$ be the collection of metric generating sets. There are two natural posets one can define on $\mathcal{G}$: let $P_1 = (\mathcal{G}, |\cdot|)$ be defined by $G \prec G'$ if $|G| < |G'|$ and let $P_2 = (\mathcal{G}, \subset)$ be defined by $G \prec G'$ if $G \subset G'$. Note that the minimal elements of $P_1$ are the metric bases $\mathcal{B}(M,d)$. Also notice that the metric bases are contained in the minimal elements of $P_2$ and that this containment is generally strict. Metric Bases and Matroids Fix a metric space $(M,d)$ where $M$ is a finite set. Let $r$ be the metric dimension of $(M,d)$. Since the metric bases $\mathcal{B}(M,d)$ of $(M,d)$ all have the same cardinality one can ask if and when $\mathcal{B}$ is the set of bases of a matroid. Recall that a collection $\mathcal{B}$ of (finite) sets is the set of bases of a matroid if it satisfies the following exchange axiom: for every $B,B' \in \mathcal{B}$ and every $e \in B$ there is some $f \in B'$ such that the set $B \setminus \{e\} \cup \{f\}$ is also in $B$. First let's see that there are some finite metric spaces whose metric bases are the bases of a matroid. Let $G = (V,E)$ be an undirected connected graph and let $d: V \times V \to \mathbb{N}$ be the map that takes a pair of vertices to the length of the shortest path between them. Then $M(G) := (V,d)$ is a metric space. A simple computation shows the following fact. Fact: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple connected graph with $|V| \le 4$. Then the metric bases of $M(G)$ are the bases of a matroid. This fact does not extend to all graphs with $|V|=5$. To see this consider the graph $G = ([5], \{13,14,15,24,25,35\})$. Then $M(G)$ has 22 metric generating sets and six metric bases $$\mathcal{B}(M(G)) = \{12, 15, 23, 24, 25, 34\}.$$ Notice that for $B = 12$, $e = 2$, and $B'= 34$ there is no element $f \in B'$ such that $B \setminus 2 \cup f$ is also a metric basis. So the metric bases of $M(G)$ are not the bases of any matroid. This graph is unique among simple connected graphs on five vertices in that it is the only one whose metric bases are not matroidal. Let $f(n)$ be the number of the simple connected graphs on $n$ vertices and let $g(n)$ be the number of such graphs whose metric bases are not matroidal. We used these Macaulay2 scripts to compute $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ for $n \le 7$. 

The Schoenflies theorem, as a variant of the well-known Jordan curve theorem, states that the interior and the exterior planar regions determined by a simple closed curve (aka Jordan curve) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (through Jordan curve theorem) are homeomorphic to the interior and exterior of the unit disk respectively. Equivalently, any Jordan curve $\phi : S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$, can be extended to a homeomorphism $\psi : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ of the plane. A closer look at the proof of this theorem suggests that it might be a little bit choicy. This is indeed the case, according to the following result of Sakamoto and Yokoyama: 

Remark 2. Potentially, one may find some questions, related to the possible number/behavior of wild knots of the certain knot invariant (such as bridge, unknotting, stick numbers, etc.) in a forcing extension, interesting. However, for the sake of this question, I preferred to stick to a very specific one concerning crossing number. Please feel free to share your thoughts about other possibly interesting problems along these lines in the comments below. 

As some colleagues asked about the validity of the main result in the following paper in the absence of $\kappa$-cc property for fast function forcing, (with the permission of both authors) I would like to post an answer provided by Arthur in order to clarify the situation: A. Apter, J. Cummings, Blowing up the power set of the least measurable, Journal of Symbolic Logic 67 (2002), no. 3, 915--923. 

Update. According to Ian's remark in the comments section, it turned out that the notion of crossing number for wild knots retains some ambiguity, as (in contrary to the case for tame knots) there is no straightforward theorem guaranteeing the existence of a regular projection for wild knots, which is somehow essential for counting the number of crossing points in a wild knot. Roughly speaking, if you have a wild knot, you can't even be sure how much knotted it is! Another indication of why these crazy creatures deserve the name "wild"! Anyway, the soul of the original question remains valid even without any specification to the case of tame/wild knots of any particular characteristics in terms of knot invariants. The main problem is whether it is possible to add a morphologically new knot to the mathematical universe via forcing. Precisely: 

Let $U$ be the uniform matroid of rank $k$ on $n$. Since $U$ is orientable one can consider the Lawrence oriented matroid $\Lambda(U)$ associated with any orientation of $U$ (the Lawrence construction doesn't care about which orientation you take). Then $M(n,k)$ is precisely the underlying unoriented matroid $\underline{\Lambda(U)}$ of $\Lambda(U)$. Also, the dual matroid $M^*(n,k)$ is a symplectic matroid, which explains why the group $B_n$ acts on the primal. 

Newton polytopes and the polynomials they support We will use the standard notion $\mathbf{x}^{\mathbf{a}} := \prod_{i=1}^{n} x_i^{a_i}$ to represent monomials in a multivariate (Laurent) polynomial ring. The Newton polytope of a polynomial is the convex hull of its exponent vectors. We say that a polytope $P$ supports a polynomial $p$ if $P$ is the Newton polytope of $p$. Example 1: The polytope $\mathrm{conv} \{[0,0]^\top\}$ supports all constant polynomials over any bivariate polynomial ring. More generally, a lattice point $\mathbf{a} \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ supports every polynomial of the form $c_\mathbf{a}\mathbf{x}^\mathbf{a}$ where $c_\mathbf{a}$ is an element of an arbitrary ring. Example 2: The Newton polytopes of the polynomials \begin{align} p &= 2 + 3x^2 - 2y + \frac{1}{2}xy \in \mathbb{Q}[x,y,z] \text{ and }\\ q &= -1 + 8x - x^2 + 5y + xy \in \mathbb{Z}_9[x,y,z] \end{align} both have vertices $V = \{[0,0,0]^\top, [2,0,0]^\top, [0,1,0]^\top, [1,1,0]^\top\}$ and hence coincide. In general we have the following: Fix a (convex) lattice polytope $P \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Then $P$ is the Newton polytope of a polynomial $p$ if and only if $p$ is of the form $\sum_{\mathbf{a} \in P \cap \mathbb{Z}^d} c_\mathbf{a}\mathbf{x}^\mathbf{a}$ such that $c_\mathbf{a} \neq 0$ whenever $\mathbf{a}$ is a vertex of $P$. A note on standard simplices There are two geometric objects typically associated with the term standard $(d-1)$-dimensional simplex: one is the full-dimensional polytope in $\mathbb{R}^{d-1}$ whose vertices consist of the origin together with the $d-1$ standard unit vectors; the other is a codimension one polytope in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose vertices are the $d$ standard unit vectors. Since there is a natural map between these two polytopes that preserves typically relevant polyhedral data, the choice of which definition to use is usually motivated by the problem at hand. In the OP the probability vectors are naturally associated to points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose coordinates sum to $1$, so taking the second view of the standard simplex (as suggested in the OP) seems more natural. The dimension of the product of simplices First we collect some basic facts. The dimension of a polytope is the dimension of its affine span. In particular, the dimension of (the convex hull of) a point is zero. The dimension of a product of polytopes is just the sum of dimensions of the factors. Now, in the computation of the dimension of $\Delta^{(i)}$ in the OP the dimension of $\{0\}$ is $0$ and not $1$. So the dimension of $\Delta^{(i)}$ is $\delta -d_i + 1$, as expected. 

Remark 1. Note that according to the definition, there are no $1$-hyperprime numbers, simply because every natural number greater than $1$ arises as the addition of two smaller natural numbers. $2$-hyperprime numbers are exactly the usual prime numbers and the set of $3$-hyperprime numbers consists of usual primes and numbers like $12$ which don't arise as the exponentiation of two smaller numbers. In general, if $p>1$ is a $m$-hyperprime number for some $m\geq 1$ then it is $n$-hyperprime for any $n>m$. Remark 2. It is intuitively clear that almost all natural numbers are hyperprime in some sense, simply because the hyperoperator $*_n$ gets violently powerful when $n$ grows. Thus for almost any natural number $p>1$ one may find sufficiently large $n$ such that even the smallest combinations of natural numbers like $2*_{n}3$ and $3*_{n}2$ exceed $p$. So based on the increasing nature of hyperoperators, $p$ could not arise as the $*_n$ combination of any smaller numbers and is a $n$-hyperprime number. The only (magical?) exception is the eternally composite number $4$ which is NOT $n$-hyperprime for any $n\geq 1$ because $\forall n\geq 1~~~4=2*_{n}2$. Now the first question is: "How many hyperprimes of any type are there?" We know that there are no $1$-hyperprimes. Also, there are very few $2$-hyperprime numbers in the sense that the natural density of the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ is $0$. Roughly speaking, the usual prime numbers are so rare among natural numbers that one may assume that there is almost no such number! But as stated, there is a promising increasing trend among hyperprime numbers of higher order. When $n$ gets larger and larger, the $n$-hyperoperator skips more and more numbers in its range (while receiving non-trivial input) leaving them as $n$-hyperprimes. Consequently, the corresponding set of $n$-hyperprime numbers gets rapidly larger by varying $n$. So one may cover almost the entire set of natural numbers this way eventually. Thus it is natural to ask: 

Remark. Following Joel's comment below, it is worth mentioning that the above definition is NOT the only variant of fast function forcing. There are other versions with slightly different properties. For a more complete argument along these lines see Joel's answer in this MO post. On one hand, preserving Shelah cardinals through lifting arguments often needs dominating the corresponding functions $f:\kappa\rightarrow \kappa$ by functions in the ground model. On the other hand, we know that the fast function forcing $\mathbb{P}_{\kappa}$ adds a very fast (and so non-dominatable) function of this type into the universe (i.e. the fast function) and simultaneously fails to satisfy $\kappa$-cc property which is a usual condition for providing dominating functions in the ground model.
