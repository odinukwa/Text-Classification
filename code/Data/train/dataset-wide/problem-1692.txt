As pointed out by Rob Jeffries, forming a black hole (BH) from dark matter (DM) is impossible (unless there is a [hypothetical] interaction by which dark-matter can lose energy that evades all detection). Accreting DM into an existing BH is still unlikely (since DM cannot lose its excess energy and angular momentum as easily as gas), but not impossible and a small fraction of matter accreted into the supermassive BHs (SMBHs) at galactic centres was likely dark. However, once matter has accreted into a BH, the information about its origins (dark matter or baryonic) is lost. Therefore, it makes no sense to talk about dark matter black holes: black holes don't have any property beyond their mass, spin, and charge (no-hair theorem). This very property makes primordial black holes interesting as candidates for dark matter, since they would not violate constraints (for example from big-bang nucleosynthesis) about the amount of baryonic matter. However, AKAIK, primordial black holes are out of favour as DM candidates (for reasons beyond the scope of this answer). 

Particles are generated and destroyed all the time. This is obvious for photons, but also holds for massive particles. Today most particles are stable and long-living, but shortly after the big bang the universe was so hot that particle generation and destruction were in some equlibrium and all particles participated in this process (for photons this continued until the epoch of re-ionisation at redshift $z\sim1000$. There is definitely no particle around today that existed all the time since $t=0$. 

The only serious alternative to dark matter is some modification to Einstein's/Newton's theory of gravity. There are several candidates, but none is really convincing (though arguably, dark matter is not too convincing either). 

It doesn't. There are two distinct sources of gravity: internal and external. The internal or self-gravity of the ISM may in fact result in collapse and subsequent star formation, as explained in another answer. The external gravitational attraction from any star or gas cloud on the ISM is too weak to be of relevance and can be neglected, as demonstrated in yet another answer. However, the ISM is subjected to the combined gravitational pull from all stars, gas, and dark matter in the Galaxy, i.e.\ the gravity of the Galaxy itself. In response to this pull, the ISM orbits the Galaxy on near-circular orbits, as do most of the stars (in a disc galaxy such as ours). Thus, the ISM is not special in this respect. Why does the ISM not fall into the inner Galaxy (where it is pulled to)? This is simply because it has too much angular momentum. The situation is exactly the same as for the Earth pulled to the Sun, yet orbiting (nearly) on a circle around it. Finally, note that magnetic forces and radiation pressure from nearby stars are much weaker than Galactic gravity and can be neglected when considering the Galactic orbits of the ISM. 

Astronomers don't and cannot measure distances. Distances are merely inferred from what actually has been measured, such as an angle, a relative luminosity, a time period, etc.. Most astronomical distance determinations ultimately hinge on the Earth-Sun distance (astronomical unit), which therefore is of fundamental importance (and only in modern time is known with good accuracy). For nearby stars, the parallax angle is directly related to the distance, but the distance inferred from that is not a proper measured distance: its uncertainty is not normally distributed (think about a negative parallax measurement). Astronomers know, of course, how many meters a parsec is, and know that using meters for galactic distances is only confusing, because you have to make sure you get the correct number of 0000 all the time (or the correct power of ten). Finally, unlike particle physics, astronomy as a science predates the meter system, at least its wider use. Changing from a well working system to something else only for the sake of conformity with SI, but for the price of inconvenience and confusion seems a stupid idea. 

No. The furthest we can see is the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Early on (after the big bang), matter was fully ionised and the electrons frequently interacted with the photons. That has two consequences. First, the radition was that of a blackbody at the same temperature as the matter. Second, the universe was opaque, i.e. photons couldn't travel very far. Due to the explosive expansion of the universe, the temperature decreased all the time until eventually atoms formed. This is called the epoch of re-combination, though the "re" makes little sense. At that point the universe became suddenly transparent and we can see most radiation emitted ever since. In particular the radiation field from the epoch of recombination has been redshifted and appears to us as the CMB. edit To answer the speculation in the comments what if the universe was not opaque. Well, all we would be able to so is some (nearly) isotropic radiation field emitted very early on (and redshifted by the cosmic expansion since the big bang). The CMB is exactly that, but emitted at redshift $z\sim$1000 (the epoch of re-combination) rather than larger $z$. 

Apart from the good reasons given in the other answers as to why a ball of iron in excess of about $1.4$M$_\odot$ cannot be stable, there is another reason. Namely, there is no way to form that much pure iron. Iron is produced in supernovae, but only a fraction of the matter expelled by a supernova is actually iron and there is no natural way to select is. The remaining matter is locked in the stellar remnant, either a white dwarf, neutron star, or (stellar-mass) black hole. The latter two are already to massive for the material to be in the form of iron, while the a white dwarf may only contain some iron, but never is a ball of iron. 

Your claim that sphericity is assumed is incorrect when referred to hard scientific evidence. Even if that was assumed, the resulting error in the rotation speed is small for spheroidal galaxies and smallish for flat galaxies, provided they are centrally concentrated (which their stellar distribution is). 

change of semimajor axis From the relation $a=-GM/2E$ (with $E=\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{v}^2-GMr^{-1}$ the orbital energy) we have for the change of $a$ due to an external (non-Keplerian) acceleration $$ \dot{a}=\frac{2a^2}{GM}\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a}. $$ Inserting $\boldsymbol{a}$ (note that $\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{v}_t=h^2/r^2$ with angular momentum vector $\boldsymbol{h}\equiv\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{v}$), we get $$ \dot{a}=\frac{2a^2Kh^2}{c^2}\frac{v_r}{r^4}. $$ Since the orbit average $\langle v_r f(r)\rangle=0$ for any function $f$ (see below), $\langle\dot{a}\rangle=0$. change of eccentricity From $\boldsymbol{h}^2=(1-e^2)GMa$, we find $$ e\dot{e}=-\frac{\boldsymbol{h}{\cdot}\dot{\boldsymbol{h}}}{GMa}+\frac{h^2\dot{a}}{2GMa^2}. $$ We already know that $\langle\dot{a}\rangle=0$, so only need to consider the first term. Thus, $$ e\dot{e}=-\frac{(\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{v}){\cdot}(\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{a})}{GMa} =-\frac{r^2\;\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a}}{GMa} =-\frac{Kh^2}{ac^2}\frac{v_r}{r^2}, $$ where I have used the identity $(\boldsymbol{a}\wedge\boldsymbol{b}){\cdot}(\boldsymbol{c}\wedge\boldsymbol{d}) =\boldsymbol{a}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{c}\;\boldsymbol{b}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{d}- \boldsymbol{a}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{d}\;\boldsymbol{b}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{c}$ and the fact $\boldsymbol{r}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a}_p=0$. Again $\langle v_r/r^2\rangle=0$ and hence $\langle\dot{e}\rangle=0$. change of the direction of periapse The eccentricity vector $ \boldsymbol{e}\equiv\boldsymbol{v}\wedge\boldsymbol{h}/GM - \hat{\boldsymbol{r}} $ points (from the centre of gravity) in the direction of periapse, has magnitude $e$, and is conserved under the Keplerian motion (validate all that as an exercise!). From this definition we find its instantaneous change due to external acceleration $$ \dot{\boldsymbol{e}}= \frac{\boldsymbol{a}\wedge(\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{v}) +\boldsymbol{v}\wedge(\boldsymbol{r}\wedge\boldsymbol{a})}{GM} =\frac{2(\boldsymbol{v}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a})\boldsymbol{r} -(\boldsymbol{r}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{v})\boldsymbol{a}}{GM} =\frac{2K}{c^2}\frac{h^2v_r\boldsymbol{r}}{r^4} -\frac{K}{c^2}\frac{v_r^2\boldsymbol{v}_t}{r} $$ where I have used the identity $\boldsymbol{a}\wedge(\boldsymbol{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{c})=(\boldsymbol{a}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{c})\boldsymbol{b}-(\boldsymbol{a}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{b})\boldsymbol{c}$ and the fact $\boldsymbol{r}{\cdot}\boldsymbol{a}=0$. The orbit averages of these expression are considered in the appendix below. If we finally put everything together, we get $ \dot{\boldsymbol{e}}=\boldsymbol{\omega}\wedge\boldsymbol{e} $ with [corrected again] $$ \boldsymbol{\omega}=\Omega K \frac{v_c^2}{c^2} (1-e^2)^{-1}\, \hat{\boldsymbol{h}}. $$ This is a rotation of periapse in the plane of the orbit with angular frequency $\omega=|\boldsymbol{\omega}|$. In particular $\langle e\dot{e}\rangle=\langle\boldsymbol{e}{\cdot}\dot{\boldsymbol{e}}\rangle=0$ in agreement with our previous finding. Don't forget that due to our usage of first-order perturbation theory these results are only strictly true in the limit $K(v_c/c)^2\to0$. At second-order perturbation theory, however, both $a$ and/or $e$ may change. In your numerical experiments, you should find that the orbit-averaged changes of $a$ and $e$ are either zero or scale stronger than linear with perturbation amplitude $K$. disclaimer No guarantee that the algebra is correct. Check it! 

Any gaseous object has some spin, usually acquired by interactions with other objects. For example, (proto-)galaxies torque each other to acquire a low rate of angular momentum. Initially, this spin is rather low in the sense that it does not dominate the dynamics: the energy in rotational motion is small compared to other energies, typically by a factor $\sim100$. However, energy can be lost via dissipation (and ultimately radiated away), while angular momentum (spin) is much harder to get rid off. That's why rotating gaseous objects eventually form a disc-like configuration (galactic and proto-stellar discs). In these discs, the kinetic energy is dominated by the rotation. Such systems can only significantly evolve if angular momentum can be exchanged and/or transported. For example, the formation of a star from a proto-stellar disc is promoted by (outwards) angular-momentum transport within the disc. The newly born star retains some residual spin, but that is no longer dominating its energy (otherwise the star wouldn't be near-spherical by disc-like). The same essentially holds for planets. 

A black hole (BH) never sucks anything in. 'Sucking' requires gas pressure, but a black hole only acts via its gravity. A non-rotating (=Schwarzschild) black hole attracts all massive objects, very much like the Sun attracts the planets. Yet, the planets are not falling into the Sun. This is because the planets move on near-circular orbits when the centrifugal force balances the gravitational attraction. The planets orbital angular momemtum is conserved (because the Solar force field is purely radial [to good approximation]) and these orbits are stable. The difference to a black hole is that very close to the event horizon no such stable circular orbits exist anymore. At those distances, nothing can orbit the BH without falling in. However, an object orbiting a BH on a stable orbit (including passing trajectories) is still subjected to the BH's tidal forces. These distort the object, very much like the Moon's gravity distorts the Earth, generating tides. In case, the trajectory passes sufficiently close to the BH and the object is rather big and fluffy, like (some) stars, the tidal forces may not merely distort the object, but rip it apart. Such tidal disruption of stars must happen if a star passes close to a supermassive BH. This can hardly be directly observed, but the it is thought that some of the stellar matter forms an accretion disc around the BH and produces a characteristic light curve. An observed light curve in agreement with this model is often interpreted as circumstantial evidence for a stellar disruption event.
