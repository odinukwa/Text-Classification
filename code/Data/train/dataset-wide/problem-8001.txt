Daniel Sch√§ppi's answer made me realize that I actually can say something about this. I'll keep Daniel's notation. Something more than what Daniel said is true, and it holds in a more general context: Given that $\mathcal{A}$ has finite limits, $F$ is left exact iff $\mathrm{Lan}_Y YF$ is. This is shown by Kelly (mimic Daniel's argument and use Kelly's Thm 6.11 (i) and (v) to show that a functor $\mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{V}$ is left exact iff its extension is) at the generality of categories enriched in a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed $\mathcal{V}$. This property of the class of finite limits (that if a functor $F$ between categories with finite limits preserves all finite limits, then so does $F_!$) is a weak version of what is called soundness by Adamek, Borceux, Lack, and Rosicky in the $\mathrm{Set}$-enriched context. Other classes of limits which have this property are the class of finite products, and the class of limits indexed by categories with fewer that $\alpha$ morphisms for some fixed regular cardinal $\alpha$. This criterion was used to generalize soundness to the enriched context in Day and Lack and Lack and Rosicky. A related, stronger condition, concerning the exactness of left Kan extensions of functors $F: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{V}$ where $\mathcal{A}$ can be arbitrary, is studied in the enriched context by Dostal and Velebil. One important reason to study soundness is that it allows a theory of categories which are "locally presentable with respect to a class of limits". The classical case of locally $\alpha$-presentable categories is an example (when the class of limits is those indexed by diagrams with $<\alpha$ morphisms), and another example is the theory of (many sorted) Lawvere theories: a category of models of a Lawvere theory is precisely a category which is locally presentable with respect to the class of finite products. In the enriched case especially, there are potentially other interesting examples waiting to be investigated. 

Here's an argument that only trivial such automorphisms exist already for $\overline{k(x,y)}/k$ (note that in this post I don't require the automorphism to fix $\bar k$). It may be similar to the argument in the Evans-Hrushovski paper linked to by Levon Haykazyan; I haven't looked closely. Let $\bar K / k$ have transcendence degree $\geq 2$. Say that $\phi \in Gal(\bar K / k)$ is infinitesimal if it preserves all algebraically-closed subfields. Let $G \subset Gal(\bar K / k)$ be the group of infinitesimal automorphisms. Note that $G$ is normal in $Gal(\bar K / k)$. Lemma: If $\phi \in G$, then $\phi$ has no fixed points outside of $\bar k$. Proof. Assume there is $\phi \in G$ with fixed points outside of $\bar k$. Then we can find $s$ a fixed point and $t$ a non-fixed point with $s,t$ algebraically independent. Let $u = \phi(t) - t$. Then 

I find these conditions to be surprisingly mild and conceptual, compared to the definition of an extensive category, which I find a bit "fussy". I think these are pretty natural and minimal requirements of a category $\mathcal{C}$ to think of it as "a category of commutative modules", and being of the form $\mathrm{Comm}(\mathcal{C})$ for such a $\mathcal{C}$ is a pretty natural requirement for a category to be considered "a category of commutative algebras" -- although admittedly this is probably not the most natural way to think about commutative $C^\ast$-algebras. So the upshot is that any category of commutative algebras is dual to an extensive category, which is a good start toward being "a category of spaces", whatever that means. But I don't know about the reverse direction -- given a "category of spaces", how likely is it to be dual to a category of algebras? This seems tricky, because there are certainly categories of spaces, such as projective varieties, which don't seem to be dual to categories of algebras -- we need to formulate some kind of "affineness criterion" in order to have a shot. Anyway, it is not hard to show that $\mathrm{Comm}(\mathcal{C})$ is co-extensive when $\mathcal{C}$ is as above (it hardly can be, given how "clean" the hypotheses are!): 

The theory of nonconnective derived algebraic geometry is wild / ill-behaved / hard to understand, so one restricts attention to the connective cases which is more tractable. The theory of nonconnective derived algebraic geometry is a straightforward extension of the theory of connective derived algebraic geometry; it is easy to study nonconnective objects in terms of connective covers, but the results are most naturally phrased in terms of the connective objects, so that's the way the theory is expressed. 

Consider the symmetric sequence $P_n = \Delta^{n-1}$ of probability measures on finite sets, with coordinatewise $\Sigma_n$-action. There is a natural topological operad structure on $P$ given by multiplication. That is, 

Sorry to revive an old question, but I can't resist emphasizing the big picture. The question is whether the homotopy groups, considered as functors $\pi_n: \mathrm{HoTop_{*,fin}} \to \mathrm{Set}$, are jointly faithful. This is equivalent to asking whether the product of these functors $\prod_n \pi_n: \mathrm{HoTop_{*,fin}} \to \mathrm{Set}$ is faithful. Not only is this functor not faithful, but Freyd showed that no functor from $\mathrm{HoTop}_{*,fin}$ to $\mathrm{Set}$ can be faithful! The same goes for functors $\mathrm{HoTop}_{fin} \to \mathrm{Set}$, and of course this means there is no faithful functor $\mathrm{HoTop} \to \mathrm{Set}$ or $\mathrm{HoTop}_* \to \mathrm{Set}$. A category admitting a faithful functor to $\mathrm{Set}$ (such as groups, or rings, or chain complexes, or topological spaces at the point-set level, or pretty much any category you know which is not the derived category of something) is called concrete; Freyd's result says that the homotopy category is not concrete. Note that a non-concrete functor can't have a faithful functor to any concrete category! Akhil Mathew has a nice blog post going through the proof of Freyd's result. It comes down to the fact that in the homotopy category you can have a proper class of (suitably generalized) quotient objects, which can't happen in a concrete category. In this context, Freyd's generating hypothesis (as alluded to in Josh Shadlen's answer), implying that the stable homotopy category (of finite spectra) is concrete, is absolutely astounding.(see Eric Wofsey's comment below straightening me out on this) EDIT As pointed out in the comments, the question was actually about finite homotopy types, which form a small category (hence concrete by taking the coproduct of all representables). And Freyd's results really have nothing to say about the faithfulness of the homotopy groups on finite homotopy types. Freyd does show that the homotopy category of finite-dimensional CW complexes is not concrete. So what I said above is only accurate if by $\mathrm{HoTop}_{*,\mathrm{fin}}$ I mean the homotopy category of finite-dimensional CW complexes rather than finite ones. EDIT2 Here's a relation between Freyd's ideas and the non-faithfulness of the homotopy groups on finite CW complexes. Freyd formulates an equivalence relation on morphisms out of an object in a pointed category which generalizes the notion of two morphisms having the same image (namely, $A\to B \sim A \to C$ if for every $X \to A$ one has $X \to B = 0$ iff $X \to C= 0$). This equivalence relation is reflected by any faithful functor $F$, i.e. if $Ff$ and $Fg$ have the same generalized image then $f$ and $g$ have the same generalized image. The map $S^1\times S^1 \to S^2$ crushing the 1-skeleton to a point does not have the same generalized image as a point, but after applying $pi_*$ it does. An equivalence class of maps with the same generalized image can be regarded as a "generalized quotient". Freyd's idea was that in the homotopy category, an object can have a proper class of generalized quotients, which is impossible in a concrete category. For finite CW complexes, we don't have a proper class of generalized quotients, but we can exhibit a nonzero generalized quotient which is sent to zero by the homotopy groups. 

Of course, if you want your cardinals with the tree property to be strongly inaccessible, then you're asking about weakly compact cardinals. But what if you don't want them to be strongly inaccessible? I see it's consistent that no successor cardinal has the tree property. I suspect this means it's consistent that no regular cardinal has the tree property? As a non-set-theorist, I'm not sure whether this question is trivial, or hopeless! 

Here's an outline of a proof that Riehl-Verity (RV) cartesian fibrations are the same as Joyal-Lurie (JL) cartesian fibrations. There are some details that I'm not sure actually hold though. First show that $p: E \to B$ is a JL cartesian fibration iff the cotensor $p^{\Delta^n} : E^{\Delta^n} \to B^{\Delta^n}$ is an RV cartesian fibration for every $n$. In fact, I think that a lift is JL-cartesian iff its degeneracies in $E^{\Delta^n}$ are RV-cartesian for every $n$. Then use Riehl and Verity's Theorem 4.1.10, which says that an isofibration $p: E \to B$ is an RV cartesian fibration iff the induced functor $E\downarrow E \to B \downarrow p$ admits a right adjoint right inverse. Now cotensoring with $\Delta^n$ induces should commute with taking comma categories, and I think (or hope) that it should be 2-functorial on the homotopy 2-category. So if $E\downarrow E \to B \downarrow p$ admits a right adjoint right inverse, then $E^{\Delta^n} \downarrow E^{\Delta^n} \to B^{\Delta^n} \downarrow p^{\Delta^n}$ does too, and so $p^{\Delta^n}: E^{\Delta^n} \to B^{\Delta^n}$ is RV-cartesian, and $p$ is JL cartesian. 

Recall that there are various senses in which a full subcategory $G \subseteq C$ may "generate" a category $C$. For example, in order of increasing strength (under reasonable conditions): 

Here's how I look at this. Let $(\mathcal C,\otimes,I, \sigma)$ be a symmetric monoidal category. Recall that the dimension of a dualizable object $C \in \mathcal C$ is the trace of the identity map on $C$; it lives in $End_{\mathcal C}(I)$. EDIT: This is what Charles referred to as the Euler characteristic. Observations: 

So far the only counterexamples I have to dropping the pointwise hypothesis in these statements are in the cases (1) and (2), which I've detailed in CW responses. 

(With apologies for reviving an old question which already has many answers) here are two perspectives: 

Question B. Do these statements have analogs when $R$ is nonconnective? If so, are they straightforward extensions of these statements from the connective case? For Question B, feel free to substitute a better example of a statement if you like. 

So this was really a question about clopen idempotents. Also, everything seems to continue to work in the braided case. Two other interesting facts proved in the Boyarchencko-Drinfeld preprint: 

The claim is that if $D$ admits strict reindexing, then so does $C$, and $p$ preserves the strict reindexing. 

I think there is something intriguing and slightly mysterious going on here. First, my proposed definition would be slightly different from Dimitri Chikladze's. I agree that the natural generalization of the slice categories $\mathcal V /C$ for $C \in \mathcal V$ should probably be the comodule categories $\mathbf{Comod}(C)$ for $C$ a commutative comonoid in $\mathcal V$. But to me, the fundamental way to characerize local cartesian closedness of $\mathcal V$ is that for $f: C \to D$ in $\mathcal V$, the reindexing functor $f_! : \mathcal V/C \to \mathcal V/D$ (defined by postcomposition) not only has a right adjoint $f^\ast$ (defined by pullback), but $f^\ast$ itself has a right adjoint $f_\ast$ (the local hom functor). So I would say: 

and if so, is it true that in in a stable $\infty$-category, finite limits and finite colimits coincide whenever this makes sense? I would regard this as investigating a different sort of exactness to the exactness properties enjoyed by ($\infty$)-toposes. In the topos case, I think there are some good answers. For one, in a topos $C$, the functor $C^\mathrm{op} \to \mathsf{Cat}$, $X \mapsto C/X$ preserves limits. Foir another, a Grothendieck topos $C$ is what Street calls "lex total": there is a left exact left adjoint to the Yoneda embedding. It would be nice to have similar statements here which in some sense formulate a "maximal" list of exactness properties enjoyed by (presentable, perhaps) stable $\infty$-categories, rather than the "minimal" lists found in (1,2) and (1',2') above. 

This is different from $C$ being dualizable ($[C,D] = C^\vee \otimes D$). (EDIT: It turns out to be the same -- see Mike Shulman's answer!) But for example, if $C$ is a locally free sheaf of finite rank on a scheme/locally ringed space $X$, then $C$ has this property in the category of quasicoherent sheaves, or in the category of $\mathcal O_X$-modules -- just check locally. Here I'm working in a symmetric monoidal closed category $\mathcal C$ with monoidal product $\otimes$, unit $I$, internal hom $[-,-]$, and $E^\vee$ denotes the dual $E^\vee = [E,I]$. I'm really tempted to call such an object $C$ "locally free (of finite rank)", because the condition says that you can understand maps $D \to C$ as long as you internally (i.e. locally) understand maps $D \to I$, i.e. maps into the canonical "free" object. Perhaps I should say "locally Cauchy-free" instead of "locally free (of finite rank)", since presumably the significance of "locally being able to take finite sums of $I$" is that finite sums of $I$ are $\mathcal C$-enriched absolute colimits (a.k.a. $\mathcal C$-enriched Cauchy colimits) in the additive context. But I don't understand what's going on well enough to firmly draw this connection.
