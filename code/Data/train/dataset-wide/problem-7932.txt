In general, the answer to this question is no. Counterexamples can be found by using Day's notion of a promonoidal category, see $URL$ To give a promonoidal structure on a small (additive) category is equivalent to giving biclosed monoidal structure on the category of (additive) presheaves. The compact projective objects in the latter are well understood, they are precisely the retracts of finite direct sums of representables. For an explicit example, take your domain category to consist of two objects and no non-trivial morphisms. Its presheaf category is simply the category $\mathrm{Ab} \times \mathrm{Ab}$ of pairs of abelian groups $(A,B)$. The representables are $(\mathbb{Z},0)$ and $(0,\mathbb{Z})$, so the compact projective objects in this category are precisely the pairs $(P,Q)$ where both $P$ and $Q$ are projective. For any fixed abelian group $M$ there is a promonoidal structure whose resulting tensor product is given by $(A,B) \otimes (A^{\prime},B^{\prime})=(A\otimes A^{\prime},A\otimes B^{\prime} + B \otimes A^{\prime} + B \otimes B^{\prime} \otimes M)$. This has unit $(\mathbb{Z},0)$ and the associativity isomorphism is built from associator and symmetry of the standard symmetric monoidal structure on $\mathrm{Ab}$ (you can even get it to be strictly associative if you take a skeleton of $\mathrm{Ab}$). Now if you take $M$ to be any abelian group that is not finitely generated projective, then $(0,\mathbb{Z}) \otimes (0,\mathbb{Z}) \cong (0,M)$ is not compact projective. 

The category of topological spaces is not locally $\lambda$-presentable for any $\lambda$. The reason for this is the existence of spaces which aren't $\lambda$-presentable (a.k.a. $\lambda$-small) for any $\lambda$ (in a locally presentable category every object is $\lambda$-presentable for some $\lambda$). An example of such a space is the Sierpinski space; a proof of this can be found in Mark Hovey's book on model categories, on page 49. There is a convenient category of topological spaces which is locally presentable, the category of $\Delta$-generated spaces. This category contains most of the spaces usually studied by algebraic topologists (for example, the geometric realization of any simplicial set is a $\Delta$-generated space). Daniel Dugger has some expository notes on this here. A proof that the category of $\Delta$-generated spaces is locally presentable can be found this paper of L. Fajstrup and J. Rosický. The second question was already answered in the comments: if $G\colon \mathbf{Top}^{\mathrm{op}} \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$ is continuous, then it has a left adjoint $F$ by the special adjoint functor theorem. Therefore we have natural isomorphisms $G(X) \cong \mathbf{Set}(\ast,GX) \cong \mathbf{Top}^{\mathrm{op}}(F(\ast),X)=\mathbf{Top}(X,F(\ast))$, which shows that $G$ is represented by $F(\ast)$. Edit: added the missing op's mentioned in the comment. 

This is indeed not true. Peter Freyd and Ross Street proved in the paper on the size of categories that both $\mathcal{D}$ and $\mathbf{Set}^{\mathcal{D}}$ have small hom-sets if and only if the category $\mathcal{D}$ is essentially small, so any category which has a large set of objects will give a counterexample. 

As a prototype example of ergodic diffusion, consider a real valued Ornstein Uhlenbeck process of the form $$ d X_t = -\alpha X_t d t + \sigma d W_t, \quad X_0 = x $$ where $\alpha, \sigma > 0$ are constant and $W$ is a real valued Wiener process. I am trying to get some help to clarify the connection between the relaxation time $\tau$ related to the convergence to the invariant probability measure and the first eigenvalue of the generator $$ - A = \frac{\sigma^2}{2} \partial_{xx} - \alpha x \partial_x $$ We consider the minus sign to have a positive spectrum. I have not been able identify a proper reference but this connection is known for a class of ergodic processes. Let me do some calculations to see what's going on. First, on one hand, a quick check tells us that $X_t$ has a gaussian density that is : $$ p_{t,x}(y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi} \Sigma_t} \exp \left ( - \frac{1}{2} \left (\frac{y-m_t(x)}{\Sigma_t} \right )^2 \right ) $$ where $$ m_t(x) = \exp(-\alpha t) x \quad \mbox{and} \quad \Sigma_t^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{2\alpha} (1-\exp(-2 \alpha t )) $$ and therefore $$ \lim_{t \to \infty} p_{t,x}(y) = \frac{1}{\sigma} \sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\pi}} \exp \left ( - \alpha \left (\frac{y}{\sigma} \right )^2 \right ). $$ Next using the function $$ \sqrt{2 \pi} F(\xi,\eta) \triangleq \frac{1}{\xi} \exp \left ( -\frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{\eta}{\xi} \right )^2 \right ) $$ and when $t$ is large we have $$ p_{t,x}(y) - p(y) \approx F_\xi \left ( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2 \alpha}}, y \right ) \left ( \Sigma_t - \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2\alpha}} \right ) + F_\eta \left ( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2 \alpha}}, y \right ) m_t(x) $$ which yields $$ \lim_{t \to \infty} - \frac{1}{t} \log( |p_{t,x}(y) - p(y)| ) = \frac{1}{\alpha}. $$ Comment : I am somehow surprised that $\sigma$ does not affect this relaxation time. As explained in $URL$ the simplest theoretical description of relaxation as function of time t is an exponential law $\exp \left (-\frac{t}{\tau} \right )$. On the other hand, taking $w(x) = x$, we clearly see that $$ A w = \alpha w, $$ in other words, $\alpha$ is an eigenvalue (the first one, we call it $\lambda_1$) for $A$ and it is related to the eigenvector $w$. We finally observe that the first eigenvalue of $A$ is the inverse of the time of relaxation for $p_{x,t}$, concisely $$ \fbox{$\lambda_1 \tau = 1$}. $$ question : What is the deep reason for such a connection between $\tau$ and $\lambda_1$? 

Let $\{ X_t, t \geq 0 \}$ be a $\mathbb{R}^d$-valued stochastic process on a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$. Assumption 

Question How to get rid of the expectation? In the sense, $$ \lim_{t \to\infty} \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f(X_s) \mbox{d} s = \nu(f), \: \mbox{a.s.} $$ I would like to avoid the renewal reward theorem. 

Bertrand Toën is using a different definition of localization than what you describe in your question. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a category and let $\Sigma$ be a class of morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. A category $\mathcal{D}$ with a functor $L\colon \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ is called a localization of $\mathcal{C}$ at $\Sigma$ if $L(f)$ is an isomorphism for every $f \in \Sigma$, and $L$ is universal with this property, that is, whenever $F \colon \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ is a functor such that $F(f)$ is an isomorphism for all $f\in \Sigma$, then there exists a unique functor $G \colon \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{E}$ with $F=G \circ L$. If a localization of $\mathcal{C}$ at $\Sigma$ exists, then it is unique up to isomorphism and ususally denoted by $\Sigma^{-1}\mathcal{C}$ or $\mathcal{C}[\Sigma^{-1}]$. Note that we do not make any assumptions about the class $\Sigma$. As with all universal properties, such an object need not exist in the most general case: usually the resulting category might be "too big", that is, there would be a proper class of morphisms between certain objects in the localization. If the class $\Sigma$ admits a right calculus of fractions in the sense of (e.g.) Borceux, Handbook of Categorical Algebra, Volume I, Chapter 5, then the localization of $\mathcal{C}$ at $\Sigma$ does exist. However, there are lots of examples of categories with classes $\Sigma$ which do have a localization but don't admit a right calculus of fractions. In many of these cases, the functor $L \colon \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathcal{D}$ will then not have a right adjoint. One of the main sources of such categories are Quillen model categories $\mathcal{M}$, with $\Sigma$ the class of weak equivalences. The localization at $\Sigma$ is then called the homotopy category of $\mathcal{M}$. In fact, the notion of Quillen categories was invented mainly to deal with the difficulties of formally inverting a class of arrows in a category. There is a model structure on the category of small categories (sometimes called the folk model structure) whose weak equivalences are the equivalences of categories, so the desired localization does exist. Moreover, there is a notion of left and right homotopy in a model category. For nice objects (objects which are both fibrant and cofibrant), these notions agree and define an equivalence relation on maps. In the model category of categories, all objects are fibrant and cofibrant. Two functors are homotopic if and only if they are naturally isomorphic. The usual construction of the homotopy category of a model category (see e.g. Mark Hovey's book "Model Categories") shows that the localization of $\mathbf{Cat}$ at the equivalences is given by the category whose objects are again categories and whose morphisms are homotopy classes of morphisms. Thus we do indeed find that the localization of $\mathbf{Cat}$ at the class of equivalences is the category $\vert \mathbf{Cat} \vert$ of categories and isomorphism classes of functors, as Toën claimed. Charles Rezk has a nice writeup of the folk model structure here. 

Dear all, Consider the $(n+1)\times (n+1)$ matrix $A$ with indeterminates $X_i, Y_i$, $0\leq i\leq n$ such that the $(i,j)$-th entry is given by $X_i^jY_i^{n-j}$. The $i$-th row is $(X_i^n,X_i^{n-1}Y_i,\dots,Y_i^n)$ that can be thought as given by the Veronese embedding $\mathbb{P}^1\to\mathbb{P}^n$. The determinant of $A$ is multi-homogeneous and hence defines a variety in $\prod_{i=0}^n\mathbb{P}^1$. It can be checked that $\det(A)$ has the following nice factorization $$ \det(A)=\prod_{0\leq i<j\leq n}\det\left(\begin{smallmatrix}X_j & Y_j\\X_i & Y_i\end{smallmatrix}\right) $$ which gives the decomposition of the corresponding variety. Actually, setting $Y_i=1$, $0\leq i\leq n$, the matrix $A$ simply becomes the Vandermonde matrix and the above factorization becomes $\det(A)=\prod_{0\leq i<j\leq n}(X_j-X_i)$, as is well known. We may also consider its higher dimensional generalization: for $n,d\geq 1$, let $N={n+d\choose d}$. Consider the $N\times N$ matrix $A$ whose $i$-th row is given by the $n$-uple Veronese embedding $\mathbb{P}^d\to\mathbb{P}^N$ that sents $(X_{i,0},\dots,X_{i,d})$ to the $N$-tuple consisting of all monomials in $X_{i,0},\dots,X_{i,d}$ with total degree $n$. Question: for $d>1$, does $\det(A)$ admit similar factorization? Or is it simply irreducible? Setting $X_{i,0}=1$ for all $i$ gives the higher dimensional analogue of the Vandermonde matrix which arises naturally in, for example, the problem of multivariate interpolation. For the multivariate case, I have never seen a simple explicit form of $\det(A)$ as the univariate one, though. So I guess it must be complicated. And my understanding in this case is very limited. I tried to calculate the determinant in a naive way (by mimicing the calculation in the 1-dimension case) but the amount of calculation blows up quickly. But maybe there are structures that I didn't recognize which help simplifying the calculation. So I am also looking for any suggestion for better calculation methods (grobner basis, tools from algebraic combinatorics, representation theory, etc). Thanks a lot! 

Transitive groups e.g. $G=\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ certainly have this property but I wonder if there exist infinitely many intransitive examples. I think one can easily reduce to the case that $G$ is a primitive linear group but then I don't know how to proceed. 

I am interested in intransitive irreducible linear subgroups $G\subseteq\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_p)$ acting on $V-\{0\}=\mathbb{F}_p^n-\{0\}$ in the natural way, such that all of the orbits are very large, with constant density in $V$. Actually I am wondering if there exists an infinite family of groups satisfying this property. Here $p$ is supposed to be a fixed prime. The question can be formalized as follows:

Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ (the most interesting case to me is $q=O(1)$). Let $A$ be an arbitrary subset of $V$ that spans $V$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$. Let $\mu=|A|/|V|$ be the density of $A$. What can we say about the smallest $k$ such that every $v\in V$ can be written as a linear combination of $t\leq k$ elements $a_1,\dots, a_t\in A$ $$ v=\sum_{i=1}^t c_i a_i $$ with coefficients $c_i\in\mathbb{F}_q$? I can prove $k\leq (1/\mu)^c$ for some constant $c>0$, basically by repeating applying the fact that $|A-A|\geq (3/2)|A|$ if $A$ is not a subgroup of $V$. This fact follows from an argument of Laba, and is stated as Lemma 2.5 in the following survey by Lovett: $URL$ Is there a better upper bound? And any lower bounds known?
