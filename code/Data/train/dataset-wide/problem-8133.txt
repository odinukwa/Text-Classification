No. Take $f(x) = 1 + y^2 + (xy-1)^2$. Let $$D = \{ (x,y) : 0 \leq x,\ 0 \leq y \leq 2,\ xy \leq 2 \}.$$ Then $f(x,y) \leq 3$ on $D$, so the integral of $1/f$ is bounded below by $(1/3) \mathrm{Area}(D)$. But the area of $D$ is infinite. 

Here are some basic thoughts. Let $G$ be a vector field which is of the form $\nabla \times F$, and also obeys $\nabla \times G = 0$. Since $\nabla \times G = 0$, the vector field $G$ is locally of the form $\nabla h$ for some scalar valued function $h$. The condition that $G = \nabla \times F$ imples that $\nabla \cdot G=0$ or, in other words, $\nabla^2(h)=0$. This says that $h$ is harmonic. So, locally, the condition is equivalent to $G$ being the gradient of a harmonic function. Globally, if $\Omega$ is not simply connected, then traveling around a loop in $\Omega$ may change $h$ by a constant. From this, we can see that, if $G$ is compactly supported, it is zero: If $G$ is $0$ outside a ball of radius $R$, then $h$ is constant outside that ball, and thus $h$ is constant everywhere. We can also trot out our favorite conditions to ensure that a harmonic function is constant. For example, if $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^3$, and $G(x) \to 0$ as $|x| \to \infty$, then $|h(x)| = o(x)$ and a variant of Liouville's theorem tells us that $h$ is constant and $G=0$. The OP seems to be interested in conditions on the flux of $G$ across $\partial \Omega$. In order to make this make sense, I am going to assume that the set up is that $\overline{\Omega}$ is a compact manifold with boundary. Let $R$ be the flux of $G$ across $\partial \Omega$. As the OP already knows, if $R=0$ then $G=0$. And the assignment of $G \mapsto R$ is linear, so this shows that $R$ determines $G$. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be the vector space of functions on $\partial \Omega$ which can occur as such an $R$. The OP asks for conditions which force $G$ to be zero. In other words, he wants a vector space $\mathcal{W}$ of functions on $\partial \Omega$ which is transverse to $\mathcal{V}$. I find that an odd way to think about the question -- better to just characterize $\mathcal{V}$! Now, the obvious observation is that $\int_{\partial \Omega} R=0$ for any $R$ in $\mathcal{V}$, since $\nabla \cdot G=0$. It would be really cool if that were a precise characterization of $\mathcal{V}$. But I don't think it is. Let $\Omega$ be a solid cylinder, and let $R$ be zero on the sides of $\Omega$ and a hat function on top and bottom, dying out smoothly as it approaches the sides. Is $R$ the flux of some $G$? I couldn't figure out how to make it be. 

This is an elaboration on Tyler Lawson's comment: For $A \in \mathrm{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{Q})$, the following are equivalent: (0) There is a nonzero integer $M$ so that $M \cdot A^r$ has integer entries for all $r \geq 0$. (1) $A = g B g^{-1}$ for some $B \in \mathrm{Mat}_{n \times n}(\mathbb{Z})$ and $g \in GL_n(\mathbb{Q})$ (2) All the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial $\det(t \mathrm{Id} - A)$ are integers. Proofs: $(0) \implies (1)$. Let $\Lambda$ be the subgroup of $\mathbb{Q}^n$ generated by $A^r \mathbb{Z}^n$ for all $r \geq 0$. Then $\frac{1}{M} \mathbb{Z}^n \subseteq \Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^n$ so $\Lambda$ is a free abelian group of rank $n$. Choosing a basis for $\Lambda$ places $A$ in the required form. $(1) \implies (2)$ Obvious. $(2) \implies (0)$ Let the characteristic polynomial be $t^n + b_{n-1} t^{n-1} + \cdots b_1 t + b_0$. Then, by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, $$A^{r+n} = - \left( b_{n-1} A^{r+n-1} + \cdots + b_1 A^{r+1} + b_0 A^r \right).$$ So, for $s \geq n$, the matrix $A^s$ is in the integer span of $A^0$, $A^1$, ..., $A^{n-1}$. Choosing $M$ large enough to clear the denominators of these finitely many matrices proves the result. Note that description (1) makes it easy to find many examples. 

Here $S = \mathrm{Spec}\ A$ where $A$ is a complete integrally closed noetherian local ring, $K = \mathrm{Frac}\ A$, and $k$ is the residue field of $A$. Saying a stable curve $X$ over $k$ is $k$-split degenerate means (see shortly after Defn 3.2) 

As has been explained above, the zeta function has a factor for each completion of $\mathbb{Q}$. The factor at $\mathbb{R}$ has to do with integrating $e^{- \pi x^2}$ and the factor at $\mathbb{Q}_p$ has to do with integrating the characteristic function of $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Some people might wonder why these two functions were chosen. The answer is simple: they are both their own Fourier transforms. Also, I don't think anyone has recommended Terry Tao's expository post on this material yet. It is quite good. 

Victor Protsak suggests this, and I'll endorse it: the careful construction of the Grassmannian. This is a good example for 3 reasons. (1) It is extremely important. (2) It is a situation where it is both natural to work in local coordinates and with a global projective embedding, so students can practice transforming between the two perspectives. (3) It is small enough to do in full detail, but it usually isn't. Ideally, this would include proving that the Grassmannian represents the functor of flat families of subspaces of a vector space. (Or quotient spaces, whichever you prefer.) 

This is a comment on Pietro Majer's answer, with graphics. The first figure shows $x^2$ (red) and the first five functions of Pietro's method approaching it (blue). The second figure shows the double derivatives thereof. As you can see, the functions are converging but their second derivatives are not. 

Didn't Euler prove that $\sum 1/p$ diverges? This proves that $\pi(N)$ is infinitely often larger than $N^{1-\epsilon}$: If there were only $N^{1-\epsilon}$ primes less than $N$, then there are at most $2^{k (1-\epsilon)}$ primes between $2^{k-1}$ and $2^k$. So we can bound $\sum 1/p$ above by $\sum 2^{k(1-\epsilon)}/2^{k-1} = 2 \sum 2^{-k \epsilon}$, which converges. UPDATE: I should clarify that I see no way to get from here to the stronger statement that $\pi(N)$ is greater than $N^{1 - \epsilon}$ for all sufficiently large $N$. 

In theory, Groebner basis software can do this. I don't know whether there is a standard package for this purpose, or what practical issues may arise. Here is the theory: Your goal is the following. You are given rational functions $r_1$, $r_2$, ..., $r_n$ in $x$ and $y$. You would like know whether there are polynomials $f(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$ and $g(t_1,\ldots, t_n)$ such that $f(r_1, \ldots, r_n) - g(r_1, \ldots, r_n) x =0$, and similarly for $y$ in place of $x$. Our strategy will be the following: Map $k[t_1, \ldots, t_n, u] \to k(x,y)$ by $t_i \mapsto r_i$, $u \mapsto x$. Let $I$ be the kernel of this map. We will test whether $I$ contains an element whose degree in $u$ is $1$. Actually we need to do slightly more than that: we need to find an element $f u - g$ where $f$ and $g$ are not in $I$, but the Grobner technology will do that for us. The problem breaks into two parts Getting the ideal $I$ If the $r_i$ are themselves polynomials in $x$ and $y$, you can see a worked example of doing this with Grobner bases in the Macualay documentation here. Macaulay also provides a function kernel which does this; I don't know what the advantages are of using kernel or doing it by hand. If $r_i=p_i/q_i$, my first idea is to define the ring $S = k[x,y,s_1, \ldots, s_n]/(q_i(x,y) s_i -1)$, and map $k[t_1, \ldots, t_n]$ to $S$ by $t_i \mapsto p_i(x,y) s_i$, and adapt the Grobner basis methods to this case. If you are working in Macaulay specifically, then Macaualy has a class FractionField, with Ring as an ancestor class, meaning you should be able to directly talk about maps $k[t_1, \ldots, t_n,u] \to k(x,y)$, and not just about maps to quotients of polynomial rings. However, the documentation of FractionField warns that using it is a performance hit; so you might still be better off only inverting the elements you need to invert. Testing whether $I$ contains an element of degree $1$ in $u$ The way to do this in theory is to compute a Grobner basis of $I$ in lex order, putting the variable $u$ first. If the answer contains an element $fu-g$ of degree $1$, then this is your answer; if not, then $x$ cannot be written as a rational expression in the $r_i$. Note that $f$ and $g$ will not be in $I$ as, if they were, $fu-g$ would be eliminated from the Grobner basis as redundant. But lex term orders are notoriously slow, so there might be a better way to do this in practice. Hopefully, someone will show up soon who understands these issues. 

My preferred proof is to consider $Z(s) := \prod_{\chi} L(\chi, s)$, where the product is over all characters of $\mathbb{Z}/n$, including the trivial character. It is easy to see that $L(s, \chi)$ is meromorphic near $s=1$, and analytic for $\chi$ nontrivial. So, if any of the $L(1,\chi)$'s were zero, then $Z(s)$ would be analytic near $1$. But $Z(s)$ is the $\zeta$-function of $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$. If you know the class number formula for $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n]$, then you immediately know that $Z(s)$ has a pole at $s=1$. I think the best approach is to prove this class number formula. If you want, you can also use the idea of the class number proof but cut some corners. Namely:
