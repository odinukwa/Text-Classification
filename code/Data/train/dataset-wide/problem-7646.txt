Seeing that algori is asking for a reference, I'd like to offer Liviu Nicolaescu's "Invitation to Morse Theory" as a superb modern treatment of the subject. I am fairly certain the result you are looking for is in there. 

I am wondering if it is true that every compact, connected, oriented manifold is cobordant to a simply connected manifold. I believe that some sort of surgery will do the trick. Roughly speaking, I want to add handles so that I can kill representative loops. However, I don't know if my surgery process builds a cobordism and it is hard to for me to see what the new boundary is. Another possibility is to build a Morse function that constructs the cobordism for free. It is hard for me to get an intuition for what is going on, because all the compact, oriented 2-manifolds are boundaries and consequently cobordant to the empty set. CP^2 seems like the "easiest" test case, but it is already simply-connected for cellular reasons. Lens Spaces might be a nice candidate, but the 3 dimensional ones can be realized as boundaries of some disc bundle on S^2. If possible, I'd prefer a constructive procedure, but any answer that helps elucidate the material is welcome. 

I sympathize with your case. A 2.1 is really not bad. You shouldn't denigrate yourself and view your peripatetic interests as requiring redemption. Taking on a big unsolved problem without guidance or the background of a PhD student seems doomed to fail. Locking yourself in a library with all the world's books is unlikely to produce anything of merit. I have never heard of a case of a student producing something of "intriguing/charming/advanced" and using that to gain graduate admission. The romantic, amateur heroic view of math is largely bunk as pointed out by Terry Tao. There is still hope. I know that undergraduate research is less common in the UK, but I would expect that if you email lots of professors in areas of interest to you and basically offer yourself as cheap or free labor (undergrad student level), there is a good chance that you'll be taken on as an unofficial research student by someone. I know many cases of people in math and science using this sort of informal contact to start research projects that eventually develop into PhD positions. Making yourself known to a tenured professor who can write you a strong recommendation is probably enough to get you a PhD position somewhere (in the US, UK or Europe). It is unlikely that claiming to solve a big problem or do research on your own is going to be trusted by graduate committees. You need recommendations from people trusted in the academic community. There are MO users who have taken a decade or more off from education and successfully started PhD positions at Princeton and other top research institues. Good luck. 

Obviously, an answer to b) implies an answer for a). I'm not sure how much of my thinking I should put here. But I do know that if char K = p, then we get a homeomorphism of $V$ onto itself by translation for each $v \in V$, which each have finite order p. These are mapped to self-homeomorphisms of $W$ which also have order p, but a priori, they don't "see" any of the algebraic structure of $W$, so I'm not sure this is actually an obstruction. Any thoughts (or references) to proofs or counterexamples would be greatly appreciated. 

Let $\Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0}$ be the set of non-negative real numbers and $\Bbb{R}^{+}$be the set of positive reals. Let us say that a function $f \colon \Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0} \to \Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0}$ is eventually sublinear if $\ \forall r \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \ \exists x_0 \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \colon \forall x \geq x_0, f(x) < rx$. Let $S$ be the set of non-decreasing, eventually sublinear functions (we require no continuity). We define an equivalence relation on $S$: $f \sim g$ if and only if $f$ and $g$ are eventually boundedly close, i.e., $\exists K>0\ \exists x_0 \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \colon \forall x \geq x_0, |f(x)-g(x)| < K$. Denote the set of equivalence classes of $S$ under $\sim$ by $\ T$. Question 1: What is the cardinality of $\ T$? Question 2: Does this cardinality change if we drop the requirement that the functions are non-decreasing? What if the co-domain becomes $\Bbb{R}$? Looking at the set of pairwise non-equivalent sublinear functions $\{f(x) = r*ln(x) \mid r \in \Bbb{R}\}$ shows that $|T|$ must be at least as big as the cardinality of the reals, $\beth_1$. Also, $|T|$ can be no bigger than the cardinality of all functions from $\Bbb{R}$ to $\Bbb{R}$, which is $\beth_2$, the cardinality of the power set of the reals. So there seem to be three options: Option 1: ZFC proves $|T| = \beth_1$. Option 2: ZFC proves $|T| = \beth_2$. Option 3: This question is independent from ZFC (but perhaps not independent from ZFC + Generalized CH?). Different proof ideas involving explicit bounds or forcing are failing me. So does anyone know of an answer and a proof? Thanks. 

Motivation A topological vector space is a vector space over a (topological) field, K, that carries a topology such that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous maps, e.g., all normed vector spaces. Since $\mathbb{C} \approx \mathbb{R}^2$ as topological spaces (with their standard topologies), it's clear that the actual field cannot be detected by the topology alone. Also, cardinality considerations show that any topology on a finite field cannot be homeomorphic to a vector space over a field of characteristic $0$. But that still says nothing about whether there are some topologies, such that, for instance $\mathbb{Z}_p(t) \approx \mathbb{Q}$. I can't find any topological invariants that will distinguish just the fields (as vectors spaces of dimension 1). I suspect that if this problem is solvable, it will be just be topological group considerations, but I can't figure out how to do it. 

In Rezk's paper "A model for the homotopy theory of homotopy theory" numerous references to simplicial covering maps are made. It's first appearance being at the bottom of page 8. Unfortunately no definition is provided in the paper and I was wondering if there is a purely combinatorial definition for this concept or whether we have to pass to the geometric realization. Maps of simplicial sets already match cells of the same dimension (roughly speaking), but it is the evenly covered concept that requires some work (I imagine). Any help would be appreciated. 

I agree with Scott firmly here. The Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics is a beautiful subject with immediate doorways to symplectic geometry, but unnecessary for the appreciation of the basic postulates of QM ("The Universe is a vector space..."). Honestly, if Qiaochu wants to appreciate this clean formulation and not worry about "perturbative expansions of blah blah blah," this is sufficient. I am also a huge fan of Griffith's "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics" as a first book. It can be read without serious knowledge of electromagnetism and classical mechanics. I know that the MIT physics undergraduate curriculum does not require Lagrangian/Hamiltonian Classical Mechanics before their 3 term QM sequence. This means for Qiaochu that 8.01 and 8.02 is sufficient, 18.03 is more important, and I have heard of many a MIT student taking 8.05 without 8.04, but don't expect a physics professor to say that to you. (My apologies for the MIT-speak) The problem with learning "grown-up" mechanics (at MIT 8.07 or Sussman's 6.946J, which I recommend highly) before QM is that this path leads more naturally to understanding more differential-geometric concepts and consequently takes serious time. This is fine for a physicist and is probably a wise move before taking GR, but for a growing mathematician, I would advise understanding smooth manifold theory before trying to learn the more sophisticated and elegant approach to mechanics. This inevitably entails a much more firm grounding in ODE theory and I recommend V.I. Arnold's ODEs book for that. Once you have these two perspectives in hand you can then sit back and wonder how the QM Universe-as-a-Hilbert-space viewpoint and the GR Universe-as-a-C^2-manifold description can ever be reconciled. 

I learned Quantum Mechanics and Linear Algebra in tandem, so Schrodinger's linear time-independent equation has always had a special place in my heart. It shows that eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental to our description of atomic physics. Also treating observables as operators was a great conceptual revolution. 

Yes. I claim that, for any $K'$ point of $X$, if this point extends both to an $R'$ point and an $K$ point, then it extends to a $R$ point. This obviously proves the result. Let $x'$ be the closed point of $\mathrm{Spec}(R')$. Let $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ be an affine neighborhood of the image of $x'$. Then the $R'$ point must factor through $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$. The $K$ point also factors through $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$, as it has the same image as the $K'$ point. We can now transform the question into algebra. The algebraic statement is that we have a map $A \to K'$ which factors through both $K$ and $R'$. But then the image of this map must lie in $K \cap R' = R$. So the map factors through $\mathrm{Spec}(R)$, and our $K$ point extends to an $R$ point. 

I assume the points are meant to take integer values between $0$ and $N$. The second question is easier. The probability that the median is $j$ is $$\binom{j}{k} \binom{N-j}{k} / \binom{N+1}{2k+1}.$$ (I hope I'm not answering homework here. If I am, remember that you need to justify this statement to get full marks.) The probability that $j/N$ is between $x$ and $x+dx$ is roughly $$\frac{(2k+1)!}{(k!)^2} x^k (1-x)^k dx ,$$ as $N$ goes to infinity with $k$ fixed. When you allow repetition, you should have the same asymptopics, but the problem is just messy enough that I can't get a simple answer. My best formula is $$\frac{(2k+1)!}{(k!)^2} \frac{1}{(N+1)^{2k+1}} \int_{x=0}^1 (x+j)^k (N-j+x)^k dx.$$ Bounding the integral by the minimum and maximum values of the integrand gives reasonable bounds. I'll provide a proof if needed. 

An even more basic example: take $X$ to be any singular affine variety, and $f$ to be the inclusion of $X$ into the affine space $\mathbb{A}^N$. 

The Bernoulli numbers are closely related to alternating permutations. That is to say, permutations like $1524376$ where the numbers alternately go up and down. Specifically, if $A_n$ is the number of such permutations of an $n$ element set, then $$B_{2n} = (-1)^{n-1} \frac{2n}{4^{2n}-2^{2n}} A_{2n-1}.$$ It's possible you could somehow relate your sums over diagrams to alternating permutations. 

Ax and Kochen proved decidability for the ring of $p$-adic numbers, and many rings like it. That certainly doesn't follow from Tarski, and I would say it is more difficult. 

Let's see why. $Y' \setminus (D_1 \cup D_2 \cup E) \cong Y \setminus (D_1 \cup D_2) \cong \{ (z_1, z_2) \in (\mathbb{C}^*)^2 : |z_1|^2+|z_2|^2<1 \}$. This last space clearly retracts onto $(S^1)^2$, with fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Explicitly, a small loop around $D_1$ is given by $(r e^{i \theta}, s)$, for some small $r$ and $s$, and hence has class $(1,0)$. Similarly, a small loop around $D_2$ has class $(0,1)$. A small loop around $E$ (this is the one you might have to think about) is given by $(r e^{i \theta}, s e^{i \theta})$ for $r$ and $s$ small, and hence has class $(1,1)$. As desired, $(1,1)=(1,0)+(0,1)$.
