Let $A$ be a $ \mathbb{C}$-algebra. Then we have the following increasing union: $$ {\rm GL}_1(A) \subseteq {\rm GL}_2(A) \subseteq {\rm GL}_3(A) \subseteq \dots \subset {\rm GL}(A) $$ We call $ {\rm GL}(A)$ the stable general linear group over $A$. The stable general linear groups together form a functor $$ {\rm GL} : \text{\( \mathbb{C} \)-algebras} \to \text{Groups} $$ What if anything can be said about $ {\rm GL}$? I am pretty sure it is not representable. Is it even a sheaf for any reasonable topology? 

I can fill in the details but they are messy and I have very little idea what the details actually mean. Thinking about $ \mathbb{P}^n $ as a variety, I understand why $D_+(X_0)$ should be $ {\rm spec} \mathbb{C} [X_1/X_0,X_2/X_0, \dots, X_n / X_0] $ but I don't really understand how this intuition translates into the commutative algebra which is boxed above. Also, for homogeneous elements of degree higher than $1$ I have no idea what is going on. I understand that geometrically the veronese map should be involved but I don't understand how that intuition translates into the messy proof which I am able to write down. 

Let $F$ be a combinatorial species. The exponential generating series of $F$ is defined to be $$ \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{ \lvert F_n \lvert x^n}{n!} $$ It was observed by Baez and Dolan in their paper "From finite sets to Feymann diagrams" that the exponential generating series can be categorified to a 1-groupoid $$ \sum_{n \geq 0} F_n \times X^n // S_n $$ You recover the exponential generating series by taking groupoid cardinality and setting $ x = \lvert X \lvert $. The cycle index series is another important series attached to a combinatorial species. It is defined by $$ Z_F(x_1,x_2,\dots) = \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{1}{n!} \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \lvert {\rm Fix}(F[\sigma])\lvert x_1^{\sigma_1} x_2^{\sigma_2} \dots $$ 

On nlab it says that a presheaf is locally isomorphic to a sheaf. What do they mean by locally isomorphic? Their definition of locally isomorphic is given in terms of Grothendieck topologies which i think is overkill. When I first read the nlab page, I thought that it might mean that every presheaf, when restricted to a small enough open set is a sheaf, but I have doubts now because I can't find a proof in the literature and I can't prove it myself. 

I have always thought that pointwise Kan extensions are better than normal Kan extensions because you can actually compute them using a (co)end 

The first is an ${\rm End}(E)$-valued 2-form on $M$ and the second is a $\mathfrak{gl}_n$-valued 2-form on ${\rm Fr} \, E$ 

In all that follows, we are working over $\mathbb{C}$. Let $B \subseteq P \subseteq {\rm GL}(n)$ be a parabolic subgroup. Can you say anything in general about the representations of $P$? I suspect the answer is no because I couldn't find anything about this in the standard books or using google. If $P = B$ then everything is easy: any rep breaks up as a sum of 1 dimensional subreps on which the torus acts by some character and the unipotent radical acts as the identity. 

Let $ \mathscr{T} $ be the category of [insert technical conditions here] topological spaces. Equip $ \mathscr{T}$ with the quillen model structure. The category of based spaces $ \mathscr{T}_*$ inherits a model structure. 

I think I understand what you are asking. When one first learns about schemes, it is often very hard to link the language of schemes and the geometry. Suppose you are sitting in a seminar, and the speaker comments: 

The symmetric group action you have described is exactly the action of the weyl group on the weight spaces. Let $v$ be a highest weight vector. Then $$ \sum_{\sigma \in S_n} \sigma v $$ is non zero and invariant under the symmetric group action. The reason it is non zero is because the component in the highest weight subspace is non zero. 

I have been learning about homotopy type theory this summer. I am not a homotopy theorist but I am more comfortable with homotopy theory than I am with type theory, so the way I rationalize many of the constructions used is by thinking in terms of homotopy theory. For example, when someone says type, i think homotopy type of a space. When someone says type family, I think of the family of fibers of some fibration. $ \Sigma $ types are total spaces and dependent function types are sections of a fibration. Things like path induction and function extensionality are easy to understand from this perspective. One thing that I have never really understood is how to think about the universe $ \mathcal{U} $. It is a type, so it should be the homotopy type of some space? Assuming this, the univalence axiom says that there is one path component for every homotopy type. Moreover, we have some sort of universal fibration $$ \Sigma_{A : \mathcal{U}} A \to \mathcal{U} $$ and the fiber over the path component corresponding to the homotopy type $A$ has homotopy type $A$. I have read things like "Morally, $\mathcal{U}$ is an object classifier" and "$\Sigma_{A : \mathcal{U}} A \to \mathcal{U} $ behaves like a universal fibration", but i dont really know how to make intuitive sense of these statements. 

Let $X$ be a scheme and $ \mathscr{L}$ be a line bundle on $X$. In a few proofs I have seen the scheme $$ L = \mathscr{S}{\rm pec} \oplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \mathscr{L}^{\otimes n} \to X$$ pop up. Does the scheme $ L $ have a name? How should I be thinking about $L$? 

Suppose that now we have produced a free resolution $ \oplus S \to \oplus S \to \dots \to \oplus S $ where the matrix entries are all homogeneous with positive degree. By modifying the gradings on all the copies of $S$, we do not destroy exactness, so we have an exact sequence of graded maps $$ \oplus S (-b^d_p) \to \dots \to \oplus S(-b^2_p) \to \oplus S(-b^1_p) $$ where $b_p^i > b_q^{i-1}$ for all $p,q$. Applying the graded $ \tilde{} $ functor gives us a free resolution of $ \mathscr{F}$. 

Maybe you are not so interested in this, but there is a nice physical interpretation of modules over a Frobenius algebra. (1+1)d TQFTs are used to describe topological phases of matter in 1d. Think of a sequence of spin 1/2 particles connected up in a line or a circle where the global state cannot be specified by local observables. Unfortunately, without more structure, topological phases of matter in 1d are trivial. This is a manifestation of the fact that any frobenius algebra is isomorphic to a product of matrix algebras. In this setting, bi-modules correspond to domain walls between different topological phases of matter. Since topological phases of matter are boring in 1d, this isn't really saying much. In 2d things are much more interesting. Topological phases of matter are now classified by (2+1)d TQFTs which can be specified by fusion categories and slight generalizations of them. There are a lot of interesting fusion categories and domain walls between the corresponding topological phases of matter are specified by bi-modules over fusion categories. 

The categories ${\rm Rep}(Q_8)$ and ${\rm Rep}(D_8)$ are not equivalent as tensor categories. They have the same Grothendieck ring, but they have non equivalent associators. As far as I am aware, it is an open problem to classify all tensor categories which have the same Grothendieck ring as ${\rm Rep}(Q_8)$ (there are at least two). 

All of this is probably easy if you know about stacks, so hopefully someone will share some of their stacky wisdom! 

Here is a trivial example: Assume that $X$ is a finite set, $\mathcal{A} = P(X)$ and $\mu$ is the counting measure. We can give $P(X)$ the structure of an undirected graph: Join $A$ and $B$ by an edge if they differ by a point. Then the metric induced on $\mathcal{A}$ by the measure is exactly the graph metric (i.e the distance between two points is the length of the shortest path). 

One of the main things I am worried about if forgetting the grading when we actually do the Grobner bases computation, but if we try and carry it along then things get really messy (at least for a human). OK, I guess that is it. Thanks for reading all that! 

I have been trying to learn some quantum field theory recently and I have a few questions which should be easy to answer for experts. I understand the basics of quantum mechanics / statistical mechanics, but I am having some trouble scaling this understanding up to qft. Before diving in, I want to emphasize that this is not a question about the foundations of qft. Right now, I am not so interested in thinking about how to define measures on spaces of fields or any of the more mathematically elaborate definitions of qft (although cobordisms do show up naturally). I just want to understand what is going on from the physics perspective. The Setup: Choose some space time manifold $M$ and a vector space $V$. The space of fields we are going to study is ${\rm maps}(M,V)$. Choose an action $S : {\rm maps}(M,V) \to \mathbb{R}$ which is presumably given by the integral of some Lagrangian. Then we associate the amplitude $$e^{ \frac{i S(\phi)}{\hbar}}$$ to the field $\phi \in {\rm maps}(M,V)$, where $\hbar$ is some value used to make the exponent unitless. Example 1: Consider the case $V = \mathbb{R}^3$ and $M = \mathbb{R}$. Then the fields $\gamma \in {\rm maps}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R}^3)$ are particle trajectories. If we choose the Lagrangian correctly, we can recover quantum mechanics. Indeed, we can recover the matrix entries of the unitary evolution operator from the following path integral: $$ \langle b,T | a,0 \rangle = \int_{\gamma(0)= a,\gamma(T)=b} e^{\frac{i S(\gamma)}{\hbar}} D\gamma$$ Question 1: How should I interpret the correlation function $$ C(t_1,t_2) = \int_{\gamma(0)= a,\gamma(T)=b} \gamma(t_1) \gamma(t_2) e^{\frac{i S(\gamma)}{\hbar}} D\gamma $$ Example 2: Now consider the case where $M = \mathbb{R}^4$ is Minkowski space and $V = \mathbb{C}$. I am not sure how to interpret the fields $\phi \in {\rm maps}(\mathbb{R}^4,\mathbb{C})$. It feels funny to call them wave functions in the quantum mechanics sense. Question 2: Choose a 4-dimensional tube $T \subseteq M$ and let ${\rm maps}_\partial(T,\mathbb{C})$ be the fields with some fixed boundary condition. How should I interpret the complex number $$ \int_{\phi \in {\rm maps}_\partial(T,\mathbb{C})} e^{\frac{i S(\phi)}{\hbar}} D\phi$$ Question 3: How should I interpret the correlation function $$ \int_{\phi \in {\rm maps}_\partial(T,\mathbb{C})} \phi(m_1) \phi(m_2) e^{\frac{i S(\phi)}{\hbar}} D\phi$$ I have read many times that this correlation function should be the amplitude of a particle propagating from $m_1$ to $m_2$ but I don't really understand this very well. Maybe it is supposed to be related to the fock space sitting inside ${\rm maps}({\rm maps}(M,V),\mathbb{C})$, but I am not sure. It is possible that I am completely on the wrong track. If this is the case, I would very much appreciate some pointers!
