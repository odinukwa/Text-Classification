The scale height of gas in a disk (if it were in equilibrium) is roughly $kT/mg$, where $T$ is the temperature, $g$ is the gravitational field, $m$ the mean mass of agas particle, and $k$ the Boltzmann constant. If we assume most of the mass is in a thin disk, then Gauss's law for gravitation tells us that that $g = 2\pi G \sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the mass per unit area in the disk. According to Rix & Bovy, $\sigma \simeq 70 M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$ at the location of the Sun ($URL$ If we assume hydrogen gas, then the effective particle mass is that of a proton, and this means the gas scale height is $$ H = 4300 \left(\frac{T}{10^6\ K}\right)\ pc$$ Thus gas hotter than a million degrees will have a very substantial scale height and is not expected to be confined to the Milky Way disk. 

It is known as the nuclear turn-on in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram; the opposite of the nuclear turn-off when hydrogen is exhausted in the core. In actual fact there is no "moment" when the star begins to fuse hydrogen, it is a gradual process. For example, the models of Siess et al. (2001) suggest that a solar mass pre main sequence star gets 0.01% of its luminosity from hydrogen fusion at 2 million years old, 1% after 16 million years, but it is not until it is 56 million years old that 99% of the luminosity comes from hydrogen fusion. 

Straightforwardly no. For a start there are almost no free protons inside a white dwarf. They are all safely locked away in the nuclei of carbon and oxygen nuclei (which are bosonic). There are a few protons near the surface, but not in sufficient numbers to be degenerate. Let us assume though that you were able to build a hydrogen white dwarf that had equal numbers of free protons and electrons. The density at which the electrons become degenerate is set by the requirement that their Fermi (kinetic) energy exceeds $kT$. The Fermi energy is given by $$E_F = \frac{p_F^{2}}{2m} = \left(\frac{3}{8\pi}\right)^{2/3} n^{2/3} \left(\frac{h^2}{2m}\right),$$ where $n$ is the number density (which would be the same for protons and electrons), but $m$ is the mass of a proton or electron, which is different by a factor 1800. Thus for a given white dwarf temperature, the electrons become degenerate at number densities a factor of $(m_p/m_e)^{3/2} = 78,600$ times lower than do protons. Even if we were to compress a hypothetical hydrogen white dwarf to the point where the protons were also degenerate (which for a typical white dwarf interior temperature of $10^{7}$ K, would need mass densities considerably in excess of $10^{12}$ kg/m$^{3}$), the (ideal) degeneracy pressures would then be given by $$ P = \frac{h^2}{20m}\left(\frac{3}{\pi}\right)^{2/3} n^{5/3}$$ and so we immediately see that the degeneracy pressure due to protons would be $\sim 1800$ times less than that due to the same number density of electrons. If we push up to higher densities then both the protons and electrons will become relativistically degenerate. In this case the pressure becomes independent of the particle mass. However, the Fermi energies of the particles would now be high enough ($>1$ GeV !) to block beta decay and instigate neutronisation. The protons and electrons start combining to form neutrons and an n,p,e fluid is formed where the neutrons vastly outnumber the protons and electrons. This in fact prevents the protons ever becoming relativistic, even at neutron star densities, and the contributions of electrons to the pressure is always orders of magnitude higher than for the protons. A handwaving way of understanding this is that the degeneracy pressure depends on the product of the momentum and velocity of the particles. In turn, the momentum of the fermions depends on how much they are compressed through the uncertainty principle. For a given particle number density, the separation $\Delta x$ is the same for protons and electrons and therefore the uncertainty principle says that the $\Delta p \sim \hbar/\Delta x$ of the momentum is also the same. This is another way of saying that the Fermi momentum does not depend on the mass of the fermion; however, for a given fermion momentum, the velocity clearly does! Therefore the degeneracy pressure must be lower by approximately the mass ratio of the fermions 

I would say that it matters not-at-all whether your name is Aardvark or Zygote. Astrophysicists are not stupid, we can see when a large author list has been alphabetised. If anything I would say it is a disadvantage, since a casual glance at an author list might lead someone to think you were the lead author of any paper, even one with just two authors, simply because of your surname. In practice, the tiny minority of author lists are alphabetised in Astrophysics papers. Off the top of my head I can think of the gravitational wave papers by Abbott et al. and the MACHO papers by Alcock et al. Most many-author papers have a nucleus of authors at the start of the work and then a longer list of names, possibly in alphabetical order, of people who contributed to the overall project or mission. Even these papers are a (growing) minority and it is still true that the majority of Astrophysics papers have a relatively small author list ordered by contribution. Finally, I will add another personal opinion. The presence of someone's name on many long-author list papers does not necessarily impress me unless they have lead some of them. It is more impressive for a young scientist to have forged their own path and perhaps written a few lead-authored papers with small author lists or even a sole author paper. Unfortunately, much "big science" does involve big consortia and though it can be exciting for an early-career scientist to be part of such an enterprise, it can be much harder to make your mark outside of that consortium. EDIT: As a brief, empirical check on my answer, I looked at arXiv for 22nd November 2016. There were 66 new astrophysics papers listed. Of these, 29 were written by three or fewer authors. Only five were written by $>10$ authors and only one paper, from the Pierre Auger collaboration, appeared to have an alphabetised author list. Try hard not to laugh - the paper is by Aab, A. et al. Good luck in your efforts to beat that.
