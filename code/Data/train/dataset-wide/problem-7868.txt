In dimension $4$ I feel this should be proved, and let me make a fuzzy attempt. In dimension $4$ Hamiltonian $S^1$-manifolds are all rational or ruled, so except for $\mathbb{C}P^2$ which needs independent check, you may just take an $S^1$-equivariant almost complex structures and consider the self-intersection zero class which is automatically transversal. This gives a fibration where the singular points come from bubblings which should be separated on the base by perturbations. This fibration should be what you want, and the plausibility comes from that if your $S^1$-action comes from transporting the fibers instead of rotating the fibers, then your base needs to rotate, but the singular values prevents you to do so except for some extreme cases where one checks by case study. If this is the only construction in the 4-dimensional case, I feel it very hard to extend to higher dimensions with current techniques. Because if you try to use Donaldson's construction on $4$ dimension, it clearly never give you satisfactory answers because the Donaldson hypersurfaces are usually not spheres, so this line seems not approaching a general argument; while on the other hand, if you give up Donaldson's construction, it is already extremely hard to even just to find a smooth symplectic hypersurface, at least for me personally. 

I am sorry that my question might be stupid for experts, but I really do not know the answer. Let $M$ be a smooth $n$-manifold. We assume that there exists a distance $d$ on $M$ such that $(M,d)$ is a length space and that the Hausdorff $Q$-measure associated to $d$ is Ahlfors $Q$-regular, which means the Hausdorff $Q$-measure of a ball $B(x,r)$ is comparable to $r^Q$. My question is the following: Suppose $M$ is simply connected. Let $E\subset M$ be a closed set. I wonder when will $M\backslash E$ be simply connected. In particular, I am interested in sufficient conditions on $E$ to ensure that $M\backslash E$ is simply connected in terms of Hausdorff dimension/measure. Note that if $M$ is a simply connected domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $M\backslash A$ is simply connected if $H^{n-2}(A)=0$, where $H^{n-2}$ is the Hausdorff $(n-2)$-measure associated to the standard Euclidean distance. I am particularly interested in this result when $M$ is an equi-regular subRiemannian manifold. In the latter case, I know the result holds if $E$ has zero $Q$-capacity. I wonder what is the optimal condition on $E$ to ensure this in terms of Hausdorff measure/dimension. 

For $S^2$ all symplectic diffeomorphisms are hamiltonian, and the symplectomorphism group is homotopy equivalent to $SO(3)$. For other surfaces, I find the papers by Andrew Cotton-Clay helpful, for example $URL$ But of course, if you just want some hands-on non-trivial symplectomorphisms, I think Dehn twists would be interesting enough. 

I came across a new type of gluing in the FOOO paper $URL$ (maybe not so new to experts). The situation is as follows: one considers a relative (to lagrangian) class and want to understand the evaluation maps of the moduli space to the lagrangian. An option is to do the original FOOO thing--Kuranishi structure, multisection perturbation and evaluation; however, if there is a separating contact type hypersurface in the manifold, where the lagrangian entirely lies on one of the pieces, there's another option. I can first do neck-stretching in SFT, then evaluate the fiber product of moduli space involving punctures on the two sides, fiber product taken over evaluation on the punctures where the moduli spaces can be glued. My question is: 

Carnot groups as well as general (equiregular) SubRiemannian manifolds are typical examples of Ahlfors regular metric measure spaces, which are also geodesic. In particular, they are doubling as a metric space. You can find these facts in the lectures of Heinonen Heinonen, Juha Calculus on Carnot groups. Fall School in Analysis (Jyväskylä, 1994), 1–31, Report, 68, Univ. Jyväskylä, Jyväskylä, 1995. or $URL$ 

I want to prove the following fact without using topological degree theory or related algebraic topology Let $h:\overline{B}(0,1)\to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a continuous map such that $|h(x)-x|\leq \delta$ when $|x|=1$. Then $B(0,1-\delta)\subset h(B(0,1))$. The result is obvious if one uses topological degree theory, since $h$ is homotopic to the indentity map when restricted to $B(0,1-\delta)$. Or with more effort, one can use Brouwer fixed point theorem to prove it. Here I want an elementary proof of this fact, which does not involve any algebraic topological concept. 

I think usually the standard approximation arguments gives you the result $C^2(\Omega)\cap C^1(\bar{\Omega})$ and I did not quit see how to reduce to $C^2(\Omega)\cap C^0(\bar{\Omega})$. However, your second question is a good exercise for you to understand the properties of the Green's function. Roughly speaking, $\Delta G(x,y)=\delta_{x-y}$, by the properties of Dirac measure, you can solve the linear equation via (zero boundary case) $$u(x)=\int_\Omega u(y)\Delta G(x,y)dy=\int_\Omega \Delta u(y)G(x,y)dy.$$ When $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$, the above equation clearly tells you $u(x)\to0 $ as $x\in\partial\Omega$. All these facts I mentioned are rather standard and can be found for instance in nice book of Han, Qing; Lin, Fanghua Elliptic partial differential equations. Courant Lecture Notes in Mathematics, 1. New York University, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York; American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 1997. x+144 pp. 

I think this question is a great example of how intuition and the ability to compute go hand in hand. Thanks for asking! Say we have modules M and N. Here `to have' means to have a presentation as the cokernel of a map between free modules. F1' -> F1 -> N -> 0 F2'-> F2 -> M -> 0 where the F's are free. This is a really concrete way of describing the module. Even a computer can understand! And let's say we have a short exact sequence 0-> N -> R -> M -> 0 (these are A-modules; R is not necessarily free). It splits if there is a map from M to R such that composition back to M is the identity. (apply Hom(M,-); the class of the identity in Hom(M,M) is in the image of Hom(M,R) -> Hom(M,M)). Now a map M-> R is given by lifting the generators of M to elements of R. (Previously, they were elements in the cokernel, i.e. equivalence classes modulo N. a map M -> R picks representatives for these classes.) The map M -> R lifts to F2-> R since F2 is free (hence projective). We get a surjection from F1+F2 onto R by sending the gens of F1 to the gens of the submodule N, and sending the gens of F2 to the representatives for the equivalence classes we chose above. Ask: What are the relations among this set of generators of R? Case 1. We were already given a presentation of R. F3' -> F3 -> R -> 0. Then we write our new set of generators in terms of the already existing ones. That is we have a map F1+F2 -> F3. We want a presentation of the image of F1+F2 -> F3 in the quotient of F3' -> F3. So we have reduced the problem to one involving free modules. there are standard algorithms to solve it. for instance, in Macaulay2, the function subquotient() does the trick. Case 2. We do not have a presentation of R; we are in fact trying to come up with such an R. Then we have freedom to define the relations ourselves. We choose the relations among the representatives of the equivalence classes. That is, for each generating relation among the gens of M, we choose an element of the submodule N. In terms of free modules, we choose a map q: F2' -> F1+F2. Let p be the map from F1' to F1 defining N. Then p+q: F1' + F2' -> F1+F2 is a presentation of R. The intuition is we're filling in the upper triangular part of the direct sum map. We can put this in a snake diagram: 0->ker->ker->ker->0 0-> F1'-> F1'+F2' -> F2'-> 0 0-> F1 -> F1 +F2-> F2 -> 0 0-> N-> R -> M -> 0 Here the first two sequences split, and R is by definition the cokernel of the map F1'+F2' -> F1 + F2 we chose. At this point we have presentations for all three terms in sequence 0-> N -> R -> M -> 0, and we have the maps between them in terms of free modules. the next step is to investigate when the sequence splits. First note that the map q: F2' -> F1 + F2 is given by a map from F2'-> F1 and a map F2'-> F2. The part F2'-> F2 is already determined for us. The new part, the new upper triangular part we've filled in, is F2' -> F1. (cf. the previous post: our F2' -> F1 is his S to N). Now if the image of F2' -> F1 is contained in the image of F1' -> F1, i.e. we chose elements in the span of the relations of N-- zero elements in N-- i.e. it lifts to F2 -> F1 (in the previous poster's language, it comes from a map R^G to N) then those elements are eliminated in the cokernel R. (In terms of a basis, we can use the lower block to eliminate the upper-right block.) So we want the image of F2'-> F1 to be nonzero in the quotient N. Again, the subquotient() function in Macaulay2 comes to the rescue. If R is a direct sum then the subquotient is zero. Thank you again for asking!! I hope I have not made too many errors. 

I have a question on Riemannian geometry or CAT(k) geometry, which might be simple for experts. Suppose $M$ is a complete smooth Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded from above by $k>0$. Fix a ball $B\subset M$ with radius less than $\frac{\pi}{2\sqrt{k}}$. Fix three points $P,Q,R\in B$. Denote by $PQ$ the unique geodesic that connects $P$ and $Q$ in $B$ and $QR$ the unique geodesic that connects $P$ and $R$. Let $Q_t\in PQ$ be the $t$-fractional point, that is, $d(p,Q_t)=td(p,Q)$ and $d(Q_t,Q)=(1-t)d(P,Q)$, and let $R_t\in PR$ be the $t$-fractional point as well. I wonder whether it is true that there exists a constant $c(k,t)>0$ such that $$d(Q_t,R_t)\le c(k,t)d(R,Q).$$ In case $k=0$, we know that we can choose $c(k,t)=t$. Any comments or references would be greatly appreciated. 

Usually in mathematics, if an object enjoys too many good properties, then there will be some kind of rigidity result for it. Conformal mappings are perfect in two dimension and they are solutions to the so-called Beltrami system, which is highly over-determined when n>3. Thus, it is very rigid. By a result of Liouville, conformal mappings are restrictions of Mobius transformations in dimenions higher than two. For a proof of this result, I recommend the excellent book by Iwaniec and Martin, Iwaniec, Tadeusz; Martin, Gaven Geometric function theory and non-linear analysis. Oxford Mathematical Monographs. The Clarendon Press, Oxford University Press, New York, 2001. 

I suspect there's another implicit assumption they used but suppressed here, that the evaluation always gives a cycle due to torus action. I do not have a clear idea why the assumption on simple puncture plays a role. The Li-Ruan's paper and settings therein do not seem to be responsible for this assumption. Notice that, in the setting of the above paper, the evaluation should involve a virtual perturbation since the moduli space in question is (a maslov=$2$ disk)+($k$ copies of maslov=$0$ spheres). The following special case should help concretize my question: consider still a toric manifold, where the Kuranishi structure and perturbation seem much easier to construct according to toric FOOO I&II. If one considers a certain contact type hypersurface which is Morse-Bott and invariant under torus action, and an arbitrary classes with maslov=$2$, can one still claim such a gluing result "standard"? 

I suppose this has been used for a while in GW theory, but I am not sure what can be claimed "standard" in this case of Floer homology. According to the above paper, 

My question is the following: let $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a branched covering, namely $f$ is continuous, discrete (each fiber is a discrete subset of $\Omega$) and open (open sets get mapped onto open set), where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a domain. I wonder wether there is any "topological" concept defined on $\Omega$ that is invariant under the branched covering $f$. If we look at the case where $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a homeomorphism, then the linking number (from Knot theory) is a topological invariant for $f$ (Say in $\mathbb{R}^3$, I have a circle linked with circle with link number +1, then its image under a sense-preserving homeomorphism will still have linking number +1 and cannot be -1). I wonder whether there are analogous concept that is invariant for a branched covering instead of a homeomorphism. Motivation for this question: It is well-known due to Hencl and Maly that for a Sobolev homeomorphism $f:\Omega\to \mathbb{R}^3$, the Jacobian of $f$ cannot change sign a.e. in $\Omega$, namely either $J_f\geq 0$ a.e. in $\Omega$ or $J_f\leq 0$ a.e. in $\Omega$. The main tool in their proof is the linking number (of circles) that is invariant under homeomorphism. I want to prove the same result but replace the homeomorphism assumption with the condition that $f$ is a branched covering. Thus I am interested in a kind of invariant for branched coverings. Any suggestions and comments are welcome.
