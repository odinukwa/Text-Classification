I understand your question to mean "must we chose an element $x_n$ for all $n$?". (This is in accordance with the comments.) Answer. Officially, the answer is "Yes", you must chose an element for each $n$. However, as pointed out in the comments, often you can prove this makes no difference if you are allowed to not chose elements. This is true for all classic selective covering properties of type $S_1(A,B)$. For some properties this is not entirely trivial, but still provable. For example, $S_1(\Gamma,\Gamma)=S_{\le 1}(\Gamma,\Gamma)$ because WLOG the covers get finer with $n$. If you think about it, this is the essence of the now-classic proof that $S_1(\Gamma,\Gamma)=S_\text{fin}(\Gamma,\Gamma)$. 

The finite intersection property: If $C_\alpha$ (for $\alpha\in I$) are closed subsets in a compact space, and every finite intersection of $C_\alpha$-s is nonempty, then the whole intersection $\bigcap_{\alpha\in I}C_\alpha$ is nonempty. Proof. Otherwise, the complement $\bigcup_{\alpha\in I}C_\alpha^c$ is an open cover of the space without a finite subcover. You may prefer the version with the $C_\alpha$-s compact and no assumption on the space containing them, but this is the same since we can intersect all $C_\alpha$-s with some fixed $C_{\alpha_0}$. To me, it is surprising that this trivial proof gives such a useful assertion. One may argue that this boils down to De Morgan's Laws, which are also trivial but very useful! 

Like Terry Tao, I find the transience of slides to be a problem. This is one reason why I stopped using slides as such and began using a single continuous-scroll page for each topic. I lecture from the bottom of the page, so students who are behind can still see the top. (I'm also one of those people who mixes the projector and the board, with bullet points and formulas on the projector and worked-out examples on the board, so I don't scroll down the page very quickly. Fortunately I work in a facility where the lighting allows this.) 

A Banach algebra (assumed associative and unital) is precisely a monoid object in the monoidal category of Banach spaces, short linear maps, and the projective tensor product. A Banach coalgebra is then a comonoid object in this monoidal category. It's straightforward to write down what a Banach *-coalgebra is too. It's a little less obvious what a C*-coalgebra is, and I don't know if that term appears in the literature, but I've written down my definition. Generally, the dual space of a coalgebra is an algebra (but not conversely), and that works here too: the dual of a C*-coalgebra is a C*-algebra. But not every C*-algebra arises in this way; obviously, since all of these C*-algebras have preduals (having been explicitly constructed so), they are W*-algebras. But I don't know what other conditions must be satisfied. So my question is, and I'll be grateful for incomplete answers: Which W*-algebras arise (up to abstract isomorphism) as duals of C*-coalgebras? Partial answers: The sequence space $l^\infty$ is the dual of $l^1$, and $l^1$ is a C*-coalgebra. But this doesn't work for $L^\infty(R)$; this is the dual of $L^1(R)$, but I can't make $L^1(R)$ into even a Banach coalgebra (in an appropriate way), essentially because the diagonal in $R^2$ has measure zero. (Unless I've miscalculated something, and I'm trying to do the wrong thing here.) Of course, these are quite limited examples: they're (co)commutative. I'd be grateful for more. 

This question assumes familiarity with combinatorial cardinal characteristics of the continuum. Identify an infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ with its increasing enumeration. Thus, for each natural number $n$, $a(n)$ is the $n$-th element of $a$ in increasing order. This way, every infinite set of a natural number is a member of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$. For $f,g\in\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$, write $f\le^{\infty}g$ if $f(n)\le g(n)$ for infinitely many $n$. That is, if $g\not<^* f$. For an infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$, let $a^{c}$ be its (infinite) complement in $\mathbb{N}$. Thus, $a$ and $a^{c}$ are both in $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$, and the following notion is natural. A set $Y\subseteq\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is bi-nondominating if there is an infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ such that $Y\le^{\infty}a,a^{c}$. That is, for each $f\in Y$ we have that $f\le^{\infty}a$ and $f\le^{\infty}a^{c}$. Definition. $\mathfrak{bidi}$ is the minimal cardinality of a set $Y\subseteq\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ that is not bi-nondominating. That is, such that for each infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$, there is $f\in Y$ such that $a\le^{*}f$ or $a^{c}\le^{*}f$. It follows immediately that $\mathfrak{b}\le\mathfrak{bidi}\le\mathfrak{d}$. It can be shown that if we close the sequences in $Y$ under left shifts, then a witness for $Y$ being bi-nondominating actually reaps $Y$. Thus, $\mathfrak{bidi}\le\mathfrak{r}$, the reaping (or unsplitting) number. Since bounded sets in the Baire space $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ are meager, and the operator $a\mapsto a^{c}$ is a hoemomorphism from the Cantor space $P(\mathbb{N})$ onto itself, we also have that the covering number for meager (or Baire first category) sets, $\mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M})$, is not greater than $\mathfrak{bidi}$. In summary, we have: $$ \max\left\{ \mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M}),\mathfrak{b}\right\} \le\mathfrak{bidi}\le\min\left\{ \mathfrak{r},\mathfrak{d}\right\} . $$ Questions. 1. Is $\mathfrak{bidi}$ a new combinatorial cardinal characteristic of the continuum? 

Although it's a little wordy, there is a method of formalizing things that avoids these theorems. To be sure, theorems such as $\{\{\},\{\{\}\}\}\in\{\{\},\{\{\},\{\{\}\}\}\}$ remain, but that's not junk; however, $2 \in 3$ (or even $2_\mathbb{N} \in 3_\mathbb{N}$) will not be there. Define a natural-number system to be an ordered pair $(N, \sigma)$ such that $\sigma$ is an ordered pair $(z, s)$ such that $z$ is an element of $N$, $s$ is a function from $N$ to $N$, $z$ is not in the range of $s$, $s$ is injective, and the only subset $A$ of $N$ such that $z \in A$ and $s[A] \subseteq A$ is $N$ itself. Given a natural-number system $\mathbb{N} = (N, (z, s))$, let $0_\mathbb{N}$ be $z$, let $1_\mathbb{N}$ be $s(z)$, etc; similarly, you can define $+_\mathbb{N}$, $\times_\mathbb{N}$, etc. You can now prove theorems about natural numbers; such theorems take the form ‘For each natural number system $\mathbb{N}$, […].’, much like theorems about groups take the form ‘For each group $G$, […].’. Of course, number theory is unlike group theory in an important respect, which is that all natural-number systems are isomorphic (indeed uniquely isomorphic). This is certainly worth proving (and first defining), but you don't actually have to prove it to start stating and proving theorems about prime numbers or whatever. You might at least want to prove that a natural-number system exists (which is the only place in all of this that requires the Axiom of Infinity), although strictly speaking you don't even have to do that either; in any case, the system whose existence you choose to prove plays no special role in the rest of the theory. In something like ETCS, of course, one always does something like this to construct natural numbers, which is why ETCS seems to have fewer junk theorems. But then when you construct $\mathbb{R}$ out of $\mathbb{N}$, the junk theorems appear in both formal systems, unless you go through the same rigamarole to define a real-number system, etc. But you can do that. 

Consider for example, in comparison, the law of gravity. Assuming it is true, it is just as spiritual as the natural number 1, or the set of all natural numbers, or the real line, etc. That it predicts something about reality does not make this law itself a part of reality (e.g., you cannot dig it out from anywhere). Thus, its existence is no more physical than that of set theoretic objects. The main difference is that physical laws, predicting reality, can be tested against reality. Set theoretic objects and facts about them can, often, only be tested against the mathematical reality (known facts about other mathematical objects). Perhaps one can think of this as an incremental (or drilling...) process: Reality $\to$ Physics $\to$ Mathematics $\to$ Set theory. I have no expertise in any kind of philosophy, so my answer is necessarily naive, but from the little I read, it seems that deep philosophical investigations rarely make things more clear and are mainly good for having more questions. Given that we need more answers than questions, I do not think the philosophical approach would help much here. 

Localic completion is awesome and is the way to answer your question as asked (which requests a locale). However, a simpler answer for getting the correct (internal) set of $p$-adic numbers (the one whose points are, externally, the $p$-adic valued continuous maps) is simply to complete using all Cauchy nets (or filters) rather than only the sequences (or sequential filters). Simon has stated as much already, but I wanted to extract that fact. It is just not true in constructive mathematics that metric spaces are sequential spaces, so one must always work with all nets and not just restrict to sequences. (Predicative constructivists may have some difficulty with this, of course, although fortunately they can still deal with the locale via a prosite for it.) 

In intuitionistic mathematics, a non-constant function from $ \mathbb R $ to $ \{ 0 , 1 \} $. Many classical theorems can be proved to fail intuitionistically by showing that they imply this or something much like it. (Probably the most common thing is to show that the classical theorem implies the theorem $$ \forall \, x , y \in \mathbb R , \; x = y \; \vee \; x \ne y \text , $$ which doesn't look like the existence of a thing; but this is equivalent to the existence, for each real number $ x $, of a function $ f $ from $ \mathbb R $ to $ \{ 0 , 1 \} $ such that $ f ( y ) = 1 $ iff $ x = y $.) More generally, in constructive mathematics, we don't usually assume that such functions don't exist, but we also understand that we can't prove that they do. So this still demonstrates that classical theorems can't be proved constructively (at least, not without being modified). In a more neutral framework, we might speak of a non-constant continuous function from $ \mathbb R $ to $ \{ 0 , 1 \} $, or of a non-constant computable function from $ \mathbb R $ to $ \{ 0 , 1 \} $. 

Answer copied from the comments: Without MA + not CH, it is consistent that there is a set of reals $X$ such that every subset of $X$ is relatively Borel, but not every subset is relatively $F_\sigma$. This is due to Arnie Miller. – Paul McKenney 

Jech-Prikry: Assume that $2^{\aleph_0}$ is regular and smaller than $2^{\aleph_1}$. If $f(\aleph_1)=2^{\aleph_0}$, then there is an inner model with a measurable cardinal. If $\kappa^{\aleph_0}=\kappa$, then $f(\kappa)=2^\kappa$ (see Hathaway). 

Item 1 follows from the topological interpretation, but can also be proved combinatorially. Blass supplied me with one such proof. This is a cute exercise (or see below). Items 2-3 are immediate. Item 3 was pointed out to me by Blass. Problem. Can the cardinal number $\mathfrak{ufo}$ be identified as a classic combinatorial cardinal characteristic of the continuum? (For me, $\aleph_1$ is definitely a (potential) positive answer.) Here is Blass's proof. I thank him for the permission to include it here. I made tiny changes. If you find errors, this must be my fault. :) Suppose, toward a contradiction, that some ultrafilter $U$ is the union of a countable, strictly increasing sequence of filters $F_n$. For each $n$, pick a set $A_n\in F_{n+1}\setminus F_n$. By intersecting each $A_n$ with all the earlier $A_m$'s, we may assume that the $A_n$ sequence is decreasing (with respect to set-inclusion). Let $D_n$ be the set-difference $A_n\setminus A_{n+1}$; so the sets $D_n$ are pairwise disjoint. Let $X$ be the union of the sets $D_n$ for the even $n$, and let Y be the union the remaining sets $D_n$. Then $$ \mathbb{N}=X\cup Y\cup (\mathbb{N}\setminus A_1)\cup \bigcap_n A_n. $$ The last of these isn't in $U$, because, being a subset of $A_n$, it can't be in $F_n$ for any $n$. And $\mathbb{N}\setminus A_1$ isn't in $U$, because $A_1$ is. So either $X$ or $Y$ is in $U$; without loss of generality, suppose $X$ is in $U$. Then $X$ is in $F_n$ for some $n$, and we may assume that $n$ is odd (just add 1 to $n$ if necessary). So $F_n$ contains $X$ and $A_n$ but not $A_{n+1}$. But $An\setminus A_{n+1}=D_n$ is disjoint from $X$ (because $n$ is odd), which means that $A_{n+1}$ is a superset of the intersection of $X$ and $A_n$. The preceding two sentences contradict the fact that $F_n$ is a filter. 

Well, I've decided to go ahead and use ‘with enough points’. There are a lot of reasons to restrict to $T_0$ spaces, over and above reasons to restrict to sober spaces, and at least within that context having enough points is perfectly symmetric between topological spaces and locales. 

I understand the basics of exterior differential geometry and how to do calculus with exterior differential forms. I know how to use this to justify the notation dy/dx as a literal ratio of the differentials dy and dx (by treating x and y as scalar-valued functions on a 1-dimensional manifold and introducing division formally). I would like to extend this to second derivatives. Ideally, this would justify the notation d2y/dx2 as a literal ratio. I can't do this with the exterior differential, since both d2y and dx ∧ dx are zero in the exterior calculus. It occurs to me that this would work if, instead of exterior differential forms (sections of the exterior bundle), I used sections of the cojet bundle (cojet differential forms). In particular, while degree-2 exterior forms may be written in local coordinates as linear combinations of dxi ∧ dxj for i < j (so on a 1-dimensional manifold the only exterior 2-form is zero), degree-2 cojet forms may be written in local coordinates as linear combinations of d2x and dxi · dxj for i ≤ j (so on a 1-dimensional manifold the cojet 2-forms at a given point form a 2-dimensional space). I know some places to read about cojets (and more so about jets) theoretically, but I don't know where to learn about practical calculations in a cojet calculus analogous to the exterior calculus. In particular, I don't know any reference that introduces the concept of the degree-2 differential operator d2, much less one that gives and proves its basic properties. I've even had to make up the notation ‘d2’ (although you can see where I got it) and the term ‘cojet differential form’. I can work some things out for myself, but I'd rather have the confidence of seeing what others have done and subjected to peer review. (Incidentally, I don't think that it is quite possible to justify d2y/dx2; the correct formula is d2y/dx2 − (dy/dx)(d2x/dx2); we cannot let d2x/dx2 vanish and retain the simplicity of the algebraic rules. It would be better to write ∂2y/∂x2; the point is that this is the coefficient on dx2 in an expansion of d2y, just as ∂y/∂xi is the coefficient of dy on xi when y is a function on a higher-dimensional space. The coefficient of d2y on d2x, which would be ∂2y/∂2x, is simply dy/dx again.) 

I did not conduct an extensive literature search. I would appreciate your pointing out relevant results that are not mentioned here. Question: Are there additional cardinals $\kappa$ for which $f(\kappa)$ can be evaluated in ZFC? (The question also applies to large cadrinals. I do not request that the cardinals provably exist.) Update. Intially, I also asked whether $\kappa^{\aleph_0}=\kappa$ could be weakened to ${\rm cof}([\kappa]^{\aleph_0},\subseteq)=\kappa$. Todd Eisworth reminds in the comments below that the latter hypothesis is true in ZFC for $\aleph_1$. Strangely, I couldn't find an explicit reference for the following. Question. Is it consistent (modulo suitable large cardinals) that $f(\aleph_1)<2^{\aleph_1}$? Assuming that (See Assaf Rinot's comment below), is there an explicit reference for that? Motivation: The values $f(\kappa)$ pop up whenever I study (usually, jointly with colleagues) the character and other cardinal invariants of topological groups. They are unavoidable. (Comment: By no means do I mean that the symbol $f(\kappa)$ should be reserved for the function thus defined. This is just a short, temporary name for brevity.) 

This is not an answer, but is too long for a comment, and may be useful still. Unfortunately, the notion of strongly meager is not well-understood. Do we have any other example of strongly meager sets beyond Sierpinski sets (and some mild generalizations of Sierpinski sets)? As long as we cannot construct interesting examples, the notion is ill-motivated to me. The only two motivations seem to be the analogy you cited with GMS Theorem, and the technical difficulty of handling this notion (which thus makes it challenging for fonds of technique development). There are other natural "duals" of strong measure zero. From the point of view of selection principles, an important dual is Borel-Hurewicz sets: sets having all Borel images in the Baire space bounded. Here too, the main example is a Siepinski set, but also some kinds of $\gamma$-sets (constructed by Todor\v{c}evic using CH) form examples. Interestingly, in Laver's model (where there are no uncountable SMZ set), there are also no nontrivial Borel-Hurewicz sets, that is, ones of cardinality at least the critical cardinality of this property (namely, $\mathfrak{b}$): Point-cofinite covers in Laver's model (with A. Miller), Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society 138 (2010), 3313-3321. Notice that, since $\mathfrak{b}=\aleph_2$ in Laver's model, there are uncountable Borel-Hurewicz sets there, but they are all trivial in the above sense. The modern perspective and accumulated experience suggest that the right question for a notion of smallness for real sets is whether there are nontrivial examples (as defined above, that is, ones of cardinality at least the critical cardinality of this property), not whether there are (possibly trivial) uncountable examples. Thus, in this sense, BC+dBC does hold in Laver's model. :)
