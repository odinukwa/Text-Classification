Is there a nontrivial abelian category $C$ such that both $C$ and $C^{op}$ satisfy AB3-AB5? ("nontrivial" means that there are nonzero objects in $C$) 

Let $X$ be a set, and let $F(X)$ be the free group generated by $X$. I will say that an element of $F(X)$ is positive if it is in the monoid generated by all the conjugates in $F(X)$ of every member of $X$. For example, if $X=\left\{a,b\right\}$ then $a, b, a^2 b a^{-1}$ are positive, but $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$ is not positive. Is there any algorithm that can detect, given an element of $F(X)$, whether is it positive? 

Viete formula gives $\sum_{k=0}^{d} t^k e_{d-k}\left(\alpha_0,\ldots,\alpha_{d-1}\right)=(t+\alpha_1)\ldots(t+\alpha_d).$ Therefore (substituing $t=-(x-d)^2$ and $\alpha_j=(x-j)^2$), LHS is equal to $\prod_{j=0}^{d-1} \left(-(x-d)^2+(x-j)^2\right)= \prod_{j=0}^{d-1} (2x-j-d)(d-j)=d!\prod_{k=d}^{2d-1} (2x-k)$ which is exactly the RHS. 

Let $X\subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a polygon (possibly nonconvex, but not intersecting itself) with all the sides parallel to one of the axes. I am interested on whether $X$ can be tiled by (finitely many) squares. For example, if all the sides of $X$ have rational sides, then it can be tiled by squares. On the other hand, it is known that every rectangle that can be tiled by squares must has that its ratio of height/width is rational. My question is, what are the known obstacles for $X$ to have a tiling by squares? 

It is known that the Dedekind-finite cardinals are closed under addition and multiplication, so one may do arithmetic in them, as opposed to only natural numbers. How much can those two arithmetics be different? For example, can there be a Diophantine equation which is not solvable in the natural numbers but solvable in the Dedekind-finite cardinals? Can there be two nonempty Dedekind finite sets $A,B$ such that $|A|^2=2|B|^2$? 

Koebe–Andreev–Thurston theorem (known also as the circle packing theorem) says that any planar graph can be realized by a set of (interior-) disjoint disks corresponding to vertices, such that two discs are tangent iff the corresponding vertices are connected to each other. Where can I find the/a proof of this theorem, and what should I learn to understand it? I prefer proofs which are elementary, but other proofs are welcome too. 

Let $Q_1, Q_2, R$ be quadratic froms over $\mathbb{Z}$ such that $Q_1 \oplus R \cong Q_2 \oplus R$ as quadratic forms. Is it necessary that $Q_1 \cong Q_2$? I know that by Witt's theorem it is true for fields. 

Obviously, an answer to b) implies an answer for a). I'm not sure how much of my thinking I should put here. But I do know that if char K = p, then we get a homeomorphism of $V$ onto itself by translation for each $v \in V$, which each have finite order p. These are mapped to self-homeomorphisms of $W$ which also have order p, but a priori, they don't "see" any of the algebraic structure of $W$, so I'm not sure this is actually an obstruction. Any thoughts (or references) to proofs or counterexamples would be greatly appreciated. 

Let $\Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0}$ be the set of non-negative real numbers and $\Bbb{R}^{+}$be the set of positive reals. Let us say that a function $f \colon \Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0} \to \Bbb{R}^{+}\_{0}$ is eventually sublinear if $\ \forall r \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \ \exists x_0 \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \colon \forall x \geq x_0, f(x) < rx$. Let $S$ be the set of non-decreasing, eventually sublinear functions (we require no continuity). We define an equivalence relation on $S$: $f \sim g$ if and only if $f$ and $g$ are eventually boundedly close, i.e., $\exists K>0\ \exists x_0 \in \Bbb{R}^{+} \colon \forall x \geq x_0, |f(x)-g(x)| < K$. Denote the set of equivalence classes of $S$ under $\sim$ by $\ T$. Question 1: What is the cardinality of $\ T$? Question 2: Does this cardinality change if we drop the requirement that the functions are non-decreasing? What if the co-domain becomes $\Bbb{R}$? Looking at the set of pairwise non-equivalent sublinear functions $\{f(x) = r*ln(x) \mid r \in \Bbb{R}\}$ shows that $|T|$ must be at least as big as the cardinality of the reals, $\beth_1$. Also, $|T|$ can be no bigger than the cardinality of all functions from $\Bbb{R}$ to $\Bbb{R}$, which is $\beth_2$, the cardinality of the power set of the reals. So there seem to be three options: Option 1: ZFC proves $|T| = \beth_1$. Option 2: ZFC proves $|T| = \beth_2$. Option 3: This question is independent from ZFC (but perhaps not independent from ZFC + Generalized CH?). Different proof ideas involving explicit bounds or forcing are failing me. So does anyone know of an answer and a proof? Thanks. 

Motivation A topological vector space is a vector space over a (topological) field, K, that carries a topology such that addition and scalar multiplication are continuous maps, e.g., all normed vector spaces. Since $\mathbb{C} \approx \mathbb{R}^2$ as topological spaces (with their standard topologies), it's clear that the actual field cannot be detected by the topology alone. Also, cardinality considerations show that any topology on a finite field cannot be homeomorphic to a vector space over a field of characteristic $0$. But that still says nothing about whether there are some topologies, such that, for instance $\mathbb{Z}_p(t) \approx \mathbb{Q}$. I can't find any topological invariants that will distinguish just the fields (as vectors spaces of dimension 1). I suspect that if this problem is solvable, it will be just be topological group considerations, but I can't figure out how to do it.
