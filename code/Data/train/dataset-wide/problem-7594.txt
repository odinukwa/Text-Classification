I'm looking for examples of explicit actions of the infinitesimal group schemes $\alpha_{p^n}$ on schemes (maybe as simple as the affine plane) in characteristic $p$ or mixed characteristic, and their associated quotients. Tried googling but I couldn't find any explicit examples. Any such or references would be much appreciated. 

I'm writing up a paper now where I'm the only author and have a stylistic question. Should I write ''I'' or ''we'' as in ''I/we recall the definition...'' etc. I think this simple example will make everyone understand what I'm talking about. Or should/can I mix? Is this too confusing. Or simply bad? Or ok? I feel that ''we'' is maybe a bit too formal and ''I'' gives the paper a certain personal cosy touch. But in certain respects ''we'' is more ''we go through this ordeal together you and I, dear reader'', where ordeal can mean anything in a whole spectrum of things. You know what I'm saying. So? 

Oh, there are many papers recently devoted to $N$-complexes, in particular in connection with theoretical physics. A lot of these papers have simplicial stuff in it. I don't have access to MathSciNet now so some of my suggestions you have to look up yourself as I sometimes don't know the exact titles. Here goes: 

Since your interest is in deformation theory I would advise you to have a look at "Introduction to singularities and deformations" by Greul, Lossen and Shushtin. The first part of the book treats complex analytic geometry (complex space germs) and the second their deformation theory. There's also a survey paper by Palamodov "Deformations of complex spaces" in Encyclopedia of Mathematics (Springer) which treats some foundational material as well. Good luck! 

I do not know your location, but the article in question, "On Functions of Bounded Mean Oscillation" (1961), has been scanned and posted by Wiley and is available by subscription from some universities. The original paper makes no direct mention of Hardy spaces or PDEs. For motivation, they cite a paper by John and a paper by Moser in the same issue of the journal, and they reprove a basic functional analysis result of Weiss and Zygmund. Fritz John's paper was an analysis of the polar decomposition of the derivative of a diffeomorphism of an n-dimensional shape. (I mean a polar decomposition in the sense of linear algebra: Every square real matrix is the product of a symmetric matrix and a rotation matrix.) What John had in mind was estimates for deformation strain of solid materials. (Interestingly, he had an Air Force grant. Maybe John or the grant officers were thinking of aircraft parts.) Both John's paper and John-Nirenberg have the flavor of geometric analysis and nuts-and-bolts Lp estimates. Moser's paper establishes the Harnack inequality for solutions to elliptic PDEs. I suppose that Moser was the one who connected the new definition of BMO to PDEs. At the time, John and Nirenberg were at NYU, and Moser was either there or soon to arrive. So these were people in close correspondence. 

To expand a little on this alternate answer that was studied by David Aldous: Suppose that, instead of the process that Ian suggested, you take a random spanning tree of the complete graph on $n$ vertices. Or more properly, you take the ensemble of spanning trees of the complete graph, and then attempt a limit of those ensembles as $n \to \infty$. You can obtain a good ensemble in that limit by looking, for each $k$, at the $k$-neighborhood (in the tree) of a marked vertex, and then sending $k$ to infinity after $n$ is sent to infinity. Then you get a well-defined ensemble of infinite rooted trees, which is hopefuless the same as what Aldous studies. I think that it is a valid model of what is sometimes called "the" random tree. For instance, what is the probability that the root is a leaf? Using the formula that there are $n^{n-2}$ labelled trees on $n$ vertices, you can compute that it is $1/e$. If I set up the tree properly, then it would mean that $1/e$ of the vertices are leaves, almost surely. "The" random tree in this sense is statistically the same everywhere, to every finite size of neighborhood. However, I think that it can't be the same tree out to infinity every time, because it contains an infinite amount of data to distinguish samples. For instance the spacing between leaves is an infinite amount of data. I'm not expert enough to arrive at this rigorously, but I believe that a "translation invariant" random process that really gives you the same tree every time would have to give you a boring tree with the same valence everywhere. (This is what I meant by my joke that it would be barking up the wrong tree.) On the other hand, if you do make a "translation invariant" ensemble of trees, then it could be "the" tree in the sense that you might recover all of the local statistics of the entire ensemble just by average over one typical sample. An analogue that I understand rather better is the Penrose tiling. It is "the" Penrose tiling in the sense that any one Penrose tiling has the local statistics of all Penrose tilings. On the other hand, there are uncountably many different Penrose tilings. (In a natural sense, the Penrose tilings form an ergodic family; they come from a foliation of an $A_4$-shaped torus by parallel planes.) 

Let $M$ be an algebraic family of isocrystals over a base scheme $R/\mathbb{Q}_p$ (not a rigid analytic space). The question is: is the set of weakly admissible points (i.e., the points $r\in R$ over which $M$ is weakly admissible) Zariski closed or open (or neither)? The answer might be very simple and/or well-known, but I haven't been able to figure it out. Thanks for any help! 

I'm interested in covers of modular curves (especially cyclic covers) and I'm sure there's a lot of information out there available on this topic. However, I'm unable to locate any literature (on Google or MathSciNet). Anyone has any references? Edit: In response to the comment below, I'm particularly interested in the local properties of the cover. For example, how, if at all, Heegner points or supersingular points, translate into properties of the fibers over these points. 

From the works of Borel and Quillen there is a connection between the $K$-theory of the ring of integers $\mathfrak{o}_K$ in a number field $K$ and the arithmetic of the number field. In fact, it is well known that 

I have an algebra $A$ that is finite over its centre $Z(A)$ and I want to compute the Azumaya locus of $Z(A)$ (or equivalently, its ramification locus). Looking in McConnell-Robson Noncommutative Noetherian rings (13.7.2 together with the Artin-Procesi theorem, 13.7.14) gives some criterium that can be used. However, this seems rather difficult since it means computing PI-degrees or the central polynomial $g_n$ which seems to me quite complicated. Are there any other, easy ways to compute the Azumaya locus? As should be clear by the question, I'm very far from an expert in this area, so the question might be very naive or elementary. 

1) Consider a fixed list of boats in the limit of a large grid. This is a model of a battle in the open Pacific, you know; it's not supposed to be Pearl Harbor. Then the inclusion-exclusion formula is much faster than a back-tracking search. Count all of the arrangements of ships, then add or subtract a term for each pattern of intersection when the ships have had an accident. Each term is a product of squares. Indeed, it is an explicit polynomial in the grid size. 2) As Gjergji says, Kasteleyn's method is only for perfect matchings. Even if the ships were all PT boats, you would not have a determinant formula unless they covered the whole grid. If you truly do want to count saturated traffic jams of PT boats, Kasteleyn himself evaluated the determinant for rectangles and established a trigonometric product formula. 3) If anyone wants to define a generalized $q$-Battleship with an interpretation over $\mathbb{F}_q$ â€” no, thank you! (You can make the product formula for each term work, but don't bother.) 

Now that I have thought about the question some more, I can give a better answer. I have a remark about how to search for these resolutions in general, and a construction that leads to many examples. First, every permutation module is part of many exact sequences of permutation modules in which the subgroup is trivial: $$\cdots \to R[G]^{n_2} \to R[G]^{n_1} \to R[G/H] \to 0.$$ The reason is very simple and standard: Any exact complex of this type is by definition a free resolution. The way that you make a free resolution is that there is some intermediate target or kernel $K$, and you can send the generators $1 \in R[G]$ to some spanning set of $K$. Usually the resolution is infinite, but with standard linear algebra you can search for a finite solution when there is one. This observation generalizes to other permutation modules. There is a part of induction-restriction reciprocity that holds over any ring. Namely, $$\text{Hom}_G(R[G/H],M) \cong \text{Hom}_H(I,M),$$ where $I$ is the trivial representation. This relation is a generalization of the proof that a free module is projective. So if there is a finite permutation resolution of a module $M$ (which could be the kernel of some incomplete sequence of permutation modules), you can search for it in the same way that you search for free resolutions. Second (and I suspect that readers will like this answer better), you can obtain many examples from the chain homology complex of a finite CW complex $K$ with an action of $G$. In order to make everything match, let's consider a slight generalization of a permutation module, not just $R[G/H]$ but also a module $R[G/H]_\chi$ induced from a character $$\chi:H \to \{1,-1\}.$$ The basic idea is not hard: Each term $C_n(K)$ is a direct sum of signed permutation modules of $G$, because $G$ acts on the cells. If a cell $c$ has stabilizer $H$, then it makes an orbit equivalent to $G/H$, and we can define $\chi$ by examining which elements of $H$ flip over $c$. If $K$ happens to have the same $R$-homology as a point, then you can augment its chain complex by the trivial module. Or if it is an $R$-homology sphere, you can augment its chain complex at both ends. If you don't like the signed permutation modules, you can subdivide the cell $c$ to get rid of them, or work in characteristic 2. If $K$ is a line segment and $G = C_2$ acts by reflecting it, the result is Leonid's first example. If $K$ is a polygon with $n$ sides and $G = C_n$ acts by rotation, the result is Leonid's second example. If $K$ is a polygonal tiling of the 2-sphere and $G$ is a rotation group that acts on $K$ without reversing edges, the result is a new example. For instance you can take a dodecahedron graph and divide each edge into two edges. Again, the point of splitting the edges is just to get rid of the signed permutation modules. Every finite group $G$ acts faithfully on a sphere of some dimension, because $G$ has a faithful linear representation. So there are many sphere examples for every finite group. At first glance, the second answer is a type of construction. In many cases, it is also an interpretation of a chain complex $C$, because if you have $C$ you can try to build a CW complex to represent it. In order to be an augmented chain complex, $C$ needs to end in the trivial module $I$. If it ends in something else, you can concatenate with $$0 \to I \to I \to 0.$$ The differentials of $C$ also need to have integer matrices. 

Question 1: The main reference on algebraic stacks (Laumon and Moret--Bailly) defines a separable algebraic stack as one having universally closed diagonal. For schemes separability is simply defined by the condition that the diagonal is a closed immersion. Why this difference? Question 2: Presentations of algebraic stacks are defined (in LMB) as morphisms (with some properties) $X\to\mathscr{X}$ with $X$ an algebraic space. What does one lose by only considering schemes $X$ instead? These questions are certainly well-known to experts in stack theory and I know there are a few around on MO, so I'm hopeful that I will be sufficiently enlightened. 

It is well-known what the $p^n$-cyclotomic extensions (i.e., adjoining $p^n$-th roots of unity) of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ are (see Serre, Local fields for instance). However, assume now that $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is an arbitrary finite extension. What can now be said about the $p^n$-cyclotomic extensions of $K$? It is clear that this is a harder problem and I haven't been able to find any literature on this but I'm sure that it's out there. At least some cases (for instance, the case $K/\mathbb{Q}_p$ unramified should be similar to the "classical case" I think). Edit: I should have specified what I mean by "What can be said...?". What I'm interested in in particular is the ramification groups and the jumps in the ramification filtration. /Daniel 

I'm a bit confused concerning tamely ramified covers of arithmetic schemes. I guess they would reduce to tamely ramified extensions of number fields, but they don't seem to do so. Let me elaborate: First of all, let me recall the standard definition of tamely ramified covers of arithmetic schemes (by which we mean connected, flat, regular schemes of finite type over a Dedekind domain, or $\mathbb{Z}$ if someone prefer this). Let $D$ be a divisor on $S$ of an arithmetic cover $X\to S=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$, where $A$ is a Dedekind domain. Then $X\to S$ is said to be tamely ramified along $D$ if $X\times_S (S\setminus D)\to (S\setminus D)$ is finite and Ã©tale and tamely ramified along $D$. Now, $X$ being connected and Ã©tale over $S\setminus D$ means that it is actually a $G:=\mathrm{Aut}_S(X)$-torsor (see Milne, Ã‰tale cohomology, page 40), that is, a Galois cover. Since being a $G$-torsor implies that $G$ acts freely and transitively on the fibers, the number of closed points in the fiber is equal to the order of the group $G$. But this means that the fibers all have the same number of points over $S\setminus D$. Ok, so far so good. Restricting to rings of integers in Galois number fields is where my problem begins. So, let $X=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathfrak{o}_L)\to S=\mathrm{Spec}(\mathfrak{o}_K)$ be a cover of the associated arithmetic schemes to $L/K$. In this case, a divisor $D$ is a $\mathit{finite}$ sum $\sum_\mathfrak{p} a_\mathfrak{p} \mathfrak{p}$, $a_i\in \mathbb{Z}$. So $X\to S$ being tamely ramified along $D$ means that $L/K$ is at most tamely ramified at the primes in $D$. Outside $D$, the primes can be unramified, inert and completely split (in $L$). $\mathit{However}$, the only possibility, comparing with tamely ramified coverings of arithmetic schemes is that $\mathfrak{p}\in S\setminus D$ is completely split, but there are infinitely many unramified and inert primes by the Cebotarev density theorem. What the heck am I missing? 

For one-dimensional random walk, it is well-known that if the walk goes for $n$ steps, with constant probability it ends within $\pm\sqrt{n}$. What is the bound, in terms of $n$, such that if the walk goes for $n$ steps, with constant probability it always stays within that bound? It is probably no longer on the order of $\sqrt{n}$, but is it still less than the order of $n$? 

Up to how many subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,2n\}$ of size $n$ can we choose so that each pair has an intersection of size at least two? The original ErdÅ‘s-Ko-Rado paper shows that taking all subsets that contain two fixed elements (thus yielding $\binom{2n-2}{n-2}$ subsets) is not necessarily optimal, but doesn't show what is optimal. What is known about this problem? 

Kneser's conjecture states that the chromatic number of the Kneser graph $KG(n,k)$ is $n-2k+2$. A simple proof using topological methods was given by BÃ¡rÃ¡ny, and an involved combinatorial proof by MatouÅ¡ek. If we only consider the special case $KG(2n,n-1)$, i.e., the vertices are subsets of size $n-1$ of $\{1,2,\dots,2n\}$ and the chromatic number is $2n-2(n-1)+2=4$, is there a simple combinatorial proof for this? 

Let $n,k$ be any positive integers. What is the lowest $r$ (possibly depending on $n,k$) such that given real numbers $0\leq a_1,\dots,a_n\leq 1$, it is always possible to partition them into $k$ blocks, where each block contains consecutive elements of the sequence, so that the sums of any two blocks differ by at most $r$? Taking the example when $a_1=1$ and $a_2=\dots=a_n=0$, we need $r\geq 1$. On the other hand, $r\leq 2$ as we can use an algorithm where we process numbers from left to right and create a new block each time the total sum exceeds $\frac{i}{k}(a_1+\dots+a_n)$ for $1\leq i\leq n-1$. I suspect this problem must have been studied before. Are there any references? 

You can obtain a complete heuristic picture of what is going, by supposing that quadratic residues (as suggested by Laurent) are the only likely obstruction to getting the next prime. More precisely, if you let $Q_n = \prod_{k \le n} q_k$ be the product of all of the primes discovered so far, then you can let $p_{n+1} = p$ be the first remaining prime such that $Q_n$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$, assuming Denis' first proposal. Or, assuming Denis' second proposal, you can let $p$ be the first remaining prime such that either $Q_n$ or $-Q_n$ is a quadratic residue mod $p$. (Thus it will simply be the next prime if that prime happens to be 3 mod 4.) Or, assuming that you only use the sum formula, you would only check $-Q_n$. Then experimentally, $q_{n+1} = p_{n+1}$ in all three cases. This describes the sequence that Charles obtained, which I also obtained (at least the first half of it) with a Sage program. 

One rigorous idea which is similar to your question is to look for the largest "transversal" of the matrix. A transversal is a collection of entries of the matrix with one entry from each row and column. The terms in the determinant of the matrix are multiplicative transversals, but for this question, you would be interested in the maximum additive transversal. There are polynomial time algorithms to find the largest transversal. You can view it as the optimum marriage problem, or as a min-cut, max-flow problem, but it ultimately comes from the fact that you are maximizing a linear functional (the value of the transversal) on the Birkhoff polytope, which is the convex hull of the permutation matrices. As such, it is a linear programming problem. The remaining question is how best to speed it up further, using the fact that it is a special case rather than general linear programming. There is a noted paper on this subject, On Algorithms for Obtaining a Maximum Transversal, by Duff. Note that the question isn't an either-or between the diagonal and the anti-diagonal. There are many things that a transversal can do other than be close to the diagonal or anti-diagonal. Even so, you can look at how close the transversal is to one or the other extreme. For instance, you can look at its inversion number. The diagonal has the smallest inversion number, 0, while the antidiagonal has the unique largest inversion number, $n(n-1)/2$. A slightly different idea is to look at correlations between the inversion number and the value of the transversal. I think some types of correlation can also be computed in polynomial time.
