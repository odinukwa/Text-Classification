Did you consider the degree to radian conversion and vice versa? There seems to be something like that happening. Note that -0.83 is in degrees - which is the correction for the size of the sun and refraction effects at horizon. (More details here: $URL$ At latitude 38 N, there shouldn't be any day where sunrise/sunset is not defined. Also, Hour Angle at any time is the time since culmination (culmination is the passing of a body through the meridian; meridian is the great circle passing through the North cardinal point, North Pole, Zenith and South cardinal point. In this case, Hour Angle gives the time between sunrise and noon (i.e. culmination of the sun), or noon and sunset. 

Looks like you can measure the cosmological redshift of quasars using that equipment and an 14" reflector: $URL$ (halfway down the page) So the answer appears to be yes, you can do it, assuming that page isn't a total fabrication. Seems plausible to me: the redshift of that quasar is sizable at 0.15 (though that's small for a quasar), which means that the spectral lines will be shifted by something like 15%. So you don't need to have a very fine diffraction grating to see the shift. And that quasar is pretty bright for a quasar, at magnitude 13, so you can easily spot it with a good scope. Sounds like a fun project! 

Correct. Because light has an E=hf wave nature. The speed of a wave depends on the medium it's passing through, not on the speed of the emitter. 

No. Einstein's figure is twice Newton's because of the wave nature of matter. Check out Ned Wright's deflection and delay article: He says this: "Newtonian mechanics predicts that a particle traveling at the speed of light which just grazes the edge of the Sun will be deflected by 0.875 seconds of arc". But that's a particle such as an electron, which we might have created from light in pair production. Pair production "often refers specifically to a photon creating an electron-positron pair". Obviously an electron isn't the same thing as a photon. One essential difference is mass, another is charge, and another is the way it's deflected by gravity. If you threw an electron fast past the Sun, nearly as fast as light, its deflection would be half the deflection of a photon. You can understand why by thinking what would happen if you trapped the photon in a gedanken mirror-box such that it was going round and round a square path. Then if you put it in a gravitational field the light would be deflected like this: 

I would like to point out that any information (even quantum mechanical) travels at most at the speed of light. (There are some problems with entangled systems etc, but we can assume most systems to not be entangled, which is a fair assumption, imo). So, if you consider the age of the universe to be finite, any point will have only finitely many overlapping wavefunctions (those within the range of visibility, and the probability can be very very small at most points). So that means that there is never an infinite amount of atoms in the visible region at any finite time, meaning that the density never reaches infinity (or does so only at t=inf). 

I'm afraid I don't know why it's moving. Perhaps it's because the Universe is full of things moving in fairly random directions. Like a gas. 

Nothing. The coordinate speed of light is zero at that location, which means that by our clocks, it takes forever to see anything. So the falling observer hasn't seen anything yet, and he never ever will. IMHO it's worth reading the mathspages Formation and Growth of Black Holes and paying attention to the frozen star interpretation: "Incidentally, we should perhaps qualify our dismissal of the 'frozen star' interpretation, because it does (arguably) give a servicable account of phenomena outside the event horizon, at least for an eternal static configuration. Historically the two most common conceptual models for general relativity have been the "geometric interpretation" (as originally conceived by Einstein) and the "field interpretation" (patterned after the quantum field theories of the other fundamental interactions). These two views are operationally equivalent outside event horizons, but they tend to lead to different conceptions of the limit of gravitational collapse. According to the field interpretation, a clock runs increasingly slowly as it approaches the event horizon (due to the strength of the field), and the natural "limit" of this process is that the clock asymptotically approaches "full stop" (i.e., running at a rate of zero). It continues to exist for the rest of time, but it's "frozen" due to the strength of the gravitational field. Within this conceptual framework there's nothing more to be said about the clock's existence..." The author doesn't favour it, but it squares with what Einstein said about the speed of light varying with gravitational potential. The other interpretation doesn't. And note that Einstein didn't refer to the "coordinate" speed of light. He simply referred to the speed of light. So we can reasonably say that at the event horizon, the speed of light is zero, and that this is why a vertical light beam can't get out. The distant observer sees the infalling observer freeze at the event horizon. But the infalling observer doesn't see himself as frozen, because the speed of light at that location is zero. He sees nothing. NB: SR time dilation is symmetrical, but GR time dilation isn't. If you and I passed each other in gravity-free space at some relativistic speed, we would each claim that the other's clock was slower. But when we're at different elevations, we both agree that the lower clock is going slower. 

I...think you've got it backwards? Slow-roll inflation is alive and well, unlike models which involve tunneling between two vacua. The model of inflation first proposed by Alan Guth back in 1980 was a tunneling model. But it had a serious problem: it didn't reheat. Tunneling from a false vacuum to a true one (or a lower-energy false one) wouldn't release any radiation. And we need that radiation, because we are that radiation, cooled down and condensed after nearly 14 billion years of expansion. The solution was slow-roll inflation: as you mentioned in your question, rolling down the potential well releases a great deal of energy, which in turn leads to the wide variety of matter and radiation in the universe today. Slow-roll inflation also does a nice job of predicting the tiny density fluctuations in the early universe that seeded the formation of all the structures in the universe. Wikipedia has more on all of this. A small disclaimer: there's a lot of inflationary models out there in the literature (there's a hilarious partial list in footnote 3 of this excellent paper by Yadav and Wandelt), and for all I know, one or more of them involve vacuum decay. But the dominant paradigm for inflation today is definitely slow-roll. 

That's right, it uses gravity to "explain" gravity, so it isn't ideal. However there is a way to understand it, and IMHO it's simpler than you think. 

It's popscience rubbish I'm afraid. Hawking was always coming out with things like that, and few would criticise him because of the wheelchair. Those that did tended not to get any publicity. 

If I was covered in lights, I would emit light in all directions, and you would see me because some of that light goes into your eye. The Andomeda galaxy is similar. 

Alternatively see this PhysicsFAQ article by Don Koks: "this difference in speeds is precisely that referred to above by ceiling and floor observers". He's referring to the way Einstein said light curves because the speed of light varies with position. See the Einstein digital papers for examples of that. Here's one from 1920, see the second paragraph: 

My topological defect cosmology is a little rusty, but I'm pretty sure this is how it goes. Start with the fluid equation, $$ \dot{\rho} + 3 {\dot{a} \over a} \left( \rho + p \right) = 0, $$ and the equation of state, $$ p = w \rho. $$ Plug the equation of state into the fluid equation, assume a constant $w$, and you'll find $$ \rho \propto a^{-3(1 + w)}. $$ Now we'll find $\rho(a)$ for strings and sheets, and read $w$ off of them. For cosmic strings, $\rho$ is $$ \rho_{\rm string} = \sum^N_i {\lambda L_i \over V}, $$ where $N$ is the number of strings in our cosmic horizon, $\lambda$ is the linear density of the strings, and $L_i$ is the length of each string. Here's the key: we've got to assume the length of any cosmic string scales with the expansion of the universe, since they're topological defects. Given that assumption, we can get the dependence of $\rho_{\rm string}$ on $a$: $$ \rho_{\rm string}(a) \propto {a \over a^3} = a^{-2}. $$ Thus, $$ 2 = 3(1 + w_{\rm string}), $$ and $w_{\rm string} = -{1 \over 3}$. Similarly, for domain walls, $\rho$ is $$ \rho_{\rm wall} = \sum^N_i {\sigma A_i \over V}, $$ and since $A_i \propto a^2$, we get $w_{\rm wall} = -{2 \over 3}$. Hope that helps! 

Not to my knowledge. Where did you hear that? I don't think it's true, because if it was you could make the same claim about any massive body. 

Like I said, everything is possible. But I will say no, the universe is expanding because of dark energy, not because of gravity. I rather like Erwin Schrödinger’s cosmic pressure myself. See the 2014 Cambridge companion to Einstein by Michel Janssen and ‎Christoph Lehner: “Schrödinger [1918] had pointed out another way of treating the cosmological constant: moving it from the left-hand side of Equation [7], where it represents a contribution to space-time curvature, to the right-hand side, where it represents a contribution to the energy-matter distribution. Then it would correspond physically to a kind of cosmic pressure”. Unfortunately Einstein didn’t like it. You can read more in Alex Harvey’s 2012 paper How Einstein Discovered Dark Energy. He gives a translation of Schrödinger’s paper and refers to Einstein’s response. If you were to ask a modern cosmologist, I think the answer would be that Schrödinger was pretty close to the mark.
