What do we mean by hyper prime numbers? Well, roughly speaking they are natural numbers which are prime with respect to hyperoperators in arithmetic such as exponentiation, tetration, pentation, et cetera. The common soul of these generalized prime numbers is their irreducibility to the smaller numbers with respect to the given hyperoperator; the same property that distinguishes usual primes from other natural numbers. In fact, such numbers don't arise as a non-trivial combination of smaller building blocks. The underlying combination method could be multiplication, exponentiation or any other hyperoperation. 

Ultrapower of a structure is a very flexible mathematical creature in comparison with the ground structure and its ordinary products. Depending on the nature of ground structure and the good properties of ultrafilter, it is often manageable to give useful properties to ultrapower. Interestingly in some papers and theses, ultrapower of a forcing notion $\mathbb{P}$ by an ultrafilter $U$ coming from a special large cardinal $\kappa$ as the index set (e.g. $\kappa$ measurable) appeared as a useful tool for dealing with different types of consistency results (e.g. consistency of some relations between cardinal characteristics). For instance see the following references: 

The counterexample certainly shows that fast function forcing for $\kappa$ a Mahlo cardinal isn’t $\kappa$-c.c. (let alone $\kappa$-Knaster). However, as best as I can tell, it doesn’t pose a problem for the remainder of the arguments of the paper. The reason is that we use this false fact only in two places. These occur on page 920, when we infer that $\kappa$ isn’t measurable in $M[H]$, and when we infer that $M[H]$ is closed under $\kappa$ sequences inside $V[G]$. To infer that $\kappa$ isn’t measurable in $M[H]$, simply introduce a gap at $\aleph_1$ into the fast function forcing (e.g., begin by adding one Cohen real and then define the fast function forcing as we did earlier). We may then infer by Hamkins’ Gap Forcing Theorem that the fast function forcing doesn’t make $\kappa$ measurable in $M[G]$. This is since $G$ is $M$-generic over a partial ordering containing a very low gap. Consequently, since $\kappa$ wasn’t measurable in $M$, it can’t be measurable in $M[G]$. It then follows, as we point out in our paper, that $\kappa$ isn’t measurable in $M[H]$. Note that Joel himself mentions this idea of introducing a very low gap on page 107 of his lottery preparation paper (Remark on Gap Forcing 1.2). To infer that $M[H]$ is closed under $\kappa$-sequences inside $V[G]$, as we mentioned, it suffices to show that $V[G] \models ON^\kappa \subseteq M[G]$. However, even though fast function forcing isn’t $\kappa$-c.c., because $\kappa$ is Mahlo and hence inaccessible, it is trivially $\kappa^+$-c.c. This is since as Joel mentions on page 106 of his lottery preparation paper, we assume under these circumstances that a condition has the size less than $\kappa$. Thus, fast function forcing has cardinality $\kappa$. It then follows that because $V \models M^\kappa \subseteq M$ and we are forcing with a $\kappa^+$-c.c. poset, $V[G] \models ON^\kappa \subseteq M[G]$. Arthur Apter 

Such controversial claims often provoke intense arguments among the mathematicians. The question is how to settle them once for all. Indeed, a rigorous approach towards verification of any such social claim is to mathematically analyze the large mathematical databases such as Arxiv, MathSciNet, or MathOverflow in order to extract general patterns including the distribution of research topics, possible changes in mathematical research fashion and evaluating the interaction and intersection of various mathematical disciplines with each other. These motivations lead to the following general question: 

What on Earth do Russian Matryoshka dolls have in common with large cardinal axioms?! Well, the answer lies in Jónsson algebras! Here is how: As illustrated in the pictures, a Matryoshka set is a self-replicating container in which the mother doll contains a similar copy of itself. This sub-doll also contains a rather smaller similar copy of itself and so on. The dolls in a Matryoshka set could be completely isomorphic in shape (often depicted as a chubby Russian girl wearing Sarafan, the beautiful Persian-named traditional Russian dress) or with some slight differences in spite of general similarity (e.g. Different species of Taiga). As the allegory suggests, the Matryoshka phenomenon is not uncommon in mathematics. There are (infinite) self-replicating mathematical structures which contain some proper isomorphic copies of themselves or at least have a fairly similar (e.g. elementary) proper sub-structures of the same size as the mother structure. Jónsson algebras provide an iconic example of this type. 

According to the following fact, it turns out that the demand for every infinite first-order structure in a countable language to have a proper sub-structure of the same size (i.e. non-existence of Jónsson algebras) has the large cardinal strength of a Jónsson cardinal which is a fairly strong large cardinal assumption incompatible with the Axiom of Constructibility. 

Forcing construction in set theory leads to a new understanding of the mathematical (multi)universe by providing a machinery through which one can construct new models of the universe from the existing ones in a fairly controlled and comprehensible way and connect them to one another through forcing extensions. Since the very beginning, the true nature of this rather bizarre construction method has been a matter of debate. A widely accepted (?) analogy emphasizes on a degree of similarity between forcing method in set theory and field extensions in Galois theory where one constructs new fields using the existing ones by adding new elements. Besides some papers and textbooks, a good description of this analogy could be found in this MathOverflow good oldie: Forcing as a new chapter of Galois Theory?. However, as Dorais mentioned in his answer, despite the undeniable similarity, this analogy is not as perfect as what it seems at the first glance. So, forcing is not a one hundred percent field extension-like construction anyway. This fact causes some confusion concerning the possible translation of Galois theory machinery into the language of forcing and set theory. It is often not immediately clear what the forcing analogy of a given notion in the field extensions would be. Also, sometimes there is more than one approach towards defining a corresponding Galois theoretic notion in forcing so that one needs to decide which the natural one is. One such central concept in Galois theory is the notion of the degree of a field extension, that is the dimension of the extended field while viewed as a vector space over the ground field. The question that arises here is whether there is any corresponding well-defined, well-behaved and natural similar notion in set-theoretic forcing. One may think if a forcing extension could be viewed as a kind of vector space-like structure over the ground model. In this sense, there might be a kind of basis associated with any such pair of models which itself may satisfy some uniqueness properties that give rise to the existence of a well-defined notion of (relative) dimension of a generic forcing extension with respect to its ground model. Our axiomatic expectations of the possible behavior of any such notion of basis/dimension is also an interesting topic to explore even before defining any such notion. Of course, we need them to behave as natural as possible and resemble their Galois theoretic counterparts fairly closely. 

Note that we are not limiting ourselves to the first order structures or structures in countable language. The question is considering the possible existence of such a characterization for large cardinal axioms anywhere in mathematics where a theory around certain type of "mathematical structures" (whatever it means depending on the context, say functional space or a manifold) evolves. 

One also might be interested in taking a look at the following papers which shed some light on the way forcing, Cohen reals, ultrafilters and various set theoretic concepts and tools play role in connection with some problems of quantum physics including hidden variables: 

Intuitively one can tame the bad properties of $\mathbb{P}$ in its ultrapower by throwing the bad points out of the ulterfilter and keeping the others in tact. Also in ultrapower forcing usually good properties of $\mathbb{P}$ (e.g. chain condition) could be preserved under ultrapower (e.g. using a $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter over index $\kappa$) while such properties might be affected by usual forcing products. Here I would like to ask about more examples of using ultrapower of a forcing notion as a forcing notion, for obtaining consistency results in different realms of set theory, in order to get a better idea of the type of consistency statements which could be obtained via ultrapower forcing. 

It is likely that some journal ranking organizations have already conducted some research along these lines but I haven't seen any outline so far. It is also interesting if the research has been done in a comparative way which allows one to compare the general characteristics of math community with its other counterparts, say physics or biology. 

As a remark it is worth mentioning that not all partitions of the infinite plane into $n\times n$ blocks are in the form of a perfect grid. For example, see the left picture in the following diagram which is a partition of the plane via $n\times n$ blocks different from a grid of $n\times n$ blocks (right): 

So, for the sake of completeness, one may reduce the grid partition condition in question 2 to merely a partition of the infinite plane into $n\times n$ blocks: 

Roughly speaking, a knight may follow the king's pattern by completing a knight's tour on an $n\times n$ block and then moving to the next block in the spiral order. For instance, in the below picture each square represents a certain $n\times n$ part of the $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$ plane and the blue path is a knight tour performed in that particular block. It is connected to a point in the neighbor blocks with a knight move. 

I couldn't find much along these lines in the literature except a short unpublished note of Golshani in which he takes a Galois theoretic approach towards dimension in forcing by dealing with mutually generic sequences and the chain of forcing extensions. It also shares many features with Hamkins' set-theoretic geology project. However, this notion of forcing dimension seems not to be complete enough to cover all aspects of a vector space view towards generic extensions but could be a really good starting point anyway. Remark. As Peter stated in his comment, absoluteness would be an issue while defining a notion of (relative) dimension in the set-theoretic multiverse. One may ask, from whose perspective are you trying to calculate the relative dimension of two set-theoretic universes and why? In fact, due to the highly contradictory views of different models of $\sf ZFC$ towards anything beyond the narrow scope of universally absolute properties, there is not more than a little hope to obtain an absolute notion of forcing dimension after all. However, one may argue that absoluteness is not a crucial condition in the long list of our expectations from a possible natural definition of dimension for generic models. The same situation happens in the Hamkins' Well-foundedness Mirage Principle stating that "Every universe $V$ is non-well-founded from the perspective of another universe" and so there is no standard model of $\sf ZFC$. 

The social motivation, however, comes from occasional general claims by some mathematicians about how the mathematical society was, is or will be. Statements such as the followings: 

Historically, the current "standard" set of chess pieces wasn't the only existing alternative or even the standard one. For instance, the famous Al-Suli's Diamond Problem (which remained open for more than one millennium before getting solved by Grandmaster Yuri Averbakh) was formulated in an ancient Persian variant of chess, called Shatranj, using a fairy chess piece, called Wazir (Persian: counsellor), rather than the conventional queen. There is a long-standing discussion amongst chess players concerning the best possible configuration of chess pieces which makes the game more exciting and complicated. Also, one might be interested in knowing whether, in a fixed position on the infinitary chessboard, the game value could be changed into an arbitrary ordinal merely by replacing the pieces with new (possibly unconventional) ones rather than changing their positions. In order to address such questions one first needs to have a reasonable mathematical definition of the notion of a "chess piece" in hand. Maybe a promising approach inspired by Rook, Knight, and King's graphs is to simply consider a chess piece a graph which satisfies certain properties. Though, due to the different nature of all "reasonable" chess pieces, it seems a little bit hard to find principles which unify all of them into one single "neat" definition. For example, some pieces can move only in one direction, some others can jump out of the barriers, some have a/an finite/infinite range, some can only move among positions of a certain color, etc. Here the following question arises:
