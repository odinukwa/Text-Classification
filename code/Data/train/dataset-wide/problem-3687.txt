You are in very difficult situation, I agree - "been there, down that", and the end was not pretty. Depending on the structure of the firm you work for, sometimes turning directly to HR can help - that is one of things they are there for: To provide a venue for employees to register complaints and express grievances about abusive workplace situations and potential violations of company policy. Far too often, however, that isn't much of a remedy: HR will be very pleasant and accommodating, pay "lip service" to your complaint, and then file it away and forget about it as soon as you leave the room... If you run into the same sort of disingenuous/evasive behavior at HR as you did with those directly above you in the chain of command, then you're working at a bad firm - try to expedite your exit, as per my conclusion, and @Leigh's answer. Another way of working things, depending on your friends and connections in the firm (as well as its structure) is to skip a level or two - try turning to the manager's manager or someone else "higher up" who knows you and values and respects you and your work as an employee. I have done that a few times, and it worked - for a while... But it's risky - you need to be good at office politics to get it right. Bottom line is that unfortunately, I have to agree with @Leigh's conclusion: Be diligent in your documentation (you seem to be on the right track in that respect) and quietly prepare for an exit - your situation may be approaching toxicity. 

I'm not aware of a legal requirement to give two weeks notice anywhere, unless you signed a contract to that end. Over my 26 years in IT (Helpdesk, Application Developer, now DBA), I've experienced my fair share of bad fits. There have been times when I wanted to walk out the door without so much as a by your leave, but I never did. That said, if it were a sufficiently bad fit, and if I had something better in hand, I might well consider it. If you can at all give two weeks notice, then do so. If you have already established a start date with the new company, then this may not be possible (e.g. you said you'd start on December 28). Any time there is rapid turnover or a short stint on a resume, yes it will sometimes raise red flags to a future potential employer. They don't want you to walk out the door on them. With that said, I've left places on good terms knowing that I would never be welcomed back there because of a corporate culture of loyalty where you're with us or against us and if you leave then you are dead to us. There is no pleasing some people, even if you are there for a short time and you do good work for them. A lot of my experience gained over the years likely would not have been possible had I not been assertive in my pursuit of opportunities. This assertiveness has led to me work for 14 different places in 26 years, and yes at times they've asked me whether I was a job hopper. Most of the time, when asked in interviews, I was able to make an effective case that either I wasn't being challenged with the work, the organization didn't have a real future, that it was a short term contract I knew about going in, or something similar. If the situation is as bad as you say--and unlike the rest of us you're there on the ground so you'll know best--then you should leave and take the job offer with the new employer, regardless of whether you are able to give two weeks notice to your current employer. In terms of what you should say in the future, or even when telling your current employer that you are leaving, always remember that the glass is always half full, at least. Even in the darkest of times, present things in a positive light. When you are asked a question, any question, the person asking you the question generally does not want you to give a full and complete answer. A question such as, "Why did you leave Company X after working there for only a few weeks?" might take 10 minutes to give a full and complete answer and the answer has five components--three of which are considered positive, one is considered neutral, and one is considered negative. If asked that question, start with one of the positive components and segue into another of the positive components, then stop talking. You will have answered for 30 seconds to a minute, answered with a positive answer, and because you stopped talking they will assume you have answered the question. 

Perhaps explain that you are experiencing financial hardship, and since you are doing the work of an analyst and working on the degree, maybe they can make an exception and pay you as an analyst for a stipulated period of time - for example until you can negotiate your financial difficulties (six months or a years, etc) or a reasonable amount of time for you to finish your degree and acquire the official title, so you can be duly compensated without a special exception. Do not ask for a "blanket exception", one that relinquishes you from all responsibility - IMO that doesn't smell right. Also make sure that you are indeed doing the work that demands higher pay, and that you aren't dealing with a perception problem: Doing more than you think you are. You can probably verify this by talking to co-workers, etc. 

IMO yes, you should do exactly that. I think that more often than not, this sort of question isn't really designed to discover your weakness in terms of your potential job duties, but to assess your honesty about yourself and your shortcomings. This is particularly true if it's an HR interview, as opposed to a technical interview etc - i.e. an interview to assess your actual skill-set. I have met with this question in interviews, and I generally answered quite honestly and concisely, which seemed to make a good impression, although sometimes the interviewer was a bit taken aback by my ability to be so forthcoming. The inevitable follow up question will be: "So, how do you see that affecting your job here and what are you doing to overcome that weakness?". At that point, again, lay it out clearly - don't try to finesse and bs around - just make sure that you do have some good, clear, honest answers for those questions. Such an approach will often leave an impression on potential employers that makes you stand out among other candidates who come up with standard answers. It is indeed somewhat risky, but IMO it is worth the risk, particularly with respect to technical positions: I have landed two or three good jobs because I impressed them as being a "straight shooter" - "this is not someone who is going to 'yank our chain' ". 

In large part, this is going to depend upon the rules in your office and the laws in your area. In the United States, the Family Medical Leave Act, or FMLA, could potentially be in play here. In the State of Washington, the Washington Family Care Act imposes additional rules when it comes to sick leave. Unless you are say going to be out for an extended period of time, because of either a planned or unplanned major medical issue, it's generally accepted most places to call in each and every day you are out sick. If it were me, I would have called in sick each and every day that I was out sick. The means of notification will also vary from one organization and supervisor to the next. Some will insist upon a live human being speaking to another live human being over the phone. Others are fine with voice mail or Email notifications. Increasingly, I see Email notifications as superior as I routinely see instances of people calling in sick, getting voice mail, and the person who gets the voice mail is themselves out of the office--either for sick or other purposes. I personally send an Email to the Team Email Distribution List, which includes both my supervisor and my coworkers. In my view, this provides for the greatest possibility of someone who needs to get hold of me getting the message that I won't be in the office that day. As for what to say, as a Union Shop Steward I tell people to be brief and not go into details. This is especially true with FMLA, but it is serves everyone best if the information is brief. "I am out sick today." "My child is sick today." "My elderly parent is sick today." 

As you certainly realize, they probably want your Dad out of there. A new young boss comes in and wants to make things their own, so "out with the old, in with the new". Is it smart, nice, polite or appropriate? No. But like they say in the gangster movies, "It's not personal - it's just business". There usually isn't much you can do about it unless a new and more appropriate role can be found for someone like your dad. That may or may not be a viable option in your case. 

I like you last idea: Mention the projects you did and their scope, to show that you have hands-on experience doing real stuff, (you can/should mention that they were done in the school context) but writing up "I took a course in Advanced Data Structures", etc does IMO sound strange. 

Explain in your resume the specific problems you encountered when working on that site and how you addressed them and improved the site thereby. Just focus on what you did to make things better - if you go into details and specifics about that, it will look good. It is unlikely that your own accomplishments would be diminished simply because there are other problems on the site that you were not able to address, or not given the opportunity to do so. 

Most organizations have policies that may, I stress may, apply here. First, when you say "offensive comments", do you mean profanity or threats? If they are using profanity in the workplace, Management and HR might be interested and want to put a stop to that. Now, with that said, every office is different, and if a person let's a few profane words slip out now and again, it might not be enough to warrant any sort of intervention. You should really consider what are the normative behaviors. In other words, is what these people say within the norms of your workplace? If yes, then move along on this point. Threats can be analogous to profanity in that they are something no one wants to hear, but in the course of day to day language they are much more acceptable than even profanity. "I could kill my dry cleaner. He ruined another suit." "This idiot driving in the slow lane today should be shot, and I'm willing to do it." "For all the money my wife spends on clothes, I should divorce her. No kill her first, then divorce her." People have these sorts of outbursts that can be very commonplace. Once again, if what the people in question are saying fits within workplace norms, move along. A second line of thought is whether the offensive comments are creating an undue workplace interruption for you. If so, then both Management and HR are more likely to take an interest because that impacts the bottomline if the work isn't getting done. As with profanity and threats, you must consider whether the behavior fits within workplace norms. Do they talk about their rotten kids for a few minutes at a time a few days out of the month at their workspace? Do they talk about their rotten kids for two to four hours at a time each and every day at their workspace? In between these two extremes lies the reality. If it's closer to the former, move along. If it's closer to the latter, then you definitely need to raise it up to Management and HR under the context of workplace interruption. 

If I understand this question correctly, you are asking for a raise even though you don't deserve it, because you claim later on you will deserve it. Things don't work that way in the business world: You get paid for what you do and what you have proved, not for what you didn't do or hope to do. At the risk of sounding cruel, buckle up and stop taking off from work when you feel depressed - that will do a great deal to help your depression, and also get you your raise: "Biological Depression" may be a result, not a cause - there is evidence to support that idea. Regardless, using "biological depression" as an excuse for one's deficiencies is in no way productive. Everyone has difficulties, some far worse than yours and more difficult to overcome, from terrible allergies to congenital blindness to dyslexia, and everything in between: Successful people learn how to adjust and prevail over their deficiencies - the examples are endless. Unfortunately, therapists, like almost every other professional we deal with in our lives, are there to make money, not necessarily to help you with all the appropriate advice. 

No need to "apologize". IMO that is decidedly unprofessional, unless your client explicitly pushes you up against the wall about it. If that does comes to pass, don't try to squirm out of it, just apologize that you're still a beginner and tried your best, but you're not yet seasoned in making accurate time estimates. Don't get into long explanations and excuses. Be short, to the point, and professional. Offering "extras" as compensation for the delay might not be such a good idea, as others have mentioned: That tends to cheapen you and makes you appear a bit desperate (never a good thing), puts focus on your lack of experience, and leaves you vulnerable to endless requests for "freebees", etc. But what's done is done. Avoid that in the future. You didn't charge based on time, you were up front and honest with them from the beginning, and priced the work based on your experience. So, I think you are off to a good start. As long as you delivered a solid working product, I don't think you need be too concerned. The client may seem impatient, but if you did a good job they will soon be appeased when they enjoy the fruits of your labor. For the future: Until you get really good at estimating your delivery times (that takes quite a while, and often even experts make mistakes on that) triple or quadruple (at least...) the number that first seems viable to you. 

First, consider what you want to do. Then go talk to your ex-boss one on one and face to face, and be honest with him. Don't think of it so much as loyalty as it is maintaining, fostering, and growing a business relationship. This person thought enough of you that he found you a job before shutting down the company. This tells me that he sees something of value in you. He has the potential to be of value to you, so don't throw that away. Start the conversation with something like this. 

When faced with a foolish statement, I often prefer quips and sound bites to well reasoned arguments as most people are neither prepared nor interested in a well reasoned argument when they make a foolish statement. Here are a few to try. "Those who can do. Those who can't teach. Those who can do neither study." "So basically you're out of ideas and pounding the table?" "Well, if that's what they do at then perhaps you should return to ." Throw out a fictional institute of higher learning. Google for names. "You would never have made it at Faber College." Faber College was in "Animal House". If you want a quip that is rooted in a well reasoned argument try, "Argumentum ad verecundiam". It means "Argument from authority", and it is one of many logical fallacies. $URL$ 

By doing so, you take control of the situation immediately, and that is important: A recruiter is not working for you, no matter how interested and sincere they sound. They are working for themselves and their employers, or the people looking to hire. So you shouldn't let them lead you around. When you ask 'is it in location X', as others have suggested, you are opening the door for the recruiter to yank your chain by pulling a bait and swap or lying and telling you it's in the place you want in order to get you interested, then twist things around with something like 'Oh - I meant their main office is in London, but this particular job is Antarctica... Yes, the winters are tough, but what a benefits package they're offering!' (No, recruiters not above such ploys.) If the recruiter gets testy or becomes a pest because of your question, I echo @johnk 's answer: Also, don't worry about being polite to recruiters. It's a hustle, a numbers game. Just hang up if someone is wasting your time. 

Hard to say how you can prove the intention. But I'm old school: Since you say it's not difficult for you to get to work, then you most certainly should, especially when first starting out, and being the lead developer. You need to be where the action is taking place if you want to establish your position, authority and credibility. You need to learn face-to-face about the people you are working for and with. There is nothing that can replace personal interaction for that. Right now, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by going in to work every day. Remember: No matter how much you work and interact on-line, as soon as you go off-line you are out of the loop - clueless. You might as well be on Mars. That's never good for anybody, particularly a team leader. (I'm speaking from bitter experience...) You could get on video conference and give what you think is a great motivational speech about team interaction, but miss out on entirely on all the eye rolling and laughing that takes place after you log off... (Sure, that can happen when you're there as well, but it will be much easier for you to pick up on it or hear about it when you're on site.) Once things are established and your position is solidified, perhaps you can consider working from home, at least part of the time. But by then you may realize how important it is for you to be on-site every day. 

The key issue to address is whether your employer is aware of and OK with the fact that you will live at the workplace. While the idea of living at work may sound odd, there are circumstances where this is perfectly normal (e.g. Park and Forest Rangers, Caretakers). If your employer is willing to let you live at your workplace, then they should have no problem giving you something on letterhead that you will reside at to satisfy California DMV. $URL$ A cell phone bill is listed as one of the approved documents, and I've never had a cell phone company challenge me to provide them with proof of residency. They simply accept whatever I give them. 

What you say next depends upon what you want to do. Do you want to continue doing the freelance work, but perhaps at a different pace or fewer hours spent on the work each week? Do you want to abandon the freelance work altogether, which has the potential of eliminating any future freelance work. One of the unknowns, or at least not stated in your post, is how long do you expect the freelance work to continue. A few more weeks, a few more months, a few more years, something else. If you don't know, ask. Maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel, and the work he needs you to do will be ending soon.
