I have a very naive question. Recall that over the field of complex numbers, there exist non-algebraic K3 surfaces. Namely, smooth non-projective simply connected compact complex surfaces with trivial canonical bundle. Such surfaces often come in useful when studying the moduli and deformations of K3 surfaces over $\mathbb{C}$. 

Perhaps this is dealt with in the original article where Debarre and de Jong made this conjecture, however I have been unable to find it, only other papers (not by Debarre and de Jong) which state this conjecture (without reference). 

i.e. if $b$ is killed by some field extension $L$, then must $b$ be killed by some finite field extension of $k$ which is contained in $L$? 

Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{Q}_p$. Then by definition $G$ admits no non-trivial algebraic characters, i.e. homomorphisms $G \to \mathbb{G}_m$. However, it is quite possible that $G(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ admits topological characters. E.g. take $G=\mathrm{PGL}_n$ and consider the composition $$\mathrm{PGL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p) \to \mathbb{Q}_p^*/\mathbb{Q}_p^{*n} \to S^1, \quad g \mapsto \chi(\det(g)),$$ where $\chi: \mathbb{Q}_p^*/\mathbb{Q}_p^{*n} \to S^1$ is some character. In this special case $G$ is adjoint, however. I can also do similar constructions for other adjoint groups. So I'm wondering whether this can also happen for simply connected $G$. 

The "degree" of a line bundle is not defined in general, it is better to study $\textrm{Pic}^0$, the connected component of the indentity of the Picard scheme. For abelian varieties this is exactly the dual abelian variety. As noted in the comments, the Picard group of a linear algebraic group $G$ is finite, so $\textrm{Pic}^0(G)=0$ and hence it is not very interesting. By Chevalley's theorem, we may write any algebraic group $H$ as $$0 \to G \to H \to A \to 0,$$ where $G$ is linear algebraic and $A$ is abelian. I claim that $\textrm{Pic}^0(H) = \textrm{Pic}^0(A) = \widehat{A}$, so one can reduce to the case of abelian varieties. Here is a sketch of a proof. By [1, Prop. 6.10], we have an exact sequence $$0 \to \textrm{Pic}(A) \to \textrm{Pic}(H) \to \textrm{Pic}(G).$$ As already noted, $\textrm{Pic}(G)$ is finite. Hence when we restrict this exact sequence, to the identity component, we obtain $\textrm{Pic}^0(H) = \textrm{Pic}^0(A)$, as required.

As I say above, I am well aware that this question is very naive. Possible guesses I had in mind were formal schemes / stacks / rigid analytic spaces / ...? 

The Honda-Tate theorem says that there exists some abelian variety $A$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ such that $P(t)$ occurs in the zeta function of $A$, coming from the part corresponding to $H^1(A,\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$. Moreover $A$ is determined up to isogeny by $P(t)$. However $$H^1(C,\mathbb{Q}_\ell) \cong H^1(J(C),\mathbb{Q}_\ell)$$ where $J(C)$ denotes the Jacobian of $C$. A simple counting argument shows that not every abelian variety is isogenous to the Jacobian of some curve, which implies that the answer to your question is no. 

Let $k$ be a field and $G$ a connected semisimple algebraic group over $k$. If $k$ is algebraically closed, then it is well known that all Borel subgroups of $G$ are conjugate by the action of $G(k)$. I would like to know whether this is also true over non-closed fields. 

Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and let $$E: y^2 = f(x)$$ be an elliptic curve over $k$, with $\mathrm{deg}(f) = 3$. Kummer theory yields a map $$\varphi:\mathrm{H}^1(k, E[2]) \to \mathrm{H}^1(k, E)[2].$$ In particular, to each element $c \in \mathrm{H}^1(k, E[2])$ we may associate a principal homogeneous space for $E$. 

I need a version of this result in a paper I am currently writing. We are able to use this to show that the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(X)$ on $H^n(X,\mathbb{C})$ is faithful for any such smooth complete intersection (not necessarily generic). I would be most interested if anyone has any ideas on alternative approaches to this problem as well. We are able to handle many special cases, such as when the degrees $d_i$ are all different or $X$ is of general type. A critical case is for example when all the degrees are the same and $X$ is Fano of high codimension. 

This problem is of a more arithmetic nature, than geometric. For example, since every automorphism of $\mathbb{C}$ preserves $\mathbb{Q}$, we see that if $X$ can be defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, then $\Omega_X$ consists of a single isomorphism class. Similarly if $X$ can be defined over a number field, then $\Omega_X$ consists of only finitely isomorphism classes. Thus the size of $\Omega_X$ is telling you something about the size of the smallest field of definition of $X$, not really anything about the geometry of $X$. On the other hand given any two algebraically independent transcendental numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$, there is an automorphism of $\mathbb{C}$ which swaps $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and moreover there are uncountably many such numbers. Therefore, my guess is that $\Omega_X$ consists of countably many isomorphism classes, iff $\Omega_X$ consists of finitely many isomorphism classes, iff $X$ may be defined over a number field. 

Let $X$ be smooth variety defined over $\mathbb{Q}$. If we want to check that $X$ is locally soluble at a prime $p$, then it suffices to find a non-singular $\mathbb{F}_p$ point, which can be lifted to a $\mathbb{Q}_p$ point by Hensel's lemma. However, it might happen that $X$ does not have any non-singular $\mathbb{F}_p$ points. For example $X$ could be given by a quadratic form and we are interested in the prime $p=2$, in which case the reduction mod $2$ of $X$ is a non-reduced scheme and hence every point is singular (at least if I understand the situation correctly). What general methods are there, if any, to check local solubility in this kind of situation? A nice toy example is the equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2=0$. This is locally soluble for all primes $p>=3$ (by Chevalley–Warning) and clearly not soluble for $p=\infty$, hence it is not soluble at $p=2$ (by the Hilbert symbol formulation of quadratic reciprocity). Is there a simple way to see this using general methods? 

The vector space $H^0(\mathbb{P}V,\mathcal{O}(1))$ can be identified with $V^{\vee}$. This is because elements of $H^0(\mathbb{P}V,\mathcal{O}(1))$ can be identified with linear functionals on $V$ (just think of the case where $V=\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, where $H^0(\mathbb{P}V,\mathcal{O}(1))$ is the collection of linear homogeneous polynomials on $\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$). The action of $\textrm{SL}(V)$ on $H^0(\mathbb{P}V,\mathcal{O}(1))$ is just the natural action on $V^{\vee}$. More generally, the linearization on $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gives a linearization on $\mathcal{O}(d)$ for any $d$. We may identify $H^0(\mathbb{P}V,\mathcal{O}(d))$ with the symmetric power $S^d(V^{\vee})$ together with its natural action of $\textrm{SL}(V)$. 

Recall that a Brauer-Severi variety over $k$ is a non-singular projective variety over $k$ which becomes isomorphic to some projective space over $\bar k$. 

By the way your question is phrased, it seems that you might be familiar with the following construction. But anyway, any toric variety can be realised as the quotient of $\mathbb{A}^n \setminus A$ by the action of an algebraic torus (for some $n$ and $A$). This is proved in the famous paper of Cox: The Homogeneous Coordinate Ring of a Toric Variety. This theory has been generalised much by the theory of Cox rings and universal torsors. This says that any "suitably nice" variety $X$ (namely, a Mori dream space) is a quotient of $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathrm{Cox}(X)) \setminus A$ (for some $A$) by the action of the Néron-Severi torus of $X$. Moreover, $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathrm{Cox}(X))$ is isomorphic to an affine space if and only if $X$ is a toric variety. 

Let $X$ be a smooth cubic threefold over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $L \subset X$ be a line. The projection from $L$ yields a rational map $X \dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^2$. Resolving the indeterminacy by blowing up $L$, we obtain a conic bundle morphism $\pi: \tilde{X} \to \mathbb{P}^2$. Consider the relative anticanonical bundle $\omega_{\pi}^{-1}$. By standard properties of conic bundles we obtain an embedding $$\tilde{X} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E})$$ which respects $\pi$. Here $\mathcal{E} := \pi_*\omega_{\pi}^{-1}$ is a vector bundle of rank $3$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{E}) \to \mathbb{P}^2$ is the associated $\mathbb{P}^2$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^2$. 

Thanks to Dror for pointing out a nice geometrical way to think of such varieties. This paper shows that such varieties are not rational in general: $URL$ However, any algebraic torus over a number field $K$ of dimension one or two is rational over $K$. Indeed, the case of dimension one is easy, and the case of dimension two is a theorem of Voskresenskiĭ, but algebraic tori of dimension three and above do not have to be rational over the ground field in general. 

A complete list of non-rational Fano threefolds, together with results towards non-stable rationality, can be found in the paper: BRENDAN HASSETT AND YURI TSCHINKEL- ON STABLE RATIONALITY OF FANO THREEFOLDS AND DEL PEZZO FIBRATIONS $URL$ 

There is one useful fact that might by relevant to you. A line bundle $L$ and a complex projective variety $X$ is trivial if and only if $H^0(X,L) \neq 0$ and $H^0(X,L^{-1})\neq0$. Indeed one implication is clear, and for the other choose two non-zero elements $s \in H^0(X,L)$ and $s' \in H^0(X,L^{-1})$. Then $ss' \in H^0(X,\mathcal{O})$ is non-zero. Since $H^0(X,\mathcal{O}) = \mathbb{C}$, we see that in fact $ss'$ is nowhere vanishing. Thus $L$ admits a nowhere vanishing section, and so is trivial. Naturally a similar result holds for more general fields. 

Here by almost all, I mean all but finitely many. Here is an equivalent way to state this question in terms of number fields. 

Here is another way to see why this is true (though as already noted you need $s >3$). Note that if $X$ is a toric variety with respect to an algebraic torus $T$, then by definition $T$ acts faithfully on $X$. In particular there is an injective homomorphism $T \to \mathrm{Aut}(X)$. Now if $X$ the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in $s >3$ general points, then it is "well-known" that the automorphism group of $X$ is finite (see e.g. The main theorem of Koitabashi - Automorphism groups of generic rational surfaces). In particular such surfaces are not toric varieties. Moreover Koitabashi even shows that the automorphism group is trivial for $s \geq 9$. Note that this method also shows that such $X$ do not admit a faithful action of any algebraic group of positive dimension, so they are very far from being homogeneous. 

Here is a high-brow way to interpret your construction. Recall that the ideles $\mathbb{A}^\times$ of $\mathbb{Q}$ are defined to be the restricted direct product of $\mathbb{R}^\times$ and all $\mathbb{Q}_p^\times$ with respect to the subgroups $\mathbb{Z}_p^\times$. There is a natural "diagonal" embedding $\mathbb{Q}^\times \subset \mathbb{A}^\times$. Moreover, we can combine all $p$-adic valuations together to get a homomorphism $$\mathbb{A}^\times \to \bigoplus_p \mathbb{Z}.$$ Your "inner product" is then just given by the composition $$\mathbb{Q}^\times \times \mathbb{Q}^\times \subset \mathbb{A}^\times \times \mathbb{A}^\times \to \bigoplus_p \mathbb{Z} \times \bigoplus_p \mathbb{Z} \to \bigoplus_p \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z},$$ where the penultimate map is component wise multiplication and the last map is the obvious sum. How does this help? Well it illustrates how your construction can be put into the bigger picture of the more natural ideles, which are certainly a very important part of number theory. But I don't think your construction has "any significance, from the perspective of number theory". Number theorists tend to work with the more natural diagonal embedding $\mathbb{Q}^\times \subset \mathbb{A}^\times$ into the ideles, as the ideles have more structure (e.g. form a topological group) 

Let $\eta \to S$ be the generic point of $S$. The function field of $S$ is exactly the residue field of $\eta$. Let $k(S) \subset K$ be a field extension (no need to assume that $K$ is algebraically closed). The map $\mathrm{Spec}\, K \to S$ factors as $\mathrm{Spec}\, K \to\mathrm{Spec}\, k(S) \to S$. The image of $\mathrm{Spec}\, K \to S$ is thus just $\eta$. But now you apply a base-change to $K$ and $S \otimes K$ need no longer be irreducible. The image of $\mathrm{Spec}\, K \to S \otimes K$ is a point of $S \otimes K$ which lies above $\eta$; such a point is exactly a generic point of an irreducible component of $S \otimes K$. Different choices of embeddings $k(S) \subset K$ will give rise to different irreducible components, and all the irreducible components will arise this way. 

The fibre at infinity is "multiple", i.e. as divisors on $S$ one has $\pi^{-1}(\infty) = mD$ for some $m > 1$ and some divisor $D$. All other fibres are integral. 

I'm trying to understand better conic bundles on quartic del Pezzo surfaces over non-algebraically closed fields. Let $k$ be a field. A conic bundle surface is a smooth projective surface $S$ over $k$ equipped with a dominant morphism $S \to C$ to some smooth curve $C$, whose fibres are isomorphic to plane conics. Let $S$ be a quartic del Pezzo surface over $k$ (i.e. $S$ is a smooth complete intersection of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}^4$). If $S$ contains a conic $Q$ over $k$, then it admits a conic bundle. Namely, the pencil of hyperplanes through $Q$ gives rise to a conic bundle morphism $S \to \mathbb{P}^1$, determined by the conics residual to $Q$. I want to know whether every conic bundle on $S$ has this form. 

I appreciate that this question is slightly vague. What I am looking for is something like a geometrical characterisation of such surfaces, say in terms of certain geometric invariants (i.e. hodge numbers, chern classes,...?). If this is too naive to hope for, then perhaps they have distinguished moduli, for example by forming a connected component of the moduli of surfaces of general type. 

You need to be a bit careful, since, as I already point out, you should really view $GL_n$ itself as a unitary group. But you really want to ask whether $U_v$ can be isomorphic to a general linear group. As already explained in the comments, and following the classification, this happens iff $v$ is split in $E/F$.
