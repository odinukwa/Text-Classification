In teaching a second year UK course in analysis some years ago I was surprised to find out how pleasant were the proofs of the some of the basic results using sequential methods, for example that a continuous function on a closed bounded subset of $\mathbb R^n$ to $\mathbb R$ is bounded. This inspired me to work out a paper on the notion of a $1$-point sequential compactification: add another point and let the sequences in $X$ with no convergent subsequence converge to the extra point! It got published too in the JLMS. However for continuity of a function I do like to rely on the neighbourhood definition since a neighbourhood is a geometric object one can draw, whereas the $\epsilon - \delta$ are only measurements of the sizes of neighbourhoods. 

There is a discussion of some of these issues in articles on my web page on `Popularisation and Teaching' $URL$ and the 1989 article 'Making a mathematical exhibition' discusses the conclusions we came to after 4 years preparing an exhibition on `Mathematics and knots', which you can see as part of $URL$ The point was that we were using knots to say some things about mathematics to the general public; so you have to decide what it is you are trying to convey. The advantage of knots as a basis for discussion is that everyone can understand the basic ideas and problems. As I popular and important book which I think has not been mentioned on MO as an example of good writing, here is The Nothing That is: A Natural History of Zero Robert Kaplan (Author), Ellen Kaplan (Introduction) (1999). Grothendieck wrote to me in 1982: "The introduction of the cipher 0 or the group concept was general nonsense too, and mathematics was more or less stagnating for thousands of years because nobody was around to take such childish steps ..." (I had mentioned the resistance to the idea of groupoid.) The story is interesting partly because of the resistance to the idea of nothing, which was associated in some minds with the devil, and chaos, and also in the way that a conceptual change had such profound results. One reason for these results was that it led to a notation which better reflected the operations one wanted to do on numbers, particularly multiplication, and the ability to calculate insurance better led, it might be thought, to the prosperity of Venice. All from counting the number of elements in an empty box! But more likely, from the mark of a thumb in sand as a place maker on an abacus, so associated with calculation. So part of the story of maths is that of conceptual revolutions, which enabled difficult things to become easy, which of course then enables the practice of more difficult things, and that is one of the roles of mathematics. Many people want to hear of such conceptual revolutions, rather than of the solution of some problem famous for its difficulty, and perhaps also for the difficulty of understanding its significance for the general world. My own take on the importance of mathematics is that it develops rigorous languages for expression, description, deduction, verification, and calculation. There is also the notion of mathematical structure as a method of modelling the real world. 

This may not be a helpful answer to the precise question, but in the 1970s I got disillusioned with homology as a first course in algebraic topology and started teaching knot theory; the examples are immediate, and one gets links with group theory, and with some homological type ideas, via the free differential calculus. Students could quickly see what the subject was about, and it showed that you were getting some answers but incomplete ones. Also there are lots of nice computational examples to do. It also fits with my view developed over the years that algebraic topology should be and can be more nonabelian, to reflect the geometry. For example, one would really like to write the boundary of the standard diagram of the Klein Bottle as $a+b-a+b$, not just $2b$. This knotty activity led to me giving general lectures on "How mathematics gets into knots", and into all sorts of things, including making a mathematical exhibition and promoting the work of the sculptor John Robinson. Others took over the course and even got a nice book out of it ("Knots and surfaces" by Gilbert and Porter). 

Since you are interested in chain complexes related to those in the Eilenberg-Zilber Theorem you could look at Homological Perturbation Theory, once one of your surmersions is converted to a fibration. 

Here are some suggestions on this matter. In this area one should be aware that there are equivalences of categories (crossed modules of groupoids) $\sim$ ($2$-groupoids) $\sim$ (double groupoids with connections) and one has to consider in which of these one should try to formulate results. In the paper "Modelling and computing homotopy types: I" the distinction is made between "Narrow" and "Broad" algebraic models, and their uses, and for this comparison $2$-groupoids are between the two. In this paper we (Mackenzie and RB) define actions of a double groupoid on a groupoid, and this seems easily extendable to actions of an $n$-fold groupoid on an $(n-1)$-fold groupoid. The book Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAT) defines cubical $\omega$-groupoids, and it also gives a cubical Dold-Kan theorem. So from chain complexes of vector spaces over $\mathbb K$ one gets a category $\omega$-$\mathsf{Vect}_{\mathbb K}$; so one can start to consider "representations". There is evidence that such discussions in a globular setting, i.e. in terms of $n$-categories, would be more awkward. Certainly I have found them so. That is why the book NAT strongly uses cubical methods. These ideas are not well worked out, but I hope give some possibilities. 

I have just now looked again at this interesting blog and thought to add a few points. 1) Methodology: You could read the comments of Grothendieck on "speculation" $URL$ I also think that in private one should test an idea `beyond the bounds of human thought': that is, just for fun, take it as far as you you think it can possibly go, and if all went as well as possible. This I call the "ideal scenario". If, under the ideal scenario, the result does not look all that exciting, then you might put is aside. On the other hand, if, under the ideal scenario, the result would be wonderful, then you might say to yourself: "Life is not like that, there must be some obstructions to this working." So you look for obstructions, small things that you think you might be able to do. If these obstructions turn to be real, then that would be interesting, and you should modify your scenario. On the other hand, if these obstructions disappear one by one, that would be even more interesting! Either way, this is a win-win research strategy. If some negative person (these abound in mathematics!) says "your idea cannot work because...." then that gives another obstruction to work on. I also like the idea of writing a (draft!) paper on your new idea, in which a key part is the Introduction, which should be as free ranging as possible, following flights of fancy, catching ideas as they occur. These can always be later relegated to another document (the great advantage of mathematical wordprocessing). The process of writing can make these ideas more real. So can talking about them, though you do sometimes get funny looks from superior people! You may write a draft 4 times, ending in failure, then the fifth time the paper writes itself! (It took me 9 years, and many drafts which ran into sand, trying to write a paper on a new homotopy double groupoid, before realising with Philip Higgins in 1974 that it was useful to try a definition for a pair of spaces, rather than a plain space!) 2) The composer Ravel said you should copy. If you have some originality, then this might come out as you copy. If not, then never mind! I feel copying is a way of getting the rusty wheels of the brain slowly turning! The originality may come out later. So I advise trying to write up a known piece of mathematics in as "nice" a way as you can. Nothing can be lost by this. 3) A question for Scott: Is there a (hopefully useful) groupoid version of quandles related to the fundamental groupoid and a `peripheral subgroupoid'? 4) A dictum of the algebraist Philip Hall was that one should try to make the algebra model the geometry rather than force the geometry into an already existing algebraic mold. For me, an example of this "forcing" is to try and get a group, and then bring in the idea of change of base point, when the naturally occurring structure is a groupoid. There are many other examples! 

I refer to the paper available here R. Brown, P.J. Higgins, S.A. Morris, ``Countable products of lines and circles: their closed subgroups, quotients and duality properties'', Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc. 78 (1975) 19-32. In this paper, we study the class $\mathcal D_{\Pi}$ consisting of all Hausdorff Abelian groups topologically isomorphic to a product of a compact group with a countable product of copies of $\mathbb R$ and $\mathbb Z$. In ยง4, we prove: THEOREM B. Closed subgroups and Hausdorff quotients of groups in $\mathcal D_{\Pi}$ are again in $\mathcal D_{\Pi}$. This paper also introduces the notion of strong duality for two topological abelian groups $A,B$, namely that not only are they dual in the usual sense, but this duality is inherited by closed subgroups and Hausdorff quotients. The theorem is that strong duality is inherited by closed subgroups and Hausdorff quotients. Later: I should point out that the purpose of this answer is to show that something can be said about generalising duality outside the category of locally compact abelian groups. This builds on earlier work of A. Kaplan. 

Thanks Andrew for the nice comments! In relation to the comment on G-spaces by Donu, I should point out that Chapter 11 of "Topology and groupoids" is on "Orbit spaces, orbit groupoids". But I doublt many topologists are aware of the latter concept! My new jointly authored book `Nonabelian algebraic topology: filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids' is published in August 2011 by the European Math. Soc and distributed in the Amercas by the AMS from October 2011. It is a kind of sequel to the above book, exploring some major uses of groupoids in higher homotopy theory. A kind of new foundation for algebraic topology at the border between homotopy and homology, and applications of some higher order Seifert-van Kampen Theorems. In particular, the 2-dimensional version allows some quite explicit calculations of homotopy 2-types. See my web site for more infomration. 

You might like to look at the article with Tim Porter "Making a mathematical exhibition" $URL$ As far as content goes we agreed that the exhibition should: 

This is a belated reply to this, but I had no time to look at mathoverflow while finishing the book on "Nonabelian algebraic topology:..." . First it should be emphasised that we get strict fundamental crossed complexes and $\infty$-groupoids (cubical or simplicial $T$-complex) for filtered spaces, not for a "bare" space. Indeed the fact that this strict theory works for filtered spaces, and so generalises the usual fundamental groupoid of a space with a set of base points, is part of the case for filtered spaces as a basic concept in algebraic topology. It will take time for this penny to drop! The simplicial nerve of a crossed complex gives the usual nerve if the crossed complex is simply a groupoid in dimension 1. The simplicial nerve of a crossed module is described in dimensions 1,2,3 on p. 323 of that book. See also the last part of section 3 of `Groupoids and crossed objects in algebraic topology', Homology, homotopy and applications, 1 (1999) 1-78. for a crossed module $\mu: M \to P$ the nerve $K$ is given by: $K_0 = {0}, K_1=P$. The 2-simplices of $K$ are quadruples $k=(m;p,q,r)$ such that $m \in M, p,q,r \in P$ and $\mu m = q p r^{-1} $ with $\partial _0 k=p, \partial _1 k=r, \partial _2 k=q$. The 3-simplices of $K$ are quadruples $(k_0,k_1,k_2,k_3)$ of 2-simplices such that if $k_i=(m_i;p_i,q_i,r_i), i=0,\ldots,3$, then \begin{equation} m_0^{p_3} m_2 m_1^{-1} m_3^{-1} =1, \end{equation}and the edges of the 2-simplices $k_i$ match up to form a 3-simplex. For $n\geqslant 4$, an $n$-simplex of $K$ is an $(n+1)$-tuple of $(n-1)$-simplices of $K$, whose faces match up appropriately. Actually in the reduced (one pointed) case this construction of the nerve of a crossed complex (but called a "group system") is essentially in Blakers, A. Some relations between homology and homotopy groups. Ann. of Math. (2) 49 (1948) 428--461. 

In the 1970s I developed an undergraduate course on knots, (source book was by Crowell and Fox) to replace general topology and homology, as it was very easy for students to understand the point of the course, there were interesting relations with group theory, and lots of specific calculations and other things to do. The course was eventually taken over by others, and resulted in a book, Knots and Surfaces, by N.D. Gilbert and T. Porter which had good reviews. For me, it led to giving popular talks on "How mathematics gets into Knots", and eventually to the exhibition you can see on the web site for the Centre for the Popularisation of Mathematics. In these talks I could also talk about mathematics, including, for example, the importance of analogy in mathematics. This led to one boy at a talk for children, some aged 12, asking: "Are there infinitely many prime knots? " Wow! So giving this undergraduate course has led to all sorts of fun and rewarding things! My copper pentoil knot used with string to demonstrate the ideas of the fundamental group has also travelled to many countries, see for example the pdf of a William J. Spencer Lecture in Kansas, April, 2012.
