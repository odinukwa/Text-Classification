There's several reasons why we might want a space-based exoplanet telescope over a ground-based telescope (or array of telescopes). 

LL Orionis bow shock in Orion nebula. The star's atmosphere collides with the nebula flow. Hubble, 1995 

The answer to this depends slightly on what is meant by "peculiar velocity". In the most general sense, the peculiar velocity of some object is the velocity it has with respect to some standard of rest. In the cosmological sense, the peculiar velocity of a galaxy in a cluster is simply any motion that galaxy may have which is not attributable to the Hubble flow. Primarily this peculiar velocity is a result of that galaxy's orbit around the cluster barycenter. With that in mind, it should hopefully be easy to reason out that clusters themselves will have peculiar velocities. It is highly unlikely that a cluster will be "fixed" in space and only move according to the Hubble flow. A quick google search revealed Bahcall & Oh 1996 which cites an rms one-dimensional galaxy cluster peculiar velocity of $298\pm28\:\mathrm{km/s}$ (based on 22 clusters). While this is smaller than a typical galaxy's peculiar velocity, it is certainly measurable and capable of being distinguished from the Hubble flow (at least for reasonable redshifts). The real difficulty here is not whether the cluster has a non-negligible peculiar velocity, but rather, is that peculiar velocity even measurable due to many of the potential limitations. While the value of the peculiar velocity of a cluster is certainly "high enough to be taken into account" it can often be difficult to measure such a velocity with any reasonable error (a point that Bahcill and Oh discuss). 

Before I start, let me just say that this topic is vastly more complicated than you've presented and what I will be showing. The trouble here is that ultimately, everything you've done and I will do (to a lesser extent) uses approximations and assumptions. Because of this, it can sometimes be hard to understand the true underlying physics when looking at only the "simple" versions of these equations. You say that the you've heard that the source of the two is because of receiving the signal and reflecting it, which is entirely true. Let's consider the simpler case of a police officer using radar to track a car's speed (just so we don't have to drag in the more complicated concepts of orbital motions of satellites, dispersion relations, etc.) You have a police officer standing by the side of the road with a radar gun, shooting radar waves of some frequency $f_o$ at the car as it recedes from him (note I'm going to use frequency but it is completely analogous to wavelength, assuming a simple dispersion relation). That wave travels to the car and the first peak of the wave hits the car. The car then has time to move slightly forward by the time the next peak hits the car. From the car's perspective, because of his relative motion to the police officer, the frequency of the wave hitting the car has been Doppler shifted to a new frequency, $f_1$. This new frequency is given by the Doppler equation $$\frac{f_1}{f_o} = \left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right)$$ Note that this equation is the same as what you presented, except that it uses frequency instead of wavlength. So now, our car has been hit by these frequency shifted waves. It will now reflect those waves back at the police officer. The process of reflection effectively makes the car an emitter of the frequency $f_1$ but since it's obviously moving with respect to the police office, the police officer receives a Doppler shifted frequency, which I'll call $f_2$. Since the speed between the car and the police officer is still $v$, we know that the Doppler equation for the frequency shift of the reflection is given by $$\frac{f_2}{f_1} = \left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right)$$ Now the police officer receives back a frequency $f_2$, but he originally emitted $f_o$, so he wants to know the velocity which caused the shift from $f_o$ to $f_2$. Fortunately, this can be determined by combining the two shifts above. $$\frac{f_2}{f_o} = \frac{f_2}{f_1}\frac{f_1}{f_o} = \left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right)\left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right)$$ $$\frac{f_2}{f_o} = \left(1+\frac{v}{c}\right)^2 = 1 + 2\frac{v}{c} + \frac{v^2}{c^2}$$ At this stage, we make the assumption that $v^2/c^2 \ll v/c$ and this second order term can be safely ignored. We then wind up with $$\frac{f_2-f_o}{f_o} = \frac{\Delta f}{f_o} = \frac{2v}{c}$$ What the police officer measures by using the radar gun and applying the Doppler equation is $2v$, but of course we know this to be twice the speed of the car, so of course to get the actual speed of the car, the speed measured by the radar gun must be divided by two. As you can hopefully see, this 2 comes from the double receive and reflect of the radio waves by the car. The same exact principle holds whether we're talking about radar guns and cars or satellites and planets. 

By definition, it is zero; the ecliptic is the plane of earth's orbit (or rather, the inverse: the path the Sun seems to follow along the sky). But you're probably looking for variations in the axial tilt of the Earth. There's a lot of formulas in the article, and on the (astronomically speaking) short timescale of a few million years, it oscillates between 22 and 24.5 degrees with a period of about 41,000 years. See the graph below, the red dot is the year 2000: 

Well, this radiation is way too small to be detected by itself, even if the black hole would be at our doorstep. However, the radiation makes the black hole less massive and smaller and finally it will vanish, producing a gamma ray flash which we hope is detectable, even from a very large distance. As @JamesK notes in the comments, this evaporation will take extremely long for the 'common' black holes caused by supernovae and those found in galaxy centers, but smaller primordial black holes, formed in the very beginning of the universe, could be evaporating now and that's why we have a telescope looking for those gamma ray flashes. 

Is it moving straight to the west (i.e. it keeps the same distance from the horizon) or does it 'move with the stars'? Have you checked an online planetarium like The Sky Live? Based on the current information, it could just be Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, or even Venus which is currently in her Evenstar period (but planets generally don't twinkle). 

As discussed here, the path of the Sun resembles a sine wave (see the image below), with a (semi-)amplitude equal to the axial tilt of the Earth, usually denoted $\varepsilon$, about 23.4 degrees. A simple formula, which might be accurate for your purposes, is the following: if $a$ denotes the right ascension (in hours), the declination $\delta$ is given by the following formula: $$\delta = \varepsilon \sin(2\pi\frac{a}{24h})$$ The actual formula is more complicated. From the formulas linked to by @barrycarter: $$\alpha = \arctan(\cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda)$$ $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \sin\lambda)$$ we obtain $$\tan\alpha = \cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda$$ $$\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon} = \tan\lambda$$ so $$\lambda = \arctan\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon}$$ Plugging this into the declination formula, and using the fact that $\sin(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{\pm\sqrt{x^2+1}}$, we get $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \frac{\tan\alpha}{\pm\sqrt{\tan^2\alpha+\cos^2\varepsilon}})$$ (here the right ascension $\alpha$ is measured in radians or degrees, not hours). 

I want to start with a disclaimer that I'm not a chemist and hopefully I don't screw any of the chemistry up. If I do, please let me know. I think Bill Oertell hit the nail on the head. Just because you can imagine a species which can drink lead doesn't mean it's actually physically possible. Only specific atoms can form the basis of the (extremely) complex organic molecules needed to form life and Carbon happens to be the atom which can do that. The primary reason for this is that Carbon has four valence electrons and its outer shell can hold eight, allowing it to form strong and varied bonds that most other atoms just can't form. As such, Carbon is the most logical element to form the backbone of organic molecules. Other ___-based Lifeforms Moving down the periodic table, you can see that Silicon has the same properties (4 valence elections, 8 possible) and you might be inclined to think that you could form some sort of silicon based life. This topic has been widely considered, but you run into a number of problems that make Silicon-based life unfeasible. The primary reason is that Silicon is just much bigger and more massive than Carbon (having a nucleus with 28 nucleons compared to Carbon's 12). This makes it harder for Silicon to form the necessary bonds that Carbon can readily form and you're out of luck right form the get-go. Similar issues occur with other "Carbon group" elements, except they're even further exacerbated by even higher masses. There are many other "organic" configurations chemists have considered such as boron-based life or sulfur-based life but they all have some sort of problem that makes it hard for it to exist. Some are more possible than others, but Carbon-based life, as we know it, just seems to be the best solution. If you gave someone all the elements in the periodic table and said, make organic life, they'd probably come back with Carbon-based life because its the easiest. You don't have to overcome as many obstacles. Observations Aside from the impracticality of non-Carbon based life, you have to consider that everything we've seen in the universe, as far as organic chemistry goes, points to the fact that the Universe is filled with Carbon-based chemistry. Astronomers have been able to look out at comets, interstellar dust clouds, and all sorts of places and time after time, they see complex, Carbon-based, organic molecules. For example: 

The major axis is just the sum of the distance at perigee plus the distance at apogee. This is 400 km + 1500 km + the diameter (not radius) of the Earth, and the semi-major axis is half of that. However, the semi-minor axis is harder to determine. Therefore, why not use an alternative method to calculate the eccentricity? $$e = \frac{r_a-r_p}{r_a+r_p}$$ Here, the $r$'s are the distance to the center of the Earth, not the apside altitudes. Can you take it from here? 

Does Polaris have a trail in the sky timelapse? Yes. Every star has a trail, but it's smaller if it's closer to the pole. Polaris is close to the pole but it's still 45 (arc)minutes away. I don't think it's visible with the naked eye; no star trail is visible with the naked eye as you only see one 'instance' of the sky. What perhaps would work, and is more feasible for stars closer to the celestial equator, is trying to see the movement of a star compared to an object on Earth, e.g. a tree, a building or the horizon. The exposure times of the photos are different, as @J.Chomel notes in the comments. You can calculate the exposure time by looking at the arc length; in 23 hours and 56 minutes (a 'sidereal day'), a star will make a full circle. The trails on the last photo have an arc length of about 8 degrees, corresponding to about 30 minutes; the first two photos are more like 9 resp. 5 hours. Also, the zoom factor (of the lens) may play a role; if a photo is zoomed in more, Polaris' movement is more likely to be visible. I'm not sure if this plays a role in this photos, though. 

As @RobJeffries mentions, you can calculate the difference from the equations which define magnitude and flux. But this particular case is even covered in the Wikipedia article on apparent magnitude: 

I'm very sorry for you, but this is just (mathematical) probability at work and no (astronomical) pattern. I'm on mobile right now so I can't do a full analysis, but note that if you divide Mercury's period (3520.2) by 89 instead of 88, the result is 39.55. Still pretty close to 39.88. In other words, the larger the numbers get, the easier is to find a 'divisor' close to 39.88.
