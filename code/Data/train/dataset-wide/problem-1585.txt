It is difficult to see how. Most comets and asteroids would encounter the Earth on a crossing orbit and the encounter velocity would be roughly the vector sum of the Earth's velocity around the Sun (of order 30 km/s) and the individual velocity of the rogue object. Even if you were to arrange it so that the asteroid/comet was diverted by something else so that it "caught up" with the Earth from behind travelling at an initially low relative velocity, there is the additional influence of the Earth's own gravitational potential. This would accelerate the approaching object to something like the order of the escape velocity from the Earth's surface - about 11 km/s. This fairly authoritative site on calculating the effect of asteroid/comet impacts suggests a minimum impact velocity of 11 km/s, which is indeed the Earth's escape velocity. Edit: (And credit to Keith Thompson for pointing it out). These are the speeds at the top of the atmosphere. If the objects are smaller than 20-30m, then the atmosphere will basically take out most of that kinetic energy, so for * small * objects, a relatively slow impact is de riguer. But for anything larger than $\sim$50 m, it is basically the full 11 km/s or more. $URL$ 

An object with a spectral type of M8 or cooler with Li is a substellar brown dwarf. An object with Li but a warmer spectral type may be a brown dwarf if it is old enough. An object younger than $\sim 150$ Myr without Li is a star. An object cooler than about spectral type L2 is a brown dwarf. 

The answer is yes. Early work showed that just over half of sun-like stars exhibit magnetic activity cycles similar to the Sun. These cycles can be monitored by looking at chromospheric activity, measured in the emission line cores of their Ca II H and K lines; by looking at spot modulation of their light curves; or for a few stars, looking at their coronal X-ray emission over time. Subsequent work has found cycles in most stars where there is good data (Olah et al. 2016). The cycles vary in length from star-to-star, where they have been found. Some stars show multiple cycle periods (e.g. Olah et al. 2009). There is obviously an observational bias towards finding shorter periods, but the Sun's cycle is towards the longer period end of what has been found. There seems to be a rough correlation between cycle period and rotational period - the cycle period is 100-300 times as long as the rotation period. An excellent short review is given by Korhonen (2015). 

Whether a white dwarf responds to the accretion of material by exploding or collapsing depends on the competition between energy being released in fusion reactions and energy being locked away by endothermic electron capture (neutronisation) reactions. It is thought that most white dwarfs of moderate mass have a C/O composition. They will need to accrete a lot of mass to get to a density (at about $4\times 10^{13}$ kg/m$^3$, reached at $1.38M_{\odot}$ in a non-rotating WD) where neutronisation becomes energetically feasible. It is possible, that before this happens, that fusion reactions are ignited (due to high density, rather than temperature). The threshold density for ignition is lower for nuclei with lower atomic number (He < C < O) and the ignition threshold densities for He and C are probably lower than the neutronisation threshold for C. In a C/O WD that has accreted a lot of matter, ignition could take place in C at the core, or it could be triggered in He (at even lower densities) at the base of a deep accreted shell of material. The electron degenerate matter has a pressure that is independent of temperature, leading to runaway fusion and the complete destruction of the star. O/Ne/Mg WDs are made as the final stages of more massive stars ($8-10M_{\odot}$) and are born as remnants with much higher mass $>1.2M_{\odot}$ than typical C/O WDs. More massive WDs are smaller, with higher density. The neutronisation thresholds for O, Ne, Mg are only $1.9\times10^{13}$, $6\times 10^{12}$ and $3\times 10^{12}$ kg/m$^3$ respectively (all lower than for C). This means that a O/Ne/Mg WD may have to accrete very little mass to reach this central density, begin neutronisation, which leads to collapse. In addition if such densities are insufficient to trigger C burning in a C/O WD, then they certainly won't be high enough to trigger burning in O/Ne/Mg because of stronger coulomb repulsion. Further, if little mass is accreted, then there won't be a deep envelope of accreted material in which to ignite burning off-centre. For all these reasons, O/Ne/Mg WDs may be more likely to collapse than explode (the collapse would cause a type of core-collapse supernova though). EDIT: Actually looking at the paper you reference (which is a bit dated), although some of the numbers have changed slightly, the semi-quantitative argument I give above is exactly how it is explained there. So I'm not sure whether my answer helps you. 

The 2 in your equation is the average number of mass units per electron. e.g. totally ionised carbon has 6 electrons and 12 mass units. In your formula, the mass of a proton is used as a mass unit (close enough in this case). In your second equation $n_e^{-1/3}$ is an approximation for the inter-particle separation. This is an approximation and there is a small numerical factor that would need to be introduced in an accurate treatment. 

It is a common point of confusion, but an infinite universe can still have been at a unique singularity in space-time at a finite time in the past. This singularity is not a "point in space", since every point in the universe participated in the big-bang. It is merely a time at which the scale factor, which multiplies the separation between all spatial points in the universe, was zero. So in cosmology governed by the Friedmann equation, the age of the universe thus calculated is the same whether you are talking about the "visible" universe or an infinite universe. The light travel time really doesn't come into this, because different parts of even a very large universe can be causally separated yet still have originated at the same singularity. 

Spectroscopic binaries are not necessarily close and not necessarily in circular orbits. If the orbit is circular, then a time series of radial velocity measurements for one or both stars would be well modelled with a simple sine wave. However, eclipsing binaries are almost certainly close, since eclipses in a system with widely separated components are improbable (but not impossible). If you have the eclipsing light curve, then the primary and secondary eclipses will be equi-spaced in time if the orbit is circular. The key factor for circularisation is the orbital period. If it is less than about 7 days (for solar-type stars), then circularisation due to tidal forces is almost certain. 

All discovered planets are in our Galaxy. The signature of a planet is too weak to be detected around the faint and unresolvable stars in even the nearest other galaxies. New telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will be capable of detecting transiting planets, and also microlensing events by planets, in the Magellanic clouds (e.g. see Mroz & Poleski 2017). The fraction of galactic mass that is tied up in exoplanets should be a tiny fraction of the total mass. If you add up the mass of all the planets in the solar system you end up with around 1% of a solar mass (mostly Jupiter). There is no indication that other stars have many more planets than the solar system, or that the mass of the solar system planets are at all unusual. The fraction of planets that end up not attached to stars is also likely to be quite small. Essentially some fraction of planets might be stripped away from their parents during the earliest phases of stellar evolution in a dense cluster (where the minority of stars are formed actually). So free-floating planets are unlikely to contribute much and indeed this has been confirmed by experiments a decade and more ago to detect "massive compact halo" objects in our own galaxy, which were unable to attribute much of the dark, baryonic matter to planets or the like. Finally, the dark matter problem is not just that there is matter that cannot be seen - it is that the majority of the matter in the universe is non-baryonic - that is, it is not made of the normal stuff that makes up stars and planets. So lots and lots of planets could not explain away most of the dark matter problem in any case. 

A column density is just the integral of a (number) density along the line of sight. Often, you would get the same observational absorption or emission signature from a number density of $n$ molecules cm$^{-3}$, spread along a line of sight through a cloud of diameter $x$, as you would with a density of $0.1n$ spread over $10x$. In other words, all we can infer is the product or, more accurately, the integral of $n\ dx$, and this is known as the column density. In the paper you refer to, I doubt they know the thickness of the shock they are investigating, so a column density is all that can be determined. The relative abundance is more straighforward; it is just the ratio of the number densities of the two labelled species. 

The answer is yes, there are many authors who do take mass loss from stars into account when trying to work out the fate of their planetary systems. Examples include Schroder & Smith 2008; Adams et al. (2013); Adams & Bloch (2013). It is thought that (e.g. Kalirai et al. 2008) that the Sun will lose half its mass by the time it ends up as a white dwarf. Almost all of this mass loss occurs in the final hundred million years or so (in just over 7.5 billion years time) whilst the Sun is on the red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch. The mass loss that occurs before then is small in comparison - about $10^{-13}$ of a solar mass every year (see Noerdlinger 2008), so losing less than 1% of its mass prior to the RGB. Consideration of conservation of angular momentum alone leads to the idea that $M(t)R$ is constant, where $M(t)$ is the mass of the Sun as a function of time and $R$ is the semi-major axis of a planetary orbit. Thus prior to the RGB phase, the Earth's orbit expands by maybe 1.4 cm per year, or by a total of $7\times 10^{-4}$ au prior to the RGB. However, during and after the RGB we see that the Earth ends up with an orbital radius of $\sim 1.5$ au (or in solar units, about 290 $R_{\odot}$) after the RGB and maybe 430 $R_{\odot}$ after the AGB. So, whilst the Sun is in the RGB/AGB phase and losing mass, the Earth moves outwards from about 215 to 430$ R_{\odot}$. Meanwhile, as it ascends the RGB, the Sun will likely increase in size to about $200 R_{\odot}$. Therefore it is a close-run thing as to whether the Earth will be engulfed within the outer envelope of the evolved Sun. Major uncertainties include just exactly how big the Sun will get, how much mass it will lose on the RGB and then on the AGB, and it turns out that the time-profile of the mass loss (which will happen in pulses, rather than continuously) may also play a role. The plot below (from Schroder & Smith 2008) may help to make some sense of this. It shows the (log) of the radius of the Sun versus time in the RGB and AGB phases as it loses mass. Also shown with a dashed line is the orbital radius of the Earth. Fractions written on the plot show what fraction of the Sun's present mass remains. 

The phenomenon of tidal locking occurs primarily in short period binary systems with convective envelopes. The tides raise bulges in the stars and these interact with convective motions to dissipate energy and to synchronise the orbital and rotational periods of stars and circularise their orbits. The process is much less efficient in stars with radiative envelopes. How can we tell observationally? Well, we have to show that the rotation period of a star is the same as its orbital period. The orbital period is easily found, either by measuring eclipses, in the case of binary systems with a high inclination, or by measuring the motions of the star(s) using the doppler shift in their spectra. Measuring rotation periods is also not so difficult. Fast-rotating stars with convective envelopes have magnetic activity and starspots (analogous to sunspots, but covering a larger area). As the star rotates then the light from the star goes up and down depending on what starspots are on the visible surface. This modulation gives the rotation period. In eclipsing binaries it can be difficult to separate out spots from eclipses, but here one can use the known orbital inclination and known radii of the stars to see whether their projected rotation velocities (measured from the widths of spectral absorption lines) matches the predictions from a tidally locked orbit. There are many known tidally locked bnaries. Any low-mass binary with an orbital period of less than a few days is almost certainly tidally locked, but the situation at orbital periods greater than about about 6-8 days becomes more complicated (e.g. Meibom et al. 2006). The plot below is taken from a review by Mazeh (2008), showing the rotation vs orbital periods from some small, but well-defined samples. The absolutely classic, must-read, theoretical work on this is by Zahn (1989). The timescale for synchronisation depends on structural properties of the stars, their moments of inertia, the binary mass ratio and the ratio of their separation to their radii to the power of 6. It is this latter property that means tidal locking is nearly bimodal; binaries with periods shorter than some threshold (about 6 days) are usually tidally locked, but those with slightly longer periods almost never are. 

We can't. That is an over simplification only used in elementary treatments simply to provide the the flavour of the argument. If you see it done somewhere in the refereed literature, it is probably incorrect. Of course it may be true that the mass is almost spherically symmetric, especially if it is dominated by a spherically symmetric dark matter component, but that the visible light is not. Or, it may be true that at large distances from even an asymmetric mass distribution, a Keplerian potential is a good approximation for the orbits of distant objects (e.g. satellite galaxies to the Milky Way). A measured galaxy rotation curve makes no such assumption, it is merely a measurement of rotation speed as a function of radius. It is only the interpretation and modelling that needs to deal with the mass distribution. The real situation is much more complex. See for example $URL$ However, even if one assumed all the mass was concentrated into a disk-like shape, the only way you can get flat rotation curves is to assume that the mass in the disk does not "follow the light" - that the mass-to-luminosity ratio increases vastly with radius - which is essentially still saying that you have "dark matter", just in a disk. 

No. The black hole at the centre of the Milky way is only a few million solar masses. The same amount of mass, made up mostly of stars, would be enclosed within $\sim 10$ parsecs of the Milky Way centre. The bulge of the Milky Way, which is a few thousand parsecs across contains more than 20 billion solar masses. Thus the dynamics of our Galaxy, outside of the central few parsecs are hardly influenced by the black hole at all. What holds the Milky Way together? The gravity of everything else - stars, gas, dust, dark matter (the latter probably being the most important once you get to galactocentric radii beyond the Sun). 

The accretion of dark matter by a black hole is possible, but difficult. Unless its trajectory takes it into the black hole, then it will simply approach the black hole, speed up and then escape again, since non-interacting dark matter cannot dissipate energy in any way. Presuming a black hole did accrete the dark matter then the energy possessed by the dark matter would become part of the rest mass energy of the black hole. So yes, the black hole would grow. Not sure what you mean by recycle the energy. Energy is always recycled (conserved). If you mean can the black hole lose its rest mass energy? I suppose it may do via Hawking radiation, but this is vanishingly small for a SMBH. The dark matter will also carry angular momentum into the BH and there are ways that this rotational energy can be extracted (e.g. the Penrose process $URL$ ). 

A comet that travels to the Sun from the Oort cloud will be travelling roughly at its escape velocity at perihelion. The fastest comets will be those that travel from the Oort cloud and plunge directly into the Sun. If you want the comet to emerge from around the Sun, then its perihelion distance must be no lower than $\sim 7 \times 10^{8}$ m. At that point it will have approximately the escape velocity at that radius $v_{esc} = (2GM_{\odot}/r)^{1/2} = 617$ km/s or 1.39 million miles per hour. Therefore I expect that lots of comets have attained something like or exceeding this speed before. Comet Lovejoy for example achieved a perihelion distance of $8.36\times10^{8}$ m and was travelling at 536 km/s (1.2 million miles per hour, and in fairly good agreement with the formula I quoted above - the aphelion was not infinity, but $\sim 157$ au, which largely accounts for the difference).
