EDIT: This answer is wrong: as pointed out by Alfonz, this map is not algebraic. The similar one with a rational approximation of $\sqrt2$ is, but then the degree is unbounded. Consider the following map $f$ from $\mathbb R^2$ to the torus $\mathbb T^2=\mathbb R^2/\mathbb Z^2$: $$ f(x,y) = (x, \sqrt2 x) \bmod \mathbb Z^2 . $$ Its set of critical values equals its image and it is dense in the torus, so the $\epsilon$-neighborhood has full measure for any $\epsilon>0$. 

I don't know what is the "tangent cone" argument you mention, but anyway here is my favorite proof of the fact. The stereographic projection is the restriction of an inversion $I$ from $\mathbb R^{n+1}\setminus \{p\}$ to itself, where $p$ is the pole from which you project (or maybe $I$ is a map from $\mathbb R^{n+1}\cup\{\infty\}$ to itself if you prefer it this way). So it suffices to prove that $I$ sends circles to circles and lines. First observe that $I$ sends $n$-spheres and hyperplanes to $n$-spheres and hyperplanes. (This follows from the planar case with circles and lines and rotation symmetry. The planar case is elementary). In $\mathbb R^3$, every circle is an intersection of two spheres. Hence its image is an intersection of two sets each of which is a sphere or a plane. Such set is a circle again. In higher dimensions, either restrict to a suitable 3-dimensional subspace, as Agol said in his answer, or represent a circle as an intersection of several spheres. 

First, the (simple!) setup: I have a Markov chain X t on some finite state space Ω with stationary distribution π, and a function f from Ω to R. I'd like to estimate the integral of f with respect to π, which I'll write E π (f). There are theorems which say that $\frac{1}{n} \Sigma_{t=1}^{n} f(X_{t})$ converges to E π (f) as n goes to infinity. Now, if the $X_{t}$ were iid, then the Berry-Esseen theorem would give error rates in terms of n and (say) the maximum value of f. Are there similar theorems which give error rates in terms of n, the maximum value of f, and one (or several) of the frequently computed statistics of finite state Markov chains, like relaxation time, mixing time, covering time, etc? I'm vaguely aware of Sanov-type theorems for Markov chains, which give large-deviation results, but not in terms of these sorts of quantities, and I don't see how to convert the bounds immediately. Alternatively, I'd be very happy if anyone can give a reference for places that people have actually computed the sorts of error terms that do show up in statements of Sanov's theorem for some simple random walks. EDIT: Added Mark's comments, so that the question might actually make some sense now. In particular, fixed a missing f, and the rather more important mistake that in fact the CLT doesn't give any sort of quantitative bounds by itself. FURTHER EDIT: I accepted D. Zare's answer, since it certainly works. If anybody is interested in this question, I have since seen a bunch of articles, the latest of which is 'Optimal Hoeffding Bounds for Discrete Reversible Markov Chains' by C. Leon, which are a bit more specialized to the Markov chain case. I have also been told that Brad Mann's thesis is worth reading on the subject, but haven't yet picked up a copy myself. 

At least for unital C*-algebras, the answer is yes. A proof plus explanatory comments are provided by Paul Skoufranis, $URL$ - look for the theorem on page 11 (here the algebras are assumed to be unital, though I didn't check whether one can extend this to the non-unital case). If you look at the theorem on page 16, you'll see that the map you started with needs to be completely positive. edit: The paper of Jürgen Schweizer in $URL$ may be of interest to you. Look for paragraph 1.5. The relation between a Hilbert bimodule and the notion of a correspondence used there is probably a bit subtle. A warning to end with: I have seen other notions of a correspondence, e.g. the one used in Katsura's papers A class of C*-algebras generalizing..., so be aware! 

Let $G$ be a (countable) discrete abelian group and denote by $\hat{G}$ its Pontryagin dual, i.e. the compact abelian group of group homomorphisms $\chi:G \longrightarrow \mathbb{T}$. Recall that, for a subgroup $H \subset G$, the annihilator is given by $H^\perp = \{\chi \in \hat{G} \mid \chi(g) = 1~\forall g \in H\}$. If $H_1$ and $H_2$ are subgroups of $G$, then $H_1^\perp H_2^\perp$, the subgroup of $\hat{G}$ generated by $H_1^\perp$ and $H_2^\perp$, is contained in $(H_1 \cap H_2)^\perp$. $\textbf{Question 1:}$ Do we actually have $H_1^\perp H_2^\perp = (H_1 \cap H_2)^\perp$? More specifially, let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be commuting, injective group endomorphisms of $G$. These correspond to commuting, surjective group endomorphisms $\hat{\alpha},\hat{\beta}$ of $\hat{G}$, e.g. given by $\chi \mapsto \chi \circ \alpha$. Note that we have $\alpha(G)^\perp = \ker \hat{\alpha}$. $\textbf{Question 1}$ now transforms into: $\textbf{Question 2:}$ Does $\ker\hat{\alpha}\ker\hat{\beta} = \ker\widehat{\alpha\beta}$ hold? Comments: We may assume $G$ to be countable or $\alpha(G) \cap \beta(G) = \alpha\beta(G)$ if that helps. Note that a similar statement does hold: $$\alpha(G)\beta(G) = G \Longleftrightarrow \ker\hat{\alpha} \cap \ker\hat{\beta} = \{1_\hat{G}\}$$ Here $\alpha(G)\beta(G)$ denotes the subgroup of $G$ generated by $\alpha(G)$ and $\beta(G)$. From this equivalence, one can deduce that the two questions from above have a positive answer in the case where $\alpha$ or $\beta$ has finite cokernel. 

Upper bound (assuming the manifolds are second countable): every manifold admits a complete metric, and the "set" of isometry classes of complete separable metric spaces is of cardinality continuum. Indeed, every such a space is a completion of a countable metric space, and there is only continuum of metrics on a countable set. Lower bound: there is a continuum of non-isomorphic fundamental groups of manifolds. E.g. any countable sum of cyclic groups is a first homology group of a connected manifold: just take a connected sum of an appropriate countable collection of lens spaces. 

I think PSPACE does not make much sense over arbitrary rings (it is better to consider classes such as PAR). Consider $R=\mathbb Z$ or $R=\mathbb Q$ with order. You can encode any finite collection of numbers in a single number and extract elements back in constant space. So you can emulate a potentially infinite memory in constant space (or linear, if you count the size of input). So anything decidable at all is in $PSPACE_R$. What $IP_R$ is depends on what kind of probablity distributions the verifier is allowed to use. In any case, I cannot imagine that problems like "is the given number a power of two?" (with input of size 1!) can be solved by IP in constant time. In the classic Blum-Shub-Smale case (that is, $\mathbb R$ with order), I suggest the problem "is the given number an integer?". It is trivially solvable in constant space and I'm sure it is not in (constant time) IP due to its infinutely many connected components. 

If there is no coupling s.t. the distance goes to 0 in $L^{1}$ (which I agree seems likely), you might want to look up an introduction to the Wasserstein-1 distance (which is exactly expected $L^{1}$ distance after an optimal coupling). This is the language that I've seen this type of problem most often discussed in. The field of finding optimal couplings for given metrics is 'optimal transport'. I vaguely recall that there are theorems about optimal couplings (in only certain $L^{p}$ only, of course!) never giving rise to crossing lines. In a 1-dimensional problem, such as the one you have, this would tell you what the optimal coupling is explicitly (in this case, if you construct your Brownian motion via Donsker's theorem, it says: whenever $W^{0}$ takes a move in the $\alpha$ percentile, make $W^{x}$ also move in the $\alpha$ percentile... in other words, my probably-misremembered theorem would imply coupling doesn't help your $L^{1}$ distance at all in this case). Cedric Villani has two excellent books on the subject, at least one of which was available for free download the last time I checked, and you should be able to find 'this sort' of theorem. Please don't take my word for the statements. Edit: Here is (I believe) a proof... though it might fit in the category of so-simple-its-wrong. First of all, we have starting points x,0 and add two normal (0,a) random variables X and Y to them. Plugging in the obvious cost functions, the "Kantorovitch Duality" formula tells us that the $L^{1}$ distance between x+X and 0+Y is at least x (while plugging in the independent coupling to the standard way of writing this metric tells us it is at most x). So, at time a, the $L^{1}$ distance between the brownian motions must be at least x (since at time a they have the same distribution as x+X and 0+Y, and we have found this lower bound for ALL couplings, and in particular all couplings that come from them both being brownian motions). In particular, the $L^{1}$ distance can't go to 0. 

The T-tetromino is a T-shaped figure made of four unit squares. An $m\times n$ rectangle can be tiled by T-tetrominoes if and only if both $m$ and $n$ are multiples of 4. This was proved in a 1965 paper by D.W.Walkup, and the proof was "hands on". Some "algebraic" tricks like colouring or tiling groups can prove that $mn$ must be a multiple of 8, but they do not seem to rule out the cases like $99\times 200$ and $100\times 102$. I wonder whether a better proof of D.W.Walkup's theorem is known today. By "better" I mean applicable to non-rectangular regions as well. For example, is there a way to determine what 6-gons (8-gons, ...) admit tiling by T-tetrominoes? 

You don't have to define your objects as sets, in fact, you should avoid such unnatural definitions. I don't think a number theorist would be happy to see a proof referring to elements of a natural number or using the identity $1=\{0\}$. Such proofs are not acceptable because they won't survive even the slightest change in the foundations. Similarly, if you develop Euclidean geometry, you don't define a point as a two-element set whose first element is a Dedekind cut and the second one is another weird set. You rather begin with axioms (either Euclidean ones or some axiomatization of the real line) and build the geometry on these. The set theory comes in if you want to show that your theory is consistent (as long as ZF is), and you do that by building a model within ZF. In your example with men, your actually create a mathematical model of whatever you want to study, in the same way as physics does. There are always translation steps from real world to mathematics and back, they just happen to be trivial in this case. So it's not a problem that men are (modelled by) sets. Only if you like to believe that mathematical objects do exist in some metaphysical sense, you will have a problem with the counter-intuitive claim that everything is a set. But you can just remove this axiom and stay agnostic about whether everything is a set or not. You will not lose anything - the only essential use of this axiom is that you are able to define the notion of equality rather than having it built into logic. And this is hardly of any importance outside the logic itself. 

Let $\mathbb{F}_2 = \langle a,b\rangle$ be the free group in two generators $a,b$ and let $\alpha \in \text{End}(\mathbb{F}_2)$ be given by $\alpha(a) = a^2, \alpha(b)= b^2$. Note that the index $[\mathbb{F}_2 : \alpha(\mathbb{F}_2)]$ is infinite as the family $((ab)^k)_{k \geq 1}$ yields mutually distinct left-cosets in $\mathbb{F}_2 / \alpha(\mathbb{F}_2)$. Let $D := C^*(\{ (e_{w,n})_{w \in \mathbb{F}_2,n \in \mathbb{N}} \mid e_{w,n} \text{ is a projection and } \mathcal{R} \text{ holds.}\})$, where relation $\mathcal{R}$ says that, for $m<n,v,w \in \mathbb{F}_2$, $$e_{v,m} e_{w,n} = \begin{cases} e_{vw',n} & \text{if } v^{-1}w \in \alpha^m(\mathbb{F}_2)\alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2) = \alpha^m(\mathbb{F}_2), \\ 0 & \text{else,}\end{cases}$$ where $w'$ satisfies $vw' \in w\alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2)$. $w'$ is uniquely determined up to right multiplication by some element from $\alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2)$. In particular, the projections commute and $e_{v,n} = e_{w,n}$ is equivalent to $v^{-1}w \in \alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2)$. Now $\mathbb{F}_2$ acts on $D$ simply by translation on the first index, i.e. $\tau_v(e_{w,n}) = e_{vw,n}$. $\textbf{Question :}$ Is $\mathbb{F}_2 \stackrel{\tau}{\curvearrowright}D$ amenable? The following additional information may be helpful: We can ask the equivalent question for the corresponding action $\mathbb{F}_2 \stackrel{\hat{\tau}}{\curvearrowright}\hat{D}$ on the spectrum $\hat{D}$ of $D$. Since $D$ is unital and generated by commuting projections, $\hat{D}$ is a totally disconnected, compact Hausdorff space. If we let $D_n := C^*(\{e_{w,m} \mid w \in \mathbb{F}_2, 0 \leq m \leq n \}) \subset D$, then $D = \overline{\bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} D_n} = \varinjlim D_n$, so $\hat{D} = \varprojlim \hat{D}_n$. From this one sees that a basis for the topology on $\hat{D}$ is given by cylinder sets of the form $$C_{(v_0,n_0),(v_1,n_1),\dots,(v_k,n_k)} = \{ \chi \in \hat{D} \mid \chi(e_{v_0,n_0}) = 1, \chi(e_{v_i,n_i}) = 0 \text{ for all } 1 \leq i \leq k\}$$ with $v_i \in \mathbb{F}_2$ and $n_i \in \mathbb{N}$. Let us look at the map $\iota:\mathbb{F}_2 \longrightarrow \hat{D}$ given by $$\iota(w)(e_{v,n}) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } v^{-1}w \in \alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2), \\ 0 & \text{else.}\end{cases}$$ Using the basis for the topology from before, it is apparent that $\iota$ has dense image. Since $\bigcap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2) = \{1_{\mathbb{F}_2}\}$, this is actually a dense embedding (but note that $\hat{D}$ is not a group). From this, on sees that $\hat{\tau}$ is topologically free and minimal since it acts transitively on $\iota(\mathbb{F}_2)$. A short comment: This exposition can be thought of as a minimal example for dynamical systems with a free group in countably many generators and a bunch of suitable group endomorphisms. Understanding amenability of the corresponding $\tau$ for such dynamical systems would make me really happy - but my current knowledge on techniques to show amenability of actions for highly non-amenable groups is fairly limited. So any hints on what may yield insights is appreciated. Concrete picture for $D$: From the initial data, we can pass to the semidirect product $S := \mathbb{F}_2 \rtimes_\alpha \mathbb{N}$. On the Hilbert space $\ell^2(S)$, let $E_{w,n} \in \mathcal{L}(\ell^2(S))$ be the orthogonal projection onto the right ideal $$(w,n)S = \{(v,m) \mid v \in w\alpha^n(\mathbb{F}_2), m \geq n\} \subset S.$$ Then $e_{w,n} \mapsto E_{w,n}$ defines an isomorphism $D \longrightarrow C^*((E_{w,n})_{w \in \mathbb{F}_2,n \in \mathbb{N}})$. This uses the idea of independent constructible right ideals for semigroup C*-algebras developed by Xin Li in $URL$ (Def 2.5). 

Q3: Laman's theorem is the same on the sphere. Indeed, a configuration with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is defined by a system of $m$ equations in $2n-3$ variables (there are $2n$ coordinates of points, but we may assume that the first point is fixed and the direction of one of the edges from the first point is fixed too). The the left-hand sides are analytic functions of our variables and the right-hand sides are the squares of the lengths of the bars (on the sphere, cosines rather than squares). Consider this system as a map $f:\mathbb R^{2n-3}\to\mathbb R^m$. The rigidity means that a generic point $x\in\mathbb R^{2n-3}$ cannot be moved within the pre-image of $f(x)$. This implies that $rank(df)=2n-3$ on an open dense set. Choose a configuration from this set and project it to the sphere of radius $R\to\infty$. The equations on the sphere converge to those in the plane, hence the rank of the linearization on the sphere will be maximal ($=2n-3$) for all large $R$. So we get an open set of configuration on the sphere where the linearization has the maximal rank (and this implies rigidity). Since all functions involved are analytic and the rank is maximal on an open set, it is maximal generically. So our linkage is generically rigid on the sphere. Conversely, consider a flexible linkage on the plane. If $m<2n-3$, it will be flexible on the sphere by a dimension counting argument. Otherwise, by Laman's theorem, there is a subgraph with $r$ vertices and more than $2r-3$ edges. Consider such a subgraph for which $r$ is minimal. Then, by Laman's theorem, we can remove some edges so that this subgraph remains rigid. And, by the above argument, it is rigid on the sphere too. So the edges that we removed were redundant both in the plane and in the sphere. Let's forget about them and repeat the procedure. Eventually we will get a linkage with fewer than $2n-3$ edges.
