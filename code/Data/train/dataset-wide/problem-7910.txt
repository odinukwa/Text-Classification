Block's theorem does not require the base field $k$ to be algebraically closed but one has to be careful when $k$ is imperfect. Then $k$ will admit field extensions of the form $K=k(a)$ with $a\not\in k$ and $a^p\in k$. Note that $K$ will become a truncated polynomial ring in one variable over a field extension $L=k(b)$ with $b^p=a^p$. If $p>2$ then the $k$-Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_2\otimes_k K$ is simple of dimension $3p$ (but not absolutely simple) and ${\rm Der}_k(K)$ is a nontrivial $k$-form of the Witt algebra $W(1;\underline{1})$ (such twisted forms can only exist over imperfect fields). By Block's theorem, the derivation algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ is the semidirect product ${\rm Der}_k(K)\ltimes {\rm ad}\,\mathfrak{g}$ of dimension $4p$ over $k$ but it is not isomorphic to ${\rm Id}\otimes_k W(1;\underline{1})\ltimes ({\rm ad}\,\mathfrak{sl}_2)\otimes_k k[X]/(X^p)$ over $k$. However, such an isomorphism will exist over $L$. 

The Schoenflies theorem, as a variant of the well-known Jordan curve theorem, states that the interior and the exterior planar regions determined by a simple closed curve (aka Jordan curve) in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (through Jordan curve theorem) are homeomorphic to the interior and exterior of the unit disk respectively. Equivalently, any Jordan curve $\phi : S^1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$, can be extended to a homeomorphism $\psi : \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ of the plane. A closer look at the proof of this theorem suggests that it might be a little bit choicy. This is indeed the case, according to the following result of Sakamoto and Yokoyama: 

Here are some definitions and results from the above papers. You may find further information in the mentioned references: Definition. A polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ over the reals $\mathbb{R}$ is $(k, n)$-ary if each $x_i$ is an $n$-tuple of variables. We say that a $(k, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is avoidable if the points of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be colored with countably many colors such that whenever $a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are distinct and $p(a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1})=0$, then there are $i < j < k$ such that the points $a_i, a_j$ are differently colored. The polynomial is unavoidable if it is not avoidable. Similarly, for an infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the $(k, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is $\kappa$-avoidable if the points of $\mathbb{R}^n$ can be colored using $\kappa$ colors such that whenever $a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1}\in \mathbb{R}^n$ are distinct and $p(a_0, a_1,\cdots , a_{k-1})=0$, then there are $i < j < k$ such that the points $a_i, a_j$ are differently colored. A polynomial is $\kappa$-unavoidable if it is not $\kappa$-avoidable. In fact, $p(x_0, x_1,\cdots , x_{k-1})$ is avoidable if the chromatic number $\chi (H)$ of its zero hypergraph $H$ is countable, and it is $\kappa$-avoidable if $\chi (H)\leq\kappa$. Example 1. For each $k<\omega$ and ordinal $\alpha$, the polynomial, $x_0+\cdots+x_{k}-x_{k+1}-kx_{k+2}$, in Fox' theorem is a $(k + 3, 1)$-ary polynomial which is $\aleph_{\alpha}$-avoidable if and only if $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{\alpha+k}$. Example 2. The $(3, n)$-ary polynomial $p(x, y, z)=||x-y||^2-||y-z||^2$, for $2\leq n<\omega$ where $||.||$ denotes the Euclidean norm in $\mathbb{R}^n$, is avoidable. Theorem 1. For each $n < w$ there is a countable partition of $\mathbb{R}^n$ which avoids every avoidable $(-, n)$-ary polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}$. Theorem 2. Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\geq \aleph_{m}$, every avoidable polynomial is $m$-avoidable. Theorem 3. Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{m}$, every $m$-avoidable polynomial is avoidable. Corollary. The followings hold: (a) Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\geq \aleph_{m}$, a polynomial is avoidable iff it is $m$-avoidable. (b) Assuming $2^{\aleph_0}\leq \aleph_{m}$, a polynomial is avoidable iff it is $\omega$-avoidable. 

In Bourbaki, Ch. VIII, $\S$ 7, Sect. 2, one can find the notion of an $\mbox{$R$-saturated set}$, and Corollary to Prop. 4 in that section proves that for every $R$-saturated set $\mathcal X$ there is a finite dimensional $\mathfrak g$-module whose set of weights coincides with $\mathcal X$. Prop. 6 in the next sections proves that the smallest $R$-saturated sets have the form $W.\lambda$ where $\lambda$ is minuscule. This answers Question (1). For Question (2) we take for $\mathcal X$ the union of $0$ and the set of all short roots in $R$. It is easy to see that this is an $R$-saturated set as verifying this reduces to root systems of rank 2 where everything is clear (even in type ${\rm G}_2$). Applying the above-mentioned Corollary we get a $\mathfrak g$-module with desired properties. If $\beta$ is the dominant short root then, by construction, our set will coincide with the set of weigths of $L(\beta)$ as that set cannot be any smaller. 

Update. According to Ian's remark in the comments section, it turned out that the notion of crossing number for wild knots retains some ambiguity, as (in contrary to the case for tame knots) there is no straightforward theorem guaranteeing the existence of a regular projection for wild knots, which is somehow essential for counting the number of crossing points in a wild knot. Roughly speaking, if you have a wild knot, you can't even be sure how much knotted it is! Another indication of why these crazy creatures deserve the name "wild"! Anyway, the soul of the original question remains valid even without any specification to the case of tame/wild knots of any particular characteristics in terms of knot invariants. The main problem is whether it is possible to add a morphologically new knot to the mathematical universe via forcing. Precisely: 

To each unipotent element $u\in G$ one assigns its weighted Dynkin diagram which is basically a map $\Delta\colon\, \Pi\rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ where $\Pi$ is a basis of simple roots of the root system of $G$. From $\Delta$ one can read off the characters on ${\mathfrak g}={\rm Lie}(G)$ of a maximal torus $T_0$ of an ${\rm SL}_2$ subgroup containing $u$ (all such subgroups are $G$-conjugate in characteristic $0$ by a classical result of Kostant, as David Stewart pointed out in his comment). If $\Delta(\alpha)=1$ for some $\alpha\in \Pi$ then $\mathfrak g$ has a faithful composition factor for the adjoint action of ${\rm SL}_2$. If $\Delta(\Pi)\subseteq \{0,2\}$ then all weights of $T_0$ on $\mathfrak g$ are even which implies that $-1\in{\rm SL}_2$ acts trivially on $\mathfrak g$. So the case of ${\rm PSL}_2$ occurs if and only if $\Delta(\Pi)\subseteq \{0,2\}$. In this case $u$ is sometimes referred to as even. All one has to do now (for $G$ exceptional) is to open Carter's book on groups of Lie type and examine the list of Dynkin labels on pp. 401--406. For $G$ classical it is explained in Carter's book how to construct $\Delta$ from the partition associated with $u$. So it fairly straightforward to figure out which unipotent elements are even for $G$ classical. Although any even unipotent element of $G$ has to be Richardson, there are plenty of them around. For example, all distinguished unipotent elements of $G$ are even. 

The above fact indicates that the occurrence of a Matryoshka phenomenon (i.e. having self-replicating structures) among certain types of mathematical structures may give rise to some large cardinals. In other words, a structure needs to be so large in order to be able to support a self-replicating Matryoshka-like structure. In this sense, JÃ³nsson cardinals have a characterization in terms of a Matryoshka phenomenon for certain type of mathematical structures, namely algebras. Here, the natural question to ask is whether there are other examples of a Matryoshka characterization for large cardinal axioms. In other words, what other Matryoshka phenomenona for mathematical structures do have some large cardinal strength? Precisely: 

Remark 2. Potentially, one may find some questions, related to the possible number/behavior of wild knots of the certain knot invariant (such as bridge, unknotting, stick numbers, etc.) in a forcing extension, interesting. However, for the sake of this question, I preferred to stick to a very specific one concerning crossing number. Please feel free to share your thoughts about other possibly interesting problems along these lines in the comments below. 

For all groups of exceptional types the answer can be deduced from the paper "Jordan block sizes of unipotent elements in exceptional algebraic groups" by Ross Lawther, published in Comm. Algebra, 23, Issue 11, 1995, 4125-4156. In order to determine the Jordan block sizes of ${\rm Ad}\ u$, where $u\in G$ is unipotent, Lawther used comuter-aided computations. The case of a general $x\in G$ reduces quickly to the case where $x$ is unipotent by using the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition in $G$. Of course, the number of Jordan blocks is just $\dim\ \mathfrak{c}_{\mathfrak g}(u)$, or rather $\dim\ \mathfrak{g}^{{\rm Ad}\ u}$, which is one of the numbers you are interested in. This number could then be compared with $\dim\ C_G(u)$ which is much easier to find in the literature (Spaltenstein's book on unipotent classes might have an answer). Regarding Steinberg's Problem 12, when $p=2$ the Lie lagebra of type $E_8$ is simple, hence has zero centre, but there are about 20 instances when the value of $\dim\ \mathfrak{g}^{{\rm Ad}\ u}$ jumps and becomes bigger than that for the counterpart of $u$ in good characteistic (these cases are starred in Lawther's paper). Since the number of "new" unipotent classes in characteristic $2$ is far less than 20, I think, there will be instances when $\dim\ \mathfrak{g}^{{\rm Ad}\ u}>\dim\ C_G(u)$. The orbit labelled $E_7$ could do the trick, but I didn't check. There is also a version of Lawther's results for nilpotent elements in exceptional Lie lagebras in the literature; see "Varieties of nilpotent elements for simple Lie algebras II: Bad primes" by University of Georgia VIGRE Algebra Group, published in J. Algebra, 292, 2005, 65â99. This paper also relies on extensive computer-aided computations. As far as I'm aware there is no computer-free proof of the above results at the present time, hence there is no uniform proof either. One could even say, on a more philosophical note, that nothing is uniform when $p$ is bad. 

Of course, the existence of such a nice natural number $n$ should be checked. However, it sounds reasonable to expect that for a sufficiently large $n$ (which there are so many open knight tours with various beginning and ending points) there are some tours which can serve as the building blocks of the knight's king-like spiral. (Actually only a few straight and right-oriented $n\times n$ tours with appropriate beginning and ending points are needed. The other blocks will be redundant up to isomorphism). Here, the first question arises: 

Remark 1. Note that according to the definition, there are no $1$-hyperprime numbers, simply because every natural number greater than $1$ arises as the addition of two smaller natural numbers. $2$-hyperprime numbers are exactly the usual prime numbers and the set of $3$-hyperprime numbers consists of usual primes and numbers like $12$ which don't arise as the exponentiation of two smaller numbers. In general, if $p>1$ is a $m$-hyperprime number for some $m\geq 1$ then it is $n$-hyperprime for any $n>m$. Remark 2. It is intuitively clear that almost all natural numbers are hyperprime in some sense, simply because the hyperoperator $*_n$ gets violently powerful when $n$ grows. Thus for almost any natural number $p>1$ one may find sufficiently large $n$ such that even the smallest combinations of natural numbers like $2*_{n}3$ and $3*_{n}2$ exceed $p$. So based on the increasing nature of hyperoperators, $p$ could not arise as the $*_n$ combination of any smaller numbers and is a $n$-hyperprime number. The only (magical?) exception is the eternally composite number $4$ which is NOT $n$-hyperprime for any $n\geq 1$ because $\forall n\geq 1~~~4=2*_{n}2$. Now the first question is: "How many hyperprimes of any type are there?" We know that there are no $1$-hyperprimes. Also, there are very few $2$-hyperprime numbers in the sense that the natural density of the set of prime numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ is $0$. Roughly speaking, the usual prime numbers are so rare among natural numbers that one may assume that there is almost no such number! But as stated, there is a promising increasing trend among hyperprime numbers of higher order. When $n$ gets larger and larger, the $n$-hyperoperator skips more and more numbers in its range (while receiving non-trivial input) leaving them as $n$-hyperprimes. Consequently, the corresponding set of $n$-hyperprime numbers gets rapidly larger by varying $n$. So one may cover almost the entire set of natural numbers this way eventually. Thus it is natural to ask: 

I agree with the answer below, but to turn it into a rigorous proof one could argue in a slightly different fashion: Let $l$ be the length of $w$ and let $Red(w)$ be the set of $all$ reduced expressions for $w$. Given ${\bf r}=(i_1,\ldots, i_l)\in Red(w)$ denote by $k({\bf r})$ the smallest $k\le l$ such that $i_k$ appeas in $\bf r$ more than once. Let ${\bf t}=(j_1,\ldots, j_l)\in Red(w)$ be such that $k({\bf t})\ge k({\bf r})$ for all ${\bf r}\in Red(w)$. Write $w=s_{j_1}\cdots s_{j_l}$ and let $w'$ be the element of $W$ obtained from $w$ by deleting $s_{j_k}$ from the above expression where $k=k({\bf t})$. By the choice of $k$ any reduced expression for $w'$ will have full support. Repeat this step until the length decreases to $r+1$. 

The adjoint action of $L$ on ${Lie}(U)$ is very rarely irreducible, but this does happen in your case provided that the derived subgroup of $G$ is simple. If $Lie(L)$ intersects properly with at least two simple ideals of $Lie(G)$ then intersecting ${Lie}(U)$ with those ideals we'll obtain some non-trivial proper $L$-submodules of $Lie(U)$. So assume from now that the derived subgroup of $G$ is simple. One knows that the centraliser $L$ of $\mu$ in $G$ is a Levi subgroup of the parabolic subgroup $P_G(\mu)=L\cdot U$ of $G$. Now $G\subset GL_{n}$ by our general assumption and, moreover, we know that the unipotent radical, $\widetilde{U}$, of the parabolic subgroup $P_{GL_n}(\mu)=Z_{GL_n}(\mu)\cdot \widetilde{U}$ of $GL_n$ is abelian (this can be checked directly by looking at $n\times n$ matrices). As $U\subseteq \widetilde{U}$ we see that $U$ is abelian, too. But then it is well known that $L$ acts irreducibly on ${Lie}(U)$, although all proofs of this fact seem to rely on the classification of simple algebraic groups (there is a related discussion of irreducibility on this website prompted by a question of Jim Humphreys). 

Note that the failure of any such theorem (in the absence of choice) may result in the existence of very bizarre topological creatures of certain pathological behavior which could be of some interest as counterexamples. (As an analogy, see Alexander's horned sphere as a counterexample for the validity of JordanâSchÃ¶nflies theorem in three dimensions). In order to narrow down the question 1, one may consider the case of the CarathÃ©odory's conformal mapping theorem (which implies Schoenflies theorem) or Alexander duality: 

Update. A MathOverflow fellow just emailed me expressing his interest in conducting some statistical research on MathSciNet and MathOverflow databases. He asked whether I know how to get access to the corresponding background data, which I actually don't. I am not even sure if it is publicly accessible or free (particularly in the case of MathSciNet and Arxiv). I also suspect that there must be some non-disclosure rules and restrictions which any corresponding research along these lines should follow. It would be nice if somebody who knows how to get access to the raw material needed for any research concerning these databases, sheds some light on these issues.
