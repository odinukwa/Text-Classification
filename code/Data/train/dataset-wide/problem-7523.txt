Does anyone have a good reference for the method of giving a topology to a distributive lattice as outlined in M.H. Stone's "Topological representation of distributive lattices and Brouwerian logics"? The full reference for that paper is: M.H. Stone, Topological representation of distributive lattices and Brouwerian logics, ˇCasopis Pešt. Mat. Fys. 67 (1937) 1–25. But I cannot seem to find an actual copy of the paper. Perhaps there are more recent references that outline the process in more modern terms, or perhaps it is very simply and can simply be described in an answer here. I have heard that the construction involves choosing ultrafilters, but from what I can glean ABOUT Stone's paper (e.g. a 1938 review of it by Saunders MacLane, Stone seems to do things in terms of so-called ideals of the lattice). Thanks for any help! 

So first I'll try to give a really quick reminder of the classical description of these things when one is doing non-commutative descent theory. In the setting of discrete algebra, if we have a morphism of (not necessarily commutative) rings $\phi:A\to B$, we can frame descent data for $\phi$ as $B\otimes_AB$-comodules, where we think of $B\otimes_AB$ as a $B$-coring. $B\otimes_AB$ also fits into the Amitsur complex for $\phi$, which lets us compute the set of descent data cohomologically. In the book Corings and Comodules by Brzezinski and Wisbauer, another approach is described. If one lets $K$ be the kernel of the multiplication map $B\otimes_AB\to B$, one can produce a DGA which at level zero is $A$ and at level $n$ is the $n$-fold tensor product of $K$ over $A$ (Brzezinski and Wisbauer call this the coring valued differential forms with values in the Sweedler coring $B\otimes_AB$). We'll denote this DGA by $\Omega^\bullet$. A connection on a $B$-module $M$ is an $A$-linear map $\nabla:M\otimes_B\Omega^\bullet\to M\otimes_B\Omega^{\bullet+1}$ satisfying the graded Leibniz rule. A connection always induces a curvature (i.e. $\nabla\circ\nabla$ restricted to $M$), and the connection is said to be flat if the curvature is zero. They then go on to show that flat connections are equivalent to descent data for the map $\phi$. Now, I'd really like to know what the equivalent construction is in the case of the $\infty$-category of $E_n$-ring spectra (it seems like $n=\infty$ is probably the easiest to figure out). Or, more generally, what should the analogous construction be for a morphism of $\mathcal{O}$-algebras be in some $\infty$-category (I'm fine with assuming we're looking at $\mathcal{O}$-algebras in some stable presentable $\infty$-category and that $\mathcal{O}$ is unital or whatever other adjectives you want to throw at it). In this scenario, the analog of $K$ above should be, I think, the relative $TQ$-homology (topological Quillen homology, or perhaps more correctly the relative cotangent complex) construction associated to $\mathcal{O}$. Moreover,we probably want to replace the DGA's above with cosimplicial constructions. We can easily construct the $\infty$-category of descent data for a morphism of $E_k$-algebras (see, e.g. this talk) as the category of cosimplicial comodules over the cosimplicial Sweedler coring (which is an $E_1$-coalgebra). Moreover, using the fact that there is an adjunction between the category of $\mathcal{O}$-algebras under $A$ and the relevant tangent category we can produce a monadic cosimplicial object over $A$ which looks very much like $TQ^n$ at level $n$. We might call this the $TQ$-complex and it is essentially the construction of Harper-Hess, figure 3.18 in this paper. Anyway, my question is essentially whether or not anyone knows if this is the right idea for connections in this setting or not. It seems like the obvious thing to do, but is it the case that flat connections (which should presumably be a map from the $TQ$-complex to a shift or delooping of the $TQ$-complex which compose to null homotopies) can be shown to be equivalent to the $\infty$-category of descent data? Another nagging question is whether or not this $TQ$-complex has totalization some kind of Hochschild homology, which would essentially be a more general version of the Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem). Any kind of references, or counter-examples, would be appreciated. I have heard rumors that Lurie had written down or given a talk on something of this nature, but I have not been able to find that anywhere. There is also this nlab page, but I'm not really too handy with cohesive $(\infty,1)$-toposes. 

A Hopf-Galois extension of commutative rings, as defined by Montgomery here, is a morphism of commutative rings $\phi:A\to B$ with a Hopf-algebra $H$ coacting on $B$ by a ring map $c:B\to B\otimes H$ such that the following two maps are bijections: 

Suppose I have a faithfully flat cover of schemes $\phi:X\to Y$, and a sheaf $F$ on $Y$. I might be interested in so-called ``twisted forms for $F$." That is, sheaves $F'$ on $Y$ such that $\phi^\ast(F)\cong \phi^\ast(F')$. In the case that $\phi$ is a cover by some collection $\{U_i\}$, this is often stated as saying that $F$ and $F'$ are locally isomorphic on this cover. Okay, great. You'll have to trust me that this is something I might be interested in. It is ``known" that if we compute $\check{H}^1(\phi,Aut(F))$, we can determine all twisted forms for $F$ (up to isomorphism class) along $\phi$. Or at least, that is what I believe people to be saying. 1) Is this the correct statement? 2) If so, can someone at least give me a rough explanation of why this is true, if not a complete proof? 3) Instead of starting out with a sheaf on $Y$, can I start off with an effective descent datum for $\phi$ and determine all twisted forms of that descent datum? In other words, can I start with a sheaf $F''$ on $X$ with effective descent data (which tells us that it comes from something over $Y$) and then ask for sheaves on $Y$ which pull back to (something isomorphic to) $F''$? How is their canonical descent datum (coming from pulling back) related to the descent datum on $F''$? 4) What can I do/say if $\phi$ is not faithfully flat? Can I still make these kinds of statements? What if I am interested in only finding twisted forms for one particular descent datum? I know this is a ton of questions. Sorry if it's way too much. Thanks!! -Jon 

In John Rognes' Galois theory monograph he constructs something called the Hopf-cobar complex for a coalgebra object $H$ (in spectra) and a comodule algebra $X$. It is, intuitively, the object whose totalization computes the (global sections of the structure sheaf of the...) quotient of $Spec(X)$ under the action of $Spec(H)$, if $X$ is a commutative ring spectrum. In degree $n$ it looks like $X\wedge H\wedge\ldots H$, with $n$ copies of $H$. The coface maps are given by either the coaction of $H$ on $X$, the diagonal map of $H$, or the unit map of $H$. Codegeneracies are given by either applying the counit of $H$ or the multiplication of $H$. This can be thought of as an explicit construction for the "cotensor product" of $X$ and $\mathbb{S}$ as $H$-comodules. This can in fact be made quite explicit if one works in a suitable framework for coalgebraic structure (e.g. this). On the other hand, if $X$ is a commutative ring spectrum, there is something called the Amitsur complex for $X$. In degree $n$ this has the form of $X\wedge X\wedge\ldots\wedge X$, $n+1$-copies of $X$. The coface maps here are given by using the unit of $X$, and the codegeneracies are given by the multiplication on $X$. This is not really given as any kind of tensor product, but rather as the effect of iterating a monad (the one given by tensoring with $X$) on $\mathbb{S}$ over and over again and considering the resulting cosimplicial resolution. In Proposition 12.1.8 of the aforementioned monograph (available here), Rognes proves that if we have an equivalence $X\wedge X\to X\wedge H$ given by $$X\wedge X\overset{1\wedge\Delta}\to X\wedge X\wedge H\overset{\mu\wedge 1}\to X\wedge H,$$ we can iterate this at each level to produce a cosimplicial equivalence between the two cosimplicial objects I described above (see Definition 12.1.7 op. cit.). He remarks that a diagram chase is necessary to show that this map is in fact cosimplicial, and moreover that it uses strict coassociativity and counitality of $H$. My question is the following: can one deduce the above equivalence in the setting of a quasicategories when one does not have recourse to a diagram chase, especially not one requiring strict commutativity of diagrams? It would seem that doing this in this setting would require having a deeper understanding of what those two cosimplicial objects are.
