I am learning about Quantum Homology which I have to use in my research, and I see that in many papers (For example in FOOO, "Spectral invariants with bulk, Quasimorphisms and Lagrangian Floer theory", $URL$ the homology ring being computed is given in terms of a Superpotential function. I understand that the relations in the homology ring are somehow encoded in its derivatives, and that it's critical point somehow correspond to Toric fibers with non vanishing homology, but nothing more than that and I have no clue about the details. What I am looking for is some exposition on the subject, some lecture notes, or somewhere where I can see a simple example being calculated completely from scratch. Can anyone please refer me so such sources? Thank you 

We consider the one dimensional cubic nonlinear Shr\"odinger equation (NLS): $$i\partial_{t}\phi (x,t) +\Delta \phi (x,t)= \pm |\phi (x,t)|^{2} \phi(x,t), \ (x, t\in \mathbb R),$$ $$\phi (x,0) = \phi_{0}(x)\in H^{s}(\mathbb R);$$ where $H^{s}(\mathbb R)$ is usual Sobolev space. In 1978 Giniberg-Velo have shown that the above NLS is globally wellposed: that is, for the initial data in $\phi_{0}\in H^{1}(\mathbb R)$, the NLS has a uniqe solution in $C(\mathbb R, H^{1}(\mathbb R)).$ 

My Motivation:(Importance of frequency-uniform decomposition operator); It is well-known that $S(t)=e^{it\triangle}: L^{p}\to L^{p}$ if and only if $p=2.$ But the frequency-uniform decomposition has at least two advantages for the Shr\"odinger semi-group: (a) $\square_{k}e^{it\triangle}:L^{p'}\to L^{p}$ satisfies a uniform truncated decay, (b) $\square_{k}e^{it\triangle}$ is uniformly bounded on $L^{p}.$ Thanks, 

I will present my question in the specifics I encountered it, so maybe some of the details are irrelevant for the desired conclusion. Consider $(S^2\times S^2,\omega_{std})$ the product of two spheres with standard product symplectic structure. $L\subset M$ is a Lagrangian torus in M. Given a family $\omega_s$ of forms, such that $\omega_0=\omega_{std}$ Choose $J_s$ an almost complex structure compatible with $\omega_s$. (which we are allowed to choose generically). Let $u_s$ be a family of Maslov 2 discs with boundary on $L$, converging to some bubbled curve $v$. Is there something I can say about the shape of the limit curve? The best case scenario would be a statement "If $J_s$ is generic, then the limit consists of two discs, one of Maslov 2 and the other of Maslov 0" I think I can rule out sphere bubbles by area considerations (A sphere in $S^2\times S^2$ has more area than the original disc), But as for discs I don't know how this works. Can I get in the limit discs with negative Maslov? Discs with Maslov $\ge 4$? a lot of Maslov 0 discs? Thank you very much 

Consider the space of all Fourier transforms of $L^{1}(\mathbb R),$ that is, $$\mathcal{F}L^{1}=\mathcal{F}L^{1}(\mathbb R):= \{f\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb R):\hat{f}\in L^{1}(\mathbb R)\},$$ with the norm, $\|f\|_{\mathcal{F}(L^{1})}=\|\hat{f}\|_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}.$ (By uniqueness theorem and using the fact that Fourier transform is a linear, one can deduce that, this is actually a norm) 

Let $\rho \in S(\mathbb R^{n})= \text{Schwartz space}, \ \rho:\mathbb R^{n}\to [0,1]$ be smooth radial function verifying $\rho(\xi)=1$ for $|\xi|_{\infty}\leq \frac{1}{2}$ and $\rho(\xi)=0$ for $|\xi|_{\infty}\geq 1$ [For $\xi=(\xi_{1},...,\xi_{n}), |\xi|_{\infty}:= \max_{i=1,2,...,n}|\xi_{i}|$ ]. Let $\rho_{k}$ be a translation of $\rho,$ $\rho_{k}(\xi):=\rho(\xi -k), k\in \mathbb Z^{n}.$ Let $Q_{k}$ be be the unit cube with center at $k,$ $\{Q_{k}\}_{k\in\mathbb Z^{n}}$ constitutes a decomposition of $\mathbb R^{n}.$ We notice, $\rho_{k}(\xi)=1$ in $Q_{k}$, and so $\sum_{k\in \mathbb Z^{n}}\rho_{k}(\xi)\geq 1$ for all $\xi \in \mathbb R^{n}.$ Denote, $\sigma_{k}(\xi):= \rho_{k}(\xi)\left(\sum_{k\in\mathbb Z^{n}}\rho_{k}(\xi)\right)^{-1}, \ k\in \mathbb Z^{n}.$ Then we have, (1) $|\sigma_{k}(\xi)|\geq c, \forall z \in Q_{k}$, (2) $\text{supp} \ \sigma_{k} \subset \{\xi: |\xi-k|_{\infty}\leq 1 \},$ (3) $\sum_{k\in \mathbb Z^{n}} \sigma_{k}(\xi)\equiv 1, \forall \xi \in \mathbb R^{n},$ (4) $|D^{\alpha}\sigma_{k}(\xi)|\leq C_{|\alpha|}, \forall \xi \in \mathbb R^{n}, \alpha \in (\mathbb N \cup \{0\})^{n}.$ Hence, the set $A_{n}:=\{ \{\sigma_{k}\}_{k\in \mathbb Z^{n}}:\{\sigma_{k}\}_{k\in \mathbb Z^{n}} \ \text{satisfies} (1) to (4) \}$ is non empty. Let $\{\sigma_{k}\}\in A_{n}$ and define frequency- uniform decomposition operator $$\square_{k}^{\sigma}:= \mathcal{F}^{-1}\sigma_{k}\mathcal{F}, k\in \mathbb Z^{n};$$ where $\mathcal{F}-$ denotes Fourier transform and $\mathcal{F}^{-1}-$ inverse Fourier transform. 

For a topological space M, It is known from homotopy theory that the elements of the first cohomology $H^1(M;\mathbb{Z})$ are in 1-1 correspondence with homotopy classes of maps $[M,S^1]$ In my case of interest M is a smooth manifold. Take $\alpha$ and take smooth $f\colon M \to S^1$ representing $\alpha$ under the above identification. My question is, under what (sufficient / necessary / equiv) conditions $f$ gives a locally trivial fibration (Fiber bundle) of M over $S^1$? I would prefer conditions in terms of homology / cohomology of M. What comes to my mind is that, according to Ehrshmann theorem, since $S^1$ is compact,this map is a fibration iff surjective + submersion. Surjectivity can be assured by picking nontrivial cohomology class. As for submersion. I have no idea how to characterize. Thanks 

Let $\mathbb T$ be a circle group, and $\hat{f}(n)= \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi} f(t) e^{-int} dt;$ $(n\in \mathbb Z, f\in L^{1} (\mathbb T)).$ Put $A(\mathbb T)= \{f\in C(\mathbb T): \hat{f}\in \ell^{1}(\mathbb Z), \ \text{that is}, \ \sum_{n\in \mathbb Z} |\hat{f}(n)| < \infty \}. $ $A(\mathbb T)$ is normed by $$\|f\|=\|f\|_{A(\mathbb T)}= \sum_{n\in \mathbb Z} |\hat{f}(n)|; (f\in A(\mathbb T)).$$ Suppose $f_{n} \in A(\mathbb T), \ \|f_{n}\|\leq M,$ (Fix, $M>0$) $$f(y)= \lim_{n\to \infty} f_{n} (y), (y\in \mathbb T)$$ and $f$ is continuous. 

(Hope this question is o.k. for MO) I have been learning PDE(non linear dispersive equations) techniques, mainly using harmonic analysis(kind of Strichartz estimates, estimates for unimodular Fourier multiplier); to solve it. But mainly with underlying framework function spaces, which I have seen so far, are functions/distributions on $\mathbb R^{n}.$ (For instance,Sobolev spaces $H^{s}(\mathbb R^{n})$, Besove spaces $B^{p,q}(\mathbb R^{n})$, Modulation spaces $M^{p,q}(\mathbb R^{n})$, etc..) 

Hello, I am looking for a source that discusses and teaches hyperbolic geometry from a synthetic approach (As opposed to the common analytinc approach in the poincare disk). I am looking for something more in spirit with eucld's elements or hilbert's geometry book. Thank you 

For every $m\in\mathbb{N}_+$, $k=0,\dots,m-1$, denote $I_{m,k}:=(\frac{k}{m},\frac{k+1}{m})$. Denote $W = H^1(S^1,\mathbb R^{2n})$ = The Hilbert space of $C^1$ maps maps $v(t)$ from the circle to $\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v$ and $\dot v$ in $L^2$. We will think of those maps as maps $v\colon[0,1]\to\mathbb R^{2n}$ with $v(0)=v(1)$. Consider the spaces: \begin{eqnarray*} W_m &:=& W\cap\{v\in H^1([0,1],\mathbb R^{2n}):\text{$v|_{I_{m,k}}$ is linear}\} \end{eqnarray*} Consider the projection $P$ from $W$ to $W_m$. Does $P$ have a kernel in the sense of convolution operator or Hilbert-Schmidt operator? Is there a closed formula? (This is reminiscent of the situation in Fourier series, where the projection onto the space of truncated Fourier sums is a convolution with Dirichlet Kernel) Thanks 

Let $a, b \in \mathbb R$ such that $ab> 1$ ; put $$L^{1}_{a}(\mathbb R)= \{ f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb C \ \text {measurable} : ||(1+|x|)^{a}f||_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}< \infty \},$$ and $$FL^{1}_{b}(\mathbb R)= \{ f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb C \ \text {measurable} : ||(1+|w|)^{b} \hat {f}||_{L^{1}(\mathbb R)}< \infty \}.$$ We consider a Foureier-Lebsgue space, $$FL:=L^{1}_{a}(\mathbb R) \cap FL^{1}_{b}(\mathbb R).$$ My question is: Does there exist a $f\in FL$ such that (the Fourier transform of $|f|$) $\widehat{|f|} \notin L^{1}(\mathbb R)$ ? (A bit roughly speaking, the question is about the investigation of the fourier transform of $|f|$ is in $L^{1}(\mathbb R)$ or not; once we killed the oscillation, in some sense) 

[The authors says it follows by the following two Lemmas 31 and 32: but I am unable to see how does it follows? My little effort, $p_{1}<p_{2}\implies M_{p_{1}, 1} \subset M_{p_{2},1}$; and so $\|\cdot\|_{M_{p_{2},1}} \lesssim \|\cdot\|_{M_{p_{1,1}}}$; so my confusion: if we have strong $M_{p_{2},1}$ solution how does it gives strong-$M_{p_{1},1}$ solution. Why the interval is SAME? How to use the following lemmas effectively? See also Remark 7 in the above paper(for getting the flavour how it is useful for global well posedness)] Lemma 31. Let $I$ be a bounded time interval containing $t_{0}$, let $p\in [1, \infty]$, and let $u\in C(I, M^{s}_{p,1})$ be a strong $M^{s}_{p,1}$ solution to NLKG. If the quantity $\|u\|_{L_{t}^{k} (I, M^{s}_{\infty,1})}$ is finite, then one has\ $\|u(t)\|_{L_{t}^{\infty}(I, M^{s}_{p,1})} \lesssim C(|I|) \left( \|u(t_{0}\|_{M^{s}_{p,1}} +\|u_{t}(t_{0}\|_{M^{s-1}_{p,1}} \right) \exp \left( \int_{I} C(|I| \|u(\tau)\|^{k}_{M^{s}_{\infty,1}} d\tau \right)$\ where $C(|I|)$ is some positive constant associated with the length of $I.$ [For the proof see the above paper, page no. 11; it is simple and follows as an application of Gronwall inequality] Lemma 32. Let $I$ be a bounded time interval containing $t_{0}$, let $p\in [1, \infty]$, and let $u\in C(I, M^{s}_{\infty,1})$ be a strong $M^{s}_{\infty,1}$ solution to NLKG. If the quantity $\|u\|_{L_{t}^{k} (I, M^{0}_{\infty,1})}$ is finite, then one has\ $\|u(t)\|_{L_{t}^{\infty}(I, M^{s}_{p,1})} \lesssim C(|I|) \left( \|u(t_{0}\|_{M^{s}_{\infty,1}} +\|u_{t}(t_{0}\|_{M^{s-1}_{\infty,1}} \right) \exp \left( \int_{I} C(|I| \|u(\tau)\|^{k}_{M^{0}_{\infty,1}} d\tau \right)$\ where $C(|I|)$ is some positive constant associated with the length of $I.$ [For the proof see the above paper see, page no. 11] EDIT: [In what follows I am trying to figure out the answer in line of comments given below by Willie Wong.] I used the Theorem 1 (local well posedness) from the same paper). Let $I_{1}$ be compact interval containing $t_{0}$ and $u(t_{0})\in M^{s_{1}}_{p_{1},1}$, and $u_{t}(t_{0})\in M^{s_{1}-1}_{p_{1},1}$; and therefore by Theorem 1, it follows that, $u$ is a strong $M^{s_{1}}_{p_{1}, 1}$ solution to NLKG, in the sense that, $u\in C(I_{1}, M^{s_{1}}_{p_{1},1}) \cap C^{1}(I_{1}, M^{s_{1}-1}_{p_{1},1}).$ And now as an application of Lemma 31; we get, $\|u(t)\|_{L_{t}^{\infty}(I_{1}, M^{s}_{p_{1},1})} \lesssim C(|I_{1}|) \left( \|u(t_{0}\|_{M^{s}_{p_{1},1}} +\|u_{t}(t_{0}\|_{M^{s-1}_{p_{1},1}} \right) \exp \left( \int_{I} C(|I_{1}| \|u(\tau)\|^{k}_{M^{s}_{\infty,1}} d\tau \right);$\ as you have pointed out: since $M^{p_{2},1}\subset M^{\infty, 1};$ it follows that, $\|u(t)\|_{M_{\infty,1}} \leq \|u(t)\|_{M_{p_{2,1}}};$ and so $\|u\|_{L^{\infty}(I_{1}, M_{\infty, 1})} \leq \|u\|_{L^{\infty}(I_{1}, M_{p_{2},1})}$ (is finite by hypothesis of Theorem 6, since $I_{1}$ is compact). And therefore $\|u(t)\|_{L_{t}^{\infty}(I_{1}, M^{s}_{p_{1},1})} < \infty.$ 

Given an n-dimensional polytope $P$ in $\mathbb R^n$, Given as a convex hull of a finite set of points, $S$ I would like to construct an expliict formula for a function $f\colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that $P=\left\{x\in\mathbb R^n \Big|\ f(x) \le 1\right\}$ Is there any nice known closed formula? It seems that there should be one in existance, as everything is piecewise linear. Moreover, I would like to ask the same question in the case P is given as intersections of half planes (hence, the data I have are normal vectors to the plane and distance from the origin) Thanks 

For an $A_\infty$-category $\mathcal A$, one defines the group $K_0(\mathcal A)$ by $$K_0(\mathcal A) := \mathbb Z \operatorname{Ob} \operatorname{Tw} \mathcal A / \left<[A]+[B]-[C]\right>$$ Where 1) $Tw$ is the twisted complexes category (a way of formally adding all cones, see, $URL$ section 3.2 for an exposition by Auroux.) 2) The relations are $[A]+[B]-[C]=0$ when $C$ is quasi-isomorphic to a cone of a closed degree 1 morphism $A\to B$ Can one somehow relate $K_0(\mathcal A)$ to $K_0(Fun_{A_\infty}(\mathcal A, \mathcal A))$, i.e. the $K_0$ of the $A_\infty$-category of $A_\infty$-endofunctors? Thanks 

For a bounded complex Borel measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb R$, we define, its Fourier-Stieltjes transform, $\hat{\mu}(y)= \int_{\mathbb R} e^{-2\pi ix\cdot y} d\mu(x); (y\in \mathbb R).$ Let $1\leq p \leq \infty $ and we put, $$X_{p}= \{f\in L^{p}(\mathbb R)\cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb R) :\hat{f}\in L^{p}(\mathbb R)\cap L^{\infty}(\mathbb R)\};$$ and we consider the algebra of Fourier-Stieltjes transforms(functions of Fourier-Stieltjes transforms), namely, $$B(\mathbb R) = \{f:\mathbb R \to \mathbb C : \exists \ \text{bounded complex Borel measure} \ \mu \ \text{on} \ \mathbb R \ni \ \hat{\mu}= f \}.$$ For $p=1,$ clearly, by inversion formula, $X_{p} \subset B(\mathbb R).$ 

Is it true that to study wave equation is equivalent to study the multiplier $e^{it |\xi|}$ ($f\mapsto (e^{i t |\xi|}\hat{f})^{\vee}$)? ( I don't see why this multiplier cover both the term in the solution. Can we deduce some thing about the multiplier $\cos t |\xi|$ and $\frac{\sin t |\xi|}{|\xi|}$ Background: I am familiar with the following solution to the wave equation: $u(x,t)= f\ast \partial_t W_t(x) + g\ast W_t (x),$ where $W_t = [ \frac{ \sin 2\pi t |\xi|}{ 2\pi |\xi|}]^{\vee}.$ (But here I do not see any square root sign; I guess, there must some thing to do with square root sign ....) 

I am reading a paper and there is some computation of RHom of sheaves that I don't understand. I hope this is the right place to ask. It is this paper, example 3.10 , page 25 arxiv.org/pdf/1005.1517v4.pdf In the first RHom equality there, They claim that: $R\mathcal{Hom}(k_{\Delta\times\{0\}}, k_{M\times M\times \mathbb R}) \simeq k_{\Delta\times\{0\}}[-n-1]$ Where, for a closed immersion $j: N\to M$ of manifolds we denote by $k_N := j_*j^{-1}k_M$ where $k_M$ is the constant sheaf on $M$, and the diagonal of $M\times M$ is denoted by $\Delta$. Why does the result come shifted by the codimension? How does one begin to compute RHoms of such sheaves in general? will deRahm resolution work? Thanks ! 

$\mathbb Z$ acts on the lattice $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ by adding an element to itself n times. I am studying some function arising from symplectic geometry which happens in my case to be naturally defined on $\mathbb Z \times \mathbb Z$ and is constant on each orbit of the $\mathbb Z$-action, thus it lives ob the orbit space. I am curious what kinds of algebraic/geometric/arithmetic structures does this set or orbits has, to compare with the behaviour of my function. Thanks
