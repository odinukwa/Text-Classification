There are many formulations of Zariski's main theorem, and Mumford's Red Book gives a very nice description of some of them, and of their interrelations. It is worthwhile remembering that it was in fact Zariski who first proved a version of his main theorem. Zariski was a geometer first and foremost (although he was also one of the greatest ever commutative algebraists), and so it is reasonable to look for the geometric content in this result. In fact Zariski first proved his main theorem before he developed his theory of formal functions (which was his method for proving connectedness theorems, and in its modern cohomlogical reformulation by Grothendieck remains the basic method for proving connectedness statements, as in Francesco Polizzi's answer). Zariski's original version of his theorem stated that if the preimage of a point on a normal variety under a birational map contains an isolated point, then the birational map is in fact an isomorphism in a n.h. of that point. As Mumford explains, what this result and the later variations have in common is that a variety is unibranch at a normal point, i.e. there is only one branch of the variety passing through such a point. Thus, if we blow the variety up in some way, we might be able to increase the dimension at this point (in the sense that we might be able to replace $y$ by something higher dimensional), but we cannot break the variety apart there. Grothendieck's formulation is very natural: it states that is we have a quasi-finite morphism, we can always compactify it (compactification to be understood in a relative sense) to a finite morphism. To see how this implies Zariski's original result, just observe that if $f:X \to Y$ is birational with $Y$ normal, and $x$ is an isolated point in $f^{-1}(y)$, then we can choose a n.h. $U$ of $x$ over which $f$ is quasi-finite, which then compactifies to a finite morphism. But since $Y$ is normal, any finite birational map to $Y$ must be an isomorphism, and so $U$ must be embedding into $Y$ via an open immersion. In short, $f$ is an isomorphism between a n.h. of $x$ and a n.h. of $y$. 

In the context of sheaves of $\mathcal O_X$-modules, there is the following reference: Prop. 3.9.4 in Lipman's Notes on derived functors and Grothendieck duality. A closely related result is in Neeman's paper The Grothendieck duality theorem ...; see Prop. 5.3. I'm not sure that analogous results should be expected to hold in arbitrary generality; for example, both references place a restriction on the base scheme, and require quasi-coherence assumptions. (In some sense, one has to reduce to the locally free case, where the statement is obvious. Quasi-coherent sheaves then admit locally free resolutions. The proofs of the cited results apply some form of this argument in rather subtle and sophisticated ways.) 

Reading Olivier's comment reminded me that it is always possible to verify rigorously, for a given elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb Q$ for which the rank of $E({\mathbb Q})$ is at most $3$, that one has an equality of algebraic and analytic ranks (i.e. in the notation of the question, whether or not $r = d$), assuming that it is indeed true. The point is the following: one can compute the sign of the functional equation, and hence the parity of the order of vanishing of $L(E,s)$ at $s = 1$ (i.e. the parity of $r$, in the notation of the question). If this parity is even, one proceeds as follows: the computation of $L(E,1)/\Omega$ (where $\Omega$ is the real period of the curve) is exact (one does it via modular sybmols), and in particular one can determine whether or not $L(E,1)$ vanishes. If the rank of $E({\mathbb Q})$ vanishes, then one expects that in fact $L(E,1)$ is non-zero; if not, one has a counterexample to BSD. Now if the rank of $E({\mathbb Q})$ equals 2, then one knows that necessarily $L(E,1)$ vanishes, and that in fact it must vanish to order at least 2. On the other hand, one can approximate the 2nd derivative of $L(E,s)$ at $s = 1$ as accurately as one wants, and so in particular, can verify that it doesn't equal zero (again, as must be the case if BSD is true). If the rank of $E({\mathbb Q})$ is 1 or 3, then one expects that $L(E,1)$ vanishes with odd order, and this can be verified by computing the sign in the functional equation (and if it doesn't hold, again one has a counterexample to BSD). The Gross-Zagier formula lets one compute the derivative of $L(E,s)$ at $s = 1$, by using an explicit modular parameterization of $E$ and seeing if the Heegner point is torsion or not; if it doesn't vanish, then one know that the rank of $E({\mathbb Q})$ must be 1. If it does vanish, then the rank of $E({\mathbb Q})$ will have to be 3 (or else BSD fails), and one knows that $L(E,s)$ vanishes at $s = 1$ to an odd order that is greater than 1. Again, one can verify that the third derivative of $L(E,s)$ at $s = 1$ is non-zero, and so show that the order of vanishing is exactly 3, verifying BSD. (Otherwise, BSD would fail.) I suppose in practice it could happen that in the case of rank 2 or 3, the non-zero 2nd or 3rd derivative that you have to compute would be so small that it was hard to distinguish from 0. On the other hand, one can use the conjectural formula for the leading term (coming from the full BSD conjecture) to determine an expected lower bound for this term, and again this should be an actual lower bound unless BSD fails. (Here it is useful to note that the regulator and the order of Sha appear in the numerator of the BSD formula, so one doesn't need to know about Sha, or the precise generators of $E({\mathbb Q})$, to determine this lower bound.) I once (back in 1993) read a masters thesis from Macquarie University (by a student named Chris Daniels, if I remember correctly) which verified a rank 3 example via the above scheme. I don't know how many other examples have been verified. 

Dear Bryden, Hopefully I have things straight, and there is a general formula $i^!\omega\_X = \omega\_{X\_{red}}$. One then has the functorial isomorphism (of sheaves on $X$) $RHom_{\mathcal O_{X\_{red}}}({\mathcal F},\omega_{X\_{red}}) = Rhom_{\mathcal O_X}(i_\*{\mathcal F}, \omega\_X),$ for a coherent sheaf $\mathcal F$ on $X_{red}$. (Normally we would have to apply an $Ri_*$ to the source of this isomorphism, to put the RHom sheaves on the same space, and would have to have an $Ri_*$ in the formula on the RHS. But $i_*$ is exact, and in fact just identifies sheaves on $X_{red}$ with sheaves on $X$ via the identification of their underlying topological spaces. Now $RHom_{\mathcal O_X}(i_*{\mathcal F},\omega_X) = Hom_{\mathcal O_X}(i_*{\mathcal F}, {\mathcal J}^{\bullet})$, where ${\mathcal J}^{\bullet}$ is an injective resolution of $\omega_X$, which in turn equals $Hom_{\mathcal O_{X_{red}}}(\mathcal F,{\mathcal J}^{\bullet}[\mathcal I]),$ where $\mathcal I$ is the ideal sheaf of $X_{red}$ in $X$. Finally, this last complex can be identified with $RHom_{\mathcal O_{X_{red}}}(\mathcal F, RHom_{\mathcal O_X}(\mathcal O_{X_{red}}, \omega_X)).$ So we get the formula $\omega_{X_{red}} = RHom_{\mathcal O_X}(O_{X_{red}}, \omega_X).$ (And the derivation shows that this should be valid for any closed immersion, provided one is in a context where the dualizing complex formalism is satisfied, except that probably there should be some shifts in dimension in general, because the dualizing complex probably coincides with the dualizing sheaf place not in degree 0, but in degree $-dim X$. However, in our case the dimensions of $X$ and $X_{red}$ coincide, so this shift can be ignored.) Note that, as this formula shows, $\omega_{X_{red}}$ could be a complex, not just a sheaf. This is reasonable, I guess; in general, even if $X$ is CM, this needn't imply that $X_{red}$ is (I imagine). If in fact $X_{red}$ is CM, then I guess we find just one non-zero term in the formula for $\omega_{X_{red}},$ and so have $\omega_{X_{red}} = \omega_X[\mathcal I].$ With a bit of luck, the above is not bogus, and answers your question. 

(i) The union of two closed subschemes should be the smallest closed subscheme containing the two given ones; if you like, an initial object in the category of all closed subschemes containing the given two. In the case when the two given closed subschemes are $V(I)$ and $V(J)$, this is is $V(I\cap J)$. (The operation $V$ interchanges closed sets and ideals, and is order reversing.) (ii) In function-theoretic terms, a function $f$ (i.e. an element of the ring $A$) should vanish on $V(I) \cup V(J)$ (i.e. lie in the ideal cutting out $V(I)\cup V(J)$) if and only it vanishes on both $V(I)$ and $V(J)$ (i.e. lies in $I$ and $J$), which happens if and only if $f$ lies in $I\cap J$. Thus we are forced to define $V(I)\cup V(J) = V(I\cap J)$, if union is to have anything like its usual meaning. 

The Cheeger--Muller theorem (and related results) allow one to get some control over the torsion in the homology using an analysis of the spectrum of the Laplacian. For one application, see the recent paper of Bergeron and Venkatesh (which also contains a reference to the work of Cheeger and Muller). 

The fibres of any morphism of schemes are schemes over a field. If the morphism if of finite type, then they are finite type schemes over a field, i.e. are (essentially) varieties. Many arguments proceed from the case of a variety over a field, to the case of a scheme over an Artinian local ring, to a scheme over a complete local ring (a projective limit of Aritinian local rings), to a scheme over a local ring (say by descent), to the general case (by passing from stalks to neighbourhoods). For example, many results about abelian schemes are proved in this (or some closely related) way. (See e.g. Kevin Buzzard's answer, and see also Brian Conrad's answer for an example of this kind of argument in a different context.) 

In either the one or two dimensional case, there are two sides: Galois and automorphic. Let me talk for a moment about the $n$-dimensional situation. The Galois side involves studying continuous $n$-dimensional representations of the Galois group of a number field $K$. There are subtleties here about over what field these representations are defined, which I will return to. For now, let's imagine that they are representations into $GL_n(\mathbb C)$, hence what are usually called Artin representations. The automorphic side involves so-called automorphic representations of $GL_n(\mathbb A)$, where $\mathbb A$ is the adele ring of $K$. These are irreduible representations which appear as Jordan--Holder factors in the space of automorphic forms, which is, roughly speaking, the space of functions on the quotient $GL_n(K) \backslash GL_n(\mathbb A)$. (To provide some orientation with regard to this notion: Note that, by Frobenius reciprocity, any irreducible representation of a group $G$ appears in the space of functions on $G$ --- here I am ignoring topological issues --- and so any irreducible rep. of $GL_n(\mathbb A)$ will appear in the space of functions on $GL_n(\mathbb A)$. On the other hand, appearing in the space of functions on the quotient $GL_n(K)\backslash GL_n(\mathbb A)$ turns out to be a serious restriction --- most representations of $GL_n(\mathbb A)$ don't appear there.) The idea --- roughly --- is that $n$-dimensional Galois representations will match with automorphic representations. How does this happen? Well, $n$-dimensional representations have traces of Frobenius elements, so to each unramified prime we can attach a number. On the other hand, it turns out that automorphic representations have essentially canonical generators, which can be interpreted as Hecke eigenforms, and so (for primes not dividing the conductor of the representation) we get a Hecke eigenvalue. The matching is given by the rule that traces of Frobenius elements should equal Hecke eigenvalues. Let's consider the case of dimension $n = 1$: First, any $1$-dim'l rep'n of the Galois group of $K$ factors through $G_K^{ab}$, while the space of functions on the abelian group $K^{\times}\backslash \mathbb A^{\times}$ (which is the adelic quotient considered above in the case $n = 1$) is (by Fourier theory for locally compact abelian groups, and speaking somewhat loosely) the sum of spaces spanned by characters, so that automorphic representations are just characters of $K^{\times}\backslash \mathbb A^{\times}$. So our goal is to match characters of $G_K^{ab}$ with characters of $K^{\times}\backslash \mathbb A^{\times}$. Now global class field theory actually does something stronger: it directly relates $G_K^{ab}$ to $K^{\times}\backslash \mathbb A^{\times}$. In particular, finite order characters of the latter (which are just Dirichlet characters in the case $K = \mathbb Q$) correspond to finite order characters of the former, the $L$-functions match, and so on. Now consider the case $n = 2$: The quotient $GL_2(K)\backslash GL_2(\mathbb A)$ is not a group, just a space (and this is the same for any $n \geq 2$). Also, there is no quotient of the Galois group $G_K$ akin to $G_K^{ab}$ with the property that all $2$-dimensional reps. of $G_K$ factor precisely through that quotient. In short, unlike in the case $n = 1$, we can't hope to find groups that will be related in some direct manner (unlike in the case $n = 1$, where class field theory gives a direct relation between $G_K^{ab}$ and $K^{\times}\backslash \mathbb A^{\times}$); the relation really has to be made at the level of representations. Also, when you consider the quotient $GL_2(K)\backslash GL_2(\mathbb A)$, it is much harder (in fact, impossible) to separate the archimedean and non-archimedean primes. If you play around and follow up some of the references suggested by others, you will see (in the case $K = \mathbb Q$) that this quotient is related to the upper half-plane and congruence subgroups, and the generating vectors for automorphic representations are precisely primitive Hecke eigenforms (either holomorphic modular forms or else Maass forms). The archimedean prime contributes the upper half-plane, and the finite primes contribute the level of the congruence subgroup and the Hecke operators. Thus the analogue of a Dirichlet character in the $2$-dimensional case is a Hecke eigenform. (But it is better to regard the latter as corresponding more generally to idele class characters --- also called Hecke characters or Grossencharacters; these are not-necessarily-finite-order generalizations of Dirichlet characters.) If you really want to study just Galois represenations with finite image (i.e. Artin representations), on the automorphic side (for $K = \mathbb Q$ and $n = 2$) you should restrict to weight one holomorphic modular forms and Maass forms with $\lambda = 1/4$. (The former are proved to correspond precisely to two-dimensional reps. for which complex conjugation has non-scalar image, while the latter are conjectured to correspond to two-dimensional reps. for which complex conjugation has scalar image.) The other Maass forms are not supposed to correspond to any Galois representations (just as non-algebraic idele class characters --- those that are not type $A_0$ in Weil's terminology --- don't correspond to anything on the Galois side in class field theory), while higher weight holomorphic modular forms are supposed to corresond to compatible systems of two-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representations with infinite image (just as infinite order algebraic Hecke characters correspond to compatible systems of one-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representations --- see Serre's bok on this topic). As the preceding summary shows, the big picture here is pretty big, and the technical details are quite extensive and involved. There is the added complication that the proofs of what is known in the non-abelian case are very involved, and often use methods that don't play a role in the general story, but seem to be crucial for the arguments to go through. (E.g. Mellin transforms don't play any role in the general theory of attaching $L$-functions to automorphic representations, but in the case $n = 2$, the fact that you can pass from a modular form to its $L$-function via a Mellin transform is often useful and important.) What I would suggest is that you try to learn a little about Hecke characters beyond the finite order case, perhaps from Weil's original article and also from Serre's book. (Silverman's treatment of complex multiplication elliptic curves may also help.) This will help you become familiar with the crucial idea of compatible families of $\ell$-adic Galois representations, and see how it relates to objects on the automorphic side, in the fundamental $n = 1$ case. Then, to begin to grasp the $n = 2$ case, you will want to understand how modular forms give compatible systems of two-dimensional $\ell$-adic representations. The general statement here is due to Deligne, and can be learnt (at least at first) as a black-box. The case of weight 2, which includes the case of elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q$, is easier, and it's possible to learn the whole story (other than proof of the modularity theorem itself) in a reasonable amount of time. The case of weight one is special, and is treated in a beautiful paper of Deligne and Serre. The converse here (that every two-dimensional Artin rep'n of appropriate type comes from a weight one form) is at least as difficult as the modularity of elliptic curves, and so learning the statement should suffice at the beginning. And now you confront the difficulties in learning non-abelian class field theory: already in the two-dimensional case, the theory has some aspects that remain almost entirely conjectural, namely the conjectured relationship between certain Maass forms and certain two-dimensional Galois representations. So at this point, you have to choose whether you just want to get some sense of the big picture and the expected story in general (say by looking over Clozel's Ann Arbor article and the recent preprint of Buzzard and Gee), or to begin actually working in the area. If you choose the latter, then the big picture is useful, but only in a limited way: to make progress, it seems that one has to then start learning many techniques that don't seem to be essential to the story from the big picture point of view, but which are currently the only known methods for making progress (depending on what direction you want to pursue, these include the trace formula, Shimura varieties, the deformation theory of Galois representations, the Taylor--Wiles method, ... ).
