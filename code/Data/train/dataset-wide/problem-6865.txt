It looks like what you're really after is determinants of housing mobility or migration. You get that, you can then just apply it to a specific city and aggregate to predict. One of the earliest and most seminal works in this field was Rossi's Why Families Move, originally published in '56 and redone in '80. The book is here and a review is here. Another giant paper in the literature is Massey "Social Structure, Household Strategies, and the Cumulative Causation of Migration". It is also a little older (1990), but brings together a lot of the previous literature (great paper for lit review) and formalizes the decision making process of migration. Newer papers in the literature look more at specific issues related to relocation, like eviction, fertility and housing decisions, and connection with life-course events. 

First, it is important to note that there is a substantial literature both developing and using nonlinear VAR estimation (for example, see papers here, here, here, and here). The reasons linear VARs are seen a lot, though, are similar to the reasons that least squares (in its varying forms) is seen a lot. The model is very transparent and analytically tractable. This is a benefit for both pedagogy (analysis can be done on linear VARs just using lag polynomials) and for interpretation of results. You also don't run in to the concavity and global vs. local solution issues you do with big nonlinear problems, which can make your results more credible in many circles. 

Yes. It is a fair comparison. Human nature, market behavior and principles of finance and economics have not changed much in the recorded history of mankind. For example, the principles set forth by Adam Smith in his opus The Wealth of Nations are just as relevant today as they were in 1776 when the book was published. 

Price elasticity of demand is related (but not equal) to the inverse of the slope of the demand curve. This Wikipedia article defines PED as: 

Convenience premium. The market prices in a premium for convenience. This explains why hot dogs cost more inside the ballpark than at the convenience store outside the ballpark. And why convenience store goods cost more than those sold at the supermarket. Put another way: Part of the cost of an item is not just the cost of materials and labor to get it there, but there is also a cost of availability. In other words, when you don't purchase the gas on the highway, the cost of it being available there is still present. Which you pay when you buy. Note: This answer agrees with the price elasticity explanation given by @Ubiquitous but avoids the price elasticity concept in favor of the perhaps more lay concept of convenience premium. 

A representative agent chooses a consumption time-path to maximize expected discounted utility $E\left[\sum_{i=0}^\infty\beta^i U(c_{t+i})|\Omega_t\right]$, where $\Omega_t$ is the information set at time $t$, subject to the inter-temporal budget constraint, $c_t + p_tq_t = r_tq_{t-1} + w_t$, for all $t$. The optimal consumption path satisfies: $p_tU'(c_t) = \beta E[r_{t+1}U'(c_{t+1})|\Omega_t]$, for all $t$ Which gives the Euler equation: $E[\beta(r_{t+1}/p_t)[U'(c_{t+1}) / U'(c_t)]|\Omega_t] - 1 = 0$. He then imposes the CRRA utility function $U(c_t) = c_t^{1-\gamma}/(1-\gamma)$, making the Euler equation become $E[\beta(r_{t+1}/p_t)(c_{t+1}/c_t)^{-\gamma}|\Omega_t] - 1 = 0$. This yields the moment equations: $E[\{\beta(r_{t+1} / p_t)(c_{t+1} / c_t)^{-\gamma} - 1\}z_t] = E[E[\beta(r_{t+1} / p_t)(c_{t+1} / c_t)^{-\gamma} - 1|\Omega_t]z_t] = 0$ with $z_t$ a vector of instruments belonging to $\Omega_t$. 

The only reason I can see right now could possibly be pedagogical. While that term does indeed just equal zero, there could be generalizations where the agent works a high amount with probability $\tau$ and a low, but positive, amount with probability $1-\tau$. In this case, the term would still go through. There are also plenty of functional forms that would result in that term not being zero (taking away the -1, for example, which is often done in applied work). At any rate, this is an idiosyncratic enough case that the professor might have thought it best to show the process of rearranging terms for future reference and to give help with other scenarios. On the other hand, he may just not have noticed it. :) 

The marshallian demand functions are solutions to the utility maximization problem. That is, the solution to $$ \max u(\textbf{x})\\ s.t. \textbf{p}\cdot \textbf{x} = m $$ Where boldface is used to represent vectors. In your problem, you would use your utility function, and $\textbf{p}\cdot \textbf{x} = p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + p_3x_3$ The other answer provides a link that I believe shows how to derive the formulas. I just wanted to explicitly state that marshallian demands are solutions to the utility maximization problem. If you know how to solve a maximization problem (using FOC and/or lagrangians), you can derive the marshallian demands. 

I guess it just follows by definition. Assume that in the high state (for household $i$, aggregate endowment is 10, and household $i$ consumes $1/5 = 2$ of this, while having an endowment of $5$. Now consider what happens if we were in the low state (for household $i$), where household $i$ only gets $1$ of whatever endowment. However, if this is a high state for some other household(s), such that the aggregate endowment is still $10$, since the fraction is constant household $i$ still consumes $2$, even though they have a smaller endowment. Similarly for across time consumption sharing (although a bit weird since the model has no storage...). I guess it works that, if aggregate endowments are the same across two time periods, a household will consume the same amount regardless of whether their endowment was large or small (basically, they contribute to others when they have a lot (they lend), and they take contributions when they have little (they borrow). Thus, consumption smoothing. 

It would depend a lot on how the debt was "erased." If you are simply suggesting a transfer payment from creditor to debtor, what would force such an event? Or would it be voluntary? If it were forced, then you would have a threat to private property rights and therefore, a disincentive for further lending. Security of capital would be diminished and all investment might stop overnight. This question is very broad. But the answer of what might happen would depend very much on the details of how all this might come about. 

There is also this concept of creative destruction. Which basically means that old less productive technologies must die in order to free up resources to be made available to new, more productive technologies. It's analogous to pruning. But it occurs naturally in a free market economy and does not require management or government intervention. Protectionism impedes the natural and beneficial process of creative destruction. 

Corporations are essential and they do provide benefits to the overall economy. Corporations are essential in the sense than individuals, when given the freedom to choose, do choose to invest their capital in corporations. And these corporations, in turn, use this capital to produce products and services which other people voluntarily purchase. Corporations are a net benefit to the economies in which they operate because they produce products which customers voluntarily purchase for prices which allow the corporations to return a profit to their shareholders. To the extent there are exceptions to this vis-a-vis crony corporations and government subsidies, the previous paragraph is notwithstanding. 

It's actually pretty straight forward. The implicit function theorem for two variables is given as follows (as long as some regularity conditions hold): For $F(x, y) = 0$, $ \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{\partial F / \partial x}{\partial F / \partial y} $ In the case of MRS, we want the marginal change in $x$ associated with a marginal change in $y$ required to maintain a certain level of utility, $c$, such as (conveniently) $c=0$. So, starting with $U = U(x, y) = 0$, we have $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{U_x}{U_y}$ Note that $c=0$ is just a simplification for exposition. For a general $c$, you can just subtract it from either side of the equation and you get the same result since $c$ disappears in the derivative. 

To elaborate on what has been said in the comments already, using GMM based on Euler Equations generally involves uncertainty that motivates some sort of expected orthogonality between a moment equation and some instruments. Here is a common example of a "Consumption-Based Asset-Pricing Model" (see, for example, Campbell, 1993, 1996) posted by Dave Giles: 

Actually, Section 3 of the paper you linked is probably one of the most comprehensive lists you could find of the movers and the shakers with regard to predictive game theory. I know that many of them have both published and working papers addressing these issues. Fudenberg even addresses those specific two topics. A few selections from the paper: 

No need to seek a mechanism because the inverted yield curve occurs by definition in the scenario you describe. This Investopedia video defines inverted yield curve as follows: 

If short term rates are positive and long term rates are negative then short term rates must be higher than long term rates. Therefore, the yield curve will be considered inverted by definition. Remember, central banks set the interbank overnight lending rate as a matter of policy. In the U.S., this is called the Federal Reserve Funds Rate. This is the shortest possible maturity. So this is the leftmost point on the yield curve. By contrast, supply-demand equilibrium (i.e., the market) sets long-term bond prices. And, as we know, bond prices are inversely correlated to their yields. So when the market demand increases for long term bonds, their prices rise and their yields fall. 

In nearly every public school district in the U.S., one can observe the following pattern: There are fewer middle schools than elementary schools. And there are fewer high schools than middle schools. (And the count of students per school goes inversely as the count of schools.) But why is this the case? Is there any explanation for this based on economic principles? For example, why is the reverse not the case? Why are there not fewer elementary schools than high schools, let's say?
