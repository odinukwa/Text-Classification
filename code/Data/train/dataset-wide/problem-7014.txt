The quote describes a very specific situation, which is not the general description through which the "law of supply and demand" is presented in non-technical terms. It says 

As a comment noted, value-added is the way to go. And how do we measure value added at the level of an individual firm? It is $$\text{Value-added} = \text{Wages and Salaries incl. Insurance}+\text{Depreciation}+\text{Profits before Taxes}$$ "Wages and Salaries including social security fees" is the reward of Labor, while "Depreciation plus Profits before Taxes" is the (gross) reward of Capital. This makes sense because if one views GDP from the "income" angle, it goes to these two aggregates of productive inputs, "Labor" and "Capital". All other expenses that appear in a company's Profit & Loss Statement are "third-party costs", or value that other productive entities create. Depending also on the jurisidiction, in most cases Labor costs, Depreciation and Profits before Taxes can be found as separate items in the financial statements of a company. 

If I understand correctly we have observed earnings first-differences that we decompose into an "expected" part and an "unexpected" part. But f they are unexpected, it means something like $$y_{t+1} -y_t = h(I_t) + u_{t+1} , \;\;E(u_{t+1}\mid I_t)=0$$ where $I_t$ is the "information set" (in the broad sense) at time $t$. So by construction, the unexpected part will have conditional mean zero. But , this does not imply necessarily that $u_{t+1}$ will also have a symmetric distribution around zero. If as you conjecture, there are "more shocks downwards (negative) rather than downwards", the distribution will have more probability mass in the negative. Then, in order to maintain a zero-mean the distribution will have to have higher values on the positive: more and smaller negative shocks, fewer and higher positive shocks. Something like a shifted to the left gamma distribution, so as to have zero-mean, 

The concept of immiserizing growth describes a situation where a mainly exporter country that grows, finds itself worse-off because the terms of trade (relative prices) change too much against it. Immiserizing growth has generated some theoretical interest in the past, and various situations have been determined under which such a phenomenon may arise, enhancing the original contributions by Johnson, Harry G. 1955. "Economic Expansion and International Trade," Manchester School 23, pp. 95-112 and Bhagwati, Jagdish. 1958. "Immiserizing Growth: A Geometrical Note," Review of Economic Studies 25, (June), pp. 201-205. I do not know of any real-world example though. On the contrary some studies have been conducted which have estimated the critical values for the variables of a real-world economy, in order for it to face the possibility of immiserizing growth-and these thresholds are not observed in practice. As an example, Ramon Lopez (1991), in "Microeconomic Distortions: Static Losses and their Effect on the Efficiency of Investment", studying the economy of Chile for the period 1974-1989, estimated that, under full employment, the critical tariff rate for the prospect of immiserizing growth to arise would be $185$%, while with unemployment, it would be $260$%, which are too high compared to observed tariff rates. The real concern about International Trade is its distributional effects inside each country, i.e. whether it creates "misery" for part of the population, while benefiting some other part. This is also "immiserizing growth" (for some of the citizens) but not in the sense meant by the scholars that originally coined the term. 

For a second-order stationary series it is the correlation coefficient between the dependent value and its lag. Specify $$y_{t+1} = a+ \beta y_t + u_{t+1}\qquad u_{t+1}= \text{white noise}$$ The correlation coefficient between $y_{t+1}$ and $y_{t}$ is defined as usual $$\rho_{(1)} = \frac{\text{Cov}(y_{t+1},y_{t})}{\sigma(y_{t+1})\sigma(y_t)}$$ $$\text{Cov}(y_{t+1},y_{t}) = E(y_{t+1}y_{t}) - E(y_{t+1})E(y_{t})$$ $$ = E\Big((a+\beta y_t+u_{t+1})y_{t}\Big) - E(y_{t+1})E(y_{t}) = aE(y_t)+\beta E\Big(y_t^2+u_{t+1}y_{t}\Big) - E(y_{t+1})E(y_{t})$$ We have $E(u_{t+1}y_{t}) =0$. Also, under first-order stationarity we have $E(y_t)=E(y_{t+1}) = \frac{a}{1-\beta}$ Using these we get $$\text{Cov}(y_{t+1},y_{t}) = \frac{a^2}{1-\beta}+\beta E(y_t^2) - \frac{a^2}{(1-\beta)^2}$$ By definition the variance is $$\text{Var}(y_t) = E(y_t^2) - [E(y_t)]^2 = E(y_t^2) -\frac{a^2}{(1-\beta)^2}$$ $$\implies E(y_t^2) = \text{Var}(y_t) + \frac{a^2}{(1-\beta)^2}$$ Substituting, $$\text{Cov}(y_{t+1},y_{t}) = \frac{a^2}{1-\beta}+\beta \text{Var}(y_t) + \beta \frac{a^2}{(1-\beta)^2} - \frac{a^2}{(1-\beta)^2}$$ Things cancel out and we are left with $$\text{Cov}(y_{t+1},y_{t}) = \beta\text{Var}(y_t) $$ Under the assumption of 2nd-order stationarity, $\text{Var}(y_t) = \text{Var}(y_{t+1}) = \text{Var}(y)$ Inserting all this back to the correlation coefficient $$\rho_{(1)} = \frac{\beta\text{Var}(y)}{\sigma(y)\sigma(y)} = \frac{\beta\text{Var}(y)}{\text{Var}(y)} = \beta. $$ Note that the presence of the constant $a$ does not affect the correlation -it would be the same if $a=0$. This is because location parameters do not affect second-order statistics like the covariance and the variance. 

Yes, either in an old fashioned "deterministic", $q_t=q_{t−1}$ way, or in a stochastic, $E(q_t) = E(q_{t−1})$ "mean-stationary" way. Assume now that demand is already mean-stationary according to your analysis , and you get the same question from the Sales Director as before. Will your answer change compared to the previous one? ANSWER 

The two papers that explored first savings under uncertainty in a two-period setting are Leland, H. E. (1968). Saving and uncertainty: The precautionary demand for saving. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 82(3), 465-473. and Sandmo, A. (1970). The effect of uncertainty on saving decisions. The Review of Economic Studies, 37(3), 353-360. They both deal with a general two period utility function $U(c_0,c_1)$ not necessarily additive. But both remark the following related to such a case: The condition for precautionary savings depends on third cross partial derivatives, as well as on the third own derivative with respect to future consumption only. If the utility function is additive $U=u(c_0)+Ev(c_1)$, then cross-partials are zero, so the result hinges only on the third own derivative for the second-period consumption. It follows that with an additive over time utility function, it suffices that the second-period utility is quadratic (so third own derivative is zero), in order to not get precautionary savings, irrespective of the form of the first-period utility. 

Profit, wage and rent are rewards for inputs used in production, they constitute a decomposition of Income (or the Income-decomposition of output produced) Inheritance is a transfer, it does not involve production. So it is invalid to try to fit it into the mentioned classification. Consider now any gift: say I work, earn a wage in the form of consumer goods, and give them to you. The consumer goods I got as a wage is a reward for my labor. Giving them to you is a transfer of already produced output. In inheritance, this output has already taken the form of assets rather than consumer goods. 

"Foreign Direct Investment" is to be understood as bringing in an economy productive capital, and not just purchasing power. When an economy is seriously below full employment (of capital and labor), than a case can be made that "printing money" (i.e. creating purchasing power out of thin air) may not result in just inflation, but it may indeed bring into production input factors (labor and capital) that are currently unemployed. Compared to Foreign Direct Investment, we have the following differences: Creating purchasing power through printing money relies on an indirect effect: you strengthen demand and expect that this will lead to increased supply, which in turn translates into higher employment/output. This may mitigated by a) increased imports rather than increased local factor employment to satisfy the demand b) institutional issues that may obstruct bringing into production the idle local factors c) imbalance in available unemployed factors - e.g. you may have too many unemployed people but not much unemployed infrastructure. Foreign Direct Investment in almost all cases is partly translated into imports (the foreign investors bring in their funds which are then partly paid back abroad to import capital infrastructure that is not available in the local economy), but apart from that similarity it a) increases supply and local employment directly and b) by design it takes a priori into account the possible imbalance in the availability of local factors, and corrects from them, since it wants to arrive at a factor mix that will be able to produce. In a more general perspective, we could say that by printing money, if the policy fails you will just burden the economy with inflation (which has transactional costs). But with Foreign Direct Investment, even if it fails eventually as a commercial enterprise, the local economy has nevertheless gained, even as a one-off, the part of the FDI that has been consumed locally: it is an inflow of real output from the outside world. 

So if your mind is fixed to thinking three inputs, (and a very realistic triplet at that), you won't go easily into thinking just two of them -and realize that you can represent them graphically. 

A few remarks and hints: We have to assume that each ad in each magazine is viewed by totally different people (totally unreasonable). Given this, then From your budget constraint, you obtain $c =12-2b$, so you can work with a single decision variable. Since you are asked about the feasible combinations of $(M,L)$ represented by a straight line, this happens in a diagram with $(M,L)$ measured in the axes. So you have to arrive at an expression of say $M$ as a function of $L$. How do you do this? Write $L$ (and then also $M$) as a function of $c$ and $b$ (from the information in the question). Use the relation obtained from the budget constraint to eliminate $c$ from both relations. Then solve for $L$ (and for $M$) each as a function of $b$. Equate the two to obtain the function expressing $M$ as a function of $L$. Then you can check which of the choices given conforms with this function. 

$$E(X) = 33.76 ,\;\; SD(X) = 12.3, median \approx 32.3$$ The empirical median is $32$ GDP percentage points. Note that $90$% of the countries (163 entities in all) are below $50$% public spending as GDP percentage. 

Bold letters my emphasis. Who on earth would ever equate the economic concept of Supply with the meaning of the word availability? Especially for goods that are not transformations of other goods and so embody a very tangible opportunity cost if left unsold (plus the unavoidable depreciation)? Sure, if I produce cars, I want my cars to be sold, and if a tax is imposed on them, even if I have to fully absorb the tax. I may change my behavior in the future, but right now I want to see my inventory sold. But it is by no accident that, globally, Accounting Standards prescribe that no depreciation is calculated for unimproved land (and if it is improved, then a portion of the value attributed to the landfield per se remains non-depreciated). This reflects the actual fact that the value of the land itself is purely a matter of surrounding circumstances. But the Supply of Unimproved Land can be much more easily reduced if prices fall, in the sense that the land stops being for sale. What such a tax can also do is to provide a "negative" incentive to sell, in order not to continue paying the tax. So in any case the tax will tend to affect the Supply of land :some landowners will withdraw their land from the market, even if this means bearing the tax, because they may figure that they can wait so that land prices rise again to an overall gain, while some others will be induced to sell the land they did not have up for sale prior to the tax, in order to not be burdened with the tax. On the other hand, Milton Friedman's "least bad tax" quote (from the same link) is a true economist's thinking: weigh the pros and the cons, try to give the world a clearer picture to help them decide. 

The observation that "as stock prices rise people tend to buy more of it, so here the "law of demand" holds in reverse", is one of the more widespread misconceptions related to economic thinking. To expand on @StevenLandsburg comment, the "demand curve" (or "schedule") describes a static relation between the quantity of a good and its price. Its quality (in the general sense of features, qualities) remains constant, as we trace the demand curve. In our case we think of the stock as the good, and we have also its price. Now what happens when the price goes up? Are we talking about the same good? Definitely no. The price raise itself signals that we now have a better good (higher discounted future profits). But then we have a different good. So the pairs $(p_1, q_1)$ and $(p_2, q_2)$ do not really belong to the same demand schedule. So the "law of demand" is irrelevant here as a tool to describe the situation (we could picture it as a shift of the whole demand schedule outwards) If one wants to try to think "intuitively" about the law of demand and stocks, then one can consider the following thought experiment: Assume that you can buy the same stock on the same day at two different prices (it can happen, the world is not really one single market, even for stocks -and transactions can happen also outside of the stock market). Assume that you cannot choose the seller, which will be determined randomly. But you have to commit beforehand about the number of pieces that you will buy. And you know the two prices. What are you going to do? Commit to buy more pieces if you are dealt the expensive seller, and fewer pieces if you are dealt the cheaper seller? Sounds ridiculously obvious, isn't it?
