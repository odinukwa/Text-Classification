I just happened to stumble upon this old question. The checked answer refers to a 1999 paper for a spectral sequence that was studied in a 1994 paper that addresses the question at hand: Annetta Bajer. The May spectral sequence for a finite $p$-group stops. J. Algebra 167 (1994), no. 2, 448â€“459. Here is the Math Review of that paper: ``Let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p>0$, let $G$ be a finite $p$-group, and let $gr kG$ be the graded $k$-algebra associated to the filtration of $kG$ by the powers of its augmentation ideal. The May spectral sequence of the title is a spectral sequence whose $E_2$-page is $Ext_{gr kG}(k,k)$ which converges to a filtration of $H^{*}(G,k)=Ext_{kG}(k,k)$. The author shows that this spectral sequence has only finitely many nonzero differentials, and deduces a similar result for a related spectral sequence converging to a filtration of $H^*(G,M)$ for $M$ a finitely generated $kG$-module.'' The published reference for the MSS in general goes back to 1966: The cohomology of restricted Lie algebras and of Hopf algebras. J. Algebra (1966), 123--146. ([3] on my web page). 

Here is a conceptual answer that tells you that although resolutions chain homotopy equivalent to projective resolutions need not be projective, they are perfectly acceptible to homological algbra. As with any form of algebraic homotopy theory, it is very nice to develop homological algebra in the context of model categories. In the case of chain complexes of $R$-modules, the identity functor specifies a Quillen equivalence between two model structures with the same weak equivalences, namely the quasi-isomorphisms. In the one in most common use (called the $q$-model structure in ``More concise algebraic topology'', by Kate Ponto and myself), a $q$-cofibrant approximation of an $R$-module $M$ (viewed as a chain complex concentrated in degree zero) is a projective resolution of $M$. In the other (called the $m$-model structure, opus cit), the $m$-cofibrant objects are those of the chain homotopy type of $q$-cofibrant objects, so an $m$-cofibrant approximation is the up-to-homotopy version of a projective resolution you are asking about. The Quillen equivalence is a kind of high level way of saying that the two kinds of resolutions can be used interchangably. 

Something very close to this and quite possibly relevant occurs in the theory of $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces. There is a notion of an action of an operad $Q$ on an operad $P$. When $Q$ acts on $P$, the monad on the category of spaces associated to the operad $P$ restricts to a monad on the category of $Q$-spaces. This is an instance of a general distributivity theory of one monad acting on another due to Beck. The algebras over this monad give a version of your hypotheses on $X$. Adapting to the context of $A_{\infty}$ operads, and crossing $P$ with the little $1$-cubes operad (for example) without change of notation, there is a resulting delooping $B(\Sigma,P,X)$ that is a $Q$-space. The details are an adaptation of those in Sections 1, 4, 8, 9 and Appendix $A$ of my paper "What precisely are $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces and $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra''. Geometry \& Topology Monographs 16(2009), 215--282. I hope that is relevant and apologize if it is not. Alternatively, there is a theory of tensor product of operads due to Boardman (and Vogt?) that might be relevant. I don't have the reference on the top of my head. 

Vipul, I don't have an answer to your question, but I thought I would remind you why divided power algebras are so very natural (in contrast ...?), since that makes understanding the many variable case easy, at least if you are willing to have your algebras be commutative. Working over a field (not necessarily of characteristic zero), look at a polynomial algebra and give it a bialgebra structure by letting its generators be primitive. The dual algebra to the resulting coalgebra is the divided polynomial algebra. This makes sense and gives the right (commutative) definition even if you have infinitely many generators. Of course, you have to be careful about saying the dual is a bialgebra, but it is in zillions of graded situations in algebraic topology where there are finitely many generators of positive degree (even if the characteristic isn't $2$). 

There is a nice theorem in geometric topology that a Serre fibration between actual CW complexes (not just homotopy types thereof) is in fact a Hurewicz fibration. It's in a paper by Steinberger and West (Covering homotopy properties of maps between CW complexes or ANRs, Proc AMS92(1984), 573-577), with a correction in a paper by R. Cauty (Sur les ouverts des CW-complexes et les fibr\'es de Serre, Colloq. Math. 63(1992), 1-7). Then the rest of your answer applies. But of course the proof of the cited theorem proceeds by checking homotopical local triviality and then quoting the local to global characterization of Hurewicz fibrations. 

Hi John, this is not a complete proof, but it should give the idea of one. There is a clever proof of the splitting of suspension spectra of $\Omega^n\Sigma^n X$ due to Ralph Cohen in his paper "Stable proofs of stable splittings". His proof is also given in section VII.5 of LMS "Equivariant stable homotopy theory". It applies more simply to give the splitting that you are interested in. Modernizing using EKMM Section II.4 (or symmetric or orthogonal spectra), the right side of your equivalence is equivalent to the free $A_\infty$ ring spectrum generated by $\Sigma^{\infty} X$. With minor finagling (about base points in particular), the freeness will give a map of $A_{\infty}$ ring spectra from right to left. It should be an equivalence by inspection of the cited proof. 

I'd like to expand on Dustin's point. There is simply no way to think sensibly about equivariant topology, whether algebraic or geometric, without taking account of multiple basepoints. Even taking account of them one runs into subtle difficulties invisible without them (see eg [65] on my web page). I'll give examples from algebraic topology, since that is what I know best, but examples from geometric topology must abound, as illustrated in other answers. Take a compact Lie group, or even just a finite group, and consider a smooth closed $G$-manifold $M$. What does it mean for $G$ to be orientable, and what is an orientation? These are seriously interesting questions, necessary to make sense of equivariant Poincar\'e duality, and they are difficult except in the boringly simple-minded case (treated in [53] on my website) when the tangent $G_x$-representation $T_x$ is isomorphic to the restriction to $G_x$ of an ambient $G$-representation $V$ for all $x\in M$. Usually there is no such $V$, and then I can't imagine answers that do not use functors defined on equivariant fundamental groupoids (which themselves are not altogether obvious to define.) Three references which give rather different answers to these questions are [93] and [100] on my web site, and $URL$ by Costenoble and Waner. I actually do not know how to compare these answers or to calculate with them. Again, while one can (twistedly) escape explicit use of fundamental groupoids when setting up the Serre spectral sequence with local coefficients nonequivariantly, one cannot do so equivariantly. Perhaps invoking equivariant theory is overkill, but the fundamental groupoid is such a natural thing, and so elementary, that it seems a little perverse to try to avoid it!
