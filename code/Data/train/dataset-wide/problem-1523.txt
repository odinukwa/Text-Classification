Does Polaris have a trail in the sky timelapse? Yes. Every star has a trail, but it's smaller if it's closer to the pole. Polaris is close to the pole but it's still 45 (arc)minutes away. I don't think it's visible with the naked eye; no star trail is visible with the naked eye as you only see one 'instance' of the sky. What perhaps would work, and is more feasible for stars closer to the celestial equator, is trying to see the movement of a star compared to an object on Earth, e.g. a tree, a building or the horizon. The exposure times of the photos are different, as @J.Chomel notes in the comments. You can calculate the exposure time by looking at the arc length; in 23 hours and 56 minutes (a 'sidereal day'), a star will make a full circle. The trails on the last photo have an arc length of about 8 degrees, corresponding to about 30 minutes; the first two photos are more like 9 resp. 5 hours. Also, the zoom factor (of the lens) may play a role; if a photo is zoomed in more, Polaris' movement is more likely to be visible. I'm not sure if this plays a role in this photos, though. 

I know light, and practically nothing but gravity can escape a black hole. My question is: can magnetism escape a black hole? A couple things that convince me it can are: 

This explains why objects with more mass have more gravity (e.g. each bit of mass is absorbing a small amount of space, so has gravity). The more mass you have, the more gravity you have. This explains why gravity is strong when near an object (e.g. when close to earth), and decreases inversely proportional to square distance from the object. If you imagine an expanding "spherical wave" of space moving inward, surface area of the sphere increases in relation to the square of the distance. However, the effect is dispersed over this increased surface area, hence it decreases with the square of the distance from the object. A fairly simple (but 2D vs. 3D) analogy is how when you throw a stone into water, the ripple will be strong at first, near the entry point, and then the ripple disperses as it expands into the surrounding pond. A good 3D analogy is how sound (or light) expands spherically, and is more faint the further you are away from the source. The orbit of "binary" systems, including the dynamics between the earth and moon. The earth is more massive than the moon, and is absorbing more space than the moon. Therefore, it is moving the moon toward it fairly quickly (but the moon has enough momentum that it remains in orbit vs. falling toward earth). However, the moon is also pulling on the earth, so the earth is also "falling toward the moon" a little. Again, the earth has enough momentum not to "fall into the moon". This results in mostly the moon orbiting around the earth, but the earth is also "slightly" orbiting around the moon, which would be observed as a slight wobble. This explains why large mass objects and small mass objects are affected the same by gravity. Since it is space itself that is moving, whatever is in that space will be moved accordingly. If it is an anvil, it will be moved just the same as a feather. Therefore (if it weren't for other effects such as air resistance), a feather would fall to earth the same speed as an anvil. In practice, air resistance makes the feather small much slower (but repeat the experiment on the moon, and they should hit at the same time since it has no air). This even explains why things without mass (e.g. light) are also affected by gravity. Since space itself is moving, light moves along with it. This would explain gravitational lensing, and why light cannot escape a black hole. 

Well, this radiation is way too small to be detected by itself, even if the black hole would be at our doorstep. However, the radiation makes the black hole less massive and smaller and finally it will vanish, producing a gamma ray flash which we hope is detectable, even from a very large distance. As @JamesK notes in the comments, this evaporation will take extremely long for the 'common' black holes caused by supernovae and those found in galaxy centers, but smaller primordial black holes, formed in the very beginning of the universe, could be evaporating now and that's why we have a telescope looking for those gamma ray flashes. 

Is it moving straight to the west (i.e. it keeps the same distance from the horizon) or does it 'move with the stars'? Have you checked an online planetarium like The Sky Live? Based on the current information, it could just be Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, or even Venus which is currently in her Evenstar period (but planets generally don't twinkle). 

Full answer: a conjunction like this 'nearly' happened on May 5th, 2000. NASA published an article about this event, stating: 

As far as elements (e.g. on the periodic table) go, I would say the odds are very slim. We already discovered or produced all the elements of the Periodic Table up to atomic number 112 at least. As the number increases, the half lives of the elements generally decreases, and is very short for elements above 102. If this trend holds true as the number increases, practically all the "undiscovered" elements should have turned into the lower known atomic number elements. However, there is hope. There is a theorized "island of stability" where a narrow range of yet to be discovered high atomic number elements may be stable: $URL$ I would say there is a slight chance this element could be discovered in the solar system. 

Second part of my theory: I also believe antimatter somehow constantly ejects space back into the universe. I believe when matter and antimatter form, they are somehow "linked" so that space absorbed by matter is ejected by the corresponding antimatter particle. This would give antimatter a "negative" gravity effect. I believe there is equal amounts of matter and antimatter in the universe, and the antimatter is in a diffuse cloud spread throughout the universe, where matter is not present. I believe this accounts for dark energy - the accelerating expansion of the universe. 

As @RobJeffries mentions, you can calculate the difference from the equations which define magnitude and flux. But this particular case is even covered in the Wikipedia article on apparent magnitude: 

This is not really known; while the rotation period of most of the larger satellites is known, and they're mostly synchronized, for the smaller ones it's harder to determine and they're less likely to be synchronized: 

The major axis is just the sum of the distance at perigee plus the distance at apogee. This is 400 km + 1500 km + the diameter (not radius) of the Earth, and the semi-major axis is half of that. However, the semi-minor axis is harder to determine. Therefore, why not use an alternative method to calculate the eccentricity? $$e = \frac{r_a-r_p}{r_a+r_p}$$ Here, the $r$'s are the distance to the center of the Earth, not the apside altitudes. Can you take it from here? 

I'm very sorry for you, but this is just (mathematical) probability at work and no (astronomical) pattern. I'm on mobile right now so I can't do a full analysis, but note that if you divide Mercury's period (3520.2) by 89 instead of 88, the result is 39.55. Still pretty close to 39.88. In other words, the larger the numbers get, the easier is to find a 'divisor' close to 39.88. 

What is gravity? I want to know more than it being simply the "mysterious force" that attracts things to earth. Is it a particle, a wave, or something else entirely? 

I remember one time a while back looking at the night sky through night vision goggles. One interesting thing I noticed is that there appeared to be many very faint meteors in the sky practically all the time. I assume this is dust burning up in the atmosphere, or possibly an unusual effect produced by the night vision goggles themselves. I more suspect that it is dust burning faintly in the atmosphere because it was seen only in the sky. My main question is: Is space dust constantly entering the atmosphere as small meteors at a fairly high rate? If I remember right, it was a few every second, which is much more frequent than normal "brighter" meteors, even during a meteor shower. 

Is there any known pair of objects tidally locked with each other? I know the moon is tidally locked with the earth (e.g. one side always facing earth), but I don't know of any pair of objects that are both tidally locked with each other. For example, the planet would be tidally locked with the moon, and the moon would be tidally locked with the planet. 

As discussed here, the path of the Sun resembles a sine wave (see the image below), with a (semi-)amplitude equal to the axial tilt of the Earth, usually denoted $\varepsilon$, about 23.4 degrees. A simple formula, which might be accurate for your purposes, is the following: if $a$ denotes the right ascension (in hours), the declination $\delta$ is given by the following formula: $$\delta = \varepsilon \sin(2\pi\frac{a}{24h})$$ The actual formula is more complicated. From the formulas linked to by @barrycarter: $$\alpha = \arctan(\cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda)$$ $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \sin\lambda)$$ we obtain $$\tan\alpha = \cos\varepsilon \tan\lambda$$ $$\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon} = \tan\lambda$$ so $$\lambda = \arctan\frac{\tan\alpha}{\cos\varepsilon}$$ Plugging this into the declination formula, and using the fact that $\sin(\arctan(x)) = \frac{x}{\pm\sqrt{x^2+1}}$, we get $$\delta = \arcsin(\sin\varepsilon \frac{\tan\alpha}{\pm\sqrt{\tan^2\alpha+\cos^2\varepsilon}})$$ (here the right ascension $\alpha$ is measured in radians or degrees, not hours). 

Phone cameras just aren't designed to take good photographs of astronomical objects. The sensor is too small and the configuration options (like exposure time) are minimal. For astronomical photography, a better option is to use (the body of) a DSLR (or the analog version); the lens is provided by your telescope. Another option is a specialized CCD camera.
