I'd like to follow this up with a seemingly related question. In my book "Topology and groupoids" (2006) there is a whole Chapter 11 on Orbit Spaces, Orbit Groupoids, giving joint work with P.J. Higgins showing that for discontinuous actions of a discrete group on a Hausdorff space which has a universal cover, the fundamental groupoid of the orbit space is the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid. One application is given there, namely computing the fundamental group of the symmetric square of a space $X$ (it is the fundamental group of $X$ made abelian, which of course is known through other routes). A question arising from this work is whether there are applications of these methods to braid groups, and configuration spaces. I'd like to see a really novel application! 

My analogy for an explanation relates it to explaining the way to the station: you describe the general landscape on the way, not every crack in the pavement. You are assuming a certain known structure, or type of structure. (Such as: turn left at the traffic lights, then right at the Post office.) You do draw attention to any major holes in the path. In mathematics we often have to invent the structures which make the ideas clear. I heard Raoul Bott in 1958 say of Grothendieck that he was prepared to work very hard to make a proof tautological. Grothendieck was very keen on understanding the underlying processes and forms. One importance of this is for computational help: we would like computers to deal with the various hierarchical levels in mathematical practice, and not to have to search for a proof using a low level of structure. 

I think there are several different ways to make intuitive sense of this, so I'll have a bit of a go at each of them, and hope you find it helpful. First explanation: At the global level for similarity maps. Let $M$ be a manifold, and consider a conformal map $f\colon M\to M$. (By conformal we mean that $Df_x$ is a scalar multiple of an isometry.) The simplest case to consider is the one where $\|Df_x\|$ is constant everywhere, say $\|Df_x\| = e^\lambda$ for some $\lambda > 0$; for example, let's consider the case where $M$ is the $n$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{R}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $f(x)=e^\lambda x$. In this case, $\lambda$ is the Lyapunov exponent of every point in $M$, and you can easily check that if $B(x,n,\delta)$ is the Bowen ball of radius $\delta$ and order $n$, then $B(x,n,\delta) = B(x,\delta e^{-\lambda n})$. The metric balls $B(x,\delta e^{-\lambda n})$ are used in the definition of Hausdorff dimension, while the Bowen balls $B(x,n,\delta)$ are used in the definition of entropy. If instead of the classical definition of entropy one uses Bowen's definition as a Caratheodory dimension characteristic (see Pesin's book, for example), then the definition of entropy is a verbatim transcription of the definition of Hausdorff dimension, with Bowen balls replacing metric balls. In particular, it is pretty straightforward to see that $$ \text{Hausdorff dimension} = \frac{\text{topological entropy}}{\text{Lyapunov exponent}}. \qquad \qquad \text{(1)} $$ At some level, everything else is just a fancy generalisation of (1). Indeed, in the case mentioned, the potential $\log \|Df_x\|$ is equal to $\lambda$ everywhere, and so the pressure function is given by $$ P_\Lambda (-t\log \|Df_x) = h_\mathrm{top}(\Lambda, f) - t \lambda $$ using basic properties of pressure. The unique root of this equation is $t=h_\mathrm{top}(\Lambda, f) / \lambda$, which by (1) is exactly the Hausdorff dimension. Second explanation: At the local level for arbitrary maps. Now consider an arbitrary conformal map, so $\|Df_x\|$ may vary from point to point. One way of computing both Hausdorff dimension and topological entropy/pressure is by using (invariant) measures, so let $\mu$ be an invariant measure. Then if you know something about the pointwise dimensions and local entropies of $\mu$, you can use that knowledge to calculate (or at least estimate) global dimensional quantities like Hausdorff dimension, entropy, and pressure. But at the local level, subject to some bounded distortion estimates, it's not too difficult to show that $$ d_\mu(x) = \frac{h_\mu(x)}{\lambda(x)}; $$ that is, that $$ \text{pointwise dimension} = \frac{\text{local entropy}}{\text{Lyapunov exponent}}, $$ a nice counterpart to (1) in this more general setting. Third explanation: As a generalisation of Moran's equation. If you build a Cantor set on the interval (or indeed, in $\mathbb{R}^n$) by using $k$ basic sets at every stage of the construction, each of which is scaled down by a factor of $\lambda_k$ from the basic set at the previous stage that contains it, then Moran's theorem says that the Hausdorff dimension of the resulting Cantor set is the unique value of $t$ such that $$ \lambda_1^t + \cdots + \lambda_k^t = 1. \qquad \qquad \text{(2)} $$ If you take the log of both sides, you get a special case of Bowen's equation. Probably the easiest case to see this in is when $k=2$ and $\lambda=1/3$; then the unique solution of (2) is $t=\log 2/\log 3$, as expected. So one can think of Bowen's equation as the natural generalisation of Moran's equation to the setting where the ratio coefficients can vary at each stage of the construction of a Cantor set. References: We included a discussion and proof of Moran's Theorem in chapter 2 of Lectures on Fractal Geometry and Dynamical Systems, by Yakov Pesin and Vaughn Climenhaga, and the relationship (1) and its siblings appear in various places in the first four chapters of that book. And if it's not too gauche to continue to refer to my own work, I'll point out that "Bowen's equation in the non-uniform setting", which is here on the arXiv, contains some more precise and detailed formulations of a bunch of the things I said above. 

Let $k=\mathbb{F}_q$ where $q$ is a prime power of odd cardinality. Where could I find explicit models of all irreducible cuspidal (complex) representations of $GL_n(k)$ for $n\ge 3$? I understand that the characters of such representations was constructed by J.A. Green “The characters of the finite general linear groups,” Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.,80, No. 2, 402–447 (1955). If $n=2$, the cuspidal representations of $GL_2(k)$ can be constructed using Weil representations, which can be found in many online notes. But I could not find any explicit construction of cuspidal representations of $GL_n(k)$ when $n\ge 3$. 

Let $G$ be a reductive group defined over a field $F$. Let $\Sigma$ be the set of roots of $G$ with respect to a Borel subgroup $B=TU$ with torus $T$. Let $W=N_G(T)/T$ be the Weyl group of $G$. For $\alpha\in \Sigma$, let $U_\alpha$ be the root space of $\alpha$. Denote $x_\alpha:F\rightarrow U_\alpha$ the fixed isomorphism. Let $\alpha\in \Sigma$ be a root, and $w\in W$ be a Weyl element such that $w(\alpha)=\alpha$. My question is: is it true that $w$ has a representative $\dot w\in G$ such that $$\dot w x_\alpha(r)\dot w^{-1}=x_\alpha(r),\forall r\in F?$$ If this is false in general, in what cases it is true? Thanks in advance. 

the endpoints of $I$ are fixed by every map in $\mathcal{C}$; the maps in $\mathcal{C}$ are strictly increasing; $\mathcal{C}$ is closed under composition; every positive real number appears exactly once as the ratio of the derivatives of $\mathcal{C}$ at the right and left endpoints of $I$. 

If I remember my infinite ergodic theory correctly, any measure-preserving transformation $T$ of a $\sigma$-finite measure space $(\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ leads to a decomposition of $\Omega$ into a dissipative part $\Omega_d$ and a conservative part $\Omega_c$. (This notation is probably non-standard.) The dissipative part is the union of the wandering sets for $T$, where a set $E$ is wandering if it is disjoint from all its preimages $T^{-n}(E)$, $n\geq 0$. The conservative part is thee complement of the dissipative part. On the dissipative part, everything "goes to infinity" in some sense (eventually leaves $\Omega_k$, for instance), while on the conservative part, the Poincare recurrence theorem holds. (Conservative measures are exactly those $\sigma$-finite measures for which the Poincare recurrence theorem still works.) I believe this establishes the dichotomy you want. This may even work for transformations that don't preserve $\mu$, but only preserve the collection of null sets. I'd check a reference on that, though -- details of all of this are in Aaronson's book An Introduction to Infinite Ergodic Theory. 

You could look at P.R. Heath, Groupoid operations and fibre homotopy equivalences, Math Z. 130 (1973) 207-233. There is also a II, and a set of lecture notes by him on the area. 

Following on from Dimitri's answer, I first came across covering morphisms of groupoids in the paper Higgins, P.J. "Presentations of groupoids, with applications to groups". Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. \60 (1964) 7--20. and they are well presented in his book Categories and groupoids. In fact they appeared earlier in the paper Smith, P.A. "The complex of a group relative to a set of generators. I". Ann. of Math. (2) 54 (1951) 371--402. under the name "regular morphism". One way of expounding the theory of covering spaces of a space $X$ is to give conditions on $X$ so that a particular covering morphism of groupoids $p: G \to \pi_1 X$ is determined by a covering map $q:Y \to X$ where $Y$ is a topologized $Ob(G)$. March 9: I add that the category of covering morphisms of the groupoid $G$ is equivalent to the category of actions of $G$ on sets; so one can chose which of these you find best for a particular use or applications. Since 1967, I have liked modelling a covering map by a covering morphism, as was done for simplicial maps by Gabriel and Zisman. You an find a full treatment of covering space theory using covering morphisms of groupoids in the book Topology and Groupoids, which extends somewhat the treatment in the 1968 edition. 

Let $E/F$ be a quadratic field extension of p-adic fields. Let $V$ be a (skew-)Hermitian space and $U(V)$ be the unitary group. Let $GU(V)$ be the similitude unitary group. Given an irreducible smooth representation $\pi$ of $GU(V)$, do we know that the restriction $\pi|_{U(V)}$ has multiplicity one? For the pair $(GL(n),SL(n))$ similar results are proved by Tadic. For the pair $(GSp, Sp)$, similar results are proved by Adler-Prasad. I am wondering if the unitary group version is true or not. Thanks. 

In section 10 of Gan-Gross-Prasad's paper "Symplectic local root numbers, central critical L-values, and restriction problems in the representation theory of classical groups" $URL$ the authors stated that the full local Langlands conjectures for some small ranked classical groups are known, but no reference is given. Can anybody point out a reference for the SO(4) and SO(6) case? Do we know whether the local Langlands map preserves certain local epsilon or L-factors? Added: I appreciated the answer provided by Professor Kimball, which is very helpful. I do want to know more details about (split) SO(4). In the last section of Gross-Prasad's paper as given by Kimball, there is an exact sequence $$0\rightarrow SO_4(k)\rightarrow GL_2(k)\times GL_2(k)/\Delta k^* \rightarrow k^* \rightarrow 0.$$ To get the local Langlands conjecture for SO(4) from that of GL(2) from this exact sequence, it seems that we need to know the relationship between irreducible admissible representations of SO(4) and irreducible admissible representations of $GL_2(k)\times GL_2(k)/\Delta k^*$. Is this something standard or even trivial? On the other hand, in GGP, the authors stated that most local Langlands conjecture for classical groups should be established by the (forthcoming) book of Arthur and Moglin's papers. Arthur's books has already come out $URL$ . I never tried to read Arthur's book. What I would like to know is: whether they (Arthur and Moglin) proved the preservation of local epsilon and L-factors, or they just proved the existence of the local Langlands map. 

It might be useful here to make the translation between the arguments using covering spaces and those using the Grothendieck construction by noting that there is a well known equivalence for a groupoid $G$ between the category of actions of $G$ on sets and that of covering morphisms of the groupoid $G$. See for example Higgins, P.J., Notes on categories and groupoids, Mathematical Studies, Volume 32. Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. London (1971); Reprints in Theory and Applications of Categories, No. 7 (2005) pp 1-195. (downloadable) I have traced this notion of covering morphism back to a 1951 Annals. of Math. paper by P.A. Smith (under the name regular morphism), and the equivalence mentioned above is of course related to the so-called Grothendieck construction, though is was earlier considered by C. Ehresmann. I believe there are advantages in an exposition of covering spaces using this notion, since a covering map is nicely modelled by a covering morphism. 

Just to add a bit to the history, the first time the exponential law was given for Hausdorff k-spaces was I believe in my DPhil thesis, submitted 1961, see PtA available here, which was circulated to the obvious places. In my first paper, (1963), also available here, I wrote: "It may be that the category of Hausdorff k-spaces is adequate and convenient for all purposes of topology." In my second paper, (1964), I used the category of Hausdorff spaces and functions continuous on compact subsets, and showed it was what we now called cartesian closed. (My thesis contains an attempt at showing the idea of what we now call monoidal closed, since in my thesis I had lots of internal homs and associated products, usually a tensor.) I did not understand final topologies at the time and so did not come up with the definition for the non Hausdorff case, but you can find that in my book Topology and Groupoids. Several people wrote about the non Hausdorff case, but an important application is to fibred exponential laws which were developed by Peter Booth following some ideas sketched by R. Thom. See Booth, Peter I. The section problem and the lifting problem. Math. Z. 121 (1971), 273–287. I also wonder whether the category defined in Johnstone, P. T. On a topological topos. Proc. London Math. Soc. (3) 38 (1979), no. 2, 237–271. is indeed adequate and convenient for all purposes of topology, in particular can cope well with fibred exponential laws, since being a topos is a stronger condition. There are also the purposes of analysis, for which see Kriegl, Andreas; Michor, Peter W. The convenient setting of global analysis. Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 53. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 1997. So the term "convenient" has had a good run! 

$x_{n+1} = a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}$. Then you move to $(i+1,j+1)$, and the edge connecting the two vertices is labeled with this common value $a_{i+1} = b_{j+1}$. $x_{n+1} = a_{i+1} < b_{j+1}$. Then the last $i+1$ symbols of $x_1\cdots x_{n+1}$ are the first $i+1$ symbols of $a$, but $x_1\cdots x_{n+1}$ doesn't end with any initial segment of $b$, so you move to $(i+1,0)$. Thus you get an edge from $(i,j)\to(i+1,0)$ labeled with $a_{i+1}$. $x_{n+1} = b_{j+1} > a_{i+1}$. As in the previous case, you get an edge $(i,j)\to (0,j+1)$ labeled with $b_{j+1}$. $a_{i+1} < x_{n+1} < b_{j+1}$. Then $x_1\cdots x_{n+1}$ doesn't end with any initial segment of either $a$ or $b$, so you're back to $(0,0)$. Thus you get an edge from $(i,j) \to (0,0)$ labeled with $x_{n+1}$. 

I expect that there's a general result along these lines, and that it is quite standard and well-known. But I don't know it (and I'd rather re-invent the wheel as few times as possible). Can someone help me out with a statement of a general theorem, and ideally a reference? Edit: Since that was kind of rambling, here's the specific question. Let $B(r)$ denote the (open) ball of radius $r$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ centred at the origin. Suppose $f\colon B(\delta) \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image, and suppose $\overline{f(B(\delta))} \subset B(\epsilon)$. Let $\delta' < \delta$. Does there necessarily exist a diffeomorphism $F\colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ that agrees with $f$ on $B(\delta')$ and is the identity map outside of $B(\epsilon)$? I think we need to require that $Df(0)$ have positive determinant. Are there any other obstructions? If there are, can they be removed (for a given $f$) by decreasing $\delta$ so that $f$ is close to being a linear map? Is there a general theorem from which all this follows? 

The examples given are part of the case for homotopy colimits. For example the pushout of the two maps $$S^1 \leftarrow S^1 \to S^!$$ given by $z\mapsto z^2, z \mapsto z^3$ is not Hausdorff. But the double mapping cylinder $M$ is a nice CW-complex. Amusingly, this is rel;ated to the case for groupoids, where the pushout in groups of the two maps $$ \mathbb Z \leftarrow \mathbb Z \to \mathbb Z$$ is the trefoil group $T$ with generators $x,y$ and relation $x^2=y^3$, but the homotopy pushout in groupoids is the "trefoil groupoid", say $T'$, with two objects $0,1$, generators $x,y$ at $0,1$ respectively and one arrow $\iota :0 \to 1$ conjugating $x^2$ to $y^3$. The advantage of this is that it "separates" the two group generators $x,y$, and of course $T'$ is the fundamental groupoid of $M$ on two base points, one at each end of the cylinder. 

You might like to see the argument in What should be the context of an adequate specialist undergraduate education in mathematics?, Ronnie Brown and Tim Porter, The De Morgan Journal 2 no. 1, (2012) 411--67. $URL$ and the comments that followed. Here we argue against the concentration on content, without any discussion about mathematics. For more discussion on such teaching questions, see also my web page $URL$ Some of our students rated our course on "Mathematics in context" as the best of our courses. Students had to write a project under the terms of that title; we were totally surprised by the initiative of the students and the variety of topics chosen; some also said that the writing helped them to come to terms with their own attitude towards mathematics. 

In their paper "Uniqueness of linear periods", Compositio Mathematica, $\textbf{102}$ (1996), 65-123, Jacquet and Rallis asked the following question in the middle of page 67. Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field, and $n$ be a positive integer. Let $H_0=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&\\ &a \end{pmatrix},a\in GL_n(F)\right\}\subset GL_{2n}(F)$. Given an irreducible smooth representation of $GL_{2n}(F)$, if $\textrm{Hom}_{H_0}(\pi,1)\ne 0$, could we conclude that $\pi$ is self-contragredient? If $n=1$, it is well-known that the answer is yes. How about the general case? What is the current status of this problem? 

Following Bernstein-Zelevinski, an $\ell$-space is a Hausdorff, locally compact totally disconnected topological space. For an $\ell$-space $X$, denote $S(X)$ the space of Bruhat-Schwartz functions on $X$, i.e., the space of $\mathbb{C}$-valued locally constant, compact supported functions on $X$. A distribution on $X$ is defined to be an element in $\textrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}(S(X),\mathbb{C})$. Denote by $S^*(X)$ the space of distributions on $X$. Let $G$ be an $\ell$-group which acts on $X$. Then $G$ acts on $S(X)$ as $(g.f)(x)=f(g^{-1}.x),g\in G,f\in S(X), x\in X$. This induces an action of $G$ on the distributions: $(g.T)(f)=T(g^{-1}.f)$. A distribution $T$ is called $G$-invariant if $g.T=T$ for all $g\in G$. Denote by $S^*(X)^G$ the space of $G$-invariant distributions on $X$. Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field. $\textbf{Question 1}$: Let $G=F^\times \times F^\times$ and $X=F^3-\{(0,0,0)\}$. Let $U=(F^\times)^3$ which is an open subset of $X$. Let $G$ act on $X$ by $(a,b).(x,y,z)=(ax,by,abz)$. Is there a $G$-invariant distribution on $X$ such that its restriction to $U$ is non-trivial? If such $T$ exists, what can we say about $Supp(T|_U)$? $\textbf{Question 1'}$: Let $G,X,U$ be as in $\textbf{Question 1}$. Let $\mu=\psi(z/(xy))d^*xd^*yd^*z$, viewed as a distribution on $U$. Here $\psi$ is an additive character of $F$. Is there a $G$-invariant distribution $T$ on $X$ such that $T|_U=\mu$? Here is one example in my mind that suggests the non-existence of distributions $T$ in Question 1. Consider the multiplicative action of $F^\times$ on $F$, and let $U=F^\times$, which is an open subset of $F$. Then by Tate's thesis, there is no $F^\times$-invariant distribution $T$ on $F$ such that $T|_U$ is non-zero. In fact, the only $F^\times$-invariant distribution on $F$ is the Dirac measure. But if we consider the action $(a,b).(x,y,z)=(ax,by,a^{-1}b^{-1}z)$ in $\textbf{Question 1}$, there clearly exists $G$-invariant distribution on $X$ (even on $F^3$, say the usual Haar measure $dxdydz$ on $F^3$) such that its restriction to $U$ is non-trivial. Here are some thoughts on Question 1. Let $Z=X-U$. Then there is an exact sequence $$0\rightarrow S^*(Z)^G\rightarrow S^*(X)^G\rightarrow S^*(U)^G$$ Let's take an element $T_0\in S^*(U)^G$ and asks the question: is it possible to extend $T_0$ to a distribution on $X$? Given a function $\phi\in S(F)$, we can define a distribution $T_0$ on $U$ by $$<T_0,f>=\int_U f(x,y,z)\phi(z/(xy))d^*xd^*yd^*z, f\in S(U).$$ But it seems that there is no obvious way to extend $T_0$ to $X$. For example, if $f\in S(X)$, the integral $ \int_U f(x,y,z)\phi(z/(xy))d^*xd^*yd^*z$ is not well-defined in general, even when $\phi$ has compact support. But I don't know how to characterize $S^*(U)^G$ in general, and I also don't know how to show the above $T_0$ cannot be extended to a $G$-invariant distribution on $X$. Any thoughts or suggestions? Thanks in advance. I asked part of the question here $URL$ but did not draw much attention, and thus I decided to move it here. If it is not permitted, I will delete one.
