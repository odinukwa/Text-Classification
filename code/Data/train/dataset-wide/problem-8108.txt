That is to say, can one find a good bound on $|\pi_i(S^n)|$? Let us assume that $i\ge 2n$ to avoid all infinite quantities. Particularly, I am interested to see if there is a bound of exponential type. I do not see a way to do this though. 

Sorry if this question is to naive or badly phrased. I am curious about the following problem, given a manifold $M$, how "close" can we find a smooth or PL manifold, $N$, with a map $f:N\to M$. The manifolds in this case would preferably be closed compact and of the same dimension. Close in this case is given by $(f)_q=\sum_i Coker(f|_{H_i(M)})q^{i}$, where $q$ is arbitrary but fixed. In the case of $M$ admitting such a structure it is zero, but I'm unable to establish more substantive results. If the manifold is of dimension five for example, I thinking passing to a covering space will allow us to kill the fundamental group, and thus the degree 4 cohomology, which allows us to kill the Kirby-Siberman class. So there is abound of $dim(H^4(M))q$. I'm also interested in the case of $f:M\to N$ with the cokernal replaced with the kernel, but it seems less amenable. 

The second claim is false, I believe. Take the multisets $\{1, -1, 1\}$ and $\{1, -1, -1\}$. Then we obtain $\Lambda^{odd}=\{1, -1, 1, -1\}=\{1, -1, -1, 1\}$ and $\Lambda^{even}=\{-1, -1, 1\}=\{-1, 1, -1\}$ 

I apologize if this question is obvious as I am just beginning to learn this field. I am also abusing the dependance on $p$ for notational ease. The Chromatic Convergence theorem establishes that $S=\mathrm{holim}_{n}L_{E(n)}S$. This gives that the maps $f_n^m:\pi_m(S)\to \pi_m(L_{E(n)}S)$ contain all the homotopy groups, atleast for $n>>0$. The groups on the left are finite (for all the ones that matter), and so they will be seen in $\pi_m(L_{E(n)}S)$ after some finite $n$, so that our localization is $m$-connected after some finite $n$. My question is, what are the lower bounds on this number? That is, do we have information on how quickly the chromatic tower will give us all the homotopy information above a certain index? 

There is a finer approach to the dimension of the quotient when the action of $G$ on $M$ doesn't define a fibration, but has singular orbits. You'll find it here. Of course for the principal orbit you have your formula, but on singular orbits it gives something else. I didn't give a general formula (I should do it however) but I treated the examples $\Delta_n = {\bf R}^n/{\rm SO}(n)$. Topologically, for any $n$ these quotients are homeomorphic to the half line $[0,\infty[$, but not diffeologically, and if we have well (according to your formula) ${\rm dim}_x(\Delta_n) = 1$ for $x \neq 0$, we have however ${\rm dim}_0(\Delta_n) = n$; which proves by the way, that for 2 different quotients, if they are homeomorphic, they are not diffeomorphic. I'm not sure it will help you very much, because it seems that you are interested only in the principal orbits, but your question was too tempting to not underline this construction. 

I learned geometric quantization from Jean-Marie Souriau — one of the initiators of the subject with Bertram Kostant — in two texts essentially: 

Addendum: I am not sure that the process of simplification can help in anything. But I'll try to clarify what I have in mind. Imagine that the bold black curve is the path of minimal length (I didn't draw the ambient polygon). You go from $a$ to $b$ etc. The point $b$ is the first point of "inflection", means that the turning changes sign. If you don't touch the first and last segments on $(a,b)$ you will not change the total turning angle on this piece of path. You have then (on the picture) the choice of three simplifications (thin lines marked with circles at rupture points), two of them gain 1 segment count, and the other one gains 2. If some of them fit in the ambient polygon, it's fine, and you continue that way, on the next part, until the next inflection point. You would like to simplify also by shortcutting along the green dashed line, but you cant since the bold curve is assumed to be the shortest, it must be an obstacle there. So, this way starting with a short curve you may improve the straightness. As I am really not an expert on this kind of geometry, I am not sure this way leads somewhere. It seems that there is still a long way from here to a proof of the existence of what you are looking for. 

For the second question, maybe it suffices to assume that the curvature tensor is $C^k$ (or $C^{k,\alpha}$ to use the elliptic theory). Then one may prove the existence of harmonic coordinates, in which $g_{ij}$ is in $C^{k+2,\alpha}$. The next step is to study the modified Ricci flow (by Deturk's trick), the usual parabolic theory implies that $g_{ij}$ is in parabolic $C^{k+2,\alpha}$ and hence the curvature tensor is bounded in $C^k$. The existence of harmonic coordinates is only local, however i don't know how to use Deturk' trick locally. So the above argument contains some gap. 

The book by Robert A. Adams has a 'ultimate' theorem about: trace theorem (resctricting to lower dimensions), extension theorem (extending to higher dimensions) and sobolev embedding. It is Theorem 7.58. It is definitely more than you need here. It involves even fractional order Sobolev spaces. The theorem is about Euclidean spaces. If you want a manifold version, we can always do it by hand. (Or just by waving your hand, especially when you are not really interested in controlling the constant.) Chop the manifold into pieces near the boundary and consider a coordinate system mapping a neighborhood to (a domain of ) half space, then use the partition of unity. The constant in your final inequality depends on a uniform bound of the coordinate system. Sorry, I can not be very precise here. However, the method works. 

Let's consider a linear functional $A$ from smooth objects to smooth ones. It is first order operator in the sense that it extends to be a map from $W^{k+1,p}$ to $W^{k,p}$. Assume that we have $L^2$ inner product defined. My question is (1) the adjoint $A^*$ is still a map from smooth objects to smooth objects and extends to the a map from $W^{k,p}$ to $W^{k-1,p}$. (2) When is $A^*\circ A$ invertible as a map from $W^{k+1,p}$ to $W^{k-1,p}$? The condition i have in mind is the injectivity of $A$. (3) Can we obtain some estimate for the inverse? We don't have explicit formula for $A$. So please try to answer these question in the framework of functional analysis. The background of this question is that I try to generalize some obvious facts in finite dimensional geometry to Banach space.
