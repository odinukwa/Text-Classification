This is too long for a comment. For your stated goal it suffices to define the boundary as manifold's boundary (i.e., it is empty for a submanifold as defined in your first paragraph). Then you'll have $\partial(B'\cap N)\subset\partial B'$ automatically. However I suspect that the notion you are seeking is "properly embedded submanifold": a submanifold $N$ of $M$ is properly embedded if the inclusion map $i:N\to M$ is proper (a map is called proper if the pre-image of every compact set is compact). In the case when $M$ is an open ball $B$ the intuitive meaning of this is that all ends of $M$ accumulate at the boundary of $B$. This property also implies that the boundary of $N$ as a current (if it is one) is supported in the boundary of $B$. 

No, even if $X=\mathbb R^2$. Let $A_1$ be (the convex hull of) 4 points with coordinates $(\pm 1,\pm 1)$. Then $m(A_1)=(0,0)$, as the 4 points are on the circle $S_1$ of radius $\sqrt 2$ centered at $(0,0)$. Shift $S_1$ a small distance $\varepsilon$ in the horizontal direction, denote the resulting circle by $S_2$. For each vertex of $A_1$, mark its nearest point on $S_2$. The marked points are vertices of a convex quadrangle $A_2$ inscribed in $S_2$ and containing its center $(\varepsilon,0)$. Hence $m(A_2)=(\varepsilon,0)$ but the Hausdorff distance between $A_1$ and $A_2$ is $\approx\varepsilon/\sqrt 2$. 

Being far from analysis, I recently learned about the Invariant subspace problem and came up with the following (perhaps simple or well-known) question. Let $H$ be a separable complex Hilbert space and $T:H\to H$ a bounded operator. Assume that the spectrum of $H$ is $\{0\}$, i.e. $T-\lambda I$ has a bounded inverse for every $\lambda\in\mathbb C\setminus\{0\}$. In finite dimensions, this would imply that $T$ is nilpotent ($T^n=0$ for some $n$). I wonder if there is something similar in the infinite dimensional case. The precise formulation I have in mind is the following. It is easy to see that there is a maximal subspace $X\subset H$ such that $T(X)=X$. This is a purely set-theoretic fact, a sort of explicit construction is the intersection of the images of iterations of $T$ up to and beyond infinity (via transfinite induction). Question: can it happen that $X\ne\{0\}$? Here are some observations that I made: 

Here is an explicit (and short) version of Anton Geraschenko's answer. Let $G$ act on a regular $(n-1)$-dimensional simplex $\Delta$ permuting its vertices as in Cayley's theorem ($n$ in the order of $G$). Let $p_0,\dots,p_{n-1}$ be the vertices of this simplex. Cut off a small simplex $\Delta'$ (located near $p_0$) constructed as follows: for $k=1,\dots,n-1$, let $p'_k$ be the point on the edge $[p_0p_k]$ at the distance $k\varepsilon$ from $p_0$, where $\varepsilon=1/100n$. The simplex $\Delta'$ is the convex hull of $p_0,p'_1,\dots,p'_{n-1}$, you cut is off from $\Delta$ by the hyperplane through points $p'_1,\dots,p'_{n-1}$. Also, cut off all images of $\Delta'$ under the action of $G$. The resulting polytope does not have any extra symmetries, so $G$ is its group of self-isometries. 

This cardinality is always finite, for any compact locally simply connected metric space. If there were infinitely many non-homotopic curves of length $\le L$, they would have a converging subsequence (by Arzela-Ascoli). In a locally simply connected space, any two sufficiently close curves are homotopic, so curves in the sequence are eventually homotopic to their limit, a contradiction. 

There are no continuous solutions. Since the cosine has a unique fixed point $x_0$ (such that $\cos x_0=x_0$), it should be a fixed point of f. And f should be injective and hence monotone (increasing or decreasing) in a neighborhood of $x_0$. Then f(f(x)) is increasing in a (possibly smaller) neighborhood of $x_0$ while the cosine is not. As for discontinuous ones, there are terribly many of them ($2^{\mathbb R}$) and you probably cannot parametrize them in any reasonable way. You can describe them in terms of orbits of iterations of $\cos x$, but I doubt this would count as a solution of the equation. UPDATE: Here is how to construct a solution (this is technical and I might overlook something). Let X be an infinite set and $g:X\to X$ is a map, I am looking for a sufficient conditions for the existence of a solution of $f\circ f=g$. Define the following equivalence relation on X: x and y are equivalent iff $g^n(x)=g^m(y)$ for some positive integers m and n. Equivalence classes will be referred to as orbits (the term is wrong but I don't know what is a correct one). Two orbits are said to be similar is there is a bijection between them commuting with g. If Y and Z are two similar orbits, one can define f on $Y\cup Z$ as follows: on Y, f is that bijection to Z, and on Z, f is the inverse bijection composed with g. So if the orbits can be split into pairs of similar ones, we have a desired f. Now remove from the real line the fixed point of cos and all its roots ($\pi/2$ and the like). Then, if I am not missing something, in the remaining set X all orbits of cos are similar, so we can define f as above. Define f so that 0 has a nonempty pre-image (that is, the orbit containing 0 should be used as Z and not as Y). Finally. map the fixed point of cos to itself, and the roots of cos to some pre-image of 0. 

Let me throw in some speculations based on my limited involvement in dynamical systems. The conjugation formula $f=h^{-1}gh$ is in general not a type of a functional equation that can be solved by iterative approximations or a clever fixed-point trick. The problem is that you cannot determine how badly a particular $h$ fails by looking at the difference between LHS and RHS of this equation. The obstructions are not local and you don't see them until you consider all iterations of $f$ and $g$. Sometimes you can do approximations (e.g. Anosov system more or less survive under perturbations) but this works only in special types of systems (some kind of "hyperbolicity" is needed). It seems that the only "general" way for constructing a topological conjugation is to study the orbits of $f$ and $g$ and send each orbit of $f$ to a similar orbit of $g$ so that the whole map is continuous. (A dense set of orbits is sufficient, e.g. the set of periodic points of an Anosov system.) The problem is, of course, that the structure of orbits can be really complicated. But if it is simple, one can hope to construct a conjugation directly. For example, consider two homeomorphisms $f,g:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ satisfying $f(x)>x$ and $g(x)>x$ for all $x$. They are conjugate. To see this, consider an orbit $\dots,x_{-1},x_0,x_1,x_2,\dots$ of a point $x_0$ under the iterations of $f$. This is an increasing sequence and the intervals $[x_i,x_{i+1}]$ cover $\mathbb R$. Every other orbit "interleaves" with this one: for example, if $y_0\in(x_0,x_1)$, then $y_i:=f^i(y_0)$ lies between $x_i$ and $x_{i+1}$. So every orbit has a unique member in the interval $[x_0,x_1)$. In a sense, this interval (or rather the closed one with the endpoints glued together) naturally represents the set of all orbits. So take any orbit $(x_i')$ of $g$ and let $h_0$ be any order-preserving bijection from $[x_0,x_1]$ to $[x_0',x_1']$. This defines a unique conjugacy map $h:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$ such that $h|_{[x_0,x_1]}=h_0$: the orbit $\{f^i(y)\}$ of a point $y\in [x_0,x_1]$ is mapped to the $g$-orbit $\{g^i(h_0(y))\}$ of the point $h_0(y)$. And all conjugations can be obtained this way. Already in this simple example, you can see how fragile things can be. Even if $f$ and $g$ are smooth and have bounded derivatives, you have no control over how big the derivatives of $h$ can grow. (And you actually lose smoothness if you do the same on a closed interval rather than $\mathbb R$.) If you vary the map $g$, it remains conjugate to $f$ while the condition $g(x)>x$ holds true. But it suddenly stops being conjugate once a fixed point appears. However trivial this fact is, is shows that limit of conjugacy maps does not make sense in general. The exercise you mention can be solved in a similar fashion as my toy example; the orbits are not much more complicated. In fact, given any two homeomorphisms $\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, it is easy to understand whether they are conjugate or not (just study the intervals between fixed points). But the next step - homeomorphisms of the circle - is much more difficult: there are beautiful theorems, unexpected conterexamples, connections to number theory and other signs of a rich theory around such a seemingly trivial object. See Denjoy theorem and especially its smoothness requirements to get an idea how interesting these things can be. 

The answer is no in the symplectic case. I believe there are $X$ and $Y$ such that $\phi_X\circ\phi_Y$ is not generated by any time-independent Hamiltonian flow but I can't produce an example. However I can prove that $\phi_X\circ\phi_Y$ is not generated by a flow defined by a local formula. Consider the cylinder $S^1\times [0,1]$ and close up its ends to make a sphere. The first field $Y$ rotates the thing along the $S^1$ factor, say, with angular velocity $\sqrt 2$. The second field $X$ is supported is a small round disc $D$ inside the cylinder, and it rotates this disc around its center (with angular velocity decaying to 0 at the boundary). Let $f=\phi_X\circ\phi_Y$ and suppose it is a time 1 map of a time-independent Hamiltonian flow. Since the sphere is simply connected, there is a globally defined Hamiltonian $H$, and the orbits of the flow are its level curves. Suppose also that the flow field is given by a local formula in terms of $X$ and $Y$. Outside $D$, we have $X=0$, so the formula yields $Y$. This implies that the orbits contain large pieces of the original circles (namely part of the circles outside $D$). Consider such an interval $s$ of the circle through the center of $D$. The image $f(s)$ must be within the same orbit. But $f(s)$ intersects $s$ transversally at some point outside $U$. Moving along $Y$ shows that the orbit contains an open region, a contradiction. 

You cannot recover a convex polytope from its projection areas, even if you know the whole function (unit vector) $\mapsto$ (area of projection along this vector). There exist two different polytopes $P_1$ and $P_2$ such that for every unit vector $v\in\mathbb R^3$, the areas of the two projections along $v$ are equal. Let me begin with a two-dimensional example. In this case, the projections are one-dimensional, and the "projection area" is width. Consider a regular triangle $T$ with side 1 and regular hexagon $H$ with side 1/2, positioned so that their sides are parallel. Their widths are the same in every direction. One can prove this without computation: the hexagon is the Minkowski symmetrization of the triangle and the symmetrization preserves widths. Now go to dimension 3. Let $P_1=T\times[0,1]$, the prism with height 1 based on the regular triangle with side 1. Let $P_2=(\sqrt{2/3}H)\times[0,\sqrt{3/2}]$, the prism with height $\sqrt{3/2}$ based on the regular hexagon with side $1/\sqrt6$ (I hope that I get the constants right). I claim that they have the same projection area in every direction. More generally, consider a prism of height $h$ based on a convex figure $F$ of area $A$ such that the base is parallel to the $xy$-plane. Its area of projection along a vector $v=(\cos\alpha\cos\theta,\sin\alpha\cos\theta,\sin\theta)$, is given by $$ A\cdot \sin\theta+w(\alpha)\cdot h \cdot \cos\theta $$ where $w(\alpha)$ is the width of $F$ in the horizontal direction that forms oriented angle $\alpha$ with the $x$-axis. The constants in the above example are chosen so that the two prisms have the same $A$ and the difference in $w(\alpha)$ is compensated by the difference in $h$. 

Yes. Fix $x\in\Omega$ and let $r=d_\Omega(x,\partial\Omega)$, then $\Omega$ contains the Euclidean $r$-ball centered at $x$. So it suffices to construct $\phi$ supported in this ball with $\|d\phi\|\le 1$ and $\phi(x)\approx r$. A suitable smoothening of the 1-Lipschitz function $y\mapsto\max\{r-|x-y|,0\}$ does the job. 

Here is a counter-example to Q1. Consider a Reeb-like foliation on the annulus $E=S^1\times\mathbb R$. Namely fix a point $p\in S^1$, let $I=S^1\setminus \{p\}$ and fix a smooth function $h:I\to\mathbb R$ which tends to $+\infty$ at both ends of the interval $I$. One leaf of the foliation is $\{p\}\times\mathbb R$, and the remaining strip $I\times\mathbb R$ is foliated by graphs of the form $y=h(x)+const$. Note that all leaves are diffeomorphic to $\mathbb R$. There is a map $f:E\to S^1$ whose fibers are leaves of this foliation. First define $g:I\times\mathbb R\to(-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ by $g(x,y)=\arctan(y-f(x))$. Extend $g$ to the entire annulus $S^1\times\mathbb R$ by setting $g(p,y)=-\pi/2$. Now we have a continuous map $g$ from the annulus onto $[-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ whose fibers are leaves of our foliation. It remains to compose it with a continuous bijection from $[-\pi/2,\pi/2)$ to $S^1$, e.g. $t\mapsto(\cos 2t,\sin 2t)$. The resulting map $f:E\to S^1=:B$ is not a fiber bundle as a small neighbohood of a point on $\{p\}\times\mathbb R$ cannot have a connected inersection with a nearby leaf. Replacing $\arctan$ by a function which converges to its asymptotic values sufficiently fast, one can make the map $f$ smooth (with zero derivatives at $\{p\}\times\mathbb R$). 

No, here is a counter-example (to revision 9). Let $A$ be the linear map that sends the vector $(1,1,1)$ to $V:=(100,100,100)$ and is the identity on the orthogonal complement of this vector. Then any optimal cross-section is a hexagon whose plane intersects the six edges of $A(Q)$ separated from the vertices $V$ and $-V$. Indeed, any plane that avoids this configuration must intersect one of the edges adjacent to $V$. And the edges adjacent to $V$ are contained in the half-space $x+y+z\ge 100/3$, so any such section (and hence its minimal cube) has diameter at least $100/3\sqrt3\ge 10$. On the other hand, the intersection of $A(Q)$ with the plane $x+y+z=0$ is the same as the intersection of this plane with $Q$, so it fits in a unit cube (whose diameter is $2\sqrt3<10$). Hence no section of diameter $\ge 10$ can be optimal. 

These groups are not even quasi-isometric. (Two metric spaces are said to be quasi-isometric if they contain bi-Lipschitz equivalent nets. In the case of finitely generated groups, word metrics are assumed.) Indeed, it is well-known (and easy to prove) that the fundamental group of a compact Riemannian manifold $M$ is quasi-isometric to the universal cover $\tilde M$ (with the lifted metric). And $S^n$, $R^n$ and $H^n$ are not quasi-isometric by a simple volume growth argument. 

The comments explain how to prove the fact. If you want to put a formal wrapping around it, consider the strong (Whitney) $C^\infty$ topology on the space of maps $W\to M$. The strong $C^0$ topology on $C(M,\mathbb R)$ can be defined as follows: for every function $h:M\to\mathbb R$ which is positive and locally bounded away from 0 (but may tend to 0 at infinity), declare the set $$U_h:=\{f\in C^0(M): \forall x\in M \ |f(x)|<h(x)\}$$ a neighborhood of zero; this gives you a prebase of the topology. For smooth maps between manifolds the definition is similar but involves derivatives and a locally finite covering by charts (or, alternatively, a complete Riemannian metric, on which the resulting topology does not depend). In the strong $C^\infty$ topology, the set of proper maps is open, and the set of maps transverse to $Y$ is open and dense. For a reference, see e.g. Hirsch, "Differential topology" (1976), Chapter 2 and Theorem 2.1(a) in Chapter 3. 

This is not a reference but a short direct proof. Let $\bar X$ be the completion of $X$. Define $f:X\to\mathbb R$ by $f(x)=dist(x,\bar X\setminus X)$. Obviously $f$ is continuous, and the local completeness implies that $f$ is strictly positive. Let $X'\subset X\times\mathbb R$ be the graph of $1/f$. Then $X'$ is homeomorphic to $X$ and complete for the following reason: If $\{p_n\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $X'$, then the first coordinates of $p_n$ are a Cauchy sequence in $X$. Hence they converge to a point of $\bar X$. This point cannot be in $\bar X\setminus X$ because the second coordinates of $p_n$ are bounded. The metric on $X\times\mathbb R$ can be defined as the sum of two coordinate distances (any other common definition will work too).
