We don't have any measurements near 1 AU that are at high latitudes. Some spacecraft have done out of ecliptic polar orbits with high apogees, but the heliocentric latitudes were still within ~$10^{\circ}$ of the ecliptic plane. The notes above discuss our only real measurements out of the ecliptic by the Ulysses spacecraft. 

In space plasmas, ELF is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 Hz to ~3 kHz. Very low frequency (VLF) is used to describe waves in the frequency band ~3 kHz to ~30 kHz. Generally the cutoff frequency of the Earth's ionosphere prevents waves at such low frequencies from freely passing through it. In plasmas, this tends to be any wave at or below the local electron plasma frequency, which can be approximated as $f_{pe} \approx 8.9787 \ \sqrt{n_{e} \left[ cm^{-3} \right]}$ kHz (where the $\left[ cm^{-3} \right]$ implies that the electron number density, $n_{e}$, should be in units of $cm^{-3}$). The densities in the ionosphere are ~$10^{3} - 10^{6} \ cm^{-3}$, which corresponds to $f_{pe}$ ~ 280 kHz to ~9 MHz. Early studies found a relationship between lightning and a VLF emissions called whistlers. It is now known that high energy electron beams, associated with the lightning, escape into the magnetosphere. These beams radiate the whistlers through a plasma instability (i.e., free energy due to a fast beam streaming through an otherwise homogeneous plasma). So the free energy sources can escape the lower atmosphere, but the electromagnetic emissions at such low frequencies cannot. 

this is not really an answer to your question, but to the assumption you made. The BH in the galactic center cannot grow that much. There are two problems. First, there is not enough food close by. Any potential food (gas clouds, stars, and dark matter) will have some non-zero angular momentum preventing it from coming close enough. Loosing this angular momentum is difficult (it cannot be radiated away like energy), the only way is to exchange it with other objects either via impact (of gas clouds) or gravitational interactions with other objects (not the BH). The second problem is that a feeding BH is surrounded by an accretion disc of hot gas. In that disc, angular momentum is slowly transported outwards and mass inwards via viscosity (that viscosity most likely originates from turbulent magnetic fields that become unstable -- the magneto-rotational instability). This process inevitably heats the accretion disc to very high temperatures ($10^{6-9}$K) such that it emits a wind of raditation and particles (similar to the Solar wind, but much much stronger). If the BH feeds too much, this wind becomes so strong that it pushes away any further infalling material (potential food). This second process limits the growth of any BH to double in mass in no less than about $10^6$ years, I think (I'm not too sure--if you want a precise value, consult the literature), even if the first problem was no issue. 

Gravitational interactions with stars they pass could strip some Oort cloud bodies, or send then into the system as comets, or whatever Whatever caused this star to become a hypervelocity star in the first place (eg a close encounter with a supermassive black hole) might well have disrupted the Oort cloud, possibly fatally. 

The temperature of a black hole as seen from the outside is the temperature of the Hawking radiation, which @jyoti has discussed. The temperature you would experience as you fell freely through the event horizon, is a different question. I think the answer depends on what else is falling into the black hole at the same time. From its own viewpoint, everything that falls into a black hole reaches the singularity in a fixed maximum time (a few days for the very largest supermassive black holes) so you could only exchange energy with things that fell in around the same time as you did. If there was very little such stuff, then I don't think you'd notice anything out of the ordinary -- you'd be exposed to the cold of space, just as you were before (assuming the black hole is big enough that you haven't been heated up the tides of the black hole distorting you. On the other hand if lots of stuff was falling into the black hole with you then the whole lot would get churned up, and you'd be falling in as part of a mass of very hot plasma. Eventually, at least in a non-spinning black hole, you'd approach the singularity and be ripped apart by tides. 

Space, as we experience it, is simply three-dimensional Euklidean (flat) space. A flat space is one in which parallel lines never intersect. Consider the two-dimensional space of your kitchen table: (if your table is new) this space is flat. But the surface of a sphere, also a two-dimensional space, is not flat. In the same way a three-dimensional space can be curved (though this is hard/impossible to imagine). Time as we experience it is simply linearly progressing. You can combine space and time to a four-dimensional space-time, one dimension of which is time-like. The theory of relativity now says that this four-dimensional space-time is not always exactly flat and that any curvature of space-time is equivalent to a force. Any form of energy (and rest-mass energy is the most compact such form) curves space-time and hence exerts a force -- known as gravity. This curving of space time affects both space and time, hence gravity also affects clocks etc. For weak forces (any we experience as humans), the curvature effects are extremely minute. 

Velocity The solar wind speed has a large range of variation, between ~250–820 km/s [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009] near the ecliptic plane. These values are not including interplanetary shocks, which can have speeds exceeding 2000 km/s. The speed is generally higher at higher latitudes out of the ecliptic plane, tending to be over 650 km/s [e.g., McComas et al., 2008; 2013]. Number Density The number density also has a large range of values, from ~2–90 $cm^{-3}$ [e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Gopalswamy, 2006; Jian et al., 2011, 2014; Kasper et al., 2012; Maksimovic et al., 1998; Marsch, 1983; McComas et al., 2013; Schwenn, 1983; Stverak et al., 2008, 2009]. Again, these do not include interplanetary shocks or coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Charge State The alpha particle to proton number density ratio varies between ~1-5%, depending on solar cycle and solar wind speed [e.g., Kasper et al., 2012; Schwadron et al., 2014]. We have also measured the ratio of $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ and $C^{6+}/C^{5+}$, finding ~1-30% and ~20-200%, respectively [e.g., Schwadron et al., 2014]. 

Did you mean to ask Would life on Earth be possible if Earth was the only planet in the Solar system? The answer is perhaps , we can only speculate and know too little about the evolution of the planetary system to give any firm answer. The Moon, for example, (not a planet I know) stabilises the Earth spin axis, preventing it from flipping, which would otherwise happen (on long time scales) with drastic consequences for the Earth climate and hence any life forms. Jupiter (and to a much lesser degree the other outer planets) plays a significant role in the dynamics of smaller bodies (asteroids and meteroids), including absorbing them. If, for example, the meteroid and asteroid impacts on Earth were more frequent, that too would have drastic consequences for the climate and life. 

It's spread out in time. If a source emits a 1W pule of energy lasting 1 second and the receiver is receding so fast that it is Doppler shifted to a frequency which means the power is just 0.5W, then the pulse will take 2seconds to arrive (since the end of it had further to travel). 

The first thing you need to recall is that electromagnetic waves do carry momentum as well as energy. This shows up in effects like light pressure. Specifically a photon of wavelength $\lambda$ carries momentum $h/\lambda$. In and of itself, that doesn't answer your question though, since you are asking about the rotation of the pulsar, and changed to its linear momentum don't affect that. However, there are two ways this can happen. First imagine a rotating sphere which is emitting radiation from its equator. Consider a point on that equator. The radiation it is emitting "forwards" (in the direction towards which it is rotating) will be blue shifted (as seen by a stationary distant observer) while the radiation emitted "backwards" will be correspondingly red-shifted. Since the blue-shifted radiation has shorter wavelength, it has more momentum, the net effect is a force on the source which tends to slow the rotation. (interestingly, the same effect is used at much lower energy levels to trap ultra-cold atoms in what is called "optical molasses"). The second effect is a bit more technical. The radiation which is emitted towards the poles of the pulsar has a property called "circular polarization" and a beam of circularly polarized light carries away angular momentum. 

The properties of the terrestrial magnetosphere vary so widely, you would need to narrow down this question. For instance, the charge states are completely different (e.g., we observe $O^{1+}$ but not $O^{7+}$) but the number densities range from ~$10^{-2}-10^{3} \ cm^{-3}$. 

There is no net internal magnetic field to perturb, so how could one induce currents? The effect arises on Earth because some transient event (e.g., coronal mass ejection or CME) hits Earth's magnetosphere and causes a sudden $\tfrac{dB}{dt}$ which, from Faraday's law, results in induced electric fields. These induced electric fields then drive currents in things like power grids (typically long-distance wires running east-west at high latitudes), oil pipelines, etc. The only changing magnetic field would be that of the solar wind and the small, localized magnetic anomalies on the surface of Mars. However, these fields are incredibly small so the $\tfrac{dB}{dt}$ would be even smaller. 

It is possible the gravity changed locally. Depending on what the asteroid was made of, and the details of what happened in the collision, you might end up with a lump of denser asteroidal material buried in the Earth's crust under the impact crater. That could produce a measurable (although not noticeable to a human) increase in gravity locally. 

As has already been said, the major sources of change to Earth's orbit are interactions with other planets and passing stars. We're ruling out mass loss of the Sun, so the next consideration is probably tidal interactions between the Earth and Sun. This paper suggests that the Earth is receding from the Sun by about 15cm/yr for this reason. This is 150 km per million years, so over a trillion years or so, would move Earth quite a bit further from the Sun. The effect would reduce as the Earth got further away from the Sun, but I think it would always be slowly receding. I haven't done the calculation, but I'm not sure it would ever reach tidal lock -- the angular momentum of the Sun is too high. Independently of this, though, orbital energy and angular momentum would slowly be lost by gravitational radiation. This wikipedia page gives a formula $$t={\frac {5}{256}}\,{\frac {c^{5}}{G^{3}}}\,{\frac {r^{4}}{(m_{1}m_{2})(m_{1}+m_{2})}}.$$ for the time to collision ignoring tidal effects. We can plug in known values for the parameters $r = 1.5 \times 10^{11} m$, $c = 3\times 10^8 m/s$, $G = 6.7 \times 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2}$, $m_1 = 6\times 10^{24} kg$, $m_2 = 2 \times 10^{30} kg$ and get about $3.3\times 10^{30} s$ as the time to collision. I suspect that's the time until the centres of the Earth and Sun coincide, so the actual collision would be a bit earlier, but probably not enough to notice at this precision. So that's about 10 million million times the lifetime of the universe so far. I can't find enough information to work out how these two effects would interact. Clearly in the first $10^{12}$ years tidal evolution would be more important, but that conserves angular momentum and slows as the Suns rotation slows, whereas gravitational radiation actually carries angular momentum away, so might dominate in the long term. On the other hand the radiation drops as a high power of the separation, so we might have the Earth moving ever more slowly away from the Sun, while radiating gravitational waves of ever weaker strength, and never reaching tidal lock or starting to move back in. 

There is no gravitational phenomenon associated with exact alignment. (moreover, exact alignment never happens, there is always a small deviation). The directions of tidal forces are aligned and hence sum-up for alignment, but this maximum is quite broad and nothing spectacular happens near exact alignment. You need close to exact alignment (depending on the sizes of the objects) to get an eclipse of one sort or another (a Solar complete eclipse is quite spectacular). This presumably requires the closest to exact alignment of all possible effects, but is not gravitational. added in edit If the planetary orbits were exactly co-planar, then exact alignment of the three bodies would occur regularly. However, the chance for the planetary orbits to be exactly (to infinite precision) co-planar is zero. This is just simple probability of continuous (as opposed to discrete) random variables: The probability density $p(x)$ for a continuous variable $x$ is finite, hence finding a value between $x$ and $x+\delta x$ has probability $p(x)\delta x$, which goes to zero as $\delta x\to0$. The chance of hitting close to exact alignment is the smaller the closer you want it to be. 

The short answer is "yes" -- the property of being a black hole. Assuming the collision is at a reasonably low relative velocity, the black hole would consume most of the mass of the star, so that eventually you would be left with a much bigger black hole and a certain amount of matter and radiation heading away from the site where the collision took place. The details of how long this would take, how much matter and energy would escape and so on will vary depending on the exact structure of the star and the details of the collision. Essentially you can't disrupt a black hole much by throwing matter into it (if the matter you throw in is VERY dense, like another black hole or a neutron star there will be some temporary disturbance to the event horizon, but it will settle down in a fraction of a second), all it does is absorb the matter and get bigger. Even if the matter is super-hot dense fusing plasma from the centre of giant star. In the course of falling in, the matter gets distorted and heated (much hotter than the interior of even a large star) and sometimes whirled around the black hole, and this can appear as a huge explosion, but in the middle of it, the black hole is sitting there absorbing matter, largely unperturbed.
