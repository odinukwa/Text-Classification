A finite covering space of a disk with finitely many holes, is again a disk with finitely many holes; in particular it is still planar. If you lengthen all three edges of a triangle, its area increases. If $F$ is a field with two finite-index subfields $K$ and $L$, then $K \cap L$ also has finite index in $F$. There are exactly two Lie groups up to isomorphism that are diffeomorphic to a pair of circles. 

Gil's answer is better. My comments make sense in low dimensions. But in high dimensions, people have a lot of trouble making lattices with large kissing numbers at all. That turn of events didn't occur to me. 

$\newcommand{\R}{\mathbb{R}}$ Let $K$ be a compact convex body in $\R^n$, or some other $n$-dimensional vector space or affine space. Then every point $p \in K$ has an extremality rank, which is the largest dimension of a flat open ball $B$ such that $p \in B \subset K$. The 0-extremal points are thus the usual extremal points, while the $n$-extremal points are the interior points. Also, the finite-dimensional Krein-Milman theorem says that $K$ is the convex hull of its extremal points. Also, if we intersect $K$ with a hyperplane $H \subset \R^n$, then the extremality rank of a point $p \in H \cap K$ is either the same or one less than its extremality rank in $K$. In particular, the extremality rank of $p$ cannot decrease by more than 1. If $K$ has no 1-extremal points, then the extremal points of $K \cap H$ are all extremal points of $K$ as well. Let $K_n \subset S^2(\R^n)$ be the convex body of positive, semidefinite symmetric matrices with trace 1. Since you can canonicalize $p \in K_n$ as a symmetric form, its extremality rank can only depend on its rank as a matrix. (Well, an arbitrary change of basis won't preserve the trace, but that doesn't matter since it still yields a projective transformation on the trace 1 affine space. It may have been better to do this without the trace 1 condition, with closed cones instead, but the compact version is easier to see.) If it has matrix rank $r$, then it lives in the interior of an extremal copy of $K_r$, so its extremality rank is $\binom{r}{2}-1$. In particular, $K_n$ has no 1-extremal points. The extremal points are those of the form $v \otimes v$. After that are the 2-extremal points, which are rank 2 matrices $v \otimes v + w \otimes w$. Actually, you can see things most clearly by recognizing $K_2$ as a round 2-dimensional disk, which is a convex set that have "vertices" and interior points but no edges. Anyway, it means that if you impose any linear condition on PSD matrices represented by a hyperplane $H$, the extremal points in $K_n \cap H$ are still rank 1 matrices (that satisfy the same condition). Your question is a special case of this general result. You are looking at $K_3 \cap H$, where $H$ is the condition that the middle entry of the matrix equals the northeast or southwest entry. The extremal points are all of the form $v \otimes v \in H$, which forces $v$ to have the form $(x^2,xy,y^2)$. (Note that the complex version of $K_n$ is an important object in quantum information theory; it's convex body of mixed states on an $n$-state qudit. That is how I learned about this.) 

I collected Kim Greene's answers into one, which unfortunately makes it look like the answer came from me. (They are fine answers, just not mine.) My own answer is that in Kim's list, only the Notices and the Intelligencer provide a good graduate/professional perspective on mathematics. However, those two aside, the "magazines" that you read should also include the four best Internet resources for serious mathematics: The arXiv, MathSciNet, Wikipedia, and now this site. There are other fine math web sites out there, but as far as I know, nothing else is as important as these four. 

One answer is that many of them aren't, by the PCP theorem. This was a dramatic discovery of the early 1990s. Even the Traveling Salesman Problem does not have a PTAS unless P = NP. (See also the classic original paper.) 

An improved answer: Simon's book later shows that the automorphism tower of the finite group $D_8$ has height $\omega+1$, and that for general finite groups no one even knows a good transfinite bound. (The $8$ may look like a typo for $\infty$, but it's not :-).) Apparently the centerless condition is essential in Wielandt's condition. Also, to clarify what these references mean by the automorphism tower, they specifically use the direct limit of the conjugation homomorphisms $G \to \mbox{Aut}(G)$. $D_8$ is abstractly isomorphic to its automorphism group. This is a different version of the question that I suppose does not have a transfinite extension. Section 5 of Thomas' book implies that it's an open problem whether the tower terminates in this weaker sense, for finite groups. Finally an arXiv link to Joel Hamkins' charming paper, Every group has a terminating transfinite automorphism tower. 

It seems that the one of the people in Wikipedia, Governor Henry Howland Crapo of Michigan, has exactly the same name as the mathematician Henry Howland Crapo who got a PhD from Rota and eventually moved to France. I conjecture that it is not a coincidence. The latter Crapo is still alive, I think, because he submitted a paper to the arXiv himself in April of this year. So you could ask him how to pronounce his name, and about his genealogy. The answer to the first will presumably be what Jason Dyer said, Cray'-Poe (as in Seymour Cray and Edgar Allan Poe). It is true that the name is originally a French word, but it is an entirely American name. According to the reference, the first Crapo was a French castaway who was found on Cape Cod in the 17th century. He was nicknamed crapaud (toad) just because he was French. 

The so-called "box" dimension is best interpreted as a cheap approximation to Hausdorff dimension. Hausdorff dimension is much more robust, but it is not preserved by homeomorphisms. All Cantor sets in the line $\mathbb{R}$ are equivalent under ambient homeomorphism, but their Hausdorff dimension takes all values in the interval $[0,1]$. So there you have metrics on $\mathbb{R}$ that give you different answers, moreover metrics that are all the same metric in different positions. By taking products of Cantor sets, an abstract Cantor set can have any Hausdorff dimension in $[0,\infty]$. Things are better for bi-Lipschitz changes of metric. By a simple computation, a bi-Lipschitz change of metric has a bounded effect on Hausdorff measure, and therefore cannot change Hausdorff dimension. Unfortunately, although your different metrics are mutually bi-Lipschitz on $G$, as written they are not bi-Lipschitz on $X$. Meanwhile there are various definitions of topological dimension, which are all integer-valued and generally agree on well-behaved topological spaces. The Wikipedia article on dimension lists some of them. The bad news is that $X$ is a Cantor set and its topological dimension is zero by any common definition. 

Even though this question has an accepted answer, the answers so far are not complete or explicit. I kept working on this question, because I have been curious for a long time about the structure of Dolbeault complexes. First of all, the Frölicher spectral sequence does not directly reveal all of the non-Hodge information in the Dolbeault complex of a non-Kähler complex manifold. I learned from Mikhail Khovanov that in the category of bounded double complexes over a field, every object is isomorphic to a unique direct sum of indecomposable objects. Moreover, the indecomposable double complexes can be classified as squares, dots, and zigzags. Here is an example of each type of indecomposable, with the convention that omitted cells and arrows are 0: $$\begin{matrix} \mathbb{C} & \rightarrow & \mathbb{C} \\\\ \uparrow & & \uparrow \\\\ \mathbb{C} & \rightarrow & \mathbb{C} \end{matrix}\qquad\qquad \mathbb{C}\qquad\qquad \begin{matrix} \mathbb{C} & \rightarrow & \mathbb{C} \\\\ & & \uparrow \\\\ & & \mathbb{C} & \rightarrow & \mathbb{C} \end{matrix} $$ This is actually a standard result about an $A_\infty$ quiver algebra with alternating arrows. To be precise about the Hodge theorem and the Frölicher spectral sequence, the $\partial\bar{\partial}$ lemma says exactly that there are no zigzags (other than length 1, which are then dots), which is then equivalent to the statement that horizontal cohomology is isomorphic to vertical cohomology. The squares are projective objects and do not contribute to any cohomology theory. The odd-length zigzags contribute to the total de Rham cohomology, while the even-length zigzags do not. Meanwhile there are two Frölicher spectral sequences, each of which detects half of the even zigzags. The Frölicher spectral sequences are insensitive to the odd zigzags, but you can still say that a Dolbeault complex is non-Hodge if it has odd zigzags, even though each Frölicher spectral sequence degenerates at $E_1$ if there are no even zigzags. The information of all of the zigzags, extracted by discarding only the squares, has been defined in the literature as "Aeppli cohomology". (Serre duality implies, sort-of indirectly, that the Aeppli cohomology of a compact manifold is self-dual; I would be interested to see a direct derivation of this fact.) Now, the Hopf manifolds. The most standard round Hopf manifold of complex dimension $n$ has an important group action of $U(n) \times S^1$. (For those who aren't familiar with the terminology, the standard Hopf manifold is $(\mathbb{C}^n\setminus 0)/\Gamma_r$, where $\Gamma_r$ is generated by rescaling by a real constant $r > 1$.) There is one aspect of my calculation that for me is a conjecture: That a connected, compact Lie group acts trivially on all of the zigzags of a compact manifold. This is true for odd zigzags since the de Rham cohomology has an invariant integer lattice, but I do not have an argument for even zigzags. But let's suppose that it is so. The invariant part of the Dolbeault complex is algebraically generated by these differential forms of degree $(1,0)$, $(0,1)$, and $(1,1)$: $$\alpha = \frac{\bar{z} \cdot dz}{z \cdot \bar{z}} \qquad \bar{\alpha} = \frac{z \cdot d\bar{z}}{z \cdot \bar{z}} \qquad \omega = \frac{dz \cdot d\bar{z}}{z \cdot \bar{z}}.$$ (I use $z$ and $dz$ as a vector of functions and a vector of 1-forms, so that I can take dot products. I'm leaving out the wedge product symbol.) Then I calculated the following: $$\partial \alpha = 0 \qquad \bar{\partial} \alpha = \alpha \bar{\alpha} - \omega \qquad \partial \omega = - \alpha \omega \qquad \omega^n = n\alpha \bar{\alpha} \omega^{n-1}.$$ A basis for the invariant part of the Dolbeault complex is given by $\omega^k$, $\alpha \omega^k$, $\bar{\alpha} \omega^k$, and $\alpha \bar{\alpha} \omega^k$ for $0 \le k \le n-1$. The Poincaré series of the invariant complex is a matrix like this one: $$\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{matrix}.$$ After calculating the differential, my answer is that this decomposes as a dot at each corner, a zigzag of length 3 next to each each corner, and a progression of squares. Modulo the conjecture that all zigzags are invariant, this is a complete description of the Dolbeault complex. The $n=1$ case is an exception in which the Hopf manifold obviously is Kähler (it's a torus, and all complex curves are Kähler). In this case the invariant complex decomposes as four dots. 

Certainly if you're not just looking at deformation quantization, there is no reasonable way to make a functor that creates every quantum object from a classical object. I can't think of a rigorous obstruction offhand, but for instance there are a great variety of $C^*$-algebras, which are quantum compact Hausdorff spaces, that don't look anything like classical Hausdorff spaces. To give another example, it is technically true that there is a functor from finite sets to the quantum version, finite-dimensional matrix algebras. But this functor is so far away from an isomorphism of categories, using either unitary operators or completely positive maps in the quantum case, that it misses the point. One famous discovery is that the matrix algebras have more computational power (quantum computation) than finite sets or finite probabilistic spaces (classical computation). If a quantization functor is surjective on objects but far from surjective on morphisms, then that is a second level at which "quantization is not a functor". Here is a related point that may be of some interest. In some important cases, a quantum object is not the same as a classical object defined in the quantum category. In particular, a quantum group, defined properly as a Hopf algebra, is not a group object. A commutative Hopf algebra really is a group object in the reverse category of commutative algebras. In other words, a group object in the category of affine schemes is an affine scheme whose coordinate ring is a Hopf ring. The same is true of graded-commutative Hopf algebras. But a general Hopf algebra is a different beast, because the tensor product of noncommutative algebras is not a coproduct in the sense of category theory. Nonetheless the tensor product is the orthodox quantum equivalent of a coproduct, and a Hopf algebra is the orthodox quantum equivalent of a group. In free probability, you replace the tensor product with a free product, and that is perfectly interesting, but it is a modification of standard quantum probaibility. I am not sure if there is a good way to explain the difference between the orthodox quantum product and the categorical coproduct. (Maybe there isn't really anything to explain.) Well, one important feature is that the Hopf algebra axioms are self-dual. 

Qiaochu in the comments makes the point that there is another very important set of axioms for a projective space, namely the classical incidence axioms for a projective geometry. My favorite version is that a projective geometry is a spherical type $A_n$ building. These axioms are different in that they don't even pick a field beforehand. Indeed, there are projective planes that are not the standard projective plane over a field. It would be interesting to make axioms for a topological type $A_\infty$ building corresponding to the projective space of a Hilbert space. It seems plausible, and it could be a very different model from the von Neumann algebra model. But maybe von Neumann, the person, is still there in this idea, because the incidence geometry of a Hilbert space is also known as quantum logic. 

That's much easier and more standard than finite-dimensional subspaces of $L^1$. The answer is all norms in finite dimensions, or in the unit ball picture, all centrally symmetric convex bodies. Every polytope is a slice of an $n$-cube, so clearly you get all of those. But then the Banach-Alaoglu theorem in this case lets you take limits; the space of $d$-dimensional subspaces of $L^\infty$ is compact. The same argument works for $\ell^\infty$, which embeds in $L^\infty$. In fact in the case of $\ell^\infty$ you can simply explicitly make every centrally symmetric convex body in $d$ dimensions as an intersection of countably many antipodal pairs of half spaces, and take the corresponding embedding in $\ell^\infty$. 

Lawvere proposes one good answer for a reasonable category of metric spaces in which isomorphisms are isometries: the category of weak contractions. It is true that geometers sometimes use the category of weak contractions when studying metric spaces. There is another answer that is taken seriously much more often: The category of isometric embeddings. For instance, geodesics in Riemannian geometry are isometric embeddings of intervals, at least if they are short geodesics. The category of isometric embeddings may be too rigid to be profoundly useful, but in fact it is widely used. It behaves similarly to the only reasonable category structure on fields, since every homomorphism of fields is injective. Also, Lipschitz maps and coarse Lipschitz maps are two among several interesting forgetful category structures on the class of metric spaces. But note that Andrew was asking about category structures that aren't forgetful. For those interested in other forgetful category structures on metric spaces, one of my favorites is the forgetful functor to uniform spaces. Maybe it's even worth making a list of both types of category structures on metric spaces. 

In the separable case, as the question already notes, what you're really asking about is finite extensions and ultimately group theory. A finite, separable field extension is equivalent to transitive permutation group $G$ acting on a finite set $X$. This is in turn equivalent to a pair of groups $H \subseteq G$, with $X = G/H$, up to the equivalence of quotienting by a $G$-normal subgroup that lies in $H$. The invariant partitions of $X$ correspond to intermediate subgroups, which then in the Galois theory setting correspond to intermediate fields. If there are no invariant partitions, then $G$ is called primitive. Also, for every permutation group $G/H$, it is easy to find some field extension modeled by $G/H$, even though it is a famous open problem to always find such an extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. So the question is when the $G$-invariant partitions of $X = G/H$ are totally ordered. The first remark is that if they are totally ordered, then actually the combinatorics of these partitions is completely determined by their relative indices. In other words, $X$ is divided into $n_1$ parts, then each part is divided into $n_2$ parts, and so on, and there is no structure other than this sequence of integers. In the Galois example where $H$ is trivial and $G = \mathbb{Z}/p^k$, each $n_i = p$. So, $G$ is some group that acts on this tower of partitions. The second remark is that for a given tower of partitions, there is a maximal choice of $G$, namely all of the automorphisms of the tower of partitions. This is an iterated wreath product of the symmetric groups $S_{n_i}$. This is an example where there are no other invariant partitions, hence they are totally ordered. In fact, any iterated wreath product of primitive groups works just as well. These constructions correspond in Galois theory to starting with a base field $K$ and adjoining one root each of a sequence of primitive polynomials (primitive in the sense that the Galois group acts primitively on the roots), chosen "generically" so that the total Galois group is the wreath product. If $\mathcal{P}$ is the tower of partitions, then the general example is a group $G \subseteq \text{Aut}(\mathcal{P})$ that happens not to have any other invariant partitions. I think that it's a complicated question to find all examples. From this viewpoint, it seems a bit accidental that $$\mathbb{Z}/p^k \subseteq S_p \wr S_p \wr \cdots \wr S_p$$ is still big enough that the invariant partitions are linearly ordered. So I don't think that there is any principle of reducing to the Galois case.
