At least in the semisimple case, it doesn't seem like there can be a theory of 3/4-Lie superalgebras other than a fairly predictable set of examples within Cartan-Weyl theory. I don't know how to do all of the relevant calculations, but it is easy to see roughly how they would go. Suppose that the even part $s_0$ is a semisimple Lie algebra $g$. Then $s_1$ is can be a self-dual representation $V$ of $g$. Unless possibly $g$ is $E_6$, I don't think that $V$ can be anything other than a self-dual representation. So then the form is a symmetric element of $\mathrm{Inv}(g \otimes V \otimes V)$, which is a vector space whose dimension can be computed. The dimension is at most the rank of $g$ when $V$ is irreducible. Indeed it is usually the rank of $g$, when the highest weight of $V$ is far away from the walls of the Weyl chamber. The dimension of the symmetric part is smaller, but it is often non-zero. (This is the part that I don't know how to compute off the top of my head.) So inevitably there will be a classification of these 3/4 Lie algebras using these branching rules. Besides the classification, the only theory that springs to mind is representations of these 3/4 Lie algebras. A representation $W$ would first off be a representation of $g$ (and I suppose a super vector space?). Then there would be a $g$-invariant map $V \otimes W \to W$ which represents the action of $V$. I don't see a rationale for imposing restrictions on this map other than $g$-invariance, for otherwise $g \oplus V$ would not be the adjoint representation of itself. So once again, there is some Cartan-Weyl classification that says what $W$ can be, and I'm not sure what more you could say. 

I may have spent enough time feeling frustrated that I can't find anything that resembles this quote in Google Books. :-) The closest that I came was a quote from Halmos in the book "Paul Halmos celebrating 50 years of mathematics". Halmos explained that he started walking a lot on his doctor's advice, as an alternative to hypochondria. This wasn't about walking in relation to research. Are you sure that it wasn't e-mail? 

Correction: JSE already thought of the first part of my answer, which I stated overconfidently. The estimate for $\log \chi(1)$ (and in the other cases of course) is an improper integral, I guess, so it does not follow just from the statement of Kerov-Vershik that the integral gives you an accurate estimate of the form $$\log \chi(1) = C\sqrt{n}(1+o(1)).$$ However, it looks like these issues have been swept away by later, stronger versions of the original Kerov-Vershik result. The arXiv paper Kerov's central limit theorem for the Plancherel measure on Young diagrams establishes not just a typical limit for the dimension (and other character values), but also a central limit theorem. 

In fact it helps immensely that $M$, $X$, and $Y$ are all Riemannian, so much so that the question is both true and not at all a generalization of Moise's theorem. Instead, you are looking for a smooth triangulation of $M$ that supports $X$ and $Y$. A much better citation is to Goresky's theorem that any smooth stratification of a smooth manifold is supported by a smooth triangulation. This theorem is not specific to dimension 3; and stratifications in this sense are much more general than transversely intersecting submanifolds. On the other hand, the special case of a transverse intersection was known long before. Actually all of Goresky's theorem was sort-of previously known; the merit of the paper was to clean up and unify previous knowledge. In general, in geometric topology, the hard direction is to go from continuous structures, to piecewise linear structures like triangulations, to smooth structures. Moise's theorem is about triangulating a topological manifold with no smoothness in sight --- so if the manifold is secretly smooth, the simplices of the produced triangulation could well be extreme fractals. On the other hand, Moise's theorem can be adapted to a variation of your question, in which $X$ and $Y$ are both collared and intersect transversely. This is in a way what you requested, but since your manifolds are smooth, not really what you want. Note that if $X$ and $Y$ are not collared, they could have Alexander horns, and then the supporting triangulation would not exist. 

Yes it is a surjection on $\pi_0$, because each component of $|Y|$ has at least one component of $Y_0$. Beyond that there are no restrictions. For instance, you can get any homotopy type for $|X|$ and $|Y|$ and any homotopy type for the map between them with $X_0$ and $Y_0$ just one point, as long as you ask that $\pi_0(|X|)$ and $\pi_0(|Y|)$ are trivial. (I'm taking "simplicial space" to mean a simplicial object in the category of topological spaces, say the compact Hausdorff ones.) 

Knot theory. Is an overhand (a trefoil) different from a nothing (an unknot)? Is a right-handed overhand different from a left-handed one? Yes and yes, according to Heegaard, Tietze, and Dehn from a century ago. Are there knots that aren't handed? For example, the figure-eight. Are there non-invertible knots? Yes, but that's harder; it was only established in 1964 by Trotter. Is it possible to distinguish any pair of knots? Yes, as was first proved by Haken in the late 1960s. How would you do it? The current best way is with Thurston's ideas, using hyperbolic geometry. (Hyperbolic geometry is then another big topic.) How many crossings do you need to switch to convert one knot to another? That is a big open problem, although it has been solved in many interesting cases. What's the easiest solution to the first of this whole chain of questions? Reidemeister moves and 3-colorings. Etc. Real algebraic curves. Hyperbolas, parabolas, and ellipses are all quadratic curves. A hyperbola has two branches, but these are halves of one oval that passes through infinity. How many ovals can you have in higher degrees? An indirect argument tells you that you can't have an unbounded number in any fixed degree. In degree 4 you can have 4 ovals; in degree 6 you can have 11 ovals. Harnack discovered and proved these upper bounds in the 19th century. Can the ovals nest any way you like? No... 

Victor in the comments asks for an application for this result for abelian groups. The original motivation was to extract information about what is possible for the cohomology of a topological space. The homology can be anything, provided that $H_0(X)$ is free and non-trivial. There are various obvious and not-so-obvious impossible choices for cohomology. For instance, this result implies that $H^*(X)$ cannot be countably infinitely generated as an abelian group. (And if it is so as a ring, then the degrees of the generators have to go to $\infty$.) I suspect that Jerry needs it for a similar reason. I found the result interesting because it gives an "external" criterion for whether a countable abelian group is finitely generated. Even though the forgetful functor to Set does not distinguish countable groups, it does sometimes distinguish their dual or derived dual groups. One of the things that it can determine is whether the original group was finitely generated. Also, assuming that the result holds for all PIDs, it is a natural and non-trivial generalization of the fact that the algebraic dual of an infinite-dimensional vector space $V$ satisfies $$\dim V^* = 2^{\dim V}.$$ Everyone learns this for vector spaces, so it's cool to have a module version. 

A bit more whimsically, you could call the configuration space of $n$ sign-ordered points in a manifold "the configuration space of $n$ fermions". Although a stricter model of the $n$ fermions is the local system or flat line bundle on $n$ unordered points, in which the holonomy negates the fiber when it induces an odd permutation of the points. This local system is similar to the sign-ordered space in the sense that the sign-ordered space is the associated principal bundle with structure group $C_2$. 

Complex numbers as they should appear in standard calculus and linear algebra. They tend to be postponed to upper division courses. Complex numbers greatly simplify both trig identities and partial fractions, but calculus students aren't told. Complex analysis. It tends to float to the top of upper division and disappear. Full multivariate calculus: The Jacobian of a general change of coordinates, the derivative of a multivariate inverse function, maybe also the multivariate Newton's method. The calculus sequence often chickens out and just does special cases of the first of these. Higher-dimensional Euclidean geometry. Like, the definition of an n-cube and the fact that it has 2n vertices. Multivariate probability, especially with both discrete and continuous features. 

David and Artem give a good summary of the "rules" for time complexity in the oracle model. I can say a little bit about the motivation for this model. Grover's search algorithm is sometimes described as a "database" search, but this is misleading. It is really meant for an unstructured computational search. I.e., it is for solving an equation $f(x) = y$ for $x$, when $y$ and $f$ are both given and $f$ is so complicated that you can't think of anything better than to guess $x$ arbitrarily. On the other hand, we suppose that evaluating $f$ is reasonably fast. An example application could be searching for a point on a complicated algebraic variety over a finite field, or searching for a password that you already have in encrypted form. Or more generally, searching for a solution to a combinatorial problem that is not only NP-complete, but devoid of any known shortcuts to exhaustive search. But the problem has to be in NP, meaning again, the ability to evaluate $f$ quickly. In this case the "oracle" means the function $f$, which is put into a black box because you don't have any particular understanding of it anyway. (On the other hand, in any relevant quantum algorithm, this conceptual "black box" has to be implemented with quantum gates inside the computer; it cannot be a physically separate black box.) The total time cost is now in two parts. The query cost is the number of times you have to evaluate $f$; the additional time cost is the number of other gate operations outside of evaluating $f$. In Grover's algorithm, the query cost dominates if you realistically assume that $f$ takes at least linear time to evaluate, because one stage of the rest of the algorithm only uses a linear number of gates with a low constant factor. On the other hand, since you don't have a precise conversion from queries to time, you can count queries and report that as the total work. 

If by finite you mean finitely presented, then the answer is no. For instance, Let $A = \mathbb{Z}[x]/(2x-1) = \mathbb{Z}[\frac12]$. Then, like $\mathbb{Q}$, $\text{Hom}(A,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$. 

Is "mass formula" a standard name for this concept? Is there a standard name? Can someone suggest a free on-line reference, comparable to a Wikipedia page or a little longer? The class textbook doesn't have a discussion. 

In response to Semyon's question in the comments: The concept of a $q$-analogue in combinatorics has never been entirely rigorous, and if anything the construction of quantum groups has been clarifying. The rough idea is that a counting problem in combinatorics is interesting when it has a "nice" answer, which often (but not by any means always) means an efficient product formula. So then a $q$-analogue is a weighted enumeration or finite generating function in which every weight is a power of $q$, and the enumeration still has all favorable numerical properties, and $q$-integers or cyclotomic factors arise. In the case of quantum groups, first of all they are Hopf algebras. A Hopf algebra is an algebra together with all necessary extra apparatus to define the tensor product of two representations as a representation (i.e., comultiplication) and the dual of a representation as a representation (i.e., the antipode map). A universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$ is of course a Hopf algebra. In this case, any deformation of $U(\mathfrak{g})$ as a Hopf algebra is potentially interesting. There is a cohomology result that if $\mathfrak{g}$ is complex and simplex, then there is only one non-trivial deformation, and you might as well call its parameter $q$ with $q=1$ at the undeformed point. (Sometimes the logarithm of $q$ is used and is called $h$, in reference to Planck's constant.) Since this is the only deformation, it is an analogue of some kind, and it is interesting. Moreover, there is a parametrization of the deformation so that $q$-integers (or quantum integers, in centered form) and cyclotomic polynomials arise in the structure of the Hopf algebra and its representations. The analogue thus deserves to be called a $q$-analogue. Theo's explanation illustrates this more explicitly. The quantum plane is a non-commutative algebraic space (in the sense that you can interpret it as a purely formal "Spec" of the quantum plane ring) that is associated to the non-cocommutative algebraic group version of $U_q(\text{sl}(2))$. So, then, in the ring of the quantum plane, if you just expand $(x+y)^n$, you get a $q$-analogue of the binomial coefficient theorem using Gaussian binomial coefficients. (Where the $q$-exponent of a word in $x$ and $y$ is its inversion number, just as with the $q$-enumeration of permutations.) This is one of many examples where $q$-analogues that were considered long before quantum groups appear in the theory of quantum groups. 

What I was really trying to do with the second point was not to propose a new construction, which I don't have, but rather to restate the question in an interesting way. The idea, in other words, is to attack a specific polynomial form $f(x) - c$ rather than to attack a specific field. Arguably the field is negotiable, because you can keep adjoining a missing root of each $f(x) - c$ when you want $f(x)$ to take the value $c$. A first step, suggested by the failed example $f(x) = x^n$, is to make an equivalence relation $a \sim b$ if $f(x) - a$ and $f(x) - b$ are both irreducible and adjoining one root produces isomorphic fields. If the equivalence class of $a$ is infinite, then it can't work as an avoided value. For example, all cubic polynomials are equivalent (up to adding a constant or a linear change of variables) to $x^3$, $x^3+x$, and $x^3+px$ where $p$ is some fixed non-square. Say $p=1$ in the second case. In the field $F(x)$ with $x^3 + px + q$, any element $y = 3x^2+\alpha x+2p$ has trace 0 and minimal polynomial $y^3+(9\alpha q+\alpha^2p-3p^2)y+r$ (according to Maple). I think that there are many ways to choose $\alpha$ to make the linear coefficient a square times $p$, and thus get $z^3+pz+c$ back again after rescaling $y$ to make $z$. If this is correct, then $f(x) = x^3+px$ is eliminated from contention and thus cubic polynomials are eliminated from contention. (But note that my brief calculation for the last step assumes that the characteristic is not $2$.) I wouldn't know how to show how any of these $f$-equivalence classes are ever finite. If that did happen, you would then want to look at whether two or more field extensions at attained values would capture a field extension at a value that you want to avoid.
