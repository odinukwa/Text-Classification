I have recently proved a result that gives a partial answer to this question, see here (I need to make some assumptions on $X$ and $Y$). Let $X$ and $Y$ be noetherian schemes with the resolution property (that is, every coherent sheaf is a quotient of a locally free sheaf of finite rank). This includes all separated regular noetherian schemes and all projective noetherian schemes. I don't know a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme which does not have the resolution property. If $X \times Y$ is also noetherian, then the category of coherent sheaves on $X \times Y$ is given by the Deligne tensor product of the categories $\operatorname{Coh}(X)$ and $\operatorname{Coh}(Y)$ of coherent sheaves on the two factors: There is an equivalence $\operatorname{Coh}(X\times Y) \simeq \operatorname{Coh}(X) \boxtimes \operatorname{Coh}(Y)$ of symmetric monoidal $R$-linear categories. There is an analogous result without the noetherian assumptions, but you have to consider the categories of finitely presentable quasi-coherent sheaves instead. If $X$ and $Y$ have the strong resolution property (which means that the locally free sheaves of finite rank form a generator of the respective categories of quasi-coherent sheaves), then there is an equivalence $\operatorname{QCoh}_{fp}(X\times Y) \simeq \operatorname{QCoh}_{fp}(X) \boxtimes \operatorname{QCoh}_{fp}(Y)$ of symmetric monoidal $R$-linear categories, where now $\boxtimes$ denotes Kelly's tensor product of finitely cocomplete $R$-linear categories. To prove this, I also show that this tensor product gives a bicategorical coproduct in the 2-category of "right exact symmetric monoidal categories," that is, symmetric monoidal finitely cocomplete $R$-linear categories for which tensoring with a fixed object is right exact. By passing to categories of ind-objects you find that the category of all quasi-coherent sheaves on the product is equivalent to the desired bicategorical coproduct. 

Totality is for example a consequence of cocompleteness and the existence of a small dense subcategory. If you have such a subcategory, with inclusion $K\colon A \rightarrow C$, say, then the functor $\widetilde{K} \colon C \rightarrow [A^{\mathrm{op}},\mathrm{Set}]$ which sends $c \in C$ to $C(K-,c)$ is fully faithful. Cocompleteness of $C$ implies that it has a left adjoint $L$. The reflection of a presheaf $F \colon C^{\mathrm{op}} \rightarrow \mathrm{Set}$ is then given by $L(F \circ K^{\mathrm{op}})$. To see this, note that for every $c \in C$, the functor $C(-,c)$ is the right Kan extension of $C(K-,c)$ along $K^{\mathrm{op}}$, which in turn follows from the fact that $C(-,c)$ is continuous and $A$ is dense. See for example A survey of totality for enriched and ordinary categories. Cahiers de Topologie et Géométrie Différentielle Catégoriques, 27 no. 2 (1986), p. 109-132 (Section 6) for more examples and a more elaborate theorem, of which the above is a consequence. Your second suggestion seems to me to be equivalent to cocompleteness of the category in question. Tautologically, every representable functor admits a reflection, given by the representing object. If your category is (small) cocomplete, then the presheaves which admit reflections are closed under small colimits. 

Unfortunately I don't have an answer to the actual question. If you ask for more than just a model category I think there are examples: There is no combinatorial symmetric monoidal simplicial model category $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\mathbf{Ho}(\mathcal{S})$ is the stable homotopy category and every object of $\mathcal{S}$ is both fibrant and cofibrant. Otherwise the forgetful functor $\mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbf{sSet}$ given by homming out of the unit object gives a symmetric monoidal Quillen adjunction which seems to have "too many good properties." Here is a sketch: As a right Quillen adjoint it commutes with the formation of loop spaces (up to equivalence), and it preserves all weak equivalences, hence it should factor through the zero-space functor from $\Omega$-prespectra to $\mathbf{sSet}$. Since everything is fibrant, it should be possible to transfer the model structure on $\mathcal{S}$ to commutative algebras in $\mathcal{S}$ (use combinatorial for this). The above two facts taken together contradict Remark 11.2 of the paper May, J. P. What precisely are $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces and $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra? New topological contexts for Galois theory and algebraic geometry (BIRS 2008), 215–282 where this is deduced from a result due to Lewis (Theorem 11.1 in the above paper). 

Here are a few comments that might be useful. I don't think there is a chance that this can work unless the scheme in question has the resolution property (meaning every coherent sheaf is a quotient of a locally free sheaf of finite rank). Otherwise the category of locally free sheaves does not even form a generator of the category of all quasi-coherent sheaves, so it clearly contains more information. Secondly, Quiaochu Yuan's construction for the affine case does not work globally for most schemes. What he does is indeed freely adding cokernels (to get to coherent sheaves) or freely adding all colimits (to get to quasi-coherent sheaves). The free cocompletion under all colimits of an additive category is given by taking the category of additive presheaves on it. (The free cocompletion under cokerenels is simply the closure of the representables under cokernels.) So, if we do that to the category of vector bundles on a scheme, we obtain a category of presheaves. However, any category of presheaves has a projective generator, while the category of quasi-coherent sheaves rarely does. Finally, something positive that can be said: If you do assume that your scheme satisfies the resolution property (and I'll assume it is quasi-compact, not sure if that's necessary), then the full subcategory of vector bundles is a dense subcategory of the category of quasi-coherent sheaves. This is actually a quite amazing result: in a Grothendieck abelian category, any strong generator is dense, see Brian Day and Ross Street, Categories in which all strong generators are dense, J. Pure Appl. Algebra 43 (1986), no. 3, 235–242. MR 868984 Thus we know that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves is a reflective subcategory of the free cocompletion of the category of vector bundles. Any reflective subcategory is the localization of the surrounding category at the morphisms that the reflector inverts (that is, it can be obtained by formally inverting a class of morphisms). Since we're dealing with a locally finitely presentable category, this can be further reduced to inverting a generating set of these morphisms. In some sense this says that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves can be obtained by first freely adding colimits, and then imposing some relations (formally turn a certain set of morphisms into isomorphisms). It seems however rather difficult to get an explicit such set of morphisms in general. Edit: I noticed that you're also interested in algebraic spaces and algebraic stacks. The above argument about the category of quasi-coherent sheaves also works at that level of generality as long as the resolution property holds. Specifically, if you have a quasi-compact stack $X$ on the fpqc-site of affine schemes which has the resolution property (in algebraic topology these are sometimes called Adams stacks, since they are precisely the stacks associated to Adams Hopf algebroids), then the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$ is given by a localization of the free cocompletion of the category of dualizable quasi-coherent sheaves on $X$ at a set of morphisms. Note that it is not clear from this argument wether or not this set of morphisms is entirely determined by the subcategory of dualizable quasi-coherent sheaves. If that is not the case, there could be Adams stacks in the above sense with equivalent categories of dualizable sheaves but inequivalent categories of quasi-coherent sheaves. 

The answer to the first part is indeed true. In fact, something more general is true. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a small category and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a cocomplete category (which is locally small, i.e., there is just a set of morphism between any two objects). Then any cocontinuous functor $L \colon \mathrm{Set}^{\mathcal{A}^\mathrm{op}} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ has a right adjoint, given by $C \mapsto \mathcal{C}(K-,C)$, where $K \colon \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$ is the composite of the Yoneda embedding and $L$. This is for example proved in Kelly's "Basic concepts of enriched category theory", Theorem 4.51. He proves the enriched version of this result, where $\mathrm{Set}$ is replaced by any complete and cocomplete category $\mathcal{V}$. I must say I don't know of a reference that just treats the $\mathrm{Set}$-case. If the target is the category of presheaves on some large category, then this might fail. Take for example $\mathcal{D}$ the large discrete category whose objects are sets, and let $F \colon \mathcal{D} \rightarrow \mathrm{Set}$ be the canonical inclusion functor. Then the functor $\mathrm{Set}\rightarrow \mathrm{Set}^{\mathcal{D}}$ which sends a set $X$ to the functor $F\times X$ (i.e., the functor which sends a set $A$ to $A\times X$) is cocontinuous, because $A\times -$ preserves colimits. However, there is a proper class of natural transformations $F \rightarrow F$ (a natural transformation just amounts to choosing an endomorphism of each set with no compatibility conditions), so if this functor had a right adjoint $R$, then we would have a bijection $\mathrm{Set}(\ast,RF) \cong \mathrm{Set}^{\mathcal{D}}(F,F)$, i.e., $RF$ would have to be a proper class. The reason for this failure is of course that $\mathrm{Set}^\mathcal{D}$ is not locally small. Note that this problem doesn't go away when we use universes: the above example would give you an isomorphism between a small set and a large set, i.e., a set outside of the universe. 

Yes, any Grothendieck abelian category has enough injectives. I believe this goes back to Grothendieck's Tohoku paper. The category in question is Grothendieck abelian since it is equivalent to a category of additive presheaves. The domain category has objects the integers, and morphisms generated by $d_n: n \rightarrow n+1$ (or the other way around depending on your grading conventions), subject to the relations $d_{n+1} \circ d_n=0$. 

The paper: When projective does not imply flat, and other homological anomalies, Theory and Applications of Categories, Vol 5, pp. 202-250, 1999, available here by Gaunce Lewis shows that this behaviour is quite common in categories of Mackey functors for compact Lie groups. These categories arise very naturally in equivariant stable homotopy category. Here is a quote from the abstract: "These examples were not fabricated to illustrate the abstract possibility of misbehavior. Rather, they are drawn from the literature." 

The answer to your question is no. Take a finite set S with two non-isomorphic monoid structures (for example, the four element set with its two group structures). Let $k^{(S)}$ be the algebra of $k$-valued functions on $S$ with pointwise multiplication. Both monoid structures on $S$ induce a comultiplication on $k^{(S)}$. Hence they define two monoidal structures on the category of $k^{(S)}$-modules, together with strong monoidal structures on the forgetful functor $F$ to vector spaces. Thus, if you forget about the monoidal structure of $F$ you can reconstruct $k^{(S)}$ as an algebra, but you won't be able to reconstruct the comultiplication. 

The category you described can be written as a lax limit of a diagram in the 2-category of categories. The diagram in question consists of accessible categories and accessible functors, so its limit is again accessible by a theorem of Makkai and Paré. It is obvious from the construction that the category has all small limits (they are computed as in the category of Banach spaces and nonexpanding maps), so it is in fact locally presentable. This means that it has all colimits and in particular an initial object. Here are some more details and references. Let $\mathbf{Ban}_1$ be the category of Banach spaces and nonexpanding maps. This category is locally $\aleph_1$-presentable (see e.g. Borceux, Handbook of Categorical algebra, Volume II, 5.2.2.e). Let $F \colon \mathbf{Ban}_1 \rightarrow \mathbf{Ban}_1$ be the functor which sends a Banach space $X$ to $\mathbb{R}+X\oplus X$, where + stands for the coproduct. A morphism f of Banach spaces gets sent to $\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}}+f\oplus f$. Let $U \colon \mathbf{Ban}_1 \rightarrow \mathbf{Set}$ be the functor which sends a Banach space to its underlying set. Since $\aleph_1$-filtered colimits are computed as in the category of sets (see e.g. Borceux, Handbook of Categorical algebra, Volume II, 5.2.2.e) we know that the composite UF preserves $\aleph_1$-filtered colimits. By the open mapping theorem it follows that $F$ preserves $\aleph_1$-filtered colimits. By the theorem of Makkai and Paré (see e.g. Adámek, Rosický, Locally Presentable and accessible categories, Theorem 2.77), the inserter $\mathcal{C}$ of $F$ and the identity functor on $\mathbf{Ban}_1$ is again an accessible category. The objects of $\mathcal{C}$ are triples $(X,\xi,u)$ where $\xi\colon X\oplus X \rightarrow X$ and $u\colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow X$ are nonexpanding (i.e., u corresponds to an element of $X$ of norm less than or equal one). The morphisms are morphisms of Banach spaces which are compatible with $u$ and $\xi$. Thus $\mathcal{C}$ is almost the category we are interested in; the only thing that's missing is the requirement that $\xi(u,u)=u$. Let $G \colon \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathbf{Ban_1}$ be the functor which sends every object to $\mathbb{R}$ and every morphism to $\mathrm{id}_{\mathbb{R}}$. This is clearly a functor which preserves $\aleph_1$-filtered colimits. Let $H \colon \mathcal{C} \rightarrow \mathbf{Ban_1}$ be the functor which sends $(X,\xi,u)$ to $X$ and a morphism to itself; this is again a functor which preserves $\aleph_1$-filtered colimits. There are two natural transformations $\alpha,\beta \colon G \Rightarrow H$, whose component at $(X,xi,u)$ is given by $u$ and $\xi(u,u)$ respectively. The equifier of $G$ and $H$ is precisely the category we are looking for, and from our construction we can conclude that it is accessible. The obvious forgetful functor to Banach spaces creates limits, so this category is complete. Thus it is locally presentable, and therefore also cocomplete. In particular, it follows that our category has an initial object. 

This is true, even if the ring extension is not necessarily flat. It follows from the fact that $F$ is right exact. First some generalities: given an additive category $\mathcal{A}$ I will write $\mathcal{PA}$ for the category of additive presheaves (that is, additive functors ${\mathcal{A}}^{\mathrm{op}} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ab}$). The question when additive left Kan extensions of additive functors with target $\mathrm{Ab}$ along the Yoneda embedding $Y \colon \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{PA}$ are exact is well studied: given an additive functor $F \colon \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ab}$, the left Kan extension $\mathrm{Lan}_Y F \colon \mathcal{PA} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ab}$ is exact if and only if $F$ is flat, which by definition means that the category of elements of $F$ is cofiltered. This follows in particular if $\mathcal{A}$ has finite limits and $F$ preserves them. The theory of flat functors at this level of generality is for example developed in the paper by Oberst and Röhrl "Flat and coherent functors," Journal of Algebra, Volume 14. If we have a functor $F \colon \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ we can use this to study exactness of the left Kan extension $\mathrm{Lan}_{Y} YF \colon \mathcal{PA} \rightarrow \mathcal{PB}$. (For the case we're interested in, the functor $F$ here will be the opposite of the functor $F$ in the question.) This functor is exact if and only if its composite with all evaluation functors $\mathrm{ev}_B \colon \mathcal{PB} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ab}$ is exact. As a left adjoint, $\mathrm{ev}_B$ preserves left Kan extensions. This reduces the problem to checking that for all objects $B \in \mathcal{B}$, the functor $\mathcal{B}(B,F-) \colon \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ab}$ is flat. This is in particular the case if $\mathcal{A}$ has finite limits and $F$ preserves them. To apply this in the situation at hand, we take $\mathcal{A}=fp(R)^{\mathrm{op}}$ and $\mathcal{B}=fp(S)^{\mathrm{op}}$. Both these categories have finite limits (since finite colimits of finitely presentable modules are again finitely presentable), and the functor $\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B}$ preserves finite limits (since $\phi_!$ preserves finite colimits). From the result mentioned above it follows that the induced functor $\mathcal{PA} \rightarrow \mathcal{PB}$ is exact. Note that we did not use the fact that $\phi_!$ preserves finite limits as well. This would be necessary to prove exactness of the induced left adjoint between the categories of contravariant functors on $fp(R)$ and $fp(S)$. In fact, here we run into the difficulty that these categories do not in general possess finite limits, so we have to go back to the definition of flatness to prove this "dual" result. Edit: here are some details for the dual result (where $\mathcal{A}=fp(R)$ and $\mathcal{B}=fp(B)$), which is indeed a bit trickier. As mentioned above, we need to check that the category of elements of $\mathcal{B}(B,F-)$ is cofiltered for every finitely presentable $S$-module $B$. It is certainly non-empty since it contains the zero morphism. Moreover, given two objects $(A, f \colon B \rightarrow FA)$ and $(A^{\prime},f^{\prime} \colon B\rightarrow FA^{\prime})$, the two projections out of the direct sum give morphisms from $(A\oplus A^{\prime}, (f,f^{\prime}) \colon B \rightarrow F(A\oplus A^{\prime}))$ to these two objects in the category of elements. It only remains to check the condition on a pair of morphisms between two objects in the category of elements. Since $F$ is addtitive, this reduces to the following condition: Given a morphism $f \colon B \rightarrow FA$ of $S$-modules and a morphism $g \colon A \rightarrow A^{\prime}$ between finitely presentable $R$-modules with $Fg \circ f=0$, there exists a finitely presentable $R$-module $K$, morphisms $k \colon K \rightarrow A$ and $h \colon B \rightarrow FK$ such that $gk=0$ and $Fk \circ h=g$. To see that such a pair $(K,k)$ exists, let $k^{\prime} \colon K^{\prime} \rightarrow A$ be the kernel of $g$ in the category of all $R$-modules. By assumption, the functor $\phi_!$ preserves this kernel, so we get a morphism $f^{\prime} \colon B \rightarrow \phi_! K^{\prime}$ such that $\phi_! k^{\prime} \circ f^{\prime}=f$. We would be done if $K^{\prime}$ were finitely presented, which of course won't be the case in general. However, we can always write $K^{\prime}$ as filtered colimit $k_i \colon K_i \rightarrow K^{\prime}$ of finitely presentable $R$-modules $K_i$. This filtered colimit is preserved by the left adjoint $\phi_!$. Moreover, since $B$ is a finitely presentable $S$-module, there exists an index $i_0$ such that the morphism $f^{\prime} \colon B \rightarrow \phi_! K^{\prime}$ factors through $\phi_!(k_{i_0}) \colon \phi_! K_{i_0} \rightarrow \phi_! K^{\prime}$, that is, there exists a morphism $g \colon B \rightarrow \phi_! K_{i_0}$ such that $\phi_! (k_{i_0}) g=f^{\prime}$. The object $K=K_{i_0}$ and the morphisms $k=k^{\prime} \circ k_{i_0}$ and $g$ thus have the desired properties.
