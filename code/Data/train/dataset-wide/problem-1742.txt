Temperature ($T_{eff}$) can be quite tricky to determine accurately as it interrelates to a number of other fundamental measurements. Firstly, remember that the spectrum we observe from stars are pin-point, they give us the entire overall result and not a specific location or part of the star. We need to dissect the various parts to arrive at the fundamental parameters. We arrive at our results by iterating the values of the fundamental parameters until a model spectrum matches the true spectrum we observe. The issue is, like you say, the existence of a whole lot of uncertainties. The first of these (although it doesn't have a large effect) is the Uncertainty Principle itself. This creates natural line broadening due to the emitted photon having a range of frequencies. The width of the line is determined by; $$\Delta E \approx \frac{h}{T_{decay}}$$ where $\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in the energy, $h$ is the Planck constant, and $T_{decay}$ is the amount of time the electron stays in a high energy state before decaying. Fundamental parameters The rotation of the star causes a Doppler shift effect on the line spectra making it broaden. The faster the rotation, the broader (yet smaller) the line. Like the Uncertainty Principle, this is natural broadening as it doesn't impact the abundance of any particular element in the star. Measuring the rotational velocity ($V_{proj}$) depends on both its axis of rotation and our line of sight to the star. Therefore, we use a combination of both velocity about the equator ($v_e$) and the star’s polar inclination ($i$) to determine the projected radial velocity; $$V_{proj} = v_e sin i$$ Temperature ($T_{eff}$)impacts wavelength in such a way that higher temperatures impart higher random motions on the atoms. When these photons collide with an atom, they can cause the atom to become ionised, i.e. lose an electron. Different energy levels (and therefore temperature) will create different abundances at the various ionisation stages of atoms. The temperature of the stellar photosphere decreases as we move away from the core. Therefore the line profile represents a range of temperatures. The wings of the line arise from deeper, hotter gas which displays a larger range of wavelengths due to increased motion. The higher the temperature, the broader the wings of the line profile ([Robinson 2007, pg 58][1]). Here you can see the effect of various temperature values on the synthetic spectral line of FE I 6593 A. Red: $T_{eff}$ = 4000K; Black: $T_{eff}$ = 5217K; Blue: $T_{eff}$ = 6000K; 

"Constellations ecliptic equirectangular plot" by Cmglee, Timwi, NASA - Own work, $URL$ Licensed under Public Domain via Commons. As a result, the path of the ecliptic now officially passes through thirteen constellations: the twelve traditional 'zodiac constellations' and Ophiuchus (which was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy), the bottom part of which interjects between Scorpio and Sagittarius. 

The dither pattern varies from telescope to telescope. For example, the following image shows the dither pattern of Chandra telescope. 

Source: journeytothestars.wordpress.com So, the 13 constellations of the Zodiac are Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius and Ophiuchus. As seen from the (first) figure, the ecliptic also touches the edge of the constellation Cetus, though it in not usually included in the Zodiacal constellations. Note about Precession: Because the Earth in inclined (by $23.45^{\circ}$), it rotates like a top. This is called precession, which results in a shift in the position of the constellations relative to us on Earth. The result is that the 'Signs of the Zodiac' are off by about one month. 

The way telescopes work is pretty much the same in the optical and radio wavelengths- the telescopes collect electromagnetic radiation, rather than focusing at a point. There are multiple reasons for this, the main one being the amount of photons reaching the telescope from the region of interest is pretty low. In order to collect more photons, the telescope (or telescope array) has to 'look' into the area of interest for a long time- this is achieved in case of earth based telescopes by mechanically steering the antennae, so that they are pointed in the same direction for a long amount of time. The principle is pretty much the same in space. For looking at KIC 8462852, SETI used the Allen Telescope Arry, which is basically a set of 42 antennae scanning the skies in radio wavelengths. The problem of earth's rotation is basically solved in two steps by (radio) telescopes. 

Absolutely possible. There's nothing magical about a black hole. The gravitational pull of a black hole reaches as far as gravity would for another object of the same mass. If you replace the Sun with a black hole of the same mass, everything would continue to orbit it just as it currently does. Anything with mass has a gravitational force itself, and a black hole will attract anything with mass. Again, it's the same as our star having an effect on the Earth, and the Earth having an effect on the Moon. 

Microturbulence ($v_{mic}$) is the non-thermal localised random motion of the stellar atmosphere. It works in a similar way to temperature - an increase in the motion of atoms creates a wider range of wavelengths observed and therefore broader line profiles. In strong lines, saturation can occur when there aren’t any more photons to be absorbed. As microturbulence in these areas increases, it presents more opportunities for photons to be absorbed. This broadens the wings of the line profile increasing the overall strength of the line. We can use this fact to determine $v_{mic}$, by ensuring that the strength of the lines (equivalent width) have no correlation with their abundances. Finally, surface gravity which is a function of the star’s mass and size: $$log g = log M - 2 log R + 4.437$$ with $M, R$ being in solar units and $g$ in cgs. A star with a higher mass but smaller radius will invariably be denser and under greater pressure. By definition, denser gas has a higher number of atoms per unit of area (abundance), leading to stronger spectral lines. A gas under pressure provides more opportunities for free electrons to recombine with ionised atoms. For a given temperature, ionisation is expected to decrease with an increase of surface gravity, in turn increasing the abundance of atoms in the neutral or low ionisation states. The measuring of $T_{eff}$ As we've seen, there are a number of ways in which a spectrum of a star can be altered. The one you're interested in is temperature. As temperature is interrelated to all the other fundamental parameters, we need to treat them together as a whole and tease out the value of $T_{eff}$. We begin with a synthetic spectrum and modify its properties iteratively until it matches the shape of the star’s spectrum. Adjustments of one parameter will invariably affect the others. The spectra will match when the temperature, surface gravity, and microturbulence values (amongst others) are correct. This is obviously very time consuming although programs exist to help. Atmospheric properties can also be determined by other less time consuming means. Photometric colours can be used as a proxy for temperature, and absolute magnitudes for surface gravity. However, these determinations can suffer from inaccuracies due to interstellar extinction and are at best a close approximation. [1] Robinson, K. 2007, Spectroscopy: The Key to the Stars (Springer) 

The rotation of the Earth, UT1 and the Earth Rotation Angle are strictly measured agaist extragalactic light sources. Indeed, nowadays, UT1 is reckoned by using the definition you mentioned, a direct linear relationship with the Earth Rotation Angle between the intermediate celestial and terrestrial frames instead of the actual ficticious mean Sun, because of the impracticality of such a measurement in the context of modern accuracies that are needed by these frames. Here is a good reference to read about this complex topic: U. S. Naval Observatory, Precision time and the rotation of the Earth, Dennis D. McCarthy, IAU 2004, $URL$ EDIT - Here is a different approach that may also help in the understanding of this topic. The important thing to keep in mind is that nowadays, with the increasing accuracy needed by many modern applications, we needed reference frames and relationships between them that are as consistent and accurate as possible. For this we reference ourselves on the most stable and easily measurable objects. The problem with the Sun was that its location or mean motion cannot feasably be tracked with an accuracy of a few tens of microarcseconds, like quasars. Adopting a definition based on this would have introduced inaccuracies in the definition itself and complexified the relationships, thus undermining the accuracy of the whole system, because UT1-UTC is one of the links between the terrestrial and celestial frames. So the IAU decided to adopt a definition that is "disconnected" from mean solar time, while keeping it reasonably close to the mean Sun by using the adopted ratio. The ratio will be good for decades for civil purposes, and later refinements to keep it reasonably close to the mean Sun while maintaining continuity will be much easier to make anyway. Another way of imagining the problem is this: say you lived on a boat (Earth) and you needed very accurate measurements of objects around you on the boat and on the sea, say fish, whales, etc (satellites and planets). You see several things around you: the lights of other boats, the lights on a distant shore. Would you prefer to align yourself on another boat's blinding and dancing light (Sun), or on a much more stable and smaller light on the distant shore (quasars), to determine your boat's orientation? Using another moving boat as a reference for coordinate systems would complicate matters and introduce measurement errors while you try to position other objects relative to it. Using the distant shore, however, would make your reference much more stable and accurate, and that does not prevent you from tracking the approximate location of the nearby boat's light. To sum up, we now have two main reference systems: ITRS (Earth's crust) and ICRS (distant stars), and a link between them (ERA and polar motion) that is as accurate as possible. We keep UT1 close enough to the Sun for all civil purposes, while defining it with a very simple and direct formula related to ERA for accuracy, simplicity and continuity purposes. 

In historical astronomy, the zodiac is a circle of twelve 30° divisions of celestial longitude that are centered upon the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun across the celestial sphere over the course of the year. Historically, each of these divisions were called signs and named after a constellation: Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, and Scorpius. In 1930, the International Astronomical Union defined the boundaries between the various constellations, under Eugène Delporte , who,

There are thirteen modern constellations in the Zodiac. In modern astronomy, a constellation is a specific area of the celestial sphere as defined by the International Astronomical Union. In total, there are 88 constellations. Astronomy and Astrology are not the same thing. Astronomy is a science while Astrology is not. As such, I'll restrict myself to the historical and modern constellations of the Zodiac. According to Encylopedia Brittanica 

In general, the common practice is to dither exposures and fill in the gaps. The dither serves multiple purposes:

Solar analemma at 1400 UTC by Anthony Ayiomamitis, from solar-center.stanford.edu The best way to understand the effect of latitude on the shape of the analemma is to consider the effect of earth's axial tilt on the shape of the analemma. 

I believe the differences here are caused by the different timescales that are being used by SkyField vs NASA. It seems that SkyField uses the proleptic Gregorian calendar for dates in the past. However, NASA used the Julian Calendar for dates before 1582, so for example, the eclipse on 0150-12-06 (Julian) falls on 0150-12-05 in Gregorian. Also, I would use instead of , as ut1 is the timescale used by NASA. Using the geocenter can be a efficient way to check for eclipses worldwide. When observing from the geocenter, the penumbral shadow cone touches the Earth when the following condition is true: $$\mu ≤ arcsin(\frac{r_m + r_e}{d_m}) + arcsin(\frac{R_s - r_e}{D_s})$$ Where $\mu$ is the angular separation between the Sun and the Moon, $D_s$ is the distance of the Sun, $d_m$ the distance of the Moon, and the three constant radii are: Sun: $R_s = 695700 km$ Earth: $r_e = 6378 km$ Moon: $r_m = 1737.4 km$ This indicates that an eclipse, at least partial, is occuring somewhere on the Earth. The formula uses a spherical Earth as an approximation of its shape, so in some rare cases it can detect very near-misses by 20-25 km, but overall it is a good way to narrow down the search. Also, it is unnecessary to test this when the angular separation is outside the range 1.3° - 1.7°, since values below 1.3° always produce an eclipse, and values above 1.7° never produce one. I would also like to point out that uncertainties, mostly in Earth's rotation speed, make it very difficult to know where eclipses occured on the surface of the Earth for dates in the far past. The uncertainty becomes very large outside the range BC2000 - AD3000. This is the reason why NASA hasn't computed eclipse paths outside that range. According to research, the uncertainty could be as large as over 4 hours (several thousands of kilometers for eclipse paths) for dates before BC4000. See this explanation on NASA's Eclipse Web Site.
