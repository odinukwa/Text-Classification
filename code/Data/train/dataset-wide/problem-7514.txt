I'm surprised no one gave this answer. Every Banach space isometrically embeds in its second dual by a natural map. If this map is surjective, the Banach space is said to be reflexive. James gave an example of a Banach space which is isometrically isomorphic to its second dual but is not reflexive. 

I think it's the same problem. If a pure state on $l^\infty$ had distinct extensions to states on $B(l^2)$, then you could embed $B(l^2)$ into $B(l^2(\kappa))$ for $\kappa > \aleph_0$ and extend those extensions to $B(l^2(\kappa))$. Conversely, if every pure state on $l^\infty$ has a unique extension then every operator in $B(l^2)$ can be paved. This implies that we can pave the compression of any operator in $B(l^2(\kappa))$ to $l^2(X)$ for any countable subset $X$ of $\kappa$, and by an easy compactness argument you can pave the entire operator. So pure states would have to extend uniquely to $B(l^2(\kappa))$. (If that's too cryptic, you can think of a $k$-paving of the compression of $A$ to $l^2(X)$ as a $k$-coloring of the set $X$. Order the countable subsets $X \subset \kappa$ by inclusion, for each $X$ let $C_X$ be the set of $k$-pavings of $P_{l^2(X)}A|_{l^2(X)}$, and get $\bigcap C_X \neq \emptyset$ by compactness.) However, to editorialize: as you say, if KS has a negative solution (some pure states have nonunique extensions) then there may well be set-theoretic issues involved in saying which ultrafilters extend uniquely. But KS can be reformulated as an arithmetical question, so if it has a positive solution (which I believe is the answer that expert opinion now favors) then it is unlikely to have anything to do with set theory. For instance, see my paper The Kadison-Singer problem in discrepancy theory for a combinatorial reformulation in terms of finite sets of vectors in ${\bf C}^n$. 

Yes. The theorem was proven independently by Blecher, A new approach to C*-modules, Math. Ann. 307 (1997), 253-290 and Lance, Unitary operators on Hilbert C*-modules, Bull. London Math. Soc. 26 (1994), 363-366. (Google would have told you this.) [Correction: the result is due to Lance. However, the formula below which recovers the inner product is Blecher's.] In fact, the inner product can be recovered from the norm and $B$-module structure by the formula $\langle x,x\rangle = \sup\{r(x)^*r(x): r: X \to B$ is $B$-linear and $\|r\| \leq 1\}$, and then you get $\langle x,y\rangle$ by polarization. 

Sure, since $-\Delta$ is a positive operator, by the spectral theorem it can be realized as multiplication by a positive function $f(x)$ on some $L^2(X)$ space. Then $R(\xi)$ is multiplication by $\frac{1}{\xi - f(x)}$ and its operator norm is the sup norm of this function. If $\xi < 0$ then the function $\frac{1}{\xi - f(x)}$ is bounded by $\frac{1}{|\xi|}$ in absolute value, so as $\xi \to -\infty$ we have $\|R(\xi)\| \to 0$. The point is that $\|R(\xi)\|$ equals one over the distance from $\xi$ to ${\rm spec}(-\Delta)$. If you restrict $\xi$ to be positive the question is more interesting. On the unit circle ${\bf T}^1$ the eigenvalues of $-\Delta$ are the square integers, and for any $\epsilon > 0$ we can find $\xi > 0$ such that $|\xi - n^2| > \frac{1}{\epsilon}$ for every $n \in {\bf Z}$, so we can still ensure that $\|R(\xi)\| \to 0$. In other words, the eigenvalues are spaced farther and farther apart so $\xi > 0$ can be chosen arbitrarily far from the spectrum of $-\Delta$. But on ${\bf T}^4$ the eigenvalues of $-\Delta$ are of the form $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$ for $a, b, c, d \in {\bf Z}$, which means that every positive integer is an eigenvalue. Thus any $\xi > 0$ is at most $\frac{1}{2}$ units away from an eigenvalue, and therefore $\|R(\xi)\| \geq 2$ for every $\xi > 0$. 

I don't think there is any direct generalization of this proof. In the language of measure theory, Woronowicz's argument goes by starting with a probability measure $\mu$ on $X$ that has full support, then taking a weak* limit of the Cesaro means of the sequence of convolution powers of $\mu$. If $\mu$ doesn't have full support then you can't expect this limit to be translation invariant. And if $X$ is not metrizable, then it doesn't seem obvious right off that there are any probability measures with full support. Certainly there exist compact Hausdorff spaces for which no finite measure has full support. (Personally, I am satisfied with Woronowicz's proof as it stands, as I view the nonseparable case as rather esoteric and pathological.) 

Modern analysis is one large area where category theory has fairly minimal impact. Occasionally you see statements like "the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces is dually equivalent to the category of abelian C*-algebras". I'm sure I could think of examples of more substantive uses of category theory, but they're pretty rare. As a teacher, I've occasionally seen students with a background in category theory seemingly hindered by intuitions that don't work well (e.g., expecting the tensor product of Hilbert spaces to have the obvious universal property). However, I agree with Todd's comment. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need category theory for something you want to do, you are likely to suddenly find it much easier to pick up. At least, that's been my experience with other subjects that I thought I didn't like, until one day I needed them. 

If it's dissipative on $C_0({\bf R}^d)$ then it should be dissipative on $C_b({\bf R}^d)$ too. First check this in the case that $a$ has bounded support. The point is that if $a$ is supported on a ball of radius $r$ about the origin then $Af(x)$ only depends on values of $f(y)$ for $|x - y| < r$. So if $f \in C_b({\bf R}^d)$ and $x \in {\bf R}^d$ then for $R \gg r$ the function $$g(y) = \cases{\big(1 - \frac{|x - y|}{R}\big)f(y)&if $|x - y| < R$\cr0&if $|x - y| \geq R$\cr}$$ will satisfy $Ag(y) \approx (1 - \frac{|x-y|}{R})Af(y)$ for $|x - y| < R$. Thus $(\lambda I - A)g(y) \approx (1 - \frac{|x-y|}{R})(\lambda I - A)f(y)$ and the dissipation inequality for $g$ will imply approximately the same inequality for $f$ at $x$. For general $a$, approximate by $a$ with bounded support. This part is easy. 

Formally, we can define an operator $A$ on $L^2({\bf R}^d)$ by setting $$Af(x) = \int H(x,y)f(y) dy.$$ Then $$\langle Af, f\rangle = \int\int f(x)H(x,y)f(y) dxdy = \|f\|^2_H$$ (I am assuming real scalars, as I think you are). That is, you are just defining $\|f\|_H$ to be $\|A^{1/2}f\|$. The kernel $H(x,y) = \delta_0(x,y)$ corresponds to the case where $A$ is the identity operator. I don't know if there's a definitive answer to the question of what the weakest possible assumptions on $H$ are, but any bounded positive operator $A$ will define a seminorm by the formula $\|A^{1/2}f\|$. It will be a norm if and only if $A$ has no kernel. For your second question, as long as $\|J_\epsilon*f - f\| \to 0$, we will have $\|A^{1/2}(J_\epsilon*f - f)\| \to 0$ for any bounded positive operator $A$, that is, $\|J_\epsilon*f - f\|_H \to 0$. I guess the point is that your problem can be approached by looking at whether integrating against $H$ defines a bounded operator on $L^2({\bf R}^d)$. 

Edit: since we seem a bit deadlocked at this point, let me weaken the question. It's fairly easy to see that the set of 8-tuples of reals which can be the eigenvalues of a matrix of the desired form is closed. We know from jjcale and Caleb Eckhardt that its complement is nonempty. Is its complement dense? That is, would a generic 8-tuple not be the eigenvalues of such a matrix? 

You are looking for C*-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ which lack a nontrivial $*$-homomorphism $\phi: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}$ satisfying $\phi^2 = \phi$. That is equivalent to having a surjective $*$-homomorphism $\phi: \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B}$ together with a $*$-homomorphism $\psi: \mathcal{B} \to \mathcal{A}$ satisfying $\phi\circ\psi = {\rm id}_\mathcal{B}$. That is, your problem is equivalent to finding C*-algebras which cannot be the middle term of a nontrivial split exact sequence $$0 \to \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{B} \to 0$$ (where "nontrivial" means neither $\mathcal{I}$ nor $\mathcal{B}$ is zero). Well, being the middle term of a nontrivial split exact sequence is a very unusual property. "Most" C*-algebras in nature won't have this property. Any C*-algebra which is a direct sum of two nontrivial C*-algebras does have this property, as does any C*-algebra which is the unitization of another C*-algebra. (By $0 \to \mathcal{A} \to \tilde{\mathcal{A}} \to \mathbb{C} \to 0$.) Beyond that it gets kind of hard to come up with examples that have the property you are trying to avoid. 

$2 \times 2$ counterexample, $E = \left\{\left[\matrix{\lambda& 0\cr 0&\lambda}\right]: \lambda \geq 0\right\}$ and $A = \left[\matrix{1&1\cr 1&1}\right]$. Then for any nonzero $\zeta$ we have $\{\langle B\zeta,\zeta\rangle: B \in E\} = [0,\infty)$, so no $\zeta$ can separate. The general idea is that you can separate $E$ and $a$ with a bounded linear functional on $K(H)$, i.e., tracing against some trace class operator, but you can't expect to do it with a single vector. 

I wasn't aware of the previous work which called them "superalgebraic lattices". In my book on Lipschitz algebras I called them "Stone lattices" because they exhibit some analogies to Stone spaces. (In this analogy, completely distributive complete lattices correspond to compact Hausdorff spaces.) To add to Joseph's answer, you can identify ${\mathcal O}(P)$ with the set of order-preserving maps from $P$ into the two-element lattice ${\bf 2}$. And you recover $P$ as the set of complete $0,1$-lattice homomorphisms from ${\mathcal O}(P)$ into ${\bf 2}$. 

Nope. For each $n$ let $T_n$ be the $n\times n$ matrix all of whose entries are $\frac{1}{n}$. This is a rank $1$ projection. So $T = \bigoplus T_n$ is a projection with infinite dimensional range, and hence is not compact. But its diagonal entries go to zero as $n \to \infty$, which means that $D_T$ is compact. 

Yes. Find a strictly increasing sequence of indices $(n_k)$, $k \geq 1$, such that $\sum_{i \geq n_k} \|x_i\|^p < \frac{\epsilon}{2^k}$. Then define $\xi_n = 1$ for $n < n_1$ and $\xi_n = (k+1)^{1/p}$ for $n_k \leq n < n_{k+1}$. Now we have $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty \xi_n^p\|x_n\|^p = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \|x_n\|^p + \sum_{k=1}^\infty\sum_{i=n_k}^\infty \|x_i\|^p \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty \|x_n\|^p + \epsilon,$$ which is good enough. Not for general $(x_n)$. For example, let $x_n = n^{-2/p} \in \mathbb{R}$ and let $(\xi_n)$ be any sequence of positive numbers. For each $n$ we either have $\xi_n^p \geq n$ or $\xi_n^p < n$. In the first case, $\frac{\xi_n^p}{n^2} \geq \frac{1}{n}$, and in the second case, $\frac{1}{\xi_n^p} > \frac{1}{n}$. So $\sum\big(\frac{1}{\xi_n^p} + \frac{\xi_n^p}{n^2}\big) = \infty$ and therefore either $\sum\frac{1}{\xi_n^p} = \infty$ or $\sum \xi_n^p x_n^p = \sum\frac{\xi_n^p}{n^2} = \infty$. 

Tristan pointed out in the comments that my argument showing (2) $\Rightarrow$ (1) in general is faulty. Still, I think it's true for locally compact spaces. Suppose $X$ is locally compact, $Y \subseteq X$, and every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover of $Y$. Consider the covering of $X$ by all open subsets of whose closure is compact. Since finitely many of them cover $Y$, this implies that $\overline{Y}$ is compact. My answer to the original question follows. Let $(x_\alpha)$ be a net in $Y$ and suppose every open cover of $X$ has a finite subcover of $Y$. For each $\alpha$ let $F_\alpha$ be the closure, in $X$, of $\{x_\beta: \beta \geq \alpha\}$, and let $U_\alpha = X \setminus F_\alpha$. If $\{U_\alpha\}$ were an open cover of $X$ then by hypothesis there would be a finite subcover of $Y$, and then by directedness there would be a single $U_\alpha$ containing $Y$, which is absurd. So $\{U_\alpha\}$ cannot be an open cover of $X$, hence there exists $x \in X$ not in any $U_\alpha$, i.e., $x \in F_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$. So $x$ is a cluster point of the net. 

Do you want to require $f$ to be bounded? Otherwise there are easy counterexamples: take $G = \mathbb{Z}$, $\mu(1) = 2$, $\nu(0) = 1$, and $\mu$ and $\nu$ zero at all other points, and $f(n) = 2^n$. Then $\mu * f = \nu*f$ but $\|\mu\| = 2 > 1 = \|\nu\|$. 

I can solve this assuming the continuum hypothesis. (Edit: CH isn't needed, see below.) Lemma: if $A$ is a countable set and $(S_m)$ is a sequence of uncountable sets then we can find a sequence of disjoint countable sets $(T_n)$ such that $A \cap T_n = \emptyset$ for all $n$ and $S_m \cap T_n \neq \emptyset$ for all $m$ and $n$. [Proof: Choose a countable subset $S_1'$ of $S_1 \setminus A$, enumerate it, and put the $n$th element in $T_n$. Then choose a countable subset $S_2'$ of $S_2 \setminus (A \cup S_1')$, enumerate it, and put the $n$th element in $T_n$. Proceed in this way. Each $S_k'$ is countable so the difference $S_{k+1} \setminus (A \cup S_1' \cup \cdots \cup S_k')$ is always uncountable.] Now there are $2^{\aleph_0}$ open subsets of $[0,1]$ because any open subset is a union of rational intervals and there are only countably many rational intervals. So there are only $2^{\aleph_0}$ closed subsets of $[0,1]$. Assume CH and enumerate the closed subsets of $[0,1]$ of positive measure as $C_\alpha$ for $\alpha < \aleph_1$. Observe that each $C_\alpha$ is uncountable. Now we construct disjoint countable sets $T_{\alpha,\beta}$ for $\beta < \alpha < \aleph_1$ by recursion on $\alpha$ as follows. At step $\alpha$ let $A = \bigcup_{\beta' < \alpha' <\alpha} T_{\alpha',\beta'}$ (all the $T$s constructed so far, a countable union of countable sets) and apply the lemma to this $A$ and the sets $C_\beta$ for $\beta < \alpha$. There are only countably many $\beta < \alpha$ so we can do this, and we can relabel the resulting sets $T_n$ as $T_{\alpha,\beta}$ for $\beta < \alpha$. After this process is complete, for each $\beta$ let $T_\beta = \bigcup_{\alpha > \beta} T_{\alpha,\beta}$. Then the sets $T_\beta$ are disjoint, there are $\aleph_1$ of them, and each one intersects every closed subset of $[0,1]$ of positive measure, so each of them has full outer measure. Edit: actually this doesn't need CH. Every closed set is the union of a countable set and a perfect set, so if it has positive measure then it contains $2^{\aleph_0}$ elements. That's enough to keep the induction going for $\alpha < 2^{\aleph_0}$ since each $T_{\alpha,\beta}$ will have cardinality $< 2^{\aleph_0}$. 

I doubt there is a good general answer to the question. If $\pi$ is the GNS representation associated to a state $\omega$ and $\omega$ is invariant under $\phi$ then the automorphism of $\pi(A)$ is unitarily implemented since $$\langle \pi(\phi(x)),\pi(\phi(y))\rangle = \omega(\phi(y)^*\phi(x)) = \omega(\phi(y^*x)) = \omega(y^*x) = \langle \pi(x),\pi(y)\rangle.$$ So in that case $\phi$ induces an automorphism of $\pi(A)''$. Possibly a more helpful suggestion is to pass to the representation $x \mapsto \oplus \phi^n(x)$ on $\bigoplus_{n \in {\bf Z}} H$. The automorphism of $A$ induces an automorphism of the double commutant of its image under this representation because $\phi$ is implemented by the bilateral shift on $\bigoplus_{n \in {\bf Z}} H$. 

I think the source of confusion is in the definition of "norm-continuous representation". Probably you are interpreting this as "point-norm continuous", i.e., for each $x \in A$ the map $t \mapsto \alpha_t(x)$ is continuous from the group into the norm topology on $A$. The correct definition is that the map $t \mapsto \alpha$ is continuous from the group into the norm topology on ${\rm Aut}(A)$. Indeed, there are no nontrivial norm-continuous representations of connected topological groups on abelian C*-algebras, because the distance between any two automorphisms of an abelian C*-algebra is $2$. Proof: let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be distinct automorphisms. Multiplying both by $\beta^{-1}$, we can assume $\beta = {\rm id}_A$. If $A = C(X)$ then $\alpha$ arises by composition with a non-identity self-homeomorphism $\phi$ of $X$, so find $p \in X$ such that $\phi(p) \neq p$. Then find $f \in C(X)$ with $\|f\|_\infty = 1$, $f(p) = 1$, and $f(\phi(p)) = -1$. Evaluating on this function yields $\|\alpha - {\rm id}_A\| \geq 2$. (The reverse inequality is easy because $\|\alpha\| = \|{\rm id}_A\| = 1$.) 

The invariant subspace problem (ISP) for Hilbert spaces asks whether every bounded linear operator $A$ on $l^2$ (with complex scalars) must have a closed invariant subspace other than $\{0\}$ and $l^2$. A subspace $E$ is invariant for $A$ if $A(E) \subseteq E$. Some time ago I noticed a reformulation that has a set-theoretic flavor. Let $P$ be the set of all linear operators $A$ from a finite-dimensional subspace of $l^2$ into $l^2$ such that (1) $\|A\| < 1$ and (2) if $E$ is a nonzero subspace of the domain of $A$ then $A(E) \not\subseteq E$. Order $P$ by reverse inclusion and for any unit vectors $v,w \in l^2$ define $$D_{v,w} = \{A \in P: \langle A^nv,w\rangle \neq 0\mbox{ for some $n$ such that $A^nv$ is defined}\}.$$ It is easy to see that each $D_{v,w}$ is dense in $P$. Having a counterexample to the ISP is the same as having a filter of $P$ that meets each $D_{v,w}$. My question for the set theory experts on MO is simply whether this version of the problem suggests any possible approaches?
