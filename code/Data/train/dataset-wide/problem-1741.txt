This comment will not answer about the speed of a rocket, because I don't know other factors involving. But this comment will give you energy scales, which you can work on later for the speed of a rocket. I cannot put this comment in the "comment" because it will be too long. Hypernovae (a.k.a. supernovae Ic broad line (SNe Ic-BL) and superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Typical CCSNe are believed to be delayed neutrino-driven explosions, where total explosion energy is $10^{53}$ erg. For typical SNe (i.e., not SNe Ic-BL nor SLSNe), only $\sim 1$% of the total explosion energy is converted into radiation, i.e., $\sim 10^{51}$ erg. SNe Ic-BL and SLSNe radiate $\gtrsim 10^{51} - 10^{52}$ erg, more than those of the typical SNe. Because they are more energetic than $\sim 10^{51}$ erg predicted from typical CCSNe, their explosion mechanisms or energy sources are under debate. Currently, the power from a spinning down magnetar is the most favored candidate. The magnetar spin-down can supply $\sim 10^{52}$ erg, with peak $\lesssim 10^{45}$ erg/s. Talking in term of power, i.e., luminosity, typical SNe has peaks UV/optical/NIR outputs $\lesssim 10^{43}$ erg/s. SNe Ic-BL are about the same scale, but they are more energetic because spectral evidence implies fast moving ejecta. SLSNe are $\gtrsim 10^{44}$ erg/s. To illustrate how powerful these SNe are, we normally compare them to solar radiation $\sim 10^{33}$ erg/s. Note that there are even more powerful explosions predicted such as pair-instability supernovae (PISNe). PISNe can supply $\sim 10^{53}$ erg. But because of very massive ejecta, the peak luminosity is predicted to be comparable to those of SLSNe, but with very long timescale. Some slow-evolving SLSNe are candidates for PISNe. Hope this is helpful for you to use in calculating the speed of a rocket. 

"Maybe I should sum up their luminosity and then, using Stefan Boltzmann law, calculate the temperature? But does the law work for red giants? And can I sum the luminosity?" This answer is not about placing the object on HR diagram, but is about the characteristic temperature as a blackbody. It seems like you have a point source which you know that it is a combination of two stars: one blue, and the other redder. You can apply two-component blackbody: $F_{\lambda,total} = C_1 \times F_{\lambda,1}(T_1) + C_2 \times F_{\lambda,2}(T_2) ; T_1 \ne T_2$ where $F_{\lambda,total}$ is the observed specific fluxes from the point source, $F_{\lambda,1}, F_{\lambda,2}$ are blackbodies with temperature $T_1, T_2$ respectively, $C$s are normalization constants. Blackbody approximately (to the first order) works with stars including red giants as long as you include a portion of the SED where the line absorption/emission is negligible. For example, some stars have strong absorption at less than 4000 A due to metals, therefore that portion deviates significantly from the blackbody. You can sum fluxes, since fluxes are normalized for the luminosity distance. Since luminosity $L$ is $L = F \times 4 \pi D_L^2$ where $D_L$ is the luminosity distance, the total luminosity is $L_1 + L_2 = 4 \pi D_{L,1}^2 \times F_1 + 4 \pi D_{L,2}^2 \times F_2 = C_1 \times F_1 + C_2 \times F_2$. Therefore, you can sum the luminosity when $D_{L,1} \approx D_{L,2}$. 

As depicted by the diagrams you will see that we can see only far away as about 46 Gly (comoving distance), a.k.a. horizon. This is because if we go further than that spot, regarding to the history of universe expansion, we at today will stay out of the spacelike. Note: all the analysis here still assume speed of light as the constant c in any frame of reference. This might be another misunderstanding, but I will not go into details at this moment. 

I think you are talking about color index and temperature. So, I will briefly explain under that circumstance. Color index, e.g., B-V is the difference in brightness (magnitude) of the light observed by filters B and V. (The following discussion can be generalized to other color indeces, e.g., U-B or g-i). Filters B and V have effective wavelengths 4450 (bluer) and V 5510 (redder) A (see Wikipedia), respectively, therefore B-V increases when the object becomes red. (Recall that magnitude is more negative for being brighter). The temperature which is derived from the color index is called "color temperature;" this is different to blackbody temperature, or kinetic temperature, or other types of inferred temperatures (see [this 2). For the color temperature, this is very observational inference. To map from the color index to the color temperature, it is inferred from other well-known object. See Wikipedia for this. Another way to work around is to transform the color index into the flux ratio, then applying the blackbody function as the inference. For example, from B-V >>> flux(4450A)/flux(5510A) >>> blackbody temperature corresponding to the flux ratio. 

I was about to put this in a comment, but it did not let me because it is too long. So, I will just put it here. There is a certain radius from the center of the black hole, where light inside this radius cannot come out, i.e., event horizon. The light that we see is from materials those are spiralling inwards into the black hole, and they are outside the event horizon. These materials experience frictions, therefore they are heated up, and lose their energy into radiation. Black hole can be formed by various mechanisms, according to theories, with or without star explosions (a.k.a. supernovae, SNe). For star-forming black hole, the size, which is typically referred to the zero-age main sequence (a.k.a. ZAMS) mass, is still under debate. But for sure, the star has to be "massive" $> 8$ solar masses in ZAMS. Note that these massive stars might form neutron stars or black holes after the SNe; also the stars might not leave any compact object if the explosions are pair-instability SNe. For a galaxy's black hole, how it is formed is still unknow. One theory is from the accumulation of stuff after SNe, like you said. But, we don't know exactly at this moment, therefore to answer about the "size," I don't think it can be answered. A black hole is just another massive object possessing huge gravitational potential, like our Sun. Therefore, there are orbits those are stable and are not attracted into the center of the potential. 

According to that context, the old light means the light that travelling from far away in order to reach the observer, and vice versa. To determine the age of light, standard method is to use spectral features (absorption/emission but we will talk about the example of emission only without the loss of generality). Let's say that the observer detects a photon which he is very sure that it must be H$\alpha$ emission (i.e., 656.28 nm at rest frame). But, the observer detects a 700.00-nm photon instead of at that rest-rame wavelength. This is because the photon travelling through the universe and experience time dilation; in general, the longer time travelling, the bigger the observed wavelength is, relative to the rest-frame value. Since we have the relationship $\lambda_{rest} * (1 + z) = \lambda_{obs}$ where $\lambda_{rest}$ ($\lambda_{obs}$) is the rest-frame (observe-frame) wavelength, and $z$ is the redshift, we can find the redshift from the known rest-frame and observe-frame wavelengths. Then, the higher redshift means farther away, means older. 

If you want to know about stars, i.e., astronomy or astrophysics, Caroll & Ostlie is somewhat fundamental textbook for undergrad & grad. If you want to know about galaxy and universe, i.e., cosmology, we use the textbook from Ryden. My recommendation is to understand stars first, before you deal with galaxy, and then universe. You will encounter a lot of physics stuff, which you might need to study separately out of just the concepts of astronomy or cosmology, if you want to have deep understanding of the topics. 

It uses the same fundamental conept of mapping between emission-line wavelengths to certain transitions. Similar as we know that 21cm line is the transition of spin-flip of a neutral hydrogen. Infrared (IR) regions is typically where the molecular lines are seen. Wikipedia has good and brief discussion. Asteriods are cold so we expect molecules to form. Therefore, we expect to see lines in IR region the most. To be more specific, surface temperature of asteriod is ~346 K, which is equivalent to ~83714 A at max emission (assuming blackbody radiation and following Wien's law); this is IR. Also note that, what we see is the surface of the asteriod, not the inside. 

For simulation only, you should be able to show it by simple code as following: $$ \vec{a}_t = - \frac{GM}{r_t^2} \hat{r} \\ \vec{v}_{t+1} = \vec{v}_t + \vec{a}_t \Delta t \\ \vec{r}_{t+1} = \vec{r}_t + \vec{v}_t \Delta t $$ where $t$ is time step, $\vec{a}$ is acceleration, $\vec{v}$ is velocity, $\vec{r}$ is position, $\hat{r}$ is a unit vector in radial direction from the origin (set the Sun at the origin), $G$ is gravitational constant, $M$ is Sun mass in this case, and $\Delta t$ is size of time step. You will have to play around with the initial values and step size to get certain orbit representing the case. To make it more real, you derive the initial values from the real parameters, if known.
