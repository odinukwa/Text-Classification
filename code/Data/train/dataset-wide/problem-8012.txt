What is the maximum number of spheres that can be placed in 3D such that all inter-touch? One can of course place four unit spheres tetrahedrally and then add a smaller sphere in the middle, so this number must be at least 5. [By the way, I was trying to extend the "five points in 2D cannot be inter-connected without a crossing" limitation to 3D with a simple statement, but this was sadly the best I could do. If anyone knows a better simple extension, please comment.] 

I assume that this optimization problem is not studied much in math since there was no response to my original post (please see my original version for a few more details though its solution used more steps). So, is there a solution with fewer steps than 13? Better yet, is there any systematic method/theory for finding a minimal 128-bit solution? Notice that I could have asked this problem for any number, like 99 (instead of pi), so I was hoping that there might be some number theory devoted to it. To be clear, in this problem, for each step (e.g., defining x08), you are free to choose two previously-defined variables (e.g., chosen from x01 to x07), their two bitshifts (integers from -infinity to +infinity), and their two inclusion signs (positive or negative). The code above uses # signs to show these six variable columns. 

I believe the current lowest-memory algorithm for computing the $n^{th}$ binary digit of $\pi$ requires $O(log(n))$ bytes and $O(n^2 log(n))$ days (I pick Bellard over Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe for speed). Can any of the common irrational constants be currently computed with the same low memory, but in faster time? Please consider constants which combine integers and $\pi$, natural exponential functions, and/or root functions (e.g., $\pi$, $\pi^2$, $e$, $e^{-\pi}$, $\sqrt2$, $\sqrt{2\pi}$). For any such constant, I am also curious about the randomness in its binary tail. These digit extraction constraints cause correlations in the constant's tail bits which probably go to zero for high $n$ (but, for $\pi$, the Bellard/BBP constraints are too subtle for me to conclude anything). If anyone has a low-memory method to distinguish a tail of some common irrational number from random bits (with the same speed in the limit of high $n$), please comment. 

If an edge $\{x_i, e_x\}$ shows up in a perfect matching of $\hat{G}$, then also an edge $\{y_j, e_y\}$ must show up. This corresponds to have the edge $e = \{x,y\}$ as part of a $d$-factor in $G$. If the edge $\{e_x,e_y\}$ occurs in a perfect matching of $\hat{G}$ this corresponds to the edge $e = \{x,y\}$ not being part of a $d$-factor of $G$. Edit: I was able to track down the references to Tutte's reduction from the article linked in the question. The reduction above is essentially the same as the reduction in Lovász and Plummer's Matching Theory. If one has access to this book see 10.1, the reduction is slightly different because it is done in two steps ($f$-factor to $f$-matching to perfect matching). Figure 10.1.1 on page 386 in a nice example. The original Tutte paper "A short proof of the factor theorem for finite graphs" can be found online. In this paper the reduction is complementary to the one above. If we want a $d$-factor and $v$ is a vertex of degree $d_v$ we create $d_v - d$ vertices. Again each edge is replaced with a length 3 path, but this time selecting to middle edge of the path corresponds to choosing the edge in the matching rather than omitting it. 

An edge between $e_x$ and $e_y$ An edge between $e_x$ and $x_i$ for $ 1 \leq i \leq d$. An edge between $e_y$ and $y_i$ for $ 1 \leq i \leq d$. 

A good reference for all of this is Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra the 2nd Edition by Stanley. First note that a Cohen-Macaulay complex must be pure and also that a shellable complex must be pure. On page 87 of Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra the 2nd Edition Stanley defines sequentially Cohen-Macaulay complexes as a nonpure generalization of Cohen-Macaulay to fit the extension of shellability to nonpure complexes by Bjorner and Wachs found in Shellable Nonpure Complexes and Posets I and II. 

I wish to add an $\epsilon$ to the previous answer. Assume that your symplectic manifold is $T^*M$, where $M$ is a closed manifold, and consider a so called ``Tonelli Hamiltonian´´ $H:T^*M\rightarrow\mathbb R$, which is simply a function which is fiberwise (differentiably) convex and superlinear. Then consider the value $$ c(H)=\min_{u\in C^\infty(M;\mathbb R)} \max_{q\in M} H(q,du_q). $$ This special number in the literature is called ``Mañé critical value´´. Now, if you fix an energy value $h > C(H)$, you can easily build a new Hamiltonian $G$ such that 1) $H^{-1}(h)=G^{-1}(h')$ for some $h'\in\mathbb R$ 2) $G(q,\lambda p)=\lambda^2 G(q,p)$ for each $\lambda>0$ 3) $G$ is fiberwise convex Now, the Legendre dual of the Hamiltonian $G$ will be a Finsler metric (not Riemannian in general). The interesting thing here is that the critical value $c(H)$ can be defined in many other equivalent ways (in terms of Lagrangian action of closed loops, in terms of minimizing invariant measures, etc.). You can find more on this in the book by Contreras and Iturriaga: $URL$ 

Is there any obstruction that prevents a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on some symplectic manifold to be realized as the time-one map of the Hamiltonian flow of an autonomous Hamiltonian? In the same spirit, is there any obstruction that prevents a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism on $T^*M$ (with the canonical symplectic structure) to be realized as the time-one map of the Hamiltonian flow of a Tonelli Hamiltonian (i.e. a Hamiltonian which is fiberwise convex and superlinear)? 

Given a smooth function $f:M\rightarrow \mathbb R$ on a manifold, its local homology at a critical point $x$ is the group $$ C_\star(x) := H_\star ( M_{ < c} \cup \{ x \} , M_{ < c} ) ,$$ where $H_\star$ denotes singular homology (with any coefficient group), $c=f(x)$, and $M_{ < c}$ is the space of those points $x\in M$ such that $f(x) < c$. If $x$ is a non-degenerate critical point, then $C_\star(x)$ is completely determined by the Morse index of $f$ at $x$: the group $C_j(x)$ is equal to the coefficient group of the homology for $j=\mathrm{ind} (x)$, and is trivial for other values of $j$. If $x$ is degenerate, the knowledge of $\mathrm{ind}(x)$ and $\mathrm{nul}(x)$ (this latter being the nullity of $f$ at $x$) is not enough to determine $C_\star (x)$. It is easy to build examples of functions on $\mathbb R^2$ having a critical point $x$ with local homology $C_1(x)= G\oplus ...\oplus G$ ($k$ times, where $k>1$ and $G$ is the coefficient group) and $C_j(x)=0$ for $j\neq 1$. For instance, consider the function $f:\mathbb R^2\rightarrow\mathbb R$ given by $$ f(x,y)=(y-2x^2)(y-x^2)(y+x^2)(y+2x^2). $$ Here, the origin is a critical point whose local homology (say, with $\mathbb Z_2$ coefficients) should be $C_1(0)=\mathbb Z_2\oplus\mathbb Z_2\oplus \mathbb Z_2$ and $C_j(0)=0$ for $j\neq 1$. Does anybody know examples of functions having critical points whose local homology is nonzero in more then one degree? If the answer to the previous question is yes (as I would expect), is it true that given $(n_1,d_1), ..., (n_r,d_r)$ there exists a function $f:M\rightarrow\mathbb R$ with a critical point $x$ whose local homology is given by $C_{d_j}(x)=G^{ \oplus n_j }$ and $C_d(x)=0$ for $d\neq d_1,...,d_r$? 

The OP asks for the densest bipartite graph having a exactly one Hamiltonian cycle. We remark that in Graphs with exactly one Hamiltonian cycle, John Sheehan shows that a graph on $n$ vertices with exactly one Hamiltonian cycle can have at most $\lfloor n^2/4\rfloor + 1$ edges and exhibits a graph $H_n$ achieving this bound. Furthermore the author states $H_n$ in the only graph achieving this bound. We will answer the OP's question by "bipartizing" the argument and construction of Sheehan. Observe that a bipartite graph with a Hamiltonian cycle must have an even number of vertices. Let $G$ be a graph with vertices $\{x_i: 1 \leq 2n\}$ labeled so that $C = x_1x_2\cdots x_{2n}$ is the unique Hamiltonian cycle of $G$. Every edge of $G$ can be regarded as a chord of $C$. We let $C(G;l)$ denote the set of chords in $G$ of length $l$. So, elements of $C(G; l)$ will look like $x_ix_{i+l}$ with incides taken modulo $2n$. If $l > 1$ and $x_i x_{i+l}$ is a chord of $G$, then $x_{i+1} x_{i+l+1}$ cannot be a chord of $G$ otherwise $G$ would have more than one Hamiltonian cycle. This implies $|C(G;l)| \leq n$ for $l > 1$. In fact we can say $|C(G;2l-1)| < n$ for $l > 1$ because if $|C(G;2l-1)| = n$, then $G$ would contain a Hamiltonian cubic subgraph and hence at least three Hamiltonian cycles. Also, we see $|C(G,n)| < n/2$. So far, this is Sheehans's argument. Using the assumption that $G$ is bipartite we see that $|C(G; 2l)| = 0$ for $l > 0$. Let $m$ denote the number of edges of $G$. We compute and see $$m = \sum_{l=1}^n |C(G;l)| \leq n(n+1)/2 + 1.$$ Consider the bipartite graph $G_{2n}$ with vertices $\{x_i : 1 \leq i \leq 2n\}$ and edges $$\{x_i x_{i+1} : 1 \leq i \leq 2n\} \cup \{x_{2i-1}x_{2j} : 2i < 2j < 2n, \; 1 \leq i < n-2\}.$$ Then $G_{2n}$ has $2n$ vertices, $n(n+1)/2 + 1$ edges, and a unique Hamiltonian cycle $C = x_1x_2 \cdots x_{2n}$. We remark graph $G_{2n}$ can be obtained from Sheehan's $H_{2n}$ by deleting the "non-bipartite" edges.
