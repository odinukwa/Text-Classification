A version of the periodic table indicating the main origin of elements found on Earth. The main source of Earth elements above 103 (lawrencium) are manmade and are not included.

Now when a star starts to collapse on itself, this is when the heavy metals start forming from iron and the heavier metals stay closest to the star’s core, such as gold, which is why it is one of the rarest of metals. And a theory also states that since these materials are heavier, the are more likely bound by gravity which increases their escape velocity. However, especially with gold and silver, physicists differ in how these metals are created, what type of star is needed to form them. Many do not give up any of the heaviest of metals. For the longest time, a Supernova was required to produce gold, but a 2013 article in Smithonsian Magazine cites a study where astronomers now think that gold is produced when two neutron stars collide. These stars are the size of a small city but almost twice the density of our Sun. Recently it was discovered that Earth was bombarded with radioactive Iron-60 from several close exploding stars as in this SpaceAnswers.com article. And even this article states that minuscule amounts were deposited on the Earth. So the second thing that occurs when a star does explode, besides scattering its materials in all directions, it does not expel everything. The heavier the metal, the less of it the star will release. You’ll see why when you look at a cross-section of a star just as it is about to explode. So in layman terms, you now know what is ejected from an exploding star, and in order of diminishing quantities. Another factor to consider is that heavier objects will tend to clump, or due to its mass, become gravity bound to each other. So gold will clump together with other gold elements, silver with silver, copper with copper, and so on. As the accretion disk starts to form (it is now known that a supernova explosion does produce all the material to form new stars) this mixture of clumps of metals and dust (that eventually form rocks) will start attracting each other. The problem is distribution out of the supernova. This is why in some areas on Earth you find tons and tons of gold in veins and large chunks, and other places not even a spec. It has to do with the early formation where the elements tend to stay together in clumps. Copper, a more abundant mineral, is found almost all over the Earth, but it too will concentrate in certain areas for the same reason gold does. But because it is a lighter metal, more of it is expelled from the star, and it will concentrate in larger amounts in more places on Earth. Now as the Earth is forming, is is molten. All the heaviest metals will sink deeper into the Earth than the lighter metals, which is why you can find copper very close to the surface, if not on the surface, and you need to dig 1/2 mile or more down to find gold and silver. Same with Iron. It also sinks deep into the center of the Earth. Any planet that forms like Earth will have the same issues with metal distribution. It will not be uniform, as it did not come out of the star that way, and that makes the heaviest of them harder to find. But when you do find a heavy metal like gold or silver, you will find a lot of it concentrated in the area of original discovery. That’s one reason the west had a gold rush, but has anyone heard of a head east young man, gold was found? It was just the luck of the draw where the gold from one or more exploding stars wound up. Yes, our metals are most-likely the product of several exploding Supernovae. There is no way anyone will tell you, looking at a current map of minerals on Earth, that the same locations will hold the same minerals. Many factors determine how much, if any, of the metal is even found on Earth. For example, nickel is natural to Earth, yet most of it is deep inside the Earth. Because it is in many asteroids in our solar system, it is the 5th most abundant element in the Universe, but when found on Earth's crust, it's from asteroid impacts after the Earth cooled. A planet even has a chance to not have any gold in it at all! Take the Moon. While there is gold and silver on the Moon, it has only been detected recently in the ice of the South Pole. Earth is devoid of Helium 3. Yet our Moon, which came from Earth, is loaded with Helium 3. Why? Luck of the draw? Helium 3 comes from the solar winds, which our magnetic field prevents helium 3 from reaching us. If you are looking for a scientific approach, there is no secret formula that says an Earth-like planet will have 10 percent gold, 20 percent silver, 80 percent copper, etc. It does not work like that. The planet Mercury has a lot of iron, the beneficiary of the Sun’s gravity. You would think that heavier metals would be gravitationally attracted to the Sun. Even after all the minerals and metals have been placed on the Earth during its formation from both gathering material from the dust of the accretion disk and bombardments by comets and asteroids, water and wind and other forces over time moves these around. As I said earlier, far more heavier metals made it towards the center of the Earth, but from water to lava flows to plate tectonics, minerals can concentrate around geographic features. Like a miner who looks for quartz to find silver. When you map out your world, you also need to take into consideration these geographic features. For even if the Earth did not receive a certain metal or mineral, chemical reactions can create them over time, like turning carbon into diamonds. Good luck. Placement of metals, removing the laws of physics such as gravity and amounts produced in the Universe, is a crap shot. But make sure that if you place gold or silver or copper that you also place its corresponding geographical features along with it. 

The main problem today with Asia is it has religions that are less tolerating of each other than Catholic, Christians and Judaism. With the People Republic of China (Communist) regime in place, they are currently trying to wipe out the Tibetans. How do you think Muslims would fair under the PRC? I would say that before there is a coalition, there will be a great religious war. Whether Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism just to name a few, most of the religions in Asia come out of India. Once the region does form a coalition, Russia is their wildcard. Russia is both in Europe and Asia. Today, Russia is mostly European, but in the future, they could swing over to the Asian coalition. Russia would be the factor that makes an Asian coalition either weak by its absence or strong by its presence. It also by 2046 could split itself into two countries, one a European and the other an Asian. Whether or not it can curb NATO power (unless something happens before 2046, US is part of NATO) depends on many factors. While the size of the Army is one consideration, history of WWII taught us that the side with better technology acts as a force multiplier. I spent 3 years in the US Army, and I can say that I would kill more with an M-16 than the M1. The M-16 is a greater force multiplier than the M1. WWII saw that when the Germans and Italians with their bolt action Mausers didn't stand a chance with the semi-auto of the M1 Garand, the M-14 and the Thompson Machine gun. However, when Germany improved its machine guns, they started to even out the differences between the force multipliers. If we base the scenario on how population and technology and standing army sizes, just between China and the US, the US is more technically advanced, and it has 81 percent more personnel in the armed services than China does. Russia, while it does have 41 percent more military personnel that the United States, it suffers the same technology fate that China does. Neither have enough aircraft or ships or tanks to outmatch the US, and that isn't adding in what the NATO countries have. This is why Russia is a wildcard. If it joins in with the Asian Coalition, then the differences become smaller as far as number of troops, and the gaps in the differences in assets also close a bit. While I have heard on TV that less people died in the last 100 years than in any other 100 year period going back thousands of years, even by today's most recent number (check the same link will give you the rank of the number of war-time deaths) The NATO coalition with the US will still defeat the Asian Coalition, even with Russia joining them. As someone versed in military strategy, a coalition set up only for defense will find itself outmatched by an adversary with a good attack strategy. The problem with just defense is once key installations are taken out, you have no chance to organize an offensive quickly enough to do anything. Once your military is deaf, dumb and blind, where will you attack? How can you effectively organize your troops? And if you are blind, you'll never see the next attack coming. In your story, the Asian Political and Economic Coalition needs to advance their defensive technology to exceed that of the US/NATO's offensive capabilities. One thing is for sure, this will be one story I can't wait to read. Even with the information provided, the choice of the battleground can negate technology as much as it can enhance it. As the Russian's could not win in Afghanistan due to its technology was no match for the battlefield conditions, it was only the improvements 30 some odd years later that the US had the ability to successfully fight in the same battlefield conditions. Yet it still had great difficulties in fighting, and as of yet has not become victorious. They got much closer than Russia ever did. Good Luck, and I am sure others here will add what I missed. EDIT FOR NUCLEAR ISSUES: Now if this is a nuclear showdown that some think will make the difference, a China/Russia Asia coalition loses. Even 20 years from now. Estimated for 2017: NATO/US Allies - 7,395 US: 6,800 UK: 215 France: 300 Israel: 80 Asia - 7,520 Russia: 7,000 China: 260 North Korea: 10 Pakistan: 140 India: 110 Problem is that Pakistan and India will save many of theirs as they hate each other so bad that they will not let China use them all. Plus, many of the totals above are in the process of being disarmed. North Korea’s program today is a joke, and unlikely to change as their leader in inept. And while it is claimed that North Korea can reach the US, that missile will never reach us. The United States has the best missile defense system in the world. And Russia’s best weapon is fired from a truck. Russia’s nuclear arsenal isn’t as good as it states, according to Jeffrey Lewis of the Arms Control Wonk. Yes, while Russia has a missile that when it enters our atmosphere can fire off 10 warheads at 5 miles per second, they shoot them from trucks. And we have the capability to shoot the missile down while it still is over Russia, which is not a good thing for the Russian people. Also, Russia’s nuclear weapons program is short-sighted. They invest less money in it, because they believe that they will only have to build newer systems every 10 years. Many of their arsenal dates back to just after WWII. While China’s nuclear program is growing, we also have the capability of shooting down all their missiles as the map below shows. China is building islands in the South China Sea for the sole purposes of putting nuclear missiles on them so they can reach the United States. Yet, the US has a secret weapon that no one else has. A autonomous submarine. Yes, launched April of 2016 The Sea Hunt is designed to hunt down submarines, without risking a single crew member’s life. On the NATO side, by 2030, the Germans will have a tank that will make the Russian T14 obsolete. By the time 2046 rolls around, Pakistan will still be at war with India. India has started to engage in talks with the United States after China and Pakistan conducted war games in 2016. We will see a very different Asia by 2046. And while the smaller countries, like Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines will sit out this war, The United States has more airplanes, aircraft carriers, and naval ships to once again own the Pacific. Since Russia nor the United States will fire the first shot, China will at the United States. Russia has no plans to fight against the United States, but while the US amasses in the Pacific and Asia, Russia will use the opportunity to try and take the Baltic. However, NATO is strong enough now to repel any Russian attack, and if Russia succeeds, it will pay a high price for it. And that price means that when Asia calls to Russia for support, it will be unable to do so. We can run scenarios like this for the next 20 years, but due to religious hatred, terrorism, half of the Asian countries do not trust China, China’s first strike might encourage them, but it will also galvanize the world against them, which they will be unable to win.
