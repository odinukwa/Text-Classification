The conventions of a society determine, fix, what is regarded as ethical in that society - to the extent that the society has consensual conventions. These have become rare in the culturally heterogeneous societies of the present day. If there is an objective moral reality, independent of human beliefs, i.e. if moral realism is true, then there are (some) moral truths which are independent of whatever the conventions of any society. These 'truths' may coincide or agree with social conventions but they are no less truths (if you are a moral realist) whether they do or not. Ancient Greek morality cannot be characterised in any single or simple way. Plato held that there is an absolutely objective morality which reflects a realm of values embodied in the Forms, transcendent realities knowable only by and to an intellectual elite. Aristotle's view was that there is an objectively correct way in which for a human being to develop and that this will involve (at least for free adult males) participation in citizenship. On the other hand, sophists such as Thrasymachus, mocked in Plato's Republic, are widely believed to have thought that ethics, morality generally, was a set of beliefs instilled in the 'strongest' to induce obedience to their rule. (Thrasymachus's exact position as depicted in Plato's 'Republic' is actually full of ambiguities and subject still to scholarly dispute.) Glaucon in Plato's 'Republic' is represented as putting forward (not holding) a 'social contract' theory of morality : morality is a set of rules of convenience which we'd all like to break but which are necessary for a safe and organised social life. Even if the ethics of society does in some sense dictate what is ethical - morally right - either makes it actually right (conventionalism) or determines what is merely regarded as right - there is no logical link with majority opinion. Thraysmachus might be correct in holding that morality is decided by the interests of the strongest, who could be a minority, or it might be the case that moral opinions about right and wrong are transmitted by, and inherited from, tradition which the majority like everyone else accept as the guide to ethical behaviour. 

Hume's view is that ideas derive from impressions, meaning roughly and to take an example that I cannot have the idea of blue unless I have had sensory experience (impression) of the colour. The idea is causally dependent on the impression. He doesn't keep strictly to this view in his example of the missing shade of blue. Hume concedes that if we were to have sensory experience of every shade of blue except one, we could imagine - form an idea - of what the missing shade of blue would be like. ('Treatise of Human Nature', 1739-40, I.1.1.) After receiving an impression of blue I can retain the experience in memory; I thus acquire an idea of the colour, blue. There are no innate ideas; all ideas derive from impressions. This is a part of Hume's empiricism. 'Matters of fact' are broadly limited to beliefs about the existence of perceptible objects - chairs, tables, statues, trees and such like. Such beliefs have two features. The first is that we cannot establish them by reason, by logic, but only by perception. The other is that 'the contrary of every matter of fact is still possible; because it can never imply a contradiction' ('Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, 1748, IV.1) The Statue of Liberty exists but it is logically possible for it not to do so. By contrast a triangle cannot exist without its having three sides and three internal angles; a triangle without three sides and three internal angles is in Hume's language a contradiction. Hume never offers an explanation of how external objects, if there are any, cause our impressions to occur, nor does he try to show that there actually are any external objects to cause our impressions. In this sense we can't - or don't - have an impression of the external world but only (at best) an impression caused by an object in the external world. It seems to me that you identify 'matter of fact' with 'external world'. I don't think this is quite right. A matter of fact is a perceptual belief based on our experience of impressions. But you are right (to repeat) that we do not have impressions of anything in the external world. Perhaps there is an external world and perhaps objects in it cause our impressions but of the external world itself we have no impressions. Hume is an extremely elusive writer. There appears to be extreme clarity but on many points it is desperately hard to pin down his exact meaning. However, the above is my considered view about the relation of impressions to matters of fact. I believe it to be correct but as so often with Hume one must be tentative.

This talk of 'material conditions' is poles apart from mechanical materialism. Human beings are thinking, imaginative agents who can plan and imagine beyond the confines of mechanical materialism : 

There are several ways of answering this question - Wittgenstein never makes things easy. I offer the following. Cartesian dualism - or just dualism - draws a distinction between mind and behaviour. The mind thinks or knows; the body acts. We don't need to go into the infinite varieties of behaviourism to see what Wittgenstein's basic thrust against dualism is. On Wittgenstein's account in the 'Brown Book' and later in the 'Philosophical Investigations' is that mind and body are not distinct; there is a logical connection between mind and behaviour. ('Mind' is not a favoured term of Wittgenstein's; he is more apt to refer to 'the mental' but it does not affect the main point here.) First thing to note is that for Wittgenstein it makes sense to ascribe mental phenomena only to beings that can exhibit such phenomena in their behaviour. 'Only of a living human being and what resembles (behaves like) a living human being can one say : it has sensations; it sees; is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious or is unconscious' (PI, ยง281). There is no sense in saying that a plant feels pain since it has no way of manifesting pain in its behaviour. Next up, our mental terms would have different meanings from any they now have if they were not tied to behavioural criteria. For instance if I say of my four-year-old child, 'She can read', I mean not simply that she has a certain mental capacity; I mean that she can behave in certain ways : pick up a newspaper, book or comic and read out the words (behaviour) or tell us what she has read (another form of behaviour). She might choose not to engage in the relevant behaviour but if she really could not do so, 'She can read' would only be true if we changed the meaning of 'read'. In the standard case the mental capacity to read implies some form of behaviour and not just the occurrence of certain private, non-behavioural occurrences 'in' the mind.

Being a Holocaust denier involves denying that the Nazis carried out any large-scale systematic destruction of the Jews. If someone maintains that the Nazis killed 5 million rather than 6 million, whoever put forward the 5 million figure is hardly denying that the Nazis carried out any large-scale systematic destruction of the Jews. It's a non-sequitur at the very least. Crudely, the Holocaust was a deliberate mass killing. You are not denying that it was a deliberate mass killing if you reduce the numbers from 6 million to 5 million. If we regard the Holocaust as involving more than 'mere' numbers and see it (for what it was) as a deliberate attempt to remove the whole Jewish population, it can still have been precisely such a deiberate attempt even if the Nazis actually managed to kill 5 million and not 6 million. 

I think the idea of what is natural, and what unnatural, in ethics stems from beliefs about the proper or normal development of a human being. Such beliefs need a context. Aristotle, for instance, in his 'Politics' and 'Nicomachean Ethics', plainly thinks of a human being as having an inbuilt developmental pattern such that he or she can flourish - enjoy objective well-being - only if a range of virtues or dispositions are possessed and exercised. These are the ethike aretai and the noetikai aretai : moral traits such as courage, justice, self-control, and intellectual traits such as phronesis or practical wisdom. It's important to see that Aristotle regarded a life in which the moral and intellectual virtues were possessed and exercised as the right, the proper, the 'natural' life for a human being, just as natural as an acorn growing into an oak tree. All sorts of assumptions sit behind this view but mainly the idea of there being an authentic pattern of life which, as a matter of fact, human beings have an inbuilt tendency or drive towards and without achieving which they objectively cannot flourish. One of Aristotle's views was that the proper life for a human being involved participation in the self-government of the polis or city-state. He really believed this; political life is 'natural' to a human being, an essential element in a flourishing life : hence his famous phrase that we are 'political animals'. So Aristotle can tell us quite clearly what is unnatural - for one thing, it is life without political participation. A similar view of proper or normal development can be traced in Christianity. A philosopher such as St Thomas Aquinas will tell you that you were born to live in a certain way : to have faith, to worship God, to act charitably towards your neighbour, to forgive offences against yourself, to avoid pride, to see the present world as only a prelude to the perfection of heaven, and so on. All this is presented as the objective essence of a human life - literally what we were created for. To refuse to follow this authentic pattern and model of human life is to deny our God-given nature. It is literally to act unnaturally. When homosexuality is denounced as 'unnnatural' it is usually the Christian model that informs this view though Islam and Judaism also hold that homosexuality is unnatural - as not what the Creator intended in bringing us into existence. You correctly point out that violence and anger are 'natural' urges and that this doesn't make them right. I think what Aquinas would say is that homosexuality can be a 'natural' urge in the sense of being something to which people (some people) are inclined involuntarily but that this does not make homosexuality 'natural' in the sense of being any part of the authentic model and pattern of human life. It is a deviation from what God intended, an imperfection in the individual who is inclined towards it even if the inclination is involuntary. I am not trying to sell Aristotle or Aquinas to you. I just hope I have explained how homosexuality can be both 'natural' in the sense of being involuntary to the individual but 'unnatural', if this is what you think, in the sense of being a deflection from the authentic model and pattern of human life. Both the examples I have used, Aristotle and Aquinas, belong to the Western tradition of thought. Similar examples could be taken from Eastern thought; I have left them out only because I do not have the expertise to discuss them. My own views about homosexuality are neither here nor there. 

It isn't strictly correct to say that he assumed this. His first certainty was 'I think (and thinking), I exist' (Meditation 2). In the more usual form, 'I think, therefore I exist' only has a point-instant certainty. It is true only whenever it is enacted. If X enacts the thought now, and enacts it five minutes later, it does not follow (and Descartes does not think it does) that X has had a continuous existence as an entity between the two enactments. Take a parallel with a clock : whenever it is working it shows the right time. Because it shows the right time on Monday and the right time on Wednesday, it does not follow that the clock has had a continuous existence between the two days. It may have been dismantled on Tuesday and not existed as a clock at all. Descartes argues the case for his being a thinking entity (a continuant). It is may not be a cogent argument but it is an argument, set out in Meditations 2 and 6. โป ILLUSION 

Moral realists believe (very roughly) that there is an independently existing moral reality; that some moral judgements are true by virtue of that reality; and that some moral judgements can be known to be true. (I use the phrase 'by virtue of' in order not to entangle myself in theories of truth; while a moral realist needs a theory of truth, s/he is not committed as a moral realist to a particular theory, e.g. the correspondence theory.) Only such moral judgements are true for a moral realist; subjective judgements, e.g. judgements based purely on emotion or on some intellectual error are either no capable of truth (as perhaps in the case of emotive judgements) or are false (as perhaps in the case of judgements based on intellectual error. I am talking very roughly but this is the essential picture. But now, while subjective judgements are not and cannot be true, they can still be binding. A moral realist can find a role for conscience. If I sincerely believe that X, even if X is not a moral truth, a moral realist can still accept it as a moral truth that I ought to (try to) do X since it is what I sincerely believe I ought to do. There is or need be no inconsistency in this on the part of moral realism. Given the fallibility of human beings, it is reasonable that even error has its rights; and this can itself be a moral fact, true by virtue of an independently existing moral reality. So, I don't think a moral realist can accept that subjective judgements have moral truth exactly, but s/he can recognise as a moral truth that even an erroneous conscience is binding : an agent who is sincere in his or her moral judgement, even if that judgement is subjective, is morally bound or obliged to (try to) act on it.
