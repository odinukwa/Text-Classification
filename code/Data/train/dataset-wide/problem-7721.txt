Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety, $V, W$ closed subschemes in $X$ such that $V \cap W$ is finitely many points. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a line bundle on $X$. Is there any relation between $h^0(\mathcal{L} \otimes_{\mathcal{O}_X} \mathcal{O}_{V.W})$ and the intersection multiplicity of V.W (like is the former bounded by the later)? Is so, can we say anything similar if $\mathcal{L}$ is a locally free sheaf not necessarily of rank $1$? 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field (not necessarily of characteristic $0$), $X$ a non-singular affine closed subscheme in $\mathbb{A}^n_k$ for some $n \ge 2$. Denote by $I_X$ the ideal of $X$ in $\mathbb{A}^n_k$. Let $X'$ be a first order infinitesimal deformation of $X$ i.e., $X'$ is flat over $\mathrm{Spec}(k[t]/(t^2))$ having $X$ as the closed fiber. Denote by $I_{X'}$ the ideal of $X'$ in $\mathbb{A}^n_k \times \mbox{Spec}(k[t]/(t^2))$. By the infinitesimal lifting property, we know that $X'$ is isomorphic to $X \times_k \mbox{Spec}(k[t]/(t^2))$. But this isomorphism is not canonical. The question is whether there is an isomorphism between $X \times_k \mbox{Spec}(k[t]/(t^2))$ and $X'$ such that the induced morphism of ring $$\frac{k[X_1,...,X_n]}{I_X} \otimes_k k[t]/(t^2) \to \frac{(k[t]/(t^2))[X_1,...,X_n]}{I_{X'}}$$ sending $X_i$ to $X_i$? Furthermore, can we get such an isomorphism for which $t$ maps to $t$ as well? 

Take the most simple example $M=\mathbb C$ and $X$ the unit circle. Then $d_X(z)=|z-\frac{z}{|z|}|^2$ is not holomorphic (so as its Laplacian $i\partial \bar \partial( d_X)$), as you can easily see by expanding the expression. 

If you have a morphism $\pi$ with finite generic fiber of cardinal $d$ between compact manifolds, then you have $\pi_* \circ \pi^* = d Id_{H^k(Y,\mathbb Z)}$, where $\pi_* $ is the Gysin morphism. In particular $\pi^*$ is injective. Beside, one can still say something in the case where the generic fiber has positive dimension: if $\pi$ a surjective morphism between compact KÃ¤hler manifolds, then the induced map in cohomology is injective (this is proved in Hodge theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry by Voisin for instance, lemma 7.28 in the french version). 

Let $X$ be a projective scheme and $\pi:\mathcal{Z} \to \mathbb{P}^1$ a surjective morphism of finite type such that for any pair $t_0, t_1 \in \mathbb{P}^1$, the fibers $\mathcal{Z}_{t_0}$ and $\mathcal{Z}_{t_1}$ are rationally equivalent subschemes of $X$. Does this imply $\pi$ is flat? Note here that I am not apriori assuming the rational equivalence of the fibers are coming from $\pi$. 

Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$, $X_K$ a smooth projective curve over $K$. Denote by $\bar{K}$ the algebraic closure of $K$. The base change morphism $X_{\bar{K}} \to X_K$, induces via the pull-back map, a morphism of the Picard groups, $\mbox{Pic}(X_K) \to \mbox{Pic}(X_{\bar{K}})$. Is this map injective? If not true in general, is there a known condition on $K$ under which this holds true? 

On $\mathbb P^1$, there is no non zero holomorphic $1$-form, on any elliptic curves, the holomorphic forms are "constant" (the canonical bundle is trivial), so never vanish if they are not identically zero. As for the other surfaces, namely if $g(X) \geqslant 2$, then $|K_X|$ has no base point (cf Hartshorne, IV, lemma 5.1), which amouts to saying that for all point $x\in X$, there exists a holomorphic form non-vanishing at $x$. Moreover, if $X$ has genus $g\geqslant 2$ as previously and $X$ is not hyperelliptic, then $K_X$ is very ample (cf Hartshorne, IV, proposition 5.2), which means that the linear system given by the (global) holomorphic $1$-forms induces an embedding into $\mathbb P H^0(X, K_X)^* \simeq \mathbb P^{g-1}$. 

Let $C$ be a smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible curve of genus at least $2$ over a complete discrete valued field $F$ of characteristic zero (not necessarily algebraically closed). Let $R$ be the ring of integers of $F$. Assume that the residue field of $R$ is algebraically closed. Does there exist a model of $C$ over $R$ such that the special fiber is irreducible with at worst nodal singularities? I know that by Deligne-Mumford, there always exists a semi-stable model, which only guarentees a reducible curve with at worst nodal singularities, but I am asking if we can do better? 

Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero and $X_K$ a smooth projective curve on $K$. Denote by $\bar{K}$ the algebraic closure of $K$ and $X_{\bar{K}}$ the base change of $X_K$ to $\bar{K}$. Under the natural morphism from $X_{\bar{K}} \to X_K$, we have an induced morphism $\mbox{Pic}^0(X_K) \to \mbox{Pic}^0(X_{\bar{K}})$. Is this morphism surjective? If not true in general, is there any known condition on $K$ under which this holds true? 

I guess your diffeomorphism is a biholomorphism, or at least an holomorphic map, otherwise there is no hope to say much about it. Then the best way to look at these things is using differential forms. Indeed, $\imath \partial \bar{\partial} u =\imath \sum_{i,j} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z_i \partial \bar z_j} dz_i \wedge d\bar z_j$. As is well known, as $\varphi$ is holomorphic (not necessarily bijective), $\varphi^* $ commutes with $\partial$ and $\bar \partial$. Therefore $\imath \partial \bar{\partial} u' = \varphi^* \imath \partial \bar{\partial} u$, which you can translate in terms of matrices then, if you want to: $$Hess(u')_a(\xi)= \underset{j,k,l,m}{\sum} \frac{\partial^2 u(\varphi(a))}{\partial z_l \partial \bar z_m} \frac{\partial \varphi_l(a)}{\partial z_j } \xi_j \overline{\frac{\partial\varphi_m(a)}{\partial z_k } \xi_k} $$ if $\varphi= (\varphi_1, \ldots, \varphi_n)$, and $\xi$ is any tangent vector at $a$. 

Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic and $f:X \to S$ be a smooth, flat, projective morphism between noetherian $k$-schemes. Assume that $S$ is a non-singular quasi-projective variety. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a locally free sheaf on $X$. Fix a polarization $L$ on $X$ and a Hilbert polynomial $P$. Denote by $\mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P$ the relative Quot-scheme parametrizing coherent quotients of $\mathcal{F}$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$. There exists a natural morphism $\pi:\mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P \to S$ and for each point $x \in \mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P$, there exists an induced map between tangent spaces $T_x\pi:T_x\mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P \to T_{\pi(x)}S$. Is it true that for a general (closed) $x \in \mathrm{Quot}_{X/\mathcal{F}/S}^P$, we have $\dim \mathrm{Im}(\pi) \le \mathrm{rk}(T_x\pi)$? Any hint/reference on this topic will be very welcome. N.B. If it helps, one can assume that $X$ is of the form $C \times S$, for a non-singular curve $C$ over $k$ of genus at least $2$ and $f$ is projection onto the second coordinate. 

First of all, the Picard group of a variety is not always monogen, so that the notion of "the ample generator" you are referring to surely concerns a restricted class of varieties. Furthermore, an ample line bundle (or invertible sheaf) is a line bundle $L$ which satisfies any of the following properties : 

Let $X'=X\setminus \overline {D(x,r_x)}$. If $X$ is already hyperbolic, then the answer is yes (there is no entire curves in $X'$). If $X=\mathbb C, \mathbb C^*$, then $X'$ has no entire curves by Picard's little theorem, so it is hyperbolic. If $X=\mathbb C/\Lambda$, then $\pi_1(X')$ is non trivial, and different from $\mathbb Z$ or $\mathbb Z^2$, so $X'$ is hyperbolic. This works if $r_x$ is not too big. Else you could imagine that $X'$ becomes $\mathbb C^*$. If $X$ is $\mathbb P^1$, then your surface is biholomorphic to $\mathbb D$ (it is simply connected and strictly realized inside the complex plane). In conclusion, $X'$ is always hyperbolic.
