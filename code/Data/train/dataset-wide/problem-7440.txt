Depending on how you make that procedure precise, you get various notions. For example, if $X$ is a topological space, "certain scale" means "code by an open cover", and "significant" means "covers X", then you get topological entropy. On the other hand, if $X$ is a measure space, "certain scale" means "code by a partition", and "significant" means "covers a set of uniformly positive measure", then you get measure-theoretic entropy. I'd be interested in knowing if there are other notions of entropy for other sorts of spaces that have analogous definitions. Or for that matter, if there are other notions that don't have analogous definitions. 

The question you ask has been extensively studied in multifractal analysis under the name "conditional variational principle". A quick search for that phrase on MathSciNet turns up an article by Barreira and Saussol in Trans. AMS from 2001. The article by Barreira, Saussol, and Schmeling mentioned in John B's answer also gives a pretty complete account. As Anthony Quas mentions, Kucherenko and Wolf consider similar questions; indeed, there is actually quite a large literature on multifractal analysis (or multifractal formalism) which addresses various questions related to this one. It may be worth noting that even in multifractal papers which do not explicitly formulate a result on maximizing entropy subject to a constraint on $\mu$, such a result is often still implicit. Broadly speaking the story is like this: in multifractal analysis one considers a local asymptotic quantity like the limit of Birkhoff averages $\lim \frac 1n S_n \phi(x)$, puts $K_\alpha$ equal to the set where this quantity exists and is equal to $\alpha$, and then tries to find $h_{\mathrm{top}}(K_\alpha)$ as a function of $\alpha$, where $h_{\mathrm{top}}$ is topological entropy is the sense of Bowen. Often topological entropy is replaced with Hausdorff dimension and the Birkhoff limit is replaced with a pointwise dimension, a local entropy, or a Lyapunov exponent. In any case one often finds that $\alpha \mapsto h_{\mathrm{top}}(K_\alpha)$ is the Legendre transform of the pressure function $t\mapsto P(t\phi)$, and in particular is an analytic function of $\alpha$ in some standard situations where the topological pressure has nice analytic properties. There are basically two approaches to proving that the dependence on $\alpha$ is the Legendre transform of pressure. One approach is to assume some version of the specification property (or some similar uniform mixing condition, such as being a mixing SFT) and then use some orbit-gluing techniques to estimate the size of the sets $K_\alpha$ almost by hand. Another approach is to use thermodynamic results to produce unique equilibrium states $\mu_t$ for $t\phi$ and then argue that each $\mu_t$ is the measure of maximal entropy for some $K_\alpha$ where $\alpha$ depends on $t$, and in particular is the measure you described in your original question. It's entirely possible that the procedure I just described is well known to you; my point is just that such procedures were done even before the 2001 paper of Barreira and Saussol, so this is quite a well-established idea. I believe I've seen the conditional variational principle discussed explicitly in papers by Gelfert and Rams, also by Johannson, Jordan, Ã–berg, and Pollicott. At some point I wrote a survey of multifractal analysis that discusses this issue in Section 2.3; it also appears in Proposition 2.9 and Theorem C of another paper of mine. Perhaps I've gotten long-winded and just told you some things you already knew. To more specifically address your main questions... "Is the answer to the above question known?" Yes, it is pretty well-known and studied, the keywords being "multifractal formalism" and "conditional variational principle". "If yes, could you give a reference?" The references given by others to Kucherenko-Wolf and Barreira-Saussol-Schmeling will do -- my preference would be Barreira-Saussol 2001 since it is earlier -- but I would point out that the techniques used are pretty standard in multifractal work going even further back (Pesin-Weiss 1997, probably earlier as well). "How difficult is it?" In the generality you formulated I do not believe it is particularly dialfficult; one can consider the unique equilibrium states $\mu_t$ for $t\phi$ as $t$ ranges over $\mathbb{R}$ and then make some general arguments (if this is what you do then I apologize for telling you things you know). The same technique works more generally as long as you can say enough about the uniqueness of the equilibrium states, but this can be a challenging question in general.

Weyl's equidistribution theorem states that the orbit of a point on the circle under rotation by $\alpha$ becomes asymptotically equidistributed with respect to Lebesgue (Haar) measure whenever $\alpha$ is an irrational multiple of $\pi$. (From the dynamical point of view, this is the statement that irrational rotations are uniquely ergodic.) What happens if we choose two angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ and flip a coin at each step to determine which we rotate by? Does the orbit still equidistribute? Here is a more precise statement of the question, since the above is terse and perhaps open to misinterpretation. Let $\Omega =\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ be the space of infinite sequences of 0s and 1s, endowed with the $(\frac 12, \frac 12)$-Bernoulli measure $\mu$. Consider the circle $S^1 = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ and a starting point $x_1\in S^1$. Fix $\alpha_0,\alpha_1\in \mathbb{R} / \mathbb{Z}$. Given $\omega\in \Omega$, define a sequence $x_n(\omega)\in S^1$ iteratively by $x_{n+1} = x_n + \alpha_{\omega(n)}$. Let $m_n(\omega) = \frac 1n \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \delta_{x_k(\omega)}$ be the average of the $\delta$-measures at the points $x_1(\omega),\dots, x_n(\omega)$. Let $E\subset \Omega$ be the set of $\omega$ such that $m_n(\omega) \to $ Lebesgue. Note that $\omega\in E$ if and only if $\sigma\omega\in E$, where $\sigma$ is the shift map on $\Omega$, and thus by the ergodic theorem we have $\mu(E)=0$ or $\mu(E)=1$. Questions: 

I'm trying to understand how $E(X^2)$ (or equivalently, $\mathop{Var}(X)$) depends on $J$ and $\mu$. In the case where $J=\mathbb{N}$ the standard results show that $p=\frac 1\mu$ and so $E(X^2) = \mu^2(2-\frac 1\mu)$. I'm interested in the case where $\mu$ becomes very large and would like to obtain a similar estimate $E(X^2) \approx A\mu^2$, for some constant $A>1$, in a more general setting. The example I'm working with at the moment is $J= \{2^n \mid n\in \mathbb{N}\}$, but ideally I'd like some conditions on the set $J$ that would guarantee an estimate of the above form. Is there a standard name for these distributions, or a reference where I can read more about them? Are estimates of this form known? Edit: As Brendan McKay pointed out below, this boils down to understanding the behaviour of the function $g(\gamma) = \sum_{j\in J} \gamma^j$, and in fact the issue that motivated the question I posed can be stated more directly in terms of this function. The condition $E(X) = \mu$ is equivalent to the equation $\mu = \gamma g'(\gamma) / g(\gamma)$, which determines $\gamma$ implicitly as a function of $\mu$. We would like to understand how $g(\gamma)$ grows as $\mu\to\infty$, and hence $\gamma\to 1$. (In particular, this means we're really interested in the case where $J$ is infinite.) In the case $J=\mathbb{N}$, one has $g(\gamma) = \frac\gamma{1-\gamma} = 1 - \frac 1{1-\gamma}$, and so $\mu = \gamma (\frac{\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}) (\frac{1-\gamma}\gamma) = \frac{\gamma}{1-\gamma}$, so that in fact $g(\gamma(\mu)) = \mu$ and the two quantities go to infinity together. In the more general case a reasonably simple argument shows that $\lim_{\mu\to\infty} g(\gamma(\mu)) = \infty$ provided $J$ is infinite, but it's not at all clear to me how the rate at which $g$ grows (in terms of $\mu$) depends on $J$ for more general sets. That's the original motivation -- after some messing around we decided that we could figure out the growth rate if we knew something about $E(X^2)$ as suggested above, and since it was phrased in terms of what seemed to be a reasonably natural probability distribution, we decided to ask it in that form. But now you have the whole story... 

One relatively straightforward way is to use cone families. First, note that by passing to an adapted metric it is possible to assume that $C=1$. (This is a standard argument whose details should appear in the texts you are reading.) In particular, you have the one-step expansion properties $\|Df(v^u)\| \geq \lambda^{-1}\|v^u\|$ and $\|Df(v^s)\|\leq \lambda \|v^s\|$ for every $v^{u,s}\in E^{u,s}_x$. Next, note that the hyperbolicity conditions on $\Lambda$ imply the existence of invariant cone families $K^{u,s}_x$. These can be defined by fixing $\gamma>0$ and putting $K^u_x = \{ v^u + v^s \mid v^{u,s} \in E^{u,s}_x, \|v^s\| < \gamma \|v^u\|\}$, and similarly for $K^s_x$ with the roles of $u,s$ reversed. A direct computation using the one-step expansion properties above shows that if $\gamma$ is chosen sufficiently small, then $\overline{Df(K_x^u)} \subset K_{f(x)}^u$ and $\overline{Df^{-1}(K_x^s)} \subset K_{f^{-1}(x)}^s$ for $x\in \Lambda$ and that moreover the one-step expansion holds for all $v^{u,s}\in K_x^{u,s}$ if $\lambda$ is replaced by some $\lambda'\in (\lambda,1)$. It is straightforward to see that the existence of cones with the above properties is an open condition: given that the above conditions hold for $K_x^{u,s}$ with $x\in \Lambda$, extend the cones continuously to $x$ in a neighbourhood of $\Lambda$, and for a sufficiently small neighbourhood this continuous extension will have the same property because each of the properties above is stable under small perturbations. Now once you have the cones on a neighbourhood $U$, you just need to get invariant subspaces $E^{u,s}_x \subset K^{u,s}_x$, and everything follows. Let's do $E^s$: the case $E^u$ is similar. Let $J = \{n\geq 0 \mid f^n(x)\in U\}$, and define $E_x^s$ to be any subspace of the appropriate dimension contained in the intersection $\bigcap_{n\in J} Df^{-n}(\overline{K_{f^nx}^s})$. Note that the sets in the intersection are compact and nested, so the intersection is nonempty even if $J=\mathbb{N}$. Take a similar intersection with $n\leq 0$ to define $E_x^u$. Edit: Here is a clarification of how to extend the cones to a neighbourhood. Let $\tilde U$ be a small neighbourhood of some part of the attractor $\Lambda$ -- in particular, assume $\tilde U$ is small enough so that the tangent bundle $T\tilde U$ is homeomorphic to $\tilde U \times \mathbb{R}^d$. Then the subspaces $E_x^u$ on $\Lambda \cap \tilde U$ are given by a continuous function $\Lambda \cap \tilde U \to (\mathbb{R}^d)^u$, where $u$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace -- this function takes $x$ to a set of $u$ vectors forming a basis for $E_x^u$. By the Tietze extension theorem, this can be extended continuously to the neighbourhood $\tilde U$. The procedure for $E_x^s$ is analogous. This gives an extension of $E_x^{u,s}$, and hence $K_x^{u,s}$, to $\tilde U$. Cover $\Lambda$ with finitely many such neighbourhoods, enumerate them as $\tilde U_i$ for $i=1,\dots, n$, and extend first to $\tilde U_1$, then $\tilde U_2$, and so on. This describes how to extend the cones. For the claim that the conditions on the cones extend, the key tool is the topological fact that if $\phi\colon X\to Y$ is continuous and $X'\subset X, Y'\subset Y$ are closed sets such that $\phi(X')\subset Y'$, then for every open set $Z\supset Y'$, there is an open set $V\supset X'$ such that $\phi(V) \subset Z$. First we use this to get the expansion/contraction condition. Let $\chi(x) = \sup\{ \|Df_x(v)\| \mid v\in K_x^s, \|v\|=1\}$. Note that $\chi$ is continuous on $U$ and $\chi(x)\leq \lambda'$ for all $x\in \Lambda$. Thus for all $\lambda''\in (\lambda', 1)$, there is a neighbourhood $\hat U \subset U$ of $\Lambda$ such that $\chi(x) \leq \lambda''$ for all $x\in \hat U$. Expansion properties for $K_x^u$ follow similarly. Finally, invariance. Extend $E_x^{u,s}$ as described above. Given $x\in U$ and $\gamma>0$ Let $K_x^u(\gamma)$ be the cone around $E_x^u$ of width $\gamma$, as in the second paragraph. Then on $\Lambda$, uniform expansion/contraction together with invariance of $E_x^{u,s}$ shows that there are $0<\gamma'<\gamma$ such that $Df(K_x^u(\gamma)) \subset K_{fx}^u(\gamma')$ for all $x\in \Lambda$. Because $Df$ and $x\mapsto K_x^u$ are continuous, and because $K_{fx}^u(\gamma)$ contains a neighbourhood of $K_{fx}^u(\gamma')$, the topological lemma shows that $\overline{Df(K_x^u(\gamma))} \subset K_{fx}^u(\gamma)$ for all $x$ in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of $\Lambda$. The invariance property for $K_x^s$ is similar. 

If $p<1$ and $X$ is a random variable distributed according to the geometric distribution $P(X = k) = p (1-p)^{k-1}$ for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$, then it is easy to show that $E(X) = \frac 1p$, $\mathop{Var}(X)=\frac{1-p}{p^2}$ and $E(X^2) = \frac{2-p}{p^2}$. Now consider a "conditional" geometric distribution, defined as follows (if there is standard terminology for this, let me know and I'll call it that): 

A fundamental construction in a first course on manifolds is to build a smooth function $\psi\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with the property that for some $0<\delta<\epsilon$ we have 

If $X$ is a compact metric space and $\mu$ is a Borel probability measure on $X$, then the space $C(X)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $X$ is a closed nowhere dense subset of $L^\infty(X,\mu)$, and hence bounded measurable functions are generically discontinuous. Nevertheless, Luzin's theorem says that every measurable function is in fact continuous on a set of arbitrarily large measure. This allows us to gain continuity from measurability at the cost of ignoring a small portion of $X$. Question: Are there any analogues of Luzin's theorem that allow us to go from continuity to HÃ¶lder continuity? A direct analogue would be a statement that given a continuous function $f\in C(X)$ and an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$, there exists a set $X_\epsilon \subset X$ such that $\mu(X_\epsilon) > 1-\epsilon$ and the restriction of $f$ to $X_\epsilon$ is HÃ¶lder continuous. (For my purposes, it would be all right if the HÃ¶lder exponent and coefficient become arbitrarily bad as $\epsilon\to 0$.) Another possible analogue, and one that I am actually more interested in, would be a statement that given a continuous function $f\in C(X)$ and an arbitrary $\epsilon>0$, there exists a set $X_\epsilon \subset X$ such that the restriction of $f$ to $X_\epsilon$ is HÃ¶lder continuous (again with arbitrarily bad exponent and coefficient) and instead of an estimate on the measure of $X_\epsilon$, we have $$ \dim_H(X_\epsilon) > \dim_H(X) - \epsilon, $$ where $\dim_H$ is Hausdorff dimension. Full motivation: Ideally I would like to consider the setting where $T\colon X\to X$ is a continuous map, and obtain a similar statement about the restriction of a continuous potential $f\in C(X)$ to a set of large topological pressure, $$ P_{X_\epsilon}(f) > P_X(f) - \epsilon, $$ such that $f$ restricted to $X_\epsilon$ has the Walters property, which deals with variation on Bowen balls rather than on metric balls. But the purely static version stated above for Hausdorff dimension seems like a good place to start. Does anybody know of any results in this direction? Or counterexamples showing that such a theorem can't be true in full generality? Edit: I've accepted Anonymous's answer, which shows quite nicely that the direct analogue (using measures) fails. However, I remain very interested in the indirect analogue (using dimensions), which seems to still have a chance of holding, so any information in that direction would be welcomed. 

I know that's rather broad and open-ended. I'd be quite happy (at first, at least) with an answer to the first question. It seems worth asking all of them since this feels like something that has been probably been studied and may be well understood, although I didn't find anything when I looked. (I found some related results, but nothing that addressed these particular questions.) 

all the Lyapunov exponents of $\mu$ are non-zero ($\mu$ is a hyperbolic measure), and at least one is positive; moreover, there is a set of points $G_\mu\subset M$ such that $G_\mu$ has positive volume (with respect to the Lebesgue measure induced by a Riemannian structure compatible with the smooth structure of $M$) and every $x\in G_\mu$ is generic for $\mu$, meaning that it satisfies the conclusion of the Birkhoff ergodic theorem for every continuous observable $\phi$. 

The Margulis-Ruelle inequality states that measure-theoretic entropy is controlled by Lyapunov exponents; more precisely, if $f$ is a $C^{1+\alpha}$ diffeomorphism on a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ and $\mu$ is a Borel $f$-invariant ergodic probability measure with Lyapunov exponents $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_d$, then $h_\mu(f) \leq \sum_{\lambda_i>0} \lambda_i$. This also holds for non-invertible $C^1$ interval maps: we have $h_\mu(f) \leq \max(0,\lambda(\mu))$, where $\lambda(\mu) = \int \log|f'(x)|\\,d\mu(x)$. (See, for example, Proposition 4.1 of [Ledrappier, Some properties of absolutely continuous invariant measures on an interval, Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems 1 (1981), 77-93].) Question: Has this result been proved for piecewise $C^1$ interval maps? I would be surprised if it is not true in this setting, but neither I nor anyone I've asked has been able to produce a reference to a proof in the case where $f$ is a piecewise monotonic interval map without any assumption of Markov structure. 

There's a lot of literature on this question, the keywords are "cohomological equation" and "Livsic theorem". I don't have the references handy at the moment, but the main idea is that if the system is Anosov and periodic obstructions vanish, then you get extra regularity in the solution to the cohomological equation. Namely, if your data (the function w) is Holder then so is the solution v. On the other hand, without any hyperbolic properties there's no reason to expect a continuous solution, or even an integrable one. Let T be an irrational rotation and w be constant and nonzero. There are no periodic points, so that condition is vacuously satisfied, but clearly there's no integrable solution to the cohomological equation, otherwise w would have zero integral, since Lebesgue measure is invariant. 

This is an important and interesting question; unfortunately it's very hard to say anything in much generality. First one needs to establish within which class of dynamical systems the question is being asked, and then to establish a notion of "largeness" within that class. Cardinality is not the most useful because whatever precise definition of "system" and "chaotic" we settle on, both classes are likely to be uncountable. So we may try to impose a measure on the space of systems, and ask if a positive measure set (or full measure set) of systems are chaotic. (Again, deferring for the moment the question of just what chaotic means.) Or we may ask whether the set of chaotic systems is residual (countable intersection of open dense sets), so that a topologically generic system is chaotic. One immediate difficulty is that the space of systems is infinite-dimensional. More precisely, if "dynamical system" means "diffeomorphism of a given manifold", then it's not clear what measure to use on the space of systems. There are notions of prevalence that address this issue, but I won't go into them here. We still haven't said what chaotic means. Let's agree that a dynamical system is a smooth map $f$ from some manifold $M$ to itself, and that chaotic means "$f$ has a physical measure with non-zero Lyapunov exponents". This means that there is an $f$-invariant probability measure $\mu$ on $M$ such that
