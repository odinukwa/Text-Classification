Yes. Let $K \subset \mathbb{C}$ be a number field that is closed under complex conjugation (not necessarily Galois). Modulo the roots of unity, the group of unitary units in $K$ is free of rank equal to the number of infinite primes of $K$ minus the number of infinite primes of the real subfield $K \cap \mathbb{R}$. Recall that the number of infinite primes of a field is the number of real embeddings + half the number of complex embeddings. This is proved nicely in this paper by Daileda. Note that $K$ and its real subfield have the same number of infinite places iff either $K$ is totally real or $K$ is CM (meaning a totally imaginary quadratic extension of a totally real field). So for precisely these cases, the only unitary units in $K$ are roots of unity. 

It sounds to me that you need to detect the tempo of the music, and not the pitch. If you are trying to use a pitch-detection algorithms, then these are going to fluctuate rapidly, as they will lock onto the high frequences in your music. It sounds like you need something that filters out all but the lowest frequencies and allows you to determine how many BPM (beat per minute) the music is, as well as the phase of the beat also, so that you can do beatmatching as you originally mention. However, I don't think that anyone here is going to be able to give you a simple formula for doing this directly from the samples. Digital signal processing is, by its very nature, a fairly mathematical subject. I do think that if you try Googling for "beat-matching signal-processing", or "beat-matching matlab", you will be pointed in the right direction, as you might find a published algorithm for doing exactly what you need. For instance, I found the following paper by searching: Design of an Automatic Beat-Matching Algorithm for Portable Media Devices. It might be worth looking at if you can get it without paying, say through a university with a subscription. Otherwise, I'm sure there are 100's of similar papers you can find on this subject. Also, many universities teach an audio signal processing class, and often the notes from these classes are online. Beat-matching is a common project for students to try in such classes and I'm sure you will be able to find some examples where people have done it. Sorry I couldn't give you more explicit advice, but I hope I understood your question correctly and have pointed you in the right direction. Good luck. 

None of the other obvious statistics that describe this map are in the OEIS yet. Here are naive python implementations of $B_L, B_R, B_L^{-1}, B_R^{-1}$ if you want to check these assertions. 

I doubt there's a completely standard definition. It seems like this is elementary -- an undirected edge is a size-$k$ subset of $[1,n]$, and a directed edge is an undirected edge together with one of the possible $2^k$ labellings of it with "T" and "H". So the number of different edges is (if, say, empty head- and tail-sets are allowed) $\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} 2^k = 3^n$ Presumably a directed hypergraph consists of any collection of such edges, so there are $2^{3^n}$ of them. If this isn't the precise question you were wondering about, I'd wager that the one you're interested in is just as easy to count. 

This is an answer, but my insight is hardly a mathematical one. Nonetheless, here we go: The 1955 paper of Turán is, in fact, published in both English and Chinese in the same journal. The Chinese version is pages 411-417 in the journal; the English language version is pages 417 - 423. Turán writes: "I am pretty sure that on the way one can evaluate $M_n(6)$ or $S_n(6)$ after a little longer calculations and also further." But he doesn't give a formula. 

Propp redoes, clarifies and generalizes domino shuffling in the following lovely paper: Propp, James. "Generalized domino-shuffling." Theoretical Computer Science 303, no. 2 (2003): 267-301. $URL$ The redone explanation is a way of thinking of the domino shuffle map locally, using a graph transformation called urban renewal; these days people also call it the spider move. The move replaces a 4-cycle in a graph (the "square", we might call it) with an 8-vertex graph made of a 4-cycle with a pendant edge on each vertex (the "spider"); the feet of the spider get attached where the vertices of the square were. Spider moves, when combined with a suitable reweighting of the edges in the graph, preserve the generating function for perfect matchings up to an explicit constant. The argument is much like the one in Elkies-Kuperberg-Larsen-Propp which you're asking about, but it is substantially streamlined because you only have to think about the square and the spider. In answer to your question: once you understand this point of view, odd-deficiency is obvious. When you reconstruct the domino shuffle using spider moves (which Propp explains how to do in the same paper), the squares and the spiders comprise the odd blocks, and all the action happens within them. The even blocks do not enter into the picture at all. As further evidence that the spider move is the correct point of view, Kenyon-Goncharov $URL$ recently used the spider move to define a certain cluster integrable system for the dimer model. 

Let $X$ be a complex irreducible quasi-projective variety, $f:X\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}^N$ a morphism, $H\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ a hyperplane, $Z:=f^{-1}(H)$ which is irreducible, $Y\subset X$ a irriducible closed subset. Clearly we have $f(Y)\cap H=f(Y\cap Z)$, is it true that $\overline{f(Y)}\cap H=\overline{f(Y\cap Z)}$? EDIT: Moreover $Y\cap Z$ is irreducible (hence not empty). Thanks. 

Hello all. Let $X_{p_0,\ldots,p_n}\subset\mathbb{P}^N=\mathbb{P}^N_{\mathbb{C}}$ be the sequence of blowing-ups $\pi:\mathrm{Bl}_{p_0,\ldots,p_n}\longrightarrow\mathbb{P}^n$ along $n+1$ points of $\mathbb{P}^n$ (maybe infinitely near points), embedded by very ample divisor $H_X\sim d\pi^{\ast}(H_{\mathbb{P}^4})-E_1-\cdots - E_n$ ($E_1,\ldots,E_n$ the exceptional divisors, $H_{\mathbb{P}^4}\in|\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^4}(1)|$, $d\geq 1$). If $p_0' ,\ldots, p_n'$ is another list of $n+1$ points that produces $X_{p_0',\ldots,p_n'}$ as above, is true that $X_{p_0,\ldots,p_n}, X_{p_0',\ldots,p_n'}$ are projectively equivalent ? Thanks. 

Let $L=\mathbb{P}^l\subset\mathbb{P} ^ N _ {\mathbb{C}}$ be a linear space and let $M=\mathbb{P}^{N-l-1}$ be a linear space skew to $L$, i.e. $L\cap M=\emptyset$. Let $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^N_{\mathbb{C}}$ be a closed irreducible variety not contained in $L$ and let $$ \pi_L:X\dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^{N-l-1}=M $$ be the linear projection, i.e. the rational map defined on $X\setminus L$ by $$ \pi_L(x)=\langle L,x\rangle\cap M.$$ Let $x\in X\setminus L$ a point. Is true that if $\overline{\pi_L(X)}$ and $\overline{\pi_L^{-1}(\pi_L(x))}$ are smooth varieties, then $X$ is smooth at $x$? Thanks. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P} _{\mathbb{C}}^N$ be a normal complete intersection. $X$ is called factorial if every Weil divisor on it is Cartier; equivalently if all local rings $\mathcal{O}_{X,x}$ are unique factorization domains. Is it true that if $$ \dim(\mathrm{sing}(X))<\dim(X)-3, $$ then $X$ is factorial? Thanks. 

Hi. Let $f,g:X\dashrightarrow\mathbb{P}^N$ be two rational maps from a complex smooth irreducible projective variety $X$ to a projective space. Suppose that for every general point $x\in X$ we have $\overline{f^{-1}(f(x))}=\overline{g^{-1}(g(x))}$. Is true that $\overline{f(X)}$ and $\overline{g(X)}$ are isomorphic (resp. projectively equivalent) ? If not, is true that $\overline{f(X)}$ is smooth if and only if $\overline{g(X)}$ is smooth? Thanks. 

Archimedes might have tried to bound the arclength of the $i$th whorl of the spiral between the circumferences of two circles (of radii $ki$ and $k(i+1)$). If you consistently take, say, the lower bound, or the upper bound, or any sensible weighted average of the two, then you're adding a constant amount of arclength with each whorl. The particle can traverse this extra length in the same time by accelerating uniformly. Of course, this isn't completely accurate, as mentioned by Aaron Meyerowitz in the comments. But as the angle between the tangent vectors to the spiral and to the circle decreases, the error approaches zero. Archimedes was fairly comfortable handling the error intuitively in limiting arguments like this, as far as I know. But this is a boring story. I prefer to imagine that one day Archmedes carefully cut an unrolled papyrus scroll in half along one of its diagonals (either on a whim, or out of frustration with the math that he'd been trying to write on it). When the halves are rolled back up, they're approximately parabolic in cross-section. He would have instantly recognized the parabola, after all that time he spent cutting cones in half. I don't know whether Archimedes knew that the parabola is the curve of constant acceleration, though. 

You probably know the following already. Oh, well. Anyway, Eric Nordenstam and I answered exactly this problem. It is a special case of Theorem 1 in our preprint, $URL$ and it also appears in the proceedings of FPSAC 2012. Our method was inspired (and suggested) by Krattenthaler: We guessed the answer from empirical data, and then proved our guess was right by multiplying the matrices out and confirming that the answer was the identity matrix. 

Actually, I think the channel is not extremal because I suspect you are misquoting the Landau-Streater result. So I will state it here. To be precise, for anyone unfamiliar with the field, a quantum channel is a trace-preserving, completely-positive linear map on density matrices (positive semidefinite matrices with unit trace), of potentially different sizes. A basic theorem in quantum information says that every quantum channel from $m\times m$-dimensional to $n\times n$-dimensional density matrices can be written in Kraus form: $$ \rho \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^N A_i \rho A_i^\dagger, \text{ for linear operators } A_k \colon \mathbb{C}^m \to \mathbb{C}^n \text{ satisfying } \sum_k A_k^\dagger A_k = I_m. $$ It is easy to show that the set of quantum channels between systems of fixed dimension is convex. It also easy to show that the set of channels that map $\frac{1}{m} I_m$ to a fixed density matrix $\sigma$ is convex. Now the theorem of Landau-Streater says that if $m = n$, a channel with Kraus form as above is extremal in this latter set if and only if the $N^2$ linear operators $A_i^\dagger A_j \oplus A_j A^\dagger_i$ (of size $2m \times 2m$) are linearly independent. It seems you have instead been working with $m\times m$ matrices. But I think that even if you were to continue and apply the theorem correctly, you would only prove or disprove extremality in the convex subset of unital channels, i.e. those for which $\frac 1m I$ is a fixed point. So potentially you could strengthen Ben-Or's conclusion by showing non-extremality in this subset, or otherwise you might conclude extremality there, which would tell you nothing about extremality in the entire set of channels. 

What roots of unity can be contained in the abelian extensions of an imaginary quadratic number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-d})$? In particular, I would like to know: 

I think it's a typo. It's probably rather more common than other typos, because the letters "t,h,g" are very close to each other on a standard keyboard. As a result, it actually does appear in the literature rather more often than you'd expect, and always without definition. (As such, I believe this post qualifies as a legitimate research question and shouldn't be closed, despite the fact that it's about a trivial typographical error. Hilarious!) For instance, here it is in a google books search result. It appears in the second page of an article in a collection of proceedings of a conference, without any definition. Elsewhere in the article it seems to be talking about orthogonality. Of course I'd be happy to be proven wrong - probably the best thing to do is to contact someone who's used the word in print. Maybe they know what it means. Edit: More evidence: compare the title to that of the pdf link, Also this: where the previous sentence uses the word "orthogonal") 

You could symmetrize an arbitrary function by averaging it over the symmetric group. Explicitly: take your favourite function $h$ in $n$ variables, and set $f(r_1, ..., r_n) = \frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\sigma} h(r_{\sigma(1)}, ..., r_{\sigma(n)})$ where the sum is taken over all permutations $\sigma$ of the numbers $1,...,n$. I'd love to hear of an example which isn't obtained by symmetrization! edit: heh. Any such example would be its own symmetrization. So I guess in some sense this is a complete, if overly glib, answer. 

Alexander the Great is staring at the Gordian Knot, bewildered. Absentmindedly he fingers the hilt of his trusty sword. On the sword is inscribed the words: "Change the order of summation". Mathematics is full of multiple-sum computations in which the crucial step is to change the order of summation. Unlike Alexander, though, I often see no conceputally clear reason why it ought to make the answer fall out. It is so unreasonably effective that I am tempted to do it without even thinking. Is there some unifying reason why one should try changing the order of summation? Or, to put it another way, maybe this is confirmation bias talking. Are there interesting computations where it's possible to change the order of summation, but the correct approach is not to change it? 

Let $\mathbb{F}_1$ be the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal{O}\oplus\mathcal{O}(-1))$ and let $D$ be the very ample divisor $3C_0+5f$ on $\mathbb{F}_1$ (notation as in [Hartshorne, Algebraic geometry, p. 373]). Then $|D|$ gives an embedding of $\mathbb{F}_1$ in $\mathbb{P}^{17}$ as a surface of degree $21$. How do I find the equations of this surface (using for example Macaulay2)? Thanks. 

Let $X,Y$ be complex projective varieties with $X$ irreducible, and let $f:X\dashrightarrow Y$ be a rational map. If $U\subseteq X$ is the largest open set where $f$ can be defined, is it true that $\mathrm{codim}_{X}(X\setminus U)\geq 2$. I know this is true if $X$ is smooth. EDIT: In view of the inkspot's answer, I add: if $D\subset X$ is an irreducible divisor on $X$, with $D\cap\left(X\setminus\mathrm{sing}(X)\right)\neq\emptyset$, can it happen that $D\cap U=\emptyset$? Thanks. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P} ^ N$ be a smooth irreducible complex projective variety of dimension 3 (or better yet, dimension $n$). Is it possible to express the Hilbert polynomial of $X$ as a function of the degrees of Segre classes of $X$? If so, how? Thanks. 

Let $X\subset\mathbb{P}^N$ be an irreducible nondegenerate (i.e. not contained in a hyperplane) projective complex algebraic variety, and let $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ be the secant variety of $X$ (i.e. the union of all secant lines of $X$). Further suppose that the homogeneous ideal of $X$ is generated by forms $F_1,\ldots,F_m$ of degree two. How do I write the equations of $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ as a function of $F_0,\ldots,F_m$ ? Let us focus attention on the simplest case, i.e. when $\mathrm{Sec}(X)$ is a cubic hypersurface. Then we have $\mathrm{Sec}(X)=V(G(x_0,\ldots,x_N))$, where $G(x_0,\ldots,x_N)=\sum_{i=1}^m L_i(x_0,\ldots,x_N) F_i(x_0,\ldots,x_N)$. The linear forms $L_0,\ldots,L_N$ depend only by $F_0,\ldots,F_N$, but how? Thanks. 

Let $X$ be an irreducible, generically smooth, closed subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^N=\mathbb{P}^N_ {\mathbb{C}}$ with saturated ideal $I_{X,\mathbb{P}^N}$ generated by quadrics, and let $\widetilde{\mathbb{P}^N}=\mathrm{Bl}_{X}(\mathbb{P}^N)\stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow}\mathbb{P}^N $ be the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^N$ along $X$, $E=V( f^{-1}(\mathcal{I} _{X,\mathbb{P}^N})\cdot \mathcal{O} _{\widetilde{\mathbb{P}^N}})$ the exceptional divisor. Also let $Q\in I_{X,\mathbb{P}^N}$ be a fixed smooth quadric, $\widetilde{Q}=\mathrm{Bl}_{X}(Q)$ the strict transform of $Q$, $F=E\cap \widetilde{Q}$ the exceptional divisor. Moreover assume $\widetilde{Q}$ smooth and $F$ reduced and irreducible. My question is: Is it true that $$\exists\ \alpha\in \mathbb{Z}\ : \ f^{\ast}(Q)\sim \widetilde{Q}+\alpha\ E$$
