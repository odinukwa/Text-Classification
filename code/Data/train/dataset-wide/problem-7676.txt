Edit 3: Here is a plot of the bound given by Peter Mueller's post, together with the actual values for n=7. 

You should let us see the code that you used that produced the incorrect answers, so we can tell whether it is a Sage bug, a sage.matroids bug, or user-error! Finally, Stefan van Zwam has written a Mathematica program using Groebner bases to determine whether a matroid is representable, but the problem is hard unless you only want to know about matroids with less than 10 elements. I am not sure if he intends to add it to the Sage code-base or whether he even has it still. Ask him: 

Although it is not drawn planar, it is planar, and so it has no $K_5$-minor. However it has lots of $K_4$-minors. For example, the $0,4,6,8$ induces $K_4\backslash e$ and so adding any path from $4$ to $6$, say $4-7-1-6$ gives a graph that can be contracted to $K_4$. So this shows that deleting $2$ or $3$ or $5$ still leaves a $K_4$-minor. The remaining cases are similar and left as an exercise! As for the colouring, it is easy to see that it is not $3$-colourable just by working with the triangles (start with $0$ red, $6$ green and $8$ blue and follow your nose). But contracting any edge leaves a $3$-chromatic graph. You can see this easily enough by hand, or just run this code: 

When working with large numbers of graphs, a canonical labelling routine is essential as, after the initial cost of canonically labelling each graph, it permits isomorphism checks to be replaced with identity checks. Currently I am working with large numbers of transitive permutation groups; the degree is small (40ish) but the size of group can be large, and my programs are gumming up due to having to perform large numbers of - not exactly isomorphism - but conjugacy checks. (I need to check each pair of groups to see if they are conjugate in the symmetric group.) This process would be considerably easier if there was a known way of finding a canonical conjugate of the incoming permutation groups... 

Let $n,N,T$ be positive integers, with $N=\binom{n}{2}$, and $3\leq n\leq T\leq N$. Define: $$P(z):=z^{N+1-T}\int_0^1\frac{(1-t^2)^{n-2}}{(1-(1-z)t)^{N+1}}{}_2F_1\left[-T,N+1,N+2-T; \frac{tz}{1-(1-z)t}\right]dt.$$ I am interested in evaluating the limit $\lim_{z\rightarrow 0}P(z)$. I am wondering if there is any nice expression for this limit, perhaps as another hypergeometric function. I would be thrilled if the limit is another integral. In fact, I know that $P(z)$ itself is a polynomial, so there's a lot of magic happening to make this work. The difficulty is resolving the singularity at $z=0,t=1$. It seems like all of the terms in the hypergeometric function contribute to this integral. Notice that one cannot just write the hypergeometric function as a sum and then swap the swap the sum with the integral and the limit. I've tried a number of Kummer transformations to somehow make things nicer but I haven't see much progress. I've consulted a number of integral tables but haven't seen such an integral come up. One thing I've noticed is that since $-T$ is a negative integer, the hypergeometric function is a finite polynomial. In fact, it is proportional to the Jacobi polynomial $P_T^{(N+1-T,-1)}\left[\frac{1-t(1+z)}{1-t(1-z)}\right]$. I mention this because the $(1-t^2)^{n-2}$ term reminds me of the orthogonality weight for certain Jacobi polynomials, so perhaps some nice inner product is being computed here? Moreover, the full ratio $(1-t^2)^{n-2}/(1-(1-z)t)^{N+1}$ looks like the primary term involved in the Schlafli integral representation for Associated Legendre polynomials, although there the integral is on $[-1,1]$ or on a contour surrounding $1/(1-z)$. I was thinking of splitting the integral into two pieces: $\int_0^1=\int_0^c+\int_c^1$, with hopes that if $c$ is chosen carefully (as a function of $z$), only the latter integral contributes. It baffles me though, how to obtain some kind of uniform bound on the hypergeometric part with $z\approx 0$ and $t\approx 1$. Is there perhaps some modification of steepest descent or saddle point methods that would apply here? 

This answer just suggests a couple of directions that you can continue searching, rather than being definitive. Brouwer, Cohen and Neumaier use the term edge regular for the property that every pair of adjacent vertices have the same number of common neighbours (in other words, like strongly regular but dropping the condition on non-adjacent vertices). So your property is then edge regular with $\lambda = 1$. Of course any graph that is actually strongly regular with $\lambda = 1$ will do the trick, hence the Brouwer-Haemers graph and the Paley graph on 9 vertices that you already found. There are other SRGs with $\lambda=1$. There are various papers on edge-regular graphs of different types, but I don't know offhand if $\lambda=1$ has been tackled. On another tack, a graph is called locally $X$ if every neighbourhood is isomorphic to $X$, and so you are looking for graphs that are locally $rK_2$. Again there is lots of work on graphs that are locally this, locally that and locally the other, but I don't know offhand for $X =rK_2$. A third direction in which you may search is to observe that your condition is equivalent to every edge being in a unique triangle (+ regularity). This sounds like a condition that somebody should have studied, but at the risk of sounding like a broken record, I don't know offhand of any such results. However I think that there is definitely scope there for some interesting work. 

I think a 5-cycle meets your needs. Clique number 2, chromatic number 3. Check. (It does have a homomorphism to itself, but I assume you meant proper minor.) It has no homomorphism to a 4-cycle or a 4-path (the two possible minors with 4 edges) and so that leaves a hom to a triangle. Check. 

A bit long for a comment. I like this question because as far as I know there are a lot of open problems concerned with expressing the links you mentioned via combinatorics. Perhaps you'd be interested in the following: "On some combinatorial and algebraic properties of Dunkl elements" - Anatol Kirillov. The basic idea in that paper is that certain specializations and multiparameter deformations of Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials can be expressed through Narayana numbers, Catalan-Hankel determinants, and Schroder numbers, including some generalizations as well. In addition, these specializations come up in other areas such as $k$-triangulations of convex polygons and Carlitz-Riordan numbers. Through the wonderous abstract nonsense of Flags and degenerate loci, you can perhaps glean some knowledge. 

One example that I've seen is the real Ginibre ensemble which takes a random Gaussian matrix and focuses only on real eigenvalues. Then the probability of there being an even number of eigenvalues in $[0,s]$ matches the Wigner surmise. This is equivalent to certain statistics of creation/annihilation processes on the line. In addition to this, there are some statistical physics spin systems which seem to give an exact surmise as well. Unfortunately I'm not an expert in the latter area. Some more background: It's a well known fact that many random matrix ensembles exhibit a (limiting) density function of the form: $$p_0(s)=\frac{2u(\pi^2 s^2/4)}{s}\exp\left(-\int_0^{\pi^2 s^2/4}\frac{u(t)}{t}dt\right),$$ where $u$ satisfies a Painleve equation and of which $\rho_0^W(s)$ is a special case. So in short, $\rho^W_0(s)$ is usually an approximation, not an exact answer. One can certainly derive some conditions on $u$ and the resulting Painleve equation to get an exact Wigner surmise but this doesn't answer from which random matrix ensembles it comes from. 

I was wondering how many concurrent research projects a typical math researcher works on at a given time. I ask because I currently have the oppertunity to start a second project on something I'm fairly familiar with (background reading-wise). One of the main reasons I'm considering taking in a second project is because the first one is going rather slowly (I've hit a roadblock which is potentially insurmountable). If you do work on multiple projects, do you tend to jump between them the moment you get stuck or do you dedicate your full attention to one of them, for say, a week? What's your secret to staying productive? Just to be specific, let's limit "projects" to writing (contributing to) papers you intend to publish in the near future. As well, "working on" should be interpreted as dedicating a sizable chunk of your time to researching the problem at hand. I do not wish to count projects that you put aside for more than a few weeks until you have an inspiration. I understand the question is somewhat subjective and the obvious answer is that it depends on the person in question. The way I see it is when you work on multiple problems, part of the reason is that you are hedging your bets on which problem will end up solved. However, I'm just interested in the overall average (which im guessing has little variance) and more importantly whether it's bigger than 1. 

You are describing what are usually called "weak maps" between matroids. So a bijection $\varphi: E(\mathcal{N}) \to E(\mathcal{M})$ is called a weak map if for every independent set $I$ of $\mathcal{M}$ the inverse image $\varphi^{-1}(I)$ is independent in $\mathcal{N}$. In your case, you are asking when the identity function is a weak map, which just requires every independent set of $\mathcal{M}$ to be independent in $\mathcal{N}$. There is lots of stuff known about weak maps (and strong maps) and other things. Given a bunch of matroids on the same ground set, the weak-map relation is a partial order. The best place to start is around page 280 of the second edition of Oxley's book Matroid Theory, which refers to the original papers. The "minimal" relaxation that can be done is to take a single non-basis $N$ of $\mathcal{M}$ and form a matroid whose bases are ${\mathrm{bases}} (\mathcal{M}) \cup \{N\}$. This will work if (and, I think, only if) $N$ is a circuit-hyperplane of $\mathcal{M}$. So you certainly do not expect all of your relaxations to pass Sage's routine. In fact, I wanted to do a test to convince myself that it was working ok, so I ran the following code, just testing all the relaxations of a single randomly chosen matroid (in this case the matroid called ). All this does is create an array of matroids, each of which are specified by their bases, for which I am using the bases of together with one of the non-bases. Then I ask which of those matroids are valid. 

I know quite a lot about CI groups of small orders, but even then I don't know about every group of order up to 100, though I am gradually working through them. For order 30, it is fairly easy to ask GAP or Magma what the answer is, and the answer is that all four groups of order 30 are CI-groups. For each larger group, we can first test it as follows:
