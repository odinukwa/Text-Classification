Let $x_1,\dots,x_n$ be a set of points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $\mathcal{O}_1 ,\dots, \mathcal{O}_m$ denote a set of polyhedral obstacles. What is the name for the surfaces that describe the boundaries of a Voronoi tessellation of $\mathbb{R}^3$ with respect to the points $x_i$, using the shortest-path metric induced by the obstacles? By comparison, in $\mathbb{R}^2$, it is easy to show that the boundaries of a Voronoi tesselation are hyperbolic arcs. 

I have come across the following result regarding equitable division of a resource, which is a simple and immediate consequence of linear programming complementarity (in the infinite-dimensional case). I strongly suspect that it is a special case of some other well-known principle, perhaps in a related field such as economics or even geography, but as of yet I have not found any helpful leads. Can anyone suggest any results from which the statement below is a consequence? Any other leads will also be appreciated. Let $R$ denote a contiguous resource (such as a piece of land) that is to be divided into $n$ pieces $R_1,\dots,R_n$ among $n$ agents (so agent $i$ gets piece $R_i$). Suppose that each agent has a continuous "utility density" function $u_i(x)>0$ defined on $R$ and that $R$ also has a continuous "population density" $f(x)>0$ defined on it. The total "utility" that agent $i$ receives is then $\iint_{R_i} f(x)u_i(x) dx$. One might consider the problem of choosing $R_1,\dots,R_n$ as "equitably" as possible, say by maximizing the minimum utility of the agents: $\text{maximize}_{R_1,\dots,R_n}\lbrace\min_i \iint_{R_i} f(x)u_i(x) dx\rbrace$ subject to $\bigcup_i R_i = R$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j$ It is easy to verify that, at the optimal solution $R_1^*,\dots,R_n^*$, all of the agents' utilities are equal. Now, define $q_i^* := \iint_{R_i^*} f(x) dx$ (the population of the $i$th optimal piece), and consider the problem of choosing regions to maximize the total utilities of the agents, but under a logarithmic utility function, and imposing constraints on the populations in each piece: $\text{maximize}_{R_1,\dots,R_n}\lbrace\sum_i \iint_{R_i} f(x)\log(u_i(x)) dx\rbrace$ subject to $\iint_{R_i} f(x) dx = q_i^*$ $\bigcup_i R_i = R$ and $R_i \cap R_j = \emptyset \text{ for all }i\neq j$ It is not hard to show that the solution to this problem is the same as the solution to the original problem. I have uploaded a MATLAB script that demonstrates this principle using cvx at $URL$ if anyone is interested. 

Is there some suitable generalization to the notion of Baire property for topological spaces of arbitrary cardinalities which satisfies the following condition: 

I consider an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero $F$ as a vector space over a real closed field $R \subset F$. I would like to define a norm on $F$ in an invariant fashion, i.e. if we consider another real closed subfield $R' \subset F$ then the norm would still be equivalent to the norm defined taking $R$. More precisely, for instance for $\mathbb{C}$ we have the norm $N(z)=a^2 +b^2$ where $z=a+ib$, $a,b \in \mathbb{R}$. If we consider $R' \subset \mathbb{C}$ then the same $z \in \mathbb{C}$ will be written as $z=a'+jb'$, $a', b' \in R'$ and $R'$ is a real closed field of index 2 in $\mathbb{C}$. Is the norm $N'(z)=a'^2+b'^2$ equivalent to $N$? 

Let $M,N$ be transitive models of set theory and $M \subset N$. Assume that in $M$ we prove that there exists an object $X$ that satisfies some set $T$ of first order properties and which is definable from ordinals. (here $T$ means a set of first order formulas with one free variable X in the language of set theory). Does the same conclusion hold in $N$, i.e. does there exist an $Y$ in $N$ satisfying the same properties $T$? Edit: by a proof in M I mean just a fact that is proven about M. 

Suppose I'd like to distribute a set of points $P=\lbrace p_1 ,\dots, p_n \rbrace$ in the unit square $S=[0,1]\times[0,1]$ to minimize a weighted sum of two things: 1) The average distance between a uniformly selected point in $S$ and its nearest neighbor in $P$, i.e. $D_{avg}(P) = \iint_S \min_i\lbrace\|x-p_i\|\rbrace dA $ , and 2) The sum of the edge lengths in a Delaunay triangulation of $P$, notated $DT(P)$, so that my problem can be written as $\mathrm{minimize}_P ~ D_{avg}(P) +\phi DT(P)$ for some scalar $\phi$. Let's suppose that we can also choose the number of points in $P$ as well. My question is: as $\phi\rightarrow0$, is the optimal solution $P^*$ going to be a honeycomb lattice? The honeycomb conjecture, $URL$ , would appear to suggest that the answer to my question would be "yes" if, instead of using a Delaunay triangulation, we took the sum of the edges of a Voronoi diagram of $P$, but even that will probably require quite a bit of work. 

I read somewhere about the hyperuniverse of countable transitive models of ZFC ($URL$ It states an assumption, namely that every real is a member of some countable transitive model of ZFC. Is there some way to prove this assumption (assuming the hyperuniverse is not empty), or rather the (seemingly stronger) one: Every finite set of reals is a member of a ctm? 

The question is exactly stated by the title, i.e. how complicated is the formula $\psi(x)$ (in the language of set theory) expressing that a given set of reals $x$ is non-measurable? A second question would be: can this formula be deduced from a formula (possibly with ordinal parameters or a countable sequence of ordinals) which involves only quantification over reals and natural numbers? PS: By "deduced" I mean, given a formula $\varphi(x)$ defining a set $x$, then can we have $ZFC \vdash \forall x (\varphi(x) \rightarrow \psi(x))$. 

Let $M,N$ be models of set theory such that $M$ is a submodel of $N$. Assume that there exists a formula of set theory which defines some set $X^M$ in $M$ (say $X^M$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}$ which satisfies certain first-order properties). If we consider $N$, then does the same formula still define $X^N$ in $N$ and $X^N$ has the same properties in $N$ as $X^M$ in $M$? 

The only part I can answer definitively is #3, to which the answer is "no". If you place points in a square grid, the TSP tour is shorter than if you place points in a hexagonal lattice, but both satisfy the uniformness condition. As for #1, I think that the hexagonal lattice is conjectured to be the actual worst-case asymptotic distribution, but am unaware of any proof. You are probably aware of the following other references, which may be helpful: L. A. Goddyn. Quantizers and the worst-case euclidean traveling salesman problem. Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, 50(1):65–81, 1990. H. J. Karloff. How long can a euclidean traveling salesman tour be? SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2(1):91–99, 1989. K. J. Supowit, E. M. Reingold, and D. A. Plaisted. The travelling salesman problem and minimum matching in the unit square. SIAM Journal on Computing, 12(1):144–156, 1983. 

I believe the full details, along the lines of what domotorp posted, are provided in "Reconstructing sets of orthogonal line segments in the plane" by Rendl and Woeginger. From the abstract, "We show that reconstructing a set of $n$ orthogonal line segments in the plane from the set of their vertices can be done in $O(n log n)$ time, if the segments are allowed to cross. If the segments are not allowed to cross, the problem becomes NP-complete." The authors give a reduction to planar 3-SAT that uses points on an integer lattice, which I believe is the setting you're interested in. 

Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a model of set theory, and consider HOD (the hereditarily ordinal definable elements) of $\mathfrak{M}$. Let $K$ be any algebraically closed field in HOD of zero characteristic and any cardinality. Is there always a real closed subfield $R$ of $K$ of index 2 such that $R \in $ HOD? Under what condition $R$ is archimedean? Or rather, can we always find an archimedean real closed subfield $R$ of $K$ such that $R \in$ HOD? 

In a question and an answer at MO, Joel David Hamkins showed that (if ZFC is consistent) there are models of ZFC in which $V\neq HOD$ and every $\Sigma_2$-definable set has a definable member. Let $\mathfrak{M}$ be such a model. My question is: Can such a model $\mathfrak{M}$ satisfy further the following: (*) Every ordinal definable set of reals is Baire (or Lebesgue) measurable? I suspect very much that the answer is negative, but I would like the confirmation of an expert. 

Linear programs with this many variables are solved all the time using column generation: $URL$ In your problem, let variable $q_k$ denote the probability of using permutation $\pi_k$, and let variable $p_{ij}$ denote the marginal probability that agent $i$ is assigned to $j$, so you have a total of $n! + n^2$ variables. Let $\pi_k(i,j) = 1$ if agent $i$ is assigned to position $j$ in permutation $k$ and zero otherwise. We can relate the $p_{ij}$'s and $q_k$'s via $n^2$ constraints of the form $\sum_k q_k \pi_k(i,j) = p_{ij} \forall i,j$ Now, assume as Kevin did that $\sum_i v_i = \sum_j b_j = 1$. Your equity criterion is just $\sum_j p_{ij} v_j = b_i \forall i$. We obviously must require that $q_k \geq 0$ for all $k$. Thus the feasible set of these permutations can be written as: $\sum_k q_k = 1$ $p_{ij} = \sum_k q_k \pi_k (i,j) \forall i,j$ $q_k \geq 0 \forall k$ $\sum_j p_{ij} v_j = b_i \forall i$ There are a total of $1 + n^2 + n$ equality constraints and $n!$ inequality constraints, and you have $n! + n^2$ variables. Any basic feasible solution of this set (i.e. a corner point) therefore must have $n! - (n+1)$ of the inequality constraints active, which means that the corner points have only $n+1$ nonzero $q_k$'s. Thus, if your problem is feasible at all for particular choices of $v$ and $b$, it's possible to find such a set of assignments using at most $n+1$ possible permutations. You may gain further insight by looking at the dual of this LP -- the primal problem above has $n^2 + n!$ variables, $1 + n^2 + n$ equality constraints, and $n!$ inequality constraints, so its dual will have $n^2 + n!$ constraints, but only $1 + n^2 + n$ variables. Those constraints should have a nice structure to them (something like, one constraint for each permutation, and that constraint sums over all nonzero $\pi_k(i,j)$'s or something), which would give you a polynomial-time separation oracle for solving the dual LP. There may likely be a way to recover a primal solution from the dual using complementary slackness. 

Let $M$ be a saturated model of a theory $T$ in a first-order language $\mathcal{L}$, and let $N$ be a submodel of $M$. Is it possible to have a substructure $A\neq N$ of $M$ such that $N \subset A \subset M$ and every element of $A$ is definable by a formula in $L$ with parameters from $N$? 

Given two real closed fields $R_1$ and $R_2$ such that both have cardinality continuum, archimedean, but not necessarily complete. Assume further that they are back and forth equivalent (in the language of rings). Under which conditions can we get that they are isomorphic? Isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$? 

Let $T$ be a countable first-order theory, and assume that $T$ has exactly one atomic model up to isomorphism in every uncountable cardinality. (By "atomic" I mean a model which omits the non-principal types). Now let $\mathfrak{M}$ be a countable transitive model of set theory, and assume that $T$ is also (countable) in $\mathfrak{M}$. Is the above property preserved in $\mathfrak{M}$? i.e. does it hold in $\mathfrak{M}$ that there exists only one atomic model of $T$ in every uncountable cardinality in $\mathfrak{M}$?
