Motivation: Let $ X = {\rm Spec} A$. Assume that $D(f) \subseteq D(g)$. It is messy to think about the restriction map $ A_g \to A_f $ using formulas. Things are much more transparent in the language of representable functors. Indeed, $A_g$ represents the functor $$ R \mapsto \{ \text{maps $ A \to R$ which send $ g $ to a unit} \} $$ Since $ D(f) \subseteq D(g) $ we have a natural transformaion $$ \{ \text{maps $ A \to R$ which send $ f $ to a unit} \} \subseteq \{ \text{maps $ A \to R$ which send $ g $ to a unit} \} $$ The yoneda lemma gives us a ring homomorphism $ A_g \to A_f $ which is the restriction map in the structure sheaf of the affine scheme. I just want to emphasize that I am not saying the yoneda lemma construction is better, it is just easier for me to keep in my head than a bunch of formulas. Now let $S$ be a graded ring. We construct $ {\rm Proj} S $ by gluing together the affine schemes $ {\rm Spec} S_{(f)}$ where $ f \in S_{+}$ is homogeneous. In order to glue we need ring isomorphisms $$ S_{(fg)} \cong (S_{f})_{\frac{g^{\deg f}}{f^{\deg g}}} $$ If $ S_{(f)}$ represented a nice functor, we could try and mimic the construction of the restriction maps in the structure sheaf of an affine scheme. As it stands, the standard construction of this isomorphism is messy and very hard to remember (for me). 

Sorry for reviving this question. Everything Tom said is correct, but there is more to say about "coordinate-free Taylor series". It is true that arbitrary jet bundles $J^k(M,N)$ are subtle. The fibers are vector spaces but the transition maps are not linear. The special case $J^k(M,\mathbb{R})$ is a vector bundle and this is where the Taylor series of a map $f : M \to \mathbb{R}$ lives. The vector bundle $J^k(M,\mathbb{R})$ is not a tensor power of the tangent bundle as Tom pointed out, but it is far easier to understand than an arbitrary jet bundle. Indeed, the structure group of $J^k(M,\mathbb{R})$ is sometimes called the Phylon group. 

Zhen Lin's answer is great. Here is somthing I realized this morning (I belive this was one of the origonal motivations for the univalence axiom?). You can make sense of the statement "$ \Sigma_{A : \mathcal{U}} A \to \mathcal{U} $ is a universal fibration" inside HoTT. Lets call a type family $ P : B \to \mathcal{U}$ "fibration data". The corresponding fibration is $ \Sigma_{b : B} P(b) \to B $. In the paper homotopy limits in type theory, homotopy pullbacks are constructed inside HoTT. Indeed, $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} \Sigma_{a:A} \Sigma_{x:\Sigma_{b:B}P(b)} \pi x = f(a) @>>> \Sigma_{b:B} P(B)\\ @VVV @VVV \\ A @>{f}>> B \end{CD}$$ it a homotopy pullback square. Note, that using the induction principal for $\Sigma$-types it is easy to constructed the homotopy that makes this square homotopy commute. We have another homotopy commutative square $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} \Sigma_{a:A} P(f(a))@>>> \Sigma_{b:B} P(B)\\ @VVV @VVV \\ A @>{f}>> B \end{CD}$$ where the top map and the homotopy are constructed using $\Sigma$-induction. The universal property of homotopy pullbacks gives us a map $$ \Sigma_{a : A} P(f(a)) \to \Sigma_{a : A} \Sigma_{x : \Sigma_{b : B}P(b)} \pi x = f(a) $$ and homotopies making the obvious diagram commute upto homotopy. Infact, it is easy to construct the map and homotopies directly using $ \Sigma$-induction. Again, using $\Sigma$-induction and the introduction rule for equality types in a $ \Sigma$-type we can construct a quasi-inverse to this map, so it is an equivalence. Moreover, this quasi-inverse fits into the appropriate homotopy commutative diagram, which tells us that the second commutative square above is infact a homotopy pullback square. I worked all of this out explicitly this morning. It is a good exercise in working inside HoTT, so i wont spoil it for anyone else who is interested. What all of this tells us is that given fibration data $P : A \to \mathcal{U}$, the corresponding fibration is the homotopy pullback of $ \Sigma_{ A : \mathcal{U}} A \to \mathcal{U}$ along $ P $. 

Lets work over $\mathbb{C}$. Let $G$ be a reductive group with semisimple rank 1 (this means that a maximal torus in $G / R(G)$ has dimension 1). In section 25 of Humphreys book "linear algebraic groups", it is claimed that $G / Z(G)$ is isomorphic to ${\rm PGL}_2$, but I don't understand the proof. Let me be a little more precise. Write $I$ for the intersection of all borel subgroups of $G$. I understand why $ G / I \cong {\rm PGL}_2$ and why $I / Z(G)$ is finite. I just don't understand how Humphreys concludes that $I = Z(G)$. 

In what follows assume that the base field is $\mathbb{C}$ Background: Let $C$ be an irreducible plane algebraic curve, $S$ the set of singular points. There exists a Riemann surface $\tilde{C}$ and a holomorphic mapping $\sigma : \tilde{C} \to C$ such that $\sigma^{-1}(S)$ is finite and $\sigma : \tilde{C} \backslash \sigma^{-1}(S) \to C \backslash S$ is a biholomorphism. We say $(\tilde{C}, \sigma)$ is the normalisation of $C$. Question: I know the normalisations of some smooth plane algebraic curves (e.g the normalisation of a non singular elliptic curve is a torus) Can anyone give me some examples of the normalisations of singular plane algebraic curves? What I am ideally looking for is an example of a singular plane algebraic curve and the corresponding Riemann surface and map. 

In quantum mechanics, state is encoded as a unit vector in a Hilbert space. If we just studied $\mathbb{C}^N$ and $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, life would be boring and we would be missing out on a lot of interesting physics and mathematics. Here is a more general setup. Let $M$ be a manifold. Choose a principal $G$-bundle $P \to M$ and a finite dimensional $G$-representation $V$. Then $E = P \times_G V$ is a $G$-vector bundle on $M$. If $G \subseteq U(n)$ for some $n$, then we have a Hermitian product on $E$, so we can talk about $L^2(E)$. This is a Hilbert space. Sections of $E$ are called "matter fields" or quantum particles. You get different species of particles from different representations $V$. For example, protons an neutrons correspond to taking $G = SU(2)$ and $V = \mathbb{C}^2$ the first fundamental representation. In quantum mechanics, we need to talk about observables. We can multiply sections of $E$ by sections of the trivial bundle $M \times \mathbb{R}$. This generalizes position. Momentum is more interesting. If we want to differentiate sections of $E$, we need to choose a connection on $P$. In physics, this is called a gauge field and generalizes the electromagnetic potential (the curvature is called the field strength). Things get more interesting once you realize that connections on $P$ are the same as sections of the adjoint bundle $P \times_G \mathfrak{g}$. In other words, you can work with gauge fields just like you work with the other particles. Things get more subtle if you want to work relativistically or do quantum field theory. EDIT: Let me talk about the relationship between sections and particles a bit more. In statistics and probability theory, we assign probabilities to logical statements. For example, if $X$ is a random variable taking values in the finite set $S = \{ a,b,c \}$, then we assign a probability to the statement $X = a$. In quantum theory, we assign amplitudes (complex numbers) to logical statements. We can talk about a quantum particle in $S$. It is specified by a function $\psi : S \to \mathbb{C}$ and $\psi(a)$ is the amplitude that the particle is in state $a$. If we have a quantum particle in the real line, then its position is going to be specified by a function $\psi : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}$. Now suppose that we have a quantum particle in the real line which can be in one of two states $a$ or $b$. In this case, the state is specified by a function $\psi : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}\{ a,b \}$. More generally, if we are talking about quantum particles with internal state on a manifold, we could specify them as functions $M \to V$ but it is useful to also discuss sections of more general vector bundles. I learned all this from reading QED and thinking about the analogies between statistics and quantum mechanics. If I had to explain this in one sentence, I would say something like "Quantum particles behave more like random variables than points in space, but you use amplitudes instead of probabilities"
