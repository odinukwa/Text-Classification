Let start with notations: $Y$ is a spectra, $H\mathbb{Z}$ is the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectra associated to $\mathbb{Z}$ The singular homology of $Y$ is given by $H_{i}(Y)=\pi_{i}^{stable}(Y\wedge H\mathbb{Z} )$ and the cohomology $H^{i}(Y)= \pi_{-i}^{stable}F(Y,H\mathbb{Z})$, where $F(-,-)$ is (derived) internal Hom in the category of spectra. This grading is justified ones you take for $Y=\Sigma^{\infty}X_{+}$ for some space $X$ then every thing take place. Usually, the cohomology of spaces is indexed with positive integers so for example for a space $X$, we write $H^{4}(X, \mathbb{Z})= \pi_{-4}^{stable}F(\Sigma^{\infty}X_{+},H\mathbb{Z})$ 

I wanted to ask a summary of known results and references about the homotopy type of the mapping space $\mathrm{Map}(BG,BK)$ (and specially the connected components) between the classifying spaces when G and K are general topological groups. Thank you. 

I think you will have different answers to your questions. As you noticed there is more about Hochschild Homology in n-lab page and you also pointed out the interpretation of (positive) low dimension of Hochschild cohomology. I would say that the Hochschild cohomology is "The" cohomology theory for differential graded algebras in the following sense. Let $\mathsf{dgAlg}_{k}^{\geq 0}= \mathsf{A}$ be the category of (connective) differential graded algebras over a commutative ring $k$, which is a model category . Fix a morphism of DG $k$-algebras $f:R\rightarrow S $ with $R$ cofibrant DGA, then the homotopy groups of the mapping space $Map_{\mathsf{A}}(R,S)_{f}$ are closely related to the (negative) Hochschild cohomology $HH^{-\ast}(R,S)$ where you see $S$ as an $R$-bimodule via $f$. More precisely, for all $i>1$: $$\pi_{i}Map_{\mathsf{A}}(R,S)_{f}\cong HH^{1-i}(R,S). $$ In the particular case $id:R\rightarrow R$, we can say more i.e., $\pi_{1}Map_{\mathsf{A}}(R,R)_{id} $ is a subgroup of the units group of the algebra $HH^{0}(R,R)$ (i.e., $HH^{0}(R,R)^{\times}$). Block and Lazarev gave an interpretation of the (negative) Andre-Quillen cohomology in the case of commutative differential graded $\mathbf{Q}$-algebras denoted by $\mathsf{C}$. $$ \pi_{i}Map_{\mathsf{C}}(R,S)_{f}\cong AQ^{-i}(R,S), i>1. $$ 

Question What can we say about the map $B\rightarrow A$? Does it induce an isomorphism in homology? Edit: The spaces $C,B$ are connected. 

Is there an exmaple of a closed smooth connected manifold $M$ having a structure of $A_{\infty}$-space (with unit) but $M$ is not homeomorphic to a compact connectd Lie group as space ? Edit: First, I would like to thank Fernando, Vladimir and Jesper for the excellent answers! My original motivation was the following question: Suppose that $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ is a cofibrant replacement of the associative operad $\mathcal{A}$ in the category $\mathsf{Op}$ of topological operads (non-symmetric) and suppose that $X$ is a finite connected $CW$-complex. Is it true that $$Hom_{\mathsf{Op}}(\mathcal{A}_{\infty},End(X))\neq \emptyset \Rightarrow Hom_{\mathsf{Op}}(\mathcal{A},End(X))\neq \emptyset ?$$ Here is a counterexample: Suppose that $M$ is a smooth closed connected manifold with a structure of $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$-space (i.e, Loop space) such that $M$ is not homotopy equivalent to a Lie group. By definition $Hom_{\mathsf{Op}}(\mathcal{A}_{\infty},End(M))\neq \emptyset$. On another hand if $Hom_{\mathsf{Op}}(\mathcal{A},End(M))\neq \emptyset$, this will implie that $M$ has at least one structure of topological monoid. By Wallace Theorem any closed manifold with a structure of topological monoid is a Lie group, hence $M$ is a Lie group. Contradiction. 

Sketch of proof. I will use the following ingredients 0) the category of spaces will be the category of simplicial sets. All the computation are in the derived sense. 1) use the Quillen adjunction $$F: sSet^{\otimes}\longleftrightarrow sMod_{k}^{\otimes}: U$$ between the category of monoids in simplicial sets and monoids in simplicial $k$-modules . 2) the category of simplicial $k$-algebras is Quillen equivalent to the category of differential graded $k$-algebras (i.e. monoids in the category of chain complexes of $k$-modules in positive degree) $$N: sMod_{k}^{\otimes}\longleftrightarrow Ch^{\otimes}_{k}: S$$ Now suppose that $T$ is a homotopy push out $X\leftarrow Y\rightarrow Z$ of connected pointed simplicial sets (Kan complexes), then $\Omega T$ is the homotopy pushout of $\Omega X\leftarrow \Omega Y\rightarrow \Omega Z$ in the category in $sSet^{\otimes}$ (notice that the model that I'm using for loop space gives me a honest simplicial monoid). The functor $F$ commutes with homotopy push out, it means that that $F(\Omega T)$ is a homotopy push out of $F(\Omega X)\leftarrow F(\Omega Y)\rightarrow F(\Omega Z)$ in $sMod_{k}^{\otimes}$, therefor the $NF(\Omega X)\leftarrow NF(\Omega Y)\rightarrow NF(\Omega Z)$ is a homotopy push out in the category $Ch^{\otimes}_{k}$ and the functor $NF$ can be identified with $C_{\ast}(-,k)$. It means that $$C_{\ast}(\Omega T)\simeq C_{\ast}(\Omega X)\sqcup_{C_{\ast}(\Omega Y)}^{h}C_{\ast}(\Omega Z)$$ as differential graded algebras, where $\sqcup$ is the coproduct in the category of $DGA$. This statement is true for any pointed connected spaces $X, Y$ and $Z$. 

I was wondering if there is an easy counter example to what follows: Suppose that $E$ is contractible CW-complex and $G_{1}, G_{2}$ are two isomorphic groups acting freely and continuously on $E$. Is it true that the two actions are conjugated ? 

My question is the follwoing: It there a know triple $(K, G, H)$ verifiying the conditions 1 and 2 such that $G$ is not isomorphic to $H$ ? I'm more interested when $G$ is a perfect group, but any example (if there exists) is welcome. Edit: In the case where $K$ is finite, Culler theorem says that $K, G, H$ are all isomorphic. 

I think the right way to call this functors is "quasi-representable" functors (in the language of Toen) and "potentially distinguished" functors in the language of Dwyer-Hess. At least when $\mathbf{V}$ is one of these model categories 1) simplicial sets ($\mathbf{sSet}$), (compactly generated) topological space ($\mathbf{Top}$), symmetric spectra ($\mathbf{Sp}^{\Sigma}$) you can almost copy-paste Toen's argument to construct 1) the (derived) mapping space (using the moduli space of quasi representable functors) 2) the derived internal Hom of the model category $\mathbf{V}-Cat$. 

I did not understand exactly your question. What is important here, is the ring $k$. If $k=\mathbf{Z}$ then the problem you are asking for is hard, if $k$ is any commutative ring then the problem is very hard. If $k$ is a field of characteristic 0 or $\mathbf{F}_{p}$ then there is always a solution. When the characteristic is 0, the problem is solved by Sullivan (under finiteness condition + simply connected+ condition on generalized Steenrod 0-operation cf comments). I will try to explain the situation over $\mathbf{F}_{p}$. Detnote by $\mathsf{E}_{\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}}$ the model category of $E_{\infty}$- differential graded $\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}$-algebras (in positive degree). Mandell's theorem says the following Quillen adjunction : $$C^{\ast}(-,\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}):\mathsf{sSet}^{op} \longrightarrow \mathsf{E}_{\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}}: Map_{\mathsf{E}_{\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}}}(-,\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p})$$ which induces an equivalence between $\infty$-subcategories (I will not go to the details here). Suppose $S$ is graded commutative $\mathbf{F}_{p}$-algebra, such that in each degree $S_{n}$ is finite dimensional $\mathbf{F}_{p}$-module, and $S_{0}=\mathbf{F}_{p}$ and $S_{1}=0$. In particular $S\otimes\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p} $ is an object of $\mathsf{E}_{\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}}$. The space you are looking for is given by the derived $\mathbb{R}Map_{\mathsf{E}_{\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}}}(S\otimes\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p} ,\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p})\simeq \mathbb{R}Map_{\mathsf{E}_{\mathbf{F}_{p}}}(S ,\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}):=X$. Applying Mendell's Theorem, we obtain that $$C^{\ast}(X,\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p})\simeq S\otimes\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}. $$ By definition, the cohomology of $X$ with coefficients in $\overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}$ is $S\otimes \overline{\mathbf{F}}_{p}$ since $S$ is formal by definition. Then you conclude for $\mathbf{F}_{p}$ coefficients. PS: the functor $C^{\ast}(-,k)$ is the functor of cochain complex. 

in the rational case, the forgetful functor U: dgCAlg-------> dgAlg induces a faithful functor in homotopy category under the following conditions. R is connected (connective) differential commutative graded Q-algebra and S= C(X,Q) (the cochaine complex of a space with coefficients in Q, then Ho(dgCAlg) (R,S)-----> Ho(dgAlg)(UR,US) is injective. 

There is at least 3 model structures on the category of topological spaces, the Quillen Model structure, the Storm model structure and the Mixed model structure. In the Mixed model structure $\mathsf{MixTop}$ ( mixed model structure), weak equivalence are weak homotopy equivalences, fibrations are Hurewicz fibrations and cofibrations are determined by the lifting property. Suppose that we have a continuous map $f:X\rightarrow Y$ between cofibrant objects in $\mathsf{MixTop}$ and $f$ is a closed embedding i.e. $f(X)$ is closed subspace of $Y$ and $f:X\rightarrow f(X)$ is a homemorphism. I was wondering if $f$ is a cofibration in $\mathsf{MixTop}$? Here is the nLab reference for the mixed cofibrations. 

The induced map $D\rightarrow C$ is a trivial fibration The map $f:B\rightarrow A$ has weakly contractible fibers i.e., for any $a\in A$ we have $f^{-1}(a)\simeq \ast$ The induced map $D\rightarrow B$ induces an isomorphism in homology. The map $C\rightarrow A$ induces a surjective map in homology. We can assume that $A$ is simply connected. 

I will try to give a example in topology and then in dg-world. Suppose that $G$ and $H$ are topological groups. There is a fiber sequence $$Map_{\ast}(BG,BH)\rightarrow Map(BG,BH)\rightarrow BH$$ where $B$ is the classifying space. Here is a homotopy categorical interpretation of the previous fiber sequence. $$Map^{\otimes}(G,H)\rightarrow Map_{top-cat}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{H})\rightarrow Map_{Top-cat}(\ast, \mathbf{H})$$ where $Map^{\otimes} $ is the derived mapping space in the model category of topological mono ids. $Map_{Top-cat}$ is the derived mapping space in the model category of small topological categories. The notation $\mathbf{H}$ is for the topological category with one object such that the endomorphism monoid is $H$. So what happens in the dg-world. Well, there is a fiber sequence $$Map_{dg-algebras}(A,B)\rightarrow Map_{dg-cat}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})\rightarrow Map_{dg-cat}(\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{B})$$ The notation $\mathbf{A}$ is for the $dg_{k}$-category with one object such that the endomorphism monoid is $A$. $k$ is the ground commutative ring. Now we see why $Map_{dg-algebras}(A,B)$ is different from $Map_{dg-cat}(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B})$. 

May be I misunderstood your question. $C^{\ast}(X)$ is an $E_{\infty}$-algebra. For pointed simply connected space $X$ there is an equivalent of $E_{\infty}$-algebra between $BC^{\ast}(X)$ and $C^{\ast}(\Omega X)$ under some finiteness conditions on $X$. The functor $B$ can be seen as the suspension functor (in the derived sense) in the category of augmented $E_{\infty}$-algebra and the functor $C^{\ast}(-)$ (under some assumption on spaces ) takes finite homotopy limits of spaces to homotopy colimits of $E_{\infty}$-algebras (I'm working over a field). some reference: math.univ-lille1.fr/~fresse/Bar-StructureUniqueness.pdf It is better to see $C^{\ast}(X)$ as an $E_{\infty}$-algebra and not just as a differential graded algebra. As we see the interpretation can be made more comprehensive from homotopical view point. 

Suppose we have a pullback of topological spaces (CW-complexes) $B\rightarrow A\leftarrow C$ which I will denote by $D$. Assumptions 

I have some questions about Dennis trace map in algebraic K-Theory. I was wondering if there is some conceptual way to look at this map $K(-)\rightarrow THH(-)$ (natural transformation from K-Theory to Topological Hochschild Homology). As far as I understand, Tabuada constructed a stable model category $\mathcal{M}$ containing the category of small DG-categories (and small Spectral categories). Roughly speaking, $\mathcal{M}$ is a Bousfield localization of the category of spectral presheaves on the category of small spectral categories. The algebraic K-Theory is representable by the spectral category $\mathbb{S}-Mod^{c}$ spectra which are compact. The spectral enrichment $\mathbf{Sp}_{\mathcal{M}}$ represents the algebraic (Waldhausen) K-Theory as follows $\mathbf{Sp}_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbb{S}-Mod^{c},A)\simeq K(A-Mod^{c})$ where $A$ is a dg (or spectral category). With this notations $\mathbf{Sp}_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbb{S}-Mod^{c},THH(-))\simeq THH(\mathbb{S})$, the Dennis trace map is represented by the class $[1]: \pi_{0}\mathbf{Sp}_{\mathcal{M}}(\mathbb{S}-Mod^{c},THH(-))\simeq \mathbf{Z}.$ My question is the following: What happens if we restrict our self to commutative $(E_{\infty})-\mathbb{S}$-Algebras and noticing that in this case $THH(R)\simeq S^{1}\otimes R$ for any $E_{\infty}$-algebra $R$. Is it possible to construct the trace map $K(-)\rightarrow S^{1}\otimes-$ (of $E_{\infty}$-algebra?!) in purely categorical comprehensive way without using Tabuada's sophisticated machinery and Dennis-Bökstedt technical results ? PS: if there is some mathematical mistakes, please do correct me. Thank you. 

Then the natural map $k[G^{\delta}]\rightarrow C_{\ast}(G,k)$ of $E_{\infty}$-algebras induces a quasi-isomorphism $$ C_{\ast}(G,k)\otimes_{k[G^{\delta}]}^{\mathbf{L}} C_{\ast}(G,k)\rightarrow C_{\ast}(G,k)$$ of $E_{\infty}$-algebras. 

$G$ and $H$ are finite groups and $K$ an infinite group. there exists two monomorphisms $G\rightarrow K\leftarrow H$ inducing an isomorphism in homology (with integral coefficients)
