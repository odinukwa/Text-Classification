This is extremely common in institutional markets, and is called a "repo" transaction - short for Repurchase agreement In a repo transaction, you "sell" the bond to the bank and agree to buy it back again at a fixed price in the future (regardless what the actual market price may be). This is the same business model as pawnbroking. If you fail to buy the bond back, the bank gets to keep the bond. The reason it is done as this sale-and-repurchase, rather than collateral (which is economically identical) is that it makes handling a default much simpler. If you default on a collateralised loan, the lender still has to apply to take full ownership of the collateral, which can delay matters (such as under chapter 11 protection). In a repo transaction, the bank already legally owns the bond and has it in custody, so it is much simpler. It is worth noting, that although they have bought the bond from you the repo agreement (GMRA - "General Master Repo Agreement") specifies that the original owner retails "full economic interest" in the bond - that is they get any interest payments from the original bond. That said, this is most commonly done for Treasury bonds in highly rated countries (US, UK, Germany etc.). Since the bond is collateral for the loan banks are less keen to lend you for bonds that are risky, as should the collateral become worthless, then the loan becomes unsecured. For this reason repo transactions in EM bonds or Corporate Bonds tend to have a significant "haircut". The haircut is the difference between the value of the bond and the amount borrowed. So in your example, a repo transaction of a poor country bond the bank may take a 20% haircut, so to buy \$10m of the bond, you would borrow \$8m and pay for \$2m yourself. The logic here is the same as when you mortgage your house, the bank won't usually lend you the full value of the house. As you might have guessed from my example using millions, repo transactions are done between banks and institutional investors, not the man-on-the-street.

An exchange can handle more than one currency, but this would be uncommon for equities. An example is the ICE futures exchange in Europe. Multiple currencies doesn't cause any particular problems - transactions are carried out in currency and it is up to you to convert to whatever currency you prefer. Usually done by fx sweeps by your custodian bank. For margin purposes combined exposure (e.g risk netting) can be calculated at prevailing fx rates. Each security only trades in one currency, and each security trades basically like a mini exchange so there isn't really any problem. Think of it like two exchanges run by the same company. 

Just to synthesize the other two answers together a bit and "join-the-dots". Setting the Scene Since 2011 SNB had decided that it wanted to prevent the CHF from strengthening past 1.2 CHF per EUR. In order to do this it had to do either or both of: 

I don't know exactly how the numbers would work out, but you would expect an equilibrium but it will depend on many factors. A complication is that you have public companies taken private and private companies that never go public. It may be there is some equilibrium between these as they are unlikely to be equivalent. Ex public companies are often highly levered, while never public are often debt free and cash rich. Particular important factors would be interest rates and credit spreads. This is because it boils down to the distribution of capital. If there is lots of money available to lend then LBOs become attractive and companies can be taken private. If there is strong demand for equity then IPOs become easy. I think an economy with a shortage of public companies would show overvalued equities and hence IPOs are encouraged (think dot com bubble - shortage of public web companies vs demand). If debt is cheap and there are too many public companies then you will see either take overs or LBOs. I suspect the effect is most visible within sectors rather than the whole economy. 

A note on reaching the balanced consumption path: This concept usually exists when there is some conflict between balancedness and optimality or when the consumer is boundedly rational. (E.g. Solow model.) Here this does not seem to be the case. However when such conflicts arise there is usually a never-ending (Is this the correct spelling of this word? Please correct if wrong.) convergence towards the balanced path. The distance decreases in every period but never becomes 0. 

Minimalist guesses ("here are some profiles with $n = 4$") are fine, ideal solution would provide a proof that $n$ is minimal. 

Taking @Henry's comment because he is too lazy to type it in as answer: As long as $f$ is twice differentiable (which is likely if $MP(x)$ exists) just the fact that $f(x)$ is concave implies $\dfrac{d^2f(x)}{dx^2} < 0$. This is also the first differentiate of $MP(x)$, thus it is diminishing. So all you need is concavity. The 'rule' you refer to has different implications. 

I am not sure I understand your question but if I do, then I do not agree. Marginal cost is defined as the derivative of the cost function. If the producible units are too large then marginal cost is less likely be a good approximation of non-marginal cost changes. The importance of this is that the derivative of an estimated cost function will probably not correspond to the real cost increase when non-marginally increasing the output. 

I get the same equation as you do. So you are correct. But tough usually $u_t - u_{t-1} \neq -g_{y_{t}}$, for small values of $g_{y_{t}}$ $$ u_t - u_{t-1} \approx - g_{y_{t}} $$ does hold. In macroeconomics these kind of (in my opinion annoying) approximations are used every now and then. The author perhaps neglected to mention that he was using an approximation. For example the Fisher equation is sometimes written as $i = r + \pi$, even though it is actually $i \approx r + \pi$ and that only for small values of $r,\pi$. 

I am not sure I understand your question. $\lambda$ is a Lagrange multiplicator which has a value in the optimum. It is not a parameter and hence you cannot leave it in your solution. When solving the Lagrangian the optimal solution has the form $(x,\lambda)$ and in addition to your conditions $$x_1 = \frac{\alpha}{\lambda p_1} + b_1$$ $$x_2 = \frac{\beta}{\lambda p_2} + b_2$$ $$x_3 = \frac{\gamma}{\lambda p_3} + b_3$$ it also has to fulfill $$ (p \cdot x - w) \lambda = 0. $$ If $\lambda \neq 0$ this also means $p \cdot x = w$. $\lambda$ cannot be equal to zero because it is in the denominator of your optimal solution for $x$: $$x(p,w) = (b_1, b_2, b_3) + \left(\frac{\alpha}{\lambda p_1},\frac{\beta}{\lambda p_2},\frac{\gamma}{\lambda p_3}\right)$$ and hence you were correct to use the Walras law or budget constraint. For more on optimality conditions see the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker theorem. About $b_1, b_2$ and $b_3$: I think this is supposed to be a bliss point. 

After posting a bad solution yesterday I believe I got a better one: The strategy of the buyer consists of two functions, $(f_1(v,p_1),f_2(v,p_1,p_2))$ where both functions map to $\left\{A,R\right\}$ (where $A$ stands for Accept, $R$ for Reject). The strategy of the seller is $(p_1,p_2(f_1(v,p_1)))$. You get the solution via backward induction. In PBE $f_2(v,p_1,p_2)$ maps to $A$ if and only if $v \geq p_2$. (There is inconsequential leeway at equality.) In PBE the seller believes that there is a set $H$ of types for which the buyer refused her offer $p_1$. Then $$ p_2^* = \arg\max_{p_2} p_2 \cdot Prob(f_2(v,p_1,p_2) = A | f_1(v,p_1) = R). $$ The buyer will accept offer $p_1$ if and only if $$ v - p_1 \geq \delta \cdot (v - p_2). $$ From this you get $$ v \cdot (1 - \delta) \geq p_1 - \delta \cdot p_2. $$ The left hand side of this equation is increasing in $v$, so types with high valuation will Accept. This means that in PBE the set $H$ is such that $$ H = [0, \bar{v}). $$ From this we get the optimal $p_2$ given $\bar{v}$: $$ p_2^* = \arg\max_{p_2} p_2 \cdot Prob(v \geq p_2 | v \in [0, \bar{v})) = \frac{\bar{v}}{2}. $$ In PBE $\bar{v}$ is a function of $p_1$: $$ \bar{v} \cdot (1 - \delta) = p_1 - \delta \cdot \frac{\bar{v}}{2}, $$ so $$ \bar{v} = \frac{p_1}{1 - \frac{\delta}{2}}. $$ We have determined all the PBE strategies but $p_1$. The expected payoff of the seller is $$ p_1 \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{p_1 - \delta \cdot p_2(\bar{v}(p_1))}{1 - \delta} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot p_2(\bar{v}(p_1)) \cdot \left( \frac{p_1 - \delta \cdot p_2(\bar{v}(p_1))}{1 - \delta} - p_2(\bar{v}(p_1)) \right), $$ where $$ p_2(\bar{v}(p_1)) = \frac{\bar{v}(p_1)}{2} = \frac{\frac{p_1}{1 - \frac{\delta}{2}}}{2} = \frac{p_1}{2 - \delta}. $$ Substituting this we get $$ p_1 \cdot \left( 1 - \frac{p_1 - \delta \cdot \frac{p_1}{2 - \delta}}{1 - \delta} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{p_1}{2 - \delta} \cdot \left( \frac{p_1 - \delta \cdot \frac{p_1}{2 - \delta}}{1 - \delta} - \frac{p_1}{2 - \delta} \right), $$ You have to maximize this w.r.t. $p_1$. With $\delta = 0.5$ I got $$ p_1^* = \frac{9}{20}, \hskip 20pt \bar{v} = \frac{3}{5}, \hskip 20pt p_2^* = \frac{3}{10}. $$
