Tony Scholl has a paper in which he expands on Deligne's construction in such a way as to explain how to construct Grothendieck motives attached to cuspidal eigenforms. The main focus of Scholl's paper (if I remember correctly) is how to take into account the need for compactification in a precise motivic fashion; still, he gives a useful reprise of Deligne. In any event, depending on your particular difficulties with Deligne, you may find Scholl's presentation helpful. 

My own belief is that contemporary discounting of the validity of Euler's arguments is misplaced. Euler wrote arguments to the standards of his day. If he were writing now, he would write arguments to the standards of our day. As far as I know, and given his brilliance and insight, there's no reason to think that he wouldn't have been able to fill in any analytic details required to justify his arguments (which in the case under discussion are fairly straightforward). 

$H^1({\mathbb G}_m)$ is the same motive as $H^2(\mathbb P^1)$, so I believe that inverting $\mathbb G_m$ is the same as inverting the Lefschetz motive. (Topologically, fundamental classes all ultimately arise from the $H^1$ of the circle, so we must invert this if fundamental classes are to be invertible.) In the pure context, one is not allowed to talk about ${\mathbb G}_m$, and so talks of $H^2(\mathbb P^1)$ instead; but I do think it is the same process. Note that this is compatible with Dustin Clausen's and Marty's answers: in all realizations (Galois representations, computing periods, ... ) of motives, we can and do invert the Lefschetz motive (since it just becomes the inverse cyclotomic character, or $2 \pi i$, or ... ). Incidentally, related to David Roberts's answer, smashing with $\mathbb G_m$ is what number theorists call a Tate twist, I believe, and on the level of Galois representations it it is just tensoring with the cyclotomic character (here I am thinking of $H_1(\mathbb G_m)$). So asking for $\mathbb G_m$ to be invertible is the same as asking that one can perform Tate twists (of arbitrary integer power) on the level of motives. Now if $M$ is a motive over a number field, with $L$-function $L(M,s)$, and $M(n)$ is its $n$th Tate twist, then the $L$-function of $M(n)$ is simply $L(M,s + n)$. So the Tate twisting parameter is the same as the parameter $s$ in the $L$-function (restricted to integer values, of course). Thus the desire to have this parameter really be an integer (and not just a natural number) also has deep roots in the conjectured relations between special values of $L$-functions and the arithmetic geometry of motives. (If one looks at the simplest $L$-function, namely the Riemann zeta function, it has special values at positive and negative integers, and one certainly wants to consider all of these and relate all of them to motivic considerations.) 

I finally figured why the graph of my function always looks like the one above. However, it turns out that this is no general property of rank one matrices, but strongly depends on sparsity of the vectors $v_1$ and $v_2$ that in my situation always is valid. The fully formal discussion of the matter now takes about 5 pages, which I will not write down in full detail here. However, I will sketch the main idea: Let us assume $v_1=e_j$ and $v_2=e_{j'}$ where $e_i$ is the $i$-th unit vector, which is my situation. The argument below would also work for vectors that are different to zero at two identical entries. For three or more entries it is still possible, but the complexity increases exponentially. Now let $P$ a permutation matrix that exchanges the columns $j$ and $j'$ to the last two columns of $v^T_1P$ and $Pv^T_2$. Then $$ \tilde Q^T F(x)P=\tilde R P+xu_1v^T_1P+xu^T_2v^T_2P=\tilde RP+xu_1e^T_{n-1}+xu_2e^T_{n} $$ is upper triangluar everywhere but the remaining two rows. Now we can find a matrix $\hat Q$ such that $$ \hat Q\begin{bmatrix}u_1&u_2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} ?_n & ?_n \\ 0_{m-n} & e_1\end{bmatrix}\qquad \text{and} \qquad \hat Q\tilde R=\tilde R $$ where $?_n$ are arbitrary but known vectors in $R^n$. Then $$ \hat Q\tilde Q^T F(x)P=\tilde RP+x\hat Qu_1e^T_{n-1}+x\hat Qu_2e^T_{n} $$ only differs at two entries from upper triangular. Those entries now can be eliminated using two Givens Rotations depending on $x$. This requires some effort but is absolutely doable with symbolic reformulations. Altogether we found a $QRP$ decomposition of $F(x)$ that only depends in two Givens rotations on $x$. Evaluating the norm in my optimization problem (that is not bothered by the matrix $P$) I get a rational function with numerator and denominator of degree 2. 

A footnote in hep-th/0411238 explains: "E. Calabi has constructed an explicit Kahler–Einstein metric on del Pezzo 6 – recall that this is the blow–up of $\mathbb{CP}_2$ at 6 points – with a certain symmetric configuration of the 6 blown–up points. The corresponding Sasaki–Einstein metric on #6$(S2 × S3)$ is thus also explicit. This metric has apparently never been published" What is the explicit form of this metric? 

The following conjecture is motivated by two different presentations of the affine cone over Grassmannian $Gr(2,6).$ One as a GIT quotient of $Hom(\mathbb{C}^2, \mathbb{C}^6)//SU(2)$ and the other as an affine variety defined by ${6 \choose 2} = 15$ Plucker coordinates, ${4 \choose 2} = 15$ Plucker relations, and ${6 \choose 6} = 1$ syzygy. Any thoughts on its proof (or disproof), or how to "fix" the left-hand side to give a full equality would be appreciated. Conjecture: The coefficients of $t^{4k}, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ in the expansion of the LHS and RHS of $$ \frac{1}{(1- t^6)} \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint \frac{dz}{z} (1 - z^2) PE( i_E) = \frac{1}{(1- t^6)} \prod_{1\le i < j \le 6} \frac{\left( 1- u_i^{-1} u_j^{-1} t^4 \right)}{(1-u_i u_j t^2)} + t^6 + t^{12} +t^{24} -\frac{t^{48}}{\left(t^{12}-1\right)^2}$$ agree, where $$i_E = t^6 \chi_3(z) + \left (t \chi_f(u) - t^5 \chi_{\bar{f}}(u) \right) \chi_2(z)$$ $$PE(i_E) = \frac{1}{(1 - t^6 z^2)(1 - t^6)(1 - t^6 z^{-2})} \prod_{1 \le i <j \le 6} \frac{(1 - t^5 z u_i^{-1} )(1 - t^5 z^{-1} u_i^{-1})}{(1 - tz u_i)(1 - t z^{-1} u_i)}$$ here $\chi_f(u) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} u_i, \qquad \chi_{\bar{f}}(u) = \sum_{i=1}^6 u_i^{-1}$ are the characters of the fundamental and anti-fundamental representations of $SL_6(\mathbb{C})$ and we have taken $\prod_{i=1}^{6} u_i = 1.$ $\chi_3(z) = z^2 + 1 + z^{-2}, \qquad \chi_2(z) = z + z^{-1}$ are the characters of the adjoint and fundamental representations of $SU(2).$ The Haar measure on $SU(2)$ is $\frac{1}{2 \pi i} \oint \frac{dz}{z} (1 - z^2)$. The integral simply picks off the coefficient of $z^{-1}$ in the series expansion in $t,z$. There are some similarities with the elliptic beta integral of Spiridonov and its degenerations to the Nassrallah-Rahman and Askey-Wilson integrals. However, it isn't obvious if they can be applied. 

Suppose I have a polynomial $$ p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n p_ix^i. $$ For simplicity furthermore assume $p_n=1$. As it is well known we may use Gershgorin circles to give an upper bound for the absolute values of the roots of $p(x)$. The theorem states that all roots are contained within a circle with radius $$ r=\max\{|p_0|, 1+|p_1|,\ldots, 1+|p_{n-1}|\}. $$ 

Just a rough idea: (I am not really an expert on graph theory, so there may be a much better upper bound.) You can group the vertices according to their distance to $s$, say $L_i=\{v\in V|dist(s,v)=i\}$ Then of course the $L_i$ are pairwise disjoint. Any shortest path from $s$ to a given vertex $v$ has to pass the $L_i$ ascending (you can easily proof this fact), so first a vertex from $L_1$, then one from $L_2$, and so on. That means there are at most $\prod_{i=1}^{dist(s,v)-1}|L_i|$ shortest paths. As $|L_i|\leq |V|$, you have a polynomial upper bound. While thinking about it: There might be a way to press this bound much lower, as $|L_i|=|V|$ only happens when all vertices have distance 1, which means the shortest path is the direct connection between $s$ and $v$. For decreasing amount of vertices in the $L_i$, the possible length of the path grows. You probably could use this to get a better bound. I do not see why the rest of your algorithm should not work. 

[Added: Just to set the scene, this answer is discussing the $p$-adic etale cohomology of a variety $X$ over a finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ (or, a little more generally, a finite extension of the fraction field of the Witt vectors of a perfect field of char. $p$).] Crystalline implies semi-stable implies de Rham implies Hodge-Tate. The cohomology is crystalline if $X$ is proper with a smooth model, is semi-stable if $X$ is proper with a semi-stable model, and is de Rham always. (In the proper case, the last statement is a theorem of Tsuji; in the general case, of Kisin. The crystalline and semi-stable cases are due, in various degrees of generality, to Fontaine--Messing, Hyodo--Kato, Faltings, and Tsuji.) Added: It might help to note that de Rham and potentially semi-stable coincide (as discussed in the comments below, Berger reduced this to a result in the theory of $p$-adic differential equations, which was then proved independently by Andre, Kedlaya, and Mebkhout). Also, unramified is a very strong condition in this setting ($p$-adic etale cohomology of varieties over $p$-adic fields), which essentially never holds unless we are looking just at $H^0$, and if the geometrically connected components of $X$ are defined over an unramified extension.

Witten's proof of the positive energy theorem using spinors drastically simplified the original proof by Schoen and Yau. 

Ginsparg's Applied Conformal Field Theory (hep-th/9108028 section 7.6) has a nice proof of the Jacobi Triple-Product formula and Euler's pentagonal number theorem. The equalities can be interpreted as the equivalence between the partition function of a free chiral boson and the partition function of two chiral fermions on a torus. This is an example of bosonization and plays an important role in string theory. The proof can be explained without any reference to physics, but the crucial difference in statistics (Boson/Fermion) employed in the proof becomes obscured. 

Given a Fano threefold $X$, its index $ind(X)$ is the largest integer $r$ such that there exists a divisor $H$ such that $rH \cong -K_X$. Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the associated (ample) line bundle and define the twisted forms $\Omega^q(k) = \Omega^q \otimes \mathcal{L}^k$. When do the twisted cohomology groups $H^p(X, \Omega^q(k))$ vanish? The Kodaira-Nakano vanishing theorem states that the cohomology groups vanish for $p+q > 3.$ For simple examples such as $\mathbb{CP}^3$ and the quadric hypersurface, many more of the twisted cohomology groups vanish. What results are known? Can anything stronger be said if $X$ has a Kahler-Einstein metric? Added: There are few scattered results in the literature. For example: The only two threefolds with non-vanishing $H^0(X, \Omega^1_X (1))$ are the Mukai–Umemura threefold $V_{22}$ and $V_{18}$ [math.AG/0310390]. 

The quantity that you are asking about (i.e. $\chi(X,\mathcal O_X)$) is closely related to the arithmetic genus (namely, the arithmetic genus is equal to $(-1)^{\dim X}(\chi(X,\mathcal O_X)-1)$), and so you will probably have better luck searching for "birational invariance of arithmetic genus". Doing so, one finds for example the following link, which states that over a field of char. $0$, the arithmetic genus is birationally invariant. I'm not sure whether the situation in char. $p$ has improved since that article was written. 

Yes, you are correct. The point is that a $p$-group acting in char. $p$ always has a fixed point (and so acts trivially on an irrep.). So every irrep. of $G$ in char. $p$ factors through $G'$, as you anticipated. The proof of the claim about $p$-groups is not hard. One approach (in general, even when $P$ is not nec. abelian) is to prove it by induction on the order of $P$, and so (using the fact that the descending central series is non-trivial) reduce to the case when $P$ is cyclic of order $p$. In this case, one can for example look at the group ring $k[P] = k[t]/(t^p - 1) = k[t-1]/(t-1)^p,$ and observe that it has a unique maximal ideal, and hence that $P$ has a unique irrep., namely the trivial one.
