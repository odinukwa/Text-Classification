Now, in the orbital plane, the radius of the planet orbit is given as $$ r(\nu) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos(\nu)} $$ If I define the x-axis to align with the ascending node, I can write the position vector as $$ \vec{r}_{orb} = r(\nu) \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega+\nu) \\ \sin(\omega+\nu) \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} $$ To move to a Cartesian coordinate system aligned with the invariable plane I have to apply a rotation of angle $i$ about the x-axis, so $$ \vec{r} = R_x(i)\vec{r}_{orb}= r(\nu) \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\omega+\nu) \\ \sin(\omega+\nu)\cos(i) \\ \sin(\omega+\nu)\sin(i) \end{bmatrix} $$ So now I have an expression for $r_z$, I just need to know how $\nu$ relates to the planet longitude in the invariable plane, $\lambda_{planet}$. I can find the longitude of the planet relative to $\lambda_{asc}$ as $$ \lambda'_{planet} = \arctan( \frac{r_y}{r_x} ) $$ such that the actual longitude is $$ \lambda_{planet} = \lambda_{asc} + \lambda'_{planet} $$ Inverting this last expression gives $$ \nu(\lambda) = \arctan( \frac{\tan(\lambda - \lambda_{asc})}{\cos(i)} ) - \omega $$ Now I have all the equations to answer the question: If the planet is along the observer's line of sight, then is has a true anomaly of $\nu(\lambda_{obs})$, which gives a height above the plane $$ r_z(\nu) = r(\nu)\sin(\omega+\nu)\sin(i) $$ If $|r_{z}| < R_{sun}$ the planet can be seen in transit. 

Consider a binary system with a neutron star and a companion star. It is fair to assume that the two stars have had tidal interaction, such that their angular momentum is aligned. This is just saying that both stars rotate in the same direction as their orbital motion. Now say that the companion is filling its Roche Lobe and steadily transferring mass into the gravitational potential of the neutron star. At this point there are two things we need to realize 

Additionally, you could only see the gas shell forever, if never again any other matter would fall in and conceal it. The hailstone analogy in the answer by John Duffield illustrates this behavior of the event horizon growing by passing through the accreting matter quite nicely. 

Utterly unknown. So Hawking proposed radiation, that reduces the mass of the black hole (BH) by black body radiation. The effective temperature is antiproportional to the mass of the BH. In the linked paper, Hawking concludes that BHs end in "fairly small explosions by astronomical standards." There are different solutions to the equations of general relativity that produce black holes, not only the common Schwarzschild metric. Whether the curvature singularity or the event horizon vanish before the BH completely evaporates, depends on the internal structure of the BH. As any mass, even very small ones, can become BHs if you compress them enough, there might be a singularity until the very end (not taking into account quantum mechanics). On the other hand a "vanishing event horizon" is not something we should be strictly speaking about, because then it wasn't an event horizon in the first place. You may see the looming problems with black hole remnants. Also: according to the no-hair theorem, BHs are completely characterized by mass, electric charge and angular momentum. If you can see a remnant, e.g. a clump of matter, could you derive its complete properties from the previous three only? In research, a remnant seems to be generally undesired but possible. This fresh and unreviewed paper jumps on the bandwagon and proposes white holes as remnants. So the debate about the end of BHs and their information theoretical implications is still a hot topic. Disclaimer: I'm not a BH specialist. (And I'm waiting for the time where "black hole specialist" is a craft job designation.) 

So I just had a quick question and I was wondering how we convert other waves of the electromagnetic spectrum to visible light waves. For example we use X-ray's or radio waves to see things in space like nebulae that we wouldn't normally be able to see with just visible light waves. But how do we convert those waves to visible light so we can actually see them. I don't know if I'm staying this right but another example that just came to me is pictures of the Sun we see that was taken with radio waves, we see them, which must mean that they were covered into visible light some how, so I was just wondering how, thanks in return =) 

Since Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system and is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium, (the gases the Sun uses to create energy), how come it didn't form as far out as say Uranus or Neptune since when our star formed it took most of the gases around it to create? Just a little confused on this, thanks for the help! 

So I was wondering how astronomers are able to get the texture/detail of an exoplanet or how they know a planet has water or not. I know how they discover planets by using the light of a star and seeing if it gets faint or by seeing if the star is getting gravitationaly pulled back and forth, to determine the planet size. But I just don't understand how they are able to get the texture of a planet. Thanks for the help!
