In his thesis Ira Gessel provides a method which gives a combinatorial interpretation of the inverse of a counting series of a linked set. A counting series is a generalization of a generating function. Some applications on the technique in the thesis are to things like symmetric functions and formal power series in countably many variables. For the single variable case, see Theorem 4.5 on page 45 which computes the inverse of a single variable generating function for some lattice paths. I will breifly summarize and give some simple examples below to make this answer a little more self-contained. Let $P$ be a set and $S \subseteq P^*$ be a subset of the free monoid (we actually want $S$ be a linear system which is defined in the thesis). For any $V \subseteq S$ we define its conuting series to be $\Gamma(V) = \sum_{\alpha \in V} \alpha$ which is a formal sum. We also define the alternating counting series $\bar{\Gamma}(V) = \sum_{\alpha \in V} (-1)^{r(\alpha)} \alpha$ where $r(\alpha)$ is the number of prime factors in $\alpha$ (i.e. length of the word). For any $\alpha = a_1a_2 \cdots a_n$ the links of $\alpha$ are $a_i a_{i+1}$. Take some set a links $L \subseteq P^2$ and define $C$ to be the set of $\alpha \in S$ such that all links of $\alpha$ are in $L$. Also let $\bar{C}$ be the set of $\alpha \in S$ such that all links of $\alpha$ are not in $L$. On page 37 we have Theorem 4.1 (The Inversion Theorem) we states $\Gamma(C) \bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1$. Now let's use this for some single variable generating functions. For a trivial example let $S = P^*$ where $P$ is a set of size $k$. Then let $L = P^2$. In this case $\Gamma(C) = \sum_{w \in P^*} w$ is the sum of all $k$-ary words and $\bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1 - \sum_{a \in P} a$. If we subsitute $a = x$ for all $a \in P$ we get the $\Gamma(C)$ becomes $\sum_{n \geq 0} k^n x^n$ and $\bar{\Gamma}({\bar{C}})$ becomes $1 - kx$. For a less trivial example let $S = P^* = \{a,b\}^*$ and let $L = \{aa,ab,ba\}$. Then $\Gamma(C)$ is the sum of all binary words which have no consecutive $b$'s and $\bar{\Gamma}(\bar{C}) = 1 - a - b + b^2 - b^3 + \cdots$. Again substituting $a = b = x$ we have $$1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 5x^3 + \cdots = \frac{1}{1 - 2x + x^2 - x^3 + \cdots}$$ the inverse of an "almost" Fibonacci generating function. 

In the char $p$ setting, it seems that CM-type is now a description of the action of the maximal commutative subgroup of $End_{\mathbb{Q}_p}(B)$. 

Every formal group is isomorphic to $\oplus_i G_{n_i,m_i}$ up to isogeny. Every such $G_{n,m}$ (pick any coprime m, n) can be realized in the formal group decomposition associated to an abelian variety. 

I am attempting to calculate the period matrix of the Riemann surface associated to the zero set of a complex curve: $y^3 = x^4 -1$. Background: It is my understanding that the period matrix of a Riemann surface is defined as $\int_{\gamma_i} \omega_j$, where $\omega_1, ..., \omega_g$ are a choice of basis of the invariant differentials of the surface, and $\gamma_1, ..., \gamma_{2g}$ are a choice of basis for $H_1(S)$. I have calculated an invariant differential basis as $dx/y, dx/y^2, xdx/y^2$. 

In short, I still don't know over a general ring, but for $\mathbb{F}_q$, we have an answer: The idempotent completion of the essential image of $AbVar_{/\mathbb{F}_q}$ in $FG_{/\mathbb{F}_q}$ is categorically equivalent to $FG_{/\mathbb{F}_q}$. In Manin's paper, The Theory of Formal Commutative Groups over Fields of Finite Characteristic, he calls formal groups "algebroid" if they are the completion of algebraic varieties over any field $k$. He proves that every formal group over $\mathbb{F}_q$ is isogenous to a subgroup of an algebroid formal group over $\mathbb{F}_q$. The proof outline is: 

In ScrewBox: a Randomized Certifying Graph-Non-Isomorphism Algorithm by Kutz and Schweitzer it is stated that "It is generally accepted that the incidence graphs of finite projective planes confront graph isomorphism algorithms with great challenges." Also the PhD Thesis of Schweitzer discusses difficult graphs (including incidence graph of projective planes) in section 2.8. I do not know any repository of adjacencies of these graph, but Moorhouse has data online for known projective planes of order 27 online. Also the paper of Kutz and Schweitzer as well as the thesis of Schweitzer both cite data that Royle has on projective planes on order 16 but that link seems to broken for me right now. 

I don't think your diagram is coming from a skew-symmetrizable matrix. Let $B$ be a skew-symmetrizable matrix and assume $Q = \Gamma(B)$ so your quiver is the diagram of $B$ as defined in Definition 7.3 of the linked paper. Then we must have $$B = \begin{bmatrix}0 & x & y \\ \frac{-1}{x} &0 & z \\ \frac{-1}{y} & \frac{-2}{z} &0 \end{bmatrix}$$ with $x,y,z > 0$. There also must exist a diagonal matrix $D = \mathrm{diag}(r,s,t)$ with $r,s,t > 0$ so that $$DB = \begin{bmatrix}0 & rx & ry \\ \frac{-s}{x} &0 & sz \\ \frac{-t}{y} & \frac{-2t}{z} &0 \end{bmatrix}$$ is skew-symmetric. So, $rx = \frac{s}{x}$, $ry = \frac{t}{y}$, and $sz = \frac{2t}{z}$ or equivalently $x^2 = \frac{s}{r}$, $y^2 = \frac{t}{r}$, and $z^2 = \frac{2t}{s}$. But this leads to a contradiction since $\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{y^2}{x^2} = \frac{t}{s}$, but also $z^2 = 2\left(\frac{t}{s}\right)$. All the variables above aren't completely necessary. Since all entries of $B$ are integers we see $x = y = 1$ and $z = 1$ or $z = 2$. Then then follows $r = s = t$ and the contradiction is $z^2 = 2$. 

There is a transition in the theory of complex multiplication which seems to be glossed over in all expositions I can find. I would like to explicitly find a theorem that allows me to do this. Background: Let us review the construction of a complex abelian variety $A$ with complex multiplication by $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_N)$ given by Taniyama-Shimura. We begin with $\mathbb{C}^g/\Phi(\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_N])$ equipped with a Riemann form, where the embedding is given by: $$\Phi: \mathbb{Z}[\zeta_N] \to \mathbb{C}^g$$ $$a \mapsto (\sigma_1(a),..., \sigma_g(a))$$ where $\sigma_1, ..., \sigma_g$ are nonconjugate embeddings of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_N) \to \mathbb{C}$. There is an action of $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_N] =: L$, a commutative subgroup of $End_{\mathbb{Q}}(A)$ on the holomorphic tangent space of $A$. This action is defined by taking $$\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_N] \to End_{\mathbb{Q}}(A)$$ $$\alpha \times (z_1, ..., z_g) \mapsto (\sigma_1(\alpha)z_1, ..., \sigma_g(\alpha)z_g)$$ This action, the $CM$-type of $A$ gives a spectral decomposition of $\text{Lie } A$ (the holomorphic tangent space at the identity). 

At the beginning of the section in the paper they let $G$ be a hypergraph. The size of a (hyper)edge is the number of vertices it contains. 

The $g$-conjecture (or $g$-theorem in the polytopal case) aims the characterize what possible $f$-vectors can arise from simplicial spheres. Here is some nice history and introduction to the $g$-conjecture by Gil Kalai. In brief the $g$-conjecture says that for a simplicial sphere the $h$-vector should be symmetric and the $g$-vector should be an $M$-vector where $g_i = h_i - h_{i-1}$. 

No, this algorithm does not always produce a matching that is within a factor 2 of the optimal matching. Consider $G = (V,E)$ with $$\begin{align*} V &= \{x,y\} \uplus \{z_1, z_2, \dots, z_k\}\\ E &= \{xz_1, yz_1, yz_2, \dots, yz_k\} \end{align*}$$ and weights $$\begin{align}w(xz_1) &= m \\ w(yz_1) &= M \\ w(yz_i) &= \epsilon & i > 1 \end{align}$$ for small $\epsilon$, large $k$ and $M$, and moderate $m.$ For $M$ large enough the maximal weight matching is simply $\{yz_1\}$ which has weight $M$. The normalized edge weights are $$\begin{align}w(xz_1) &= \frac{m}{3} \\ w(yz_1) &= \frac{M}{k+2} \\ w(yz_i) &= \frac{\epsilon}{k+1} & i > 1 \end{align}$$ and so for large enough $k$ the algorithm will first choose $xz_1.$ The alogrithm then removes $yz_1$ and will choose $yz_2$ at the next step to produce the matching $\{xz_1, yz_2\}$ with weight $m + \epsilon.$ We can choose $k$, $\epsilon$, $m$, and $M$ so that $M > 2(m+ \epsilon).$
