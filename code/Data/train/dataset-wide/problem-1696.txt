like the previous, $S/N$ is proportional to $t^{1/2}$ $$\frac{S}{N}\Bigg|_{\rm obj}=\frac{f_{\lambda}t^{1/2}\sqrt{A_{\rm eff}\Delta\lambda\eta_{\lambda}}}{\sqrt{\mu_{\lambda}A_B}} $$ Where $\mu$ is surface brightness and $A_B$ is the background area. 

Since the question is actually asking for a size of Jupiter as seen from Mars, there is a very simple equation that will give you a good idea. $$\frac{\alpha}{360^{\circ}}=\frac{\ell}{2\pi r} $$ $\alpha$ is the angle that Jupiter would subtend in the sky, or the angular size, and $\ell$ is the actual diameter, or linear size, of Jupiter. $2\pi r$ is the circumference of Jupiter's orbit about Mars. Now I know what you're thinking, that this doesn't make any sense because of the vast differences of Jupiter's orbit when it is close compared to when it is at opposition. It'll work out... The following are all approximations. Mars orbits the Sun at $\sim1.53AU$ and Jupiter at $\sim5.2AU$. Because $1AU \approx 150Mkm$, The difference in their orbits are roughly $550.5Mkm$. $$\alpha=\frac{140000km}{2\pi(550.5\times10^6km)}\times360^{\circ}=0.015^{\circ} $$ That is just the average angular size, at the average closest distance, but given that the only real tool to measure angular size with the naked eye (that isn't a sextant) is your hand, and your smallest digit (the pinky) at arms length marks out $1^{\circ}$ you'll never be able to tell the difference in the variation of size due to the change in distance. Now answering your other questions directly: 

I will edit this with the appropriate equations and timeframes in a few hours when I get back to my office. For now I will address the foundations of your questions with some basics. 1: The radius of the frost line is determined by the star itself (edit: More precisely the nebula that the star forms from.), more in-depth answer will come with edit. 2: The fact that most of the data for these systems is from methods that favour large planets close to the parent star, means that our selection isn't biased, but the method instrument combination is. Another possibility is that migration and loss of angular momentum could be the culprits in this scenario. It is also worth noting, that in the next decade there should be significant data to state whether our solar system is actually common, an anomaly or just younger than many of the other solar systems observed thus far. 3: Larger gas giants "Jovian" planets like all orbiting objects migrate inwards as they loose angular momentum. During the oligarchic growth phase of a soon to be large planet the forming core accrets a lot of material while clearing "all" of the material within it's orbit and associated jeans radius, as the core migrates inwards the supply of material is once again increased. In short that is why there are "Gas Giants" within the frost line, things migrate inward as they loose angular momentum, and "Ice Giants" form beyond the line because they took too long to migrate inward and gather enough material to move to the next level. Also, if the protoplanet takes too long to accret a ~10-15 earth-mass core, all of the accretable material will be ejected from the system by the star before any significant atmosphere can be obtained. The dwarf planet part, has to do with the amount of material and how long the protoplanet took to accret it. In that respect, the ice giants and the dwarf planets share a common shortcoming. 

Google-fu is correct... It really depends upon where you are, for an exact time. However, if you understand that there are 8 named phases and they typically have a "standard" rise time, you can know approximately what time and what phase will be visible. The one caveat is that you need to look at the moon to know where to start. 

To avoid the shake, set as long of a timer as you can! I'm not sure if the newer pen cameras have the option for the tethered remote, but mine definitely does not. As for the software, I wrote some python codes that I use for image processing, and DS9 is the interface that I use regularly, however good old photoshop (pre-everythingisstupidandcloudbased) really works wonders if you're on a budget and have or "find" a copy laying about. p.s. the adapter is from telescopeadapters.com 

My issue with this statement, lies in the facts that the eventual heat death of the universe is not so much a transcendental theory so much as it is a thermodynamic law. The heat death of the universe is more closely attached to the lifetime of stars in the universe than the cooling of an evenly distributed temperature throughout space. As galaxies age, they contain less and less star forming regions, thereby creating less and less stars. Less stars means less heat, and when the final stars and white dwarfs die and cool off respectively the entirety of the universe will finally be able to reach 0K. This is no insignificant timescale, keep in mind that WDs take about $10^{13}$ years just to cool from their initial states down to a temperature where they will no longer emit visible light, which means they could take another $10^{20}$ years to reach anything close to zero kelvin. Regarding the even distribution of temperature. Space already has a fairly homogeneous distribution of heat ~2.7K it's called the CMB, and it has been cooling since the big bang, and there is no source of heat that will allow for an increase of this temperature on a whole, or in one word... entropy. Space is far too vast and heat sources are far too ... far ... apart to ever affect anything other than extremely local conditions. Now for the end of time issue. The idea of time involves the transmission of information. For example, if you send a radio transmission to the moon and back, you will state that some time has passed from the sending to the receiving of the transmission. This process is possible because there is a temperature above 0K, for the electromagnetic waves to propagate. Meaning that when the temperature of all space reaches 0K, there will be no energy available for electromagnetic waves to propagate. Thus no information can be transmitted, and time ... is at a standstill. Therefore, the universe would not end by time stopping, because time stopping is a by product of the "universe ending" because its heat death.

Black holes orbit things and galaxies move within space, so it would be safe to assume that black holes move through space-time and do not hold it in any particular state or position. They simply drag their "depression" along with them as they go. 

I will answer all of your points with zero tact and/or precision in order to fit them all in. 1) It will take you about a "split second" given you stated that it only takes your brother a split second to travel from Earth to the point 13Bly away and back again. He will be exactly said split second older and no more, because as he is traveling faster than the speed of light, the rules governing his and your aging no longer apply, meaning you have created a scenario where both his and your time's are connected and simultaneous. 2) At the point when you meet up with your brother a split second later, the universe will be a split second older... At the time you've reached your destination the universe will be [ > 13By + (the age of the universe when you left) ]. The fact that your ship takes one year to accelerate to and from the top speed is irrelevant given the duration of the travel time. 3) .999c ... Why not, assuming that you have enough "fuel" your imaginary ship should be more than capable than making a single one way trip. There given the distance and time it would take you to get there, there is close to zero reason to accelerate either sooner or later, although the whole near speed of light travel is sort of the point of your question, it would kind of be necessary. 4) The N times scenario is redundant and a little weirder than your other questions, as the speed of light is the same in all reference frames, you would never breach that boundary, however to each previous ship the rate of travel would appear exponential even though there would only be infinitesimal gains. Would you ever reach free space... no, without faster than light travel it is not possible. I would venture a guess that space would look somewhat similar to the here and now regardless where you ended up within your lifetime. a) by tinker, you could assume that you were able to travel as fast as your twin in part (1). b) Think Star Trek, impulse power was sub light speed travel, all warp speeds are some large multiple of c. Look into relative simultaneity and space-time diagrams for reference on the whole twin paradox issue. Also you could read something like ... the physics of star trek for faster than light travel scenarios with actual physics explanations or problems. 

As it has been mentioned in a comment by @zephyr, the infinite time issue is actually a non-issue. As you move closer to a black hole, the relative time to your point of view doesn't change in the same way that it does from a different reference frame. Looking at your own situation, everything would happen in "real time" however, everything observed about you and your situation would take "and infinite amount of seconds for one second to pass." This is also a contested issue because there have been measurements and possibly observations (I'd have to fact check this) of stars "falling" into black holes. So the infinite time from the outside observers perspective is also not possible. In short, the best way to answer your question without going to much into theory, hypotheticals, or mad science, is simply to state: No, it does not mean that. 

Gravity, according to the majority of published and non-published scientists, is able to propagate information from one point to another at the speed of light. This means that as soon as any massive body "physically" interacts with a black hole (enters the Schwartzchild radius) there is no longer a way for anything outside of the black hole to know anything else regarding the status of the body. Therefore the new addition to the black hole simply becomes part of the system and can no longer be considered a separate entity. The body's gravity becomes that of the black hole's. So... No 

Another option, which might be a TON easier, depending upon the reason you're trying to calculate the $S/N$... For HST and Keck, there is software on their respective sites, that estimates the $S/N$ for an observation, is intended to capture all of the factors for a given instrument+telescope (ie: $\eta_{\lambda}$, $A_{\rm eff}$). 

which means that your $S/N$ is proportionate to the exposure time $t$. $$\frac{S}{N}\Bigg|_{\rm RN}=\frac{f_{\lambda}A_{\rm eff}\Delta\lambda\eta_{\lambda}/h\nu)t}{\sigma_{\rm RN}} $$ where $f$ is the specific flux, $A$ is the area of the primary mirror area, $\Delta\lambda$ is the wavelength range of your filter/optics, $\eta$ is the end-to-end efficiency of the system, $h\nu$ is your energy, $t$ is the exposure time, and $\sigma_{\rm RN}$ is the read noise error. 

When I first started out, I used my Olympus pen e-pl1, so you're doing great with the e-pl3. It takes higher resolution photos (330 vs 300 dpi) than my wife's Nikon D5300, so your camera should work just fine. I still whip this one out every now and again just because of its simplicity. The one on the right is the adapter that I use regularly. I mounts up easily to each of my telescopes. Works great and has held up nicely the last (almost) decade. 

I'll attempt to answer as many of these questions, to the best of my abilities, as I can at this late hour. 1) Lenses have an index of refraction that is different than vacuum, and air, and they are curved. ie: corners when light is concerned. 2) The entrance and exit pupils are the pupil size required to pass an "extreme" ray through an optic. Meaning that if the light ray from the optical axis was not refracted at all as it passed the optical plane, it would still pass within the pupil (entrance) and if reflected perfectly (exit). The diameters of the objective and the eyepiece are subjective, meaning that you can have, within reason, any size objective and use virtually any eyepiece. The restrictions to this would only be focal lengths. 3) You are looking through a thicker lens and thereby reducing the light incident on your eye. Think about the shape of the lenses, look at them and it might become apparent just how much more curvature the 4mm lens has than the 20mm lens. This added curvature comes at the cost of a higher angle of incident that a light ray has to take, and thus more optic to pass through. 4) Barlow lenses reduce the brightness a lot because you are adding additional optics. With each new addition you decrease the amount of light by a factor relative to the thickness and clarity of the optics. The Barlow lens is increasing the magnification and thereby reducing the field of view. 5) With your specific telescope (of which I have one with the exact same size/focal length) you should be able to see Jupiter as a disk, Mars too should be more than a "dot." Stars are point sources with angular diameters much too small for you to be concerned given the size of your telescope. Also, those planets appear reddish because they are-ish. Many stars will still appear colors other than blue if you can find them. 6) This is up to your discretion and desired results when observing.
