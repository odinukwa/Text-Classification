The Alon-Tarsi Conjecture: A latin square of order $n$ is a filling of an $n\times n$ matrix with the numbers $1, 2,\ldots,n$ such that each row or column gives a permutation of $1,2,\ldots,n$. Take the product of the signs of these $2n$ permutations and call it the sign of the latin square. Let $EVEN(n)$ be the number of latin squares with sign $+1$ and let $ODD(n)$ be the number of latin squares with sign $-1$. The conjecture says: If $n$ is even then $EVEN(n)\neq ODD(n)$. The original reference is: N. Alon and M. Tarsi, Colorings and orientations of graphs, Combinatorica 12 (1992), 125-134. See also this preprint by Landsberg and Kumar for a recent update. 

Edit: My understanding above of the OP's question was that only one mass $m$ is present, in which case the only possibilities are $m=0$ or $m=\infty$. I should add however, given the comments by Marcel and Logan, that another possibility is to have a continuous spectrum of masses present. In fact this is the most common situation in CFT. For a field $\phi$ with scaling dimension $\Delta\in\left(\frac{d-2}{2},\frac{d}{2}\right)$ the Euclidean two-point function is up to constant factors $$ \langle\phi(x)\phi(y)\rangle\sim\frac{1}{|x-y|^{2\Delta}}\sim \int \frac{d\xi}{(2\pi)^d}e^{i\xi(x-y)}\frac{1}{|\xi|^{d-2\Delta}} $$ $$ \sim\int \frac{d\xi}{(2\pi)^d}e^{i\xi(x-y)}\left(\int_0^{\infty} m^{2\Delta-d+1}\frac{dm}{\xi^2+m^2}\right) $$ $$ = \int_0^{\infty}dm\ m^{2\Delta-d+1}\ \left(-\Delta+m^2\right)^{-1}(x,y)\ . $$ The last formula is the explicit form of the Källén-Lehmann representation mentioned in Marcel's comment. By a theorem of Pohlmeyer, CFTs which do not have this kind of continuous mass spectrum must be free. So in that sense, this third option is the most common one in the physics literature. 

Edit2: For the statement about no other relation than $(det(X))^2=\ldots$ this can be done easily with symmetric functions of the eigenvalues. Basically one has to show there are no nonzero polynomials $P$ and $Q$ in the even power sums $p_2,p_4,\ldots$ such that $Q\ e_n=P$ where $e_n$ is the determinant,i.e., the $n$-th elementary symmetric function. Then write the expansion of $e_n$ in terms of power sums which contains $p_1^n$ and compare both sides as polynomials in $p_1$ with coefficients in the ring of polynomials in $p_2,p_3,\ldots,p_n$ . 

Can someone please clarify if there always exist regular neighborhoods for a properly embedded surface in a 3-manifold? More precisely, if $F$ is a properly embedded surface in a 3-manifold $M$ and I give a simplicial complex structure to $M$, then will $F$ automatically recieve a subcomplex structure (after probably finitely many barycentric subdivisions of the triangulation of $M$) ? If this is so, then we can obviously construct a regular neighborhood of $F$. But I am feeling unsure about it now due to the following example where $F$ might be too big to allow such a compatible subdivision of the triangulation of $M$: Example: Consider a mobius band without a contractible neighborhood in a genus 1 handlebody. One can construct one as follows: First take a solid cylinder $D^2\times{[-1,1]}$ and look at the central strip. Now glue the ends of the cylinder with $180$ degrees twist to make it a genus 1 handlebody. This will glue the central strip with a twist to make it a mobius band and it has no small neighborhood in the ambient genus 1 handlebody. It seems to me that this mobius band will not have a subcomplex structure for any given simplicial complex structure on the genus 1 handlebody. In case the answer to my question is yes, I would also like to ask if there are no issues regarding the orientability of $F$ and $M$ while considering regular neighborhoods. That is whether it matters for constructing such a neighborhood if $F$ is non-orientable but $M$ is orientable or vice-versa or other combinations. I am unable to clarify this by looking at Hempel's book on 3-manifolds. It would be great if someone could elucidate this. 

For any $n$ tuple $f_1,f_2,\dots,f_n$ in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n]$ one has Jacobian, expressed by the $(n \times n)$-determinants: $$ J(f_1,\dots,f_n):=|\frac{\partial}{\partial x_i}(f_j)|_{1 \leq i,j,\leq n} $$ And, one has for elementary symmetric polynomials $e_i$ of degree $i$, $$ J(e_1,e_2,\dots,e_n)=\prod_{1 \leq i,j,\leq n}(x_i-x_j)=\triangle $$ also for complete symmetric polynomials and power sum symmetric polynomials, one has a very nice formula for Jacobian, see the following link: $URL$ Question: Let $n \geq 4$. Is the similar results also known for minors of Jacobian of symmetric polynomials (complete symmetric polynomials). Remark: For power sum and elementary symmetric polynomials, one can derive easily, I am looking for complete symmetric polynomials. 

I have a positive reference to your question under special case: Let $I=(x_1^{d+1},x_2^{d+1},\dots,x_n^{d+1})$ be a monomial complete intersection ideal in the polynomial ring $R=\mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. Easy to see $I$ is fixed by group $G=S_n$. So $S_n$ acts on the quotients ring $A=R/I$. we see $A^G=R^G/I^G$, where $R^G=\mathbb{C}[e_1,\dots,e_n]$, is the ring of symmetric functions and $I^G=I \cap R^G$. You are looking for $I \cap R^G$. See the paper $URL$ by Aldo Conca, Christian Krattenthaler, Junzo Watanabe. In this paper they show that $I \cap R^G$ is generated by power sum symmetric polynomials $p_{d+1},p_{d+2},\dots,p_{d+n}$. Treatment here is only for $I=(x_1^{d+1},x_2^{d+1},\dots,x_n^{d+1})$. But I hope, this would help. 

In the proof of Eric Naslund: I would like to add few more things. I like the answer of Eric. As Eric pointed out $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x-\alpha_i}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{1}{x-\beta_i}$ if and only if ${Q}^{\prime}(x)=0$. What I want to say is ${Q}^{\prime}(x)$ may or may not have solution. And so, one may or may not have solution of $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x-\alpha_i}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{1}{x-\beta_i}$. For example: Take $m=1$ and $n=2$. one has ${Q}(x)=\frac{(x-\alpha_1)(x-\alpha_2)}{(x-\beta_1)}$. Then ${Q}^{\prime}(x)=\frac{x^2-2\beta_1 x+\beta_1(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)-\alpha_1\alpha_2}{(x-\beta_1)^2}$. So ${Q}^{\prime}(x)=0$ if and only if $x^2-2\beta_1 x+\beta_1(\alpha_1+\alpha_2)-\alpha_1\alpha_2=0$. The real roots of this depends on the choice of $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta_1$, which makes discriminants greater than or equal to zero. I have considered an elementary case, and still hope for finding roots is so dificult. In general, It seems difficult to find solution of $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{x-\alpha_i}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\frac{1}{x-\beta_i}$. However, theoretically answer lies on the roots of ${Q}^{\prime}(x)=0$, but practically, It seems hard. 

This is part of classical invariant theory: the study of joint invariants of several quadratic forms. As far as I know these rings of invariants are only known in a few special cases. There has been work by Turnbull and Todd for the $n=3$ case. A recent paper on the subject which contains pointers to the classical literature is ``La théorie des invariants des formes quadratiques ternaires revisitée'' by Bruno Blind. 

Maybe: isotypical decomposition of the representation $L^2(\mathbb{R}^2,\mathbb{C})$ of the group $U(1)$ might do. 

I don't think Onsager's solution will help you in the presence of a magnetic field. In the low temperature regime there are rigorous expansions for pretty much all the quantities of interest. These go under the names of low temperature cluster expansions, contour expansions, Pirogov-Sinai theory (the most general theory for this kind of things). You can find presentations of these tools especially in the archetypal example of the Ising model in just about any book on Gibbs measures: e.g. the books by Malyshev and Minlos, Preston, Georgii, Sinai, etc. A good place to start is the lecture notes by Velenik. If you do not read French then look up the references in these lecture notes. 

If your model is the anharmonic oscillator $$ V=x^2+x^4 $$ one can do a simple unitary transformation based on scaling $x\rightarrow \lambda x$, $\frac{d}{dx}\rightarrow \lambda^{-1} \frac{d}{dx}$ to reduce your problem to that of the analyticity of $\sqrt{\hbar}E_n(\sqrt{\hbar})$ where $E_n(\beta)$ are the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $$ -\Delta+x^2+\beta x^4\ . $$ This has been studied for instance in B. Simon, "Coupling constant analyticity for the anharmonic oscillator", Ann. Phys. 58 (1970), 76-136. You might find the kind of methods you need in this article or in the ones referring to it, say on Google Scholar. 

To add to the excellent answers of jvp and David Speyer above: Actually Hartog's theorem does even better: Given a domain $U\subset\mathbb{C}^{n{\geq{2}}}$ and a compact $K\subset{U}$ such that $U\setminus{K}$ is just connected, any holomorphic function on $U\setminus K$ extends holomorphically to $U$. Note that we don't need the codimension condition. This is actually a simple consequence of Cauchy's formula in several variables. For algebraic geometry (resp. complex geometry) and dimension $\geq{2}$: The analog of Hartog's theorem is that any regular (resp. holomorphic) function on the complement of an algebraic (resp. analytic) subset of codimension atleast $2$ in a normal algebraic(resp. analytic) variety, extends to the whole algebraic (resp. analytic) variety. I would also like to point out the important difference between the affine (resp. Stein) case and the projective case as perhaps alluded to by jvp above. If $X$ is a projective algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and you find a holomorphic function $f$ on the complement of a divisor $D$ then you will not be able to extend the function to all of $X$ however hard you try(!) since there are no global non-constant functions on projective varieties (similar statement for compact analytic vars). So to add to jvp's answer (which might seem like hair-splitting but is important IMHO): His second paragraph must refer to a non-projective neighborhood of the contractible curve that he discusses, otherwise the argument is still true but only vacuously! This is because there is no non-constant function to be found on a projective surface on the complement of a contractible curve and hence there is nothing to extend! Moreover, it will not be possible in general to extend holomorphic functions from the complement of divisors whose examples can be easily constructed. So there is no hope in this direction without any local boundedness hypothesis.
