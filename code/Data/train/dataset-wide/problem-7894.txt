For a connection with "full rank" curvature matrix I think I have a more complete answer in form of an algorithm that verifies whether the connection is metric. This is partly based on an observation made by Robert Bryant so at least that part is 100% correct. Consider a connection $D$ in the vector bundle $E.$ We assume that the curvature matrix has " full rank"(I can elaborate on this condition on the curvature) on a open set $U.$ We'd like to verify if the connection is metric on $U.$ We have the following steps in deciding weather the connection $D$ is metric on $U$: 1.Take a local frame $\sigma=(\sigma_1, \sigma_2,...,\sigma_m )$ on $U$ and calculate the curvature matrix $\Omega$ with respect to this frame. 

My guess is that this is going to be hard to solve in reasonable time if you have a large number of dimensions (thousands or more), and don't exploit any particular 'nice' features your lattice might have. However, I believe it is in NP. The following, while probably impractical, should in theory do what you are asking: 1) Find a reduced lattice basis (LLL algorithm) 2) Use the reduced basis to enumerate all lattice points within a sufficiently large box encompassing the point "P". 3) Compute the Voronoi diagram of this set of points. (Bowyer-Watson algorithm) You should then be able to find the nearest lattice point by inspection of the Voronoi diagram. If you really need to compute this sort of thing, the trick would be to see if you can avoid step 1) completely, and integrate steps 2) and 3). Otherwise, simply storing the Voronoi diagram will use an explosive amount of memory. 

Determine the matrices $S_{ij}$(with real smooth functions as entries) defined by the equation $$ \Omega=\sum_{i<j} (\sigma^i \wedge \sigma^j) S_{ij} .$$ Form the linear system $$ XS_{ij}+S_{ij}^TX=0. $$ If the linear system from the previous step doesn't have a symmetric, positive definite solution $X=A$, the $D$ is not metric. If the solution $X=A$ exists then take its square root $\sqrt{A}=B$. Form the frame $\sigma'$ defined by $$\sigma'=\sigma B$$ and test whether the connection forms with respect to $\sigma'$ are skew. If they are not then the connection is not metric on $U$. If the connection forms with respect to $\sigma$ are skew, then the metric that makes $\sigma$ orthonormal is compatible with the connection. 

Consider applying the permutation (1,3,0,5,2,7,4,6) to the integers (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) three times. I call this a "dance of minimal cost" because all unordered pairs in {0..7} meet each other, and the total movement of all the "dancers" is minimal. For a pair to "meet" I simply mean that, at some point during the dance, they occupy adjacent positions. Say that n=8 in this case. Here is a crude illustration of the dance: 

An iterative scheme may do the trick. I would suggest looking into algorithms such as GMRES. Since you have a large, sparse matrix, there is a good chance you already have your matrix in a format that can be accepted by an iterative solver. 

For a smooth, real surface $\Sigma$, its bundle of symmetric, bi-linear forms $S^2T\Sigma$ reduced to a $PGL(2,\mathbb{R})$ structure. A similar reduction(with different structure group) can be done for other tensor bundles. 

Where can I find a good reference on this type of reductions? $PGL(2,\mathbb{R})$ acts by conjugation on the space of square matrices $M(3,\mathbb{R}).$ Can one find any invariant polynomials associated to this action? 

Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $SM$ be the bundle of symmetric bi-linear forms on $TM.$ Riemannian metrics are a particular kind of sections in this bundle. Since any manifold admits a global Riemannian metric it follows that the Euler class of $SM$ is zero. If $M$ is parallelizable then $SM$ is clearly trivial. Are there any manifolds where $SM$ is NOT trivial? 

It looks something like a braid. We can define the cost of a dance to be the sum of the distances by which each element is displaced. For the dance above, the cost is 42 (3 permutations x cost of 14 each). The permutation (1,3,0,5,2,7,4,6) has a cost of 14 since it displaces all 8 elements up or down by 2, except for the second and second-last elements which move up and down by a distance of 1. I should mention that the dance above is not unique, for example there are other dances on {0..7} which also have cost 42 but consist of different permutations, not repeated application of a single permutation as illustrated above. I am reasonably confident that the cost of 42 is minimal for the n=8 case but do not have a solid proof. The question I have is this: what can be said about dances of minimal (or approximately minimal) cost in the following restricted case: suppose we introduce a radius r, and require not that every pair of dancers meet, but only those initially within distance r of each other. For example, a dance on {0..7} with n=8, r=2 and initial configuration (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) does not need {2} and {5} to meet, since these are initially separated by a distance 3, greater than r. Edit: Can this notion of restriction be cast in the language of forbidden patterns, I wonder? 

Let $E→M$ be a plane bundle endowed with an almost complex structure $J.$ $J$ induces a natural positive definite inner product in the associated bundle $End(E)→M$,denoted by $<,>$. More precisely if $A,B \in End(E_p)$ then chose a frame $e_1,e_2$ in $E_p$ such that $$ J(e_1)=−e_2, J(e_2)=e_1.$$ This can always be done for an almost complex structure( I believe the name for such a frame is complex frame?). With respect to this frame the matrix of the endomrphism $A$ is $a_{ij}$ and the matrix of $B$ is $b{ij}.$ Define $$<A,B>=\sum_{ij}a_{ij}b_{ij}.$$ Now consider the set $$P=\{(p,A)| p∈M, A∈End(Ep), <A,J>=0, <A,id>=0,<A,A>=1\}$$ which is a circle fibration above $M.$ Are there any conditions on $J$ that will guarantee that $P$ is trivial?
