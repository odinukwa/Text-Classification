Side note: Optical depth is a measure of transparency of one medium; it measures how radiation is neither scattered nor absorbed by the medium. It expression is given by $$\frac{I}{I_0} = {\rm e}^{-\tau}$$ where $I_0$ is the source intensity, $I$ the observed intensity, and $\tau$ the optical depth. Sources: 

The three first points probably takes an almost equal amount of time for any astronomer; point 4 takes even more time for older astronomers; point 5 is also crucial for all the good things that come out of discussions over a good ol' bowl of coffeine. Complements: To answer to your comment and to give you an overview of the current research, I can think of: 

There is a carbon deficiency, that means that carbon abundance has no impact on the total oxygen budget; Elements Mg, Al, Si, Ca, are assumed to be carried as MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, and CaO at their maximum abundance, so once they had these abundances, they could substract it to the total oxygen budget; The remaining oxygen excess, found in FeO and debris, is interpreted as water-rich (if you want to form FeO, you need water somehow). 

If such a planet exists, WISE should observe it. WISE is an infrared satellite that imaged the entire sky. In particular: 

where $v'_{ext}$ and $v'_{int}$ are the velocity of the external and internal planetesimal in the reference fram of the proto-planet. That is why the rotation of the proto-planet tends to be in the same direction as the whole system. 

That's how they were able to determine this water abundance in debris around the white dwarf GD 61. I'm not sure the oxygen abundance would be very meaningful here, but since you asked for it, it is of -5.95+/-0.13 dex. 

Pluto: It was disqualified as a planet because orbital dominance was not achieved in the case of Pluto. Orbital dominance means that a the planet candidate should have remove all the small bodies from its orbit, by impact, capture of gravitational disturbance. Planet: According to the IAU in its resolution B5 (IAU is the International Astronomical Union; in particular it is in charge of naming celestrial bodies), a planet is a celestial body: 

Stars tend to twinkle for two main reasons: first, stars are very far away (the closest star is about 4 light-year from the Sun) and are therefore seen as point sources. Second, Earth has an atmosphere. Earth's atmosphere is turbulent, and therefore all images view through it tends to "swim". Therefore, sometimes a single point in "object space" is mapped to several points in "image space", and sometimes it is not mapped at all. Since stars are seen as single points, they sometimes seems brighter, sometimes even seems to disapear. If you look at it in another planet of our solar system, it will depends on the planet's own atmosphere. If you look at stars on Mars, the atmosphere being very thin, the stars won't twinkle that much. Same for Mercury. On Venus, the atmosphere is so thick than you won't see anything apart from the atmosphere itself (if you are not crunched by the atmosphere pressure, by the way...). 

The first thing to notice is that the Local Interstellar Cloud, in which the Sun is evolving right now, is a fairly diffuse region, with a typical density of about one to a few particles per cubic centimeters. Clouds with such low density are actually mostly atomic; as you can see on this plot (Snow & McCall 2006, adapted from Neufeld et al. 2005): 

There are such evidence in the case of Mars. Observations from Mars Global Surveyor show evidences of crustal magnetization. In particular, this magnetization has extensive, east-west trending linear features in Terra Cimmeria and Terra Sirenum. These are probably reminiscent of magnetic features associated with a reversing dipole. There are no such evidence in the case of Venus: Venus has no intrinsic magnetic field today (contrary to the common belief, its inability to maintain a dynamo activity is either due to its chemical and physical conditions unable to form a solid core, either du to an early complete core solidification; it is not due to its slow rotation), and could not have maintained a remanent crustal magnetization, because its crust would have been to hot during its dynamo activity (above the Curie point).

Angular momentum conservation To put it in more mathematical terms, you can play with the energy and the angular momentum of a bunch of particles orbinting a central mass $M$, given by $$E = \sum_i m_i \left(\frac{1}{2}v_i^2 - \frac{GM}{r_i}\right),$$ for the energy and $${\bf I} = \sum_i m_i {\bf r}_i \times {\bf v_i},$$ for the angular momentum. Now, let's try to extremize the energy for a given angular momentum, keeping in mind that the system has to conserve angular momentum, and that collisions between the particles can reduce the energy. One good way to do it is to use Lagrange multiplier $$\delta E - \lambda\cdot\delta {\bf I} = \sum_i\left[\delta {\bf v}_i \cdot \left({\bf v}_i - \lambda \cdot {\bf r}_i \right) + \delta {\bf r}_i \cdot \left( \frac{GM}{r_i^3} + \lambda \times {\bf v}_i\right)\right],$$ that requires $$\lambda\cdot{\bf r}_i = 0, \qquad {\bf v}_i = \lambda \times {\bf r}_i, \qquad \lambda^2 = \frac{GM}{r_i^3},$$ that means that all orbits are coplanar and circular. Is this true in general? That's the principle. Note, however, that all the planetary systems do not always stay in an orbital plane. Such systems can be explained by Lidov-Kozai oscillations, typically trigger by "high-excentricity migration" of hot Jupiters (Fabrycky, 2012). As far as we know now, we can say that: 

There are several clues. The Milky Way is a flat disk The first one, and the simplest one, is that we live in a disk. As you can see on images like the ones from the 2MASS survey in the infrared range: 

Turbulence sources: There are numerous sources of turbulence in the interstellar medium, at all scales: 

Well, if you want to become a professional astronomer, there is no obvious answer, since education systems can be quite different depending on your country. But astronomy & astrophysics is physics in the end, so a good training and strong knownledge in physics are definitely required (that involves math for sure). And in countries/universities where you can find an astronomy-oriented degree (at master level most of the time, before that it does not really make sense), you won't be surprised that most of the lectures are actually just physics or math. Then, to get a PhD in the field is the way to go. As for the positions, you can find some statistics in this paper released by ESO (the European Southern Observatory) for jobs in astronomy in the 2009/2010 hiring season. Bottom line is there were 65 opened positions worldwilde, that cannot be consider as "a lot". 

The common explanation is linked to the eye structure: in the center of the eye, you have mostly cones, that are used to detect colors and that are efficient only in bright light (that's why we don't see colors so well during the night). The rest of the eye contains more rods, that are used to detect dim light and contrast. So the best way to observe some faint objects in the sky is to use averted vision, which uses peripherical vision and therefore takes profit of your rods more than your cones. That is exactly the same thing when you look at any nebula. 

Black lines represent the magnetic field lines. They are tied to the surface of the Sun (the foot points). One of the magnetic field lines is looping, and it is "crossing itself". When it reconnects, it forms, on the top, a magnetic loop and, on the bottom, an magnetic arch. As pointed out by this diagram, magnetic reconnection mechanism is also associated to Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), since the energy released by magnetic reconnection is powerful enough to eject a significant amount of matter.

Origin of the magnetic seed fields Where do we start? That is no easy question, with a diversity of answers. One of the most standard ones is the Biermann battery you mentioned (one significant problem with Biermann batteries is the timescale needed to amplify such small fields; see below) in the early Universe. Another one is that the magnetic field can be generated at small scales by first generations of AGN and supernovæ and then distributed at larger scales (dynamo can help but distribution at larger scale can still be an issue; see below). Lastly, you can have some exotic processes to generate seed fields in the first instants after the Big Bang, typically linked to inflation processes and such. Magnetic field amplification If there is an initial magnetic field — which is not so easy to demonstrate — there are few mechanisms that could amplify magnetic fields efficently enough to explain the observed magnetic field. The most standard one is the $\alpha-\omega$ dynamo, combining a twist of the magnetic field lines in a differentially rotating disk with turbulent motions in the ISM that allows a regeneration of the magnetic fields (supernovæ explosions, stellar winds and other instabilities could do the work). Another possible mechanism is the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), that can easily generate a significant, large-scale field from almost any given seed field. There are other candidates such as Parker instability, or other flavors of dynamos. A central question then is of timescale: if these mechanisms can generate magnetic fields, the needed timescale to amplify a seed field to the current value may be far larger than the age of the Universe. Distribution Magnetic field is everywhere, not only in the ISM and at larger scale in galaxies, but also in galaxy clusters, in the IGM and so on. If the origin of the magnetic seed fields is of cosmic origin (exotic processes in the early Universe), you can explain the observed distribution; if not, things get tricky again. Turbulence, galaxy collisions and mergers may be of help, but the question is still largely open. 

The favored theory is a giant impact, at the end of the final stage of planetary formation (Canup, 2005). A "giant impact" is a collision with an object of a comparable size of the planet. That is also the most probable scenario for lunar formation (Canup, 2004).
