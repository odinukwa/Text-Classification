Assuming (2), let $J$ denote the kernel of $\pi$. Then $A$ is (*-isomorphic to) the quotient $A^{**}/J$. However, a quotient of a von Neumann algebra by a closed, two-sided ideal need not be a von Neumann algebra. (For example, the Calkin algebra is such a quotient and not a von Neumann algebra.) In the commutative case, we might also consider the following more general question: 

Let $A$ be a C*-algebra. We identify $A$ with its canonical image in the bidual $A^{**}$. Consider the following conditions: (1) $A$ is a von Neumann algebra. (2) There is a multiplicative conditional expectation from $A^{**}$ onto $A$, that is, a map $\pi\colon A^{**}\to A$ that is a *-homomorphism and such that $\pi(a)=a$ for all $a\in A$. Then (1) implies (2): Consider the predual $A_*$ of $A$, and the canonical embedding $\kappa\colon A_*\to (A_*)^{**}$. Then the dual of $\kappa$ has the desired properties. Note that $A^{**}$ is always a von Neumann algebra. One can show that (2) implies that $A$ is a monotone complete AW*-algebra. However, is it also a von Neumann algebra? 

Let $X$ be a Banach space, and let $F(X)$ be the finite-rank operators on $X$. Then $X$ has the $\lambda$-BAP if there exists a net $(S_i)_i$ in $F(X)$ with $\sup_i\|S_i\|\leq\lambda$ such that $S_i\to\mathrm{id}_X$ pointwise, that is, $\|S_i(x)-x\|\to 0$ for every $x\in X$. What is the connection to the following variants of this property: (Explanation of terminology below.) (1) There exists a net $(S_i)_i$ in $F(X)$ with $\sup_i\|S_i\|\leq\lambda$ such that $S_i\to\mathrm{id}_X$ in point-weak-topology, that is, $S_i(x)$ converges weakly to $x$ for every $x\in X$. (2) There exists a net $(S_i)_i$ in $F(X)$ with $\sup_i\|S_i\|\leq\lambda$ such that $S_i\to\mathrm{id}_X$ in the weak*-topology of $B(X)\subset B(X,X^{**})$. (2') There exists a net $(S_i)_i$ in $F(X,X^{**})$ with $\sup_i\|S_i\|\leq\lambda$ such that $S_i\to\mathrm{id}_X$ in the weak*-topology of $B(X,X^{**})$. (3) For every $S$ in the unit ball of $B(X,X^{**})$, there exists a net $(S_i)_i$ in $B(X)$ with $\sup_i\|S_i\|\leq\lambda$ such that $S_i\to S$ weak*. We have $\lambda$-BAP $\Rightarrow$ (1) $\Rightarrow$ (2) $\Rightarrow$ (2') $\Rightarrow$ (3). 

These are exactly the spaces which are countable unions of dyadic spaces. By definition, a dyadic space is the continuous quotient of the Cantor set. (This class includes all compact, metrizable spaces.) Let $C\subset [0,1]$ denote the Cantor set, and for $k\in\mathbb{Z}$ let $C+k\subset[k,k+1]$ denote the shifted Cantor set as a subset of $\mathbb{R}$. If $X$ is the union of dyadic spaces $X_1$, $X_2$, ..., then $X$ is a continuous image of the space $\bigcup_k (C+2k)$, which is a closed subset of $\mathbb{R}$. Conversely, assume $X$ is a quotient of a closed subset $Y\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. Then $Y$ is a countable union of compact subsets $Y_1$, $Y_2$, ... of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Since each $Y_k$ is compact and metrizable, its image in $X$ is dyadic. This also shows that one obtains the same class by considering just quotients of closed subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. 

The motivation for this question is to define derived functors in the category Mon. Just to avoid some misunderstanding: I am not interested in homological algebra over the field with one element. I am aware of some other questions that have been asked about homological algebra of commuative monoids, such as: Homological Algebra for Commutative Monoids? Structure Theorem for finitely generated commutative cancellative monoids? 

If $K$ is compact, extremally disconnected and infinite, then for every compact subset $D\subseteq\mathbf{C}$ there exists $a\in C(K)$ with spectrum $\sigma(a)=D$. [edit: Previously, $K$ was only assumed totally disconnected. As pointed out by Eric Wofsey, this is not enough.] Proof: Choose a sequence $(x_k)_k$ in $D$ such that $\{x_k:k\geq 1\}$ is dense in $D$. Using that $K$ is totally disconnected and infinite, choose pairwise disjoint, closed and open subsets $A_k\subseteq K$ with $K=\bigcup_{k=1}^\infty A_k$. Let $a\colon K\to\mathbf{C}$ be the function that takes value $x_k$ on $A_k$, for each $k$. One checks that $a$ belongs to $C(K)$. The spectrum of $a$ contains each $x_k$. Since the spectrum is closed, it contains $D$. One checks that the spectrum of $a$ is also contained in $D$. It follows that $\sigma(a)=D$. 

Contrary to what you said, the building block of an AI-algebra, namely $C([0,1],M_n)$, can naturally be embedded into the building block of an AT-algebra, namely $C(\mathbb{T},M_n)$, and not conversely. Indeed let $\pi\colon\mathbb{T}\to[0,1]$ be a surjective, continuous map (e.g., identifying the north and south halfcircles). Then the map $$ C([0,1],M_n)\to C(\mathbb{T},M_n),\quad f\mapsto f\circ\pi $$ is an injective ${}^*$-homomorphism. 

Let $X$ be a Banach space. Consider the map $$ \alpha\colon X\hat{\otimes} X^* \to B(X)^*, $$ defined one simple tensors as $$ \alpha(\xi\otimes\eta)(a) = \eta(a(\xi)).\quad (\xi\in X, \eta\in X^*, a\in B(X)) $$ Put differently, we consider the pairing between $X\hat{\otimes} X^*$ (the projective tensor product of $X$ and its dual space $X^*$) and $B(X)$ (the algebra of bounded linear operators on $X$) induced by $$ \langle \xi\otimes\eta, a\rangle = \langle a(\xi), \eta \rangle. $$ 

Let $G$ be a locally compact group, let $N$ be a closed normal subgroup of $G$, and let $\sigma\colon G/N\to G$ be a cross section. Let us define $\alpha\colon G/N\times G/N \to N$ by the formula $$ \sigma(x)\sigma(y)\alpha(x,y)=\sigma(xy), $$ for all $x,y\in G/N$. Then $\alpha$ records how far $\sigma$ is from being multiplicative. Is there a standard name for $\alpha$? It seems to be a variant of a $2$-cocycle, but it is not the usual $2$-cocylce associated to a cross section. 

Let $G$ be a locally compact group, and let $N$ be a closed, normal subgroup, and let $\pi\colon G\to G/N$ be the quotient homomorphism. It is known that there exists a Borel cross section, i.e., a measurable map $\sigma\colon G/N\to G$ such that $\pi\circ\sigma=\mathrm{id}_{G/N}$. Moreover, the Borel cross section can be chosen locally bounded, i.e., for every compact subset $K\subset G/N$, the set $\sigma(K)$ has compact closure in $G$. Consider the $2$-cocycle $\omega\colon G\times G/N \to N$ defined by the equality $$ \sigma(gx)\omega(g,x)=g\sigma(x) $$ for all $g\in G$ and $x\in G/N$. 

Also, I would be interested to know if these properties (in case they are not equivalent to the BAP) have been considered in the literature before. I think (2) $\Leftarrow$ (2') should be a direct consequence of the "Principle of local reflexivity". I also suspect that one could try to show $\lambda$-BAP $\Leftarrow$ (1) by passing to convex combinations of operators $S_i$ satisfying (1). Note that (2) can be rephrases as: "The subspace $F(X)\subset B(X,X^{**})$ is $\lambda$-norming.", and similarly for (2') and (3). Note that every reflexive space satisfies (3), but not all reflexive spaces have the $\lambda$-BAP. Terminology: We let $B(X,Y)$ denote the space of bounded linear operators from $X$ to $Y$. We give $B(X,X^{**})$ the natural weak*-topology coming from the identification $B(X,X^{**})=(X\hat{\otimes}X^*)^*$. The natural embedding of $B(X)$ in $B(X,X^{**})$ sends an operator $a\colon X\to X$ to the operator $\kappa_X\circ a\colon X\to X^{**}$, where $\kappa_X\colon X\to X^{**}$ is the embedding of $X$ into its bidual. A subspace $M$ of $X^*$ is $\lambda$-norming if $\|x\|\leq\lambda\sup\{|f(x)| : f\in M, \|f\|\leq 1\}$ for every $x\in X$, which is equivalent to the condition that the unit ball of $X^*$ is contained in the weak*-closure of the ball of radius $\lambda$ in $M$. The usual definition of the $\lambda$-Bounded Approximation Property ($\lambda$-BAP) is: There exists a net $(S_i)_i$ in $F(X)$ with $\sup_i\|S_i\|\leq\lambda$ and such that $S_i\to\mathrm{id}_X$ uniformly on compact subsets, that is, for every compact subset $K\subset X$ and $\varepsilon>0$, there exists $i$ such that $\|S_i(x)-x\|<\varepsilon$ for all $x\in K$. This is equivalent to the above e.g. by Proposition 4.3, p.73, in Ryan: "Introduction to Tensor Products of Banach Spaces".
