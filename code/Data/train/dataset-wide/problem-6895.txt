In effect, the desired real interest rate $R_t$ is chosen by the government (via changes in the nominal interest rate). But it is chosen based in the Taylor rule. The "standard" IS-MP-PC model (as in Jones's Macroeconomics textbook), is as follows: IS: $$\tilde{Y}_t = \bar{a} - \bar{b}\left(R_t - \bar{r}\right)$$ PC: $$\Delta \pi_t = \bar{v}\tilde{Y}_t + \bar{o}$$ MP (Taylor rule): $$R_t = \bar{r} + \bar{m}(\pi_t - \bar{\pi})$$ In the latter equation, the central bank/government choses $R_t$ according to deviations in inflation from the target. As inflation increases, the real interest rate increases. Now, according to the Phillips Curve, inflation responds positively to demand shocks ($\tilde{Y}_t$). In consequence, the real interest rate responds positively to $\tilde{Y}_t$. This is why, in the IS-MP diagram (with axis $R_t$ and $\tilde{Y}_t$), the MP has a positive slope. 

The key question to ask here is this: is the data missing a random selection of the population/sample? If this is the case (a situation called Missing Completely At Random, MCAR, you can simply discard the observations with missing values and run your model on the balanced panel. Conversely, if that is not the case (Missing Not At Random, MNAR), an estimation from the balanced panel will be biased. There is also an intermediate case, Missing At Random (MAR), which depends on distinguishing between missing based on observables (in which case you can do simple imputation), or missing on unobservables, in which case you need to perform a two-step Heckman estimation. Read more about missing data here, and in this very approachable book. There are plenty of tests that you can do to evaluate the nature of missing data. See here. These slides show a hands-on example of how to deal with unbalanced panel datasets. A very useful introduction to Unbalanced Panal Data is here, based on the textbook on Panel Data by B. Baltagi. 

In Chile, most of prices are measured in the local currency, the peso (currency code CLP). However, there are two other units of account. These are the UF and the UTM. These keep track of the real value of the currency, and are updated daily based on past inflation. For instance, the 16th of March of 2009, the UF was equivalent to CLP$21,000.46, whereas today (10th of July of 2017), its value is CLP\$26,666.19. The difference reflects the effect of inflation between the two dates. It serves several purposes. For example, it eases the denomination of assets paying real interest rates (e.g. UF + 2%); it is the standard used to price real estate; and it is the denomination of several state fines and minor taxes (e.g. parking fines). (It can also lead to hysteresis in inflation, when used to price wages). Is there any other country using such inflation-adjusted units of account? Or perhaps a country that used it in the past? I have never seen or read anything about this. I want to know more about the inspiration and usages of such monetary tools. 

$$ \hat{S}_{t+h|t} = F^h_t \quad h>0$$ where $F^h_t$ is the future forecast in the market. There are plenty of sources available online (e.g. here or here). 

They now provide values in dollars for several metrics related to median home value. For example, a graph using the data at the state level: $\hspace{3cm}$ (code for figure here) 

It is well documented that women in now developed countries entered the labour market all thoughout the 20th century. As such, female labour participation have consistently increased. For example, this is a table from Godin (1977): 

The formula for OM is: $$ OM = 1 - \frac{1}{TFP\times PCR}$$ In the baseline year, you have that Operative Margin (OM) = 0.247. Further, by assumption, price change ratio (PCR) = 1. Then: $$TFP = \frac{1}{1-OM} = \frac{1}{1-0.247}=1.328$$ Then, you are told that the TFP changed by 2.6%. Therefore, the new value for TFP is 1.3625 (equivalent to 1.328 $\times$ 1.026). With this new TFP, and assuming that PCR = 1, you can find the new value for OM: $$ OM = 1 - \frac{1}{1.3625\times 1}$$ $$ OM = 1 - 0.734$$ $$ OM = 0.266$$ There you get the 26.6% result. 

The first bold statement refers to the one dimensionality of the unobserved type, whereas the second refers to it being a numerical variable, which means $\Theta$ is an ordered set. Conversely, a non-ordered set contains elements which have no intrinsic order. For instance, you can think of a case where agents do not know the city where they are to be located. The set "cities" is unordered because cities do not necessarily hold a particular order in a one-dimension set. You can add a second dimension (e.g. population), where you could order them based on city size. I would say that having ordered sets facilitates algebraic analysis, since it enables the introduction of monotonic strategies, whereby an important outcome variable is a monotonic function of the agent's type. In effect, this seems to be important in the paper, when the author states that: 

The emphasis above wants to highlight an important question, which I think it is pertinent to economics. Namely, if the direction of time were to be reversed, would the theoretical statements described by these models still hold? This is, are dynamic economic models time-asymmetrical or time-symmetrical? For example, consider a Solow model. Is there an arrow of time in this model? To put it differently, draw a Solow diagram of the accumulation of capital. Draw the path of the economy from A to B. Does this imply necessarily a unidirectional time evolution? This relates to the issue of irreversibility and determinism. If we use deterministic models (as the standard Solow), we can reconstruct "back" everything from "the future". However, complex systems, where uncertainty and stochastic shocks prevails are by definition irreversible. As this article on the Chemistry Nobel prize winner Ilya Prigogine states: 

The marginal profit you calculate is correct. We can rearrange the solution of the problem you are given. This is equivalent to $$ \frac{dP}{dq} = 192 -176q + 48q^2 -4q^3$$ This derivative has as primitive function the following profit function: $$P(q) = c + 192q -88q^2 + 16q^3 - q^4$$ where $c$ is a constant (e.g. $c=0$). This is clearly different from the original profit function in your problem. In consequence, either the profit function or the solution is wrong. 

Check the documentation for more details. Many researchers have also used the Amadeus database, also for Europe. A nice summary about it is here. For the US, take a look at this paper. The authors use three different sources of markups: Compustat, NBER Census of Manufacturing, and IRS (Inland Revenue Service). The first two are micro-data whereas the latter is aggregate at industry level. 

In this article, sociologist Erik Olin Wright provides a definition of capitalism (from a socialist tradition): 

The plan did involve loans but was mostly in the form of grants (gifts). As the Wikipedia entry states: 

The notes by Acemoglu are quite useful too. There are whole sections on Labor Economics, but also a lot of scattered material throughout the rest of the topics, particularly related with technological change and growth. That is particularly relevant with the Macro-Labour component of your question. To single out one relevant topic which is not in the references in other answers, consider these notes on "Labor coercion" (slavery, serfdom). 

The Socialist candidate for the upcoming presidential elections Benoit Hamon says he wants to roll out the Universal Basic Income in France, to be paid by "taxing the wealth created by robots" (for example, news here). How do you tax the wealth created by robots? What is so special about this policy? Is it not just a higher tax on capital? (The answer I am looking for is like someone providing a briefing to Hamon on how to implement this policy. I am expecting concrete ideas. Some analysis of why the implementation would work or not are valuable.) 

You are not very clear on whether your model is uniequational or a system of equations (e.g. a VAR). I will assume the former is your case. There are several approaches to estimating Real GDP. One approach is via estimating a production function (i.e. a supply side approach). Here, you need information on factors of production, like hours worked, education level, physical capital, etc. It would make little sense to use inflation as a regressor in this approach. An alternative method is to focus on the demand side, by which you are interested in explaining the determinants of GDP sub-components like consumption, government spending, etc. This approach is in my opinion the most common among specialised institutions like central banks and etc. For example, Atlanta Fed, OECD, NIESR UK, researchers at the Bank of Canada. The latter type of models are normally very complex, and go beyond the one equation system. As such, some of them do include inflation as one of the variables (both as independent and dependent variable), because inflation is expected to affect real wages and thereby consumption (for example, see the documentation of the Atlanta Fed model here. Now, if you only have one equation, and are using the demand side approach, I would include inflation as long as other included variables are also nominal (like retail sales). Alternatively, you can redefine every variable as real, and not include inflation. This is a more restrictive scenario though, as you are imposing extra restrictions (which, in fact, you can test). 

In macro, the standard approach to forecast variables which are intrinsically nominal like GDP seems to be to separate the forecast. This is, you want to have a model for real GDP and for inflation. The final forecast for nominal GDP is the "combination" of both. This is for instance the standard practice of the Fed (of Atlanta) and the Bank of England (pages 39 to 41). In your case of a financial variable, you could model the real (deflated) variable, and then, as inflation is given by the economy, just take the official inflation forecast of your country from the central bank. They are the real experts on this so is a safe thing to do in my opinion. Also, the market expectations of inflation, crucial in finance, are very much informed by central bank estimates. This approach gives you a cleaner estimation of your model too. As you say, your determinant is a rate, and thus inflation is just molesting in the left hand side.
