I think the answer is no. Consider the case where $X$ is the two coordinate axes in $\mathbb{A}^2$ (corresponding to the ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]/(xy)$) and $f$ is the projection onto the first axis (corresponding to $\mathbb{C}[x] \to \mathbb{C}[x,y]/(xy)$). Then the fibers of this map are a point, except over zero where the fiber is an $\mathbb{A}^1.$ I realize that this map is not proper, but I'm sure you could modify this example so that the map is proper. 

I would highly recommend chapter 3 from Chriss and Ginzburg's textbook "Representation Theory and Complex Geometry" (really, the entire book is worthy of recommendation). In a very similar vein, I would also recommend Ginzburg's article "Geometric methods in the representation theory of Hecke algebras and quantum groups", which can be found on the arxiv at: $URL$ In some ways, I actually prefer these notes to the aforementioned textbook. While I'm not quite as familiar with it, the textbook "Nilpotent orbits, primitive ideals, and characteristic classes" by Borho, Brylinski, and MacPherson is a very nice reference. In my opinion, however, it serves as more of a secondary reference if you're just interested in the basics of the Springer resolution. This article and two textbooks, together with the abundant references found within, should be more than enough to get you started. There are, of course, numerous papers on the subject. In particular, I would recommend the 1983 paper by Borho and MacPherson. 

i)-ii) If the subgroup isn't closed, there's no reason in general for the quotient space to even be an algebraic variety. So for the definition to even make sense, there has to be some guarantee that $G/P$ is a variety. A standard result says that if $H \subset G$ is a closed subgroup of a linear algebraic group, then the quotient $G/H$ is a quasi-projective variety. You can find these results, for example, in Borel's text on linear algebraic groups. I don't know of an example of a non-closed subgroups whose quotient both exists and is not complete. (iii) Pretty much by definition, $G/P$ is what's known as a partial flag variety. For the classical groups, you can directly verify that you get flag-like objects in this way, and for more general groups this is taken as the definition. However, if by flag variety you mean the full flag variety, then just pick any parabolic subgroup which is not a Borel subgroup. The simplest example occurs for $G = GL_3$ where you have parabolic subgroups corresponding the variety of lines in $\mathbb{C}^3$ (i.e., $\mathbb{P}^2$) and its dual, the variety of planes in $\mathbb{C}^3.$ (iv) I'm not sure exactly what you're asking for here. Just examples of varieties that aren't quotients of linear algebraic groups? 

This question is heavily related to one of my favorite relations between geometry and representation theory. Consider simple Lie algebras of the following types: 

Let $Y$ denote the disjoint union of the coordinate hyperplanes in $\mathbb{C}^n,$ and let $f:Y \to X$ denote the corresponding resolution of singularities. 1) Show that $f_{\ast}\mathbb{C}_Y[n-1] \simeq IC_X$ (consider, for example, the support conditions and the fact that both sheaves are isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}_U[n-1]$ when restricted to the nonsingular open $U \subset X$). Edit (some details added): Letting $U$ denote the complement of the set where any two coordinate planes intersect, $f$ is an isomorphism when restricted to $U.$ We therefore have that the restriction (i.e., pullback) of $f_{\ast}\mathbb{C}_Y[n-1]$ to $U$ coincides with $\mathbb{C}_U[n-1]$ (by proper base change if you like). In order to conclude that $f_{\ast}\mathbb{C}_Y[n-1] \simeq IC_X,$ we now just need to check the support and cosupport conditions which uniquely define the intersection cohomology sheaf (together with the fact that its restriction to $U$ is the (shifted) constant sheaf). These conditions are similar to, but more restrictive than, the support and cosupport conditions for perverse sheaves. I recommend looking at page 21 of the wonderful article by de Cataldo and Migliorini, which can be found at $URL$ for a statement of these support and cosupport conditions (and figure 1 on page 25 for a visual illustration of the definition). Since the fibers of $f$ consist of a finite number of points, the cohomology of the fibers is non-zero only in degree zero. This shows that the first condition (the support condition) is satisfied. For the second condition (the cosupport condition), you can either derive it from the support condition using Verdier duality and the properness of $f,$ or you can simply note that an open ball in $\mathbb{C}^{n-1}$ has non-zero compactly supported cohomology only in degree $2n-2.$ 2) Now it's straightforward to compute any of the stalks since the fiber of $x \in X$ consists of anywhere between one point and n points, depending on how many hyperplanes $x$ lives inside of. Alternatively, it is also possible to do this by using only basic definitions. To compute the stalk at $x,$ intersect a sufficiently small open ball around $x$ in $\mathbb{C}^n$ with $X$ and then calculate the intersection cohomology by considering intersection cochains (just like you would for singular cohomology, but now with a less restrictive notion of cochain). 

I'm not sure what the purpose of the assumption on the ranks of$E$ and $G$ is (by the way, how are you defining rank? Are you making some assumptions about the sheaves, and is $S$ smooth?). I guess it's so that you can make your assumption about the double dual of $H$. As YBL mentioned, there is always an isomorphism $det(G) \simeq det(E) \otimes det(H)$ whenever you have a short exact sequence. I'm assuming that your map $0 \to det(E) \to det(G)$ is, under this isomorphism, equivalent to picking out a section of $det(H).$ It is then clear that the cokernel of your map will end up being the same as the cokernel of the map $0 \to \mathcal{O}_S \to det(H).$ This will be true in general, without any of the extra assumptions you've made. In your particular case, if $det(H) \simeq \mathcal{O}_S(D),$ then this cokernel will be the skyscraper sheaf supported at $D$. Maybe I'm being stupid, but does the assumption on the double dual of $H$ imply this about the determinant? 

Background Let $X$ denote a smooth projective curve over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $G$ denote a semi-simple simply connected algebraic group over $\mathbb{C},$ which has associated flag variety $G/B.$ Then we can consider the variety $Maps^d(X, G/B)$ of maps from $X$ to $G/B$ of fixed degree $d$ where $d$ is an $\mathbb{N}$-linear combination of coroots of $G.$ See the top of page 2 of this paper by Alexander Kuznetsov Kuznetsov for the definition of degree. The Plucker embedding of the flag variety into projective space gives an alternative formulation of $Maps^d(X, G/B)$ which can be found in section 1.2 of Kuznetsov or in this survey article of Alexander Braverman Braverman. In general, $Maps^d(X, G/B)$ is not compact, but there is a compactification due to Drinfeld, which is referred to as the variety of quasi-maps and denoted $QMaps^d(X, G/B).$ See Kuznetsov or Braverman. On the other hand, when $G = SL_n,$ there is a second compactfication due to Laumon. This is because when $G = SL_n,$ we have both the Plucker embedding description of the flag variety, but also the description of the flag variety as flags of vector spaces. This latter description gives another formulation of $Maps^d(X, G/B)$ but leads to a compactification known as quasi-flags. Once again, see Kuznetsov. When $n>2,$ varieties of quasi-maps and of quasi-flags are different. It turns out that quasi-flags are always smooth, while quasi-maps have singularities. Broadening our focus somewhat, we could instead consider the representable map of stacks $Bun_B(X) \to Bun_G(X),$ and note that the fiber over the trivial $G$-bundle is the union of all the $Maps^d(X, G/B)$ for all possible degrees (note that the degree just tells us which connected component of $Bun_B$ we live in). Just as the variety of maps above was not compact, the map $Bun_B \to Bun_G$ is not proper. But there exists a relative compactification of $Bun_B,$ also referred to as the Drinfeld compactification, which I will denote $Bun_B^D.$ This compactification still maps to $Bun_G,$ but the map is now proper. The fiber over the trivial bundle of this map coincides with the union of all $QMaps^d(X, G/B).$ As before, when $G = SL_n,$ there is a second compactification of $Bun_B$ which I will denote $Bun_B^L$ whose fiber over the trivial bundle coincides with the union of all the quasi-flags varieties. See this paper by Braverman and Gaitsgory BG or this follow-up paper by Braverman, Gaitsgorgy, Finkelberg, and Mirkovic BGFK for more details. Question In Kuznetsov, Kuznetsov proves that when $X = \mathbb{P}^1$ and $G = SL_n,$ there is a map from the space of quasi-flags of degree $d$ to the space of quasi-maps of degree $d$ which is a small resolution of singularities. Later, in BG, it is asserted that Kuznetsov proved that $Bun_B^L(X)$ is a small resolution of singularities of $Bun_B^D(X)$ for any smooth projective curve $X.$ It seems to me that there are two discrepancies here. One has to do with an arbitrary smooth projective curve versus $\mathbb{P}^1.$ The second has to do with moving from the varieties of quasi-maps and quasi-flags to the stacks $Bun_B^D$ and $Bun_B^L.$ Does anyone know a reference which explains the bridge between Kuznetsov and the assertions of BG? Or perhaps this was just something clear to the experts which never warranted an explanation?
