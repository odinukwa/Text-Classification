Here I ask a somewhat curious question on Euler's totient function $\varphi$. QUESTION: Can we write each integer $n>8$ as $k+m$ with $k$ and $m$ distinct positive integers such that $\varphi(k)\varphi(m)$ is a square? Based on my computation, in 2014 I conjectured that the answer is yes. For example, \begin{align*}17&=5+12\ \ \text{with}\ \varphi(5)\varphi(12)=4\times4=4^2, \\24&=4+20\ \ \text{with}\ \ \varphi(4)\varphi(20)=2\times8=4^2, \\56&=8+48\ \ \text{with}\ \ \varphi(8)\varphi(48)=4\times16=8^2. \end{align*} Though the graph available from $URL$ reflecting the growth of $$\text{A236998}(n)=\left|\left\{0<k<\frac n2:\ \varphi(k)\varphi(n-k)\ \text{is a square}\right\}\right|$$ supports my conjecture, I feel rather puzzled since I do not see why the conjecture is reasonable. By the way, in 2013 I conjectured that any integer $n>5$ can be written as the sum of two positive integers $k$ and $m$ such that $(\varphi(k)+\varphi(m))/2$ is prime (cf. $URL$ This is still open. Any comments are welcome! 

Is any integer $n>1$ the sum of a number of the form $4^k-k$ $(k=0,1,2\ldots$) and a positive squarefree number? Though such representations are very sparse, I conjecture that the answer is yes! For any positive integer $n$, let $a(n)$ be the number of nonnegative integers $k$ with $n-(4^k-k)$ positive and squarefree. The sequence $a(1),a(2),\ldots$ is available from $URL$ Note that $1\leqslant a(n)\leqslant 7$ for all $n=2,3,\ldots,10^5$. I have verified that $a(n)>0$ for every $n=2,3,\ldots,10^{10}$. It is natural to look at those integers $n>1$ with $a(n)=1$. I have found totally 112 such values below $2\times 10^9$ (cf. $URL$ the last of which is $180196927$ with $$180196927=4^{11}-11+2\times139\times227\times2789.$$ I guess that there are no other values of $n$ with $a(n)=1$. I have some other similar questions. For example, I conjecture that any positive integer can be written as the sum of a Fibonacci number and a positive odd squarefree number (cf. $URL$ Any comments are welcome! 

I like Jonah Ostroff short and sweet proof, but the key to it lies in the fact that there is not a bijection between the set $S_1$ of connected graphs and the set $S_2$ of disconnected graphs over $n$ labeled vertices for $n \ge 4$, as follows: 

I believe the only way to deduce the self-intersection or self-avoiding nature of a walk based on relative moves of {turn left, move forward, turn right} is to turn them into a sequence of absolute moves and simulate them on the square lattice. The reason for this is that the self-intersection may occur in two squares as the sequence (move forward), (turn left | turn right)${}^3$, (move forward). It may also occur $n$ steps later, with $n>1$, as in ( (move forward)${}^{10}$, (turn right) )${}^4$ which self intersects as a square of width $10$ after eighty relative moves $=$ forty absolute moves. If you were to look at a series of relative moves or turtle-graphics-moves as a series of symbols, and attempt to apply some symbolic dynamics rules such as replace a (forward)(turnaround)(forward) $\to$ (INTERSECTIONFOUND), or (turn right)${}^3 \to$ (turn around), etc., then it would not be possible to create enough rules to keep track of state of each possible lattice point in the square lattice. You have to keep track of the state of the lattice points as having been "visited" or "not visited" and simulate the entirety of the walk or at least enough of the walk until an intersection first occurs in order to determine that the walk is self-intersecting. 

What needs to exist is a system that's akin to this site's functionality that could be used on a personal or university server and allow multiple people to contribute (via password-protected entry to the web-site) together to a notebook page which contains $\LaTeX$ markup and does it in a clean fashion. Perhaps the newer incarnation or instantiation of MO being tested on alpha.mathoverflow.net would allow for something like "private question pages" which are invitation only and could be used as an adjunct for white-board like functionality while the participants also use a telephone or skype or any other tools for instant collaboration. This technique would also allow for asynchronous updating by the collaborators if they happen to be living/working in different time zones. 

Recall that the Mersenne numbers are those integers $M_p=2^p-1$ with $p$ prime. QUESTION: Is it true that for each prime $p>3$ there is a Mersenne number which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $p$? In 2014 I conjectured further that for any prime $p>3$ there is a prime $q<p/2$ such that $M_q=2^q-1$ is a primitive root modulo $p$ (cf. $URL$ or $URL$ For example, $M_{17}=131071$ is a primitive root modulo the prime $37$. Of course, the question is easier than this difficult conjecture. I'm even unable to prove that each prime $p>3$ has a quadratic nonresidue of the form $2^n-1$ with $n$ a positive integer. Any ideas towards the proof? By the way, in 2014 I also conjectured that for each prime $p>3$ there is a Fibonacci number smaller than $p/2$ which is a quadratic nonresidue modulo $p$ (cf. $URL$ This should be quite challenging. Any comments are welcome! 

Let $\mathbb Z^+$ denote the set of positive integers. Here I ask the following question. QUESTION: Does each integer have the form $x^4-y^3+z^2$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$? I guess that the answer is affirmative. I have verified that any integer $m$ with $|m|\leqslant 10^5$ can be written as $x^4-y^3+z^2$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$ (cf. $URL$ For example, \begin{gather*}0=4^4-8^3+16^2,\ \ -1=1^4-3^3+5^2,\\-20=32^4-238^3+3526^2,\ \ 11019=4325^4-71383^3+3719409^2.\end{gather*} Moreover, based on some heuristic arguments, I conjecture that if $\{a,b,c\}$ is among the multisets $$\{2,3,3\},\ \{2,3,4\},\ \{2,3,5\},$$ then any integer $m$ can be written as $x^a+y^b-z^c$ with $x,y,z\in\mathbb Z^+$ in infinitely many ways. See Conjecture 5.1 and Remark 5.1 of my paper New conjectures on representations of integers (I). I don't know how to prove that the question has a positive answer. Any comments on the question are welcome! 

Are you talking about fixed biases? If the bias is not a fixed value like the matrices in $n$-dimensions I described above, you could have the probabilities be a function of their location in the $\mathbb{Z}^n$ lattice or a function of the current positions distance from the origin. In that case, you end-up simulating physical scenarios, such as the motion of a charged particle in an electric field, or gravitational attraction. If you used an inverse-square (to the distance) law, simulating gravity, you'd end up with a lunar-crrash-lander or a satellite-orbiting type of simulation. Are you talking about fixed biases? (original answer below, valid for a fixed unbiased, or for a fixed-value biased random walker, where the bias is not a function of the random walker's position) 

If you've got a Macintosh with OS X, or System 9, you can use the built in Graphing Calculator program NuCalc to directly type in the equation, zoom in and out, and fly around the 3-d surface plot; Graphing Calculator can also do inequalitiies such as $x^2+y^2 \gt 5$. 

I know quite a few people who received their first Ph.D. after the age of 30, and some who received their M.D. after the age of 40. Their success hinged on their desire to do the work that comprised their Ph.D. research, or their desire to become medical doctors and perform clinical medical duties. It's not your age that matters as much as your motivation and intention does. However, note that a theoretical Computer Science degree and a Mathematics degree are very different beasts, even if at the base of both lie the same thing in the theory of automata. And don't even think of lumping Statistics and Mathematics in the same pool -- :) -- without expecting to get some raised eyebrows and arguments. Do you notice that statistical questions on this web site get told to ask the question over at a different website? You probably need to find your focus first. What do you really want to do: computer science, mathematics, or statistics? Then figure out where you can go to further your specific interests and work with someone else who works in that domain. What questions are burning in your head? What do you want to figure out and understand better? What is it that you can figure out which no one else could probably do, due to the unique confluence of talents and skills and interests which you possess? 

I'm trying to understand the proof of the Beilinson-Bernstein localisation theorem at the moment, but there's just one point where I'm having a mental block, and was wondering if anybody could clarify things for me. Specifically, it's this (not quite general) theorem which I'm trying to prove: Let $G$ be a semisimple algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$, $B$ a Borel subgroup and $X=G/B$ the flag variety. Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be the Lie algebra of $G$, $\mathfrak{b}$ the Lie algebra of $B$, $\mathfrak{h}$ the Cartan subalgebra contained in $\mathfrak{b}$, $\mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{h}\oplus\mathfrak{n}$ ($\mathfrak{n}$ nilpotent), $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{n}^-\oplus\mathfrak{h}\oplus\mathfrak{n}$ (you get the picture). Writing $U(\mathfrak{g})$ for the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$ we have $U(\mathfrak{g})=U(\mathfrak{h})\oplus(\mathfrak{n}^-U(\mathfrak{g})+U(\mathfrak{g})\mathfrak{n})$, by PBW. Let $\lambda:B\to \mathbb{C}^\times$ be a character, and let $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$ denote the $G$-equivariant invertible sheaf on $X$ with fiber $\mathbb{C}^{-\lambda}$ at $eG$. That is, $B$ acts on the trivial $\mathbb{C}^{-\lambda}$-bundle $G\times\mathbb{C}^{-\lambda}$ by $b(g,m)=(gb^{-1},(-\lambda)(b)m)=(gb^{-1},\lambda(b^{-1})m)$, and $B\backslash G\times(\mathbb{C}^{-\lambda})$ is a $G$-equivariant $\mathbb{C}^{-\lambda}$-bundle on $X$; $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$ is then its sheaf of sections. Since $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$ is $G$-equivariant we obtain a homomorphism $\alpha^\lambda:U(\mathfrak{g})\to\Gamma(X,\mathcal{D}_X^\lambda)$ where $\mathcal{D}_X^\lambda=\mathcal{L}^\lambda\otimes\mathcal{D}_X\otimes\mathcal{L}^{-\lambda}$ is the sheaf of differential operators on $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$. (tensor products taken over ${\mathcal{O}_X}$). Then, what I would like to prove is that the restriction of $\alpha_\lambda$ to the centre $Z(\mathfrak{g})$ of $U(\mathfrak{g})$ factors through the character $\chi_\lambda$ (i.e. the map $Z(\mathfrak{g})\to U(\mathfrak{h})$ coming from the direct sum decomposition above, composed with the map $\lambda:U(\mathfrak{h})=\operatorname{Sym}(\mathfrak{h})\to\mathbb{C}$). Of course, this isn't the whole theorem, but it's the only part I'm having trouble with. I believe I am correct in thinking that $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$ is nothing more than the pushforward from $G$ of a certain subsheaf of $\mathcal{O}_G$, namely the one whose sections $f$ are those satisfying $f(gb)=\lambda(b)f(g)$ for $g\in G,b\in B$. So it should be enough to show that $Z(\mathfrak{g})$ acts on that in the right way. (For some reason, I find the action of $\mathfrak{g}$ on $\mathcal{O}_G$ much easier to think about than its action on $\mathcal{L}^\lambda$.) But I am really stuck. I've looked in the book "D-modules, Perverse Sheaves and Representation Theory" by Hotta et al., where they seem to prove this on pages 278-279, but only found it confusing (and they gave the wrong definition of the Harish-Chandra homomorphism, which I found off-putting). I've also looked in Gaitsgory's notes ($URL$ where he seems to prove this (at least, the case $\lambda=0$) on pages 42-43, but that's also confusing. What's worse, is that apparently Gaitsgory's proof makes no use of the algebraic geometry of $\mathfrak{g}$, whereas Hotta et al. appear the Springer resolution of the nilpotent cone in an important way. If anyone could enlighten me at all about this, I would be extremely thankful! 

Those integers $\binom{2n}n\ (n=0,1,2,\ldots)$ are called central binomial coefficients. By Stirling's formula, $$\binom{2n}n\sim \frac{4^n}{\sqrt{n\pi}}\ \ \ \ (n\to+\infty).$$ Of course, the central binomial coefficients are much sparser than the squares of integers. Motivated by Lagrange's four-square theorem, here I ask the following question. QUESTION: Is every integer $n>1$ the sum of two squares and two central binomial coefficients? I conjecture that the answer is affirmative. I have verified this for $n$ up to $6\times10^9$; for example, $$2435=32^2+33^2+\binom{2\times4}4+\binom{2\times5}5.$$ For the number of ways to write a positive integer $n$ as $a^2+b^2+\binom{2c}c+\binom{2d}d$ with $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb N=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$, $a\leqslant b$ and $c\leqslant d$, one may consult $URL$ A set $A\subseteq \mathbb N$ is called an additive basis of order two if $\{a+b:\ a,b\in A\}=\mathbb N$. My above conjecture essentially says that $$\left\{k^2+\binom{2m}m-1:\ k,m=0,1,2,\ldots\right\}$$ is an additive basis of order two. I have some similar questions. I conjecture that each integer $n>1$ can be written as the sum of two squares and two Catalan numbers, and that $$\left\{a^2+b^2+\binom{2k+1}k+\binom{2m+1}m:\ a,b,k,m\in\mathbb N\right\}=\{2,3,\ldots\}.$$ See $URL$ and $URL$ for related data. My above question looks quite challenging. Any helpful ideas? 

Here I ask the following question in additive combinatorics. QUESTION: Let $A$ be any finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$ with $|A|=n>3$. Can we write $A$ as $\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ so that all the $n$ sums \begin{gather*}a_1+a_2+a_3,\ a_2+a_3+a_4,\ \ldots, \\ a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}+a_n,\ a_{n-1}+a_n+a_1,\ a_n+a_1+a_2\end{gather*} are pairwise distinct? Note that if $G=\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}$ is an addtive abelian group with $|G|=n>3$ then $2(a_1+\ldots+a_n)=0$ and hence \begin{align*}&(a_1+a_2+a_3)+\ldots+(a_{n-2}+a_{n-1}+a_n) \\&+(a_{n-1}+a_n+a_1)+(a_n+a_1+a_2) \\=&3(a_1+\ldots+a_n)=a_1+\ldots+a_n.\end{align*} This is the main motivation of my question. In 2013 I conjectured that the question always has a positive answer, and showed this when $G$ is torsion-free (cf. $URL$ However, I'm even unable to answer the question for $G=\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ with $p$ prime. Any comments are welcome! 

If you end up attempting to label the same vertex with both labels/colors, then the graph is not bipartite. Otherwise, you end up with every vertex labeled with the parity ($0$=even, $1$=odd) of their distance from the initial vertex chosen for this labeling. 

This is also similar to a different technique for generating the Sierpinski Triangle through an iterated method which neither converges nor diverges but chaotically stays in a particular set. 

Thus to model or simulate something which captures global properties in this case, it is important to allow the model to hold and represent the global property of "the path walked thus far". It's also akin to and contrary to the ant-walking algorithms with the ants leaving a pheremone trail which can increase the likelihood of further walkers following a particular path. It's also similar to creating a path for a painter to walk without being "painted into a corner". 

Thus for square, non-convex, and pretty much any noncircular fence, the level-set path one meter of the fence will not be $2 \pi \sim 6.28$ meters different from the level-set path of distance $0$ from the fence. The generalization, however, will still apply that the level set path of distance $x$ away from the fence will be smaller ($d_x \lt d_0$) if the robot follows the level set path within the fence, vs. larger if the robot follows the level set path outside the fence ($d_x \gt d_0$). 

I just noticed Joseph's comment in his question about Markov chains. My observations about the correctness of trying to use Markov chains to describe the rolling of a die, fair or unfair: If by state in the Markov chains, you mean just the "face" it is currently on or the "face" which is lower-most in attitude at a particular point in time, then it is inappropriate to use Markov chains because the likelihood of transitioning from die face $F_i$ to die face $F_j$ is not purely dependent upon the current state. If $F_j$ and $F_k$ are two "faces" adjacent to face $F_i$, then the likelihoods of transitioning $F_i \to F_j$ vs. $F_i \to F_k$ is not just dependent on the "current state" being $F_i$, but also dependent upon the velocity, position, and orientation of the die. The "faces" are necessary but not sufficient to encode state in such a way for Markov chains to be applicable: that the Bayesian requirement that "current state" at time $t$ is all that is needed to be known in order to be able to predict the likelihood of the state at time $t+1$ (if you talk about discrete time) or time $t+\varepsilon$ if you talk about continous time. If by "state", you try to get around this factor that only current state be considered and not the history of how you came to currently be in that state, then you could try to add the vectors of position, velocity, and orientation as extra "states", which is valid in numerical simulation, because ultimately all reals are still encoded into limited precision "floating point" representations of reals. However, the transition table would be huge if you allowed even for 16-bit floating point representation. I do not think that history-less "Markov chains" can be applied in this situation. older answer components below
