My bashful, nameless, colleague asked me: When you identify opposite faces of a square, then depending on where you twist or not, you get a torus, Klein bottle, or projective plane. 

I'm assuming that you meant "is it true... satisfies that". In which case the answer is yes, not just for $\mathfrak{sl}(3)$ but any semisimple Lie algebra. One of the many ways to see this uses the Littelmann path model, in which the highest weight paths in the tensor product crystal are (only some of the) concatenations of the highest weight path for $L(\alpha)$ and a path for $L(\beta)$. I don't view this as a research-level question. Also, please don't use $\alpha$ to denote a dominant weight, because everybody uses it for a simple root. 

Let $f:X\to Y$ be a dominant map of algebraic varieties. Say that $f$ generically admits sections if there exists a Zariski (not etale) open set $U \subseteq Y$ over which $f$ has a section $\sigma:Y\to X$. For example, $f:\mathbb C\to \mathbb C$ taking $z\mapsto z^2$ does not generically admit sections. 

I think it's because we have well-developed techniques with which to prove that this condition holds, and when those fail, people don't put that much effort into trying to describe the (more difficult) homotopy types. I'd be happy to hear that this is an unduly pessimistic view. 

Here's a place to see the normal cone side-by-side with other familiar constructions, that I learned from Fulton's "Intersection Theory". Here $X \subset Y$. Start with the space $Y \times {\mathbb P}^1$, thought of as a trivial family over ${\mathbb P}^1$. Blow up the subscheme $X \times \infty$. Now we still have a flat family over ${\mathbb P}^1$, in which all the fibers except the one over $\infty$ are still copies of $Y$. The fiber over $\infty$ is reducible: one piece $Z_1$ is the blowup of $Y$ along $X$, and the other is the projective completion $Z_2$ of the normal cone to $X$ inside $Y$. These intersect along the projectivization of the normal cone, which appears in $Z_1$ as the exceptional divisor, and in $Z_2$ as the stuff added in projective completion. (An example, for people who like polytopal pictures of toric varieties: let $Y$ be ${\mathbb P}^2$, pictured as a triangle, and $X$ be a point, pictured as a vertex. Then $Y \times {\mathbb P}^1$ is pictured as a triangular prism, and its blowup by cutting a corner off that prism. The fiber over $\infty$ is then pictured as cutting that triangle into a trapezoid $Z_1$ union a small triangle $Z_2$, glued along an interval, matching the decomposition above.) So, if perhaps you don't like degenerating $Y$ (which may be complete) to something noncomplete, you can complete it by including $Z_1$. The normal cone is $Z_2 \setminus Z_1$. Two other comments. On $Y \times {\mathbb P}^1$ there is a circle action, dilating the ${\mathbb P}^1$. It acts trivially on the $0$ and $\infty$ fibers, moving the rest around. When we blow up $X \times \infty$, the circle action on the new $\infty$ fiber $Z_1 \cup Z_2$ is nontrivial on $Z_2$; it is the dilation of the cone fibers. This is one place to lay blame for the existence of this "cone" structure. Finally, there's a conformally equivalent way to think about the $Y$ to $Z_1 \cup Z_2$ degeneration, at least when $X$ and $Y$ are smooth. Pick a small tubular neighborhood (nonalgebraic!) around $X$, with boundary $S$, a sphere bundle over $X$. Let the metric on $Y$ get very looong nearby $S$, in directions passing through $S$. You might say that $X$ is falling into a black hole, with $S$ the Schwarzschild boundary. In the limit, it gets infinitely long, and $X$ has bubbled off into its own universe. 

If $G$ is compact, then we can think about its cohomology with Lie algebra cohomology, so be doing some kind of representation theory. And of course the first nontrivial homology is determined by the the first nontrivial homotopy. (Since $G$ is smooth, we can relate its homology and cohomology, too.) Specifically, if $G$ is simply connected (and compact), then $H^1 = H^2 = 0$, and $\dim H^3 =$ the number of simple factors. The $H^2$ result, one interprets as the statement that $G$ has no nontrivial central extensions. The $H^3$ (or $\pi_3$) result one usually interprets as saying that $LG$ (free loops) does have nontrivial central extensions. 

I handed out pieces (the 0-triangles, 1-triangles, and rhombi) for the 3rd graders to assemble, in groups, telling them to make triangles. Then made a table with n = #edges on a side (any side, since they're equilateral), k = #1s on a side (theorem: any side), n-k, #1-triangles, #0-triangles, #rhombi. Different groups made different puzzles, and I included some little ones (n=0 and 1) in the table. Then asked if anyone saw patterns. I got the answers I wanted, which were that #1-triangles = $k^2$, #0-triangles = $(n-k)^2$, #rhombi = $k(n-k)$. It works nicely with younger children, too, but they're less likely to guess these formulae. 

$G = S_n$, $H = GL(k)$, $V = ({\mathbb C}^k)^{\otimes n}$. $G = H$, $V = Fun(G)$ (the Peter-Weyl theorem) $G = GL(m)$, $H = GL(n)$, $V = Sym({\mathbb C}^m \otimes {\mathbb C}^n)$. 

I have a nontrivial map from this space to $\mathbb Z$, so I know it's at least $1$-dimensional. I've computed it in a number of examples $(G,\theta)$ and could probably give an exhaustive proof, but of course I'd rather a well-motivated one. EDIT: it's equivalent to ask if $(1+v\theta)(1-w\theta) = 1+(v-w)\theta-vw^{-1}$ has rank $1$. (Not that this has helped me.) EDIT: Actually I don't care about all the twisted involutions -- only those in the image of $K\backslash G/B \to B\backslash G/B \cong W$, $g \mapsto \theta(g)^{-1} g$. (For example, in the $A_{odd}$ flipped case the image is fixed-point-free involutions.) It's harder to characterize the image than to give the definition of twisted involution, though, so I'm hoping the above is true in general. 

The 8-element quaternion group. It can't be reconstructed from its character table (D_4 has the same one), and every subgroup is normal but it's not abelian. 

For some long time now I've thought about making a poster-sized "cheat sheet" with all the data about Lie groups and their representations that I occasionally need to reference. It's a moving target, of course -- the more I learn, the more stuff I'd want to see on such a poster! There are many obvious things I think everybody would agree should be there. The finite and affine Dynkin diagrams, with the Bourbaki numbering and also the coefficients of the simple roots in the highest root. The dimensions of the fundamental representations. Coordinate descriptions of each of the root systems, and of their Weyl groups. The exponents of each group, the Coxeter number, and the structure of the center. The exceptional isomorphisms of low-rank groups. Only slightly less obvious: Satake diagrams. Dynkin's characterization of the nilpotents. Geometric descriptions of the partial flag manifolds $G/P$. The classification of real symmetric spaces. One suggestion per answer, please, but otherwise, go wild! I'm not promising to actually make this thing in any timely manner, but would look to the votes on answers to prioritize what actually makes it onto the poster. 

Let $\lambda$ be a dominant integral weight of $\mathfrak g$, a finite-dimensional reductive Lie algebra over $\mathbb C$. Let $M(w\cdot \lambda)$ denote the Verma module with high weight $w\cdot \lambda := w(\lambda+\rho)-\rho$. Then there are known inclusions $M(w\cdot \lambda) \hookrightarrow M(\lambda)$, for each $w$, and for this question we identify them with their images. 

Let $R$ be a commutative ring, with whatever hypotheses let you answer the question -- e.g. Noetherian, local, finitely generated over $\mathbb C$. Let $I$ be the ideal defining the singular locus in Spec $R$. (With the reduced subscheme structure, or defined using minors of a Jacobian matrix, again whatever helps.) Is it obvious and/or true that any derivation $d:R \to R$, i.e. additive map satisfying the Leibniz rule $d(ab) = a\ db + b\ da$, has $dI \leq I$? Morally, $d$ is defining an infinitesimal automorphism of Spec $R$, and the singular locus should be preserved by automorphisms. So I would have hoped that there was a mindless proof using the Jacobian, but I haven't found one. As usual, a reference would be even better than a proof. 

Observe that your set of inequalities is $S_n$-invariant, hence your polytope is, hence your set of vertices is. So it's enough to understand the case $x_1 \leq \ldots \leq x_n$. Now you don't need to think about general $S$; for each $|S|$ the tightest inequality comes from $S = [n-|S|+1,n]$ a terminal interval. The $|S|=n$ inequality is actually your first equality, so $n-1$ inequalities remain, which is the dimension. If you impose those as equalities (as მამუკა ჯიბლაძე suggests), and take their differences, you get $x_i = i$ for each $i$. 

For me, it has come up in studying conormal varieties to Schubert varieties. ADDED: Here's a familiar subcase. The diagram of $\pi$ is the set of boxes not crossed out in its SE hooks. If this is a partition in the NW corner, $\pi$ is called dominant, and every partition arises from a unique $\pi$. In this case, $w_0 \rho w_0$ is also dominant, and its diagram is (the rotation of) the complementary partition. 

This way it's a CW-complex, so studiable by standard tools of algebraic topology (pretty close to Donu's comment). For a striking example of how these things can depend on the definition, look at the infinite unitary groups $U(\infty)$ vs. $U({\mathbb H})$, where the first is defined as $\bigcup U(n)$ and the second as the group of all unitary operators on Hilbert space. Then $U(\infty)$ has very interesting homotopy ($\pi_n(U(\infty)) = 0$ if $2|n$, $= {\mathbb Z}$ if not), whereas $U({\mathbb H})$ is contractible. 

One of Grothendieck's dicta about algebraic geometry is to consider "the relative situation", where one doesn't consider the category of schemes but of schemes over a fixed base scheme. In Bayesian probability, one computes probabilities of events given new knowledge, but only upon having specified a "prior". Is there any categorical interpretation of the latter process, where specifying the prior is visibly analogous to specifying a base scheme? 

Here's something a bit less numerical, but more satisfying, I think. For each vertex $v$ of the polytope $P$, let $v'$ be the set of vectors $\vec w$ such that $\langle \vec w, v-p \rangle \geq 0$ for all $p\in P$. This is a polyhedral cone. If $P$ is very round at $v$, then $v'$ is very sharp. Theorem: if $P$ is a compact convex polytope, then the cones {$v'$} exactly cover space (at least, their interiors don't intersect). The set of cones $v^*$ is called the "dual fan" to $P$. You can read about it in Fulton's book on toric varieties. 

I think you're absolutely right that the function $(i\in \mathbb N)\mapsto $interestingness($H^i$) is a rapidly decreasing function. I heard that Gel$'$fand compared it to the successive derivatives of position: we care about speed and acceleration, possibly about jerk, not so much about jounce or beyond. However, you very often have to have those $H^i$ if you want to define Euler characteristic (in whatever context), so even if you don't want to compute a particular $H^i$ you want it around theoretically. In the context of coherent sheaves, very often the approach is to compute Euler characteristic, give some reason that higher sheaf cohomology vanishes, and conclude that one has computed $H^0$. Serre gave a talk (around 1998) in which he explained that "It was once believed that the only good sheaf cohomology is dead sheaf cohomology" but "nowadays this is not the [politically] correct view."
