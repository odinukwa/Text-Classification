Edit: thinking twice there's a simpler solution. On $L^2([0,1])$, define $f(x)(t)=1+t^{1/2x}$ for $x\in\mathopen]0,1]$ and $f(0)=1$. It's free (because the $t\mapsto t^x$, $x\ge 0$, form a free family). It depends continuously on $x$ (check at $x=0$). For $x\le 1/2$ it contains all (restrictions of) polynomials hence spans a dense subspace. So for $x=1/2$ the span intersection condition does not hold. 

Note that this equality is as topological groups, where Hom is endowed with uniform convergence on compact subsets. Every such homomorphism is zero on $p^n$ for some $n$. Hence the given homomorphism group $G=\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{Z}(p^{\infty}))$ can be written as $\bigcup G_n$, where $G_n$ is the set of homomorphisms that vanish on $p^n$. Note that $G_n$ is open. By definition, $$G_0=\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z},\mathbf{Z}(p^\infty))=\mathrm{Hom}(\bigoplus_\ell\mathbf{Z}(\ell^\infty),\mathbf{Z}(p^\infty))=\mathrm{End}(\mathbf{Z}(p^\infty)),$$ because for prime $\ell\neq p$ we have $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbf{Z}(\ell^\infty),\mathbf{Z}(p^\infty))=0$. It is classical that $\mathrm{End}(\mathbf{Z}(p^\infty))$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}_p$ as a topological ring (details upon request). Hence each $G_n$ is isomorphic to $\mathbf{Z}_p$. Multiplication by $p$ maps $G_n$ into $G_{n-1}$. Also, mapping $f$ to $x\mapsto f(p^{-1}x)$ maps $G_{n-1}$ into $G_n$ and is an inverse to multiplication by $p$. So indeed $pG_n=G_{n-1}$, and we deduce the result. 

Yes, $V$ is finite-dimensional. More generally, whenever a compact group $G$ act continuously on $V\neq 0$, then there is a finite-codimensional invariant closed subspace $W\neq V$. To see this, let $G$ act on the Pontryagin dual $\hat{V}$. Then this action is continuous and $\hat{V}$ is discrete. Let $v$ be a nonzero element of $\hat{V}$: then its stabilizer $G_v$ is an open subgroup of $G$, hence has finite index. So $Gv$ is finite, and hence generates a nonzero invariant finite-dimensional subspace of $\hat{V}$. By duality, it corresponds to a closed invariant subspace $W\neq V$. This even shows that in full generality, every compact $\mathbf{F}_p[G]$-module is profinite as a $\mathbf{F}_p[G]$-module. Edit: I answer your two questions in the comments: 1) yes, the argument also works when $V$ is an arbitrary profinite abelian group and $G$ a compact group: $V$ is then profinite as $G$-module (same argument, using that $\hat{V}$ is locally finite). 2) is it true that there always exists an irreducible subrepresentation?: no: indeed pick $R=\mathbf{F}_p[[t]]$, $V=R$ (additive group) and $G=R^\times=R\smallsetminus tR$ (multiplicative group). Since $R^\times$ generates $R$ as an $R$-algebra, a $G$-submodule of $V=R$ is the same as an ideal of $R$. The ideals of $R$ are $(0)$ and the $(t^n)$, so $(0)$ is the only finite one. Hence there is no irreducible submodule. 

Proof:The irreducibility assumption implies that the minimal polynomial of $A$ is irreducible, hence $A$ is $\mathbf{C}$-diagonalizable. Since $A$ has only eigenvalues of modulus 1, it follows that the subgroup $\langle A\rangle$ is bounded in $M_m(\mathbf{C})$. Since it lies in $M_m(\mathbf{Z})$, it is therefore finite. 

We'll use the immediate fact that if $X$ is a noetherian space, then for every ordinal $\gamma\le\ell(X)$ there exists a closed subset $Y$ of $X$ such that $\ell(Y)=\gamma$. We also use that if $\kappa\ge 1$ and $Y$ is a closed subset of $X$ then $\ell(X)\le \ell(Y)\oplus\ell(X\smallsetminus Y)$, where $\oplus$ is the commutative sum of ordinals: $\alpha\oplus\beta=\max\{\sup_{\gamma<\alpha}((\gamma\oplus\beta)+1),\sup_{\delta<\alpha}((\alpha\oplus\delta)+1))\}$. In particular if $\ell(Y)$ and $\ell(X\smallsetminus Y)$ are both $<\omega^\kappa$ (for $\kappa\ge 1$) then so is $\ell(X)$. To prove the claim (2), if $\kappa=0$ there is nothing to prove, so suppose $\kappa\ge 1$. Suppose by contradiction the Krull dimension of $\mathcal{U}(X)$ is an ordinal $\beta<\kappa$. To get a contradiction, we have to construct a descending sequence $(U_n)$ of open subsets such that for each $n$, the Krull dimension of $\mathcal{U}(X;U_{n+1},U_n)$ is $\ge\beta$. Let $Y\neq X$ be a closed subset of $X$ with $\ell(Y)=\omega^\beta$. Define $U_1$ as the complement of $Y$. Since $\ell(Y)=\omega^\beta<\omega^\kappa$, it follows that $\ell(U_1)\ge\omega^\kappa$. So we can continue by induction (on the integers) to obtain a descending sequence $(U_n)$ of open subsets, so that for each $n$ we have $\ell(U_n\smallsetminus U_{n+1})=\omega^\beta$. By induction (on ordinals), the Krull dimension $\mathcal{U}(U_n\smallsetminus U_{n+1})$ is $\ge\beta$. The latter lattice can be identified with the lattice $\mathcal{U}(X,U_{n+1},U_n)$. Hence we have a contradiction and it follows that the Krull dimension of $\mathcal{U}(X)$ is $\ge\kappa$. 

The optimal number is $n$. Write $d_i$ the diagonal matrix with $-1$ at position $ii$ and $1$ at other diagonal places. For $i\neq j$, write $P_{ij}$ the transposition matrix $i\leftrightarrow j$, and $e_{ij}=I+E_{ij}$. First, as you observed, $n$ can be achieved. Indeed, $\langle e_{12},e_{21},P_{1j},3\le j\le n\rangle$ generate for all $n\ge 3$ (for $n=2$ take $e_{12},P_{12}$ instead). Indeed, for $i,j\ge 3$ we have $P_{1i}e_{12}P_{1i}=e_{i2}$, $P_{1j}e_{21}P_{1j}=e_{2j}$ and for such $i,j$ with $i\neq j$ we get $e_{ij}=[e_{i2},e_{2j}]$, and for a single $i$ we get $e_{1i}=[e_{12},e_{2i}]$ and similarly get $e_{2i},e_{i1},e_{i2}$. So the group they generate contains all $e_{ij}$, $1\le i\neq j\le n$, which generates $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$; since we also have $P_{13}$ of determinant $-1$, this generates $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{Z})$. Conversely let us check that $n$ cannot be improved. Consider a set $S$ consisting of $k$ such matrices (or their powers, to allow all $e_{ij}^k=1+kE_{ij}$). Consider the graph with vertices $\{1,\dots,n\}$ and an edge from $i$ to $j$ whenever some matrix $P_{ij}$ or $e_{ij}$, $e_{ji}$ occurs; label this edge with the corresponding element of $S$. If this graph is not connected, clearly this does not generate (some nontrivial direct sum decomposition is preserved). If connected, after removing edges we get a tree, and which has one more vertex than edges. So, originally, the number $k'$ of edges (which is $\le k$) is $\ge n-1$. In case of equality $k'=n-1$, this is indeed a tree. If all edges are of the form $P_{ij}$, then the group generated by $S$ is finite. Otherwise, there is an edge $e_{ij}$. Consider the subtree "on the left", that is, all elements in $\{1,\dots,n\}$ which are closer to $i$ than $j$ in this tree. It forms a nonempty proper subset $I$. Up to a permutation of indices (possibly changing the value of $i$), we can suppose that $I$ is an initial segment $\{1,\dots,i\}$. This yields a nontrivial block decomposition preserved by $S$ (all but $e_{ij}$ are block-diagonal and $e_{ij}$ is block-upper triangular). Hence if $S$ generates, then $k\ge n$. (This also shows that if $S$ generates an infinite subgroup acting irreducibly on $\mathbf{Q}^n$, then $k\ge n$.) 

The classification of indecomposable non-solvable Lie algebras in dimension $\le 7$ over a field of characteristic zero is a simple exercise. First, the semisimple ones have dimension 3 or 6: in dimension 3, $\mathfrak{so}(q)$ for quadratic forms in 3 variables, in dimension 6, the same over a quadratic extension, or products of two simple ones of dimension 3. Next we use a Levi decomposition $\mathfrak{s}\ltimes\mathfrak{r}$. If $\mathfrak{s}$ has dimension 6, $\mathfrak{r}$ has dimension $\le 1$ and is a direct factor. If $\mathfrak{s}$ has dimension 3, one has to discuss on $\mathfrak{r}$. If $\mathfrak{r}$ is abelian, it comes with a representation of $\mathfrak{r}$, which splits into irreducibles. If a 1-dimensional rep occurs, then it is a direct factor, so in the indecomposable cases the only possibilities are 2,3,4 and 2+2. (Note that if $\mathfrak{s}$ has a nontrivial 2-dimensional rep, then it is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$; the only 3-dimensional irreducible is the adjoint rep. In dim 4, I'm not sure in general fields, but in the real case both the split form and the non-split form have a unique 4-dimensional irreducible rep, which in the case of $\mathfrak{su}_2$ is not absolutely irreducible). If $\mathfrak{r}$ is nilpotent and not abelian then it is (by the classification of nilpotent Lie algebras of dimension $\le 4$, either $\mathfrak{h}_3$ (Heisenberg), or $\mathfrak{h}_3\times\mathfrak{a}_1$ (its product with a 1-dimensional abelian) or $\mathfrak{f}_4$ (filiform of dimension 4). In the last case, the derivation algebra is solvable and hence $\mathfrak{r}$ is a direct factor. In the first two cases, either $\mathfrak{r}$ is a direct factor, or we have the following: modulo the center, we have an irreducible 2-dimensional $\mathfrak{s}$-module (hence $\mathfrak{s}$ is $\mathfrak{sl}_2$); then this lifts to an irreducible 2-dimensional submodule in $\mathfrak{r}$, and we see we have the (unique) nontrivial semidirect product $\mathfrak{sl}_2\ltimes\mathfrak{h}_3$, or its direct product with $\mathfrak{a}_1$. The last case is when $\mathfrak{r}$ is not nilpotent. In a solvable Lie algebra $\mathfrak{r}$ with nilpotent radical, it is easy to check that $\dim(\mathfrak{n})\ge\dim(\mathfrak{r})/2$, with equality only for powers of the 2-dimensional nonabelian Lie algebra. The latter has a solvable derivation algebra and hence only occurs as direct factor. Otherwise in our case the pair $(\dim(\mathfrak{r}),\dim(\mathfrak{n}))$ is $(4,3)$ or $(3,2)$. Since in these cases $\mathfrak{n}$ has codimension 1, it has a $\mathfrak{s}$-invariant complement. So the Lie algebra has the form $(\mathfrak{s}\times\mathfrak{a}_1)\ltimes\mathfrak{n}$, where $\mathfrak{a}_1$ does not act on $\mathfrak{n}$ in a nilpotent way, and acts in the centralizer of the $\mathfrak{s}$-action. Excluding the case with abelian direct factors, we find $\mathfrak{gl}_2\ltimes\mathfrak{h}_3$, $(\mathfrak{s}\times\mathfrak{a}_1)\ltimes\mathfrak{v}$ where $\mathfrak{v}$ is an irreducible of dimension 2 or 3 and $\mathfrak{a}_1$ acts by scalar multiplication. So the list (dimension in parentheses): 

Proof: the obvious part is that if $k=\ell^n$ is an $n$-power, this can be viewed as the $n$-th power of the 2-sided shift on $\ell$ letters. Conversely, we first use that $T_k$ has topological entropy $h(T_k)=\log(k)$ (Proposition 8.16 in these lectures). If $T_k=V^n$, then we obtain $h(V)=\log(k)/n=\log(k^{1/n})$ (Exercise 8.4 for topological entropy of powers, same reference). Then $V$ is clearly isomorphic to an subshift (because for a self-homeomorphism of a totally disconnected compact space, this means that there is a finite clopen partition whose translates separate the points); furthermore this has to be a subshift of finite type, because a subshift of finite type cannot be written as intersection of a properly decreasing sequence of invariants subsets of a 2-sided shift. Furthermore it has to be irreducible, because periodic points are dense. It is also primitive, because the shift itself has an element $w$ such that for every $k$, the $k\mathbf{Z}$-translates of $w$ form a dense sequence (this proves that the shift has no continuous finite equivariant quotient other than a singleton, and hence its root as well). Now for an irreducible subshift of finite type, the topological entropy is $\log(\lambda)$, where $\lambda$ is the largest modulus of eigenvalues of the corresponding $\{0,1\}$-valued matrix (and actually $\lambda$ itself is eigenvalue). In the primitive case, it is the unique eigenvalue of such modulus. In particular, it is an algebraic number that is (strictly) greater in modulus than all its conjugates. This is not the case of $k^{1/n}$ if $k$ is not an $n$-power, so we have a contradiction. In particular, the 2-sided shift on 2 letters is a 1093-power in the group of permutations of $\{0,1\}^{\mathbf{Z}}$, but not in the group of self-homeomorphisms of $\{0,1\}^{\mathbf{Z}}$.
