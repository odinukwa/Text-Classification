This means that interest rates rose in India at the same time that they stayed relatively low in other areas of the world. The fact that investors could get a higher yield in India led to an increase in demand for their currency (if I can get a 5% yield on Indian bonds, why would I get a 2% yield on US bonds?) This led to an increase in demand for their currency so that investors could buy Indian bonds/Invest in India at higher yields. The appreciation of the rupee (increase in value) led to India’s goods costing more (it took more dollars to buy Indian goods for example due to the currencies rise in value). This led to fewer goods being demanded (higher prices decrease demand). So Indias exports declined. 

The break even point that I remember from the Japanese debt crisis was at the point that the interest on debt surpassed tax receipts. If there is a point at which you can calculate expected tax receipts and yearly interest on debt, that would be a breaking point. I’d also note (less precisely) That when the inflation rates surpasses the interest on debt for a period, that will also lead to higher yields making the issue worse, so inflation has to be a consideration in this analysis of WHEN the breaking point will come. For example, if inflation is excepted to be 4% in an EU country with massive debt in 2030, and a 4% yield would be more of a debt payment than projected tax receipts, that is a breaking point. The only two options are an inflation crises, or missing a debt payment. 

That's an ok compromise, until you reach the usual section on "changes in the quantity demanded v. changes in demand". There, students are often told that we should only talk of a "change in the quantity demanded" if the demand function $D$ is fixed, and that such "changes in the quantity demanded" must be the consequence of a change in price only (typically following a change in supply). Then how can I speak of the comparison between $D(P) > \tilde{D}(\tilde{P})$ without being terribly confusing to my students? If I say, 

Should I use a different word and speak, e.g., of a "move" or a "movement" in quantity demanded from $D(P)$ to $\tilde{D}(\tilde{P})$ to avoid any confusion with a "change in quantity demanded". Or is it better to be explicit about the ambiguity? Or is it better to try and avoid the issue as much as possible? 

The question of designing matching procedure (between high-schools and students, med intern and hospitals, kidney donors and receivers,...) has been widely studied by economists and vastly contributed to Roth and Shapley receiving the Nobel memorial price in economics. I was wondering if you knew about any freely available code out there (ideally in a relatively high-level language) able to compute solutions to the main kind matching problems for some of the most famous algorithms proposed in the literature. I am thinking of writing one, but I'd rather not it already exists. I am chiefly interested in some piece of code to compute the solution to Deferred Acceptance algorithm in a school choice problem, but anything else would be appreciated. 

Profit margin is profit after the cost of sales. If you review an income statement, you will see revenue, and then typically a data field called “cost of selling goods”. Revenue - Cost of sales is profit margin. Net profit margin is Revenue - all expenses. So this includes taxes, interest expense, administrative expenses, and ALL expenses. An easy way to remember this is that profit margin is simply revenue - the cost of selling products, and net profit margin is revenue - ALL costs. 

It’s a means to an end, and to the mandate that these institutions imposed on themselves. We could also call it an “unofficial” mandate since politicians would likely put pressure on them in indirect ways to uphold their primary mandate. That primary mandate is a 2% inflation target. QE of course expands the money supply which can expand the velocity of money and keep prices relatively stable, as we already know. So QE is a means to that mandate end so that prices don’t fall sharply as we were beginning to see following the financial crisis. QE in it of itself is not a mandate. 

and finally, find a way to loop through all the forms in Choice.html; something like (I know the code below does not work, just to give the gist of it) 

This is only half a joke : Nash-equilibrium gives a very good prediction on the relative size of groups of foraging ducks on a pond when two food sources are established at opposite sides of the pond. A very good explanation can be found at $URL$ among other places ($URL$ is where the image comes from). In my views, this example illustrates how the concept of Nash-equilibrium can be sometimes characterize the "steady states" of dynamic/repeated games. 

You might want to be a little more precise about what you mean by "Revelation Principle" as there are many formulations of the "Revelation Principle" out there, some of which are stronger than others. Each of these formulations makes a different claim and relies on a particular set of assumptions. Of course, the claim will often fail to be true if some of the assumptions are false. (The following is from notes I got from a microeconomics class.) Consider for instance the following version of the revelation principle, which is from Repullo (1985), Review of Economic Studies: 

The concept makes more sense when you consider taxation and how that plays into the national debt. For example, if the government intends to spend 100 dollars, and only collects 50 dollars in taxes, the government has a deficit of 50 dollars. If the government does the exact same thing the next year, it has another deficit of 50 dollars. That brings the total national debt to 100 dollars. It makes even more sense when you consider the fact that the government can issue bonds to fund whatever it did not collect in taxes. A central bank can also buy bonds from bond holders if it wants to expand the money supply (stimulus), and allow the government to potentially spend more money that it does not collect directly from taxation. I know that this is a simplified model, but it explains the broader concept, that whatever a government does not collect in taxes, it must borrow. When it borrows, it must repay. When it has liabilities to repay, we can call that debt. When it does not want to raise taxes to repay those liabilities, the federal reserve can step in and buy bonds which increases the money supply, and can create an inflationary scenario. 

This is a point I find very confusing and very hard to justify to students. Depending on the books, one finds many different conventions regarding the sign of elasticities and marginal rate of substitution (MRS). Some define them taking absolute value, some don't, and one sometimes finds inconsistencies inside a single book or set of notes. My questions are : 

My favorite example is the initial formulation of Arrow's impossibility theorem in the first edition of Arrows' "Social Choice and Individual Values" (1951). In the first edition, Arrow claimed that, together with 4 other conditions, the following domain condition 

Notice that if good $z$ is free, one of the agents is not able to consume the other good, and she is therefore indifferent between consuming any quantity of good $z$. Hope this helps. 

Recently there has been a lot of interest on the use of minimum wage in the literature on optimal taxation. These recent developments tend to indicate that if a government aims at redistribution, minimum wage can often be a useful tool under imperfect information. The core intuition is that, under some assumptions, a minimum wage can be used as a tagging device to relief incentive compatibility constraints in the taxation problem. I have some (very) rough lecture notes on the topic. (One of the models reviewed is Lee and Saez 2012 mentioned in @jmbejara's answer.) See also a more recent paper by Blumkin and Danziger on the use of minimum wage to target "deserving poor" : Deserving Poor and the Desirability of a Minimum Wage. 

Lowering consumption, and increasing savings can increase net exports. Since savings increase relative to consumption, there is more money to lend out to the world (in an open economy), and less investment domestically. The decrease in demand for your currency due to the reduction in investment and rise in savings can lead to a reduction in the real exchange rate for your currency relative to other currencies. NX (net exports) = S - I (Savings - Investment). S = Y-C-G (income - consumption - government spending). As you can see, the level of consumption directly impacts savings. A decrease in consumption increases savings, which in turn decreases the real exchange rate for your currency, which can make imports more expensive, creating nominal price inflation. Another determinant of inflation however is also the money supply, and this is the biggest factor. The central bank in your country has the largest impact on money supply. This is because Y (output) is fixed based on the factors of production. % change in M (money supply) + % change in V (velocity of money) = % change in P (price level) + % change in Y (output). That is (% change M + % change V = % change P + % change Y). As you can see, the price level directly has to increase proportionately to the change in the money supply that the central bank can manipulate. So even if consumption decreases, nominal inflation rates will rise if the central bank is expanding the money supply. That is how it’s possible to see a decrease in consumption, and still potentially see inflation. 

I found an answer to the second part of the question here $URL$ It turns out that in , the variable which is passed to the template is iterable. Thus one the following code does the job: 

I would suggest that ask yourself the following questions (hopefully, this should help you figure out how to solve the problem) : 

$$ \begin{align} f_1^* & = (1+\delta) \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{(1+\delta)} \right] \\ & = \delta \end{align} $$ So summing up the two deals : in period $t=0$ I offer to pay you $\delta$ more in $t=2$ to postpone the payment, but then in $t=1$ you promise to pay me $\delta$ more in $t=2$ to get the money earlier. Overall the deals cancel out, I still give you the dollar in $t=1$ and no one owes the other anything in $t=2$. Case 2 : you have HD with discount factor $\frac{1}{(1+\delta t)}$. 

but there are many others, starting with the exposition of the expected utility theorem in Mas-Collel, Whinston and Green. I am also tempted to point at the following recent paper, although it definitely uses geometric tools which go far beyond high-school euclidean geometry:
