Consider the fiber bundle \begin{align} K\rightarrow G\rightarrow G/K. \end{align} Herein we assume $G$ is connected. Since $G/K$ is non-positively curved, it is aspherical (i.e. all its higher homotopy groups vanish). Thus, the long exact sequence of homotopy groups induced by the above fiber bundle implies the short exact sequence \begin{align} 1\rightarrow \pi_1(K)\rightarrow \pi_1(G)\rightarrow \pi_1(G/K)\rightarrow 1. \end{align} The inclusion of $K\rightarrow G$ is a homotopy equivalence (this requires proof but is standard and for matrix groups comes from the polar decomposition), and hence the induced map \begin{align} \pi_1(K)\rightarrow \pi_1(G) \end{align} is an isomorphism. Hence, by the previous short exact sequence $\pi_1(G/K)=1$ and $G/K$ is simply connected. 

The map that you have written down is equivariantly identified with the map \begin{align} \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{H}^3)\rightarrow \mathbb{H}^3 \end{align} where $\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{H}^3)$ is the bundle of oriented, orthonormal frames over hyperbolic 3-space $\mathbb{H}^3.$ Being a fiber bundle with compact fibers, this maps discrete sets to discrete sets. In particular, this does not require that the discrete set of points in $\text{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ forms a group. 

Here is a sketch of why you get a $(G,X)$ structure. On any sufficiently small open set you can find a parallel frame for the connection, which by the torsion free hypothesis consists of mutually commuting vector fields. Thus, these can be simultaneously integrated to give you coordinates. On competing overlaps, the frames are related by linear maps, and since the connection is flat, these linear maps are locally constant. Since the transition maps between these frames are linear maps, the transition maps between the coordinates are given by affine maps. 

First, every immersed minimal surface has negative Gaussian curvature, which follows from the Gauss equation, which implies its Gauss curvature is at most $-1.$ Second, geodesics in $\Sigma$ (with the induced metric) are very unlikely to be geodesics in $M,$ I don't know an example where this happens with $\Sigma$ not totally geodesic, though I don't know a reason why it can't happen. Regarding your question, every convex, co-compact hyperbolic 3-manifold which contains a closed surface subgroup (this may be a tiny restriction, I'm not an expert) contains an immersed minimal surface, which follows from results of Hass. So, the answer to your question is no, unless you get lucky and your minimal surface is totally geodesic. As an example, ask the question for a quasi-Fuchsian hyperbolic 3-manifold. Then, an immersed minimal surface is totally geodesic if and only if the manifold is Fuchsian. 

This question concerns the asymptotic geometry of a sequence of Riemannian metrics on a closed surface whose volume entropies converges to zero. Let $\Sigma$ be a closed, orientable, connected surface of genus at least $2,$ and suppose $g_{n}$ is a sequence of non-positively curved Riemannian metrics such that the volume entropy satisfies $E(g_{n})\rightarrow 0.$ Here, the volume entropy is the quantity first introduced by Manning \begin{align} E(g_{n}):=\limsup_{R\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\log(\lvert B_{\widetilde{g_{n}}}(x, R)\rvert)}{R}, \end{align} where $\widetilde{g}$ is the pullback metric to the universal cover $\widetilde{\Sigma}$ of $\Sigma$, and $\lvert B_{\widetilde{g_{n}}}(x, R) \rvert$ denotes the area of the ball of radius $R$ in the universal cover $\widetilde{\Sigma}$ where $x\in \widetilde{\Sigma}$ is a base point. It is a basic fact that the volume entropy is independent of the choice of base point, and the limit supremum exists as a limit independent of subsequence. Next, consider the normalized Riemannian volume measures \begin{align} \mu_{n}:=\frac{dV_{g_{n}}}{Vol(g_{n})} \end{align} which are probability measures on $\Sigma.$ Since the sequence $\mu_{n}$ is a sequence of probability measures on a compact space, there exists a weakly convergent subsequence $\mu_{n_{j}}\rightarrow\mu$. Now, let $h$ be a background metric on $\Sigma.$ With respect to the volume measure of $h$, the measure $\mu$ has a Lebesgue decomposition into a trio of measures \begin{align} \mu=\mu_{cont}+ \mu_{sing}+\mu_{pp} \end{align} which are the continuous, singular and pure point measures with respect to the background measure induced by $h.$ My question is the following: is it true that the singular part vanishes and the pure point part of the measure $\mu_{pp}$ is supported on a finite set of points. In this regard, this is really a question about the asymptotic distribution of volume for a sequence of Riemannian metrics whose volume entropies are converging to zero. For a mild bit of context, this question is born from considerations of certain sequences of Riemannian metrics with arise from a sequence of minimal surfaces in symmetric spaces, and I am asking because I want to try to isolate an issue which might have a general answer. This is closely related to the question of whether or not a nearly flat, non-positively curved metric on such a surface must concentrate its negative curvature upon a finite collection of points. Thank you for any consideration you may give to this question. 

A sketch of a proof of the real analyticity of the metric and potential in harmonic coordinates for the related gradient Einstein solitons can be found in the paper $URL$ on page 5 and 6. Once you know that f is real analyic, it follows by analytic continuation that the vanishing of the derivative $\nabla f$ on an open set $U\subset M$ implies that $\nabla f=0$ on all of $M,$ provided $M$ is connected. As is often the case with regularity issues for Elliptic equations, this proof ushers you back to a theorem in the epic book of Morrey "Multiple integrals in the calculus of variations." I should say that I'm nothing of an expert on these analytical issues, I just "know where to look." Perhaps someone with more expertise can give a more helpful answer. 

Let $X_{t}$ be a family of compact complex manifolds over the disk $\mathbb{D}\subset \mathbb{C}.$ Formally, $X_{t}$ is the fiber over $t\in\mathbb{D}$ of a proper, holomorphic submersion of a complex manifold $\mathcal{X}$ onto $\mathbb{D}.$ Suppose $E_{t}$ is a family of holomorphic vector bundles over $X_{t}$ equipped with a family of holomorphic flat connections $\nabla^{t}.$ If $\mathbb{V}_{t}$ denotes the local system prescribed by $\nabla^{t},$ we have the inclusion of sheaves $0\rightarrow \mathbb{V}_{t}\rightarrow \mathcal{E}_{t}$ where $\mathcal{E}_{t}$ is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic sections of $E_{t}.$ Suppose that for all $t\neq 0$ in the disk, the induced map $H^{1}(X_{t}, \mathbb{V}_{t})\rightarrow H^{1}(X_{t}, \mathcal{E}_{t})$ is an isomorphism. Question: Does it follow that the induced map over zero $H^{1}(X_{0}, \mathbb{V}_{0})\rightarrow H^{1}(X_{0}, \mathcal{E}_{0})$ is an isomorphism? If it makes life any better, I am happy to assume that the dimension of $H^{1}(X_{t}, \mathbb{V}_{t})$ is constant over all of $\mathbb{D}.$ I suspect the answer is no, but haven't unearthed a counterexample as of yet. Thank you for any insight you can provide. 

Just to start, there are some restrictions given by the Koebe $\frac{1}{4}$-theorem, which says that given an injective conformal map, \begin{align} f:\mathbb{D}\rightarrow \mathbb{C}, \end{align} the image of $f$ contains the ball $B\left(f(0),\frac{\lvert f'(0) \rvert}{4}\right)\subset \mathbb{C}.$ It is also worth mentioning the nice generalization of Koebe's theorem to quasi-conformal maps by Gehring & Astala here: $URL$ 

There are, at least, many examples where this is false. For instance, Hitchin showed (I think this was his thesis) that there is a sequence of metrics $\{g_k\}_{k=1}^{\infty}$ on the three sphere such that the kernel of the Dirac operator associated to $g_{k}$ has dimension at least $k.$ It is stated as a conjecture in these notes $URL$ that this is a generic phenomena for spin manifolds of dimension at least three. In the case where $E=F=M\times \mathbb{R},$ I don't have any examples in mind off the top of my head, but I could imagine one could construct a family of metrics $\{g_{k}\}$ and a family of functions $f_{k}:M\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that the sequence of elliptic operators \begin{align} D_{k}=\Delta_{g_{k}} + f_{k} \end{align} has arbitrarily large kernel. With this in mind, it's hard to imagine a circumstance where what you are asking is true. A better question might be: for some sensible elliptic operator that depends on a parameter, like the Dirac operator on a spin manifold depending on a Riemannian metric, can you find sensible geometric bounds on the Riemannian metric under which this kernel has a uniform bound. 

There is a quick explanation of the translation of Maxwell's equations into connection/curvature language in this bulletin article by Edward Witten: $URL$ 

In general, I would expect this to be a quite intractable problem. For instance, let's assume we are only interested in the category of manifolds, and we ask the question which $3$-manifolds are covered by $\mathbb{R}^{3}.$ Here, by the solution to the geometrization conjecture for $3$-manifolds, every closed, orientable, irreducible and atoroidal $3$-manifold with infinite fundamental group is hyperbolic, and is therefore covered by $\mathbb{R}^{3}.$ In fact, most of the $8$ model geometries in $3$-dimensions are diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, with the exceptions being $S^{2}\times \mathbb{R}$ and $S^{3},$ and therefore in a sense which I won't make precise, the building blocks of "most" $3$-manifolds are covered by $\mathbb{R}^{3}.$ The sense in which you call this a classification of $3$-manifolds covered by $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is up for debate. In general, every closed aspherical manifold has contractible universal cover, of which $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the usual candidate, so hoping to classify the topological spaces covered by $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ would include a classification of "most" aspherical manifolds. You might ask for a much coarser classification, but this at least shows that the problem is very complicated. 

No, homotopic maps have the same degree, but it's an exercise (common to qualifying exams) to construct maps of any degree from a closed, oriented, connected $n$-manifold X to the $n$-sphere. It is less trivial, and I think due to Hopf, that two maps $f,g: X\rightarrow S^n$ are homotopic if and only if they have the same degree. Hence, the components of this space are labelled by the degree of the mapping. 

As Ben noted above and in the comments, my answer doesn't make any sense. Please ignore what follows and I apologize for wasting your time. $\textbf{IGNORE:}$ Given a conformal map $\phi: \mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}\times \mathbb{S}^{1},$ we may lift to a conformal map $\widetilde{\phi}: \mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{3}.$ By Liouville's theorem ($URL$ the map $\phi$ is a Mobius transformation, in particular it is the restriction of a diffeomorphism $\mathbb{S}^{3}\rightarrow \mathbb{S}^{3}$ which maps $\infty$ to $\infty.$ But, the map $\widetilde{\phi}$ satisfies, in particular, $\widetilde{\phi}(0,0,1)=\widetilde{\phi}(0,0,n),$ as a result of the fact that it is a lift. Here, we have normalized the deck group of the cover $\mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}\times \mathbb{S}^{1}$ to be generated by the action $(x,y,z)\mapsto (x,y,z+1).$ This proves that $\widetilde{\phi}$ can not be the restriction of a diffeomorphism $\mathbb{S}^{3}\rightarrow \mathbb{S}^{3}$ (or even a bijection), and therefore, there is no conformal map $\phi:\mathbb{R}^{3}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2}\times \mathbb{S}^{1}.$ $\textbf{IGNORE}$ 

Suppose $(M,g)$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and $(E, \nabla, \lambda, B)$ is the following data: 1) $E$ is a complex vector bundle over $M.$ 2) $\nabla$ is a flat connection. 3) $B$ is a symmetric, non-degenerate, parallel bi-linear form. 4) $\lambda$ is a "Cartan involution," that is, $\lambda$ is an anti-linear involution on $E$ such that $H(u,v):=-B(u,\lambda(v))$ is a Hermitian inner product. Here $u,v$ are sections of $E.$ Then given $\alpha \otimes u$ and $\beta\otimes v$ differential $k$-forms with values in $E,$ (so $u,v$ are sections of $E),$ then form the $L^2$-pairing via \begin{align} (\alpha\otimes u, \beta\otimes v):=\int_{M} \alpha\wedge *\beta \ H(u,v) \end{align} Here $*$ is the Hodge star operator given by the metric $g$ on $M.$ With respect to the metric $H,$ the flat connection splits as $\nabla=\nabla^{H}+\Psi$ where $\nabla^{H}$ is an $H$-unitary connection and $\Psi$ is a one-form with values in Hermitian endomorphisms of $E.$ Then we can form the exterior covariant derivative associated to $\nabla$ given by $d^{\nabla}=d^{H}+\Psi$ where here $\Psi$ acts on $E$-valued $k$-forms by wedging the forms and acting on the section via the endomorphism part of $\Psi.$ Using the $L^2$-pairing we can construct the Hodge Laplacian \begin{align} d^{\nabla}\delta^{\nabla}+\delta^{\nabla}d^{\nabla}, \end{align} where throughout $\delta$ denotes the formal adjoint of $d.$ Expanding this out using $\delta^{\nabla}=\delta^{H}+\Psi^{*}$ we obtain, \begin{align} d^{\nabla}\delta^{\nabla}+\delta^{\nabla}d^{\nabla}=d^{H}\delta^{H}+\delta^{H}d^{H} +\Psi\Psi^{*}+\Psi^{*}\Psi+d^H \Psi^{*}+ \Psi^{*}d^{H}+ \delta^{H}\Psi+ \Psi\delta^{H}. \end{align} In the above line juxtaposition stands for composition of operators. I've found it claimed in a few places in a similar context that \begin{align} d^H \Psi^{*}+ \Psi^{*}d^{H}+ \delta^{H}\Psi+ \Psi\delta^{H}=0. \end{align} Nonetheless, after calculating for hours on end, I can't seem to work this out. It's highly likely that I'm doing something wrong, but now I'm getting nervous that perhaps I've misread the context where I previously found this formula stated. Thus, if there's anyone that can verify that this formula is true in this context I would be very grateful. I've seen a couple papers claim that this is contained in the Annals paper of Matsushima and Murakami entitled "On vector bundle valued harmonic forms and automorphic forms on symmetric Riemannian manifolds." Nonetheless, I haven't been able to find this calculation in that paper, and even still I believe the context is a bit different. Thank you very much for your help.
