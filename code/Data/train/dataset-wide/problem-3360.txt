Verify the replacement drive has the same KeyID as the other SEDs and that it is Locked. Note: The drive has to be Locked to enable storage encryption on the drive. 

Did you do an when you "backed up" the WsusContent folder? This will then have created a cab file that you could have imported into your new server (which would create the database when you reinstall) If you did not do an export of your data I don't believe you will have a cab file to import that data back. The command will check the update metadata in your database to the corresponding update files that are stored in WsusContent to check if they are missing or corrupt. If so, it will download them again. 

Dis[lays the drives assigned to the storage controller and the current KeyID used on the Storage System. Write down the encryption KeyID to be used for the next command. 

If they haven't already done so, try running fsck which will check the consistency of the file system. Do you get this error when trying to do any other tasks, maybe ? There is some sort of communication error going on 

Also check your resolver file as well and delete the ssl directory in both areas then restart the sync process. Obviously you know the puppetca --list command to check to see if a certificate needs to be signed. You may also try to turn off your firewall and see if that allows the connection. Check out the /etc/hosts to make sure its all there. 

We know this password to be correct, but since these two domains (Win2000 & Win2008) do not have a trust setup what authentication account needs to be used? One that resides on the Win2000 hosted domain? 

From here you can see the Name and Description of each snap in. You then can verify against another computer or your own knowledge of what you expect to see. 

To be honest, its very difficult to find the parts that are compatible with ESXi. Especially building from scratch. You are way better off going to a site such as ebay for a used desktop of sorts. Personally, I picked up a Dell T5500 for $525 (Dual Quad-Core processors, 16GB of RAM, RAID card). Otherwise your first step will be to check what is compatible and what is not. 

I just installed a fresh copy of dovecot on my VPS. I am also running postfix, and I first went through this guide I followed everything as explained. However when I try to send an email from my iPhone I'm getting the following error,

Some tidbits, 1) dummy is a single 10MB file on my local system. 2) I can successfully ssh in the remote Digital Ocean with the below command, $ ssh nathan 2.1) I have a "config" file in /Users/$USER/.ssh/ 2.2) The contents of the /Users/$USER/.ssh/config Host nathan HostName $REMOTE_IP_ADDRESS i.e. 1.2.3.4 User $REMOTE_USERNAME chris port $SSH_PORT_# 4242 IdentityFile /Users/$USER/.ssh/id_rsa 3) I can also ssh into the remote Digital Ocean droplet with the below command 

Your question is a little hard to decipher but I think I understand. It is better to create a distribution list within Active Directory thus allowing all your users to easily send mail using the DL. If you create this in exchange itself your users must then share this address with others so they may add it their own outlook. 

For security reasons, we need to "lock" some of the preferences in Mozilla Firefox. We are running Windows XP and the latest version of Mozilla version 14.0.1. In particular some of the security preferences such as . If the user were to do , we would like the particular options to be greyed out so they cannot click on them. I have read that this can be done by adding the following in: 

ewwhite, You may have already come across this article but I had it bookmarked awhile back: $URL$ Hopefully this helps 

One thing that may help is to go into the registry at this location (assuming your speaking about MMC): 

This post probably belongs on SuperUser...Hopefully this can point you in the right direction, this card is made by Hawell a Chinese Manufacturer. Their website is found here. Good luck. 

Before reinstalling I would check to see if your Database is in single-user mode? Or possibly check the option to ensure it is set to 0 which will allow the connections to grow as needed. It has been awhile since I worked with SBS but I believe there is a wizard that you run that sets up monitoring reports. You could also try recreating the database (as an admin): 

I have heard some hosts will block countries that have a high level of malicious activity claiming they are protecting the customer. This however, seems ridiculous to me as well. Most will block IP addresses and not the entire country so it seems a little overkill to me. My recommendation is find a new host as they do not have the right to say who can or cannot visit your site. It is also possible it is something on your end, it is possible for yourself to block out a country using GeoIP 

I am trying to send a single file from the local macOS box to the remote Debian box (Digital Ocean droplet) The command I am issuing locally in Terminal on macOS 

So I have been trying to setup BIND / named as a primary / secondary name server for a domain name I purchased a while back because I switched my hosting plan from shared to VPS recently. I think I have everything setup properly (for the most part) but when I go to ping the domain name I have registered, the command prompt just says unknown host. I made sure I registered the name servers with the domain name registrar, and I can ping the name servers. So I know that part is working but for whatever reason I can not ping my domain name. The domain name I am referring to is chrisrjones.com The named.conf looks like the following, $URL$ The fwd.chrisrjones.com file looks like the following, $URL$ and the reverse, pastebin.com/Hk9pyEHu 

I've been trying to get rsync working for a couple of hours now, but haven't had much luck . I have a Digital Ocean droplet that I would like to send a file via rsync using SSH. local rsync running on macOS 10.12.6 installed via homebrew 

I'm trying to install Phusion passenger (aka mod_rails) for the default Apache2 install on a CentOS 5.9 box. I successfully installed the gem using the following, but when I go to run the next command, I get a warning stating that my system doesn't have enough memory, but I can continue with the install. It then proceeds to begin the compile of Phusion Passenger but then fails. Is there a place I can check to see specifically why the compile is failing? 

The reason Phusion Passenger would not compile was due to lack of memory on the VPS. I ended up creating a VM on my local machine, and installing all the same components, then compiling passenger on the VM, finally transferring the passenger gem to the VPS. 

I created rails application, and everything appears to be working fine, but I can't seem to figure out how to run the application in mode. I specified in the (Apache configuration file) for the site, I then restarted Apache, and restarted the rails app by running the following command in the rails root directory, I'm running Apache 2.x, mod_rails 4.0.26, and the rails app is 3.2.15
