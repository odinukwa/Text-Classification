Therefore, any del Pezzo surface violating the Hasse principle is unirational in every completion of the base-field (since it has points everywhere locally), but cannot be unirational over the base-field (since it has no points). There are del Pezzo surfaces of degree four violating the Hasse principle: the following is a beautiful example of Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer of such a surface S in $\mathbb{P}^4$. \[ S \colon \,\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} uv & = & x^2 - 5 y^5 \\\ [5pt] (u+v)(u+2v) & = & x^2 - 5 z^5 . \end{array} \right. \] Remarks. A del Pezzo surface of degree at least five cannot be a violation, since as soon as it satisfies the Hasse principle for points, it is rational. Hence, this example is "minimal" in this sense. In this case, the degree of unirationality of S over the completions of Q is at most two; I do not know if the surfaces over the various completions are in fact rational. 

I believe that the answer is "no". Let $A := S^1$ be the unit circle and let $W \colon S^1 \to S^1$ be a rotation by an irrational angle. Thus $W$ defines an action of $\mathbb{Z}$ on $S^1$ all of whose orbits are countable. For each point $p \in S^1$ define $S(p)$ to be the "backwards orbit of $p$", namely $S(p) := \{ W^n(p) | n \leq 0 \}$. Applying $W$ to a point $p$ we find that the set $S(W(p)) = S(p) \cup \{W(p)\} \supsetneq W(p)$. Since this holds for every point of $p$, we find that there is no point with the required property. 

It is certainly not irreducible if n=8 and d>3. This is analyzed nicely in the paper Hilbert schemes of 8 points, Dustin A. Cartwright, Daniel Erman, Mauricio Velasco, Bianca Viray available at $URL$ (and I think published in ANT). From there you can look at the references, especially I think the first paper studying in detail this problem was Anthony Iarrobino. Reducibility of the family of 0-dimensional schemes on a variety. Inventiones Math., 15:72–77, 1972. Note that, at least the arXiv reference above, deals with subschemes of $\mathbb{A}^d$ not necessarily supported at the origin. On the other hand, since for $n \leq 8$ the above is the only non-irreducible example, the "new" component must be supported at the origin. Indeed in the case n=8 and d=4, the extra component is a product of a Grassmannian and an affine space. EDIT: Let me expand on my initial answer. First a general remark: if a point on a scheme is non-singular, then it lies on a unique irreducible component of that scheme. Now, in the usual (not the punctual) Hilbert scheme of 8 points in A^4 there are two components, one being the closure of the component consisting of 8 distinct points, and one supported entirely at a single point (the point being allowed to vary; by translating the support, we can assume the point is the origin). In the arXiv paper they show that there are points supported at a single point that are non-singular and smoothable in the full Hilbert scheme (Section 4.4). It follows that such points cannot lie in the component whose points consist entirely of subschemes supported at the origin. We conclude that the punctual Hilbert scheme contains the "non-smoothable" component (necessarily supported at the origin, this one being a minimal example of a reducible Hilbert scheme), as well as more points, corresponding to the points described above (the ones appearing in Section 4.4). In particular, the punctual Hilbert scheme is not irreducible. Hope this clears up the doubts (or that it exposes my mistake!). 

It can read PDFs, and you can annotate them and merge your notes and original PDFs together into new PDFs. Big screen, so reading papers an the device works pretty well. And it's pretty much like reading on paper. (But physics papers in two column format on big pages can be problematic.) It uses an SD card for storage. I have a 16 GB card in the device, which is silly given that I have barely managed to put one GB on it so far. Open software architecture, so third-party software is possible. For example, xournal has been ported to the device. Also, the database format is semi-documented, enabling third party merging software (which is needed because the supplied software is windoze only). 

I can't resist trying my hand at sketching a proof of the general result given in Robin Chapman's answer. Let $F\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be any closed set. Let $E_0=\{x\colon\operatorname{dist}(x,F)\ge1\}$, and for $k=1,2,\ldots$ let $E_k=\{x\colon2^{-k}\le\operatorname{dist}(x,F)\le2^{1-k}\}$. Let $\omega$ be a standard mollifier, and put $$f=\sum_{k=0}^\infty \alpha_k\chi_{E_k}*\omega_k,\qquad\omega_k(y)=2^{nk}\omega(2^ky),$$ where $\alpha_k>0$ decays fast enough so all derivatives converge uniformly ($\alpha_k=2^{-k^2}$ ought to be sufficient). 

If some rectangle of measure zero has a side of infinite measure, divide that side into a countable number of sides of finite measure. In other words, you may arrange things so that none of the $T_j$ has any side of infinite measure. 

The canonical answer used to be Ingrid Daubechies, Ten lectures on wavelets (1992), ISBN 0898712742. It may be somewhat outdated by now, but probably still good. 

Possibly a more generic answer than the others: Use a bit of scaling. You are looking for a root $z$ near $n^{1/3}$, so put $z=n^{1/3}w$ and rewrite your equation, using $\epsilon=n^{-1/3}$, as $$F(\epsilon,w)=\epsilon^2w+\epsilon w^2+w^3-1=0.$$ Note that $\partial F(\epsilon,w)/\partial w=3\ne0$ at $(\epsilon,w)=(0,1)$ and employ the analytic version of the implicit function theorem to see that $w$ is an analytic function of $\epsilon$. 

I don't think the problem as posed has an optimal solution. This is a problem in optimal control, typically dealt with by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Your problem here is quite general, namely, a linear and unconstrained control. Thus the minimum with respect to the control variable ($x$ in your notation, $u$ in the notation of the referenced Wikipedia page) in the HJB equation does not exist, unless the value function $V$ does not depend on the control variable. In other words, an optimum exists only in the trivial case where the control variable does not actually influence the cost function. (A small caveat: Though I have sat through a number of lectures on optimal control theory, that is the extent of my expertise, so take this with a grain of salt.) 

Some people like nets (Moore–Smith convergence) because they superficially resemble sequences. I think your example shows that this resemblance is superficial indeed, and that nets are more complicated beasts than they seem to be. On the other hand, the theory of filters (due to Cartan) seem more complicated at first, but are more natural to work with once you get used to them. And they have the extra advantage of not seeming to be what they are not, i.e., souped-up sequences. (If this seems subjective and argumentative, so be it.) 

Let $G$ be the Dynkin diagram of $A_5$ and $H$ be the Dynkin diagram of $D_5$. Then $G$ can be extended to the Dynkin diagram of $E_6$, while $H$ can be extended to the Dynkin diagram of $D_6$. These examples satisfy your conditions. I would draw them, as they are not much more elaborate than paths, but my tex skills are not that good! 

I do not know about the local-to-global principle for testing rationality of a surface, but weakening "rational" to "unirational" it certainly fails. Indeed, del Pezzo surfaces violating the Hasse principle are examples of such a violation: I will sketch an argument below. Observe that 

I see that Sándor already gave an answer to the question, but I wanted to expand on my comment, giving an answer that does not rely on the Basepoint-free Theorem. It exploits the fact that ampleness is open both in the cone of divisors and in families, and that the family of divisors that we consider is parameterized by a quasi-compact scheme (namely $X \times X$, or more precisely $(X \times X \setminus \Delta) \sqcup \Delta$, where $\Delta $ denote the diagonal of $X \times X$). Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety and let $A$ be an ample divisor on $X$. For $p \in X$ denote by $E_p$ the exceptional divisor of the blow up of $X$ at $p$; to simplify the notation, denote also by $A$ the pull-back of $A$ to the blow up of $X$ at $p$. Lemma. Let $p$ be a point of $X$ and let $A$ be an ample divisor on $X$. For large enough $k \in \mathbb{R}$ the divisor $kA-E_p$ is ample on $X_p$. Proof. Let $B$ be an ample divisor on $X_p$. Write $B=B'-tE_p$, where $B'$ is the pull-back of a divisor on $X$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$; note that the ampleness of $B$ implies that $t>0$. Choose $h$ large enough so that $hA-B'$ is ample on $X$; we deduce that the divisor \[ hA-tE_p = (hA-B') + (B'-tE_p) = (hA-B') + B \] is ample on $X_p$, and the lemma follows. Observe that the Lemma implies that for $p,q \in X$ the divisor $kA-E_p-E_q$ is ample on $(X_p)_q$ for sufficiently large $k$, by similar arguments. For $k \in \mathbb{R}$ define $A_k := \{(p,q) \in X \times X \mid kA-E_p-E_q {\textrm{ is ample}}\}$. Since the property of being ample is an open property (see Lazarsfeld's Positivity I, Theorem 1.2.17), it follows that $A_k$ is (the set of closed points of) an open set. Moreover, applying the Lemma, we deduce that $\cup _k A_k = X \times X$. Finally, by quasi-compactness of $X \times X$ and the inclusions $A_k \subset A_{k'}$ for $k < k'$, we conclude that a fixed $k$ suffices for all pairs of points. 

Here is one easy case of a curve of genus two whose Jacobian is isogenous to a product of two elliptic curves. Let $p,q,r$ be homogeneous separable polynomials of degree two in two variables $s,t$ that are pairwise relatively prime and let $C$ be the smooth projective model of the curve with equations $$ \begin{array}{rcl} x^2 & = & pq , \cr y^2 & = & pr . \end{array} $$ Clearly, each of the equations defining $C$, taken individually, defines a curve of genus one, and the curve $C$ maps to both these curves with degree two. Also, it is easy to check that such morphisms ramify at two points (above the roots of the polynomial $q$ or $r$). Thus $C$ is a curve of genus two with two morphisms to curves of genus one. It follows that the Jacobian of $C$ is isogenous to the product of the Jacobians of the two curves of genus one described above. You can play similar tricks with more equations, to obtain curves with lots of morphisms to curves of genus one. Unfortunately, I do not know what conditions guarantee that the resulting curve be hyperelliptic, nor that the Jacobian of the whole curve be isogenous to the product of all the Jacobians of the genus one curves. 

Take a noncommutative noetherian domain $R$ and a multiplicative subset $X$ (say just non zero elements of $R$). The standard construction gives a ring of quotients $RX{}^{-1}$, and I am looking at modules over $RX{}^{-1}$. From these module constructions we can define a certain subring $S$ with $R\subseteq S \subset RX{}^{-1}$. Now $S$ depends on the construction, and in particular it is not obvious whether $R=S$ in various cases, but I have questions about the subring in general: 1) Is there a classification of the subrings $S$? 2) Are there any standard methods to show when $S$ is itself a noetherian domain? 3) Is there any criterion which can be used to determine when $S=R$? One thing which can be assumed about the $S$ which I have is that they do not contain any $x{}^{-1}$ for which $x\in X$ was not already invertible in $R$. Basically I am asking if anyone has looked at the classification or properties of subrings $R\subseteq S \subset RX{}^{-1}$ in any detail. My guess is probably, and I apologies in advance for not being an expert in ring theory (the motivation comes from $C^*$ algebras). 

Given a positive (or completely positive map) $\phi:A\to B$ between C* algebras, is there a way to construct an $A-B$ bimodule? This would more or less generalise the following construction: If $\phi$ was an algebra map, we could have ${}_\phi B$, which is $B$ as a vector space, with $B$ product as the right $B$ action, and left action $a. b=\phi(a) b$. If there was a Hilbert C* module, so much the better. (This is part of the idea that bimodules generalise algebra maps, and I want to look at the differentiable properties of bimodules.) 

This question is about mapping finitely generated projective modules over $C^*$ algebras (or K-theory classes - I don't mind much) under maps between algebras. If we have an idempotent matrix $P\in M_n(A)$ and a star algebra map $\phi:A\to B$ then taking $\phi(P)$ (applying to each entry) will give another idempotent. However suppose that we only have a completely positive map $\psi:A\to B$ -- what do we do then? One possible way would be to use the KSGNS theorem to say that $\psi$ is given by a Hilbert bimodule structure on some $M$ together with an element $m\in M$. The module given by the applying the map to an $A$-module $E$ might be taken as $M\otimes_A E$ (or rather the conjugate of $M$ to get the sides right...). However this seems to be a very non-unique construction, and likely far too big. The reason I am interested in this is the problem of calculating characteristic classes (a la Connes) for algebras which simply do not have any nicely calculable $n$-cycles. It may be simplest to transfer the bundle to an easier to deal with algebra. (Just as classically we can define a cycle on a manifold by using an embedded submanifold). However then we run into the problem that we often only have CP maps, not algebra maps... I would be grateful for any assistance.
