Let's take simple, extreme cases. Scenario 1: The good quality product and the bad quality product are being sold for exactly the same price. Buyers have absolutely zero information about the quality of either. Both have equivalent marketing and availability, i.e. the same number of each are offered for sale, they are in the same number of stores, stores are equally convenient to customers, etc. Then presumably people would buy about 50% good product and 50% bad product. Scenario 2: Everything the same as scenario 1, except now buyers now exactly which products are good and which are bad. Again, assuming both are readily available to all customers, then presumably people would buy 100% good product and 0% bad product. So the "no information" market reduces sales of the good product from 100% to 50%, and increases sales of the bad product from 0% to 50%. Of course in real life the situation is rarely if ever that clear cut. Some consumers will know which products are good and which are bad, while other consumers will not. Even people with perfect information may disagree about which is better. (I may prefer a car that can haul more luggage while you prefer a car that gets better gas mileage.) I may buy a product that I know is lower quality because I can get it at a store that is nearby while getting the higher quality product would require me to travel a long distance and I don't think it's worth the trouble. Etc. 

Your analysis of what demand curve represents is correct. Your confusion comes from the overly simplistic demand function that you chose. A "true" demand function would rather look like this: 

The answer is indeed A: Initial farm income is $\$5 \times 2,000 = \$10,000$. If the supply is $S_2$, then current income is below that figure. However, if the government takes away from the market 1,000 tonnes, then the supply curve will shift left by that amount, resulting in a new equilibrium with 4,000tonnes @ \$2. Therefore farm income is now: $\$2 \times 4,000 = \$8,000$. The government buys the buffer at market price, thus $\$2 \times 1,000 = \$2,000$. We end up with the same farm income as in the initial situation: $\$8,000 + \$2,000 = \$10,000$. 

We need to distinguish two things here: the intrinsic value of the assets, and their fair value, or market value. No matter how much the price of an asset changes on financial markets (say, stock exchanges), its intrincic value stays the same, all other things equals. Typically, you could use the cost of the asset to assess its intrinsic value: for a house, the price of its construction. For a share, the book value per share of the underlying firm. For bonds, the nominal (or face value) amount. But assessing cost is sometimes tricky. The book value might incorporate things that are valued at fair value. For real estate, the price of the land is a large part of the total cost, and it changes all the time. For bonds, you could incorporate interests and discount them, but you need to choose a discount rate. Thus we typically assess wealth using fair value. It's a concept precisely defined by IFRS (IFRS 13 - Fair value measurement). Basically, the fair value of an asset is the price at which you could sell it under normal market conditions ('at arm's length'). It is true 'value', as you could trade the asset against that amount of cash. To come back to your question: wealth is measured at fair value, or market value. Therefore, the $34.4bn were indeed destroyed, or disappeared, even though the intrinsic value may have been constant. Your second suggestion is correct. 

Whether the tax is imposed on the buyer or the seller doesn't make any practical difference. It's just an accounting detail. One might even say, it's just an accounting trick. I haven't read this particular book but I imagine what he was driving at with the "bowl" example was this: Suppose that instead of filing tax forms, etc, the government collected taxes on the spot: There is a tax collector standing beside the counter with a bowl to collect the tax money. The price not including the tax is \$10. The government charges a \$1 tax. So, scenario 1: The government declares that the buyer must pay the tax. So when you buy the product, you hand the seller \$10, and then you drop \$1 into the tax man's bowl. Scenario 2: The government declares that the seller must pay the tax. So the seller increases the price to \$11. When you buy the product, you hand the seller \$11. He then drops \$1 into the tax man's bowl, and keeps the remaining \$10. Either way, the buyer has \$11 less cash, the seller has \$10 more cash, and the tax man has \$1 more cash. Whether the buyer hands the tax money directly to the tax man, or the buyer hands the money to the seller and the seller hands it to the tax man, makes very little practical difference. We could discuss what portion of the tax is really born by the seller and what portion by the buyer. If today the tax is zero and tomorrow the government begins imposing a \$1 tax, it doesn't necessarily follow that the seller can continue to collect \$10 and the buyer will pay \$11. Increasing the cost to the buyer to \$11 would mean that fewer units are sold -- some number of people will not buy or will not buy as many for \$11. So the seller may conclude that to maintain sales sufficient to maximize his profits, he must drop the price to, say, \$9.60, so with tax the total price is now \$10.60, and the seller is paying 40 cents of the tax while the buyer is paying 60 cents. Or he may have to drop the price further, or not drop it as much. But whatever the optimum price ends up being, whether the government nominally collects the \$1 from the buyer or from the seller has nothing to do with how the tax is really being split between buyer and seller. There is the technicality that there may be costs involved in record-keeping or other mechanics of the tax. Like if the seller is required to collect the tax and turn if over to the government, then the seller has additional book-keeping costs. If the buyer is expected to keep records and pay the tax, then the buyer has book-keeping costs. But this isn't the main point. 

One of the key reason is to limit volatility. Indeed, it is sometimes better to have some pauses to calm down any aggressive movements. That is why most firms hold their earning calls post or pre-market and not during opening hours. It allows analysts to fully integrate the information published by the firm before reacting. Also, an exchange opened 24/7 would mainly benefit large institutions such as big banks, and probably hurt smaller stockholders, who cannot stay awake at any time to react appropriately to market movement. One could thus argue that the system is fairer as is. Chinese stock markets, which heavily rely on small holders (for the best and the worst) even have a pause at mid day. However, a lot of firms use ADR and GDR (depositary receipts) in order to be quoted on several stock exchange. Therefore, they might de facto be quoted all around the clock. FX markets and derivatives (in particular OTC) also have larger opening hours than regular stocks. And to add a final element, some stock exchange such as NASDAQ organise a pre-market quotation, which helps determine the opening quote by surveying market participants, though no transactions are involved. 

The traditional representation of a market, with the curves of supply and demand reflects potential transactions: for each price, we can derive the quantity that would be offered or asked. The actual transactions only occur at the market price, but ignoring all other intentions is too restrictive to define a market. For example, stock exchanges often give the possibility to agents to express their intentions (that is, the quantity they would offer or buy for a certain price) about a particular security, which will form the bid (supply) and the ask (demand). Even if the ask and the bid never meet, there is still a market as people are willing to exchange goods, though they cannot find an acceptable compromise. 

I am looking for some thorough papers on relation between money supply and inflation in short and long run i.e. how and why money supply affect prices in short and long run? I was trying to find some interesting papers on that topic, however i was unsuccessful thus i would be glad if you would help me with the task of find informations regarding this particular topic. 

Man has blue and red marbles. If he has more red marbles then blue one he wants to exchange one red for two blue($1R:2B$). If otherwise (more blue then red)he wants to exchange one blue for two red($1B:2R$). Are preferences of this man convex preferences? My guess is that they are convex because linear combination of random bundles is worse than any chosen. Am i right? 

Two countries A and B have identical production function $Y=AK^{1/3}N^{2/3}$, they are identical when it comes to all other factors with the exception that savings rate is $s_A>s_B$. a) What is the GDP to number of people employed ratio in those countries? Question is about Solow - swan model. How to apply this model in this particular case, because i am completely lost. 

Given that demand for a good X is equal to $q_D=393-2p$ and market supply is $q_S=p/4-12$. Find equilibrium price and quantity, consumer and producer surplus and draw a diagram illustrating the situation. Given that: a) $T=2q$, every single item sold is taxed. b) $T=20\% TR$ total revenue is taxed Obviously i have calculated the equilibrium price and quantity before taxation that is $p=180,q=33$.But i have no idea how to caculate those two values after taxation. 

I. The case for government revenue The rationale behind this argument is that it it possible to increase the tax revenue by lowering the tax rate. A. Laffer draw a curve which represent this: 

In a framework such as CAPM, agents are assumed to be rational, and usually to have identical preferences. All agents have access to the same information, and agree on the level of riskiness of every particular stock. As returns are a reward for taking risk, the price of every asset do not depend on the supply but on its riskiness. Thus, the demand curve is flat: no matter how much of asset A their is on the market, nobody wants to pay a premium which would lead to have a lower reward for a same level of risk. This models have very strong and restrictive assumptions, which is why we end up with this weird infinitely price-elastic demand curve. More complex models, with less restrictive assumptions, might produce downward sloping demand curves. 

What are the causes of lower commodity prices? There is no secret: the demand is falling and the supply increase. The demand is falling mainly because of the slowing growth in China. As China imports less commodities to fuel its industry, a large chunk of the demand on these markets has disapeared, leading to lower prices. But simultaneously, the supply keeps steady or increasing on most of the commodity markets. On the oil market for example, 2015 has been a great year of surge or expected surge: OPEC countries are committed to keep flooding the market, mainly because the Gulf countries can afford lower prices thanks to low production costs, while their competitor might not sustain low prices very long. Furthermore, the ban on Iranian exports is going to be lifted, as well as the ban on US exports. The market anticipate already this formidable future new supply, which drives prices down. The US are quasi independent as far as Oil is concerned, as the Shale gas industry has been rising in this country. What are the consequences of lower commodity prices? The first consequence is not really caused by lower commodity prices, but rather by the root of this price drop: China's growth is slowing. Therefore their is more uncertainty than before about this market. As a consequence of this, exporters to China begin to worry as well as firms who have factories in China, as a slowing growth and reduced imports might be the sign of a stabilization and potential lower inner demand. China being one of the world's biggest market, and one with a still relatively low penetration for technologies, it is indeed worrying. Thus, the stock of a lot of companies have been going down all over the world because of the situation in China, reflected in Oil prices. Another very important factor comes into action: most firms in the commodity sector have huge debt. Indeed, this sector requires big investments to begin the exploitation. Among others, Glencore's $30bn debt has been discussed a lot, but it is only an example among many others. In particular, their are two areas that are under threat: shale gas and renewable. This two sectors require higher investment than others. For shale gas, because the exploitation is costly and technically complex. For the renewable, because the R&D is costly and the production as a whole is costly as it uses high technologies. Lately, the partial default of Abengoa gave us a taste of what might follow. The debt accumulated by this industry is by no mean sustainable with such low commodity prices. 

Question still unanswered Ads in the boring business magazine are read by 300 lawyers and 1,000 M.B.A.s. Ads in the consumer publication are read by 250 lawyers and 300 M.B.A.s. If Harry had \$4,200 to spend on advertising, if the price of ads in the boring business magazine were \$700, and if the price of ads in the consumer magazine were \$350, then the combinations of recent M.B.A.s and lawyers with hot tubs whom he could reach with his advertising budget would be represented by the integer values along a line segment that runs between the two points a. (3, 600, 0) and (0, 7, 200). b. (3, 000, 3, 600) and (1, 800, 6, 000). c. (0, 3, 600) and (1, 800, 0). d. (3, 600, 4, 200) and (1, 800, 7, 200). e. (2, 400, 0) and (0, 6, 000). My attempt was to find a budget line which is $700b+350c=4200$, where b stand for business magazines and c for consumer ones. But i do not know how this would translate into the answers that are given. 

Given the company's production function $f(L,K)=L^{1/3}K^{3/4}$, find slope of the isoquant passing through $(L,K)=(20,40)$ is equal to $-4/5$ (K is on the vertical axis). I need to state whether the statement above is true or false. In my opinion that is true because i need to calculate $MRTS_{LK}$ which is obviously equal to $-4/5$, but the answer in my textbook is: $-8/9$. Thus my question is am i doing something wrong or just the answer in my textbook is wrong? 

Public sector has different features than private sector. In particular, private sector is very much focused on limiting costs, because it is supposed to generate profits and is held accountable for this by the shareholders who have means to exercise direct pressure. A government isn't really accountable to anybody. Politically speaking, it is accountable to the citizen of course, but national accounting and public budgets are such complex things that citizen do not exercise a high pressure on the government. Moreover, the government doesn't seek profit maximization but utility maximization, sometimes with moderate focus on the costs. Running a deficit can even be seen as a positive argument by the electorate. Finally, one of the most prominent factor is historical: public sector employees have long had high benefits, sometimes to limit bribery, by cronyism or just because they were in a position to grant themselves such benefits (refer to the wages of the Greek MPs). And it is a very difficult task to take back this benefits without strong reticence, strikes and other forms of protests. 

Your equation is sufficient to study what happens in the middle of the curve, but not on the tails. The upper tails has such form that you would actually purchase some units even if price goes up a lot. But the more it goes up, the less your demanded quantity changes. That is because the product has some utility to you, so you are willing to pay a relatively high price for one unit of it. But then, the lower the price, the more you could buy. But the more units you buy, the fewer utility it brings to you. While you might really enjoy eating an apple, I bet that the 100th will not taste as great as the first one, and you might be disgusted. That's why the curve does not go to infinity when the price is zero. Reaching a certain point, your demand for apple doesn't grow anymore.
