I reformulate you question as follows: suppose we a given a Riemannian metric. How can one decide whether there exists a complex structure $J$ such that the metric is Kähler w.r.t. this complex structure? Below I will explain how to answer this question in practice, i.e., if say a Kähler metric is explicitly given. Actually, if the metric is given by explicit formulas, sometimes one can relatively easy give a negative answer, and in small dimensions as the rule one can also find the complex structure $J$ or prove its existence. Easy version of the answer: Kähler metrics have the property that the curvatures commute with the complex structure: for any two vectors $X,Y$ we have $$ [R(X,Y), J]=0. \ \ \ (\ast) $$ Let us view this as as a system of linear equations on $J$ (the vectors $X$ and $Y$ are the one we choose freely, and we know the curvature since we know the metric). It is a very overdetermined system, in the case it has no nontrivial (i.e., $\ne Id$) solution (which is a generic case) the metric is definitely not Kähler. In the case the space of solution is two-dimensional, one need to understant whether the solution has only two eigevalues and both eigenvalues are not real valued. This is again an algorithmically doable procedure. If not, then the metric is not Kähler. If yes, we have the only candidate for the complex structure and one simply need to check whether Nijenhuis is zero. In the case we have many solutions, one could try to enlarge the system $(\ast)$ to get only one solution by adding to it the equations $[(\nabla_XR)(Y,Z), J]=0$ and so on. Formally correct but in practice not applyable version of the aswer. One need to consider the holonomy group of the metric, and look whether it preserves a complex structure. Relation between formally correct and easy versions of the answer. By Ambrose-Singer, the holonomy group is generated by $R(X,Y)$ and also by $ (\tau^*R)(X,Y) $ over all parallel translations $\tau$ along all possible curves. Since $ (\tau^*R)(X,Y) $ is almost impossible to calculate in practice, in the easy version of the answer it is replaced by its derviative at the initial point, which is $(\nabla_XR)(Y,Z)$. 

May be I misunderstood your question; I reformulate it as follows: whether there exists a regular embedding of a complete surface of constant positive curvature in $R^3$ and whether this surface can have complicated topology. The asnwer is: any complete surface of constant positive curvature is isometric to the round sphere or to its $Z_2$ quotient which is topologically the projective plane. There exists no isometric immersion of the projective plane and by the alexandrov theorem any isometric immersion of the round shpere is the standard immersion. 

The answer of j.c. given prior to mine is of course correct but let me give a trivial reason why (in big dimensions) every Riemannian metric after an arbitrary small perturbation is not isometrically embeddable in $R^{n+1}$, even locally. It is known that the curvature tensor of a metric induced from an imbedding in $R^{n+1}$ has the following form $$R_{ijkl} =h_{il} h_{jk} - h_{ik} h_{jl}, \ \ \ \ (*) $$ where $h$ is the second fundamental form. The formula $(*)$ is a very strong restriction on the curvature tensor, in big dimensions most $(0,4)$- tensors having the algebraic symmetries of the curvature tensor can not be represented in the form $(*)$. Now, by a arbitrary small perturbation of an arbitrary metric one can achive that its curvature does not satisfies $(*)$; the existence of such a perturbation follows from the fact that at a point for any (0,4)-tensor $T$ satisfying the algebraic symmetries of the curvature tensor there exists a metric whose curvature tensor at this point coincides with $T$. Thus, one can slightly perturb an arbitrary metric such that the result is not imbeddable. Since a small perturbation of a metric of positive sectional curvature again has positive sectional curvature, the answer on your question is negative. 

Of course any left invariant metric with respect the group of orientation preserving euclidean isometries (I believe that it what you call SE(n) ) is a multiple of the standard Euclidean metric and any invariant volume form is a multiple of the standard volume form. I do not really know what reference to suggest you basing on your question. Actually, your question belongs IMHO rather to the elementary geometry than to the Lie group theory and if I may I suggest you ``Geometry I, II'' of M. Berger. 

It is a natural requirement and is more-ore less equivalent to the natural analog of the leibniz rule. Let us consider the following example: $$ d g(v,u) = \nabla g(u, v)+ g(\nabla u, v)+ g(u, \nabla v) \hspace{1cm} (\ast)$$ $g$ is a $(0,2)$-tensor and $u,v$ are two vector fields. In the index notation this formula reads $ {(g_{ij} v^i u^j)}_ {,\ k}= g_{ij, k} v^i u^j + g_{ij} v^i_{\ ,k} u^j + g_{ij,k} v^i u^j_{\ ,k} $ The left hand side of the formula is "you first contract and then differentiate", the right hand side of the formula is "you first differentiate using the Leibniz rule for the product and then contract". I do not think you need an explanation why the Leibniz rule is a natural condition. 

By the so-called conformal Lichnerowicz conjecture (proved by Alekseevsky, Ferrand, Schoen) a manifold has either big conformal group or there exists a metric in the conformal class such that the conformal group acts by isometries of this metric. Thus, the answer to your question is the same as for the isometry group 

In $H$ you have two lightlike geodesics such that every lightlike geodesic intersects one of these two, namely the geodesics $\{x=y\}$ and $\{x=-y\}$. In $S$ you do not have such two geodesics. Hence, the regions are not conformally equivalent 

I add a small $\varepsilon$ to Robert's answer, which is a simple explanation and a simple example to what he said concerning the 2 dim case. Conformal structure of signature (1,1) on the surface is essentially the same as a pair of everywhere transversal foliations. Well, up to a double cover, to be precise. Indeed, for a metric, the lightline cone at every point is two straight lines in the tangent space intersecting at the origin. The foliations are given by condition that they are tangent to these straight lines. It is known (see for example sect. 5.1 of $URL$ that for globally flat metrics these foliations are somehow standard: moreover, any flat torus is a quotient of $(R^2, g=dxdy)$ by a lattice. It is also easy to construct foliations that are not ``standard'', say we easily construct a foliation such that it has a Reeb component. The conformal structure corresponding to this foliation is conformally flat, since in dimension 2 any metric is conformally flat, but is not globally conformally flat 

It may be not the answer you are hoping for but still: one can show (short tensor calculations) that, even locally, the metric of an irreducible symmetric space different from the space of constant curvature can not be a warped product metric. Now, concerning arbitrary negatively curved metrics: I do not really understand what you would like to know; let me give three answers on different versions of your question and if possibly please follow the rules and write the motivation for your question (1) of course a generic metric, even negatively curved, is not a warped product metrics. (2) Of course there exist examples of negatively curved metrics such that they are warped products near cusps -- just take a manifold of constant negative curvature and slightly perturb it locally, ``far from cusp''. (3) Warped structure relates to the existence of a nontrivial solution for the equation $$ \textrm{Trace-free-part-of}(\nabla \nabla u)=0 \ \ \ (\ast)$$ which is a system of linear overdetermined PDEs on the unknown function $u$. In a neighborhood of almost every point, metrics admitting a solution of $(\ast)$ are locally warped product, and warped product metrics locally admit a solution of such equation. On can show that complete negavely curved manifolds of finite volume do not have nontrivial solutions of $(\ast)$. 

The answer is ``no'', the pointwise condition is not enough. The example exists in dimension 1 already and can be generalized and made arbitrary weird for all dimensions. Consider a smooth function $v(x)$ such that $\bullet$ it is positive for $x> 0$ $\bullet\bullet$ it is odd (i.e. $v(x)=-v(-x)$). In particular it vanishes at $x=0$. $\bullet\bullet\bullet$ all its all derivatives (first $v'$, second $v''$, third $v^{(3)}$ and so on) vanish at $x=0$. Then, take the vector field $v(x)\frac{\partial }{\partial x}$, its flow $F_t$, and as the diffeomorphism take $F_1$. It can not be an isometry since it does not preserve any smooth or even continuous volume since it sends the interval $[-\varepsilon ,\varepsilon]$ to a bigger interval containing $[-\varepsilon ,\varepsilon]$. Its only fixed or periodic point is the point $x=0$ and at $x=0$ the differential of $F_1$ is the identity endomprphism so your condition is fulfilled. The example can be made analytic - actually one does not need that all derivatives are zero; the first two are sufficient. So $v(x)= x^3$ gives a counterexample to your statement (though of course in this case one needs to think or calculate to show that the differential of $F_1$ at $x=0$ is the identity endomorphism and if we assume that all derviatives $v^{(i)}(0)$ are zero then it is evident). Of course one can construct an example on a closed manifold (on a circle in dimension 1) of any dimension using the same idea. The idea of this counterexample is due to Ben McKay and is in his answer to my question Does for every vector field there always exist a volume form for which the vector field is a homothety? 

If I am not mistaking, your number is the same for all manifolds, does not depend on the metric and on the manifold and coincides with the packing number of the standard ball in the euclidean $R^n$. Indeed, two metrics $g$ and $g'$ on $M$ that are $\epsilon$ close one to another (in the sence that for any $i,j$ the difference between the components $|g_{ij}- g'_{ij}|$ is at most epsilon) have approximately the same numbers $N(t)$: $$ N_{g}((1- C\cdot \epsilon) \cdot t)) \le N_{g'}(t) \ \textrm{ and } \ N_{g}((1+C\cdot \epsilon) \cdot t) \ge N_{g'}(t) $$ where $C$ is a constant (depending on $(M, g)$). Since the number $N_g(t)$ growth asymptotically with order $t^{-n}$, this implies that your number $\lim_{t\to 0} \frac{t^n N(t)}{Vol(M)}$ is locally a constant. This implies that if we continuously deform the metric we do not change your number and therefore one can think that the metric $g$ is such that it is flat everywhere except for the set of volume $1/K \cdot Vol(M)$. For this metric your number is close, for big $K$, to the similar number for the euclidean metric and making $K$ bigger and bigger gives us what we want.
