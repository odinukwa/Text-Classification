I'm having a lot of trouble following all of the details, but the following obeys all conditions except 5c, and as I commented above something is wrong with 5c. Let $K$ be a totally real field with Galois group $\mathbb{Z}/4$. To be concrete, let $\zeta$ be a $17$th root of unity and take the subfield of $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta)$ generated by $\alpha:=\zeta^{1} + \zeta^{4} + \zeta^{-1} + \zeta^{-4}$. Write $\sigma$ for the generator of $\mathbb{Z}/4$: say $\sigma: \zeta \mapsto \zeta^3$. Our $\tau$ will be $\sigma^2$. Let $L$ be the quadratic subfield of $K$. In our concrete example, $L = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{17})$. The unit groups of $K$ and $L$ are $\{ \pm 1 \} \times \mathbb{Z}^3$ and $\{ \pm 1 \} \times \mathbb{Z}$. Take $u$ a unit of $K$ such that neither $u$ nor $u^2$ is in $L$. Set $d_1 = u/\tau(u)$. By construction, $d_1 \tau(d_1) =1$. However, I claim that $\mathbb{Q}(d_1) = K$, which is cyclic of order $4$, not of order $2$. The only intermediate subfield is $L$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $d_1 \in L$. Then $\tau(d_1) = d_1$ so $d_1^2 =1$ and $d_1 = \pm 1$. But then $u = \pm \tau(u)$ and $u^2 = \tau(u^2)$, contradicting that $u^2 \not \in K$. So we have now achieved that $d_1 \tau(d_1) = 1$ and that $Gal(\mathbb{Q}(d_1),\mathbb{Q})$ is not $\langle \tau \rangle$. I now just have to add additional $d$'s to make the rest of the conditions hold. Taking $d_1$, $d_2$, $d_3$ and $d_4$ to be the $\sigma$ orbit of $d_1$ works. 

Now, let me explain how to find this. Let $w$ be the all ones vector. The condition that $A$ is doubly stochastic is that $Aw =w$ and $A^T w = w$ (ignoring positivity for now). For any nonzero vector $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$, we have $Av =v$ and $A^T v = v$ if and only if $Av=v$ and $A$ sends $v^{\perp}$ into itself. This equivalence is obvious for $v=e_1$, and the truth of the statement is preserved by orthogonal changes of coordinate, so it is true for any nonzero $v$. So, I wanted $Aw=w$ and $A$ to preserve $w^{\perp}$. So, if $A$ is going to be non-diagonalizable, it has to have a nontrivial Jordan block on $w^{\perp}$. So I tried making $A$ be of the form $\left( \begin{smallmatrix} 0 & c \\ 0 & 0 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ in the basis $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T$, $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}^T$. At first I tried this with $c=1$, but some of the entries came out negative. So I redid it with a smaller value of $c$. (I knew this had to work because, when $c=0$, you get $A = \left( \begin{smallmatrix} 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 \\ 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 \\ 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 \end{smallmatrix} \right)$ so, by continuity, for $c$ small enough I had to get nonnegative entries. 

$F(v) = |v|$ works. To be more explicit, I mean $|(x,y)| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$. We have $F(u+v)^2 = F(u)^2 + F(v)^2 + 2 F(u) F(v) \cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between $u$ and $v$. When $u$ and $v$ are linearly independent, $\theta$ is nonzero, so $$F(u+v)^2 = F(u)^2 + F(v)^2 + 2 F(u) F(v) \cos \theta < F(u)^2 + F(v)^2 + 2 F(u) F(v)$$ and $$F(u+v) < F(u) + F(v).$$ 

For type $A$, see Appendix A of Kodama-Williams. They prove that all the edges $Hull([u,v]) \cdot \lambda$ correspond to strong Burhat covers. They also show that $Hull([u,v]) \cdot \lambda$ is the Minkowski sum of the polytopes $c_i Hull([u,v]) \cdot \alpha_i$, where $\lambda = \sum c_i \alpha_i$ is the decomposition of $\lambda$ into simple roots. Skimming the proofs, I think the second sentence should still be true in other types. The first sentence, however, uses the fact that weak and strong order on $S_n/(S_k \times S_{n-k})$ coincide, so I think this should not generalize. 

Does this help? $K(X) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ is a graded ring in the sense that it is isomorphic (by the Chern character map) to $A(X) \otimes \mathbb{Q}$, which is graded. I would perhaps prefer to say that it is "gradeable", since the grading isn't very obvious in terms of $K$-theory. The most $K$-theoretic way I know to describe it is that the Adams operators $\psi^k$ act by $k^j$ on the $j$-th graded piece. The corresponding descending filtration is the filtration by codimension. For example, let $L$ be a line bundle with $c_1(L) = D$. Then $ch(L) = e^D$. So $ch(\log L) =D$ and $\log [L]$, defined as the class $([L]-1) - ([L]-1)^2/2 + ([L]-1)^3/3 - \cdots$ in $K(X)$, is pure of degree $1$. Indeed, $\psi^k [L] = [L^k]$, so $\psi^k \log [L] = \log [L^k] = k \log [L]$. Let's abbreviate $\log [L]$ by $z$. The structure sheaf of the vanishing locus of a section of $L$ has $K$-class $1-L^{-1} = 1-e^z = z-z^2/2+z^3/6-z^4/24+\cdots$. So this class is in the filtered part that has degree $\geq 1$, but is not of pure degree. A natural question, to which I don't know the answer, is whether the integer $K$-ring has a natural grading $K(X) \cong \bigoplus K_i(X)$, which turns into this grading when we tensor by $\mathbb{Q}$. 

We'll write $X \preceq Y$ if $X$ and $Y$ are well ordered sets and there is an order preserving bijection between $X$ and an initial segment of $Y$. Lemma 1 If $X$ and $Y$ are well ordered sets, there is at most one order preserving injection $X \to Y$ whose image is an initial interval. Proof: Suppose there were two, call them $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$. Since they are not the same, there is some smallest $x \in X$ such that $\phi_1(x) \neq \phi_2(x)$ (using that $X$ is well ordered). Let $Y' = \{ \phi_1(x'): x' < x \}$. Since $\phi_1(x) \not \in Y'$, the set $Y \setminus Y'$ is not empty, let its least member be $y$. Then either $\phi_1(x)$ or $\phi_2(x)$ is not $y$; say WLOG $\phi_1(x) \neq y$. Since $\phi_1(x) \not \in Y'$, we deduce that $\phi_1(x) > y$. Now, consider any $x' \in X$. If $x' < x$, then $\phi_1(x') \in Y'$ and $\phi_1(x') \neq y$; if $x' \geq x$ then $\phi_1(x') \geq \phi_1(x) > y$. So $y$ is not in the image of $\phi_1$, but $\phi_1(x) >y$ is. This contradicts that the image of $\phi_1$ is an initial interval. QED We'll write $X \preceq_{\phi} Y$ to mean that $\phi$ is an order preserving map $X \to Y$ whose image is an initial segment. So $X \preceq Y$ if and only if $X \preceq_{\phi} Y$ for some $\phi$. Corollary: If $X \preceq Y$ and $Y \preceq X$ then $X$ and $Y$ are isomorphic posets. Proof: Let $X \preceq_{\phi} Y$ and $Y \preceq_{\psi} X$. Then $X \preceq_{\psi \circ \phi} X$. But also $X \preceq_{\mathrm{Id}} X$. So $\psi \circ \phi = \mathrm{Id}$. Similarly, $\phi \circ \psi = \mathrm{Id}$. So $\phi$ and $\psi$ are mutually inverse order preserving maps. QED Thus, we see that that the ordinals are partially ordered under $\preceq$. (Of course, expressing this concept takes us out of the language of ZFC, since it is a statement about classes.) We will next show that this partial order is total. Prop 2 Let $X$ and $Y$ be well ordered sets. Then either $X \preceq Y$ or $Y \preceq X$. Proof: Consider $X' := \{ x \in X : X_{\leq x} \preceq Y \}$. Consider the follow subset of $X' \times Y$: $$\Phi = \{ (x,y) : \ \exists x' \in X,\ x \leq x',\ \exists \phi:\ X_{\leq x'} \preceq_{\phi} Y \ \mbox{and} \ y=\phi(x) \}$$ We claim that $\Phi$ is a function. In other words, we claim that, for each $x \in X'$, there is exactly one $y$ such that $(x, y) \in \Phi$. There is at least one such $y$ because we can take $x'=x$ and, by the definition of $X'$, there will be map $\phi$ such that $X_{\leq x} \preceq_{\phi} Y$; take $y= \phi(x)$. To see that there is not more than one $y$ above $x$, suppose that there were $y_1$ and $y_2$. They would correspond to some $(x'_1, \phi_1)$, $(x'_2, \phi_2)$. (No axiom of choice here, I'm only making finitely many choices!) WLOG, say $x'_1 \leq x'_2$. Let $\phi'_2$ be the restriction of $\phi_2$ to $X_{\leq x'_1}$. Then $X_{\leq x'_1} \preceq_{\phi_1} Y$ and $X_{\leq x'_1} \preceq_{\phi'_2} Y$. So, by lemma 1, $\phi_1=\phi'_2$. Then $\phi_1(x) = \phi'_2(x)$ which is to say, $y_1=y_2$. So, $\Phi$ is a function. It is now easy to check (details left to you) that $X' \preceq_{\Phi} Y$. If $X=X'$, we are done. If not, let $Y' = \Phi(X')$. If $Y=Y'$, then $\Phi$ is injective and surjective, so its inverse is a function and we have $Y \preceq_{\Phi^{-1}} X$. If $X \neq X'$ and $Y \neq Y'$, then let $x$ and $y$ be the minimal elements of $X \setminus X'$ and $Y \setminus Y'$ (since $X$ and $Y$ are well ordered). Define $\phi'$ on $X_{\leq x}$ to be $\phi$ on $X_{<x} = X'$ and by $\phi(x)=y$. Then $\phi$ is easily checked to be order preserving and have image an initial interval, so $X_{\leq x} \preceq Y$. This contradicts that we took $x$ not to be in $X'$, and we are done. QED At this point, we see that equivalence classes of well-ordered sets form a total order under $\preceq$. 

Here is a proposal for a possible sentence with probability that doesn't converge. Actually proving it should be hard, and I'm not sure how confident I should be in it but I thought I'd put it out there: $$\exists_{w_1,w_2} \forall_{x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2} \exists_{z} \ w_1 z w_1^{-1} z^{-1} = x_1 y_1 x_1^{-1} y_1^{-1} \ \mbox{and} \ w_2 z w_2^{-1} z^{-1} = x_2 y_2 x_2^{-1} y_2^{-1} \quad (\ast)$$ As discussed in comments, it is thought that almost all groups are $2$-groups. The number of groups of order $p^n$ is $p^{(2/27) n^3 + O(n^{8/3})}$. (If we write $N = p^n$, this is $\exp ( (2/27) (\log N)^3/(\log p)^2 + \cdots)$, so $2$-groups overwhelm $p$ groups for other $p$.) This is a theorem of Sims. Let's understand where the $(2/27) n^3$ comes from. Look at central extensions $$0 \to C_p^{n-r} \to G \to C_p^r \to 0.$$ If we look at isomorphism classes of extensions, this is classified by an $H^2$ group of dimension $f(r):= \binom{r}{2} (n-r) + r(n-r)$; Sims writes this down explicitly near the start of his paper. If we maximize $f(r)$ as a function of $r$, it is optimized at $$r = \begin{cases} 2m & n=3m \\ 2m \ \mbox{and} \ 2m+1 & n=3m+1 \\2m+1 & n=3m+2 \\ \end{cases}$$ and, at those values, it is $\approx (2/27) n^3$. Moreover, this maxima are sharply peaked: The value of $f(r)$ for any other $r$ is something like $n$ lower. So, if we were to choose $r$ in proportion to $\left| H^2(C_p^r, C_p^{n-r}) \right| = p^{f(r)}$, we would be choosing the values above with probability $1$. In particular, if we were choosing $r$ in proportion to $|H^2|$, the probability that $r \geq 2(n-r)$ would approach $1$ for $n \equiv 0 \bmod 3$, would approach $1/2$ for $n \equiv 1 \bmod 3$ and would approach $0$ for $n \equiv 2 \bmod 3$. For fixed $w_1$ and $w_2 \in C_p^r$, the map $z \mapsto (w_1 z w_1^{-1} z^{-1}, w_2 z w_2^{-1} z^{-1})$ gives a linear map $C_p^r \to C_p^{2(n-r)}$. So, if $r<2(n-r)$, then this map can't possibly be surjective and $(\ast)$ must fail. (Actually, it only fails if commutators generate $C_p^{n-r}$. That feels like a probability $1$ statement, but the issue should be checked.) On the other hand, if $r \geq 2(n-r)$, I see no reason that $(\ast)$ shouldn't be true. This leaves two questions
