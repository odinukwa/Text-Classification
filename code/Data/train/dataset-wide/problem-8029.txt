I'd be interested in doing some computations in quantum groups $ U_q(\mathfrak g)$ that are conceptually simple (``is this element 0"?, and $\mathfrak g = sl_5$), but are somewhat lengthy to do by hand. Is there software available that can do this? (I.e. take an element of the quantum group and reduce it to a PBW basis.) I've done some Googling and asked a couple people who I thought might know, but haven't found an answer. (In particular, the QuantumGroups package by Scott Morrison on KnotAtlas doesn't seem to do reductions to a PBW basis.) 

(To be precise I'll explain my normalization. Identify the Kauffman bracket skein module of the tubular neighborhood of the (0-framed) trefoil with $\mathbb C[x]$, where $x^n$ is identified with $n$ parallel copies of the trefoil. When I say "N-th colored Jones polynomial," I mean the Chebyshev polynomial $S_N(x)$ viewed as an element of the skein module of $S^3$. In particular, the first Jones polynomial of the unknot is $-q^2-q^{-2}$.) (Again, to be precise, $S_0=1, S_1=x$, and $S_{n+1}(x) = xS_n(x) - S_n(x)$.) 

I think the answer to (2) is "no." If $A = \mathbb C \langle x,y\rangle / ([x,y] = 1) $ is the Weyl algebra, then the category of $A$-modules has a tensor product given by $M \odot N := M \otimes_{\mathbb C[x]} N$ as a $\mathbb C[x]$-module, with the action of $y$ given by the Leibniz rule: $y\cdot m \odot n = ym \odot n + m\odot yn$. But $A$ is simple and so can't have an algebra map to $\mathbb C$, so it can't have a counit. And I'm pretty sure this monoidal structure doesn't come from any algebra map $A \to A\otimes A$ (but I don't have a proof). For (1), Allen's suggestion sounds like the way to go, but I think there's a chance that the statement you get is "$A$ is a Hopfish algebra with $\Delta = A\otimes A$" instead of "$A$ is a bialgebra." (A Hopfish algebra is an $A-(A\otimes A)$-bimodule $\Delta$ that satisfies an associativity isomorphism, and such a bimodule gives the category of $A$-modules a monoidal product. See this paper.) 

I will start by saying that I am not a symplectic topology. However, in my research I now have on my hands a symplectic 4-orbifold, which I would like to understand better. Certain results for symplectic manifolds (e.g. Weinstein’s Lagrangian neighborhood theorem), if true in this more general setting, would help immensely. Therefore, I would like to know if the theory of symplectic orbifolds has been developed at all, and if so, where can I read about it. Again, I am mostly interested in 4-orbifolds, so even results in this dimension would help. Thank you in advance! 

So, the question was answered by Alexander Lytchak. I am writing down the answer for the sake of completeness. Consider the fibration between the universal covers $F'\to\tilde{M}\to \tilde{N}$. $\tilde{M}$ is contractible and $\tilde{N}$ is simply connected, thus we can apply the Serre spectral sequence with integral coefficients, and from it we obtain that $F'$ and $\tilde{N}$ are contractible. In fact, if $H^*(F')$ has cohomological dimension $a$, and $H^*(\tilde{N})$ has cohomological dimension $b$, then $H^*(\tilde{M})$ would have cohomological dimension $a+b$ and this has to be $0$. Then $N$ is acyclic, and from the exact sequence in homotopy so is $F$. Moreover we have and exact sequence $$ 1\to\pi_1(F)\to \pi_1(M)\to \pi_1(N)\to 1$$ where $\pi_1(M)$ is a Bieberbach group, i.e. a torsion free group with a finite index normal abelian subgroup. As for $\pi_1(F)$, a subgroup of a Bieberbach group is again a Bieberbach group and therefore $F$ is homeomorphic to a flat manifold. As for $N$, one can prove that there exists a normal abelian subgroup of $\pi_1(N)$ of finite index. Moreover, $\pi_1(N)$ is torsion free, since otherwise there would be a finite cyclic subgroup acting on the contractible manifold $\tilde{N}$ without fixed points. This is not possible, and therefore $\pi_1(N)$ is a Bieberbach group. Again, this implies that $N$ is a Bieberbach manifold. 

(Retag as appropriate.) EDIT: As Victor kindly pointed out, $\mathcal O_{\chi_\lambda}$ consists of modules where the endomorphisms $z-\chi_\lambda(z)$ are nilpotent, not necessarily 0. Also, to attempt to clarify (1), I was just wondering if there are natural functors between different blocks of $\mathcal O$ that don't come from tensoring with a finite dimensional module. 

Here is one interpretation of this set in terms of Hochschild homology. Let $A$ be the group algebra of $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb Z$, and let $B$ be the group algebra of $S_n$ (say over $\mathbb C$ for simplicity). There is a map $A \to B$ taking the generator to the $n$-cycle $(1 2 \cdots n)$, and this makes $B$ an $A$-bimodule. Then the set you define is a basis for the Hochschild homology $HH_0(A, B)$. (Of course, this isn't combinatorial, so I don't know if this is useful for your purposes.) $URL$ 

(I may have glossed over some things, like fixing an identification embedding of $\bar {\mathbb Q}$ into $\mathbb C$, or requiring $X(\mathbb F_q)$ to be smooth, or something else.) 

I don't know this story too well, but at least for type $A_1$ there is a 5-parameter family of symmetric polynomials called Askey-Wilson polynomials that specialize to the Macdonald polynomials. (I'm not sure about the story for higher ranks or other types.) These polynomials are controlled by the representation theory of a 5-parameter double affine Hecke algebra $H_{q,a,b,c,d}$ (introduced by Sahi, I believe). When all the parameters are 1, this algebra is $\mathbb C[X^{\pm 1},Y^{\pm 1}]\rtimes (\mathbb C\mathbb Z_2)$. (The Macdonald polynomials are controlled by Cherednik's double affine Hecke algebra of type $A_1$, which is isomorphic to $H_{q,t,1,1,1}$.) Oblomkov showed that $H_{q,a,b,c,d}$ is a universal deformation of $\mathbb C[X^{\pm 1}, Y^{\pm 1}]\rtimes (\mathbb C \mathbb Z_2)$, which in some sense shows that the Askey-Wilson polynomials are the largest family of polynomials which have similar properties to Macdonald polynomials. See $URL$ and references therein for more details. 

Question 1: is it true that $\phi$ is homotopic to an isometry of $S^n$ in $Diff(S^n)$? Here is a (probably) much stronger assumption on $\phi$: fix a basis $x_0,\ldots x_n$ of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, and suppose that $\phi:S^n\to S^n$ preserves any subsphere "main subsphere" $S^{n-k}=S^n\cap \{x_{i_1}=\ldots x_{i_k}=0\}$. Question 2: is it true that $\phi$ is homotopic to an isometry of $S^n$ in $Diff(S^n)$? Regarding this second question, my approach was to start deforming $\phi$ to be an isometry on the smallest "main subspheres", and hopefully going up in dimension, but this requires me to know that $\pi_i(Diff(T^k))=0$, $i>0$, where $T^k$ is a $k$-dimensional torus. So here is a third, kind of related, question: Question 3: is it true that $\pi_i(Diff(T^k))=0$ for every torus $T^k$ and every $i>0$? Thanks in advance! 

Let $M$ be a compact manifold, let $\tilde{M}$ be its universal cover, and suppose that the Euler characteristic $\chi(\tilde{M})=0$. My question is: does this imply that $\chi(M)=0$? This is clear if $\pi_1(M)$ is finite, but I am interested in the case $|\pi_1(M)|=\infty$. It might not feel right, but I can't think of any counterexample, either. Thank you very much in advance! 

EDIT: I was rightfully asked what I mean by Euler characteristic of the (non compact) manifold $\tilde{M}$. My answer right now is: the one you want! What I am thinking of, is $\chi(\tilde{M})=\sum_i (-1)^i\dim H_i(\tilde{M},k)$, with $k=\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{R}$, and $H_i$ are either the usual or the compactly supported cohomology groups. In my case, $\tilde{M}$ retracts to a compact Lie group. 

Reidemeister's classical theorem describes the set of links in $\mathbb R^3$ up to isotopy as the set $\{ \textrm{diagrams in } \mathbb R^2\textrm{ with crossings}\}$ modulo certain local relations on diagrams, each of which obviously preserves the isotopy type of the link that the diagrams represent. Given a surface $F$ with $n$ marked points $\{p_i\} \subset F$, one can consider its braid group $Br(F,n)$, where a braid is a set of $n$ oriented embedded arcs in $F\times [0,1]$, which start at $\{p_i\}\times 0$, end at $\{p_i\}\times 1$, and are always increasing in the $[0,1]$ direction. Then "braids up to isotopy" is a group, with composition given by "stacking in the $[0,1]$ direction." If $F$ is a disc, we get the classical braid group. We can represent a braid by a "diagram with crossings" on the surface $F$, where the diagrams consist of oriented arcs which begin and end at one of the marked points on $F$. 

Here's an idea for simplifying the problem a bit. I don't know the technical details or whether it will work, but it wouldn't fit in the comment box, so I'll put it as an answer, even though it's incomplete. First, answer this simplified question: If $\alpha$ is an MC-element of $(h,P)$, is there a morphism $(h,P_\alpha) \to (h,P)$ and a morphism $(h,P)\to (h,P_\alpha)$? (This corresponds to $\pi$ or $\omega$ being zero and $g=g'$, $Q=Q'$ in the original question.) Then compose the morphisms $(g,Q_\pi) \to (g,Q) \to (g',Q') \to (g',Q'_\omega) $, where the first arrow comes from $h=g$, $P=Q_\pi$, and $\alpha = -\pi$, the second is the given morphism, and the third comes from $h=g'$, $P = Q'$, and $\alpha = \omega$. 

Let $B$ be a simply connected space, and $F\to E\to B$, $F'\to E'\to B$ two fibrations with a map $f:E'\to E$ sending fibers to fibers and inducing the identity on $B$ (in my case $f$ is injective but I don't think it matters). Let $f:B\to B'$ be a map between simply connected spaces, $F\to E\to B$ a fibration, and $F\to E'\to B'$ the pullback with respect to $f$. Here as well, I deal with $f$ being injective. 

Question: is there some relative version of the Serre spectral sequence that allows me to compute the relative cohomology groups of $(E,E')$ from the cohomology of $(F,F')$ and $B$ (case 1), resp. the cohomology of $F$ and $(B,B')$ (case 2)? Some reference would be perfect. If some topological assumption on the spaces or maps are required, I am dealing with classifying spaces and Borel constructions applied to smooth actions on manifolds, so it is very well behaved stuff. 

Let $M=\mathbb{R}^n/G$ be a closed flat manifold, and let $F\to M \to N$ be a locally trivial submersion, where $F$ and $N$ are closed manifolds. My question is simple: are $F$ and $N$ homeomorphic to flat manifolds? This question seems quite natural to me, and I would expect the answer to this fact to be well known. Any reference will be welcome. Thank you in advance. 

Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$, and let $$ F=(P_1,\ldots, P_m):\mathbb{K}^n\to \mathbb{K}^m $$ be a polynomial map. I would like to know under what conditions the preimages $F^{-1}(y)$ of $F$ depend continuously on $y\in Im(F)\subset\mathbb{K}^m$, with respect to the Hausdorff topology. For example, this holds when $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$, and $P_1,\ldots P_k$ generate the algebra of polynomials invariant under the action of some compact group $G\subset O(n)$. However, I do not even know if the condition holds in the complex setting (i.e., $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{C}$ and $G$ complex reductive group). Although my interest is closely related to the group action case, I am primarily looking for conditions on the algebra generated by $P_1,\ldots, P_n$. Any reference would be welcome! 

If I understand things right, the Hilbert scheme of points in $\mathbb{A}^2$ is hyperkahler manifold and the $n^\textrm{th}$ Calogero-Moser $CM_n$ space can be obtained by deforming the complex structure. The disjoint union of the $CM_n$ parametrizes isomorphism classes of (right) ideals in the first Weyl algebra (polynomial differential operators in 1 variable). This classification is related to Hyugen's principle in differential equations. 

One naive attempt is to pick an automorphism of a fiber and then try to extend it to the whole bundle, but it seems likely that this rarely works. However, there are a couple "special" automorphisms of a fiber: the hyperelliptic involution, and the (non-orientation-preserving) "flip across a plane." Do either of these extend to a fibered knot complement? 

(EDIT: Powers of $q$ in the formula corrected.) I've been doing some computations with skein modules, and I found the following formula for the N-th colored Jones polynomial of the trefoil: $\frac{1}{q^2-q^6}\sum_{i=1}^{N+1} (-1)^i q^{6(N^2-i^2)}(q^{10i-4}-q^{2i})$ I'm interested in comparing this to formulas that appear in the literature. I'm pretty sure I've seen similar formulas before, but I haven't been able to find them again. 

I have an ignorant question about elliptic curves which I'll be slightly imprecise about. If I have an elliptic curve $X$ defined over $\mathbb Z$, I can base change to $\mathbb C$, and then $X(\mathbb C)$ is isomorphic to the quotient of $\mathbb C$ by the lattice generated by $1, \tau$ for some $\tau \in \mathbb C$. I can also base change to a finite field $\mathbb F_q$, and then the Frobenius operator on $H^1 (X( \bar {\mathbb{F} }_q), \bar {\mathbb{Q} }_l)$ has eigenvalues $\sigma, \bar \sigma$. 

It is well known that the Stiefel–Whitney classes $w_i$ of a smooth manifold are generated, over the Steenrod algebra, by those of the form $w_{2^{i}}$. I wonder if it the same statement is known/true in the case of odd primes. More precisely Question: Given a smooth manifold $M$, is it true that the Pontrjagin classes $p_i\in H^*(M,\mathbb{Z}/q\mathbb{Z})$ are generated, over the algebra of Steenrod powers, by those of the form $p_{q^i}$? In the case of the Siefel-Whiney classes, that fact can be obtained using the formula $$ Sq^i(w_j)=\sum_{t=0}^i {j+t-i-1 \choose t} w_{i-t}w_{j+t}. $$ As far as I understand, such a nice formula does not exists in the case of odd primes. Nevertheless, my question is much weaker, and I have the feeling it should be known, at least in the case $q=3$ (which I am mainly interested in). EDIT: As Oscar points out, the answer to this question is NO for $p\geq 5$. As far as I see it, though, it is not trivially false for $p=3$. 

First of all, by Morse theory you know that $\mathcal{M}^+$ is obtained by attaching an $m$-cell to $\mathcal{M}^-$, i.e. $\mathcal{M}^+=\mathcal{M}^-\cup_{\phi}e$, where $e=D^m$ is an $m$-cell and $\phi:\partial(e)=S^{m-1}\to \mathcal{M}^-$ is some attaching map. Therefore you can compute $H^{\*}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)$ by excision (you excise $\mathcal{M}^-\setminus\phi(S^{m-1})$), and get that $H^{\*}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\simeq H^{\*}(D^m,S^{m-1})$ that has exactly one nonzero cohomology in degree $m$. As for the second question, I think it's more intuitive looking at homology (it's the same since we are looking at coefficients in a field). There you have the sequence $0\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^-)\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^+)\to H_m(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\stackrel{\partial}{\to} H_{m-1}(\mathcal{M}^-)\to M_{m-1}(\mathcal{M}^+)\to 0$. Moreover, the generator of the unique nonzero class of $H_m(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)$ can be thought of the fundamental class $[e]$ of the cell you attached, and $\partial[e]=\phi_*[\partial e]$. In other words, the boundary operator sends $[e]$ essentially to the class of its topological boundary. If $\partial[e]=0$, it means that $\phi_{\*}[\partial e]$ is a boundary in $\mathcal{M}^-$, i.e. there exists an $m$-cycle $e_-$ entirely contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ such that $\partial[e]=\partial[e_-]$. In particular $\partial[e-e_-]=0$ and you can say that $e$ can be completed to a cycle, contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ away from the critical point}. Think of the usual example of the torus, with the morse function being the heigth $z$. Let $p_1$ be the second critical point (the first critical point of index one) with critical value $z_1$, let $\mathcal{M}^-=z^{-1}([0,z_1-\epsilon])$ and $\mathcal{M}^+=z^{-1}([0,z_1+\epsilon])$. Then $\mathcal{M}^+$ is obtained by attaching a $1$-cell $e$, that is a little segment passing through $p_1$ and "going down". Its boundary $\partial[e]$ is just two points in $\mathcal{M}^-$. You can check that $\partial:H_{1}(\mathcal{M}^+,\mathcal{M}^-)\to H_0(\mathcal{M}^-)$ is zero, and in fact $\partial[e]$ is the boundary of an arc $e_-$ entirely contained in $\mathcal{M^-}$ (for example the arc through the minimum point). it's quite clear that we just "completed" $[e]$ to a cycle $[e]-[e_-]$ (that you can see as a closed nontrivial closed curve in the torus) that is "almost entirely contained in $\mathcal{M}^-$ away from the critical point. If $\partial\neq 0$, this means that we are killing some cohomology, that we created at some point before. Take for example the sphere $S^2$, embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the shape of a "$\bigcap$", and again with $z$ as a Morse function (just wiggle it a bit so that the two minima have different values). Then from bottom-up, you first see two index $0$ points (the two minima), that give you two 0-cells. Then, as you go to the third critical point (the first critical point of index 1), you notice that $\partial \neq 0$ and so the contribution of that critical point is to kill something we created before. In some sense then, this morse function is not "efficient", in the sense that creates too many critical points, that will be killed later anyways. An "efficient" Morse function only creates critical points when they really contribute to the homology of the space. "Efficient" Morse functions are called perfect. Here is the formal definition of perfect morse function: as you said, every critical point of index $m$, might give rise to at most one new generator of $H_{\*}(\mathcal{M}_+)$. So if $c_m$ denotes the number of critical points of index $m$, we have that $c_m\geq \dim H_{\_*}(M)$, where $M$ is our manifold. The Morse function is called perfect if the inequality above is an equality, for every $m$.
