I have met this problem in solving the classical field theory of a scalar field with a cubic term. I am able to solve exactly each equation, given in a form of odes, but this question escapes my current understanding and I will appreciate any clarification, even in the form of references. I have to solve an ode in the form $$ y''(t)+\phi(t)y(t)=j(t). $$ A straightforward approach I can devise is using Green function. So, I solve the equation $$ G''(t)+\phi(t)G(t)=\delta(t) $$ and I would like to write $$ y(t)=y_0(t)+\int G(t,t')j(t')dt'. $$ The problem is that, unless $\phi(t)$ preserves translation symmetry, the above equation cannot hold. This can be seen immediately by observing that one should have $$ G''(t,t')+\phi(t)G(t,t')=\delta(t-t') $$ but this cannot be generally true as instead happens that $$ G''(t-t')+\phi(t-t')G(t-t')=\delta(t-t') $$ and the solution should be written in another way. Is there a general approach to cope with a problem like this? 

The problem here is that, with an error that does prove the main results false, a good paper may be forced to restart the review procedure. This will entail some severe delays. So, my suggestion is to wait and then, after the report of the referee, a resubmission of a properly revised version of the paper. 

Algebraic Geometry from a Homotopical Viewpoint: For the topologist who really wants to like geometry but doesn't know where to start. 

Okay so I think the answer is that, yes, you can define such a functor. The main reasons are as follows: 

So it's pretty clear, I think, that this trend doesn't always hold. For example, the intersection of two simply connected subspaces of a space does not have to be simply connected. (For example, the intersection of hemispheres on the sphere is a circle). I think that the reason it holds in all the cases you mention except the case of open sets, is that the property is somehow a "closure" property. Closed sets are closed under limits (or nets, more correctly), subobjects of algebraic objects are closed under some operations, etc. The pervasiveness you see is due to the fact that "closure" type properties behave well under intersection. The open set example, is, I think, a red herring. There, notice that only finite intersections maintain the property in question, and that this behavior with respect to intersections is part of the definition... Probably to avoid having too few open sets. Anyway, I'm not sure what else there is to say about this question- it's rather vague, so I don't even know if this is the kind of answer you wanted. 

I refer to this paper. There is a straightforward approach in this case. You can separate the refraction index in the following way $$ n^2=n_0^2+\xi $$ where $\xi$ is the random part. Then, the equation is $$ \nabla^2U+k^2n_0^2U=-\xi k^2U. $$ Now, turning to the paper I just cited, take the Green function to be ($d=3$ for the sake of simplicity) $$ G(|{\bf r}|) =\frac{e^{ikn_0|{\bf r}|}}{4\pi |{\bf r}|} $$ and the differential equation turns into an integral one $$ U({\bf r}) = U_0({\bf r}) - k^2\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U({\bf r'}). $$ One can iterate this equation and obtain the following solution series $$ U({\bf r}) = U_0({\bf r}) - k^2\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U_0({\bf r'})+k^4\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)\xi({\bf r'})U_0({\bf r'})\times \int d^3x''G(|{\bf r'}-{\bf r''}|)\xi({\bf r''})U_0({\bf r''})+\ldots. $$ By averaging on the distribution for $\xi$, a normal one by hypothesis, one gets a solution series in terms of the correlation function of the random variable. A simple case is this $$ \langle\xi({\bf r})\rangle =0 \qquad \langle\xi({\bf r})\xi({\bf r'})\rangle=\xi_0^2\delta^3({\bf r}-{\bf r'}) $$ yielding $$ U({\bf r}) \stackrel{?}{=} U_0({\bf r})+k^4\xi_0^2G(0)\int d^3x'G(|{\bf r}-{\bf r'}|)U_0^2({\bf r'})+\ldots. $$ that is not well defined mathematically. You can consider a case with a finite volume and recover from this situation. 

As far as I can tell, the idea to use filtered categories instead of just ordinal-indexed diagrams is due to Grothendieck. In fact, let me use this opportunity to advertise my favorite text on abstract category theory: Expos√© I of SGA 4. It rocks. Anyway: Proposition 8.1.6 (loc. cit.), which Grothendieck attributes to Deligne, says that every filtered category receives a cofinal map from an ordered set. Grothendieck remarks that, while this result says that the two points of view on filtered objects (general or ordered) are essentially equivalent, filtered objects arise more naturally. A nice example is Grothendieck's Theorem 8.3.3 on ind-representability. Aside from some set-theoretic issues, this basically boils down to the statement that exactness of a presheaf of sets $F$ on a category $C$ is equivalent to the category $C_{/F}$ being filtered. 

Let $\pi: X \rightarrow Y$ be a 2-fold branched cover of complex varieties. I know of (at least) two types of pushforwards associated to this situation: 

We all know that the ring of germs of continuous functions at a point on, say $\mathbb{R}$, has a unique maximal ideal- namely, those functions that vanish at that point. Can anyone think of a single other example of a prime ideal? We know that there have to be lots and lots of them, since there are no non-zero nilpotent elements in the ring. You can't try and construct such a thing by looking at the germ of functions that vanish at some bigger set of points, because then you can use bump functions to produce two germs whose product is in the ideal but neither of whom belong to the ideal themselves. The only other possible things we could think of would only have a hope of working if we were dealing with smooth functions (though we still haven't come up with an example there!). Is it even possible to write down an example of such a thing for continuous functions, or are they just too ugly? 

The condition on $g$ gives a definite pde for $A$. This can be seen in the following way. Let us insert the solution $f=A(x,y)e^{ig(x,y)}$ into the Helmholtz equation. We get $$ \Delta A+2i(\partial_xg\partial_xA+\partial_yg\partial_yA)+\Phi(x,y)A=0 $$ being $$ \Phi(x,y)=i\Delta g-(\partial_xg)^2-(\partial_yg)^2+a. $$ Now, assuiming $L$ is a linear operator with the Green function $LG=\delta$, one can write $$ g(x,y)=g_0(x,y)+\int_\Omega dx'dy'G(x,x';y,y')h(x',y') $$ being $Lg_0=0$. By substituting this into $\Phi$ and the equation for $A$ we get a partial differential equation to solve. For some operator $L$, the final equation could be simple to manage but, for the general case, maybe some approximation techniques could help. 

Here is the answer by Alexander Dynin to the preceding criticisms that I post on his behalf. I cannot post it as a comment being too long. A point of view from mathematicians would be helpful at this point. 

This is a stochastic differential system of equations. I think this can help. You can also check the full syllabus of the course here with the proper references and other material to download. 

Let us consider the sum $$ m_N(x)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{cN}{2}-i(2c-1)\right). $$ The first step to get an asymptotic approximation is to extract the leading term in $N$ to obtain $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right). $$ When $N$ is finite, we recognize a Riemann series and apply the average theorem. So, there exists a value of argument of the logarithm such that $$ m_N(x)=[f(x)]\log N+[f(x)]\log[z(x)]. $$ We can take $z(x)=\frac{c}{2}-t\[f(x)\](2c-1)$ being $t\in (0,1)$. Indeed, we can define a partition with $x_i=x_{i-1}+\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$ and so $$ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-\frac{i}{N}(2c-1)\right)=[f(x)]\Delta x\sum_{i=0}^{[f(x)]N}\log\left(\frac{c}{2}-i\[f(x)\](2c-1)\Delta x\right) $$ being $\Delta x=\frac{1}{\[f(x)\]N}$. But this, in the given limit, is nothing else than $$ \int_{\frac{c}{2}}^{\frac{c}{2}-\[f(x)\](2c-1)}\log(z)dz<\infty $$ as it should. 

The category of chain complexes on a Grothendieck abelian category can be given the structure of a stable model category in which the weak equivalences are the quasi-isos. The category of chain complexes of $\mathcal{O}$-modules on any ringed space admits a symmetric monoidal model structure, which means that the unbounded derived category is at the very least a tensor-triangulated category (it's not immediately obvious that the tensor structure plays nice with the triangular structure, but it would be very strange to me if this wasn't true or obvious to someone else?) 

Though I don't know of an example off-hand, I don't believe it's the case that every cellular model category presents a presentable $\infty$-category. In practice, we can usually find a combinatorial model for the homotopy theory we're interested in. On the other hand, I think it is true that if you start with a left proper, simplicial, cellular model category and localize, then you will get a localization of the corresponding $\infty$-categories. This is because of Proposition 5.2.4.6 in Higher Topos Theory, which says that a nice adjunction between simplicial model categories gives rise to an adjunction between $\infty$-categories. You can probably remove the requirement that the model categories are simplicial if you work a bit harder. 

There are two different views about the semiclassical limit in quantum mechanics, the first is based on a somewhat shaky ground due to the fact that the existence of the Feynman integral is not proved yet. On the other side, Wiener integral, its imaginary time counterpart does exist and one could pretend to work things out from this and then move to the Feynman integral. The other approach relies on substantial mathematical theorems due to Elliott Lieb and Barry Simon in the '70 and is essentially valid for many-body physics. These latter results make the limit $\hbar\rightarrow 0$ and $N\rightarrow\infty$ equivalent while the former is not really a physical limit due to the fact that Planck constant is never zero. Starting from Feynman path integral, the standard formulation applies to a mechanial problem described from a Lagrangian $L$, normally $L=\frac{\dot x^2}{2}-V(x)$ but one can extend this to more general cases, and then the postulate is that, given a path $x(t)$, this must contribute to the full quantum mechanical amplitude of a particle going from the point $x_a$ to $x_b$ with a term $e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}S}$ being $S=\int_{t_a}^{t_b}dtL(\dot x,x,t)$ the action. All the possible paths contribute and so, the full amplitude will be given by the formal writing $$ A(x_a,x_b)\sim\int[dx(t)]e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_a}^{t_b}dtL(\dot x,x,t)}. $$ Be warned that this integral is not proved to exist yet, but the Wiener counterpart, that can be obtained changing $t\rightarrow it$, exists and describes Brownian motion. Now, if you take the formal limit $\hbar\rightarrow 0$ to this integral you will immediately recognize the conditions to apply the stationary phase method to it. This implies that the functional must have an extremum and this can be obtained by pretending that $$ \delta S=\delta \int_{t_a}^{t_b}dtL(\dot x,x,t)=0 $$ that is, the paths that give the greatest contribution are the classical ones and one recover the classical limit as a variational principle as learned from standard textbooks. While this is a quite common approach, to extend what really happens to a macroscopic system that we can see to respect all the laws of classical mechanics, we have to turn our attention to the limit of a large number of particles $N\rightarrow\infty$. In this case one has more rigorous results. These are due to Lieb and Simon as already said above. They published two papers about Lieb E. H. and Simon B. 1973 Phys. Rev. Lett. 31, 681. Lieb E. H. and Simon B. 1977 Adv. in Math. 23, 22. In the first paper, their theorem 4 states Theorem: For $\lambda < Z$, let $E_N^0$ and $\rho_N^0(x)$ denote the ground-state energy and one-electron distribution function for N spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ electrons obeying the Pauli principle and interacting with $k$ nuclei as described above. Then (a) $N^{-\frac{7}{3}}E_N^0\rightarrow E_1$, as $N\rightarrow\infty$; (b) $N^{-2}\rho_N^0(N^{-\frac{1}{3}}x)\rightarrow\rho_1(x)$ as $N\rightarrow\infty$, where convergence in (b) means that for any domain $D\subset R^3$, the expected fraction of electrons in $N^{-\frac{1}{3}}D$ approaches $\int_D\rho_1 (x)d^3x$. Where $\rho_1(x)$ and $E_1$ refer to the Thomas-Fermi distribution and the corresponding energy. This theorem states that the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$ for a quantum system, under some mild conditions, is the Thomas-Fermi distribution. A system with this distribution is a classical system. The fact that a system with a Thomas-Fermi distribution is a classical one can be seen through the following two references: W. Thirring(Ed.), The Stability of Matter: From Atoms to Stars - Selecta of E. Lieb, Springer-Verlag (1997). L. H√∂rmander, Comm. Pure. Appl. Math. 32, 359 (1979). The second paper just gives the mathematical support to derive Thomas-Fermi approximation as the leading order of a classical expansion for $\hbar\rightarrow 0$ that I will not present here. 

Say you've got a surjective smooth submersion $\widetilde{M} \rightarrow M$ that's also a (smooth?) fiber bundle. (Assume all the manifolds are compact... though I wish there were some weaker condition than that for the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to apply. It'd be nice if one could make sense of it whenever the manifold had finitely generated cohomology). EDIT: See update below. Slap Riemannian metrics on $\widetilde{M}$ and $M$ so that the submersion is a Riemannian submersion. (I just feel like one would need this in step 4. The other thing that would make sense is if we could somehow put a Riemannian metric on $\widetilde{M}$ that would be the 'twisted product' of Riemannian metrics on $F$ and $M$- whatever that means). By the Generalized Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, $\int_{\widetilde{M}}Pf(\Omega_{\widetilde{M}}) = (2\pi)^n \chi(\widetilde{M})$. And here's the thing that seems the hardest to make rigorous (though who knows, I may have already been wrong at step 2): I want to say that $\int_{\widetilde{M}}Pf(\Omega_{\widetilde{M}}) = \int_M\int_F Pf(\Omega_F)Pf(\Omega_M) = (2\pi)^k(2\pi^{n-k})\chi(F)\chi(M)$. 

Since you started with the quasi-categorical version of the twisted arrow category (and not the complete Segal space version), maybe $\Theta_2$ isn't quite the next step. Instead, let's see what happens if we keep things as close to simplicial sets as we can- say, the complicial route a la Verity. For $n=2$ it's possible to make due with less, and we have Lurie's model of $(\infty,2)$-categories via special types of scaled simplicial sets, i.e. a simplicial set $S$ together with a collection $T \subset S_2$ of thin 2-simplices (which we think of as being 'the invertible 2-morphisms') that contain all the degenerate 2-simplices. If $\mathcal{C}$ is an $(\infty,2)$-category, we expect the `hom'-functor to be some type of thing like $\mathcal{C}^{op} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathsf{Cat}_{\infty}$ where the target is the $(\infty,2)$-category of $\infty$-categories. I claim that the appropriate candidate for the twisted arrow category is... the twisted arrow category (again)! Let me say what I mean more precisely. Given a scaled simplicial set $(S, T)$ form the marked simplicial set $(\mathsf{TwArr}(S), M)$ where $\mathsf{TwArr}(S)_n = S([n]^{op} \star [n])$ and a 1-simplex is marked if and only if the two 2-simplices making up the face of the square are thin. This thing has a projection map to $S^{op} \times S$. I claim that when $S$ is fibrant (i.e. an $(\infty,2)$-category) this is an appropriate sort of fibration which is classified by the lax functor $\mathrm{Map}(-,-): S^{op} \times S \to \mathsf{Cat}_{\infty}$ mentioned above. I'll try to sketch how that goes. But first, as a sanity check, notice that the fiber above vertices $(X,Y)$ has 0-simplices given by 1-morphisms $X \to Y$ and $1$-simplices given by a little square. Collapsing the edges $(X=X)$ and $(Y=Y)$ leaves you with a little disk with a line through the middle- all arrows oriented left to right. Keeping track of orientations of the 2-simplices tells you that the two 2-arrows glue together to gives a 2-arrow from the bottom to the top (or top to bottom depending on how you drew this.) This 2-morphism need not be thin, so we are seeing the 'category of 2-morphisms'. Not rigorous, but a little reassuring. 

I think your formula is not correct. The right kernel is invariant by interchanging $x$ with $y$. This symmetry must be preserved. Then, note that $$ L=-\Delta+ax^2+bx=-\Delta+a\left(x+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}\right)^2-\frac{b^2}{4a} $$ and this operator is invariant for translations. This means that the kernel for $b\ne 0$ can be obtained from the kernel for $b=0$ by translation of a shift $\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}$ and multiplying for the overall factor $e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}$. Once this is observed, we can consider the kernel for $b=0$, just the argument of the exponential, to be $$ S_0(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[(x^2+y^2)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t-\frac{xy}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right] $$ and apply the above translation to get $$ S(x,y;t)=\sqrt{a}\left[\left(x^2+y^2+(x+y)\frac{b}{\sqrt{a}}+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\coth 2\sqrt{a}t\right. $$ $$ \left.-\frac{1}{2\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\left(xy+\frac{b}{2\sqrt{a}}(x+y)+\frac{b^2}{4a}\right)\right] $$ and this gives the right kernel $$ K(x,y;t)=\left(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{2\pi\sinh 2\sqrt{a}t}\right)^\frac{1}{2}e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}t}e^{-S(x,y;t)}. $$ 

In order to iterate, you have to substitute the second equation into the first one. So, $$ n_{11}(x,z)=1+\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1)n_{11}(y_1,z). $$ This equation is generally the starting pointing for an iterative procedure, the main tool of perturbation techniques. E.g., you can choose for the first iterate $n_{11}(x,z)=1$ and you will get $$ n_{11}(x,z)=1+\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1) $$ $$ +\int_{-\infty}^xdye^{-izy}u(y)\int_{-\infty}^ydy_1e^{izy_1}{\bar u}(y_1)\int_{-\infty}^{y_1}dy_2e^{-izy_2}u(y_2)\int_{-\infty}^{y_2}dy_3e^{izy_3}{\bar u}(y_3)+\ldots. $$ You can stop the procedure at any desired order to get an approximation to the solution of the integral equations. Then, you put this approximation to $n_{11}$ back into the equation for $n_{12}$ and you will get an approximate solution for it at the given order. 

An easy spectral sequence argument tells us that the natural map induces an isomorphism for every generalized cohomology theory... so that deals with everything modulo fundamental groups. In general maybe you have to ask for the degeneracies to be cofibrations, then this might follow from a model structure argument (the geometric realization would be a hocolim.) (The spectral sequence mentioned above is in, for example, Segal's paper "Classifying Spaces and Spectral Sequences.") 

I really have no idea how to go about doing this... could one use Lie algebra cohomology? I can only seem to find a link between Lie algebra cohomology and deRham cohomology of Lie groups, which is of no help when asking questions of torsion. Maybe there's an integral version? 

Algebraic topologists like to cook up algebraic invariants on topological spaces in order to answer questions, so they are often concerned with how strong those invariants are. Currently, I am concerned with just how much information is lost when moving from a space to `the' chain complex associated to that space. Now, I should be a bit more specific here. There are many homology theories in which one takes a space, cooks up a chain complex, and takes its homology. I am mainly interested in just singular homology for this question, but if you can only think of an answer using sheaf cohomology or some other homology theory then that's alright. Now, the actual question is: 

I am currently working on complex networks. I consider a matrix $\cal N$ with random entries $\delta_{ik}$. These entries are varying randomly in time and so I have a sequence of random matrices that determines a stochastic process. My question is quite simple: Does it exist a generalization of standard stochastic differential equations to random matrices like the case I am considering? Also relevant references are a good answer. Thanks beforehand. 

The simplest approach one can think is an iterative one. Let us consider the given equation $$ f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xG(x,y)f(y)f(x-y)dy. $$ Now, we assume as a first iterate $f^{(0)}(x)=1$ and so $$ f^{(1)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xdyG(x,y) $$ $$ f^{(2)}(x)=\int_{-\infty}^xdyG(x,y)\int_{-\infty}^ydwG(y,w)\int_{-\infty}^{x-y}dzG(x-y,z) $$ and so on. One is granted the existence of the n-th iterate provided the integral of $G$ exists and is properly bounded. 

There is no change into the probability distribution due to the absolute value. The reason can be traced back on the Ito's lemma applied to the derivation of the (Fokker-Planck) equation for the probability distribution: This will depend on $\sigma^2$. 

This is a typical problem of special relativity. The next best choice is a constant acceleration $a$ providing $V(x)=ax$. This has the well-known solution $$x = d+ \frac{1}{a}\sqrt{1+ a^2 t^2}$$ being $d$ a constant, that is unbounded as required.
