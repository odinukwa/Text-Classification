Given a Cobb-Douglas production function your cost function will be cubic exactly if $\alpha + \beta = \frac{1}{3}$, and in this case you will have $a = b = c = 0$. There is no going around this. If you want to have the kind of cost function you describe you will have to slightly alter your Cobb-Douglas function, e.g. $$ f(k,l) = (k-1)^{\alpha} \cdot (l-2)^{\frac{1}{3} - \alpha}. $$ 

Other answers took the game theoretic approach, I will take the utility approach. Adding a real number $d_i$ to all payoffs of a player is an affine transformation of said payoffs. This does not change the player's preferences even when dealing with expected payoffs. Thus the desirability of outcomes is unchanged from the player's perspective hence best responses remain the same. 

Without further information about the market structure this phraseology is unclear and therefore its use is incorrect. An example: Suppose the supply side of this market is provided by a state run company. The company does not care about profit but does care about social optimum, hence they operate at the level where marginal cost is equal to the market price. Of course the government needs funds for other projects. (For public goods where the free market would not reach an optimal allocation.) Thus it levies a tax on other goods, also on the one in our example. This shifts the supply curve upward. Is the welfare maximizing state company really 'pushing the tax onto the consumers'? I would say no. The market mechanism was changed and the new equilibrium allocation is different. Yes, consumer prices are higher in the taxed equilibrium if we compare the two. Perhaps you find this example contrived. Another objection I would raise against the phrase is that in case of perfect competition companies have no price setting power at all, they are price takers. How is it then possible for them to push taxes? Again, I think the market mechanism is changed, and this changes the equilibrium price and quantity. In almost all cases this phraseology is unclear and therefore its use is incorrect. 

The utility function $U'$ is a monotonic transformation of $U$ if there is a strictly monotonically increasing function $f$ for which $$ \forall x,y: \ f(U(x,y)) = U'(x,y) $$ Larger values of $U(x,y)$ should always get larger values assigned. But with the function you outlined this is not the case if $U(x_1,y_1) \leq U(x_2,y_2)$ and $$ \frac{U(x_2,y_2)}{U(x_1,y_1)} \leq \frac{x_1}{x_2}. $$ Basically the order between bundles $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ may change depending on the ratio of their original utilities and the ratio of $x_1$ and $x_2$. An example has been provided by @Oliv. 

Let the set of alternatives be $A = \left\{a_1,a_2,...,a_k\right\}$. Let the number of players be $n$. Let the set of preference orderings over $A$ be $\mathcal{P}$. Then the set of preference profiles is the Cartesian product $$ \mathcal{P}^n = \times_{i=1}^{n} \mathcal{P}. $$ Let us denote the preference ordering $$ a_1 \succ a_2 \succ ... \succ a_k $$ by $p^*$. Define the Social Choice Function $F$ by $$ \forall p \in \mathcal{P}^n: F(p) = p^*. $$ This SCF $F$ clearly has universal domain, is not a dictatorship, and is also independent of irrelevant alternatives. (Or any alternatives for that matter.) 

You seem to be confusing the concepts of value and money. There are ways of repaying a debt without having any money. I.e. you can pay with assets, such as a painting or your house, etc. as long as the other side accepts. The speed of value creation and the speed of money creation need not coincide. When a new painting (or company or diamond) is valued at a million dollars, no bank needs to issue new debt. 

Perhaps you are confusing two things. If $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ denote the production of goods 1 and 2 in a single country and you are in the space defined by them given $L_1 + L_2 = L$ then it is indeed the inferior set (the production possiblity set defined by the feasible $(Q_1,Q_2)$ pairs) that is convex. Formally this means that for all feasible $L_1,L_2,L_1',L_2'$ labor allocations you have \begin{eqnarray*} \mu \cdot Q_1(L_1) + (1-\mu) \cdot Q_1(L_1') & \leq & Q_1(\mu \cdot L_1 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_1') \\ \\ \mu \cdot Q_2(L_2) + (1-\mu) \cdot Q_2(L_2') & \leq & Q_2(\mu \cdot L_2 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_2'). \end{eqnarray*} As this is equivalent to saying $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are concave this is true given the condition that you describe. In this situation the function $Q_1 + Q_2$ has no meaning at all. What are we adding up? Ducks and cars? What will be the unit of measurement here? But if $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ represent the production of a single good in countries 1 and 2 given the amount of labor allocated and the space is $L_1, L_2$, the curves being levels of $Q_w$, then it is the upper level curves that are convex. You can see this straight away because the marginal products of $L_1$ and $L_2$ are decreasing hence their rate of teachnical substitution is 'decreasing' as well. Formally: By definition the function $Q_w(L_1,L_2)$ is concave if for all $L_1,L_2,L_1',L_2'$ and for all $\mu \in [0,1]:$ \begin{eqnarray*} \mu \cdot Q_w(L_1,L_2) + (1-\mu) \cdot Q_w(L_1',L_2') & \leq & Q_w(\mu \cdot L_1 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_1',\mu \cdot L_2 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_2'). \end{eqnarray*} We know that the functions $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are concave, meaning \begin{eqnarray*} \mu \cdot Q_1(L_1) + (1-\mu) \cdot Q_1(L_1') & \leq & Q_1(\mu \cdot L_1 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_1') \\ \\ \mu \cdot Q_2(L_2) + (1-\mu) \cdot Q_2(L_2') & \leq & Q_2(\mu \cdot L_2 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_2'). \end{eqnarray*} Adding these up we get \begin{eqnarray*} \mu \cdot \left(Q_1(L_1) + Q_2(L_2)\right) + (1-\mu) \cdot \left(Q_1(L_1') + Q_2(L_2')\right) \leq \\ \leq Q_1(\mu \cdot L_1 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_1') + Q_2(\mu \cdot L_2 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_2'). \end{eqnarray*} And since $$ Q_w(L_1,L_2) = Q_1(L_1) + Q_2(L_2) $$ we have \begin{eqnarray*} \mu \cdot \left(Q_1(L_1) + Q_2(L_2)\right) + (1-\mu) \cdot \left(Q_1(L_1') + Q_2(L_2')\right) \leq \\ \leq Q_1(\mu \cdot L_1 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_1') + Q_2(\mu \cdot L_2 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_2') \\ \\ \mu \cdot \left(Q_w(L_1,L_2)\right) + (1-\mu) \cdot \left(Q_w(L_1',L_2')\right) \leq \\ \leq Q_w(\mu \cdot L_1 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_1',\mu \cdot L_2 + (1- \mu) \cdot L_2'). \end{eqnarray*} which is what we set out to prove. 

The solutions of UMP and EMP only coincide if certain conditions such as monotonicity of preferences is met. Hence they are different problems. Duality is important because the Lagrangian multipliers frequently have an economic meaning. In the UMP the Lagrangian multiplier of the budget constraint is equal to the marginal utility of money. In the EMP the Lagrangian multiplier of the budget constraint is equal to the marginal cost of utility. In the EMP you can easily replace the consumer with a corporation deciding what inputs to use to create an output. In this case the Lagrangian multiplier would show the marginal cost of output. In a similar way you could also alter the UMP to a problem where a corporation has to decide between some kinds of outputs and is trying to allocate resources in a way that will maximize profits. (E.g.: There are $m$ amount of man-hours and several kind of projects that can be taken on.) 

When the share price has fallen 90% from some price P, the current price is P $\cdot$ 10%. When it has fallen 95% from some price P, the current price is P $\cdot$ 5%.. P $\cdot$ 5% is half of P $\cdot$ 10%. As the share price falls from P, it will first pass through P $\cdot$ 10% before reaching P $\cdot$ 5%. So if we obsere the time period from when the price was P until it was P $\cdot$ 5%, it has hallen 95%. But if we observe the time period from when the price was P $\cdot$ 10% until it was P $\cdot$ 5% the share price has fallen by half. 

Doubtless there are some who embrace the example without knowing much about the subject. (Another frequently retold but incorrect example is potatoes as Giffen goods during the Irish Potato Famine.) 

Yes. Why not? This is exactly what the core is. I would not call it solving, because usually you do not get a unique solution, and in extreme cases you may get no solution. But yes, every economy ($n$ players, $m$ goods) has a core, and it is defined in this way. (As indicated, unless some conditions are met the core may be empty. A competitive equilibrium is always an element of the core, so if that exists, the core is non-empty.) 

There is no conflict. The strategy is a function which maps decision points to actions, that is it tells the player in each decision point (to be precise, in each information set) what she should do. In a dynamic game there are usually more decisions points, so this function nature of the strategy is more obvious. In the simultaneous game you describe there is only one decision point (information set), players have to make a choice at the start of the game. A strategy maps an action to this one decision point (information set), so basically the strategy space is just the action space. EDIT: You write " it would be natural for me to define a strategy as a function: $$s_i: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}."$$ There is some murkiness here, because what is the first $\mathbb{R}$ supposed to be? The strategy set of the other player? But that is not observed by player $i$, so it cannot factor into her decision. As a function the strategy would look actually look like $$s_i: \left\{I_i\right\} \to \mathbb{R},$$ where $I_i$ is the single information set of player $i$, so $\left\{I_i\right\}$ is a singleton set. There is a bijective mapping between the vector space of these strategies and the space $\mathbb{R}$ so it does no harm to define $S_i$ as equal to $\mathbb{R}$. 

Have you tried Google? By copying a part of your question into Google I was able to find several examples. The best one may be this site which lists 20 positively and negatively correlated stocks for any stock you pick: $URL$ 

Caliendo et al. (2009) The Conclusions section of the paper lists several other research papers with slightly different conclusions, you may also want to read those. 

The concept of evolutionary game theory has been around for about forty years. The mathematical details are worked out quite well. Yet this discipline is usually a side note in game theory classes and is seldom applied in economics research. Have there been any papers in this field that are considered influential in economics? To clarify: There are a lot of papers about the connection of game theory and evolutionary game theory, but only a few that seek to apply evolutionary game theory to explain some economic phenomenon. I know of this paper by Vega-Redondo and this paper by Schaffer. 

As you note in your question the (inner points of the) Pareto set are defined by $$ x_1^1 = \frac{\alpha_1 r^1 x_1^2}{\alpha_1 x_1^2 - \alpha_2 x_1^2 + \alpha_2 r^2} $$ In order to better examine this curve, let us treat it as a function. Let $$ f(x) = \frac{\alpha_1 r^1 x}{\alpha_1 x - \alpha_2 x + \alpha_2 r^2}. $$ As I stated in my comment $$ f(0) = 0 \mbox{ and } f(r^2) = r^1, $$ so the set indeed goes from one corner to the other. In between you have $$ \frac{d \ f(x)}{d x} = \frac{\alpha_1\alpha_2r^1r^2}{\left(\alpha_1 x - \alpha_2 x + \alpha_2 r^2\right)^2} $$ and $$ \frac{d^2 f(x)}{dx^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{(\alpha_1\alpha_2r^1r^2) \cdot (\alpha_2-\alpha_1)}{\left(\alpha_1 x - \alpha_2 x + \alpha_2 r^2\right)^3}. $$ The first derivative is always positive because $r^2 > x$ and all other parameters are positive. For the same reason, the sign of the second derivative depends on the sign of $\alpha_2-\alpha_1$. Thus the Pareto set will be a strictly increasing curve, which is convex if agent 2 values good 1 'relatively more', concave if agent 1 values good 1 'relatively more', and a straight line if they value it 'relatively equally'. 

You mean 26 pay dates per year, right? Then no, because a year is 365 days long and a 26 biweeks are $26 \cdot 14 = 364$ days long. Therefore any year that starts with a Friday (which is usually a pay date) should have 27 pay dates. However if Jan 1 is a holiday (depends on where you live), the paydate is probably moved to Dec 31 so the preceding year would have 27 pay dates. 

The assumptions are different. First one states that if a bundle is better than the optimal one the consumer cannot afford it. The second one states that if a bundle is as good (not necessarily better) than the optimal one it has to cost as least as much, not less. Consider a space with just one type of good, $x$, and a utility function $U(x) = 0$. Let the endowment of the consumer be $w = 1$. While $$ \text{if } x_i \succ x_i^* \text{ then } p_ix_i > p_i w_i $$ is still true, $$ \text{if } x_i \succeq x_i^* \text{ then } p_ix_i \geq p_i w_i $$ isn't, because $x^* = 0$ is both optimal and feasible, thus $$ x^* \succeq x^* \text{ AND } p x^* < p w. $$ More complicated examples (multiple goods, global non-satiation fulfilled) may also be constructed. 

I am not sure what you mean by 'free-trade economies', but yes, most countries/trade areas championing the free market do impose all sorts of tariffs. You can read about it on the World Trade Organizations homepage. $URL$ As you pointed out there are all sorts of other tools such as defining specifications for a product that foreign rivals would find difficult to meet in the short term. I would argue that this is frequently difficult to spot as it usually takes the guise of environmental or consumer protection. 

Unfortunately this equation system would still imply \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{3 \cdot 20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & \leq & -10 \end{eqnarray*} which has no solution in non-negative prices. On the other hand, for $p_1 = 0$ you would have \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{30p_1}{p_1+p_2} + \frac{20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & \leq & 30 \\ \\ \frac{30p_1}{p_1+p_2} + \frac{4 \cdot 20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & = & 20. \end{eqnarray*} which implies \begin{eqnarray*} \frac{3 \cdot 20p_2}{p_1+4p_2} & \geq & -10. \end{eqnarray*} As $p_1 = 0$ any positive $p_2$ is a solution for this. 

Discrete distributions have no pdf. And since $r(v)$ is defined via $f(v)$ virtual valuations also do not exist in this case. Even if one were to approximate the discrete distribution $X$ with continuous distributions $X_n$ in such a manner that $$ \forall v: \lim_{n \to \infty} F_n(v) = F(v), $$ the limit $\lim_{n \to \infty} r_n(v)$ would not exist where $\lim_{n \to \infty} f_n(v) = 0$. 

The monopolist is allowed to set the price. However, because his product has a perfect substitute, he can sell 0 products at prices $p>2$. He also has no incentive seting the price $p<2$, because the consumers will buy any number of products he wishes to sell at $p = 2$. This means that $p(q) = 2$. Its graph in the $(q,p)$ coordinate system would be a horizontal line at $p = 2$. Because of this, $p'(q) = 0$. Correcting for this you should be able to easily finish the exercise. 

Basically you want to calculate $$ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_t \cdot d^t $$ where $d$ is the discount factor and where the value paid yearly increases linearly, that is $$ a_t = a_0 + b \cdot t. $$ With some rearrangements $$ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_t \cdot d^t = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_0 \cdot d^t + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} b \cdot t \cdot d^t. $$ The first half of this is a simple geometric sequence like the present value of a perpetuity, so $$ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_0 \cdot d^t = \frac{a_0}{1-d}. $$ To calculate the other sum we'll use a trick. $$ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} b \cdot t \cdot d^t = b \cdot \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t \cdot d^t. $$ Then write \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t\cdot d^{t} & = & d + 2\cdot d^2 + 3\cdot d^3 + 4\cdot d^4 + ... \end{eqnarray*} You can rearrange this (because of absolute convergence) to \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t\cdot d^{t} & = & d + 1\cdot d^2 + 1\cdot d^3 + 1\cdot d^4 + ... \\ \\ & & \hskip 11pt + 1\cdot d^2 + 1\cdot d^3 + 1\cdot d^4 + ...\\ \\ & & \hskip 45pt + 1\cdot d^3 + 1\cdot d^4 + ... \\ \\ & & ... \end{eqnarray*} Every line in this is a geometric sequence, so \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t\cdot d^{t} & = & \hskip 7pt \frac{d}{1-d} \\ \\ & & + \frac{d^2}{1-d} \\ \\ & & + \frac{d^3}{1-d} \\ \\ & & ... \end{eqnarray*} Which is again a geometric sequence, thus \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} t\cdot d^{t} & = & \frac{d}{(1-d)^2}. \end{eqnarray*} So $$ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_t \cdot d^t = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} a_0 \cdot d^t + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} b \cdot t \cdot d^t = \frac{a_0}{1-d} + \frac{b \cdot d}{(1-d)^2}. $$
