Warren Moors and Julia Novak in a paper entitled "Order matters when choosing sets" proved that if 1 < w < t < v are integers then $${{{v}\choose {w}}\choose {t}} > {{{v}\choose {t}}\choose {w}}.$$ In words: the number of t-subsets from the family of w-subsets of [v]={1,2,...,v} is larger than the number of w-subsets from the family of t-subsets of [v]. The question (proposed by Steve Wilson in a problem session of this conference) 

Let $\cal T_n$ be the family of all triangulations on an $n$-gon using $(n-3)$ non-intersecting diagonals. The number of triangulations in $\cal T_n$ is $C_{n-2}$ the $(n-2)$th Catalan number. Let $\cal S \subset \cal T_n$ be a subfamily of triangulations with the property that every two triangulations of $\cal S$ have a common diagonal. 

There are some rather obvious aspects to the question that perhaps should be mentioned. "For a large number of readers, the choice whether they select to read a paper or not is often strongly influenced by the title." Yes, but it is also strongly influenced by the abstract and introduction. "I was wondering if the MO-users would be willing to share their wisdom with me on what makes the title of a paper memorable for them; or perhaps just cite an example of title they find memorable?" Since most answers refereed to the second part, perhaps it is worth answering the first part of the question as well. Perhaps the main thing that makes the title (and paper) memorable is the content of the paper. "This advice would be very helpful in helping me (and perhaps others) in designing better, more informative titles (not only for papers, but also for example, for MO questions)." Overall, the reaction in the mathematics community to catchy titles, personal descriptions, jokes of various kind, and various other things that can be seen as PR-related or "salesmenship" are mixed. So while it is always good to have a clear title having an overlly catchy title can also backfire. 

This is an intruiging question. I have some suggestions but I am not sure about them. 1) Frege's work on logic. (Logic was stagnated for many many centuries before.) 2) Conway's surreal numbers. 3) Game theory (e.g. zero sum games). 

There are quite a few examples where simplicial complexes, more general complexes, and algebraic topology in general had important impact on graph theory. (Usually, the applications are indirect and by looking at the graph as a 1-dimensional simplicial complex.) Some such applications are even mentioned in the book you referred to. Examples include: Lovasz solution to the Kneser problem and related later studies of homomorphisms of graphs, the study of simplicial complexes based on edge-sets of graphs with certain properties, the solution of the evasiveness conjecture for graph properties. I will try to gradually find online papers surveying some of these areas. 1) Here is a survey on Kneser's conjecture by Mark de Longueville 2) Lovasz and Young Lecture Notes on Evasiveness of Graph Properties 3) Jakob Jonsson thesis on simplicial complexes of graphs with introduction and many references. 4) Another line of research started with Aharoni and Haxell's "Hall's theorem for hypergraphs‚Äè." For example Meshulam studied in this context the independence complex of a graph, and found connections between homological properties of the complex and combinatorial properties of the graphs. 5) Another brunch of such applications is coming from Lovasz' 1977 proof of a conjecture by Frank on finding k connected subgraphs with presecibed numbers of vertices in a k-connected graph. (Gyori gave a purely combinatorial proof). A chapter entitled Topological methods about applications of algebraic topology in combinatorics by Bjorner is a very good general reference and it contains also material about applications to graph theory. Let me try now to say gradually a few things on each of the five directions mentioned above. 1) Development related to Kneser's conjecture. The chromatic number of a graph is one of the most important parameters associated to graphs. Lovasz' idea was to establish a lower bound on the chromatic number of a graph $G$ in terms of the (homological connectivity) of a simplicial complex - the neighborhood complex, ${\cal N}(G)$ asspciated with $G$. The faces of the neighborhood complex are sets of vertices that have a common neighbors. Lovasz proved that if ${\cal N}(G)$ is $k$-connected (namely has a vanishing reduced homology groups of index $i < k$ then the chromatic number of $G$ is at least $k+2$. (For example if $G$ is bipartite then ${\cal N}(G)$ is disconnected.) These topological methods were extended and applied to various questions related to homomorphisms of graphs. 2) Evasiveness. Consider monotone (decreasing) properties of graphs (say, on a fixed set of $n$ vertices). Here by "monotone" I mean that if a graph $G$ has the property then also every subgraph $H$ of $G$ has the property. (We consider here subgraphs with the full set of vertices.) Every such property describes a simplicial complex whose vertices are the edges of the complete graph on $n$ vertices and whose simplices correspond to subsets of edges so that the subgraph described by them has the property. This simple construction is important also for item 3). We can ask for monotone (and non-monotone) properties of graphs what is the decision-tree complexity of the property. Namely, given an unknown graph $G$ we can ask questions of the type "is an edge $e$ belongs to $G$". We can choose questions according to earlier answers. The evasiveness conjecture of Aanderaa, Karp, and Rosenberg asserts that every non-trivial monotone property of graphs is evasive: namely, you need to ask in the worst case all ${{n} \choose {2}}$ edges before being able to tell if the property is satisfied. Kahn, Saks & Sturtevant proved in 1983 that the conjecture holds when the number of vertices is a prime power. The general case remains open. The basic idea is this: the simplicial complex that corresponds to a non-evasive property must be contractible. (In fact, it is even collapsible in a very strong sense.) On the other hand if the property is non-trivial it admit a free action of the symmetric group on the vertices (acting on the edges). And know you need some basic observations on the symmetric group for prime power number of elements plus a fixed point theorem (by Oliver) for groups of certain types to show that in the prime power case this is impossible. 

Motivation 1 There are two items on the motivation list. The first is why is the problem interesting. Isoperimetric inequalities are quite central in combinatorics and in applications to probability. This specific problem is a sort of "missing lemma" in a work by Jeff Kahn and me about threshold behavior of monotone properties. The problem is related to an appealing conjecture about random graphs. This missing lemma is needed for the following conjecture: 

Graffiti is a computer program which makes conjectures in various subfields of mathematics, particularly graph theory. (And also in chemistry.) It was written by written by Siemion Fajtlowicz. Here is a 1989 article about it. 

$$(1-\lambda_2)/2\le h(G)\le \sqrt{2(1-\lambda_2)},$$ is the "discrete Cheeger-Buser inequality", relating the spectral gap of the discrete laplace operator to the discrete Cheeger constant of a graph. In particular, it gives the spectral characterization of expander families. Here $h(G)$ is the expansion of a graph $G$, and $\lambda_2$ refers to the secpnd smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian of $G$. The inequality on the right is due to Alon-Millman and Tanner. The inequality on the left is by Alon. 

This is an interesting question. (Even if there is no finite list of "axioms".) For example the following is true: Suppose you have a (d+1)-dimensional polytope P. Associate a convex set in $R^d$ to every facet of P, and suppose that every non empty intersection among the facets implies a non empty intersection for the corresponding sets. Then there are some set of facets of the polytope with empty intersection so that the corresponding convex sets have non empty intersection. This is a large collection of statements of the kind you asked that already includes Helly's theorem. Note that the nerve theorem gives you a lot of information on intersection patterns that cannot be realized. (Including the statement made above.) A stronger statement for the case described above goes as follows: Suppose that 0 is in the interior of P. Then you can find two faces of F and G of P so that 0 is in their convex hull and the intersection of all sets corresponding to facets containing F and all sets corresponding to facets containing G is nonempty. This can be derived from the Borsuk-Ulam theorem. Another well known result of the kind you ask about is the colorful Helly theorem (proved by Lovasz and a dual Caratheodory version was proved independently by Barany). It sais that if you have d+1 collections of convex sets in R^d, and if for every choice of one set from each collection there is a point common to all chosen sets then there is a collection all whose members have a point in common. For n=1 there is a theorem by Lekkerkerker and Boland characterizing interval graphs. The characterization is based on two requirements: (1) there are no induced cycles of length >3. (This leaves us with chordal graphs.) (2) for every 3 vertices, one of the vertices is a neighbor of a vertex in every path between the other two. This gives an infinite set of "axioms" in the sense asked in the question. I suppose there is no finite list. So overall there are many interesting theorems of the kind you described, and this is a rich area. But a complete description for dimension > 1 does not look realistic. A more general question is to study the situation where you allow both operation: (1) taking the intersection (2) taking convex hull. This makes the problem even much more complicated and not much is known. An example of a recent result in this more general setting is the following theorem by Novick: Given 7.2k pairwise disjoint convex sets in the plane there is a set in the family that is disjoint to the convex hull of k other sets in the family.
