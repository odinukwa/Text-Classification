This isn't really true. It is just one research paper, and one comment on said research paper. Also, it merely describes the paper, without quoting it. In any case, a major finding of the first paper is that there are discrete metal particles in the mixture. In other words, it is not a true solution. That there are discrete metal particles in the mixture, permits mechanisms whereby the manipulative steps one executes in diluting do not result in a quantitative dilution. For example, if you throw 100 liters of ping-pong balls into a 1,000,000 liter swimming pool filled with water, stir the swimming pool, and skim a sample of material from the top layer of the pool, the volume-fraction of ping pong balls in the sample will differ from the ratio 1:10,000 expected on a basis of the ping-pong balls being randomly distributed in the water, because ping-pong balls float. This is basically what the first two articles mentioned in the OP are finding. The metal particles are concentrated at the surface due to bubbles. If only material from a top layer is used for each round of dilution, the dilution is not quantitative. The final concentration is greater than would be predicted on the basis of what would happen to a true homogeneous solution. Flotation is a long-known technique for concentrating metals such as gold at the surface of a mixture using bubbles. See Froth Flotation: A Century of Innovation. The research cited in the OP is not something that can be generalized to all homeopathic preparations. It only applies to certain homeopathic solutions prepared in certain ways. For example, if material is not taken from near the top of the container, but instead in the central portion of the container, then the final preparation would be at least as dilute as expected. The title question "Do extreme homeopathic dilutions still retain quantities of the starting materials?" is phrased so as to necessarily be false. If it retains a significant amount of starting material, by definition it is not extremely dilute. The articles in the OP simply show that dilution techniques that work for true solutions, such as salt water, do not always work quantitatively for mixtures with solid particles. The above findings are further discussed in Adverse effects and homeopathy: may remedies yet contain noxious or toxic molecules? British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 2014 Jul; 78(1):184-5. The research cited in the OP, together with research such as Effect of alcohol-water exchange and surface scanning on nanobubbles and the attraction between hydrophobic surfaces. J Colloid Interface Science 2008; 325: 267–74 is being accepted as correct and showing the possible risks of metals or other starting materials being unexpectedly present due to failed dilution attempts. 

Overall, there is good evidence that the oldest elongated noodles are from China, but noodles were already know in Europe before Marco Polo. 

The claim in the OP is paraphrasing a historic source. Usher Ferguson Linder wrote, in Reminiscences of the Early Bench and Bar of Illinois (1876):

Kanin was reattributing a pre-existing joke to Einstein. For example in the 1956 National Wholesale Druggists Yearbook, volume 82, quoting entertainment by John Charles Daly 

Contrary to another answer, the 1964 survey was not run by a special interest group. Instead, it was designed by the Survey Research Center, University of California, Berkeley and conducted by the National Opinion Research Center (NORC), University of Chicago. The National Opinion Research Center Fiftieth Anniversary Report 1991 states: 

There is a fragment of truth in the story, barely enough to see where it originates. In 1773 Benjamin Franklin was staying in London. On 22 September 1773 the The Public Advertiser published a hoax letter An Edict by the King of Prussia, written by Franklin. The edict does discuss England being forced to take prisoners, but Prussian, not French. The exact language is: 

Firstly, the northern 55 km of the square is the Oklahoma Panhandle, while the remainder is the Texas Panhandle, which is 270km east to west. The blue square is therefore about 123km on each side, 15,000 sq. km. or 3,700,000 acres. A great resource for evaluating whether this is sufficient is Land-Use Requirements for Solar Power Plants in the United States by the National Renewable Energy Lab. According to table 4 (which considers only direct land use) the most efficient use is by 2-axis concentrating PV systems, which need only 2 acres to produce a GWh per year. So with 3,700,000 acres, 1,850,000 GWh can be produced per year. This compares to 4,686,400 GWh per year in electricity consumption for the USA as of 2013. So, no, even considering the best current technology and only direct land use, it is not a large enough area.

This issue was discussed in the 12/23/2009 New York Times article "South Korea Stretches Standards for Success" The Times cites "Yoon Myoung, a top researcher Consumers Korea" stating: 

So, yes the OP is correct that large numbers of wind turbines decrease the kinetic energy of the wind available, but the OP reference is still overestimating with the 1.0 W m−2 figure. It is another factor of 2 or 3 lower according to this more-recent research. The article also explains there is a peak, not in the sense of using up all the wind, but instead a point beyond which adding more turbines actually decreases the amount of electricity generated: 

It should be kept in mind that this study is done upon women 18-25 who are full time enrolled in college. In other words, there are freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. However, the study finds that it is mostly as freshman and sophomores that college woman are sexually assaulted. Restricting the data to only seniors (who are the only ones approaching a complete college experience): 

Yes. In addition to the 1960 Popular Science article you mention there was a 1923 Popular Science article: TAXI METERS USED IN ROME: 

Yes, there were many fatalities where it was customary to eat uncooked or undercooked pork, at one time. According to the 1908 book The animal parasites of man: a handbook for students and medical men (alternative link): 

Where "Ma" means million years. Additionally, Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over the past 60 million years Nature 406, pp. 695-699 shows CO2 levels of 1000ppm 40 million years ago, 2500ppm 46 million years ago, and consistently above 1800 ppm in the 52-60 million year time period. So, no, the Cretaceous period was not the last time, significantly higher than (more than double) present CO2 levels occurred more recently in the Paleogene period and somewhat higher levels occurred during the Neogene period. A more complete quote of Mann's testimony shows it is reasonably accurate: 

This can even happen naturally as explained in the US National Weather Service article Snow Rollers Observed Across Central Illinois (Spring 2003)

The mistake in the article in the OP is the date, "1963-1964 Cyprus crisis". The problem occurred in 1974 and did relate to a/the Cyprus crisis. According to U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe at page 25: 

Obviously this answer would be too long going through every state, not to mention other jurisdictions, but basically rights vary from state to state. In Tennessee, it does seem that you have the right to exactly one telephone call, while other states give the right to a higher number, unspecified number or "reasonable number", but there is no federal requirement that in every state you have the right to a phone call. Unless you read the state law for a particular state, don't assume you have a right to a phone call. For example, regarding Wyoming, there is discussion on a police officers forum to the effect that there is no right to a phone call in Wyoming: "I checked and according to our county attouney[sic] it is a privaledge[sic] here." The officer also acknowledges not letting a person who requested a telephone call have a telephone call at that time. And regarding Minnesota, attorney Christian Ryan Peterson states: "There is no right to a phone call. Your phone privileges depend on the rules of the jail where you are being held" A Kentucky state government publication states: 

The quote from the Wall Street Journal article is misleading. 80% is not the correct number for "grow up to be not transgender" The Handbook of Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders explains at page 390 that by age 18 only 1 of the 44 was "gender-dysphoric to the extent of considering sexual reassignment surgery". In other words, the handbook explains that by age 18, 98% (43 out of 44) were not transgender and "75% to 80% were homosexual or bisexual". The manual refers to the above study (Green, 1987) as the "most comprehensive long-term follow up" study, but gives data for other studies. It explains that other studies (Zucker and Bradley 1995 and Wallien and Kettenis 2007) found 20% remained gender-dysphoric upon follow-up, but follow-up was not to adulthood (average age 16.5 at follow-up for Zucker and Bradley; "mid-adolescence" for Wallien and Kettenis). 

The quote from Richard Wagner refers to his writing "Erkenne dich selbst [Know Thyself]" in Bayreuther Blatter February-March 1881, and according to the 1897 English translation compellation Richard Wagner's Prose, vol. IV, Religion and Art, the exact quote is:

As of 16 March 2016, no changes to the law have been made in many years. There are two main section in German Law concerning rape/sexual assault, section 177 and 179. There is a bill (proposed law) that primarily concerns changing section 179. Current section 179(1) is: 

So, while I do not agree that Siegel and Pennington actually said "exposure to...computed tomography (CT) and X-ray medical imaging scans does not cause cancer", if somebody did say this, it isn't true.

Yes. In the USA, the current Mother's Day holiday was enacted by a joint resolution of Congress on May 8th, 1914. Prior to being made a federally recognized day, florists did play a role in promoting the idea. In the August 1910 Proceedings of the 26th Convention of the Society of American Florists it is recorded Anna Jarvis's attempt to create Mother's Day "has proven so beneficial to the business" and a unanimous resolution was passed to publicly recognize her efforts. In the 15 May 1913 The Florist Review, volume 32, page 17, there is an article LESSONS OF MOTHERS' DAY:

Two references confirm that Feynman wrote the LASER article, which was titled Mr. Papf's Perpetual-Motion Machine: The 1989 Skeptical Inquire vol. 14, page 46 (which appears to republished the whole article along with another Feynman article). The articles are introduced on page 45: 

Since sanctions were eliminated, Iranian oil production has jumped by about 900,000 barrels per day and exports have increased by over 1 million barrels per day, so it's really a question of how many days (years) it will take for the president's statement to be true. The secretary of Treasury's statement makes it sound like additional revenue would be more than an extra $40 billion per year, but oil prices were much higher in the 2012-2014 time period. 1 million barrels per day at $40 a barrel is only $15 billion per year. So, in summary Iran gained $100-$125 billion on paper by unfreezing assets, but it is not all usable money. And there is additional gain from relief of oil sanctions. 

The OP is misrepresenting current US government (including FDA) policy. The current FDA donor questionnaire asks 

No. At most, wording was merely proposed, but did not pass into law. There are numerous 1913 publications that mention the proposed law. For example, Railway Journal, April 1913, volume 19, page 10: 

Back issues are available for $11.11 if you want to be 100% sure, but it seems like a reasonably well-referenced, but outdated and non-specific, statement. (originally, in his 2003 book, Ramsey said 75%, not 78%, however) Another reference specifies that by "major" Money means "$10,000+" 

"Currently" means 1999-2000 according to the 2004 citing article. As of 30 June 1999 there were 1,860,520 prisoners in the US, so 350,000 would have been 19%. The 2004 article also says: 

Also, a 1974 version of the claim is Proceedings of the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs at page 287: 

The book Our Flag (1872) further explains that in the House, Julian Hartridge introduced an amendment which was passed changing the flag (relative to the Senate bill) to have an all white background, without the blue stripe. (Julian Hartridge practiced law in Savannah and represented Georgia in the House) With foreknowledge of Julian Hartridge's plan, but before the amendment was introduced by Hartridge and with expectation of the House and Senate having approved different flags, Savanna Daily Morning News published another editorial The New Confederate Flag 28 April 1863. This article further expressed the supremacist symbolism of the all-white background flag saying (with all caps in the original text as below):
