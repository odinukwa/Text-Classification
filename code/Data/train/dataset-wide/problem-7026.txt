I am not sure which is your current level of understanding so tailoring the answer seems difficult. At a very basic level, the idea is as follows. Commercial banks and other institutions originate mortgages but have a preference for liquid assets and so they would rather sell them to third parties instead of keeping them in their portfolio until all the money is paid back. Because the market has to be thick, one cannot simply sell 'Fato's mortgage'. One pools together a bunch of mortgages with similar characteristics and then sells 'shares' on this pool. So far so good. The problem becomes more complicated because the optimal structure of these 'shares' is not simple equity. This is because (i) different investors have different preferences for liquidity and (ii) there are information asymmetries in the market. In general, these assets are structured into tranches. The prime tranche offers debt (a fixed payment unless there is default) and uses the first income that the mortgage originates. The last tranche is equity and is the most junior so they only get money if the mortgage is paid in full. In the middle, the mezzanine tranches, are some sort of combination between the two. These assets' returns are completely tied to the mortgages so that if the mortgages fail, some of these assets become junk. Notice also that, in principle, different people buy different tranches and the risk is spread. Furthermore, the bank does no longer have a stake in the mortgage. Securitization had many problems that people failed to foresee, or at any rate, failed to fully understand. First, precisely because the originators no longer had a stake in the game, they did not provide accurate monitoring and screening and the quality of the mortgages dropped (this is accurately captured in the movie). Second, because the assets pooled together similar mortgages, they failed to take into account the full correlation structure of the different mortgages. Third, many investors did not fully understand these complex securities and held extremely long positions on some of the original mortgages, although they had normal positions on each of the assets (e.g. Lehman Bros was extremely long in subprime mortgages although it was not extremely long on any particular asset). As it happened, if a mortgage in Florida for a 200k house for a guy with credit score such and such defaults, it is quite likely that others would do too. This makes the whole castle crumble. So back to the questions you raised at the beginning. First, if you buy the equity tranche of a mortgage (which is ex-ante very attractive) you only get paid at all if a large chunk of the mortgages in the pool are fully repaid. If a significant fraction defaults, then only the top tranches get anything and the rest get paid nothing. So it may be that you only get 5% of what you invested (but if things went well, you would get twice or more). Hope this helps. If you need some further clarification feel free to ask. I can also add some numerical examples and give some more advanced references. Wikipedia has a good set of articles on it too. 

Your errors aren't the same anymore. For example, instead of writing $Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X + U$, you're actually writing $Y = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 X + \alpha_3 X^2 + V$. There is no expectation that they should be the same. In other areas, the trouble is that the error term is likely correlated with your regressors. Fear not: running wages on education is a common specification. Searching for something like 

In addition to BKay's answer, selling expired food opens a firm to suit. This occurs either via breach of an implied warranty (that the food is fit for consumption) or, in many jurisdictions, strict tort. While grocers do carry products liability insurance, the policies require that stores adopt certain standards of practice. It should make sense that refrigeration practices, expiration management, quality control, and the like feature heavily. This enters a profit function through increasing costs. Specifically, the expected payouts line will increase either by upping the average liability payout (in a simple cash flow approach) or modifying the shape of the distribution of payouts (in a theory context). 

Here's a non-technical answer: Bonds are a form of debt. What the issuer is selling is essentially a promise to repay the principal (i.e. whatever price the buyer paid) and some interest to the buyer. (Note: since we're talking about debt, you could also think of the buyer as a lender.) In return, the issuer gets to use the money from the sale for whatever current projects needed funding in the first place. Skirting some technical stuff, assume the yield is the same thing as the interest rate. When lenders think there's a higher risk of not getting their money back, they'll either 1) not lend in the first place, or 2) if they do lend, demand higher a higher interest rate to compensate them for the higher probability of not getting repaid. When someone downgrades your credit, it's a statement about you: they believe you're at a higher risk of not fulfilling your promise to repay the lender. So any lender that does decide to take a risk and loan you money (i.e. buy your bond) is going to be in situation #2 above: they'll demand you pay more interest on the loan (here, higher bond yield) to compensate them for your riskiness. That makes borrowing more expensive for you since you now have to pay a higher interest rate than you would have if you had better credit. Rollovers are a type of reinvestment. At the heart of the matter, credit downgrades happen when lenders lose faith in your ability to fulfill your promises. This happens for a multitude of reasons. As an example, S&P's 2011 downgrade of U.S. debt happened because they believed 1) that the pattern of running deficits most years might eventually put the U.S. at risk of not repaying (that is, the debt-to-GDP ratio might not be sustainable), and 2) that political leaders lacked a credible plan to tackle the problem. 

I don't think there is right or wrong. Here is an example of what could be behind some of these arguments. Let us assume that there are two buyers in the economy: Singer and Foreman. Foreman enjoys meat but he prefers humane meat (other things equal). Let $V$ be the value that Foreman derives from a unit of humane meat and $v$ the value from normal meat. Singer is a consequentialist and has as a goal to reduce the meat consumption. Singer is willing to pay $1\$$ to reduce the total consumption of meat in unit and $\beta\$<1$$ to reduce the total consumption of humane meat. If Singer was alone, he would simply refrain from eating. Because Singer is a consequentialist he does not care who eats the meat (this simplifies the analysis). Now, suppose that there are scale economies in the production of humane meat so that the first unit costs $C$ and the second costs $C'$, while the production of normal meat has constant returns and the marginal cost is $c$. Both markets are competitive. If $V-C<v-c$, then in isolation Foreman would buy normal meat. Singer would have a disutility of $1$. If Singer buys humane meat then Foreman would do so too if $V-C'>v-c$ (which may be possible since $C'<C$). Singer would then have a disutility of $2\beta+C'$ (the price of the meat plus the total disutility of two units). If $2\beta+C'<1$, then Singer judges the world to be better if he buys humane meat and he proceeds to do so. Thus, if activists consider 'humane meat' to be much better than normal meat and there are substantial scale economies in its production, they may prefer to buy it as a way of inducing others to do the same. If they have agent-specific morality (e.g. they prefer a world in which others buy meat than a world in which they buy meat but they have the same world consumption), then participating in the humane meat market may be a less desirable option. Finally, notice that there are other ways in which Singer could improve the world. For instance, he can buy stock in humane meat consumption and swallow the losses that come from selling at a price $p=c+V-v<C$. This gives Singer a disutility of $\beta+(C-c)-(V-v)$ which is lower if $\beta$ is sufficiently high. (For simplicity I assume that Singer does not consider Foreman's consumption of utility as deserving moral praise so he does not include Foreman's extra utility in his computation. If he did, then buying humane meat would be even more desirable.) 

In dynamic programming, the method of undetermined coefficients is sometimes known as "guess and verify." I've periodically heard there are canonical guesses one might make. In particular, I've seen $V(k) = A + B\ln(k)$ $V(k) = \frac{Bk^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}$ The former applies to log utility while the latter is related to CRRA preferences. What other canonical guesses exist, and are these generally tied to the particular form of the return function? Edit: For those not familiar with dynamic programs, what we're trying to do here is come up with closed-forms for the coefficients (e.g. $A$ and $B$). To over-simplify, the functional equation typically takes the generic form $V(k) = \max\bigl\{F(k,u) +\beta V\bigl(g(k,u)\bigr)\bigr\}$, where $g(\cdot,\cdot)$ describes the evolution of the state variable $k$. Essentially, the value of being in state $k$ today depends on today's return function $F(k,u)$ and some discounted value of whatever $k$ is going to be tomorrow $\beta V\bigl(g(k,u)\bigr)$. $u$ represents whatever other non-state variables you think influence the return. Sometimes it's possible to get a closed-form solution for $V(k)$ (...note: we don't just solve for $V(k)$ since the right-hand side is a maximized quantity). This typically involves knowing something about the return function $F(k,u)$ and then making a guess about the functional form of $V(k)$. We can then iterate to see if our guess yields a closed-form solution for $V(k)$. In particular, this would include closed-forms for the coefficients in the guess (hence the method of undetermined coefficients). 

It sounds like you've basically eyeballed the groups to decide they're similar. A more advanced way of eyeballing would be to plot the distribution of each characteristic to see how similar they look. In order to move beyond eyeballing, though, you'd need recourse to statistics. One common method--that comes up frequently in two-group studies--is to do a statistical test to verify that the groups are similar. Broadly speaking, you'd look at each characteristic, say height, and assert your hypothesis: average height is the same in both groups. Then you could do a hypothesis test to see if the average height is actually the same or if it's different. The specific statistical test you'd use depends on the data in your possession. For example, see the t-test or the chi-squared test for a difference in means (or just search for "difference in means test"). You'd run the test (statistical software generally has a feature like this) to determine if it shows a significant difference. If so, you might be comfortable saying the groups are not similar inasmuch as that characteristic (height) is concerned. Then you'd repeat the procedure for weight and each of the other characteristics. At the end, many researchers make a little table that shows the $p$-values (which you get from running the test) for each of the characteristics. This gives your readers the ability to see and decide for themselves whether the groups are similar. 

The easiest way to prove it is using the 'old' definition of continuity. $\succ$ is continuous iff whenever $x\succ y$, there exists neighborhoods of $x$ and $y$, $B_x, B_y$, such that all $z\in B(x)$ and $z'\in B(y)$, $z\succ z'$. Suppose $x\succ y$. Because $u$ represents $\succ$, $u(x)>u(y)$. Let $2\epsilon=u(x)-u(y)$. Because $u$ is continuous, there exists some $\delta>0$ such that for all $z\in B_{\delta}(x)$, $u(z)>u(x)-\epsilon$. Similarly, for all $z'\in B_{\delta}(y)$, $u(z')>u(y)+\epsilon$. But then for all $z\in B_{\delta}(x)$ and $z'\in B_{\delta}(y)$, $z\succ z'$ as required. 

This is a paper using a competitive monopolistic framework (in GE). It is an old paper by Stratz (1989). Recent work with Stone-Geary preferences relates to the issue of structural transformation following the work of Herrendorf, Rogerson and Valentinyi (2013), although there is considerable debate on whether these preferences appropriately capture the data. All these papers have a representative consumer, with expenditure shares changing over time due to growth. 

Prescription drug prices, like those of most other retail products, fail to satisfy the law of one price routinely. The most obvious observation is that prices differ across pharmacies at a given point in time ($URL$ but just like supermarkets give discounts, so do pharmacies. If you always buy from the same shop, you are bound to end up paying different amounts. The reasons for this are manifold. Different consumers have different abilities or willingness to store and buy large chunks when it is cheap and stochastic prices allows for price discrimination (see Sobel 84 for an early reference). The idea is simple. Myopic consumers arrive in each period and buy if $p<V$, then leave the market. Otherwise, they die. Strategic consumers have a valuation of $v<V$ but can wait if the price is above $v$. Firms compete in prices. In equilibrium, firms charge often $p=V$ to extract rents from myopic consumers but every now and then they offer $p<v$ to attract all strategic consumers looking for prices. Competition between stores may also result in random prices in a standard consumer search framework. Finally, retail prices may change because manufacturers prices are also random as a way to discipline pharmacies by encouraging consumers to shop. 

The monopolist solves, $\max \pi=R(Q)-C(Q)=P(Q)Q-C(Q)$ The general solution is (if the problem is globally concave) $MR(Q^*)=P'(Q^*)Q^*+P(Q^*)=C'(Q^*)$. Since $P'(Q)<0$, notice that $MR(Q)<P(Q)$ and, therefore, $Q^*<Q^{C}$. In this example, we have $P(Q)=3-\frac{Q}{16000}$ and $C(Q)=Q$. Hence, $MR(Q)=-\frac{1}{160000}Q+(3-\frac{Q}{16000})=1=MC(Q)$. Rewritting, we get $3-\frac{Q}{8000}=1$ or $Q=16000$. To compute the price simply substitute in the demand function and get $P(16000)=3-1=2>1$.
