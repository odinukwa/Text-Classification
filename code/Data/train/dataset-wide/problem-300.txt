The power emitted by Hawking radiation (see Hawking (1974)) is $$P=\frac{\hbar c^6}{15360\pi G^2M^2}\tag{1}$$ For a black hole of ~1 M$_{\odot}$, that comes out to about 9.00$\times$10-29 watts. We can use this to calculate the effective temperature on a planet orbiting the black hole. If we stuck Earth at 1 AU from this black hole, it would have an effective temperature of about 1 10-55th of its current one (working off of solar luminosities). 

2010 TK7 has quite the odd orbit, moving closer to and farther from Earth over time. It oscillates in a way that takes it far enough away from L4 for it to be practical. The other consideration is that 2010 TK7 has a very high orbital inclination, as illustrated here: 

When building a world, I use one of two approaches: Either figure out the geography or write down the societal history. I can then use the one to influence the other and then move on to the rest of the world. When building a world for the sake of worldbuilding, I like to create the geography of it first and then let the society play out its own history. But when building a world for a story, I have to work on the history leading up to the story, to determine how the society evolved to its current state. Then I figure out the geography I need to let that history play out (for example, maybe I need to have characters live in a city on the slope of a mountain, and so I create a mountain range). While working on one of my current worlds, I determined that a specific city needed to be in or near the foothills of what I've called the Great Western Mountains. That's fine enough; most of the rest of the immediate area in the east is flat and gently starts to become more mountainous, with a couple hills here and there. The issue, though, is that in order for the city's history to develop to where it is in my story, I want to have a great battle take place in a long, grassy plain outside the city - kind of like the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, for all you Tolkien fans. The problem? I can't come up with a good reason for there to be a giant plain in the middle of the foothills of the Great Western Mountains. I'm not willing to change the battle setting, because when last I checked, cavalry charges are not good on forested mountain slopes. This isn't the only time I've had the geography of my world clash with its history. At least one island city has never come to fruition because I determined that the mountain islands it resides on would, in a realistic world, extend north on the mainland in a large mountain range that blocks off a trade route or two. These aren't fantastic examples, but the point is, I've had many cases where I can't have a certain setup and preserve historical and scientific realism. The obvious solution here is to develop the geography and history side by side, integrating each into the other. My reason for not doing so is that I tend to end up with either a world that is scientifically unnatural (e.g. a peninsula that spontaneously juts out from an otherwise flat coastline) or a world with an implausible history (e.g. General Thel has to make a detour along a mountainous ridge that I've had to make instead of engaging the enemy's much smaller force on the valley floor I originally wanted but had to get rid of). Maybe this is just the result of a lack of imagination on my part, and an inability to see solutions to these issues (as well as the terrible examples I've given), but this sometimes becomes a problem I can't solve. So when I'm trying to build a world, and I need event X to happen at location Y, but the two are incompatible, what can I do? How do I build a world that doesn't behave like I want it to? Please note that I'm not asking how to solve the specific examples I gave, but the case in general. 

Well, there's always the old 'execution-by-pushing-a-person-into-outer-space-so-s/he-dies-from-suffocation-and-heating/freezing' approach. You simply calculate at what point in time there will not be an Earth in that position, and push the person in. For those who are horrified at the idea, I'll say that this system has the potential for some great advances in bringing things from one place to another. Say you have a lot of toxic waste, or spent nuclear fuel. Simply calculate the time at which that point in space will be filled by, say, a star, and push all the unwanted material in. Foom! - all the waste is gone. Quite the handy-dandy kitchen appliance. In all seriousness, though, the effects of this system depend on how many people have access to it. If anyone in power thinks of the execution method I described above, they would instantly make a push for strict regulation of the devices. We'll confine that to Area 51, thank you very much. Honestly, government regulation depends on just who came up with the idea. If it's a relatively secret (i.e. classified DoD or MI5) government project, its very existence will be most likely hushed up. If it's a defense contractor, or a private company, word could spread. And if some guy/girl came up with it in his/her backyard, we're in trouble. On to paradoxes. There are plenty: the grandfather paradox, the killing-the-inventor paradox, and the becoming-your-own-mother-or-father paradox. These are all fairly big problems in science, as they throw causality out the window. The only hope is that traveling in time fulfills what has already (or what will already) happen. The other hope is that of the multiverse (where each universe splits upon each decision, and if you kill your grandfather this all happens in another universe), but that's highly, highly speculative. So scientists would love to study the paradoxes. Other applications. Hmm. Tricky. Well, not really, but hard to narrow it down. You could travel in time to test theories, take tours of famous places and meet famous people, and really do anything you want. However, there is a limit to what you could do. If the reference point is the Sun, you could only travel back in time in multiples of one year. Of course, all you'd have to do to travel to another point in time is to go back a bit further and wait it out, but that's a bit boring. Unless you're sipping pina coladas with Julius Caesar. 

A naval assault will be necessary (by the high-tech guys) to establish bases. Capture coastal towns and cities; these will be well-defended but easy to breach by shear force. They need to be completely abandoned so they can e re-purposed; allow everyone to live if it means that they'll leave. Use these cities as airbases. Aircraft carriers can shuttle planes to them. For small craft, you don't need proper runways. During WWII, pilots made use of what they had. Larger bombers can then fly over to the bases, and restock. They then prepare for the next stage. The cheapest and quickest option is a strategic bombing campaign. The purpose here is more fear than devastation, although destruction works, too. The high-tech guys can drop bombs wherever they want; it'll scare the hell out of the locals. Heck, all you need is to show a picture of an atomic explosion to a villager, and they'll pretty much surrender. The high-tech folks need to intimidate. Strategic bombing can help that. Try to avoid civilian targets, though. Keep casualties down. 

Pay for elves Joe estimates that it would take 85,851 elves working 16 hours each day for 364 days to make roughly 2 billion toys. If Santa pays his elves about \$10.00 per hour (in US dollars), that costs $$85,851 \text{ elves}\times\$10.00\text{ per hour}\times5824\text{ hours per elf}=\$5\text{ billion}$$ Let's multiply that by 2 to take into account support staff and elves working in Santa's other departments (energy, farming, etc.). So paying the elves alone costs \$10 billion. Nolo estimated an elf population 2-7 times that high. So we could actually be looking at \$20 billion to \$70 billion. The cost of toy materials Let's say each toy costs \$5.00 to make in terms of raw materials (if it takes an elf 15 minutes to make each toy, labor is \$2.50 per toy). The cost of the materials (and the cost of using tools for toy-making) then is $$\$2\text{ billion toys}\times\$5.00\text{ per toy}=\$10\text{ billion}$$ As expected, making toys is really, really expensive. Energy There has been quite a lot of dispute on the energy Santa needs to make his journey. I'm going to present several different results based on different calculations: 

$h$ depends strongly on the properties of the materials, which can be hard. We can make some estimates for the other quantities, though. 

Toroidal. Bear with me here. This is going to take some explanation, but maybe I can explain myself. Shokhet and Cort Ammon solved the problem of making sure that the station spins properly. A cylinder is probably the simplest solution to that problem, because it's easy to build and maintain. The problem, though, is that it soon becomes hard to get from one end to the other. As you mentioned, Cort Ammon, 

I bring you all to the planet Krikkit1, stuck in a star system enshrouded by a large dust cloud which prevents the Krikkiters from seeing the rest of the galaxy - and, by extension, the universe. The planet is a solitary, Earth-like one, orbiting a solitary, Sun-like star. But the dust cloud wasn't always there. As per Hitchhiker's canon, the dust cloud is the remnants of a large computer, which was subsequently pulverized. It's safe to say that the system was about middle-aged at the time. That's the work of Douglas Adams. Now my work begins. Many stars have protoplanetary nebulae - clouds of gas and dust that are the remnants of the giant molecular clouds in which the stars formed. They soon dissipate, although the protoplanetary disk remains. How could a star gain a dust envelope partway through its life? Some things to be aware of: 

I believe this idea satisfies all of the requirements. It's automated and completely mechanical; humans will need to stoke the fires, but that can be done when an object is not visible. The ring may actually need to be made into multiple rings if different objects move at different speeds across the celestial sphere, but that can be done without too much trouble. 

Both of these let you place the planet further from the melee. It's worth noting, by the way, that only the half of the planet facing the binary system would be significantly coated, unless an accretion disk of sorts was the form around it. Additionally, the depth of the coating would be non-uniform. What would be the effects on the planet from the merger? Radiation from such a merger should be emitted isotropically, i.e. most of should spread out equally in all directions.2 It's possible that some emissions could be constrained to thin beams, but this certainly won't be the case for all of the electromagnetic emission. Let's look at the energies and luminosities involved: 

Yes. For large animals, octopuses are a possible source of inspiration. They have neurons in their arms, which lets them have a very large brain-to-body ratio. This does let their arms move without as much direct control from the brain. You could also argue that this sort of structure can be found in leeches. They don't really have 32 brains, one inside each body segment, but they do have one ganglion per body segment, which in a sense exerts local control over that segment. Each ganglion cannot operate independently from the others - that is, it's not like there are 32 individual nervous systems working in unison. Keep in mind that the segmented structure of the leech is what makes this sort of thing evolutionarily possible. You're probably not going to see this arise in animals like humans, for instance, because there's simply no need. A centralized organ is much simpler than miscellaneous localized ones. 

With regards to the real-world, the NOAA says that some deep-sea crabs have low-level UV sensitivity in certain pigments. This would seem to indicate that creatures there may emit UV light - which is exactly what you're looking for - potentially as a form of communication1: 

floodmap.net has a tool with quite a large range (0-800 meters). I set it to 49 meters, and got some interesting results: Eastern United States: 

It blocks the vessel from doing anything (seeing the opponent, launching missiles, etc.). It's temporary, must be replaced, and may not last long. 

Let's first think about what causes solar flares. The processes behind them are not substantially well-understood, but we do have some ideas. Magnetic reconnection is one possibility. Essentially, the magnetic field of the Sun quickly changes in shape and topology, releasing a substantial amount of energy. The result? A solar flare, a coronal mass ejection, or something similar. The same sort of process likely happens in flare stars. So, if you want to trigger a solar flare, what do you have to do? Disrupt the Sun's magnetic field. The great bit about this strategy is that there isn't really long-lasting damage to the Sun, like there might be if you chucked another star at it (pro-tip: don't do this!). If you can, for instance, subject it to another really strong magnetic field, you just might be able to trigger reconnection. Okay, but how can we do this? The ideal source of the magnetic field is . . .

I'm not doing anything on the machine level, i.e. working with bits themselves. I don't have to know how a computer works to write a program; I just need to know how that language works. It won't necessarily make sense to write software on the machine level if it's being constantly written and rewritten, because that would be - ironically - inefficient. However, for smaller numbers of qubits, I suppose it might be practical to essentially work on a qubit-by-qubit basis. 

A simple solar telescope, sort of like the one I've used. I would assume that a Dyson ring would also show up on such a telescope (although I can't test it out). It should dim the star in certain places, showing up as either a black ring or a series of small dots. Assuming they're large enough, and the ring's thick enough, you can see them - and all just using a pretty simple instrument. Also, consider KIC 8462852, also known as Tabby's Star. A couple years ago, Tabby's Star made some headlines because of unexplained dimming. Its light curve didn't match any of the patterns you'd expect to see from an F-type star; the dimming was large-scale and highly irregular. Some people thought that the cause was aliens, trying to signal something, and that's what made headlines. What I remember Tabby's Star for, though, are the other hypotheses explaining the dimming: 

These aren't too scientific, and (while almost certainly used in the past) may not be the most effective methods, although I don't have any better ideas. . . 

Nations likely have borders that can be approximated as many connected line segments, and can therefore be approximated as polygons (in some cases, borders and straighter, depending on the political history of the country). Let's say you pick a set of $n$ points on the border and draw straight line segments between them. The resulting polygon is approximately the shape of the nation. Give point $i$ the Cartesian coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$. The formula for the area of the polygon is thus $$A=\frac{1}{2}\left[(x_1y_2-y_1x_2)+(x_2y_3-y_2x_3)+\cdots+(x_{n-1}y_n-x_{n-1}y_n)+(x_ny_1-y_nx_1)\right]$$ For anyone who's curious, this arises as a sum of determinants. It can be applied to continuously differentiable parameterized borders via Green's Theorem. If you want to take curvature into account, things get a bit trickier. Each line on the surface of the planet - which we'll model as a sphere - can be viewed as an arc of some angular length $\theta_i$. The area of this spherical polygon is now $$A=\left[\left(\sum_{i=1}^n\theta_i\right)-\pi(n-2)\right]R^2$$ where $R$ is the radius of the planet and $\theta_i$ is the angular length of the arc connecting point $i$ and point $i+1$. You need a pretty large $n$ for complicated countries, but for countries like Egypt, for instance, you only need a few points. Here's an example of how I'd lay out points on a map ($n=7$):
