Please excuse my over-simplified treatment. Also people are still thinking about what entropy to this day. Please also In Search of a Structure, Part I: On Entropy (Gromov, 2012) 

Is there any way to regularize this infinite product? $$ \det \Delta = \prod_{a,b > 0} (a^2 + b^2) $$ I tried to say this was the derivative at $0$ of an L-function $$ \zeta_{K}'(0) = \sum_{(a,b)} \log (a^2 + b^2) $$ and perhaps this can be evaluated using a functional equation (which I don't know off-hand). 

Then there are square-free numbers and $\{ n : n^2 + 1 \text{ is square-free} \}$. I have been looking through various sources... such as Roth's book who writes very abstractly. In a sense, chosen any correctly-chosen set can have positive upper density, but are there any good examples that you are aware of? Erdos may have come up with a few. I considered making my coin-flip example deterministic. 

The finite intersection property: If $C_\alpha$ (for $\alpha\in I$) are closed subsets in a compact space, and every finite intersection of $C_\alpha$-s is nonempty, then the whole intersection $\bigcap_{\alpha\in I}C_\alpha$ is nonempty. Proof. Otherwise, the complement $\bigcup_{\alpha\in I}C_\alpha^c$ is an open cover of the space without a finite subcover. You may prefer the version with the $C_\alpha$-s compact and no assumption on the space containing them, but this is the same since we can intersect all $C_\alpha$-s with some fixed $C_{\alpha_0}$. To me, it is surprising that this trivial proof gives such a useful assertion. One may argue that this boils down to De Morgan's Laws, which are also trivial but very useful! 

The matrices in $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are invertible. The generated algebras are substantially smaller than $M_n(\mathbb{F})$. "Constants" matter. E.g., an approach 10 times faster is a blessing. 

This question assumes familiarity with combinatorial cardinal characteristics of the continuum. Identify an infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ with its increasing enumeration. Thus, for each natural number $n$, $a(n)$ is the $n$-th element of $a$ in increasing order. This way, every infinite set of a natural number is a member of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$. For $f,g\in\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$, write $f\le^{\infty}g$ if $f(n)\le g(n)$ for infinitely many $n$. That is, if $g\not<^* f$. For an infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$, let $a^{c}$ be its (infinite) complement in $\mathbb{N}$. Thus, $a$ and $a^{c}$ are both in $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$, and the following notion is natural. A set $Y\subseteq\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ is bi-nondominating if there is an infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$ such that $Y\le^{\infty}a,a^{c}$. That is, for each $f\in Y$ we have that $f\le^{\infty}a$ and $f\le^{\infty}a^{c}$. Definition. $\mathfrak{bidi}$ is the minimal cardinality of a set $Y\subseteq\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ that is not bi-nondominating. That is, such that for each infinite co-infinite set $a\subseteq\mathbb{N}$, there is $f\in Y$ such that $a\le^{*}f$ or $a^{c}\le^{*}f$. It follows immediately that $\mathfrak{b}\le\mathfrak{bidi}\le\mathfrak{d}$. It can be shown that if we close the sequences in $Y$ under left shifts, then a witness for $Y$ being bi-nondominating actually reaps $Y$. Thus, $\mathfrak{bidi}\le\mathfrak{r}$, the reaping (or unsplitting) number. Since bounded sets in the Baire space $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$ are meager, and the operator $a\mapsto a^{c}$ is a hoemomorphism from the Cantor space $P(\mathbb{N})$ onto itself, we also have that the covering number for meager (or Baire first category) sets, $\mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M})$, is not greater than $\mathfrak{bidi}$. In summary, we have: $$ \max\left\{ \mbox{cov}(\mathcal{M}),\mathfrak{b}\right\} \le\mathfrak{bidi}\le\min\left\{ \mathfrak{r},\mathfrak{d}\right\} . $$ Questions. 1. Is $\mathfrak{bidi}$ a new combinatorial cardinal characteristic of the continuum? 

I am having trouble finding a mathematical definition of the Brouillin zone beyond the first, which are basically the Voronoi cells or Wigner-Seitz cells. We could imagine the set of point closer to a particular integer than any other: $$ \min_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \big|\big|x - n \big|\big|$$ While straightforward in one dimension, these shapes can be rather nuanced in higher dimensions. $$ \min_{\vec{n} \in L.\mathbb{Z}^m} \big|\big|\vec{x} - \vec{n} \big|\big|$$ Even for Hexagons, the Brouillin zones look rather complicated. 

Are there many implementations of the "domino shuffling" algorithm as found in math.CO/9801068? This topic may be out of fashion now but I wonder if any source code is circulating. I'm doing it myself, but I always have this fear of "reinventing the wheel". 

From what I gather, there are generatic Siegel Veech constants and constants for specific surfaces. Fine. Why does this paper suggest, is it equivalent to count square-tiled surfaces of a given size? 

I understand your question to mean "must we chose an element $x_n$ for all $n$?". (This is in accordance with the comments.) Answer. Officially, the answer is "Yes", you must chose an element for each $n$. However, as pointed out in the comments, often you can prove this makes no difference if you are allowed to not chose elements. This is true for all classic selective covering properties of type $S_1(A,B)$. For some properties this is not entirely trivial, but still provable. For example, $S_1(\Gamma,\Gamma)=S_{\le 1}(\Gamma,\Gamma)$ because WLOG the covers get finer with $n$. If you think about it, this is the essence of the now-classic proof that $S_1(\Gamma,\Gamma)=S_\text{fin}(\Gamma,\Gamma)$. 

I did not conduct an extensive literature search. I would appreciate your pointing out relevant results that are not mentioned here. Question: Are there additional cardinals $\kappa$ for which $f(\kappa)$ can be evaluated in ZFC? (The question also applies to large cadrinals. I do not request that the cardinals provably exist.) Update. Intially, I also asked whether $\kappa^{\aleph_0}=\kappa$ could be weakened to ${\rm cof}([\kappa]^{\aleph_0},\subseteq)=\kappa$. Todd Eisworth reminds in the comments below that the latter hypothesis is true in ZFC for $\aleph_1$. Strangely, I couldn't find an explicit reference for the following. Question. Is it consistent (modulo suitable large cardinals) that $f(\aleph_1)<2^{\aleph_1}$? Assuming that (See Assaf Rinot's comment below), is there an explicit reference for that? Motivation: The values $f(\kappa)$ pop up whenever I study (usually, jointly with colleagues) the character and other cardinal invariants of topological groups. They are unavoidable. (Comment: By no means do I mean that the symbol $f(\kappa)$ should be reserved for the function thus defined. This is just a short, temporary name for brevity.) 

I am not a complex analyst, but I have been examining interpolation problems of this kind. Here is the caricature I currently have for this result: 

In order to address this question, I tried writing the two formulas in bra-ket notation: $$ \langle f |U | z \rangle = z \langle f| z\rangle \hspace{0.5in} \langle f |V| z \rangle = \langle f| e^{-2\pi i \theta} z\rangle $$ Here $\langle f | \in L^2 (\mathbb{T})$ and $|z\rangle \in \mathbb{T}$. In a sense it didn't matter which function $f$ we picked we can just write: $$ U | z \rangle = z | z\rangle \hspace{0.5in} V| z \rangle = | e^{-2\pi i \theta} z\rangle $$ These look like the position and momentum operators and we get an representation of the Heisenberg algebra, since $UV = e^{2\pi i \theta} VU$. 

The free particle SchrÃ³dinger equation is not relativistic: $$ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \phi= i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\phi $$ Dirac had to figure out a way to make a Lorentz-invariant theory. \begin{eqnarray*} E^2 &=& (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2 \\ \left( - \frac{1}{c^2 }\frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2} + \nabla^2 \right)\phi &=& \frac{m^2 c^2 }{\hbar^2 }\phi^2 \end{eqnarray*} At this point we could set $c = \hbar = 1$ which are called "natural units" $$ ( \square- m) \phi = 0 $$ The probability current density is no longer positive-definite. $$ ( i\partial - m)\phi = 0 $$ In textbooks these will be solved over a flat space like $\mathbb{R}^4$ with a unique spin-structure. However, many physical theories are "compactified" to smaller spaces such as $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ it would not be uncommon to solve a theory on a compact space such as $S^1 \times S^1 \times S^1 \times S^1$ and let the circle radii vary. If we set $e(x^\mu) = e^{2\pi i \langle x^\mu , m\rangle}$ then the $m = 0$ solution would need $m_0^2 = m_1^2 + m_2^2 + m_3^2$ and the torus geometry forces $m_0, m_1, m_2, m_3 \in \mathbb{Z}$. This is a diophantine restriction. Also discussed on physics stackexchange: 

Consider for example, in comparison, the law of gravity. Assuming it is true, it is just as spiritual as the natural number 1, or the set of all natural numbers, or the real line, etc. That it predicts something about reality does not make this law itself a part of reality (e.g., you cannot dig it out from anywhere). Thus, its existence is no more physical than that of set theoretic objects. The main difference is that physical laws, predicting reality, can be tested against reality. Set theoretic objects and facts about them can, often, only be tested against the mathematical reality (known facts about other mathematical objects). Perhaps one can think of this as an incremental (or drilling...) process: Reality $\to$ Physics $\to$ Mathematics $\to$ Set theory. I have no expertise in any kind of philosophy, so my answer is necessarily naive, but from the little I read, it seems that deep philosophical investigations rarely make things more clear and are mainly good for having more questions. Given that we need more answers than questions, I do not think the philosophical approach would help much here. 

By unique factorization, there is a finite set that is the complement of these open set: $$ \mathbb{Z} \backslash \{ -1, 1 \} = \bigcup_p S(p,0) $$ This could probably work for any number field. Let's see if I write it correctly. Is it clear? $$ K \backslash \{ \text{units} \} = \bigcup_p S(p,0) $$ There's few literature I could find on the Furstenberg Topology itself [1] Perhaps it has a generalization that is more commonly discussed? Does the Furstenberg topology have any deeper meaning that we know about? Later in his life he should prove Szemeredi Theorem which is entirely also about arithemetic sequences. About two years ago, I asked for infinite Gaussian primes in segments. In standard algebraic number theory these are all merged into questions about Dirichlet and Hecke characters. One person responded that we could use sieves. and filter out the primes that we need. Elementary Proof of Infinitely many primes $\mathfrak{p} \in \mathbb{Z}[i]$ in the sector $\theta < \arg \mathfrak{p} <\phi $ . 

Jech-Prikry: Assume that $2^{\aleph_0}$ is regular and smaller than $2^{\aleph_1}$. If $f(\aleph_1)=2^{\aleph_0}$, then there is an inner model with a measurable cardinal. If $\kappa^{\aleph_0}=\kappa$, then $f(\kappa)=2^\kappa$ (see Hathaway). 

Item 1 follows from the topological interpretation, but can also be proved combinatorially. Blass supplied me with one such proof. This is a cute exercise (or see below). Items 2-3 are immediate. Item 3 was pointed out to me by Blass. Problem. Can the cardinal number $\mathfrak{ufo}$ be identified as a classic combinatorial cardinal characteristic of the continuum? (For me, $\aleph_1$ is definitely a (potential) positive answer.) Here is Blass's proof. I thank him for the permission to include it here. I made tiny changes. If you find errors, this must be my fault. :) Suppose, toward a contradiction, that some ultrafilter $U$ is the union of a countable, strictly increasing sequence of filters $F_n$. For each $n$, pick a set $A_n\in F_{n+1}\setminus F_n$. By intersecting each $A_n$ with all the earlier $A_m$'s, we may assume that the $A_n$ sequence is decreasing (with respect to set-inclusion). Let $D_n$ be the set-difference $A_n\setminus A_{n+1}$; so the sets $D_n$ are pairwise disjoint. Let $X$ be the union of the sets $D_n$ for the even $n$, and let Y be the union the remaining sets $D_n$. Then $$ \mathbb{N}=X\cup Y\cup (\mathbb{N}\setminus A_1)\cup \bigcap_n A_n. $$ The last of these isn't in $U$, because, being a subset of $A_n$, it can't be in $F_n$ for any $n$. And $\mathbb{N}\setminus A_1$ isn't in $U$, because $A_1$ is. So either $X$ or $Y$ is in $U$; without loss of generality, suppose $X$ is in $U$. Then $X$ is in $F_n$ for some $n$, and we may assume that $n$ is odd (just add 1 to $n$ if necessary). So $F_n$ contains $X$ and $A_n$ but not $A_{n+1}$. But $An\setminus A_{n+1}=D_n$ is disjoint from $X$ (because $n$ is odd), which means that $A_{n+1}$ is a superset of the intersection of $X$ and $A_n$. The preceding two sentences contradict the fact that $F_n$ is a filter.
