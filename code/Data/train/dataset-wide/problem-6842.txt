There are two firs in the market. They produce perfect substitutes at cost $c(y_i)=y_i/3$ for i=1,2. The demand function is $p=1-(y_1+y_2)$ Consider the Cournot competition where firms simultaneously produce their respective outputs. However firm 1 has the opportunity to announce the output it will produce to firm 2 before the firms have produced any output. How can I find the equilibrium quantities? ———————— What I have done... For basic case, Cournot equilibrium For firm 1, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_1-y_2-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_1={2-3y_2\over 6}$$ For firm 2, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_2-(y_2/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_2-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_2={2-3y_1\over 6}$$ So, $$y_1=(1/3)-(1/2)(2-3y_1/6)$$ $$y^*_1=2/9$$ $$y_2^*=2/9$$ For Stackelberg eqn in basic cases First firm is mover first $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_2-(y_2/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_2-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_2={2-3y_1\over 6}$$ For firm 1, $$max[(1-y_1-y_2)y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ $$max[(1-y_1-({2-3y_1\over 6}))y_1-(y_1/3)]$$ FOCs $$1-2y_1-(1/3)y_1-y_1-(1/3)=0$$ $$y_1^*=1/5$$ $$y_2^*=7/30$$ I just find only Stackelberg equilibrium and Cournot equilibrium in basic cases. But I cannot find the part that I write above. How can I solve this part? Thank you. 

Consider an oligopoly between two identical firms producing a homogenous good with constant marginal cost where firms face linear market demand. $B_i(q_j)$ denotes firm i’s best response given the output by firm j for i,j=1,2 and $i\not= j$. Let $q_c$ denote the Cournot equilibrium output choice where firms choose output simultaneously. Assume now a Stackelberg setup, where firm 2 observes firm 1’s choice before making its own output choice. Consider the following pair of strategies in the Stackelberg setup: firm 1 chooses $q_c$. Firm 2 chooses $q_c$ if firm 1 chooses $q_c$ otherwise firm 2 chooses $q^*_2 >>q_c$. (A) show whether or not the pair of strategies described above constitutes a Nash equilibrium in the game. (B) show whether or not the pair of strategies described above constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium in the game. 

Two firms are in a market together. They produce a product. Total revenue from sales is $y=K+L$ K is the amount of capital L is the amount of labor These two firms each specialized in supplying one of inputs and the cost of the input supplied is incurred by the person providing it. For capital, the cost is $K^2/2$ and for labor, the cost is $L^2/2$ And they share revenue from their business equally. I need to find firstly that if eac is interested in maximizing his own profit, then how much of each input will they use, and how much profit will each make. And secondly, I need to find the profit maximizing level of inputs for whole business. As a result, I need to compare what I have found in both parts. ———- my solution For firm 1, $$max [1/2(K+L)-K^2/2]$$ FOCs: $1/2-K=0$ So $K=1/2$. He use 1/2 unit of capital. And his profit is $\pi= 1/2*(1/2+L)-1/4=1/2*L\ge 0$ for $L>0$ Similarly, For firm 2, $$max [1/2(K+L)-L^2/2]$$ FOCs: $1/2-L=0$ So $L=1/2$. He use 1/2 unit of labor. And his profit is $\pi= 1/2*(1/2+K)-1/4\ge 0$ for $L\ge 0$ ======= And I have tried to find the profit maximization for entire business $$max[(K+L)- K^2/2-L^2/2]$$ FOCs; $1-K=0$ so K=1 and $1-L=0$ so L=1 And profit $= (1+1)-(1/2+1/2)=1>0$ Now, all parts of my solution are correct? 

I have also following budget set $$B=\{x=(x_1,x_2)\in R^2_+ \mid 2\sqrt{x_1}+x_2\le y\}$$ where y is income. Assume that there are two stories. The agent can shop in both of them. The first store has a quantity discount on good1 as described above. And a fixed unit price of good 2. $p_2=1$. The other store charges fixed unit prices, $p_1=2$ and $p_2=1/2$ respectively. Assume that income y is 6. How can I write the feasible budget constraint for utility maximization $U(x_1, x_2)=x_1x_2$. And since there is two stores, how can I write Lagrangian function for calculation of the optimization problem. I know I have to write my trials. But I cannot write properly any budget constraint and Lagrangian therefore, I cannot post my solution. Any help is appreciated. Thank you. Edit 

Rate of depreciation = depreciation/gross stock in the current year. So 1.7%. Strictly speaking there is no way to calculate depreciation because the timing of capital formation is unknown, but capital begins depreciating as soon as it is formed. 

You are talking about the inverse of the exploitation rate. Workers under capitalism are paid a wage less than the use-value of what they produce, with the remainder going to surplus value. Surplus value = exploitation rate x use value Wages = (1/exploitation rate) x use value 

There was abundant oil supply and the developed countries were splurging on FDI and debt in the periphery Greece had just joined the Euro and was getting tons of transfer payments The Euro was still fairly high and hadn't fallen yet. Greece may have fudged its numbers a bit to get into the Euro. 

Cylical adjustment is simply a trendline based on past GDP. The structural budget balance is the balance with this trend removed. It is similar to seasonal adjustments, except over a longer period. 

$URL$ Very interesting little model. Government infrastructure spending increases wages in the short run by increasing the capital supply, but lowest wages and raises capital income in the long run by boosting the return on private capital. Is this result valid? 

More than 100%. Fractional reserve banking allows banks to create money out of thin air, and they typically leverage twenty times over or more. Despite this they still demand free money from the federal reserve and complain about not being able to hit a button on a computer to lend more money during credit crunches. 

A true labor shortage is when no labor is available for a task at any price. Surely this occurs all of the time if you consider markets that don't exist or could never exist, but has this ever happened otherwise? Has there ever been a situation where a particular type of labor existed, and then dissapeared, leading to a situation where none of the labor in that sector was available at any price? 

It seems that fundamentally they are both driven by revolt risk. Is there some inherent difference in how the two systems are treated in political economics or are they more or less the same type of model? 

It would undoubtedly be India, as enormous segments India's tertiary educated class come to the US to work as programmers for 120k. $URL$ 

The growth of developing countries has been accompanied by rising resource prices and crimping of growth in the First World. This does not mean that anyone is stealing resources per se. It shows that resources are scarce and constrain growth, and one countries' demand makes it harder for other economies to buy oil. The sort of commodity price behavior that we see during rapid growth in the Third World does provide support for a mercantilist, zero-sum, resource constrained view of growth. This does have elements of colonialist/resource imperialist model where the First World invades oil producers to privatize the resource rents. 

The lack of discounting will make tax discounting more valuable. Assuming that the market accepts this valuation it will mean increased effort toward tax deferral and possibly increased investment rates. Corporations will hold appreciating assets for longer periods to defer taxes, and will forgo some short term gains in favor of increasing the expected future tax defferal items on the balance sheet. In practice agents are supposed to be aware of accounting changes though and derive their own valuation independently of arbitrary rules set by some accounting standard. 

According to the LTV, machinery transfers a portion of its value to each item produced. E.g. if a machine is worth 1000 \$ and can produce 10000 widgets during a lifetime of 10 years (after which it breaks and must be replaced), then it transfers 0.1 \$ to each widget produced. Suppose that the machine's lifetime is determined by how much it is used, i.e. by the number of widgets produced. Then, if you reduce the output by producing fewer widgets per unit of time, then the machine will still produce 10000 widgets during a longer lifetime, and therefore each widget will still receive 0.1 \$ of value from the machine. Suppose that the machine's lifetime is also determined by other factors and that it wears off even when it is not used. Then reducing the output will indeed increase the value the machine transfers to each widget produced for that particular producer. However, since the value of goods on the market is determined by the socially necessary labour time, that producer will still have to sell their widgets according to the value they would have when produced under normal, average conditions: society (the market) will not be willing to buy at a higher price from that producer just because he or she has wasted part of the value of their machinery. 

So, no penicillin and randomly mixed chemicals do not have equal value according to the LTV: the machine will pass its value to the penicillin but not to the randomly mixed chemicals. See e.g. Capital, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 1, at the very end of Section 1: "Lastly, nothing can have value without being an object of utility. If the thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it [...] and therefore [that labour] creates no value." 

I am not familiar with contemporary Marxist economists, but the labour theory of value as formulated in Das Kapital does not deny that the usefulness (use value, in Marx' terms) of an item is subjective. Moreover, the fact that an item is useful to someone (however this usefulness is determined by each individual subject) is a precondition for it to be exchanged on the market. For items that are exchanged on the market (commodities) the exchange value is the ratio between the quantity of one good that is exchanged for a unit of another good. Money is a special commodity chosen by a society to measure the exchange values of all other commodities (price). Items that are not exchanged (e.g. air, or something that is produced for personal use but not sold) have no exchange value / price, however useful they may be. The prices of commodities that are sold only occasionally (e.g. a painting) may vary considerably and are rather unpredictable. On the other hand, commodities that are produced, exchanged and consumed on a regular basis (and this is the topic of Marx' analysis) tend to have more table prices. According to the labour theory of value (LTV), this equilibrium price is related to the average amount of labour necessary in a given society to produce each unit of the commodity (value). The reason for this is that, if producers sell a commodity at a low price that does not reflect all the labour that went into making it, they will make no profit or even go bankrupt; on the other hand, if they try to sell at a very high price that is totally unrelated to the necessary labour, there will probably be competitors selling the same commodity at a lower price (unless there is a monopoly). This situation is different from the case of a painting, because the buyer of a painting cannot find another seller selling the exact same painting at a lower price: LTV considers equilibrium prices of reproducible commodities under a given average productivity. Once you have a certain number of people who decide to buy a certain product (whatever personal / subjective reasons they may have) and an average productivity for that product, you can use LTV to explain certain aspects of prices. E.g. LTV would explain why a toothbrush costs less than a Boeing 747 even though the demand for toothbrushes is much higher than that for Boeing 747s by saying that the production of a toothbrush requires (much) less labour. So, as far as I understand, even in Marx' original formulation there is no contradiction between the LTV and a subjective theory of value in that the LTV does not deny that the judgment about the usefulness of a given product is subjective. 

Iran is dumping oil onto the market at about a dollar a barrel. This is boosting the global economy. It is only a temporary phenomenon and the total oil production will begin to fall any time now. Oil is the sole determinant of long run global growth, and real energy prices always rise before recessions. 

Probably, but it's not visible because a country is usually already in shambles before a default, and data collection for domestic debt crises is poor. Here is a list of defaults: $URL$ Here's some rate data: $URL$ $URL$ $URL$ There have been many cases where countries default on only internal debt. Argentina did this. I can't find bond data anywhere. But when it defaulted on domestic debt (1989), inflation went up and the currency fell. Which is pretty much the same as an increase in external interest rates. 

Keynesianism (what you're apparently basing this on) is incoherent and relies on arbitrary eigenvalues such as "autonomous consumption". In real life the multiplier is small and inconsequential. However, the multiplier may appear close to one or slightly above simply because GDP increases the instant the government approves spending in public-subsidised enterprises, due to the way GDP is defined. For example, let's say the government spends $1 to subsidize Fannie Mae and this is counted as a consumption item (for whatever reason). GDP immediately increases by a dollar. Now Fannie Mae spends this on some irrelevant bureaucratic expense (buying mortgage derivatives, legal fees, financial services etc). GDP increases by a dollar again. So we just achieved a multiplier of two while having absolutely no effect on the real world. As you can see, measured GDP is subject to all sorts of random problems that make any attempt to calculate the multiplier pointless. Furthermore, strictly speaking, the "multiplier" is only technically supposed to apply to government consumption, and not transfers as you are asking about. 

The First World mainly holds its assets in equities. The Third World holds its assets in debt. Equities have a higher return. Thus, the First World can run deficits indefinitely by selling it's assets and still gain wealth. Even if the First World net international investment position becomes negative, this is irrelevant, because it's assets will continue to return a higher yield than the Third World's. 

Your shell performs all your business transactions and records the profit. Thus all your profit seems to take place in the Cayman Islands and not the US, reducing taxes. There are other ways to use shells. For example, other people can pay you by making an equity investment in your company, which is untaxed. Look up Corp to corp/S corp tax evasion. In general, a shell company is a company with no assets besides that required for some very narrow purpose such as evading taxes. A somewhat circular definiton, but that's what people call it. 

Return on assets = net income/assets. ROI = an informal term roughly corresponding to return on starting capital, or net income/starting capital. Starting capital is any money invested in the business. Let's say you take out a 500k mortgage on a home with a 50k downpayment. That means 550k of assets. Net of everything you make a $10000 profit from rental income or whatever. Your ROA is 10k/550k because even though you don't own the home free and clear, the house is still an asset. ROI is a more informal term comparing how much you invested versus the return. In this example ROI is 10k/50k because you only paid 50k for the home.
