What is the unitary dual of the Heisenberg group over non-archimedean local fields k of characteristic two? This is well-known for the real Heisenberg group and in fact, when local fields have characteristic different from two, the unitary dual the same structure as for real Heisenberg group. See e.g. "On a notion of rank for unitary representations of the classical groups", Roger Howe Why does this not work for non-archimedean local fields k of characteristic two? Can we not just use Mackey machine? see Page 307 Example 3 in "UNITARY REPRESENTATIONS OF GROUP EXTENSIONS. I" Acta 1958 BY GEORGE W. MACKEY We define the Heisenberg group as a group of matrices (not using a symplectic form) $$ \pmatrix{1 & x & t \\ 0 & 1 & y \\ 0 & 0 & 1}_, $$ where $x,y,t\in k$. 

We say that a C*-algebra $A$ is K-exact, if for any exact sequence of C*-algebras $0\rightarrow I\rightarrow B\rightarrow B/I\rightarrow0$, the sequences $K_i(I\otimes_{min}A)\rightarrow K_i(B\otimes_{min}A)\rightarrow K_i(B/I\otimes_{min}A)$ are exact in the middle for both i=0,1. Similarly, we can define a locally compact group $G$ to be K-exact, if for any exact sequence of G-C*-algebras $0\rightarrow I\rightarrow B\rightarrow B/I\rightarrow0$, the sequences $K_i(I\rtimes_r G)\rightarrow K_i(B\rtimes_r G)\rightarrow K_i(B/I\rtimes_r G)$ are exact in the middle for both i=0,1. It is clear that $G$ is K-exact implies that $C^*_r(G)$ is K-exact C*-algebra. My question is that is the converse implication also true for discrete groups.

Let $K$ be a non-archimedean local field of characteristic $>2$. Consider the Jacobi group $G=H_{2n+1}(K)\rtimes Sp_{2n}(K)$, which is the semidirect product of the Heisenberg group $H_{2n+1}(K)$ with the symplectic group $Sp_{2n}(K)$. Q: Is the left regular representation of $G$ type I? It is well-known that if a locally compact separable group $G$ contains a closed cocompact type I subgroup H, then the left regular representation of $G$ is type I. This fact implies that if $G$ is a linear algebraic group over a non-archimedean local field $K$ of characteristic ZERO then the left regular representation of $G = G(K)$ is type I. (see "The left regular representation of a p-adic algebraic group is type I" by Gootman, Elliot C.; Kallman, Robert R.) In fact, I would like to verify the reduced group C*-algebra of the Jacobi group satisfies the Kunneth formula in the sense of Schochet. We can for instance prove that it belongs to the bootstrap class, which contains all type I $C^*$-algebras. By the way, does anyone know a reference for the fact that the Heisenberg group $H_{2n+1}(K)$ is CCR(=liminal)? In geneal, CCR is stronger than type I (=postliminal=GCR) Note that we talk about local field of positive characteristic and this fact should follow from the classical Mackey analysis in the same way as it follows for the real Heisenberg groups. 

Let $\Gamma$ be a countable discrete group and $\beta \Gamma$ be its Stone–Čech compactification. My question is that Does the $\sigma$-algebra generated by clopen sets in $\beta \Gamma$ equal to the Borel $\sigma$-algebra (generated by open sets) on $\beta \Gamma$? Note that the Stone–Čech compactification $\beta \Gamma$ is extremally disconnected i.e. the closure of every open set in it is clopen. Moreover, there is a one-to-one correspondence between subsets $A$ of $\Gamma$ and clopen subsets $\bar{A}$ of $\beta \Gamma$. There is also a one-to-one correspondence between finitely additive measures on $\Gamma$ and $\sigma$-additive Borel measures on $\beta \Gamma$ by Riesz representation theorem. 

I thought they were the same, just different names. Let me make question more precise: Let $G$ be any linear algebraic group over a p-adic field $\mathbb{Q}_p$, is $G$ a p-adic Lie group w.r.t. the analytic topology from $\mathbb{Q}_p$ in the sense of Peter Schneider? If this is the case, Does the Lie algebra from the algebraic group coincide with the Lie algebra from the Lie group? As far as I can see this is true for real number case. But I'm not familiar with p-adic Lie group theory. p-Adic Lie Groups: Peter Schneider: $URL$ 

Chabert, Echterhoff and Oyono-Oyono proved in [Shapiro's Lemma for topological K-theory of groups] that $K^{top}_*(X\rtimes G;A)\cong K^{top}_*(G;A)$ for any $X\rtimes G$-algebra $A$. They claimed that the result is fairly easy in case $X$ is compact. But I can not see the reason. Is there anybody can help me? Article [Shapiro's Lemma for topological K-theory of groups] can be found here $URL$ I think we have to show the following to begin with: $RKK^{G}(X,C_0(X\times T),B)=KK^G(C_0(T),B)$, where $T\subseteq \underline{E}G$ is $G$-compact, and $B$ is $X\rtimes G$-algebra. 

Let $G$ be a locally compact group which acts non-singularly on a standard probability space $(X,\mu)$. Consider the Koopman representation $\pi_X:G\rightarrow U(L^2(X,\mu))$ defined by $(\pi_X(g)\xi)(x)=\xi(g^{-1}x)\sqrt{\chi(g^{-1},x)}$ for $g\in G$, $\xi\in L^2(X,\mu)$. We say that the action is amenable if the trivial representation is weakly contained in $\pi_X$. My question is that is every action amenable, whenever the group $G$ is amenable? 

Let $k$ be a finite extension of the p-adic number field $Q_p$ and G be a connected algebraic (not affine) group over $k$. It is well-known (see e.g. [1] Proposition 3.1) that G decomposes as $1\rightarrow G_{aff}\cap G_{ant}\rightarrow G_{aff}\times G_{ant}\rightarrow G \rightarrow 1,$ where $G_{aff}$ is the smallest normal connected affine subgroup of $G$ such that $G/G_{aff}$ is an abelian variety and $G_{ant}$ is the smallest normal subgroup such that $G/G_{ant}$ is affine. Then $(G_{ant})_{aff}$ is a connected commutative affine algebraic group, and hence admits a unique decomposition $S\times U$, where $S$ is a torus and $U$ is connected and unipotent. Let $G'$ be a quasi-complement of $S$ in $G_{aff}/R_u$, where $R_u$ is the unipotent radical of $G_{aff}$. If $\pi:G_{aff}\rightarrow G_{aff}/R_u$ is the quotient map, then $\tilde{G}=\pi^{-1}(G')$ is a quasi-complement of $S$ in $G_{aff}$. i.e. $G_{aff}=S\tilde{G}$ with $S \cap\tilde{G}$ is finite. Together with above exact sequence we get an isogeny (see [2] Proposition 2.2) $\phi:(\tilde{G}\times G_{ant})/U \rightarrow G$ such that the kernel of $\phi$ is $(\tilde{G}\cap G_{ant})/U$. Note that $U$ is the connected component of $\tilde{G}\cap G_{ant}$. Q1: Is $\phi((\tilde{G}\times G_{ant})/U)(k))=\frac{(\tilde{G}\times G_{ant})/U)(k)}{(\tilde{G}\cap G_{ant})/U)(k)}$ closed in $G(k)$ w.r.t. analytic topology induced from $k$. In general $\phi$ is not surjective on $k$-rational points. We have the following exact sequence $1 \rightarrow ((\tilde{G}\cap G_{ant})/U)(k)\rightarrow (\tilde{G}\times G_{ant})/U)(k) \rightarrow G(k)\rightarrow H^1(k_s/k, (\tilde{G}\cap G_{ant})/U)$, where $H^1$ is the first Galois cohomology. Since $(\tilde{G}\cap G_{ant})/U$ is a central finite affine algebraic group, $H^1$ is finite abelien group. Q2: Does there exist a finite Galois extension $K$ of $k$ or $Q_p$ such that $\phi$ is indeed surjective on $K$-rational points? I think this is weaker than $H^1(k_s/k, (\tilde{G}\cap G_{ant})/U)=0$. If it is necessary, we may change the quasi-complement $\tilde{G}$.

A countable discrete group $\Gamma$ is said to be weakly amenable with Cowling-Haagerup constant 1 if there exists a sequence of finitely supported functions $(\phi_n)$ on $\Gamma$ such that $\phi_n\rightarrow 1$ pointwise and $\sup_n ||\phi_n||_{cb}\leq 1$, where $||\phi||_{cb}$ denotes the (completely bounded) norm of the Schur multiplier on $B(l_2\Gamma)$ associated with $(x,y)\mapsto \phi(x^{-1}y)$. A countable discrete group $\Gamma$ is exact if there exists a sequence of positive-definite kernels $\phi_n:\Gamma\times \Gamma\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ with the following two properties: 1 For every finite set $F\subseteq \Gamma$ and every $\epsilon>0$ there is an $N$ such that $g_1^{-1}g_2\in F\Longrightarrow |\phi_n(g_1,g_2)-1|< \epsilon, \forall n>N$. 2 For every $n$ there is a finite set $F\subseteq \Gamma$ such that $\phi_n(g_1,g_2)\neq 0\Longrightarrow g_1^{-1}g_2\in F$. It is well-known that for discrete groups weakly amenability with Cowling-Haagerup constant 1 implies exactness. (More generally, AP implies exactness). Is there a direct proof of this result without using the fact that the reduced group C*-algebra $C^*_r(\Gamma)$ is exact as a C*-algebra implies that $\Gamma$ is exact as a group?
