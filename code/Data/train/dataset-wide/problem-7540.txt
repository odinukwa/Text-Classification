A solution (assuming that all transpositions are distinct and are choosen uniformly among all ${n\choose 2}$ possible transpositions) can be given as follows: A set of $n-1$ transpositions $(a_1,b_1),\dots,(a_{n-1},b_{n-1})$ on the set $\lbrace 1,\dots,n\rbrace$ generates the whole symmetric group of $\{1,\dots,n\}$ if and only if the graph with vertices $\lbrace 1,\dots,n\rbrace$ and edges $\lbrace a_i,b_i\rbrace$ is a tree. The probability to generate $S_n$ is thus the same as the probability to get a tree with $n$ vertices $V$ when choosing randomly $n-1$ edges with endpoints in $V$. By Cayley's theorem, there are $n^{n-2}$ different trees with vertices $\lbrace 1,\dots,n\rbrace$. Since there are ${{n\choose 2}\choose n-1}$ different graphs with $n-1$ edges and vertices $\{1,\dots,n\}$, the probability is given by $n^{n-2}/{{{n\choose 2}\choose n-1}}$. If repetitions are allowed, one gets $n^{n-2}/{{n\choose 2}+n-2\choose n-1}$ (assuming uniform probability for all distinct multisets). 

A convex polygon $P$ having an interior point $A$ in generic position (not on any line defined by two vertices) can be encoded combinatorially by associating to every vertex $v$ of $P$ the unique edge $e(v)$ of $P$ such that $A$ is contained in the triangle defined as the convex hull of $v$ and $e(v)$. (Equivalently, $e(v)$ is the unique edge whose interior intersects the line containing the two points $v$ and $A$.) To what extend does the converse hold: given a cyclically ordered set of $n$ abstract "vertices" $v_1,\dots,v_n$ and a function $e$ which associates to every vertex an "edge" consisting of two other cyclically consecutive vertices, does the function $e$ arise as above as the function indicating the combinatorial position of a fixed interior point for a suitable planar realization of the points $v_1,\dots,v_n$ in convex position? A necessary condition is of course that any two "abstract" triangles intersect, ie. the intersection of two distinct "triangles" should have strictly positive area in any geometric realization of the $n$ cyclically ordered points in convex position. Are there other restrictions? (There are none for $n\leq 5$ at least.) Added: The combinatorial situation depicted above can be encoded as follows: One consider $n$ red beans (vertices) $r_1,\dots,r_n$ and $n$ black beans ("edges" or more precisely the intersection of a line through a vertex and the interior point $A$) $b_1,\dots,b_n$ on a circle $S$ where the indices of both read and black beans correspond to the induced cyclic order. We require moreover that every black bean $b_i$ is separated from the read bean $r_i$ by at least one other read bean on both intervals of $S\setminus\{b_i,r_i\}$. This situation gives rise to an involution since the last condition holds then also with colors reversed. In particular, if the necessary condition above is sufficient for a given $n$, then there is also always a "dual" configuration for every convex polygon together with a generic interior point. Second PS: Zaimi's proof shows that such configurations come indeed in pairs as the read and black bean model shows. A direct proof is as follows: Given a realization with vertices corresponding to read beans, define the black vertices (beans) by intersecting all $n$ lines through $A$ and a vertex. A small perturbation into convex position of the black vertices realizes the dual configuration. Zaimi's proof implies that we can count (up to combinatorial orientation-preserving equivalence or up to isotopy, they coincide in this case) the number of such configuration with $n$ vertices in convex position and an additional interior point. There are $$-1+\frac{1}{2n}\sum_{d\vert n,\ d\equiv 1\pmod 2}\phi(d)2^{n/d}$$ of them with $\phi(d)$ Euler's indicator function defined by $\phi(1)=1$ and $\phi(n)$ given by the number of invertible integers modulo $n$ for $n>1$. The first non-zero terms are $1,1,3,5,9,15,29,51,93,171,\dots$ for $n=3,4,\dots$. 

The following relies on the answer of Anton Petrunin and his explanations. Set $X:=\cap_{n\geq 1} f^n(M)$. Claim 0: Each $x\in X$ is a limit point of a sequence $f^n(y)$ for some $y\in M$. Moreover, if $x\in X\cap M^\circ$, then $y$ can be chosen in $M^\circ$. Proof of Claim 0: Assume $x\in X$. Then $x=f^n(y_n)$ for some $y_n\in M$ and each $n\geq 1$. After passing to a subsequence, we may assume that $y_{n_l}\rightarrow y$. Fix $\varepsilon>0$ and $K\geq 1$; we show that for some $k\geq K$, $f^k(y)\in B_\varepsilon(x)$. Choose $l\geq 1$, such that $k:=n_l\geq K$ and $y_{k}\in B_\varepsilon(y)$. Then, since $f$ is distance non-increasing, $dist(f^k(y),f^k(y_k))\leq dist(y,y_k)<\varepsilon$. The 'moreover' statement follows, since we can replace $y$ by $f^{k_0}(y)$, and choose $k_0$ such that $f^{k_0}(y)\in M^\circ$; the latter is possible, since a subsequence of $f^n(y)$ converges to $x\in M^\circ$. Claim 1: For any $x\in M^\circ$ and $r>0$ such that $B_r(x)\subset M^\circ$ and $n\geq 1$, we have $f^n(B_r(x))=B_r(f^n(x))$. We defer a proof of Claim 1 to the end. Claim 2: $X^\circ$ is nonempty, indeed it coincides with the set of all limit points of sequences $f^n(y)$ for $y\in M^\circ$. Proof Claim 2: By Claim 0, each $x\in X\cap M^\circ \supset X^\circ$ is such a limit point. Conversely, if $x$ is such a limit point, then $x\in B_r(f^k(y))=f^k(B_r(y))\subset f^k(M)$ for (certain) arbitrary large $k$; here we choose $r$ such that $B_r(y)\in M^\circ$ and use Claim 1. Therefore $x\in X=\cap_{n\geq 1} f^n(M)$, since the intersection is decreasing. Actually the same argument shows, that $B_s(x)\subset X$ for each $s<r$ (or also $s\leq r$). As a consequence $x\in X^\circ$. Claim 3: $X\cap M^\circ$ is open in $M^\circ$. (Clearly it is also closed, as $M$ is compact and nonempty by Claim 2). Proof Claim 3: Combining Claim 1 and 2, we see that $X\cap M^\circ=X^\circ=X^\circ \cap M^\circ$ is open in $M^\circ$. As $M^\circ$ is connected, Claim 3 implies: Claim 4: $X\cap M^\circ=M^\circ$. Since $X\subset M$ is closed, it follows that $X=M$, and thus $f(M)=M$. Conclusion:Claim 4 implies that $f$ is a distance preserving homeomorphism by CaÅ‚ka, Corollary 3.5 and Corollary 4.4. In particular, $f(\partial M)=\partial M$. A (standard) proof of Claim 1: First assume n=1: Since $f$ is $1$-Lipschitz, we have $f(B_r(x))\subset B_r(f(x))$ for any $x\in M^\circ$. To show equality, let $y\in B_r(f(x))$ arbitrary. There exists a path (of constant speed) $\gamma:[0,1]\rightarrow M^\circ$ of length $<r$ with $\gamma(0)=f(x)$ and $\gamma(1)=y$. There exists a unique lifting of $\gamma$, i.e. a path $\eta:[0,1]\rightarrow M^\circ$ with $f\circ \eta=\gamma$ and $\eta(0)=x$. (The set $T\subset [0,1]$ of $t$'s for which there is a unique lifting of $\gamma$ on the intervall $[0,t]$ contains $0$. $T$ is open since $f$ is a local diffeomorphism on $M^\circ$. In addition, $T$ is closed: If $t_k\in T$ converges to $t\in [0,1]$, then there is a unique lift $\eta_0$ of $\gamma$ on $[0,t)$. Since $M$ is compact and $\eta_0$ is Lipschitz, we can extend it to a path $\eta_1:[0,t]\rightarrow M$, and we have automatically $f(\eta_1(s))=\gamma(s)$ for $s\in [0,t]$. Since $length(\eta_1)=length(\gamma\vert_{[0,t]})<r$ as $f$ is an infinitesimal isometry, we have $\eta_1(t)\in B_r(x)\subset M^\circ$ and therefore $t\in T$, as desired.) Since $f$ is an (infinitesimal) isometry, length($\eta$)=length$(\gamma)<r$ and thus $\eta(1)\in B_r(x)$. Therefore $y=f(\eta(1))\in f(B_r(x))$, as claimed for $n=1$. For arbitrary $n\geq 2$, note that $f^{n-1}(B_r(x))=B_r(f^{n-1}(x))$ by induction. The domain invariance theorem (applied locally to $f^{n-1}$) implies that $f^{n-1}(M^\circ)\subset M^\circ$; hence if $B_r(x)\in M^\circ$, then so is $f^{n-1}(B_r(x))$. Applying Claim 1 for $n=1$ to the ball $B_r(f^{n-1}(y))$ yields Claim 1 for $n$. 

$a_1 = 0$. $a_{k+1} \leq a_k+1$, If $a$ contains an $i\geq 1$, then there is an $i-1$ after the first $i$, 

Many Thanks! -- this is not a strictly mathematical question, but I hope it is still suitable here. The graphs that are test cases can be found in dreadnaut format here: counter example to the Hirsch conjecture, 600-cell, and 1000 typical examples. 

This question actually didn't come up in my own research but some collaborator of mine asked this question at dinner these days. I thus don't know more about the background of the question, but my impression would be that if anything is known, this is the right place to ask. Thanks, Christian 

I suggest, you really look carefully into the reference "Humphreys, Reflection and Coxeter groups" (link behind paywall), as you again find the answer there. Please look into the reference for details below. In case, you have no access to it, you might be lucky searching for it on the web (you can also drop me a line). First, one has to define a root system for $W$ (done in Section 5.4) as $\Phi = \{w(\alpha_s) : w \in W, s \in S\}$. Then there is a decomposition $\Phi = \Phi^+ \sqcup -\Phi^+$ with $\Phi^+ = \Phi \cap \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\Delta$ for $\Delta = \{\alpha_s : s \in S\}$. And finally, by construction, $R = \{ s_\beta : \beta \in \Phi^+\}$ and this is a bijective correspondence. So the answer to your question is yes. 

Thanks for asking this question! It really is a perfect occation for me advertising (once again) the combinatorial statistic finder $URL$ To search the database for partitions, see $URL$ 

Not an answer but a reformulation: Such a configuration gives rise to a set of $n$ points on a large $d-$dimensional sphere forming only $k$ different pairwise angles. Indeed, add a very large last coordinate $\rho$ and make a suitable perturbation (always possible since all non-zero determinants are roughly linear in $\rho$ and you need only a perturbation of order $1/\rho^2$). Considering the Gram matrix formed by scalar products of these $n$ points, we get a symmetric positive definite matrix $G$ of rank $d+1$ with coefficients in a set with $k$ elements. Subtracting $\lambda I_n$ from $G$ where $\lambda$ is the minimal eigenvalue of $G$, the problem is equivalent to the problem of determining all positive definite matrices of rank $\leq d$ with constant diagonal and off-diagonal coefficients in a finite set with $k$ elements. 

There are a few computational tricks which are useful in experimental mathematics. These tricks are mostly very elementary and often only given as exercices in books. A typical example is the following: Suppose that a sequence $s_0,s_1,s_2,\dots$ converges exponentially fast. Then the sequence $t_i=s_i-\frac{(s_{i+1}-s_i)^2}{s_{i+2}-2s_{i+1}+s_{i}}$ converges (generally) faster and has the same limit. Having only access to a few initial terms of a sequence which seems to converge quickly, this trick improves thus guesses concerning the limit. This suggests two questions: 

Is there a nice book/article containing a list of useful tricks "ready for use"? What tricks are useful for you? 

Your last guess is correct. The smallest prime number $>2n$ works, see [Preissmann, Emmanuel; Mischler, Maurice Seating couples around the King's table and a new characterization of prime numbers. Amer. Math. Monthly 116 (2009), no. 3, 268--272.] 

I need to compute canonical forms of many (~10^6-10^8) vertex-facets incidence graphs of polytope. Two rather big examples I want to consider are 

If I see it correctly, there is not much going on in the set $X(G)$ from the viewpoint of Coxeter systems: Let $S$ be the simple system and let $G$ be the Coxeter graph of $(W,S)$ with vertex set $S$. Then $$X(G) = \big\{ s_1 \cdots s_k \in W \mid \{s_1,\ldots,s_k\} \subseteq S\text{ with } s_is_j = s_js_i \text{ for all } 1 \leq i<j \leq k\big\}.$$ Since different choices of $s_1,\ldots,s_k$ yield different elements, $X(G)$ is in bijection with totally disconnected subsets of $G$. This is, $\mathcal{D}(G) = \{ A \subseteq G \mid A \text{ finite and totally disconnected}\}$ and $\mathcal{D}(G) \rightarrow X(G)$ given by $A = \{ s_1, \ldots s_k\} \subseteq G$ of size $k$ is sent to $s_1\cdots s_k \in X(G) \subseteq W$ is a bijection. In particular, $X(G)$ is finite for finite $S$ even if $W$ is infinite. Observe that I used that any two reduced words have the same simple generators involved. Thus, your desired property means that your element lives in a standard parabolic subgroup of type $\mathbb{A}_1^k$ for some $k$. This is exactly the describtion I gave. 

This is Exercise 7.2(f) in Stanley "Enumerative Combinatorics II": The length of the longest chain in dominance order is $$\frac{1}{3}m(m^2+3r-1)$$ where $n = \binom{m+1}{2} + r$ with $0 \leq r \leq m$. 

The statement does indeed hold in type H3; you can find the computation at $URL$ The machine is still running (and I don't know how long it might take) doing type H4. So, if no Coxeter theoretic proof is known, there is hope to find one... 

The permutation group of two elements is abelian, the permutation group of three elements is not. There are thus non-galoisian number fields of degree $3$. 

Are there any known necessary or sufficient conditions such that $$\lim_{a\rightarrow \infty}\int_{-1}^1f(t)^a\cos(at)dt=0$$ where $f:[-1,1]\rightarrow[1,\infty)$ is an even smooth concave real function such that $f(-1)=f(1)=1$? 

Topics in geometric group Theory by P. de la Harpe should also contain this and is very well written. 

The closure of this set in $[0,1]$ is exactly the subset $\mathcal C$ of all real numbers whose continued fraction expansions involve only different numbers. Rational numbers are fine for membership in $\mathcal C$ if they have a continued fraction expansion involves only distinct integers. The set $\mathcal C$ is a Kantor set and it is also the closure of all real numbers whose continued fraction is a permutation of $\mathbb N$ with finite support (identity outside a finite set). 

Let me give a try for tempered scales. (In a tempered scale, the ratio of frequencies for adjacent halftones is always $2^{1/(12)}$.) In this case, we want a distance on $\mathbb R/\mathbb Z$ (with corresponding frequencies given by $2^x/2^{\mathbb N}$, invariant under rotations such that $\frac{5}{12}$ is close to $0$ (in $\mathbb R/\mathbb N$). Say we want it to be closer to $0$ than any other element among $\frac{1}{12},\frac{2}{12},\frac{3}{12},\frac{4}{12},\frac{6}{12}$. One possible recipee: Choose strictly positive rationals $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_6\in (0,1/12]$ encoding pleasantness of intervals (say $\alpha_5<\alpha_4<\alpha_3<\alpha_2<\alpha_1<\alpha_6$) and set $d(y,x)=d(x,y)=\min(y-x,\alpha_i+\vert y-x-i/12\vert)$ if $y>x$ with $y-x\leq 1/2$. The graph of the distance function is a symmetric function modelling the skyline of a symmetric island consisting entirely of montains with slope $1$. Pleasant intervals correspond to passes. Remark: The requirement $\alpha_i\leq 1/12$ is slightly to strong: we need only $\alpha_i\leq \alpha_j+\vert i-j \vert/{12}$. 

Gehring shows (for p=n=3) in the first equality of Theorem 1 in his paper Extremal length definitions for the conformal capacity of rings in space. $URL$ that the conformal modulus of a ring domain $R$ (defined via measurable functions) can equivalently be defined as the infimum of $\int |Df|^p$ where $f$ varies among $ACL$ functions having boundary values 0 and 1 on the two boundary components of $R$. Moreover he cites on p.138 another paper of himself showing that $ACL$ may be replaced by $C^1$. It seems quite likely that a corresponding characterization also holds for general n and $p$ (not necessarily equal to $n$), maybe even the same proof goes through, see edit below. Assuming that these results also hold for general $p$ and $n$, it follows immediately from the argument on p.142 of the same paper that the conformal modulus of $R$ can also be reached as the infimum over continuous admissible functions. Edit: Actually the whole argument seems to be essentially spelled out in Rickman's book on quasiregular mappings, starting on p.53, section 10. 

Let $S$ be a closed surface and $F\subset S$ a finite subset. Then for each $f\in F$ there exists an open cylinder $Z_f\subset S\setminus F$ such that $S\setminus (\{f\}\cup Z_f)$ is compact. A complex structure on $S\setminus F$ extends over $f\in F$ if and only if the cylinder $Z_f$ has necessarily infinite conformal modulus. In other words it does not extend over $f$, if there is some cylinder $Z_f\subset S\setminus F$ of finite conformal modulus such that $S\setminus (\{f\} \cup Z_f)$ is compact. If $S\setminus F$ admits a conformal hyperbolic metric, a complex structure on $S\setminus F$ extends over $f$ if and only if the end of $S$ associated to $f$ has finite area (and is therefore a cusp). But as mentioned by seub, in the context you consider, the complex structure is (usually) assumed to be defined on the whole of $S$ (and the set $F$ may be viewed as marked points on $S$). If $S\setminus F$ admits a conformal hyperbolic metric, this is equivalent to the assumption that $S\setminus F$ has finite area and hence all ends are cusps/punctures. Fix a marking surface (a torus) $S_0$ together with $p_0\in S_0$ for $(T^2,p)$. The fact that the TeichmÃ¼ller spaces of $T^2$ and $(T^2,p)$ can be identified follows from the bijectivity of the following forgetful map $\{\text{equivalence classes of markings of $(T^2,p)$ by } (S_0,p_0)\}\rightarrow\{ \text{equivalence classes of markings of $T^2$ by }S_0\}$ for suitable notions of 'equivalence' and 'markings' (which are slightly different on left and right hand side). To show both the injectivity and the surjectivity of this map one uses the key ingredient mentioned by seub.
