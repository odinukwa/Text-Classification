Let $f:X\to Y$ be a proper surjection of complex algebraic varieties. Let $H_i$ denote Borel-Moore homology. Then $$ \mathrm{Gr}^W_{-k} H_k(X) \to \mathrm{Gr}^W_{-k} H_k(Y) $$ is surjective. Question: Does anyone know a reference for this fact? I have a proof, but it's not as simple as it could be. And it uses generic smoothness of $f$, so it's only valid in characteristic zero. 

I just looked at her notes. First she states the result you quote, that if $p_g(S) \neq 0$ then $\mathrm{CH}_0(S)$ is infinite dimensional. But after this she proves that if $\mathrm{CH}_0(S) \cong \mathbb Z$ then not only will $p_g = 0$ but also the irregularity vanishes. In other words $H^{2,0} = H^{1,0} = 0$. It is this statement that is then generalized to higher dimensions. 

The only case I know of where there is a well developed notion of Gromov-Witten invariants for a singular variety is the very special case when the target admits a gluing $X \cup_D Y$ where X and Y are smooth and projective and D is a smooth divisor. You write that you are not interested in the orbifold Gromov-Witten invariants, but perhaps it is possible to define something similar to what you want in terms of the orbifold invariants. Let $X = Y/G$ and set $\mathscr X = [Y/G]$. The Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathscr X$ are given by maps $$ I_{g,n,\beta} : H^\ast(\overline I \mathscr X)^{\otimes n} \to H^\ast(\overline M_{g,n}),$$ where $\overline I \mathscr X$ is the rigidified inertia stack of $\mathscr X$. However there is also a natural map $H^\ast(X) \to H^\ast(\overline I \mathscr X)$ induced by: (i) the rigidification morphism $I \mathscr X \to \overline I \mathscr X$, in particular the isomorphism it induces on cohomology; (ii) the forgetful map $I \mathscr X \to \mathscr X$; and (iii) the coarse moduli space map $\mathscr X \to X$. So by precomposition we get a collection of maps $H^\ast(X)^{\otimes n} \to H^\ast(\overline M_{g,n})$, and even though it seems they will not satisfy the axioms required of GW invariants maybe they are what is needed in your situation. 

As you point out, it follows on general grounds that there is an extension of $v_p$ to a valuation on ${\mathbb R}$ (in fact, there are uncountably many such extensions), but it is impossible to give an "explicit" description. Indeed, not only will any such extension by discontinuous with respect to the usual Euclidean topology on the reals, but it will not be a measurable function. 

I think that the simplest explanation has nothing to do with schemes: the first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of a fixed characteristic is complete. The assertion that the group of $k$-points $G(k)$ of the algebraic group $G$ has $n$ orbits on the set of $k$-points $X(k)$ of the algebraic variety $X$ may be naturally expressed as a first-order logical formula and hence is true in one algebraically closed field of characteristic $p \geq 0$ just in case it is true in every such algebraically closed field. 

To say that $x \neq \varnothing$ is exactly to assert $(\exists y) y \in x$ and the truth of this existential formula will be witnessed by some set $a$ for which $a \in x$. Thus, the set $f := \lbrace \langle x, a \rangle \rbrace$ is a function from $\lbrace x \rbrace$ to $x$. [I think that this point, namely that the Axiom of Choice is not used to instantiate the truth of an existential formula by naming a witness is the heart of your question. I am not claiming that there will be a constructive choice of the witness. It is just that if an existential formula is true, there must be a witness.] More generally, to prove that if $F$ is a finite set of nonempty sets, then $\prod F := \lbrace f : f \text{ a function with dom}(f) = F \text{ such that } (\forall x \in F) f(x) \in x \rbrace$ is non-empty one argues by induction. If $F = \varnothing$, then the empty function is an element of $\prod F$. If $\text{card}(F) = n+1$, then we may express $F = F' \cup \lbrace x \rbrace$ as disjoint union where $\text{card}(F') = n$. As $x \neq \varnothing$, from the calculation above we find some $f:\lbrace x \rbrace \to x$. By induction, there is some $g \in \prod F'$. I will leave it to you to exhibit a bijection between $\prod F$ and $(\prod F') \times \prod \lbrace x \rbrace$ and thereby complete the argument. 

First, some background: recently in learning more about functional programming I saw one use for coproducts that surprised me a little bit: A function $f: A \rightarrow B \coprod C$ may result when considering a computation that starts with an $a \in A$ and results with an element of $B$ unless "something exceptional happens" in which case it results in an element in $C$ that describes / paramaterizes some sort of 

Both seem fine, but like Lee's book, they don't quite cover all the topics you'd want to have covered. Getting past all the foundation work seems to be quite a lot of work indeed. 

Given a topological vector space $V$, let its density be the smallest cardinal $A$ such that a set of cardinality $A$ is dense in $V$. Naively, it seems one of two things happen: 

Recently I have come across the books Combinatorial Commutative Algebra by Miller and Sturmfels along with Combinatorics and Commutative Algebra by Stanley. I will soon own a copy of each. I also purchased a used copy of Multiplicities and Chern Classes in Local Algebra by Roberts. My question is about the edge of research in commutative algebra. Which books (such as the above?) represent the edge of current research? By that I mean complete comprehension of such a book would prepare one to tackle a valuable (but doable) open problem for graduate research. Perhaps this edge is better represented by articles and papers. Are there a lot of these being published and how has this varied over time? I'm trying to get at the current state of the area of commutative algebra by considering the more concrete topic of current literature on the topic, especially the literature that is spawning new open problems. 

Your idea seems to have already been implemented, see Section 2 of Chenevier and Renard's "Level one algebraic cusp forms of classical groups of small ranks". But it appears to be not as straightforward as just applying the ordinary Weyl character formula - you need a certain "degenerate" version of it. 

This is perhaps more of a comment than an answer. In various texts by GÃ¼nter Harder he uses the terminology that the Manin-Drinfeld principle holds for the Shimura variety $X$, the coefficient system $\mathbb V$ and the cohomology theory $H(-)$ (usually $\ell$-adic cohomology or mixed Hodge theory) if there is a direct sum decomposition $$ H(X,\mathbb V) = H_!(X,\mathbb V) \oplus H_{Eis}(X,\mathbb V)$$ into inner and Eisenstein cohomology. The former is the image of compactly supported cohomology in ordinary cohomology, the latter is the cokernel. However I don't actually know any general result ensuring that the Manin-Drinfeld principle holds - but this may very well be due to my own ignorance. But you could start looking through his book (Eisensteinkohomologie und die Konstruktion gemischter Motive) as well as the various manuscripts on his webpage. You will at least find plenty of stuff of the form "if the Manin-Drinfeld principle holds, then we also know that..." 

As far as I understand, no, Vaught's Conjecture has not been resolved. We held a reading seminar on Robin Knight's proposed counter-example closely following each of his drafts and simplified presentations here at Berkeley some years ago and were ultimately convinced that the draft of January 2003 does not contain a correct disproof of Vaught's Conjecture and requires more than minor emendations to produce a complete proof. We did not discover any essential error, though there were important points in the argument where it seemed to us that even the author had not worked out the technical details. That said, it is possible that revisions he has posted since then are sufficient, though in view of how much time it would require to enter into the details of the argument, I am not willing to work through the later papers until the basic architecture of the proof is certified by some other expert. To be fair to Robin Knight, his work in set theoretic topology is well-respected and his construction takes into account the relevant features required for a counter-example to Vaught's Conjecture. If you would like to know whether or not he believes that his proof works, you should ask him directly. If he says that he does believe the proof to be valid, then you can attempt to check the proof yourself. The difficulty in reading his manuscript is not the amount of background material one must know in order to follow it, but exactly the opposite: almost everything is developed from scratch so that one must hold the entire construction in one's mind without having the usual anchors of established theorems. 

Does such a book exist? Perhaps a second volume such as "Topics in Smooth Manifolds" by John M. Lee would do. Alternatives to consider: 

This was surprising because before that point I had considered the two sides of a coproduct to be reversible, but they can no longer be considered so if the first set is designated as the collection of "normal" outputs and the second set is designated as paramaterizing an "exceptional" result. My question: are there other places where an function/arrow to a coproduct is viewed as an alternative between a normal/regular outcome on one side and an exceptional/irregular outcome on the other? Though I can't think of many right now, I'm guessing there must be computations (etc) where coproducts have an asymmetric normal vs irregular interpretation. 

Is there a single suitable reference to study for the smooth manifold (geometry) half of a typical Topology/Geometry PhD preliminary exam at an average AMS group I school? (Note: I know details about the presentation of these prelim tests varies, but at many schools there is a single Topology/Geometry exam, half of which is roughly smooth manifolds "Geometry" and the other half algebraic topology "Topology") Being a bibliophile, I've invested some time looking around at various qualifying exam syllabi until something stuck out: for Topology, relatively fewer books are listed. It seems quite often a book like Algebraic Topology by Hatcher is listed along with one or two others (seemingly to cover certain small gaps). Also, for Algebra, a few books often suffice... the books by Lang, Jacobson, and Dummit & Foote are often listed. One or two of these together with an outlier often suffice. Compare that to the situation with smooth manifolds. One site (which I lost track of... UCR?) I saw listed as many as 8 books as references for the topic! Many universities seem to use Guillemin & Pollack despite teaching manifolds abstractly, rather than as submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$. This is understandable, but somewhat pedagogically suspect and in my own experience as a student, confusing. It appears that the topic of smooth manifolds needs an expository text that fills the same role for Geometry as does Algebraic Topology (Hatcher) does for Topology. Some sensible criteria: 

First of all let me correct you: it is not true that the groups $PB_n$ assemble into an operad in groups. The point is that $PB_n$ is the fundamental group of $D_2(n)$, which requires the choice of a base point. But it is impossible to choose basepoints on the spaces $D_2(n)$ simultaneously in a way that is compatible with the operad composition and the $S_n$-action. What you can do is consider the fundamental groupoids $\Pi_1(D_2(n))$. These carry natural $S_n$-actions and are compatible with composition. Since $\Pi_1(D_2(n))$ is a bit unwieldy one can try to find a "small" full subgroupoid of $\Pi_1(D_2(n))$ which is closed under the $S_n$-action and composition. This is exactly the combinatorially defined operad $PaB$ which you mention: $PaB$ is isomorphic to the suboperad generated by a single object of $\Pi_1(D_2(2))$. Now the fundamental group of $fD_2(n)$ is $PB_n \times \mathbf Z^n$, and one can play exactly the same game. One is naturally led to an operad $PaFB$ of parenthesized framed braids which is defined in the same way as $PaB$ except the braids are framed, that is, instead of isotopy classes of embedded intervalls we are considering isotopy classes of embedded ribbons. (I hope it's clear what I mean.) The algebras over $PaFB$ are exactly balanced monoidal categories. There is in fact a standard graphical calculus for balanced monoidal categories which is based on braids whose strands are embedded ribbons. 

Note that since the ideals of a ring form a bounded lattice, the set $IdealClosure(R)$ is also a bounded lattice. Now if $\mathcal{R}$ is some set of rings, let $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ be the collection of functions which assign to each ring $R$ an element of $IdealClosure(R)$. Again, $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ is a bounded lattice by defining the lattice operations pointwise, ring by ring. Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a set containing at least one representative from each isomorphism class of the finitely presented commutative rings. Then we can assume $\mathcal{R}$ is countable. It seems then that given a few more 'naturality' conditions the set $IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ would likewise countable. For example, without going to far into symbolic logic, a natural ideal closure operator would be defined by one of a countable collection of statements in FOL or ZFC. One obvious condition is this: an ideal closure operation should treat isomorphic rings equivalently, or more formally: if $R_1 \in \mathcal{R}$, $R_2 \in \mathcal{R}$, $\varphi: R_1 \rightarrow R_2$ is an isomorphism, and $cl_1 = c(R_1)$, $cl_2 = c(R_2)$ where $c \in IdealClosure(\mathcal{R})$ then $\varphi[cl_1(A)] = cl_2[\varphi(A)]$ for all $A \subseteq R$. What other conditions are reasonable? Are such sets of closure operations studied? 

There are several rich theories of analysis on non-archimedian theories. Neal Koblitz' book on $p$-adic analysis is a good introduction. Non-archimedian analysis by Bosch, GÃ¼ntzer and Remmert is more encyclopedic. Berkovich's Spectral Theory and Analysis over Non-archimedian Fields introduces his beautiful theory of analytic spaces allowing for a reasonable algebraic topological theory. In Goss's book Basic Structures of Function Field Arithmetic there is a good introduction to analysis in positive characteristic. Your suggestion that this subject might have something to do with model theory is apt. As the above references show, the theory may be developed without model theory, but it has been studied intensively via model theory giving interesting results about quantifier elimination, uniformity across the $p$-adics, and establishing a basis for motivic integration. You might want to look at the paper by van den Dries and Denef, $p$-adic and real subanalytic sets. Ann. of Math. (2) 128 (1988), no. 1, 79--183. 

As you point out, one cannot hope that the Witt ring, up to isomorphism, be an elementary invariant of a field. The strongest statement which I might conjecture would be that if $K \preceq L$ is an elementary extension of fields, then $W(K) \to W(L)$ is an elementary extension of rings. If this statement were true, then the theory of the Witt ring would be an elementary invariant as any two elementarily equivalent fields have a common elementary extension. It is true that if $K \preceq L$ is an elementary extension of fields, then map $W(K) \hookrightarrow W(L)$ is an inclusion [Why? Being zero in the Witt ring is defined by an existential condition.] One might try to prove that $W(K) \hookrightarrow W(L)$ is elementary by induction where the key step would be to show that if $W(L) \models (\exists x) \phi(x;a)$ where $a$ is a tuple from $W(K)$, $x$ is a single variable, and $\phi$ is a formula in the language of rings, then $W(K) \models (\exists x) \phi(x;a)$. The witness in $W(L)$ would be represented by a quadratic space of some finite dimension $n$. One would like to argue that the set defined by $\phi(x;a)$ in the space of $n$-dimensional quadratic forms is definable in the field language in $K$ in which case a witness could be found in $K$ via elementarity. This last part of the argument is delicate as it would require knowing bounds for checking equalities in the Witt ring. The Witt ring construction is an example of an ind-definable set modulo an ind-definable equivalence relation. These are discussed in some detail in Hrushovski's paper on approximate groups ( arXiv:0909.2190 ). With Krajiceck, I considered similar issues (how does the Grothendieck ring of a first-order structure depend on its theory) in Combinatorics with definable sets: Euler characteristics and Grothendieck rings. Bull. Symbolic Logic 6 (2000), no. 3, 311--330. 

I have sometimes seen it asserted that one manifestiation of how complicated the absolute Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbf{Q}}/\mathbf{Q})$ is is that one can not "pin down" any single element of this group other than complex conjugation; the only thing you can do is to study it indirectly via its representations, like the cyclotomic characters and the $\ell$-adic representations attached to modular forms. Similarly one of the motivations for studying dessin d'enfants that I've heard stated in seminar talks etc. is that since the absolute Galois group acts faithfully on the set of all dessins, we can learn things about the absolute Galois group by studying its action on this set. Just as an example I quote: 

According to Schur--Weyl duality, the centralizer of $\mathrm{GL}(V)$ acting diagonally on $V^{\otimes N}$ is the group algebra of the symmetric group $\mathbb S_N$. An equivalent formulation is the existence of a decomposition $$ V^{\otimes N} \cong \bigoplus_\lambda s_\lambda \otimes V_\lambda $$ where $s_\lambda$ (resp. $V_\lambda$) denote irreducible representations of $\mathbb S_N$ (resp. $\mathrm{GL}(V)$), and $\lambda$ ranges over partitions of $N$. If we suppose that $V$ has a bilinear form and replace $\mathrm {GL}(V)$ by $\mathrm O(V)$, then the centralizer is a quotient of the Brauer algebra $B_N$. The analogous decomposition reads $$ V^{\otimes N} \cong \bigoplus_\lambda \pi_\lambda \otimes V_{\langle \lambda \rangle} $$ where $\pi_\lambda$ (resp. $V_{\langle \lambda \rangle}$) denote irreducible representations of $B_N$ (resp. $\mathrm{O}(V)$), and $\lambda$ ranges over partitions of $N - 2k$, $k \geq 0$. In the group algebra of $\mathbb S_N$, there are explicit idempotents whose images are the irreducibles $s_\lambda$, called Young symmetrizers. What's the analogue in $B_N$? Is there a formula for an idempotent in $B_N$ which projects onto $\pi_\lambda$?
