Insofar as technology fails to substitute for all menial tasks, economic theory would dictate that those tasks pay a high enough wage to attract workers, so the wage for those jobs would likely be higher than they are in the absence of a UBI. The only serious pushes I see for a universal basic income come in response to the threat of technology advancement making many menial jobs obsolete, so this may not be as big a problem as you worry about (assuming a UBI scheme is in fact sustainable at all). In this context, the UBI is pitched as a way to more quickly distribute the "technology dividend" to displaced labor instead of letting it concentrate in the hands of capital owners. The strongest arguments I've heard for a UBI are based more on positive externalities. Consider how many intelligent people work menial jobs simply because they're the best-paying available. Perhaps if a few dozen hours of their weeks were freed up (for millions of people), they'd be able to engage in intellectual, artistic, or entrepreneurial pursuits with more long-term benefits to economic growth. This result, however, is contingent upon technology advancing fast enough to truly displace labor in the market. If capital equipment doesn't plunge in price to accompany the initial increase in tax costs, this would be a very hard sell. 

I found the problem, and now I feel dumb but I suppose I should leave the question up so people can know the potential pitfall and prepare for it better than I did. The problem arose from me misreading (and clearly misunderstanding) the equilibrium conditions for the problem, where it states that the interest rate $r_t$ on loans issued today and paid back tomorrow is equal to $\text{rental}_{t+1}$, the rental rate on capital used tomorrow, which is of course equal to tomorrow's marginal product of capital. I had my problem set up with $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1}$, which is incorrect. This means that yes, we should have $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1} = F_K(K(t+1), H(t+1))$, which makes the exercise a simple algebra problem. I just had my subscripts all messed up! Here's why $r_t = \text{rental}_{t+1}$ (summarized from text): If $r_t < \text{rental}_{t+1}$, then under perfect foresight (an assumption of the basic model in the given chapter), people will attempt to borrow infinitely to capture the profit of $\text{rental}_{t+1} - r_t$, and this condition cannot hold in equilibrium. On the other hand, if $r_t > \text{rental}_{t+1}$, then nobody will want to hold capital until the next term, instead attempting to lend all of their funds out. 

Your reasoning for the 1st part is correct. The 2nd part is a 2-period game. You should try to solve it by backward induction. First you go through all the 2nd period subgames. Then you can use the payoffs of the subgames and write up the investment decision subgame as a bimatrix game. However, the question is poorly written and as stated this game has no Nash equilibria in pure continous strategies. Let's go through the reasoning as to why. First, let's find the NE for all possible cases in the 2nd period. 

The underlying reason are probably differences in labor productivity. Assuming decreasing marginal productivity of labor, the real question is why migration flows do not equate labor productivity and wages as would be predicted by simple GE models. I can think of several factors: 

You have to understand how international debt works. These are not loans, but bonds. China buys a US bond for e.g. 98 USD. This bond is a promise by the US treasury to pay 100 USD one year from now. China owns a lot of this type of bonds. Once the bond hits maturity, China is paid 100 USD and the thing it typically does with these 100 USD is it buys the same type of bond again. If it decides it no longer wants to hold US debt, it can do one of two things: First, it could decide to sell all it's bonds at market prices to someone who's willing to buy them. This would be a terrible idea for the Chinese, since they'll lose a lot of money in this kind of fire sale. Second, it could just stop rolling over the debt and invest its foreign reserves in other kinds of bonds. In any case what will not happen is that the US suddenly has to pay back all it's debt at once. It will become more expensive for the US to refinance it's debt, since the demand for treasuries will go down, but this is more of a long run problem. Also, it is not trivial to find an alternative asset market that can absorb an investment of 1200 billion dollars without prices going through the roof. 

What you want to compare is M1 and the currency component of M1: $URL$ Trading Economics is a bad source. 

This would represent an extreme increase in long-run aggregate supply. In the AS/AD framework, this would result in a long-run increase in production growth and a decrease in the inflation rate. How "badly" it will disrupt today's global market? You've built an assumption that it's bad into your question, but sure, it will be bad for anyone who has invested in current energy sources. It will be fantastic, however, for anyone involved in literally any other entrepreneurial activity. The only disruption in such a sudden and unexpected technology improvement would be that some financial institutions would find themselves overinvested in the energy sector. Insofar as they cannot handle the financial capital losses, there may be a private debt crisis that pushes politicians to bail them out again (ideally using the increases in tax revenues caused by increased productivity), or to simply declare their debt null and void. This would cause some consternation, but given that people tolerated financial bailouts after the housing crisis (where financial assets were wasted without any obvious social benefits at all), it's unlikely that there would be overwhelming protest in such a scenario. The negative impacts of such a productivity shock would only be temporary, however. Energy is one of the limiting factors of production, so free energy would cause production to grow as fast as entrepreneurs can find a use for it, which would be very quickly. 

You generally set the price of "all other goods" to \$1, as "all other goods" is usually measured as "dollars worth of all other goods." Then the maximum quantity of all other goods is just the available income. Then to find the quantity of other goods Hulk buys, just find out how much money is available after he vists the gym 20 times. 

As I had hoped to learn enough macroeconomic theory to get some research ideas, my goal at the beginning of this summer was to read through and complete the problems in an introductory advanced macroeconomics text (my first-year PhD macro courses left me more stunned than enlightened). I started with The McCandless's ABCs of RBCs, and quickly found that it was above my ability level when I reached problems I didn't even know how to set up, so now I'm trying Romer's Advanced Macroeconomics. I've gotta say that after having to consult the solutions manual several times through Chapter 2 out of 12, I'm feeling rather discouraged as the solutions involve methods that are not intuitive to me and not discussed in the text. Is there even any point in someone with my skill level tackling such a task? I can't really see myself being a macroeconomic theorist after this, and it seems that the vast majority of empirical macroeconomic studies use reduced-form linear models backed by hand-waving arguments based on principles or intermediate theory, so I'm starting to doubt the utility of studying advanced theory at all. I understand this may be an an "illegal" question here on Stack Exchange, so I won't protest if it's closed. But if not, does anyone have any tips for how to proceed?
