If that were the case, then they would have to print each time more and more money. And this does not happen. If fact, they usually just print what naturally comes out of circulation (bills get old and coins get lost) and enough to have inflation above zero, but not too far from it. (Deflation, as well as excessive inflation, have been shown to cause many problems to an economy.) 

A speculative bid in a Vickrey auction means that it is not what the bidder really thinks that the product is worth. Hence, a speculative bid is anything different from the true valuation of this product by the bidder (either a smaller or a larger price than the true one). In a Vickrey auction, the bidder has incentive to reveal his/her true valuation. If he/she does not do so, he/she risks losing (either by winning the bid and paying more than what the product is worth for them - if price was higher than true valuation -, or by losing the bid - if price was lower than true valuation). 

Of all these concepts, the final one ("net operating surplus") is closest to our usual concept of profit, since it subtracts payments for intermediates, compensation of employees, production taxes, and depreciation. Nevertheless, there are a number of conceptual and technical differences between this and profit as it is usually defined: for instance, the net earnings of a corporation subtract interest payments, while "net operating surplus" does not. Instead, "net operating surplus" can be viewed as a broader measure of capital income. (Indeed, when Piketty and Zucman (QJE 2014) plot "capital shares" of national income in Table XII, they are actually plotting net operating surplus as a share of national income for each country, taken from the national accounts.) Finally, note that all these definitions are quite generic and meant to apply to many levels of aggregation: firms, industries, areas, sectors, or entire economies. The tables with gross value added above show the "production" and "generation of income" accounts for the non-financial corporate sector, but all national accounts constructed using the same principles provide an analogous account for other sectorsâ€”including households, government, the total economy, etc. 

I'm coming at this from a scientific point of view, having had no formal training in economics - most of what I know about it was from self-studying an undergraduate economics textbook. My question is, why do economists disagree so much? This doesn't happen in the sciences. For example, for the question "will a driver in a car with these safeguards survive a collision at 100km/h", most scientists will agree on an answer. It might be conditional on various things (e.g. age of the driver), but most scientists will come to the same conclusion. However in economics, it's different. Faced with a question such as "should we provide more fiscal stimulus for the economy", it's possible that one big group of economists says "yes", and then another big group says "no". To some extent this might be because of personal interpretation of what is desirable. However I would expect that economists should still be able to say something like "if you provide fiscal stimulus, this will happen, and it's up to you to judge whether the consequences are desirable", and yet it seems there's no consensus on what will actually happen. It doesn't help that when I see economics debated in the media, both sides advance what looks like reasonable arguments. Does economics have predictive power? If so, at what point does economics fail to give good predictions, and how should a policymaker deal with economists disagreeing? If not, what's the point of economics (it might as well be astrology)? 

Net annual changes in cash are tiny compared to capital expenditures - and to internal funds available, stock buybacks less sales, and even net debt issuance. 

Since I'm a macro rather than a corporate finance guy, my go-to resource for getting a rough sense of aggregate magnitudes is the flow of funds accounts. Take a look at the B.102 balance sheet for nonfinancial corporate business, and also the F.102 flows for nonfinancial corporate business. The relevant insights I draw from this data are: 

So, the answer is no. Panel (a) is not possible in perfect competition. And it follows much of the idea from the previous answer. The price will be equal to the average cost if the firm is to have zero profit. Moreover, from the maximization of the firm's problem, price will also equal the marginal cost. This situation is given to you on panel (b). 

Suppose the competitive price is P. If you quote at a a higher price Ph2>P, then someone else, say firm 2, will quote at a slightly lower price than you, say Ph2, and Ph1>Ph2>P. Since competition is perfect, firm 2 will capture all the market and you will go bankrupt. But firm 3 may put price Ph3 such that Ph2>Ph3>P and capture all the market. This process can be repeated until the equilibrium price is reached. On the other hand, if you place a price that is below the competitive price, you will go bankrupt. Hence, there is no economic rent because all firms in the competitive equilibrium will choose the equilibrium price which gives them an economic profit(rent) of zero. 

I thought about this question during the height of the Greek economic crisis several years ago. The media was saying that Greece had run out of money, having used funds that had been set aside for a natural disaster, and they really badly needed a loan. Suppose that during this period, an alien spaceship crash-landed in Greece and the aliens proceeded to invade the country. Since Greece has no money (= cannot buy weapons, ammunition, pay their soldiers, etc), and it cannot borrow (since nobody being willing to lend Greece money was the cause of economic crisis) does it mean Greece will be easily conquered? If the answer is no, where will Greece get the money to defend itself from? I'm asking this as an economics question, so I'm not thinking of stuff such as whether NATO intervenes or what the technological capabilities of the aliens are. 

First, one note on the premise. The Fed basically operates a giant ledger for financial institutions, each of which has a certain balance in its "master account". Over $3 trillion is moved between accounts each day via Fedwire, and these accounts are also used for settling most traditional checks and ACH transactions, which include many of the everyday transactions in the economy. Even alternative payment networks not provided by the Fed, like CHIPS, ultimately use the Fed's ledger to clear net payments. When the Fed loans money to banks via the discount window, it simply adds to their account balance on this ledger; many "cyberattacks" that disabled this capability would probably also disable the ledger itself. This would certainly mean chaos, but the missing discount window wouldn't be the most important aspect of this chaos - the real problem would be the breakdown of the economy's payment system. That said, now suppose that somehow the discount window vanished but the Fed's other services continued. There wouldn't necessarily be any immediate consequences: as of the end of 2014, the Fed was lending very little via its discount window. The H.4.1 "factors affecting reserve balances" release shows that the total of "primary", "secondary", and "seasonal" credit provided to banks was virtually zero relative to the size of the banking system as a whole, at $112 million. This is because the discount rate, currently at 0.75%, is well above other short-term interest rates and has additional strings attached; it only makes sense for banks to borrow from it if they don't have good other options. The real purpose of the discount window, of course, is to serve as the lender of last resort. And it has been used substantially in that capacity during times of crisis: for instance, in October 2008 there was $100 billion in discount window lending, 1000 times the current level. (Other, newer forms of Fed assistance to the non-bank financial system made the total level of Fed intervention much higher still.) In fact, the acute phase of the 2008 financial crisis for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, two large investment banks, ended when they became bank holding companies with full access to the Fed's discount window. In general, if a crisis was already underway, I'm sure that a missing discount window could lead to panic. But without an ongoing crisis, I doubt the ramifications of a temporary discount window shutdown would be too severe: the promise of a restored discount window in a week or two would be enough to stem any speculative run, and banks have many options to deal with short-term funding needs in the interim. They are required, after all, to hold certain levels of liquidity, meaning a combination of reserves and securities that can quickly be sold or lent out for reserves. By the way, if not only the discount window but also all other interventions into overnight money markets stopped, then in normal times there would also be chaos. Banks' demand for reserves is inelastic in the short-run and subject to shocks; and if the New York Fed was not elastically supplying reserves to keep the federal funds rate at the target, there would be massive volatility in short-term interest rates. (Volatility in the early 80s, when the Fed partly targeted monetary aggregates rather than interest rates - but still engaged in plenty of discretionary interest rate smoothing - gives a small taste of what this volatility would look like. Or we can look at how irregular rates were before the establishment of the Fed.) This would not be true today, however, because the banking system is awash in excess reserves. 

As mentioned in Herr K's comment, asset pricing is the theory to price assets (such as equity, bonds, options, futures, swaps, etc). For this, you can use models like CAPM/Fama-French (returns), Black-Scholes (options), Swensonn (interest rates), and many many others. When you say empirical asset pricing, this means that you go to the data (and each model deals with a different type of data) and try to price an existing asset based on the information that you see on the market. For example, in the Black-Scholes model, given the current stock price (S), the strike price for the option (K), the time until exercise (T-t), the risk-free rate (r) and the volatility of returns (sigma), you can use the formula directly and calculate the price of the option. Notice that this would be a theoretical price. In practice, you might observe something else in the market. You may want to do some arbitrage from here since there is mispricing (Don't go using this in the real market, but you get my point). For your last question, asset pricing is not necessarily just about the current value of an asset. You probably would also want to estimate future values based on your models. In fact, it is really of no use a model that tells you today's price. For that, you just look at the price on the tape and ignore your model. The whole point of building models is to make predictions. 

I am the last person that should be answering continuous time questions like these, but if there's no one else I guess I'll give it a shot. (Any correction of my dimly remembered continuous-time finance is very welcome.) My impression has always been that this is best interpreted as a consequence of the martingale representation theorem. First, though, I'll loosely establish some notation. Let the probability space be generated by the $n$ independent Wiener processes $(Z_t^1,\ldots,Z_t^n)$. Let there be $n+1$ assets, where the value of the $i$th asset at $t$ is given by $S_t^i$. Assume that asset $i=0$ is a riskfree bond $dS_t^0=r_tS_t^0dt$, while assets $i=1,\ldots,n$ are each risky and are driven by the corresponding $Z_t^i$: $$dS_t^i=\mu_t^idt+\sigma_t^idZ_t^i$$ Assume there is a strictly positive SDF process $m_t$ normalized to $m_0=1$, such that $m_tS_t^i$ is a martingale for each $i$ (basically the definition of SDF) and where $$dm_t=\nu_t dt+\psi_t\cdot dZ_t$$ (I use $\cdot$ as the dot product, which will be convenient.) Finally, let the $n+1$-dimensional vector $\theta_t$ be our portfolio at time $t$, such that net worth $A_t$ is given by $A_t=\theta_t\cdot S_t$. Assume that $A_0$ is fixed and that further we have $$dA_t=\theta_t\cdot dS_t$$ Now I'll state the objective, which captures the essence of complete markets. Suppose that the world ends at time $T$, and that we want net worth $A_T$ to equal a certain stochastic $Y$, which can depend on the full history up until time $T$. Suppose that $A_0=E_0[m_TY]$, so that in a world with complete markets we could (at $t=0$) use our initial wealth $A_0$ to purchase the time $t=T$ payout $Y$. In the absence of these direct complete markets, the question is whether there is nevertheless some strategy for the portfolio $\theta_t$ that will allow us to obtain $A_T=Y$ in all states of the world. And the answer, in this setting, is yes. First, one can calculate $d(m_tA_t)=\theta_t\cdot d(m_tS_t)$. Thus $m_tS_t$ being a martingale implies that $m_tA_t$ is a martingale. Thus we have $A_T=Y\Longleftrightarrow m_TA_T=m_TY$ iff $$m_tA_t=E_t[m_TY]$$ for all $t\in[0,T]$. Note that this is true for $t=0$ by assumption; hence to get equality it is only necessary to prove that the increments are always equal on both sides. Now the martingale representation theorem comes in. Since $E_t[m_TY]$ is a martingale, we can write $$E_t[m_TY]=E_0[m_TY]+\int_0^t \phi_s\cdot dZ_s$$ for some predictable process $\phi_s$. So we need to be able to show $d(m_tA_t)=\phi_t\cdot dZ_t$. Writing $$d(m_tA_t)=\sum_i (m_t\theta_t^i \sigma_t^i +A_t\psi_t^i)dZ_t^i$$ we see that we need $m_t\theta_t^i\sigma_t^i +A_t\psi_t^i=\phi_t^i$ for each risky asset $i=1,\ldots,n$, which we can invert to give the needed portfolio choice $\theta_t^i$: $$\theta_t^i=\frac{\phi_t^i-A_t\psi_t^i}{m_t\sigma_t^i}$$ The riskless asset portfolio choice $\theta_t^0$ can then be backed out from $A_t=\theta_t\cdot S_t$. The intuition here is simple: we need to always have $A_t$ adjust to maintain the equality $m_tA_t=E_t[m_TY]$, but both the expectation on the right and the SDF $m_t$ on the left are moving in response to the driving processes $dZ_t^i$. Hence we need to pick a portfolio $\theta_t$ such that $dA_t$ precisely offsets these movements and the equation continues to hold. And we can always do this as long as locally, our assets span all the risks $dZ_t^i$ -- which can happen more generally, even for $n$ correlated assets as long as their increments are locally linearly independent. (The case here of $n$ risky assets each drien by an independent Brownian motion is a special one.) 

Fama-French library has good data on which you can test your first Fama-French regression model. I have found this video on Youtube that might help you with this first project. Ps.: It would help a lot if you were more specific about what you want to learn. I can give other suggestions, but I really don't know what you are looking for. 

Yes, this is supposed to be the GDP. You can interpret it as being the sum of all aggregate value in the economy, so all intermediary goods and services are already in there. 

Counterfeiting money is clearly a difficult thing for individuals, but surely a country should have no problems counterfeiting another country's currency. Why don't countries do it? For example, for the US to exert pressure on North Korea (or vice versa), it could conceivably print lots of North Korean Won and use that to cause hyperinflation in North Korea. Similarly for Greece to dig itself out of its debt crisis it could just print USD or any other major currency, and convert that into Euros. My best guess is that this isn't done because it's an act of war, but countries are apparently willing to sling cyberweapons at each other, in which case I don't understand why they don't also do this, at least on a small scale.
