The problem asks to prove that the Diophantine equation $x^{3}+y^{3} = (x+y)^{2}+(xy)^{2}$ does not have any solutions in natural numbers $x, y$. I believe that this problem appeared in the section Задачи наших читателей of the Soviet magazine Квант somewhere between the first issue of 1980 and the last one of 1989. Since I don't know much Russian, I haven't been able to locate it by surfing the archives of the magazine that are available online: to add insult to injury, it seems to me that the section in question of the magazine was not a regular one. I would like to provide the exact reference for this problem in a certain document which I am preparing and that's the main reason that has compelled me to ask you this: Did anybody here remember seeing this cute problem in Квант once? If so, would you be so kind as to provide me with a hint that allows one to find out what the actual issue wherein it appeared was? Please, let me thank you in advance for your attentive consideration of this query of mine. 

Can any of you guys explain in greater detail this Newmanian argument? I'd also like to know whether the denomination failure probability formula is a standard one in the mainstream of Probability literature. Thank you very much for your continued support. 

It is more or less easy to obtain, via exponential sums, an asymptotic formula for the number $J$ of solutions of the congruence $$x^{n}+y^{n} \equiv z^{n} \pmod{p}$$ where $$1 \leq x, y, z \leq p-1.$$ Indeed, since \begin{eqnarray*} J &=& \sum_{x=1}^{p-1} \sum_{y=1}^{p-1} \sum_{z=1}^{p-1} \frac{1}{p}\sum_{a=0}^{p-1}e^{2 \pi i \frac{a(x^{n}+y^{n}-z^{n})}{p}}\\ &=& \frac{(p-1)^{3}}{p}+ \frac{1}{p} \sum_{a=1}^{p-1} \sum_{x=1}^{p-1}\sum_{y=1}^{p-1} \sum_{z=1}^{p-1}e^{2\pi i \frac{a(x^{n}+y^{n}-z^{n})}{p}}\\ &=& \frac{(p-1)^{3}}{p} + \frac{1}{p}\sum_{a=1}^{p-1}\left|\sum_{x=1}^{p-1}e^{2\pi i \frac{ax^{n}}{p}}\right|^{2}\sum_{y=1}^{p-1}e^{2\pi i \frac{ay^{n}}{p}}\\ \end{eqnarray*} and $$ \sum_{a=0}^{p-1} \left| \sum_{x=1}^{p-1} e^{2\pi i \frac{ax^{n}}{p}} \right|^{2} \leq n\,p\,(p-1)$$ and $$\left|\sum_{y=1}^{p-1}e^{2\pi i \frac{\alpha y^{n}}{p}}\right| \leq n\sqrt{p}$$ for any integer $\alpha$ which is not divisible by $p$, it follows that $$J = \frac{(p-1)^{3}}{p}+O\left(n^{2}(p-1)\sqrt{p}\right).$$ 

I recently knew of this note in which Prof. M. Henk presents a proof of Minkowski's second inequality on successive minima which is (purportedly) based on ideas in Minkowski's original proof. Let me remind you that, for a centrally symmetric convex body $\mathcal{K} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a lattice $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$, the said inequality asserts that $$(\lambda_{1} \cdots \lambda_{n}) \mathrm{vol}(\mathcal{K}) \leq 2^{n}\mathrm{det}(\Lambda)$$ where $\lambda_{i}$ is the $i$-th successive minimum of the body $\mathcal{K}$ with respect to the lattice $\Lambda$. At the outset of the proof, Prof. Henk makes $K_{i} := \frac{\lambda_{i}}{2}\mathcal{K}$ for every $i \in \{1, \ldots,n \}$ and picks up $z^{1}, \ldots, z^{n} \in \mathbb{Z}^{n}$ in such a way that $z^{1} \in \lambda_{1}\mathcal{K}, \ldots, z^{n} \in \lambda_{n}\mathcal{K}$ and the set $\{z^{1}, \ldots, z^{n}\}$ is linearly independent. Moreover, he notes that the $z^{i}$ can be chosen so as to satisfy $$\mathbf{span}(z^{1}, \ldots, z^{i})=\mathbf{span}(e_{1}, \ldots, e_{i})=:L_{i}$$ where $\{e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}\}$ is the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Then, after defining $M_{q}^{n}$ as the set $\{u \in \mathbb{Z}^{n} \colon |u_{i}|\leq q, \, 1\leq i \leq n\}$ and $M_{q}^{i}$ as the intersection $M_{q}^{n} \cap L_{i}$, it is effortlessly established that $$\mathrm{vol}(M_{q}^{n}+K_{n}) \leq (2q+\gamma)^{n}$$ (for some positive constant $\gamma$) and that $$\mathrm{vol}(M_{q}^{n}+K_{1}) =(2q+1)^{n}\mathrm{vol}(K_{1}).$$ Then, it comes the important observation according to which the desired inequality would easily follow from what has just been proven and from the inequalities $$\mathrm{vol}(M_{q}^{n}+K_{i+1}) \geq \left(\frac{\lambda_{i+1}}{\lambda_{i}}\right)^{n-i} \mathrm{vol}(M_{q}^{n}+K_{i}) \qquad \qquad ... (*)$$ In my opinion, it is the verification of the inequalities in $(*)$ one of the key steps in Prof. Henk's proof of Minkowski's second inequality on successive minima. Unfortunately, even when it may be possible to validate line-by-line the proof which he provides for them, I must confess that it is not clear to me what the overall idea behind it is... In case you grasped it through and through once, would you be so kind as to motivate and/or explain below, in plain English, the underlying idea (or ideas) beneath Henk's proof of the inequalities in $(*)$? Please, let me thank you in advance for your insightful replies, pointers to the literature, etc. 

EDIT: According to Gerald Edgar "limes" is a Latin word. Yet, I will leave it here because I believe that it is a loan word in German which made it to other languages due to the influence of treatises written originally in German. 

Was providing an alternative proof of the PNT one of the main impulses that led to the discovery of the tauberian theorem of Wiener and Ikehara or the other way around? In any case, does any of you people know who was the first individual to realize that, in order to prove the PNT, all one needs to have is the non-vanishing of the Riemann zeta function on the line $\sigma =1$ plus a tauberian theorem of the Wiener-Ikehara persuasion? I thank you in advance for your insightful replies. References [1] P. T. Bateman; H. G. Diamond. A hundred years of prime numbers. 103 9 (1996), pp. 729-741. 

For every fixed $n \in \mathbb{N}$, Rolf Brandl and Shi Wujie gave in Finite groups whose elements are consecutive integers (Journal of Algebra, 143, 388-400 (1991).) a complete classification of finite groups whose spectrum is $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. A particularly appealing spin-off of their study is the following one: Let $i$ be a positive integer greater than $8$. There is no finite group $G$ whose spectrum is $\{1,2,\ldots,i\}$. 

By recurring to Merten's second theorem (once again) and the Abel summation formula, I am able to recover the expected main term but I don't see a way to sense in advance if proceeding thus one is to obtain a suitable error term (I eventually obtain it; yet, one usually prefers to find out whether he/she is on track before actually getting there, right?). I would greatly appreciate any insights, suggestions, or comments you may want to leave for me below. 

It seems to me that Lagrange's theorem may well be one of the most prominent examples of the phenomenon under discussion. According to J. J. Rotman, 

$(\forall n \in \mathbb{N})$ $\, \,$ $p_{n+1}<2^{2^{n}}$. For every $n \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq 12}$, $\,$ $p_{n}>3n$. 

Clearly enough, this theorem implies that there are only two solutions to the equation you are considering: $(x=1, y=3, N=1)$ and $(x=18, y=7, N=3)$. 

Do you know a text where I can find a definition of polygonal number that is both geometrically and operationally sound? I've basically seen two ways in which this topic is approached in the literature. For instance, in the celebrated historical opus by Dickson (volume II, chapter 1), the ancient treatment by a Hypsicles is mentioned: "If there are as many numbers as we please beginning with one and increasing by the same common difference, then when the common difference is 1, the sum of all the terms is a triangular number; when 2, a square..." Clearly enough, the above definition suits just right the needs of those persons interested in determining explicitly the $k$-element of the sequence of $n$-gonal numbers, but it gives no clue about the possibility of representing geometrically all those sequences. That it is actually an issue becomes apparent when one notices that just about every presentation of this topic begins by providing diagrams that illustrate, to some extent, the process by which the first $n$-gonal numbers are built (they will typically focus their attention in the cases $n=3$, $n=4$, and $n=5$) and then, rush to introduce the general formulas without mentioning the way in which the corresponding patterns are supposed to be preserved by them (e.g., M. B. Nathanson. A short proof of Cauchy' polygonal number theorem. Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 99 (1987) no. 1, 22-24.)... As it turns out, what it's at stake here is the possibility of a definition that reconciles the geometry inherent to these sequences and the ease of manipulation offered by an approach akin to that of Hypsicles. 

I would expand the question "What are some good papers that debunk common myths...?" to include web pages as well as papers. Naturally, there is a couple of candidate web pages in the reference section of the note mentioned by sigfpe. Another candidate might be $URL$ where the myth of the rivalry between A. Nobel and Mittag-Leffler is debunked (to some extent). 

In point of fact, it is well-known that if $p$ is a prime number and $a, n$ are integers that are not divisible by $p$, then $p \mid \Phi_{n}(a)$ implies $p\equiv 1 \pmod{n}$. 

Your equation can be rewritten as $$\frac{x^{3}-1}{x-1} = y^{N}.$$ As Gerhard Paseman commented above, the Diophantine equation $$ \frac{x^{n} − 1}{x-1} = y^{q} \quad x > 1, \quad y>1, \quad n>2 \quad q \geq 2 \quad \mbox{ (*) }$$ was the subject matter of a couple of papers of T. Nagell from the 1920's. Some twenty-odd years later, W. Ljunggren clarified some points in Nagell’s arguments and completed the proof of the following result. Theorem. Apart from the solutions $$\frac{3^{5}-1}{3-1}=11^{2}, \quad \frac{7^{4}-1}{7-1}=20^{2}, \quad \frac{18^{3}-1}{18-1} = 7^{3},$$ the equation in $(*)$ has no other solution $(x, y, n, q)$ if either one of the following conditions is satisfied: 

Geombinatorics is a journal on open problems of combinatorial and discrete geometry and related areas. The journal is edited by Prof. Alexander "Sasha" Soifer: he used to have a MO account, but I can't find him in the list of users of the site anymore. 

UPDATE (approx. one year later). I contacted the person in charge of the theses at the university library, she said there wasn't a copy of the said work in the central library and contacted the Math Dept. to see if they had a copy of it, but they answered in the negative. Is there a rationale for this situation? ANOTHER UPDATE (Molley Malone Day 2017). Fellow MO-ers: take a look at what I have just come across while taking a look at the table of contents of the latest issue of the Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde: $URL$ I can't believe my eyes! 

Throughout my upbringing, I encountered the following annotations on Gauss's diary in several so-called accounts of the history of mathematics: 

Let us set $$w= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} 1 & \text{ if } d > \,\,\,\, 0 \\ 2 & \text{ if } d < -4\\ 4 & \text{ if } d=-4\\ 6 & \text{ if } d=-3 \end{array}\right.$$ Then, for every $\ell$ such that \begin{eqnarray}\ell^{2} \equiv d \pmod{4k}, \quad 0\leq \ell <2k,\end{eqnarray} there are exactly $w$ proper primary representations of $k$ to which $\ell$ is associated (at this point of his exposition, Landau has already taught how to associate to any proper representation of $k$ by a form a unique solution of $\ell^{2} \equiv d \pmod{4k}, 0\leq \ell <2k$, cf. Thm. 201 on page 180). I consider that, for negative $d$'s, this assertion can be proved more succinctly as follows. Let us fix and $\ell$ such that $\ell^{2} \equiv d \pmod{4k}, 0 \leq \ell < 2k$. Then, if $m:= \frac{\ell^{2}-d}{4k}$ and $G :=\{k,l,m\}$, it follows that $G \sim F_{i}$ for exactly one form $F_{i}$ in a complete set of representatives of the equivalence classes of primitive and positive-definite forms of discriminant $d$. Then, it is not difficult to convince oneself that there is a bijective correspondence between the proper primary (proper primary = proper, in the case of negative discriminants) representations of $k$ to which $\ell$ is associated and the matrices $g\in \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ such that $gF_{i} = G$. Hence, since any such $g$ can be written in the form $g_{0}^{-1}A$ for a fixed $g_{0} \in \mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ such that $g_{0}G = F_{i}$ and any automorph $A$ of $F_{i}$, it does follow that the number of proper representations of $k$ to which $\ell$ is associated is equal to the number of different automorphs of $F_{i}$ (which is exactly $w$). I suppose that Landau's proof turns out to be a wee bit long-winded because he is trying to handle simultaneously the cases $d<0$ and $d>0$, right? Please, let me thank you in advance for your attentive replies, comments, bibliographical suggestions, etc. 

B. H. Brown debunks in [1] the myth that "Algebra was Hebrew to Diderot" (cf. E. T. Bell, Men of Mathematics, NY, 1937, pp. 146-147). Gillings mentions in his note that it is D. Thiébault's account the only authority in the Euler-Diderot anecdote (even though "Thiébault himself was not convinced of the truth of it..."). It is important to add that in Thiébault's version of the story there is no explicit reference to the name of L. Euler. References [1] B. H. Brown. The Euler-Diderot Anecdote. Amer. Math. Monthly. Vol. 49, Issue 5, 1942, pp. 302-303. [2] R. J. Gillings. The So-called Euler-Diderot Incident. Amer. Math. Monthly. Vol. 61, Issue 2, 1954, pp. 77-80. 

Agreed that a proof of the coprimality of any pair of distinct Fermat numbers appears in the very first paragraph of the aforementioned missive from Goldbach to Euler. That is not under discussion here. Thing is that, as Professor Lemmermeyer noted above, Goldbach himself did not seem to notice that this result would (immediately) provide him with a proof of the infinitude of the primes. As I commented before, one of my initials beliefs on this matter was that the exclamation "at quantulum hoc est ad demonstrandum omnes illos numeros esse absolute primos?" in the July 20th letter was somehow implying that Golbach had actually found the connection between both facts. Yet, your knowledgeable comments have just made me change my mind on this wrong impression that I initially had. You are absolutely right when you express that the proof given by Hardy and Wright passes through the argument given by Goldbach in his letter to Euler. That's the reason that I said it is kind of weird to see H & W adscribing the result to Pólya.

Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $F=\{a,b,c\}$, where $a>0$, be an integral binary quadratic form of discriminant $d>0$ such that $F(x,y)=k$ for some $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$. We say that the previous representation of $k$ by $F$ is primary if 

I am very fond of the device by Landau by means of which one can establish Bertrand's Postulate for every natural number $n$ less than some given constant $C>0$. Let us suppose that we need to show the validity of the "postulate" for every $n<4000$ (as in Erdös's famous 1932 paper). According to Erdös, in the case under consideration, Landau's teachings imply that one does not have to look for a prime number in all of the intervals $$(1,2], (2,4], (3,6], (4,8], \ldots, (3999, 7998],$$ and that it suffices to consider the following list of fourteen primes in which each of them is smaller than twice the other: $$2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 23, 43, 83, 163, 317, 631, 1259, 2503, 4001.$$ Indeed, if $N \in [2,4000) \cap \mathbb{N}$, let us denote by $p_{N}$ the greatest prime in the list that is smaller than or equal to $N$; then, if $p_{N+1}$ is the prime in the list that comes right after $p_{N}$, it holds that $p_{N+1} \in (N,2N]$ and we are done. If a trick is an idea which can be used only once, then the previous "Bemerkung" of Landau (as Erdös refer to it in the aforementioned paper) is definitely deserving of being declared as one, right?

The question's been studied in the category of groups, too. R. Hirshon proved in [1] that finite groups can always be cancelled in direct products. Hirshon mentions some other sufficient conditions for the cancellation theorem to hold. For instance, he says that in the treatise by L. Fuchs there is a proof of the fact that infinite cyclic abelian groups can also be cancelled (provided that either $B$ or $C$ is a commutative group). References [1] R. Hirshon, On Cancellation in Groups, Amer. Math. Monthly. 76 (9) (1969), pp. 1037-1039.
