Based on my (amateur) research, what would be of particular interest with respect to your proof is the question of whether you can extend it into the $2$-adic metric space and show that the same holds for the limit in the $2$-adic metric space of $1 \mod 2^n$ as $n\to\infty$. Which would of course, prove the conjecture. 

This falls slightly short of a proof but is too long for a comment. The question inquires into the largest family of triangulations in which every pair of members shares some diagonal. If we instead fix any single diagonal in common to every member of a family of triangulation of an n-gon, it is self-evident (from the noncrossing property of triangulations) that the number of triangulations sharing it is given by the product of the enumerations of the two families of triangulations of the ploygons so formed either side of it. For any triangulatable n-gon, any given diagonal is a member of up to two fan triangulations, in which it can be assigned an integer the $d^{th}$ diagonal from the perimeter satisfying $1\leq d\leq \frac{n-2}{2}$. By symmetry we may choose either of the two fans with no effect upon the distance of the diagonal from the nearest edge. $d=\frac{n-2}{2}$ shall be the distance of the central triangulation if $n$ is even and $d=\frac{n-3}{2}$ shall be the distance of the two "most central" diagonalisations if $n$ is odd. The number of triangulations of any $n$-gon sharing the $d^{th}$ diagonal is the product of the number of triangulations $\cal T(d,n)$ either side of it: $$\cal T(d,n)=C_d\times C_{n-d}$$ $$\cal T(d,n)=(d+1)^{-1}\binom{2d}{d}(n-d+1)^{-1}\binom{2n-2d}{n-d}$$ The ratio of one Catalan number to the next is greater than the ratio of the previous two Catalan numbers, and therefore in the choice of which diagonal to share, in order to maximise the size of the family, for any given choice $d$ of diagonal which is not at the edge, we may always identify a larger family by choosing the diagonal $d-1$ which is one position closer to the perimeter and by induction the outermost diagonal $d=1$ yields the largest family. The size of the largest family of triangulations sharing the same diagonal is therefore given by: $|\cal S| = C_{n-2-1}\times C_1=|\cal T_{n-1}|$ My claim which would complete the proof (and which remains to be proven) is that there is no family of triangulations in which every pair shares some diagonal, which is larger than the largest family of triangulations in which every triangulation in the family shares the same diagonal. I suspect this is proven by the fact that the largest face on any associahedron has the same number of edges as the number of vertices of the associahedron one order smaller. In particular I believe that each face of the associahedron represents a family of triangulations which all share the same edge. These two statements alone would in fact be sufficient to answer the entire question in the affirmative. 

I'm coming a bit late to this list but I'd like to see some attention paid to AFK's primary proposition in this question which seems to have been entirely ignored in favour of a discussion of his background behind asking it. 

This is a fairly substantial rewriting of my original answer. Sharkovski's theorem, which unfortunately only applies to $\mathbb{R}$ is the definitive theorem in this field and one thing it states is that all cycles will be of order a power of 2, else there will be infinitely many. If it could be extended to $2\mathbb{N}-1$ (or to some suitable extension of $2\mathbb{N}-1$) such that it applied to the Collatz conjecture then the existence of any nontrivial cycle would imply the existence of infinitely many nontrivial loops of certain orders; including a cycle of length 2, contradicting Lagarias (1985) result that there are no nontrivial cycles with length $<275000$ (and therefore proving the weakened Collatz Conjecture; that the are no non-trivial cycles). ST states that a continuous interval to interval function having cycles on $\mathbb{R}$ of a certain order must also have cycles other orders. The orders which must exist are arranged in a hierarchy called Sharkovskii's ordering. Only by talking of loops in the Collatz Conjecture directly from one odd number to the next, i.e. of the function $f(x)=\dfrac{3x+1}{2^{v_2(3x+1)}}$ is it possible for ST to apply. This is because the existence of the trivial $3$-cycle in the conventional formulation is immediately contradictory, while the $1$-cycle in the $2\mathbb{N}-1\to2\mathbb{N}-1$ formulation is not. Since $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable it seems likely such a proof would require a morphism from an interval of $\mathbb{R}$ to some uncountable superset $S$ of $2\mathbb{N}-1$ such that $f(x)$ in $S$ is a continuous function in $\mathbb{R}$. Sequences and cycles in $2\mathbb{N}-1$ are of course isomorphic to a wide range of sequences and cycles which are isometric in some valuation $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$. The true, possible, extent of $S$ therefore is governed by our capacity to define some valuation $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$ which is sufficiently expressive in measuring powers of $2$ to project every $x\in S$ down to a unique element $n$ of $2\mathbb{N}-1$ and the valuation $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$ such that $x=n\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}^{-1}$. The 2-adic valuation over $\mathbb{N}$ is such an example. There's a high probability we require here some extension of the 2-adic valuation to some uncountable superset of $\mathbb{N}$ which is capable of measuring non-integer powers of $2$ to sufficient degree that it captures the full structure of $\mathbb{R}$. The morphism to $\mathbb{R}\to S$ would probably require the property that numbers in $S$ of the form $x\times\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}\in(2\mathbb{N}-1)$ are mapped to an interval in $\mathbb{R}$. This is necessary because proper fractions which are not dyadic, DO have nontrivial cycles in this extension of the Collatz conjecture. Therefore the morphism would need to isolate the integers, proper dyadic fractions, (and any extension thereof satisfying $x\times\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}\in(2\mathbb{N}-1)$ to some interval of $\mathbb{R}$ and map the other numbers to other segments of $\mathbb{R}$ Furthermore, for the function $f(x)$ to be well-defined $2^{v_2(x)}$ must be extended so as to retain isometry as measured by $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$ of all orbits of $f$ in $S$. The appropriate extension of $2^{v_2(x)}$ is of course the inverse of $\lvert x\rvert_{2\times}$ and the successor relation defined by the extended form of $f$ can be defined by: $x_{n+1}=\lvert x_0\rvert_{2\times}^{-1}(3x_n+1)\lvert 3x_n+1\rvert_{2\times}$ 

The answer to the question is "no". It is probably best to think in terms of projective geometry: you are asking for a set $S$ of points in projective $n-1$ space such that every hyperplane contains a point in $S$, and $S$ does not contain a hyperplane. Let $S_0$ be the union of two hyperplanes $H_1$ and $H_2$ with two points $p_1\in H_1$ and $p_2\in H_2$ removed. Let $S$ be the union of $S_0$ with a point $q$ lying on the line between $p_1$ and $p_2$. Any hyperplane not meeting $S_0$ must meet $H_1$ only in $p_1$ and $H_2$ only in $p_2$, and so must contain the line between $p_1$ and $p_2$, and hence must contain $q$. 

This is Theorem 1.10 of Sardari (2017). Let $d\geq 5$, and for simplicity let $L=\mathbb{Z}^d$. Define the ball $B_0=\{x:|x-\lambda_0|<\epsilon\}$ and the normalised ball $B = |k|^{-1/2}B$. Provided that (1) the normalised ball $B$ is contained in some fixed compact set $\Omega$, and (2) the ball $B_0$ has a radius $\epsilon\gg |k|^{\frac{1}{4}+\delta}$ for some fixed $\delta>0$, he proves $$ F(\lambda_0,k,\epsilon) = \mathfrak{S}_\infty(\lambda_0) \Big(\prod_{p\text{ prime}}\mathfrak{S}_p(N)\Big)\epsilon^{d-1}|k|^{-\frac{1}{2}}\big(1+O_{q,\Omega,\delta}(|k|^{-\delta'})\big) $$ for some $\delta'>0$. Provided $q(x)=k$ is soluble everywhere locally, $\Big(\prod_{p\text{ prime}}\mathfrak{S}_p(N)\Big)$ is bounded above and below by constants depending only on $q$. Also $ \mathfrak{S}_\infty(\lambda_0)$ is bounded above and below by constants depending only on $q$ and $\Omega$. (See Remark 1.4 in the same paper) The exponent in condition (2) is optimal, see the second part of Theorem 1.10. It is possible that condition (1) is included to keep things manageable, rather than because it is essential to the proof. If so, then the same proof might show that as soon as $\epsilon\gg |\lambda_0|^{\frac{1}{2}+\delta}$ for some fixed $\delta>0$ we have $$ F(\lambda_0,k,\epsilon) =\overline{\mathfrak{S}}_\infty(\lambda_0) \Big(\prod_{p\text{ prime}}\mathfrak{S}_p(N)\Big)\epsilon^{d-1}|\lambda_0|^{-1}\big(1+O_{q,\Omega,\delta}(|\lambda_0|^{-\delta'})\big) $$ where the modified constant $\overline{\mathfrak{S}}_\infty(\lambda_0)$ is still bounded above and below by constants depending only on $q$. I would need to read through the proof in more detail to be confident of this last part. 

Morally, any first attack on Waring's problem (e.g. Chapter 2 of Vaughan) works here, but to be rigorous one might modify the argument on the major arcs. If you want to quote an explicit result I suggest Birch; Theorem 1 in Section 7 needs only cosmetic changes to yield the following result: Theorem (Birch) Let $f(x)\in\mathbb{Z}[x_1,\dotsc,x_k]$ have degree $d$, let $g(x)$ be the leading part. Suppose the singular locus of $g$ has codimension $>(d-1)2^d$ in $\mathbb{C}^k$. Let $\nu\in \mathbb{N}$ and let $\mathscr{B}\subset [-1,1]^k$ be a box of side at most $1$. For some $\delta>0$, the number of integer points $x\in P\mathscr{B}$ with $f(x)=\nu$ is $$ C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}P^{k-d}+O_{f}(P^{k-d-\delta}) $$ If for each prime $p$ there is $x$ with $f({x})\equiv\nu$ and $\nabla f(x)\not\equiv 0$ mod $p$, and there is a solution $\bar{x}\in \mathscr{B}$ to $g(\bar{x})=1$ with distance $\geq r$ from the real singular locus of $g(\bar{x})=1$, then $C_{n,f,\mathscr{B}}\gg_{f,r} 1$. Take $\mathscr{B}=\frac{1}{2}\big[(\frac{1}{2s})^{1/d},(\frac{2}{s})^{1/d}\big]^k$ and $P= 2\nu^{1/d}$. If $\nu\gg_f 1$, $k>(d-1)2^d$ and $\sum P_i(x_i)\equiv\nu$ has nonsingular solutions mod $p$ then we deduce that $\sum P_i(x_i)=\nu$ has many solutions in your range. Why does this follow from Birch's work? That paper is about some degree $d$ forms $f_1,\dotsc,f_R$. But actually, after the introduction, we can take the $f_i$ to be general degree $d$ polynomials if we replace $f_i$ by its leading part in the following places: the definition of $f^{(i)}_{j_0,\dotsc,j_{d-1}}$ at the start of Section 2; the definition $V(\mu)$ and $V^*$ in formulae (2) and (3) of Section 3; the definition of $I(\mathscr{C};\gamma)$ in formula (9) of Section 5; and throughout Section 6. In Section 7, Theorem 1 we need to replace $f_i$ by its leading part in the definition of $V^*$ and in the expression $\Phi[f(\bar{x})]$. The theorem above is exactly this in the case $R=1$ of a single polynomial. The argument really does not change. A little thought to see that Lemma 5.1 is still true, that's it. 

The full detail of this is of course a complex matter but I can build out some structure and connect the problem to some powerful tools for you; namely that, like the Collatz conjecture, this structure descends linear combinations of Lucas sequences. The floor function of dividing by two descends the sequences $x_{n+1}=2x_n+1$; e.g.: $0,1,3,7,15,31,63,\ldots$ Which should be fairly obvious. Furthermore if you divide alternate numbers in this sequence by $3$ you have the immediate odd predecessors of $1$ in the Collatz graph; namely $\{1,5,21,85,341,\ldots\}$ so the connection is fairly obvious. Numbers just below any descending sequence converge to the same path. In fact the catchment gets wider the higher up the sequence you go, so e.g. $\{62,61,60\}$ go to $15$ then $\{62,61,60,59,58,57,56\}$ go to $7$ etc. Of course your function will descend these sequences and their neighbourhoods until it hits some highest prime so to build the graph it's necessary to break apart the descending sequences at the prime numbers and graph those upwards to $x^2$ instead of down, connecting the next descending sequence. I happened to choose the Mersenne numbers, and there are likely infinitely many prime examples although like all Lucas sequences of the first kind this is a divisibility sequence and therefore only a number with a prime index can itself be prime. But this isn't generally the case in all of your function's descending sequences. The Mersenne numbers are the Lucas sequence $U_n(3,2)$. You can generate every such descending sequence which your function descends, by the linear combinations of $U_n(3,2)$ with its companion $V_n(3,2)=2,3,5,9,17,33\ldots$ $U_n$ is the sequence $2^n-1$ while $V_n$ is the sequence $2^n+1$ so they converge in $\Bbb{Z}_2^{\times}$ to $\pm1$ giving you a set dense enough in $\lvert\cdot\rvert_2$ that perhaps intuitively hints at them covering a set $\{z_1,z_2\in\Bbb{N}:\lvert z_1-z_2\rvert_2\leq\frac{1}{2}\}$ i.e. having an integrality gap of 2 - the odd numbers. To fully index your descending sequences, and graph the vertices where they stop descending and go up, you need to identify the set of linear combinations of these such that the least value in the sequence is a prime number. To do that, you need the set of primes $p$ such that $2p+1$ is not prime and define the sequence $S_p=a\cdot U_n(3,2)+b\cdot V_n(3,2)$ by setting $b\cdot V_0(3,2)=p$ and choosing $a$ such that $S_{p+1}=2p+1$ That gives you the set of sequences: $S_p=(\frac{p}{2}+1)\cdot U_n(3,2)+(\frac{p}{2})\cdot V_n(3,2)$ Next you need to build the successor relation between these sequences; i.e. from the prime at the base of one, to the next descending sequence via the function $x^2$. A (fairly obvious) observation is that the floor function of an odd square halved is equal to $\frac{n^2-1}{2}$. All odd squares are of the form $4n+1$ so the function $p^2$ will always be followed by at least a division by $4$, so we will always have: $\dfrac{p^2-1}{4}$ before possibly more divisions by $2$. The next part of the exercise is to show that the function $x^2$ totally orders these sequences $S_p(3,2)$. I could go on but you are probably bored (and answering Collatz-related questions can be risky for low-rep users!) Hopefully I have built out a good amount of the structure which others with greater skills than me may be able to take further. Another critical structural note to bear in mind is that once you have eliminated unnecessary structure such as perhaps the even numbers, the leaves of this graph, if there are any, will initially be among the primes $p$ for which $2p+1$ is also a prime since these $p$ are the primes which cannot be descended to down some sequence $S_n$ (as obviously any such descent would stop at $2p+1$ and ascend, if $2p+1$ were prime). But if I were a betting man I would predict that the "unnecessary structure" is actually pretty complex and there is a vast amount to be whittled away, and that in the final construct of this graph, the Mersenne Primes may actually be the leaves of the graph, and that the proof this converges to a cycle for all inputs is largely equivalent to there being infinitely many Mersenne Primes. But that is conjecture. There is a vast array of research into Lucas sequences and numerous algebraic structures underpin any set of linear sequences of them as per the link I gave above. The next part of the exercise I would suggest is to take a look at that structure and find how it determines that the function $p\to p^2$ preorders the sequences $S_p=(\frac{p}{2}+1)\cdot U_n(3,2)+(\frac{p}{2})\cdot V_n(3,2)$
