No, it can be infinite. Start with the function $w=f(z)$ mapping the unit disc onto itself. Let $I_k$ be disjoint closed arcs on the image disc in the $w$ plane. Deform the image region by adding two "horns" on each $I_k$ which go outside and then overelap. If the size of the horns tends to zero as $k\to\infty$, the function will be continuous. 

Just few remarks to Alex's answer. If all $u_1,u_2,v_1,v_2$ are distinct, the function mapping the Riemann sphere on your surface is a rational function of degree $3$. And conversly, every rational function of degree $3$, with simple critical points and distinct critical values, maps the sphere on such Rimemann surface. Up to conformal automorphisms in the domain and in the image, it depends on one parameter, for example the $4$-th cricital point, if we normalize so that three critical points are $0,1,\infty$ and three critical values are also $0,1,\infty$. Then the $4$-th critical value is a quadratic function of this $4$-th critical point, so for each critical value you have two choices for your normalized rational function. All computation can be done by hand, and was actually done in the paper L. Goldberg, Catalan numbers and branched coverings by the Riemann sphere. Adv. Math. 85 (1991), no. 2, 129â€“144. 

To add to the excellent answers of jvp and David Speyer above: Actually Hartog's theorem does even better: Given a domain $U\subset\mathbb{C}^{n{\geq{2}}}$ and a compact $K\subset{U}$ such that $U\setminus{K}$ is just connected, any holomorphic function on $U\setminus K$ extends holomorphically to $U$. Note that we don't need the codimension condition. This is actually a simple consequence of Cauchy's formula in several variables. For algebraic geometry (resp. complex geometry) and dimension $\geq{2}$: The analog of Hartog's theorem is that any regular (resp. holomorphic) function on the complement of an algebraic (resp. analytic) subset of codimension atleast $2$ in a normal algebraic(resp. analytic) variety, extends to the whole algebraic (resp. analytic) variety. I would also like to point out the important difference between the affine (resp. Stein) case and the projective case as perhaps alluded to by jvp above. If $X$ is a projective algebraic variety over $\mathbb{C}$ and you find a holomorphic function $f$ on the complement of a divisor $D$ then you will not be able to extend the function to all of $X$ however hard you try(!) since there are no global non-constant functions on projective varieties (similar statement for compact analytic vars). So to add to jvp's answer (which might seem like hair-splitting but is important IMHO): His second paragraph must refer to a non-projective neighborhood of the contractible curve that he discusses, otherwise the argument is still true but only vacuously! This is because there is no non-constant function to be found on a projective surface on the complement of a contractible curve and hence there is nothing to extend! Moreover, it will not be possible in general to extend holomorphic functions from the complement of divisors whose examples can be easily constructed. So there is no hope in this direction without any local boundedness hypothesis. 

A minimax theorem is a theorem which states that under certain conditions on $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{Y}$ and $f$: $$ \inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}}{\sup_{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{f(x,y)}} = \sup_{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\inf_{x \in \mathcal{X}}{f(x,y)}}$$ All minimax theorems rely strongly on convexity: the sets $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are usually required to be convex subsets of vector spaces, and $f$ to be convex-concave. My question is: of course one cannot expect much without some convexity, but is it possible to get rid of the convexity of the domain in any way? For example, consider the simplest minimax problem: $\mathcal{X}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathcal{Y}$ a convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $f(x,y) = \langle x,y \rangle$ is the usual scalar product. Are there any minimax results in this setting (with of course additional assumptions on $\mathcal{X}$ or $\mathcal{Y}$, but $\mathcal{X}$ should not be assumed to be convex) ? 

The numbers $a_j$ do not have to be algebraic. Theorem. If $a_j,\; 1\leq j\leq n$ are $Q$-linearly independent then $e^{a_jz}$ are algebraically independent over $C(z)$ Proof. Let $$F(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\sum_j c_j(z)x_1^{m_{j,1}}\ldots x_n^{m_{j,n}},$$ where $c_j\in C(z)$, and $(m_{j,1}\ldots,m_{j,n})\neq(m_{k,1}\ldots,m_{k,n})$ for every pair $j\neq k$. Suppose that $$F(e^{a_1z},\ldots,e^{a_nz})=\sum_jc_j(z)e^{z\sum_km_{j,k}a_k}\equiv 0.$$ All exponentials here are distinct, because $a_j$ are $Q$-linearly independent. Then we have a contradiction from the asymptotics in the complex plane: if there is only one exponent of the largest modulus, its growth dominates the rest in certain directions. If there are several, their arguments are different and each dominates in certain direction. Remark. Just noticed that this essentially coincides with ACL's comment:-) 

The answer to 1) is simple. An Hermitean matrix is determined by its eigenvalues and eigenspaces. Assign $r$ distinct eigenvalues ($r$ real parameters). Their eigenspaces are orthogonal lines. One line depends on $n-1$ complex parameters, the next line must be perpendicular to the first, so it depends on $n-2$ complex parameters, and so on. Summing up, we obtain $$r+2((n-1)+...+(n-r))=2nr-r^2$$ real parameters. To check, set $r=n$, we get $n^2$, the real dimension of the space of all Hermitean matrices. Set $n=2,r=1$ we get $3$. The answer to 2) is even simpler, because every Hermitean matrix can be represented in this form. 

Excuse me guys, but I think it is true that the permutation groups $S_m$ will not admit a faithful representation in dimension $n$ if $m>>n$? I can certainly see this for $m>2n$ atleast. So this will give countably many examples of finitely presented groups not admitting injective homomorphism to $GL(n,C)$ as Dmitri wanted in his question (1). My claim can be seen by either an elementary combinatorial calculation on the involution on the respective spaces or by classification of irreducible representation of $S_n$(that they are either the identity, sign or the standard ones). We don't have to invoke any high powered theorem to do this IMHO. Cheers! 

The two papers cited below might be of some interest to you: Theorem 3.3 of (1) says that for a Krull domain $R$, $Cl(R)/Pic(R)$ is torsion iff local class groups are torsion at the maximal ideals. It is also a remark before Theorem 13 of (2), attributed to Chouinard, that any abelian group appears as the Class group of some local Krull domain. So for constructing an example as you want we may choose a local Krull domain $R$ with $Cl(R)$ a free abelian group and try to see if we can manage the image of $Pic$ in $Cl$ to be of finite index. I am unable to construct such an example right away, however its existence seems morally possible to me.

I eventually found the answer to my question. The answer is no: take $\nu$ the uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. Let $\hat{\nu}_n$ be the empirical distribution obtained from $n$ samples of $\nu$. Let $\Gamma$ be the set of all discrete signed measures. It is a convex subset of the set of all signed measures. For $x \in \Gamma$, $I(x) = KL(x,\nu) = +\infty$ so $\inf_{x \in \Gamma}{I(x)} = +\infty$ and $$e^{-n \inf_{x\in \Gamma}{I(x)}} = 0$$ Yet $$\mathbb{P}\left(\hat{\nu}_n \in \Gamma\right) = 1$$ since the empirical distribution is of course discrete. (Note that it is possible to find a topology making the space considered a Polish one, see Dembo and Zeitouni for example.) So topological arguments are needed, at least in the infinite dimensional setting. Still wondering if the result holds in finite dimension though (it does hold in dimension $1$). 

A really neat well known example is as follows: Choose a conic $C_1$ and a tangential line $C_2$ in $\mathbb{P}^2$ and asssociate to a point $P$ on $C_1$ the point of intersection $Q$ of $C_2$ and the tangent line to $C_1$ at $P$. This gives a birational isomorphism from $C_1$ to $C_2$. Identify the curves by this map to get the quotient variety $\phi:\mathbb{P}^2\rightarrow{X}$ with $C:=\phi(C_1)$. Now if there was an embedding of $X$ in a smooth scheme then, there would surely exist an effective line bundle on $X$, say $L$ whose pull back to $\mathbb{P}^2$ will obviously be effective. Let us see why this is a contradiction. Let $L'$ be the pullback of $L$ to $\mathbb{P}^2$. Note that the degrees of $L'|C_1$ and $L'|C_2$ both coincide with the degree of $L|C$ and are therefore equal. But $L'\cong\mathcal{O}(k)$ and therefore the degrees in question are $2k$ and $k$ respectively for $C_1$ and $C_2$. Therefore $k=0$ and $L'\cong\mathcal{O}$, which is non-effective! A contradiction! In view of VA's comment, I give a complete proof here for constructing $X$ as a scheme. In our special case it is a trivial pushout construction: Here I am thinking of $Y$ as $C_1\amalg{C_2}$, $Y'=C$ (the quotient by the birational isomorphism above), and $Z=\mathbb{P}^2$, but the argument is more general provided any finite set of closed points in $Z$ is contained in an affine open set. $X$ will denote the quotient. Claim: Suppose $j:Y\rightarrow{Z}$ is a closed subscheme of a scheme $Z$, and $g:Y\rightarrow{Y'}$ is a finite surjective morphism which induces monomorphism on coordinate rings. Then there is a unique commutative diagram (which I don't know how to draw here, but one visualize it easily): $Y\xrightarrow{j}{Z}$, $Y\xrightarrow{g}Y'$, $Y'\rightarrow{X}$, $Z\xrightarrow{h}X$ where $X$ is a scheme, $h$ is finite and induces monomorphisms on coordinate rings and $Y'\rightarrow{X}$ is a closed immersion. Proof: First assume that $Z$ is affine, in which case $Y,Y'$ are both affine too. Let $A,A/I,B$ be their respective coordinate rings. Then $B\subset{A/I}$ in a natural way. Let's use $j$ again to denote the natural map $A\rightarrow{A/I}$. Put $A'=j^{-1}(B)$ and $Spec(A')=X$. The claim is clear for $X$. Also if $Z$ is replaced by an open subset $U$ such that $g^{-1}g(U\cap{Y})=U\cap{Y}$, $X$ would be replaced by $U'=h(U)$ which is an open subset. Now this guarantees the existence of $X$ once it has been shown that $Z$ can be covered by affine open subsets $U$ such that $g^{-1}g(U\cap{Y})=U\cap{Y}$. But this is obvious in our example. For our example it is also clear from the construction of $X$ that it is actually reduced and irreducible. QED. I hope this is satisfactory.
