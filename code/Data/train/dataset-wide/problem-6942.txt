Perhaps you should look up the following collection of studies, Dornbusch and Edwards (ed.), The Macroeconomics of Populism in Latin America(1991) It is freely downloadable from its official site. Here is the opening paragraph of the Editors' piece 

A thing that bothers me here is the following: the Incentive Compatibility constraint is $$IC: w'p(a') + w(1-p(a')) - 1 \geq w'p(a) + w(1-p(a))$$ $$\implies w'-w \geq \frac {1}{p(a')-p(a)} \tag{1}$$ ...since by assumption $p(a')-p(a) >0$. We are told that we should find that at the optimum, $$x'-w' = x-w \implies x'-x = w'-w \tag{2}$$ Combining $(1)$ and $(2)$, if indeed this is the optimum under the given constraints, we must also have $$x'-x \geq \frac {1}{p(a')-p(a)} \tag{3}$$ But this is an additional, necessary constraint on a priori magnitudes, that must hold if the postulated optimal solution is to be admissible. Even if indeed such a constraint is assumed, in any case, it visibly reduces the generality of the problem (which purports to show something general, i.e. how the risk-neutrality of the agent affects the solution). Nevertheless, let's work this a bit more formally. I will assume that $w, w'$ can be zero, but not negative. This is a maximization problem in normal form with inequality constraints, non-negative decision variables and non-negative multipliers. The full Lagrangean of the problem therefore is (I will compact notation in an obvious way), $$\Lambda = u(x'-w')p' + u(x-w)(1-p') + \lambda\cdot [w'p' + w(1-p') - 1 ]\\ + \mu \cdot [ w'p' + w(1-p') - 1 - w'p - w(1-p)] + \xi w + \xi' w'$$ The essential first order conditions are $$\frac {\partial \Lambda}{\partial w} \leq 0, \;\;\frac {\partial \Lambda}{\partial w} \cdot w = 0$$ and analogously for $w'$. These result in $$\frac {\partial \Lambda}{\partial w} = -u'(x-w)(1-p') +\lambda (1-p') - \mu (p'-p) + \xi \leq 0$$ $$\implies u'(x-w)(1-p') \geq \lambda (1-p') - \mu (p'-p) + \xi $$ $$\implies u'(x-w) \geq \lambda - \mu \frac {p'-p}{1-p'} + \frac {\xi}{1-p'} \tag{4}$$ $$\frac {\partial \Lambda}{\partial w'} = -u'(x'-w')p' +\lambda p' + \mu (p'-p) + \xi' \leq 0$$ $$\implies u'(x'-w') \geq \lambda + \mu\frac {p'-p}{1-p'} + \frac {\xi'}{p'} \tag{5}$$ First note that not both wages can be zero, because the constraints would be violated. Given this, consider the possibility that the $IR$ is binding (so $\lambda >0$). If it is binding, then with not both wages zero, the $IC$ constraint will necessarily be violated. So we conclude that $$\lambda_* = 0$$ and the first-order conditions now become $$u'(x-w) \geq - \mu \frac {p'-p}{1-p'} + \frac {\xi}{1-p'} \tag {4a}$$ $$ u'(x'-w') \geq \mu \frac{p'-p}{1-p'} + \frac {\xi'}{p'} \tag{5a}$$ Now note that if $\xi =0$ (i.e. $w >0$) then $(4a)$ should hold as an equality and with the last term on the right equal to zero. But this would require negative marginal utility which is inadmissible. We also know that not both wages can be zero. So we conclude that we must have $$\xi_* > 0 , w_*=0,\;\;\; \xi'_* = 0,\; w'_* >0$$ and the conditions now become $$u'(x) \geq - \mu \frac {p'-p}{1-p'} + \frac {\xi_*}{1-p'} \tag {4b}$$ $$ u'(x'-w') = \mu \frac{p'-p}{1-p'} \tag{5b}$$ Eq. $(5b)$ implies that $\mu_*>0$ , under a usual utility function specification, which does not give zero marginal utility except at infinity. This in turn means that the $IC$ constraint should hold as an equality. Given that $w_*=0$ this gives $$IC: w'p' - 1 - w'p =0 \implies = w'_* = \frac 1{p'-p} \tag{6}$$ This should ring a bell, because the right-hand-side of $(6)$ is the same as the right-hand-sides of $(1)$ and $(3)$. Namely, if we are assuming a priori that $x'-x = \frac 1{p'-p}$, then the solution we have arrived at validates the claim $x'-w'_* = x-w_*$ Under this additional assumption, we also obtain $$u'(x) \geq - \mu_* \frac {p'-p}{1-p'} + \frac {\xi_*}{1-p'} \tag {4c}$$ $$ u'(x) = \mu_* \frac{p'-p}{1-p'} \tag{5c}$$ Combining, we obtain $$ \mu \frac{p'-p}{1-p'} \geq - \mu \frac {p'-p}{1-p'} + \frac {\xi_*}{1-p'}$$ $$\implies \mu_* \geq \frac {\xi_*}{2(p'-p)} \tag{7}$$ This is admissible. So under $x'-x = \frac 1{p'-p}$, we obtain the solution $$\left \{w'_* = x'-x = 1/(p'-p), w_* =0, \lambda_*=0, \mu_* \geq \frac {\xi_*}{2(p'-p)}, \xi_* >0, \xi'_* =0\right\}$$ 

Let's work such a very simple model. We have a Robinson Crusoe island economy, an isolated individual that lives totally alone. In order to consume something Crusoe must work. Assume for even more simplicity that capital is not needed (say, fruit-gathering by hand). Crusoe does not like to work but he would rather sit relaxed and enjoy the good weather in his island. Apart from the biological necessity to eat something, Crusoe also likes the taste of fruits he gathers. Fruits cannot be stored. So we have a, daily utility function of the form $$U = U(c, \ell), \;\; \ell + L = T$$ $$U_c >0,\;\; U_{\ell}>0,\;\; U_{cc} <0, \;\; U_{\ell \ell} <0,\;\; U_{c\ell} =U_{\ell c} \geq 0$$ The last assumption on the cross-partial seems like the more reasonable one. $\ell$ is leisure and $L$ is amount of work, and $T$ the maximum amount of time that Crusoe can work (say, $16$ hours). We also have a "fruit-gathering" function $$Q = f(L) = AL^a$$ We can reasonably assume that we have decreasing marginal product of labor (due to the body getting tired going up and down all these trees), so $0<a<1$. Since fruit cannot be stored and capital is absent, the only optimization problem that makes sense here is a static one, meaning $c=f(L)$. Then we want to max over $L$ the function $U[f(L), T-L]$. The f.o.c. is $$\frac {\partial U[f(L), T-L]}{\partial L}\equiv G = U_c[f(L), T-L]\cdot f'(L) - U_{\ell}[f(L), T-L] = 0$$ and the s.o.c is $$ \partial G/\partial L = U_{cc}\cdot f'(L) - U_{c\ell}\cdot f'(L) + U_c\cdot f''(L) - U_{\ell c}f'(L) +U_{\ell \ell} <0$$ Given our assumptions, this expression is everywhere negative, so we have our maximum. We want to examine what happens as $A$ in the fruit-gathering function increases. Using the implicit function theorem we have, around the solution, $$\frac {dL}{dA} = -\frac {\partial G/\partial A}{\partial G/\partial L}$$ We know that the denominator is negative, so together with the minus sign in front becomes positive. Therefore $$\text{sign}\left\{\frac {dL}{dA}\right\} = \text{sign}\big\{\partial G/\partial A\big\}$$ $$= U_{cc}\cdot[ \partial f/\partial A ]\cdot f' +[\partial f'/\partial A]\cdot U_c - U_{\ell c}\cdot [\partial f/\partial A] $$ This expression is of ambiguous sign, which is a first indication that things may not be that straightforward after all. To validate the conjecture of the OP we would need to obtain, $$\text{sign}\left\{\frac {dL}{dA}\right\} < 0 \implies U_{cc}\cdot[ \partial f/\partial A ]\cdot f' +[\partial f'/\partial A]\cdot U_c - U_{\ell c}\cdot [\partial f/\partial A] < 0$$ $$\implies U_{\ell c}\cdot [\partial f/\partial A] > U_{cc}\cdot[ \partial f/\partial A ]\cdot f' +[\partial f'/\partial A]\cdot U_c$$ $$\implies U_{\ell c} > U_{cc}\cdot f' +\frac {\partial f'/\partial A}{\partial f/\partial A}\cdot U_c$$ Using the first order condition, we can substitute for $U_c = U_{\ell}/f'$, so $$\text{sign}\left\{\frac {dL}{dA}\right\} < 0 \implies U_{\ell c} > U_{cc}\cdot f' +\frac {\partial f'/\partial A}{\partial f/\partial A}\cdot [U_{\ell}/f']$$ Now $$\frac {\partial f'/\partial A}{\partial f/\partial A} \cdot \frac {1}{f'} = \frac {(a/L)L^a} { L^a} \cdot \frac {1}{(a/L)AL^a}$$ $$= \frac {1}{f} = \frac {1}{c}$$ So $$\text{sign}\left\{\frac {dL}{dA}\right\} < 0 \implies U_{\ell c} > U_{cc} \cdot f'+ U_{\ell}/c$$ and re-arranging while multiplying throughout by $c/U_c$ and using the f.o.c. again, we get $$\text{sign}\left\{\frac {dL}{dA}\right\} < 0 \implies f'\cdot (RRA_c-1) > - U_{\ell c}\cdot c/ U_c$$ where $RRA_c$ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion related to consumption. So we see that if $RRA_c\geq 1$, which is the usual assumption, this inequality is certain to hold and so indeed higher productivity will lead to less time spent working... so why reality does not conform with our theoretical results? But it does. Historically, the amount of time spent working has been declining . The problem with the OP's question is that the phrase "we do as much as we can" is contaminated by framework effects: if what happens around me is people working, say, $10$ hours a day, $5$ days a week, and I work $11$ hours a day, $6$ days a week, I tend to think that, since I exceed the standard around me, "I do what I can", being oblivious to the fact that people used to work $16$ hours a day, $7$ days a week, with perhaps a few days per year off at best. So no, we do not really "do as much as we can". 

The reasons that I say that I do not necessarily endorse the above results is that the report provided, although produced by a "Michael Schuyler, PhD" is not a scientific paper -so we do not know what assumptions and structure does their "TAG" model incorporates. 

There is nothing more to it than the equation $$Y_t - (c_y+v)Y_{t-1} = C^a + I^a$$ This is a linear non-homogeneous first-order difference equation, and it is non-homogeneous because there is a non-zero constant, $C^a + I^a \neq 0$. This is not some "habit in economics", but rather standard mathematical terminology. 

A general result using indirect utility functions, is that expenditure linear in income ("straight-line" Engel curves) is produced if and only if the indirect utility function has the "Gorman-polar form". The original paper is Gorman, W. M. (1961). On a class of preference fields. Metroeconomica, 13(2), 53-56. ...where we read that a linear Engel curve is produced when we have a homothetic utility function (Gorman does not use the word, he writes "homogeneous" and in a footnote, enhances that to "function of a homogeneous function", which is how a homothetic function is defined). But the reverse does not hold:homotheticity is sufficient for linear Engel curves, but not necessary. For example, linear Engel curves are also produced by a utility function that reflects "quasi-linear" preferences, $U(x,m) = u(x) + m$, which are not homothetic. 

Νominal money could be seen as a "conserved quantity" in a similar/analogous sense that we have in physics, under some qualifications and restrictions. I stress that we are talking about the nominal value of money, which is an indisputable quantity and legal tender (the concept of "real" value is an estimated value and hence subject to disagreements etc.) Then if we exclude 1) The central bank/government with the authority of the law 2) The commercial banking system as regards Transactions that have to do with taking or repaying loans 3) Actions that just destroy the physical carrier (say, burn the paper bill) ...then transactions do not alter the amount of nominal money, and in that sense, the nominal value/amount of money is conserved. We exclude 1) because the central bank / government have the power by law to create new money (and destroy existing money, for example "cutting zeros" after a hyperinflation episode). We exclude 2) because commercial banks create money under the "fractional reserve banking" system, while money is destroyed whenever a loan is repaid (the part that has to do with the principal, not the interest). The OP should ask a different question if the OP wants to know about that. We exclude 3) because we can argue that these are not "normal economic transactions". So the system in which nominal money can be considered a "conserved quantity" is a subset of a real world economic system. 

The other excellent answers provided data - mine will provide a simple look into at what stage we are, if Malthusian Theory holds. I replicate here the first graph of the OP: For the graph to be meaningful, "resources" in it must be measured in "number of people that can be sustained by existing resources". To the degree that the amount of resources needed to sustain one person have not really changed -we are talking about survival here, not "good living"-, this normalization does not affect the remarks that follow. Contemplating the above graph, we realize the following: there is an "initial period", during which the growth rate of resources is larger than the growth rate of the population. Then the exponential growth of population starts to show, and its growth rate becomes greater than the growth rate of resources (which is assumed in the Theory to remain constant). And these happen before the "Point of Crisis". What is the implication of this? That there is an initial period where "resources per capita" grow, and then we enter a second stage where "resources per capita" fall as we start to approach the "point of crisis". Note that this has nothing to do with how resources are distributed among humans. So, according to the Malthusian Theory itself, a clear sign that we have started to approach the point of crisis, will be the observation that "resources per capita" start to exhibit a downward trend. This is a general conclusion, even if we assume that resources do not grow linearly but may exhibit exponential growth (albeit weaker than that of the population). Now, the OP reminded us that the rise in population during the 20th century, was immense. Looking at the (excel) figures provided by the OP, in the period $1960-2010$ population rose from 3 bill to 7 bill, i.e. by 134%. On the other hand, as @EnergyNumbers' answer reports, food production per capita grew by 45% between 1961 and 2013. But this means that food production itself grew by 235%: the "resources per capita" figure still grows comfortably. So to the question 

Let's destroy the USD dollar: I am the government of a small, economically and geopolitically unimportant country that has its own currency and a local central bank. I order the local central bank (at gun point, if need be) to lend me dollars. Is there a technical problem to do this? No, this is just an exchange of papers and electronic messages -we can write on them anything we want, especially with a gun in our head. We can attach to these electronic records any three-letter code we want, so why not "USD"? Now I have a bank account with a balance of gazillions and gazillions of dollars- and USD ones, the heavy stuff. I can pay off my public debt, make every citizen rich (or just those that I like), import all the luxuries in the world, buy as much energy as I want, whatever. After all, I will be paying in USD dollars right? I will be wire-transferring from a bank account, an electronic signal that will contain some digits and the code "USD" attached. So let's hear it from the experts: what kind of checks has the international community in place in order to effectively avoid such a situation? And what if, as the most long-lasting counterfeiters know, we were to do this modestly, just a little at the time to help a tad with the local government budget, but without "showing-off riches" to the rest of the world??
