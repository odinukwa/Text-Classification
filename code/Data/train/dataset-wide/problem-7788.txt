A weakly initial set in a category C is a set of objects I of C such that every object a of C has at least one arrow from an object contained in I. The question is then, does Fields have a weakly initial set? This is equivalent to the collection of prime fields being a set. The converse is, is there a (fairly natural) example of a category without a weakly initial set? Aside from obvious things like the discrete category on the objects of a large category. 

I suppose the first one on a number of people's minds is moduli spaces. More specifically, we can in Top form a moduli space (of curves, say), but not in the category of schemes. Thus stacks were born... 

There is an interesting review by Ron Solomon of a paper in this area, which has been featured on the Beyond Reviews blog. In particular, he outlines the broad tactics that people are using in CFSG II, and some of the content that will be going into volume 7. Also, Inna Capdeboscq apparently gave an outline of volume 8, or at least a chunk of it, at the Asymptotic Group Theory conference in Budapest. This was mentioned by Peter Cameron on his blog, sadly with no detail! If anyone can get a whiff of what she said, I would be grateful. EDIT 15 October 2016 I emailed the group-pub mailing list and was told second-hand that Ron Solomon 'has hopes' volume 7 will be submitted next year. EDIT 27 March 2018 Thanks to Timothy Chow in a comment on another answer, here is the link to the published version of Volume 7. So now the countdown to Volume 8 starts... 

In this paper of Mimura and Toda, tables are given for low-dimensional homotopy groups of $SU(3)$, $SU(4)$ and $Sp(2)$. As far as I understand it, Theorem 6.1 gives the generator of $\pi_3(SU(4))$ as $i_\ast \varepsilon_3$. Here $i\colon SU(2) \hookrightarrow SU(4)$ is the inclusion such that $SU(4)/SU(2) \simeq S^5\times S^7$. Here $\varepsilon_3$ should be some known element in $\pi_3(SU(2)) = \pi_3(S^3) = \mathbb{Z}$, but I can't figure out from information in the paper what it is (there are other elements labelled $\varepsilon$, but they live elsewhere with no obvious analogues in this dimension). Any ideas? To contrast, the generator of $\pi_3(SU(3))$ is given $i_\ast\iota_3$, where here $i\colon SU(2) \hookrightarrow SU(3)$ is the inclusion in the top left corner, so that $SU(3)/SU(2) \simeq S^5$, and $\iota_3$ is the isomorphism $S^3\stackrel{\sim}{\to} SU(2)$. I know that the generator of $\pi_3$ of (suitable) Lie groups is given by an inclusion of $SU(2)$ as a subgroup, constructed involving longest roots in the Lie algebra, how do I reconcile this description with that in the first paragraph? 

where CCNPW85 is the ATLAS and BN95 is Breuer and Norton's Improvements to the Atlas (in an appendix of Atlas of Brauer Characters). 

A stack on $Sch$ with the etale topology such that The diagonal is representable, and there is a representable etale surjection from a scheme. 

where they take $S$ to be finitely complete and regular, and (1) to be a regular epimorphism. Bunge and Par\'e call the externalisation of such an internal functor a weak equivalence. Is this the earliest reference to this idea of weak equivalences of internal categories/groupoids? 

Cisinski has some very detailed thoughts here explaining how the homotopy theory of simplicial sets arises naturally using derivators as the free completion of the trivial category by homotopy colimits. That derivators arise he also puts in a very natural way (and of course Heller knew all about). But perhaps all this is contained in the monograph that Tim linked to. 

What this means is that for large categories that are built in a sensible way from small categories, certain universal constructions (like limits) in a 'truncated' version of the large category relative to a universe keep their universal property after being included to a larger truncation. There are also slides of a talk by Low on the same topic that are a bit more ... accessible. I want to point out the concept of "weak universe" suggested at the end of the talk is more or less the same thing as some stage $V_\alpha$ in the cumulative hierarchy where $\alpha$ is some limit ordinal (and also not too different to a model of ETCS - although I'm deliberately being vague here). Such a $V_\alpha$ is a more general (weaker) notion than the $\mathbf{U}$ in your question. No results are given regarding weak universes, but keep them in mind for the rest of this answer. 

It doesn't give an example, and neither does the page on countable choice. So, what are these all-so-common examples? 

Well, if you are happy with everything maximally strict and finite, then you are really looking for a description of the coinverter (a weighted colimit) in the 1-category of finite 2-categories enriched over the cartesian monoidal category of finite 2-categories. See section 2.1 of John Bourke' thesis, in particular pages 13-14 (and work backwards for definitions). In your setup you want the coinverter of the 2-arrow $$ f\colon x \Rightarrow y \colon \ast \to \mathbf{C} $$ where $x$ and $y$ are the constant functors at the named objects, and the natural transformation has as only component the 1-arrow $f$. As Bourke mentions, this can be constructed from coinserters and coequifiers (these are described on previous pages). Since you are dealing with a particularly small class of arrows this may be not as tricky as it first sounds. Note that this is not original to Bourke, and goes back to Max Kelly. 

From work of Pontryagin and Whitney, as I understand it, the homotopy 4-type of $BSO(3)$ is $K(\mathbb{Z}/2,2) \times_{K(\mathbb{Z}/4,4)} K(\mathbb{Z},4)$, where the pullback is along the maps $\mathfrak{P}_2\colon K(\mathbb{Z}/2,2) \to K(\mathbb{Z}/4,4)$ (Pontryagin square) and the obvious $K(\mathbb{Z},4) \to K(\mathbb{Z}/4,4)$. In particular, the $k$-invariant $k_4$ is given by the composite $$ K(\mathbb{Z}/2,2)\to K(\mathbb{Z}/4,4)\to K(\mathbb{Z},5) $$ where the latter map arises from the short exact sequence $\mathbb{Z} \stackrel{\times 4}{\to}\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}/4$ 

One characterisation of submersions that is perhaps too general is that they are the largest class of maps which admits local sections over the pretopology of open sets, and of which all pullbacks exist. Working in a site which actually has all pullbacks, then this class of maps is all maps which admits local sections, and is a sort of 'saturation': given composable $f:x\to y,\ g:y\to z$ if $g\circ f$ admits local sections then $g$ admits local sections. However this misses the idea about sections through every point. Of course, for any concrete category we can talk about sections through every point in the domain, but I'm guessing this is not what you want. 

The consequence of this that I want is that I can choose a point in the complement of every map $X \to X^I$, namely $X < X^I$. For well-orderable $X$ this is a corollary of a restriction of KÃ¶nig's theorem to powers of well-orderable sets in place of arbitrary products of families. I would like to know if there are examples that aren't well-orderable, or otherwise how close to be able to well-order $X$ this gets. Note in particular, that we could take every function $f_i$ to be constant at a fixed point $x\in X$, and so this case implies that we should be able to take a section of $X\setminus\lbrace x\rbrace \to I$ and hence of $p$, for $p$ and $I$ as above. Note that I don't quite have the result that $X$ is a choice object (equivalently, classically well-orderable). I'm not demanding the existence of sections for arbitrary surjections, or more generally for total relation into $X$ (a fine distinction, I'm sure). Edit: $X$ being a choice object is equivalent to saying that there is a choice function from the set $P_+X$ of inhabited subsets to $X$. I am only asking for a choice function on the subset of $P_+X$ given by those subsets of $X$ of strictly smaller cardinality, call it $P^{\lt X}_+X$. 

The Verlinde ring of a (let us say) simply connected simple compact Lie group has as underlying additive group the Grothendieck group of representations of the central extension $\widehat{LG}$ of the loop of $G$ with the 'positive energy' condition. I'm trying to find a concise mathematical definition of the product on this ring, the so-called fusion product. In Freed-Hopkins-Teleman's Loop groups and twisted K-theory III they define an $R(G)$-module structure on this additive group using induction of representations (hence a functorial description). All references I'm reading just mention 'fusion rules', and cite Verlinde, whose 1988 paper is in the journal Nuclear Physics B. Surely we have a more recent discussion along the lines of the FHT construction mentioned above, and not in terms of linear combinations of coefficients of some irreps considered as generators...? 

Before this excerpt, he discusses how any reductive algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$ descends to a split reductive group scheme over $\mathbb{Z}$, such that the original arises via base change. Thus the natural question whether in the category of derived group schemes over $E_\infty$ ring spectra the reductive group descends down $Spec(\pi_0)\colon Spec(\mathbb{Z}) \to Spec(S)$. Has this been achieved/is this known? 

Recall that Easton forcing was introduced to show that the continuum function at regular cardinals could be anything subject to 'the obvious constraints' (monotonicity etc). However, it is a handy method if one wants to add a proper class of sets. My question is why do would we now restrict to using forcing conditions only using regular cardinals (edit: if we wanted only to add class-many sets)? I've had a read through Friedman's Class forcing, and all the (nontrivial) examples given there are variants on Easton forcing, only playing with things like supports and stationarity. I'm not interested in preserving AC, though I suspect that we lose tameness at some point, and hence axioms like powerset may fail to hold.
