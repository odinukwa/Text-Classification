3) The combination of these two facts entails the result for linear groups over fields. Now suppose we have a non-solvable subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\mathrm{GL}_n(R)$ where $R$ is an arbitrary (associative unital) commutative ring. Let $N$ be the nilradical of $R$. It is no restriction to assume that $R$ is finitely generated. So the kernel of $\mathrm{GL}_n(R)\to\mathrm{GL}_n(R/N)$ is nilpotent; thus the image of $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{GL}_n(R/N)$ is not solvable. Thus, we can suppose that $R$ is reduced (i.e., $N=0$). So $\{0\}$ is the intersection of the finitely many minimal prime ideals $P_i$ of $R$. It follows that the image of $\Gamma$ in at least one of the $\mathrm{GL}_n(R/P_i)$ is non-solvable. This reduces to the case of a field. 

I think we only obtain central-by-finite-by-abelian finitely generated groups (I don't claim we get all of them; maybe we only get finite-by-abelian groups and this is what I expect). (I use the convention that a group is P-by-Q if it lies in an exact sequence with kernel satisfying P and quotient satisfying Q.) This is enough to discard $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbf{Z})$, torsion-free nilpotent groups of nilpotency class $\ge 3$, or even many virtually abelian groups such as the infinite dihedral group, but not the discrete Heisenberg group. Actually, a central-by-(finite-by-abelian) f.g. group is either finite-by-abelian or contains a copy of the discrete Heisenberg group so in a sense it's the last guy to rule out (if what follows is correct). 

No, there are no such element. Indeed $H$ is amalgam of the subgroups $\langle x,y,z\rangle$ and $\langle z,w,x\rangle$ over the intersection $\langle x,z\rangle$, which is free (as we see by viewing $\langle x,y,z\rangle$ itself as amalgam of the Baumslag-Solitar $\langle x,y\rangle$ and $\langle y,z\rangle$ over $\langle y\rangle$). [EDIT: my previous argument was mistaken] In an amalgam $A*_CB$, an element of $A$ conjugate to an element of $B$ is actually conjugate to an element of $C$. Thus an element $u_1$ of $\langle x,y\rangle$ conjugated to an element $u_2$ in $\langle z,w\rangle$ is conjugated to an element in the amalgamated subgroup defining $H$, namely $\langle x,z\rangle$. But we can also view $H$ as an amalgam of $\langle w,x,y\rangle$ and $\langle y,z,w\rangle$ and the argument now implies that $u_1$ is conjugated to an element in $\langle y,w\rangle$. So some element of $\langle x,z\rangle$ (conjugate to $u_1$) is conjugated to some element in $\langle y,w\rangle$. Using the first amalgam decomposition of $H$ and its Bass-Serre tree, $\langle x,z\rangle$ acts with a fixed vertex. On the other hand, an element of $\langle y,w\rangle$ not conjugated into the cyclic subgroups $\langle y\rangle$ or $\langle w\rangle$ acts hyperbolic. So every element in $\langle y,w\rangle$ conjugate to $u_1$ is conjugate in $\langle y,w\rangle$ to an element in $\langle y\rangle\cup\langle w\rangle$. Again using this argument in the other decomposition of $H$, we get that every element in $\langle x,z\rangle$ conjugate to $u_1$ is conjugated in $\langle x,z\rangle$ to an element in $\langle x\rangle\cup\langle z\rangle$. Since these element exist, we deduce that that some element in $\langle x\rangle\cup\langle z\rangle$ (conjugate to $u_1$) is conjugated to an element in $\langle y\rangle\cup\langle w\rangle$. By symmetry, we can suppose that some element in $\langle x\rangle$ (conjugate to $u_1$) is conjugate to an element in $\langle y\rangle$. Now I use that if in an amalgam $A*_CB$ an element of $A$ is conjugate to an element of $C$, then it's conjugate to an element of $C$ by an element of $A$. Using the first decomposition of $H$, we deduce that some element of $\langle y\rangle$ (conjugate to $u_1$) is conjugate to an element of $\langle x,z\rangle$ by an element of $\langle x,y,z\rangle$, and by the "every" statement above, we can choose the latter element to belong to $\langle x\rangle\cup\langle z\rangle$. Now in the group $\langle x,y,z\rangle$ (with its explicit presentation with 2 relators), nontrivial powers of $y$ cannot be conjugate to nontrivial powers of $x$ or $z$. Indeed the powers of $x$ survive in the abelianization but not those of $y$ or $z$; on the other hand, nontrivial powers of $y$ are at most exponentially distorted, while $z^{k2^{2^n}}=x^nyx^{-n}z^kx^ny^{-1}x^{-n}$ and thus $z^k$ is partially more than exponentially distorted. So finally the only possibility is $u_1=1$. 

No. Again the 2-torus $T$ is a counterexample. Indeed, first an embedding into $\mathrm{GL}_n$ is given by $n$ characters, hence $n$ pairs $(k_1,m_1)$,... $(k_n,m_n)$ of integers such that the corresponding matrix defines a surjective endomorphism $\mathbf{Z}^n\to\mathbf{Z}^2$. Namely it's conjugate to the embedding $$(t,u)\mapsto \mathrm{diag}(t^{k_1}u^{m_1},\dots,t^{k_n}u^{m_n}).$$ For $\ell$, let $T_\ell$ be the subtorus of $T$ of those $(t,u)$ with $u=t^\ell$. Then it maps to $\mathrm{diag}(t^{k_1+\ell m_1},\dots,t^{k_n+\ell m_n})$ [note that for every $\ell$, $\mathrm{gcd}(k_1+\ell m_1,\dots,k_n+\ell m_n)=1$]. For $\ell_1,\ell_2$, the images of $T_{\ell_1}$ and $T_{\ell_2}$ are conjugate in $\mathrm{GL}_n$ if and only if the $n$-tuple $(k_1+\ell_2 m_1,\dots,k_n+\ell_2 m_n)$ is a signed permutation of $(k_1+\ell_1 m_1,\dots,k_n+\ell_1 m_n)$. For each given $\ell_1$ this can hold only for finitely many $\ell_2$, and hence these fall into infinitely many conjugacy classes. 

(In the case of the identity $[[x,y]^2,z]$ these are of dimension $\le 2$. I'm not sure if one can strengthen the latter conclusion to a more explicit description, but in any case this is beyond what is asked, since the simple case is clear-cut now.) 

No need to specify the ambient ring since every commutative associative ring $I$ (possibly without unit) is an ideal in a ring (namely $I\oplus\mathbf{Z}$ with multiplicative law $(a_1,n_1)(a_2,n_2)=(a_1a_2+n_1a_2+n_2a_1,n_1n_2)$). Now call a X-ring a ring (possibly without unit) satisfying the axioms: associative, commutative, $x+x=x^2=0$ for all $x$. So the free X-ring $R_I$ on the generators $(x_i)_{i\in I}$ has the basis over the field on 2 elements: $(x_J)_{J\in 2^I_0}$, where $2^I_0$ denotes the set of nonempty finite subsets of $I$, and $x_J=\prod_{j\in J}x_j$. If $I$ is finite, then $R_I$ is finite and nilpotent (of length $\le 2^{|I|}$ but I'm lazy to get the best bound). Then $R_I$ is not T-nilpotent when $I$ is infinite. But now let $I$ denote the positive integers, and define $S$ as the quotient modding out by $(x_ix_j)$ whenever $2i<j$. It has the basis $(x_J)$ where $J$ ranges over nonzero finite subset not containing any pair of the form $\{i,j\}$ with $2i<j$. (a) $S$ is quasinilpotent (with $n=2$ as any X-ring) (b) $S$ is not nilpotent (because $x_n\dots x_{2n}\neq 0$ for every $n$) (c) $S$ is T-nilpotent: indeed, consider a sequence $(y_n)$. Write $y_1=\sum_{k=1}^mx_{J_k}$, with $J_k$ nonempty, pairwise distinct and not containing any pair $\{i,j\}$ with $2i<j$; let us show $\prod_{i=1}^p y_k=0$ for large $p$. We can assume $m>0$ since otherwise $y_1=0$. Define $n=\max\bigcup J_k$. Let $\pi$ map $x_J$ to itself if $J\subset\{1,\dots,2n\}$ and map $x_J$ to 0 otherwise, and extend it by linearity; this is a projection, and $y_1y=y_1\pi(y)$ for all $y\in S$. Hence $y_1\dots y_p=y_1\pi(y_2)\dots \pi(y_p)$. Since this product lies in the (finite) subring generated by $x_1,\dots,x_{2n}$, which is nilpotent, it is 0 for large $p$ (say $p\ge 4^n$). 

There are 2 distincts proofs: for $q=p$ and $q\neq p$. When $q=p$: Let $(x_n)_{n\ge 0}$ be generators of $C_{p^\infty}$ with $x_0=1$ and $x_{n+1}^p=x_n$ for all $n$. Define $y_n=x_n-1$ (in the group algebra $\mathbf{F}_p[C_{p^\infty}]$). Then $y_{n+1}^p=y_n$ for all $n$ and $y_0=0$. Define $I_n=y_nA$; then $I_n\subset I_{n+1}$ for all $n$; define $I_\infty=\bigcup I_n$. Then modulo $I_\infty$, every $x_n$ acts as the identity and hence every $\mathbf{F}_p$-subspace of $A$ containing $I_\infty$ is a submodule. Hence if $I_\infty\neq A$, then $A$ contains proper submodules of at most countable index (hence uncountable if $A$ is uncountable). If $I_\infty=A$ and $A$ is uncountable, then $I_n$ is uncountable for some some $n$. If $I_n\neq A$, we are done. Otherwise, $y_nA=A$ and $y_n$ nilpotent force $A=0$, contradiction.
