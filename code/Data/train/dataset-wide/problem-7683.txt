Yes, there is a long history on that subject. It is actually quite subtle point-set topology. The best of the original sources is a series of papers by Peter Booth. A more recent treatment with full details and references is in Section 1.3 of the book "Parametrized homotopy theory" by Johann Sigurdsson and myself. It is available at $URL$ [Added] I'll say something about the choice of "a" category $Top$. As usual, we insist that all spaces in sight are $k$-spaces (compactly generated, but with no separation property). We insist that the base space $B$ be weak Hausdorff. We cannot insist that the function space $Map_B(X,Y)$ also be weak Hausdorff, even when the given spaces $X$ and $Y$ over $B$ are weak Hausdorff. Indeed, when that holds, the map $X\longrightarrow B$ is open if and only if $Map_B(X,Y)$ is weak Hausdorff for all $Y\longrightarrow B$, by a result of Gaunce Lewis. 

Sufficient conditions are known for the existence of an antipode on a bialgebra $A$ over a Commutative ring $R$ that do not assume that $A$ is either commutative or cocommutative. Assume that $A$ is graded, $A_i = 0$ for $i<0$, and $A_0$ is $R$-free. Let $\epsilon\colon A\longrightarrow R$ be the counit (or augmentation). Assume that $\epsilon^{-1}(1)$ is a group under the multiplication of $A$. For each grouplike element $g$, let $A_g = Rg \oplus \bar{A_g}$, where the set $\bar{A_g}$ of positive degree elements of $A_g$ is the set of all elements $x\in A$ such that $$\psi(x) = x\otimes g + \sum x'\otimes x'' + g\otimes x$$ where the $x'$ and $x''$ are both of positive degree. Assume that $A$ is the direct sum over $g\in GLE$ of the $A_g$. Then $A$ has an antipode $\chi$. If $A$ is commutative or cocommutative, then $\chi^2$ is the identity, but not in general otherwise. The conditions are motivated by thinking about the homology of an $H$-space $X$ with coefficients in $R$. 

Sure. Smashing a based space with a spectrum is equivalent to smashing its suspension spectrum with that spectrum. So it suffices to give a nontrivial space whose reduced $K$-homology is trivial. A classical example due to Luke Hodgkin is $Coker J$. See Hodgkin, Luke; Snaith, Victor. The K-theory of some more well-known spaces. Illinois J. Math. 22 (1978), no. 2, 270–278. 

One standard notational convention is that (2) = (E) for unbased spaces $X$, where the brackets mean unbased homotopy classes of maps. This is consistent with the classification theorem that equivalence classes of $n$-plane bundles over $X$ are classified as $[X,BO(n)]$. The classification works for general CW complexes $X$, not just finite ones. The restriction to finite CW complexes to prove that (1) = (2) comes in showing that the Grothendieck group, restricted to elements of virtual dimension zero, is isomorphic to $[X,BO]$. However (E) is perhaps more usually used for the entire generalized cohomology theory whose zeroth term is (2). Then, in modern algebraic topology, it has become standard to focus on reduced cohomology theories defined on based spaces $X$, and the bracket $[X,Y]$ is then understood to mean homotopy classes of based maps. In early literature, $[X,Y]_*$ meant based homotopy classes, but the modern literature prefers confusion, leaving to context which is meant. Thus for unbased spaces, $$KO(X) = KO^0(X) = [X,BO\times \mathbf{Z}] = [X_+, BO\times \mathbf{Z}]_*.$$ The complex analogue is $$K(X) = K^0(X) = [X, BU\times \mathbf{Z}] = [X_+, BU\times \mathbf{Z}]_*,$$ so you absolutely must not use (D). Here $X_+$ is not the one-point compactification of Paul's answer in general, but rather the union of $X$ and a disjoint basepoint. This is the general way to describe unreduced cohomology in terms of reduced cohomology. It has gradually become more standard in algebraic topology to write $KO(X)$ rather than the historical $\widetilde{KO}(X)$ for $[X,BO\times \mathbf{Z}]_*$ when $X$ is based. One point crucial to modern algebraic topology is that generalized cohomology theories are represented by $\Omega$-spectra $E$, which are sequences of based spaces $E_n$ and based (weak) homotopy equivalences $E_n\longrightarrow \Omega E_{n+1}$; of course loop spaces only make sense in the based context. Adams used $K_{\mathbf R}(X)$ and $K_{\mathbf C}(X)$ as synonyms for $KO(X)$ and $K(X) = KU(X)$. That is the context of your (F), but it never really caught on. One can use (B) instead of (A) for emphasis when necessary, to distinguish from algebraic $K$-theory. By abuse, (C) is also sometimes used as synonymous with (A), (B), (E), and (F), although it ought more logically be paired with (1). People sometimes use 'orthogonal' rather than `real' to avoid confusion with Atiyah's Real $K$-theory $KR$ as in Mark's answer. Atiyah's real vector bundles are often called Real vector bundles to avoid confusion, which works Really badly in talks. In answer to Tom and Pierre, the nice paper in mind is ``Vector bundles over classifying spaces of compact Lie groups'' by Stefan Jackowski and Bob Oliver. It exploits the Sullivan conjecture to study (1) when $X=BG$ for a compact Lie group $G$. 

The paradoxical answer is that it is annoying but straightforward to determine $H_k(S_n)$ for particular values of $k$ and $n$, but it is very easy to write down $H_*(\coprod BS_n)$, encompassing all $k$ and all $n$ at once. More generally, if $C$ is the monad on based spaces $X$ determined by any $E_{\infty}$ operad $\mathcal C$, then the Hopf algebra $H_*(CX;\mathbb F_p)$ is an explicitly known functor of the coalgebra $H_*(X;\mathbb F_p)$. Moreover the Bockstein spectral sequence of $CX$ for any prime $p$ is functorially determined by that of $X$, so in principal the integral homology of $CX$ is explicitly determined by the integral homology of $X$. When $X= S^0$, $CX$ is the disjoint union of the classifying spaces $BS_n$, so the homology of all symmetric groups is there as a special case, connected together by multiplicative structure determined by the the evident homomorphisms $S_m\times S_n \longrightarrow S_{m+n}$. User43326 gives a reference for all of this. The answer to 1) and 3) is yes, the answer to 2) is that it is boring but implicit how to write down a table such as yours for small values of $n$ and $k$, it is just not especially interesting to do so, or so it seems to me. It can be left as an exercise to check whether or not 4) is true. 

For any (reduced) cohomology theory $\tilde H^*$, not necessarily ordinary, addition in $\tilde H^r(\Sigma X)$ is induced by the pinch map $\Sigma X \to \Sigma X\ \vee \Sigma X$, using the natural isomorphism $\tilde H^r(\Sigma X \vee \Sigma X) \cong \tilde H^r(\Sigma X)\times \tilde H^r(\Sigma X)$ and functoriality. Here $\Sigma$ is the suspension functor on based spaces. From here, the conclusion follows by stability and naturality. 

Maybe to expand on the relationship between naive and genuine G-spectra, Tom's answer is stated in terms of naive G-spectra, but the actual mathematics, the Segal conjecture, is all about genuine G-spectra. The genuine sphere $G$-spectrum $S_G$ has non-trivial $G$-action and nontrivial $G$-fixed point spectrum. Consider a finite $G$-CW complex. The $G$-map $EG\times X \to X$ induces a map of genuine function $G$-spectra 

Hey Ulrich, you sent me essentially that question by email, and I answered you just now. (Its earlier here, I just got up). So here publicly is the answer I sent you privately. I know the situation. Let me refer you to Section 7 of a recently posted paper by Guillou and myself where certain operads P, Q, and R are defined and related. The operad R is analogous to your example and embedded in operad Q. The operad Q allows monos as well as isos. $URL$ If you can play a trick like that, and you have an analog of our Q that acts on your P-algebras, then you are fine. Otherwise I have no ideas. Dealing with isomorphisms intrinsically gets you into that unreduced situation, and then you have no unit elements in your P-algebras, which means you can't do infinite loop space theory. I would bet that there are operads like P, maybe your P itself, which act on spaces that even have non-Abelian fundamental groups. Just a hunch. Sorry not to be more helpful. Of course, I liked your question. 

There is a second classical paper by Brown himself which abstracts his original paper: Brown, Edgar H., Jr. Abstract homotopy theory. Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 119 1965 79–85. I think you will find that it applies directly. Of course, that was well before model categories. 

[I'm a novice, and this got posted out of order: it answers Bak's question below.] Sure, I can provide that. The cited reference was published in 1995, which was well before details of symmetric or orthogonal spectra were available, so it gives a fair amount of background but only refers to EKMM spectra for a modern category. There is a paper (Mandell, May, Schwede, Shipley) that compares all choices except EKMM, and there are various papers that compare those choices with EKMM, starting with a paper by Schwede. Those papers are maybe more technical than you want. A recent survey paper compares the various approaches philosophically: see Sections 11 and 12 of my paper What precisely are $E_{\infty}$ ring spaces and $E_{\infty}$ ring spectra? Geometry \& Topology Monographs 16(2009), 215--282. That gives references and is fairly independent of Sections 1-10. It starts with a theorem (11.1) of Gaunce Lewis explaining that there is no ideal choice of category: if you assume your category has all the good properties you want, you reach a contradiction. The incompatibility comes when you ask for a homotopically meaningful symmetric monoidal structure on your category of spectra that also has a homotopically meaningful monoidal adjunction $(\Sigma^{\infty},\Omega^{\infty})$ relating spaces and spectra. I'm old-fashioned maybe, but I think spaces are still kind of important. EKMM comes as close as possible to having such an adjunction, with the related advantage that all objects are fibrant and the related disadvantage that the sphere spectrum is not cofibrant. Symmetric and orthogonal spectra have the advantage that they are significantly easier to define and the sphere spectrum is cofibrant. The simplicial version of symmetric spectra has the advantage that it is especially well-suited to adaptation to the motivic world. Orthogonal spectra have the advantage that they are much better suited for equivariant and parametrized generalizations than symmetric spectra. Common features are captured by the web of Quillen equivalences relating not just all known constructions but all possible ``good'' model categories of spectra: there is an axiomatization, due to Shipley; symmetric spectra play a privileged role in the proof. 

I'll give an answer from the point of view of an algebraic topologist, somebody who cares about examples and computations. This all goes way back and has nothing to do with modern generalities. First off, calculationally, algebraic topologists can compute, like to compute, and need to compute mod p homology. It is far more accessible than p-local homology, and it is the focus of completion, not localization, at p. An elementary concrete example of homotopy information invisible to p-localization is that $K(\mathbb Z/p^{\infty},n)$ becomes equivalent to $K(\mathbb Z_p,n+1)$ after $p$-completion. This jacks up to Quillen's equivalence between the $p$-completions of the algebraic $K$-theory space $K(\bar{\mathbb F}_q)$ and $BU$ where $p\neq q$. The homotopy groups of $K(\bar{\mathbb F}_q)$ are $\oplus_{p\neq q} \mathbb Z/p^{\infty}$ in odd degrees and $0$ in even degrees. The homotopy groups of $BU$ are $0$ in odd degrees and $\mathbb {Z}$ in even degrees. Obviously $p$-localization knows nothing whatsoever about this equivalence. Calculationally, the classical Adams spectral sequence converges to the stable homotopy groups of the $p$-completion, not the $p$-localization, of the space (or spectrum) one starts with; that is also true unstably. The Atiyah-Segal completion theorem says that the topological $K$-theory of $BG$ is the completion of $R(G)$ at its augmentation ideal. If $G$ is a $p$-group, this is just $p$-adic completion (on the reduced level). That is a place where use of pro-groups helps calculation, but in most of the calculational applications use of pro-objects is not especially helpful. There are tons of places where $p$-completion is essential to the proof or statement of results: the Sullivan conjecture, the Segal conjecture, the classification of $p$-compact groups, the study of atomic spaces, etc. It is $p$-completion that is relevant to all of these and many more. A technical reason $p$-completion is so convenient is that there are no phantom maps to worry about if one restricts to nilpotent spaces of finite type. That is also true for rationalization but not for localization at $p$. A more sophisticated example is Mandell's algebraization of $p$-adic homotopy theory, the closest analogue we have of the classical algebraization of rational homotopy theory. (The last part of Harpaz's answer concerns this.) I could go on for many pages. The more algebraic topology one learns, the more frequently $p$-completion appears and the more natural it seems. It is worth adding that we do not understand $p$-completion very well for non-nilpotent spaces, where there are several very different notions, none well understood calculationally. This deserves more study. 

Hi Chris, here is just an answer to your "Main question". I hope it responds to what you had in mind. It is Lemma 1.2 in the current draft of "Enriched model categories and presheaf categories", by Bertrand Guillou and myself, which has been totally revised from the version on the archives (which also has this lemma, but I don't remember where). The revision will be posted soon. Context: the paper is all about the projective model structure in enriched categories in general; $\mathcal{V}$ is the enriching category and a $\mathcal{V}$-model category means what you would expect: $\mathcal{V}$-bicomplete and the evident behavior of the internal hom $\underline{M}(-,-)$ wrt cofibrations and fibrations. Tensors are denoted by $\odot$. No claim to originality, but we didn't know a reference. Lemma. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a $\mathcal{V}$-model category, let $M$ and $M'$ be cofibrant objects of $\mathcal{M}$, and let $N$ and $N'$ be fibrant objects of $\mathcal{M}$. If $\zeta\colon M\longrightarrow M'$ and $\xi\colon N\longrightarrow N'$ are weak equivalences in $\mathcal{M}$, then the induced maps $$ \zeta^*\colon \underline{\mathcal{M}}(M',N) \longrightarrow \underline{\mathcal{M}}(M,N)$$ and $$ \xi_*\colon \underline{\mathcal{M}}(M,N) \longrightarrow \underline{\mathcal{M}}(M,N')$$ are weak equivalences in $\mathcal{V}$. Proof. We prove the result for $\xi_*$. The proof for $\zeta^*$ is dual. Consider the functor $\underline{\mathcal{M}}(M,-)$ from $\mathcal{M}$ to $\mathcal{V}$. By Ken Brown's lemma and our assumption that $N$ and $N'$ are fibrant, it suffices to prove that $\xi_*$ is a weak equivalence when $\xi$ is an acyclic fibration. If $V\longrightarrow W$ is a cofibration in $\mathcal{V}$, then $M\odot V \longrightarrow M\odot W$ is a cofibration in $\mathcal{M}$ since $M$ is cofibrant and $\mathcal{M}$ is a $\mathcal{V}$-model category. Therefore the adjunction that defines $\odot$ implies that if $\xi$ is an acyclic fibration in $\mathcal{M}$, then $\xi_*$ is an acyclic fibration in $\mathcal{V}$ and thus a weak equivalence in $\mathcal{V}$. 

It is sensible to restrict to simplicial {\em based} spaces $X_*$ and then apply the functor $P$ levelwise. This is used, for example, to compare $|\Omega X_*|$ with $\Omega |X_*|$ in The Geometry of iterated loop spaces $URL$ 

Tom, not precisely sure what you want. I'm guessing you want to think of a commutative symmetric ring spectrum $R$ and then an $R$-algebra $A$. Without the extra layer, just using an $S$-algebra $R$ (not necessarily commutative), the original source for the algebraic $K$-theory of $R$ is Chapter VI of EKMM, but of course in terms of the $S$-algebras there. The essential point is to have a homotopically well-behaved symmetric monoidal category of spectra in which to work. We now have several: symmetric spectra, orthogonal spectra, and EKMM $S$-modules. Since we have Quillen equivalences that preserve smash products among them, for many foundational purposes it doesn't matter in which category you work. Since that was clear early on, there are many things in EKMM that have not been repeated in full detail in later sources. The differences in detail are not especially significant and comparison theorems are not hard to come by showing that it doesn't matter where you work. (That is emphatically not true when doing multiplicative infinite loop space theory, which is relevant but I think not what you are asking.) Probably there is a good more recent source focusing on symmetric spectra, but I don't know of one. Here is a relevant quote from a nice paper of Blumberg and Mandell (The localization sequence for the algebraic $K$-theory of topological $K$-theory): "We work in the context of EKMM $S$-modules, $S$-algebras, and $R$-modules. Since other contexts for the foundations of a modern category of spectra lead to equivalent $K$-theory spectra, presumably the arguments presented here could be adjusted to these contexts, but the EKMM categories have certain technical advantages that we exploit and that affect the precise form of the statements below."
