The outer shell of the star contains still a lot of hydrogen, after running out of fuel. Elements other than hydrogen are denser than hydrogen. This makes it difficult to get hydrogen to the core of a star, or to the region of hydrogen-burning at least, after the core has been burnt to helium or heavier elements. But the life of a star can be extended in some way, e.g. by adding hydrogen to a white dwarf. This can trigger burning of carbon with a supernova Ia as result. 

The Lagrangian point $L_2$ is very close to the most distant point from Earth with an umbra. $L_2$ is like the radius of the Hill sphere at $r=a\sqrt[3]{\frac{m}{3M}}$ for circular orbits, with $m$ the mass of Earth, $M$ the mass of the Sun, and $a$ the distance Earth-Sun. The ratio $\frac{m}{3M}$ of the Earth and the triple mass of the Sun is almost exactly $10^{-6}$, the cubic root hence $0.01$. The diameter ratio of Earth and Sun is about $1/109$. Therefore the umbra of Earth ends near $92\%$ the distance to $L_2$. The answer to another bonus question would then be: If Earth would be $9\%$ larger in diameter, but with the same mass, its umbra would end almost exactly at $L_2$. Earth's orbit isn't perfectly circular, but the aphel/perihel ratio of about $1.04$ is insufficient to question the result qualitatively. The error of the implicite assumptions $\tan x=x=\sin x$ is negligible at the considered level of accuracy. 

The velocity of the impactor of tens of kilometers per second provides enough energy to heat the impactor and parts of the target to several thousands of Kelvins, so that parts are converted to plasma or to vapor, at least. According to Planck's law the color at these temperatures is white or bluish. According to the Stefan Boltzman law the total emitted energy is proportional to the forth power of the absolute temperature. Hence material which isn't heated to thousands of degrees, and may glow yellowish or reddish is too dim to be noticible in comparison. Since most of the heated ejecta are finely distributed, they cool down rapidly by the emitted radiation, and also after contact with the surface. After cooling there will certainly be some fine dust, which still has to fall back to Moon's surface, but you won't see this on a video from a distance, since it's cooled down and distributed over a wider area. 

The maximum possible radius of a planet is probably unknown to date because current observation techniques not only will give us a biased view of the distribution of planet radii but it is also difficult to tell planets and brown dwarfs apart. However current data suggest a limit of roughly 2 Jupiter radii. 

It comes from angular momentum. Angular momentum is a conserved quantity of physics. That means that the sum of angular momentum of the universe is constant, even though some parts of the universe may transfer angular momentum to other parts. We do not know the total amount of angular momentum of the universe, but from observations we know that it is not uniformly distributed. This explains why celestial objects rotate. If the total amount of angular momentum of the universe would be zero it would be theoretically possible that rotation could cease in the future. However, nobody knows the ultimate fate of the universe, so this is purely speculative. 

The following is a plausibility argument based on the symmetry of an assumed circular orbit of the earth around the sun. The earth's rotational axis is inclined to the ecliptic plane by an angle of about 23.4°. For this reason idealized tidal bulges induced by the sun would travel around the earth's equator at the vernal and autumnal equinox whereas they would travel around circles of 23.4° northern and southern longitude at summer and winter solstice. For symmetry reasons the tidal effects induced by the sun must have either a maximum or a minimum at the equinoxes. From this we conclude that also the combined tidal effects of sun and moon have either a maximum or a minimum at the equinoxes (on average). Given the higher proportion of land to water at 23° northern latitude and a similar proportion at 23° southern latitude compared to the equator, it seems reasonable to assume a maximum at the equinoxes. 

Given a distance of $d_1 = 640~\mathrm{ly}$ for Betelgeuze and $d_2 = 8.6~\mathrm{ly}$ for Sirius the difference in the apparent magnitude for Betelgeuze at distances $d_1$ and $d_2$ that is given by $$m_1 - m_2 = 5~\mathrm{mag} \cdot log_{10}(\frac{d_1}{d_2})$$ is $9.4~\mathrm{mag}$. With magnitude $m_1 = 0.45~\mathrm{mag}$ we get $m_2 = -8.9~\mathrm{mag}$ for Betelgeuze at the distance of Sirius. This is about $860$ times brighter than Sirius ($-1.46~\mathrm{mag}$). It would be visible during daytime 

There has been a lot of speculation, whether it's possible with particle accelerators to create micro black holes. This is only feasible, if space is higher dimensional on very short distances. This kind of black holes would be very short-lived due to decay by Hawking radiation. This kind of black holes could be detected by their decay products. There seems to be no evidence, that black holes have formed in a particle accelerator. In standard 3d space the smallest black hole needs the energy-equivalent of more than $10^{19}\mbox{GeV}$ of the Planck mass of about $20\mu\mbox{g}$ to form. That's far beyond the energy a particle collider can focus onto a single particle collision. Even the most energetic cosmic rays are several orders of magnitude below the needed energy. LHC provided up to 8 TeV (8,000 GeV) for proton-proton collisions, scheduled are 13 TeV for the upgrade. That's 15 orders of magnitude below a smallest 3d black hole, but might allow short-lived black holes for higher-dimensional space. This way LHC can constrain the structure of space on short distances. 

At the present time this doesn't hold for the observable universe, since the observable universe is only a tiny fraction of the surface of the 3-sphere (assumed it's a sphere at all). The observable universe is flat within a 0.4% error. Based on this, we are moving away from each other. And the universe is expanding. So even if it would be curved, we would move away from each other. Only in a future Big Crunch scenario, we would eventually move towards each other. Finite flat cyclic spaces can be constructed, but there is no significant hint, that the universe is of such a shape, or any other non-trivial topology. 

In the opposite direction (RA= 07h 25m 31s ± 10s, +26° 57′ ± 20′, J2000.0, seen from Earth) of the positive horn of the Wow!-signal (RA= 19h 25m 31s ± 10s, −26° 57′ ± 20′, in J2000.0 coordinates), Iota Geminorum, aka Propus, (RA= 07h 25m 43.6s, +27° 47' 53") is within a 3-sigma error ellipse (1.26 sigma in RA, 2.54 sigma in Dec, 2.84 sigma total error). However, this doesn't reveal, whether the signal pointed to anywhere.
