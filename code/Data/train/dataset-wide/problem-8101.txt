You are right, it is not true. Take $ f(x)=-1/\log x $ for $ 0 < x < 1/2 $, then extend to an odd function on $ (-1/2,1/2) $, set $f(0)=0$ and extend to the whole interval continuously. Then $g(0)=+\infty$, so $g$ can be neither continuous nor bounded. 

Yes, this is correct. Suppose that $$f(w)=F\circ\Psi(w)=R(w)+S(w),\quad 1<|w|<r$$ where $R$ is the regular part and $S$ is the singular part, and $r>1$. The singular part is convergent in $\Delta:=\overline{C}\backslash\{ z:|z|\leq 1\}$ (by definition of Laurent series) and $R$ is rational, so $f$ is meromorphic in $\Delta$. If $R$ has $m$ poles, then $f$ has $\leq m$ poles in $\Delta$. As $\Psi$ maps $\Delta$ onto $\overline{C}\backslash E$, biholomorphically, we conclude that $F=f\circ\Phi,\; \Phi=\Psi^{-1}$ has a meromorphic continuation to $\overline{C}\backslash E$, with $\leq m$ poles. This proves the statement, as every meromorphic function on the Riemann sphere is rational. 

Yes. I assume that by "compact surface diffeomorphic to a closed annulus" you mean a bordered surface. Then by definition of a bordered surface, each boundary component has more than one point. Now an open Riemann surface homeomorphic to an annulus is conformally equivalent to $\{ z: r<|z|<R\}$, where $0\leq r<R\leq+\infty$. If each boundary component is not a point, we have the honest annulus with $r=1,R<\infty$. That a neighborhood of a puncture is not conformally equivalent to a neighborhood of the non-degenerate boundary component is a consequence of the elementary theorem on the removable singularity. EDIT. Let me add some detail. The punctured annuli are characterized by the property that the extremal length of the family of all homotopically non-trivial curves is zero. On the other hand, if we have a bordered Riemann surface, homemorphic to a non-degenerate annulus, we can estimate this extremal length from below. To do this, we put on our annulus some conformal metric, in which the length of the boundary components is not zero. In your case, the conformal structure is defined by a diffeomorphism. Just pull back the Euclidean metric on $1\leq |z|\leq R$ by your diffeomorphism. For the definition and properties of extremal length, see any of the two books of Ahlfors, Conformal invariants or Lectures on quasiconformal mappings. An alternative proof can be obtained by referring to Kwak's theorem, which is the generalization of the removable singularity theorem to maps between Riemann surfaces. (Ann. Math., 90 (1969) 9-22, or S. Lang, Introduction to complex hyperbolic spaces, Springer, 1987.) 

You do not tell the crucial thing: how large is $|f'(0)|$. There is no simple expression for coefficients or any other simple expression for $h$, even when $f$ is quadratic polynomial $\lambda z+z^2$. However the global behaviour of $h$ has been be studied a lot, with remarkable results. In the following description, I assume for simlicity that $f$ is a polynomial. If $|f'(0)|<1$, $h$ is analytic in a neighborhood of $0$. It has an analytic continuation to the immediate domain of attraction of $0$, the boundary of this domain is the natural boundary for $h$, and the boundary behaviour of $h$ is relatively well understood. If $|f'(0)|$ is a root of unity, the equation has no solution, even as a formal series. If $|f'(0)|=1$ but not a root of unity, a formal power series $h$ exists. Let $f'(0)=e^{2\pi i\alpha}$, then everything depends on the fine Diophantine properties of $\alpha$. For quadratic polynomial $f$, there is a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of $\alpha$ for $h$ to be analytic in a neighborhood of $0$ (Yoccoz got a Fileds medal for this). When analytic, its maximal domain of analyticity is the so-called Siegel disc, and $h$ maps this Siegel disc onto a round disc bijectively. When $|f'(0)|>1$, $h$ exists but its analytic continuation is not single valued. However the inverse of $h$ has a nice property: it is an entire function of finite order. This result is due to Poincare and Valiron. For the introduction to the properties of this function see P. Fatou, Sur les equations fonctionnelles, in 3 parts, available on $URL$ and G. Valiron, Fonctions analytiques, Paris, Press Universitaires, 1954. For the case $|f'(0)|=1$, see the work of Yoccoz. It follows from this brief description that there can be no simple expression for $h$ (whatever polynomial $f$ of degree at least $2$ you use). It is easy to obtain a recurrence for coefficients, but it is very complicated, and can hardly be used to study $h$. One exception is the work of Siegel on the case $|f'(0)|=1$. he was able to show that the radius of convergence of the power series is positive for certain $\alpha$ by a kind of direct analysis of this recurrence.

Yes, and this is called WKB method by physicists and Green-Liouville method by mathematicians. The idea is to approximate Airy's function itself, and then locate its zeros by an elementary use of Rouche's theorem. To approximate Airy's function, you rewrite the differential equation as an integral equation, and solve it by successive approximation. For details, see, for example Olver, Asymptotics and special functions. Remarks. It helps to know in advance that all these zeros are real. This is because they are simply related to eigenvalues of a self-adjoint boundary value problem for the Airy equation with boundary conditions $y(0)=y(+\infty)=0$. 

Function $f(z)=(1-z)^\alpha$ with $\alpha=-1+\epsilon$ is zero-free in the unit disk, and its coefficients satisfy $a_n\sim cn^{-\alpha-1}=cn^{-\epsilon}$. Setting $u=\log|f|$, we obtain, using Parseval, $$\int_{|z|<1}e^{2u}d\lambda=\int_{|z|<1}|f|^2d\lambda=\sum_n\frac{1}{2n+1}|a_n|^2<\infty.$$ So your trivial estimate is close to the best possible, at least the order cannot be improved. 

Here is a counterexample to your statement for $n=1$. Let $D=\{ x+iy:|x|<1,|y|<\pi/2\}$. Functions $u_1(x,y)=e^x\cos y$ and $u_2(x,y)=e^{-x}\cos y$ are harmonic. Their minimum is $e^{-|x|}\cos y$ which is equal to $1$ at $0$, and the maximum on $\partial D$ is $e^{-1}<1$. It remains to notice that $\exp(u_1)=|\exp\exp z|$ and $\exp(u_2)=|\exp\exp(-z)|,$ so for $f(z)=\exp\exp(z)$ and $g(z)=\exp\exp(-z)$ your statement does not hold.

A stronger statement is true. There are no probability measures $\mu,\nu$, other than $\delta$-measures which satisfy $\mu\star\nu=\delta$. 

One natural property which immediately comes in mind is that the point evaluatons must be continuous. What else? EDIT: 1. On my first question, I want to add that other topologies were also studied. For example, pointwise convergence (Montel, Keldysh and others). Still we probably all feel that the standard topology is the most natural one.

In your example, everything is easy to calculate. Use the fact that your $f$ is a composition of $f(z)=z+1/z$ and $h(z)=z^2$. The plane is partitioned into $8$ regions by the coordinate axes and the unit circle. Each region corresponds to a sheet over upper or lower half-planes. The sheets are connected in the same way as the regions in the $z$-plane. You found the critical points incorrectly: $0$ and $\infty$ are missing. In general, a rational function of degree $4$ has $6$ critical points. The same method works in general (but in practice becomes complicated for functions of higher degree). You find critical points and critical values. Then make convenient cuts between critical values to break the sphere into simply connected regions. Then find out how components of the preimage of these regions tile the sphere of the independent variable. In your example, critical values are $\pm1$, $0$ and $\infty$. So it is reasonable to cut the image sphere into upper and lower half-planes. Finding the components of preimage of these half-planes is simplified by the fact that your function is a composition of two simpler functions. In general, an approximate calculation is sufficient to see how the components of preimage fit together. EDIT. In the classical literature, they cut the image into two hemispheres by drawing a Jordan curve passing through all critical values. This defines a cell decomposition of the image sphere. Then they take the full preimage of this cell decomposition, or the full preimage of the dual call decomposition. In the second case one obtains an embedded bipartite graph (1-skeleton of the preimage cell decomposition). This graph is called the line complex; it permits to visualize the monodromy. It shows you how the half-sheets are pasted together. Of course everything depends on the choice of the Jordan curve, and there is no canonical way to choose it. Once it is chosen, the line complex can be computed if you can solve the equation $f(z)=a$ numerically. The line complex is what replaces the dessin d'enfant in the case of more than 3 critical values.
