Fix a scheme $S$, a group scheme $G/S$ (let us say smooth, maybe even affine with some finiteness conditions if you like), and suppose I have some other $S$-scheme $P$ with a right $G$-action. We want to investigate the question of whether $P$ is a $G$-torsor (in the fppf topology). If I understand correctly, then since $G$ is smooth it is equivalent for $P$ to be a torsor in the etale topology, which is a priori a relatively strong condition. On the other hand, an a priori weaker statement is that it be a torsor in the fpqc topology. My question is: suppose I can find an fpqc (but not finitely presented) cover $\{S_i \rightarrow S\}$ with $P\times_S S_i \rightarrow S_i$ isomorphic to the trivial $G\times_S S_i$-torsor. Are there circumstances under which I may conclude that $P$ is in fact an fppf torsor? One (perhaps silly) example is if I have $S$ equal to the spectrum of some small field $k$ with an interesting Galois group, and I am able to find some huge complicated transcendental extension $K/k$ over which $P$ becomes a trivial torsor. Under what conditions does this imply the existence of a finite separable extension over which $P$ becomes a trivial torsor? 

In the theory of automorphic representations one says that G satisfies a "multiplicity one" property if every cuspidal representation occurs with multiplicity one in $L^2(G(F)\backslash G(A))$. One also says that G satisfies "strong multiplicity one" if a cuspidal representation is uniquely determined up to isomorphism by its behaviour at cofinitely many places of F. My question is: does the latter always imply the former (as the name would suggest), and is there a decent reason? This question was prompted while thinking about Jacquet-Langlands, whose proof (via the trace formula) seems to give multiplicity one as a by-product and whose statement also directly implies strong multiplicity one (for inner forms of GL2 using the result for GL2 itself). However, I didn't see any way to deduce multiplicity one directly from the usual statement. I also can't see how strong multiplicity one for classical modular forms should directly imply the q-expansion principle (which I guess is roughly the same as multiplicity one). Apologies if I'm missing something extremely obvious on this dozy Sunday evening. Thanks, Tom. 

In principle $\textrm{End}(X)$ could have two elements, $\textrm{id}_X$ and $0_X$. If it has only one element, then $\textrm{id}_X = 0_X$, so for all $f : X \to Y$, $f = f \circ \textrm{id}_X = f \circ 0_X = 0$. Similarly, for all $g : Z \to X$, $g = \textrm{id}_X \circ g = 0_X \circ g = 0$. Thus $X$ is both initial and terminal. This argument works in any category with a reasonable notion of zero morphism, not just preadditive categories. 

A Grothendieck topology by definition consists of sieves – what Johnstone calls a sifted coverage – whereas a Grothendieck pretopology in any non-trivial case will contain a non-sieve. (Recall that $\lbrace \textrm{id} : X \to X \rbrace$ is always a covering family for $X$, but it is a sieve if and only if there are no morphisms $Y \to X$ for any $Y \ne X$.) Thus, in any case of interest, no topology is a pretopology and no pretopology is a topology. But siftedness is not the key difference between topologies and pretopologies. The key difference is saturation: as you are already aware, it is possible to add covering families to a pretopology without changing the category of sheaves. One can define the non-sifted analogue of a topology as a family of sinks satisfying the following axioms: 

Suppose I have a smooth non-proper algebraic variety $X/\mathbb{C}$. A vector bundle with flat connection (``differential equation'') on $X$ extends, as was noted by Grothendieck, to a coherent crystal on the infinitesimal site of $X$, realising an equivalence between these two types of object. Deligne's comparison of differential equations on $X$ and $X^{an}$ leads one to restrict one's attention to the subcategory of differential equations on $X$ with regular singularities along the boundary divisor of a good compactification of $X$. My question: is there a clean way to describe this category as a subcategory of the category of crystals on $Inf(X)$? My guess (fear?) is the answer might have something to do with log-geometry, but I know very little about such things so would also appreciate a good reference suggestion if indeed it is the required tool. 

You can always map $(T,h)$ to the trivial Shimura datum and then this into the Siegel one. I assume this isn't what you want however. May I therefore modify the question to ask whether a zero dimensional variety can be embedded in a Siegel variety. I.e. You want to know if all zero dimensional Shimura varieties are of Hodge type. I think this is certainly false and can give two quick reasons. 1) every Hodge type datum has weight defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ and has compact centre modulo the image of this weight. In general neither condition need hold for a zero dimensional Shimura datum. 2) consider the 'cyclotomic' Shimura datum $T=\mathbb{G}_m$ and $h(z) = z\bar{z}$. Any representation of T will induce a hodge structure of even weight but if it admits a Siegel embedding then this must yield a representation giving the weight 1 Hodge structure defining an abelian variety. 

In more detail: let $P = y D$. Then $\mathrm{Hom}(y C, y D) \cong \mathcal{T}(C, D)$, and if we compose with the standard Yoneda isomorphism we get an isomorphism $y D \cong y D$, natural in $D$. The Yoneda embedding $y : \mathcal{T} \to [\mathcal{T}^\mathrm{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$ is fully faithful, so this determines an automorphism of the identity functor on $\mathcal{T}$. Conversely, suppose $\theta : \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}} \Rightarrow \mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{T}}$ is an automorphism. Then we can compose it with the Yoneda embedding and use functoriality of $\mathrm{Hom}$ to get a new natural bijection $\mathrm{Hom}(y C, P) \cong P (C)$: explicitly, it is the map defined by evaluating $P$ at $\theta_C$. 

However, $$\check{H}{}^0 (U, \mathscr{H}^n (\mathscr{F})) = 0 \text{ for all } n \ge 1$$ and so the comparison homomorphisms $\check{H}{}^* (U, \mathscr{F}) \to H^* (U, \mathscr{F})$ are isomorphisms in degrees 0 and 1 (and a monomorphism in degree 2). You can find the above argument as Theorem 8.27 in [Johnstone, Topos theory]. An alternative argument goes via the classification of $\mathscr{F}$-torsors – this relies on the fact that there is an easy identification of $\check{H}{}^1 (U, \mathscr{F})$ and the set of isomorphism classes of $\mathscr{F}$-torsors over $(\mathcal{C}_{/ U}, \tau_{/ U})$. 

Here's a simple observation: the category of commutative monoids has an object that is both initial and terminal (just like the category of groups or abelian groups), so it cannot be cartesian closed. Indeed, if a cartesian closed category $\mathcal{C}$ has the property that $0 \cong 1$, then $$\mathcal{C}(X, Y) \cong \mathcal{C}(1, Y^X) \cong \mathcal{C}(0, Y^X) \cong 1$$ and so $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to the trivial category with one object and one morphism. 

There is George Hart's online Encyclopedia of Polyhedra, which is not a database but is very likely something you will want to consult. Also not a database, but something you should surely know about if you intend to create one, is the software program called Great Stella. There is a free version and a commercial version (use google). Originally intended to allow to you to create stellations (as for example "The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra" of Coxeter et al) for any polyhedron, and visualize, generate nets, duals etc, this program is now much larger containing information about and the ability to manipulate literally hundreds of polyhedra including Platonic, Archimedean, Kepler-Poinsot, convex prisms and antiprisms, Johnson solids, "near misses (of Johnson solids)", Stewart toroids, compounds, geodesic domes, all uniform polyhedra, zonohedra, Waterman polyhedra, Bruckner polyhedra, rectangular isohedra, duals, nets, facetings, stellations, and much more. 

Closely related: what is the smallest known composite which has not been factored? If these numbers cannot be specified, knowing their approximate size would be interesting. E.g. can current methods factor an arbitrary 200 digit number in a few hours (days? months? or what?). Can current methods certify that an arbitrary 1000 digit number is prime, or composite in a few hours (days? months? not at all?). Any broad-brush comments on the current status of primality proving, and how active this field is would be appreciated as well. Same for factoring. 

There is no difference for $\kappa = \aleph_0$. The point is that you can build colimits for filtered diagrams using just colimits for chains. 

By Lambek's theorem, any initial algebra for an endofunctor $F$ has the property that its structural morphism $\alpha : F A \to A$ is an isomorphism. So we seek an object $A$ such that $P P A = \Omega^{\Omega^A} \cong A$. However: Proposition. If a topos $\mathcal{E}$ contains an object $A$ such that $P A$ is a subquotient of $A$, then $\mathcal{E}$ is a degenerate topos (i.e. $0 \cong 1$). Proof. This is Proposition D4.1.8 in [Johnstone, Sketches of an elephant]. 　◻ So, suppose that $A \cong P P A$. Clearly, $A$ is a subobject of $P A$ via the singleton operator $\lbrace \cdot \rbrace_A : A \to P A$, so this isomorphism exhibits $P P A$ as a subquotient of $P A$, which by the proposition implies our topos is degenerate. That said, $\Omega$ is a bit special. The general form of Cantor's theorem for function-sets is known to fail in toposes; for example, in the effective topos, if $N$ is the natural numbers object, then $N^N$ is a subquotient of $N$. There are also cartesian closed categories (hence toposes via Yoneda) containing an object $A$ such that $A \cong A^A$ (and hence $A \cong A^{A^A}$).
