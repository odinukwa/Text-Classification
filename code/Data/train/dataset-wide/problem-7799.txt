You can somewhat lift the algebraic closedness assumption: You have to allow an auxillary ring (actually, division algebra) to act equivariantly on both representation and tensor over it. Such a decomposition should hold whenever one of the groups has semi-simple representation category (the division rings in 1 are endomorphisms of simples). Then, the decomposition can be made canonical precisely up to choosing representative simple objects. If $V$ is a $G \times H$-rep, and $\rho$ are representative simples for $G$, then the natural map $$ \bigoplus_{\rho} \rho \otimes_{D_\rho} Hom_G(\rho, V) \to V $$ with $D_\rho = End_G(\rho)$ will be an isomorphism of $G \times H$-modules. (Conversely, given applying such a decomposition to $k[G]$ viewed as $G \times G$-module one would have to recover a representative set of simples.) For symmetric groups (in char. $0$), the endomorphism rings of simples are just the field (i.e., the simples remain irreducible over the alg. closure), so in particular you get such decompositions. Moreover, there are explicit representative simples that one can write down (the Specht modules). I don't know of the combinatorial theory to say if this gives any sort of satisfactory answer to your question 3. 

Restricting to Aff is certainly enough, but Aff isn't small (there are e.g., polynomial algebras on arbitrary sets). If your DM stack is finitely presented over $k$ (which is probably good to include in the definition, to avoid these issues), then it is determined by it's restriction to finitely-presented affines (which is essentially small). Without some finiteness hypothesis, no set of finitely-presented algebras can suffice (even for affine schemes, nevermind DM stacks). (And I suppose no small category of test objects can suffice: Take Spec of a field generated by a set of cardinality larger than that of global sections of any of your test schemes.) The set you give is insufficient even for smooth varieties over an alg. closed field: you will have a morphism whenever you have an (arbitrary) map on $k$-points. 

$Fl(V)$ is a very geometric object over $X$, so we might as well ask that we actually have a formula for $E^*(Fl(V))$ in terms of $E^*(X)$. If $E^*$ is "reasonable" (i.e., has Chern classes giving rise to a "projective bundle formula") then iteratively applying the projective bundle formula will give such a thing, and in fact show that $E^*(X)$ is a direct summand of $E^*(Fl(V))$. (My favorite:) There's a nice way of strengthening Condition 1' that also holds in all reasonable cases, and that looks rather natural. You can ask that $Fl(V) \to X$ behave like a "covering", i.e. that (Condition 2:) $$ E^*(X) \to E^*(Fl(V)) \to E^*\left(Fl(V) \times_X Fl(V)\right) $$ is an equalizer diagram. (So not only is pullback injective, but you can identify its image...) (In fact, in reasonable cases it'll be a split equalizer diagram, related to the direct summand thing above.) 

This is not a helpful answer to your main question, but merely a negative answer to your "In particular..what happens.." question. But, the general idea may be helpful in figuring out what more precise things (weaker than Keller's result) would be reasonable to ask for. $\newcommand{\RR}{\mathbb{R}}\newcommand{\RHom}{\mathrm{RHom}}\newcommand{\pt}{\mathrm{pt}}\DeclareMathOperator{\deg}{deg}\newcommand{\RGamma}{R\Gamma}\renewcommand{\mod}{\text{-mod}}\newcommand{\C}[1]{C^\bullet(#1)}$ Since I'll lapse into this notation anyway, let me make it explicit: Identity $\gamma_M$ with the functor $$ \RGamma(M, -)\colon D \to \C{M}\mod $$ where by $\mod$ I'm implicitly working in a dg-setting. At some point below, I'll assume that $N$ is compact oriented of dimensions $n$. (This is not strictly necessary, but allows me to avoid extra notation.) Claim: Suppose that $M$ is simply connected, $\dim M \geq 2$, and that $i \colon N \hookrightarrow M$ is not the identity. Then, the functor $\gamma_M \colon D= \langle \RR_M, i_* \RR_N \rangle \to D_{A_M}$ is not fully faithful. Fuzzy Remark: Before sketching an argument, here's a "philsophical" remark about why things will go wrong: The category $D_c(M)$ feels the topology (or maybe even geometry) of $M$. In particular, it has a Proper Base-change Theorem saying something like $q^* p_! = (p')_! (q')^*$ where the maps take part in a fiber-square of (actual) topological spaces. The category $D_{A_M} = \C{M}\mod$ feels only the homotopy theory of $M$. You should expect a Base-Change Theorem in this context, but now with a fiber-square of homotopy types -- more correctly, a homotopy fiber-square. A simpler sort of 'no go' result that this heuristic implies: Suppose you had wanted to include two sub-manifolds $i_k\colon N_k \hookrightarrow M$, $k=1,2$. The $\C{M}\mod$ images would be unable to tell them apart if the $i_k$ were homotopic -- e.g., the inclusion of any two points. While the constructible theory would certain care whether the two points were the same or not. Sketch of Claim: To see this, note that $$ \RHom_{D_c(M)}(i_* \RR_N, i_* \RR_N) = \RHom_{D_c(N)}(i^* i_* \RR_N, \RR_N) = \RHom_{D_c(N)}(\RR_N, \RR_N) = \C{N} $$ while Sub-Claim: Letting $\stackrel{h}\times_M$ denote the homotopy fiber product, $$ \RHom_{A_M}(\gamma_M(i_* \RR_N), \gamma_M(i_* \RR_N)) =\RHom_{\C{M}}\left(\C{N}, \C{N}\right) \approx C_{\bullet}\left(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N\right)[-n] $$ Assuming the sub-claim: to conclude it suffices to produce homology classes on $\Omega M$ in arbitrarily positive degrees, whose images under the composite $$ H(\Omega M) \to H_*(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N) \to H_*(\Omega (M/N)) $$ are non-zero. I think the following should do this upon filling in the details: Equip $M$ with a base-point in $N$, take some non-zero element of $\pi_i M$, with $i \geq 2$, that remains non-zero in $\pi_i (M/N)$. Use it to produce an $(i-1)$-homology class on $\Omega M$, and then take its Pontrjagin products. Sketch of sub-claim: Underlying the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence is the statement that, letting $\boxtimes$ denote derived co-tensor of co-modules over a co-algebra, $$ C_\bullet(N) \boxtimes_{C_\bullet(M)} C_\bullet(N) \approx C_\bullet(N \stackrel{h}\times_M N) $$ Poincare duality gives an equivalence $\C{N} \approx C_\bullet(N)[-n]$ of $\C{M}$-modules (or $C_\bullet(M)$-comodules). It remains to identify $$ \RHom_{\C{M}}(\C{N}, \C{N}) \approx C_\bullet(N) \boxtimes_{C_\bullet(M)} \C{N} $$ by term-wise identifying the co-simplicial cobar constructions on both sides. Example: Note that if $N = \pt$ the sub-claim is a familiar statement in Koszul duality: That for $M$ simply-connected $\RHom_{\C{M}}(\RR,\RR) \approx C_\bullet(\Omega M)$. In certain cases, e.g. $M = S^{2k+1}$, you can just see it. As an aside: $C_\bullet(\Omega M)\mod$ knows about all locally-constant things, not just local systems finitely-buildable from the trivial one. (But will run into the same issues if you try to include submanifolds without explicitly adding in extra generators for the strata.) Remark: Though $\gamma_M$ is not fully-faithful here, it does get the maps into/out of $\RR_M$ right. Logic as above shows that $$ \RHom_D(\RR_M, i_* \RR_N) = \C{N} = \RHom_{\C{M}}(\C{M}, \C{N}) $$ and then Verdier Duality (for $D_c(M)$) + something like Grothendieck Duality (for $\C{M}$) give the other direction as well. 

Another perspective that may help here comes from Bayesian statistics. You can model the outcome of competition between any two players using an unknown strength variable (say , $S_i$ ). Then, define: 

You can model the arrivals as a poisson distribution with different arrival rates λi for each one of your sources. $f(n_i;\lambda_i) = \dfrac{\lambda_i^{n_i} e^{-\lambda_i}} { n_i!}$ You can then assume that the arrival rates are random draws from a gamma distribution which would let you pool information across all your data sources. $\lambda_i$ ~ $\Gamma(k,\theta)$. Assume suitable distributions for $k$ and $\theta$. You can then construct the posterior distribution for $\lambda_i$, $k$ and $\theta$. The gamma distribution will help you 'shrink' your estimates for $\lambda_i$. In other words, if the frequencies of arrival is too low then it will be nudged a bit higher and if it is too high it will be nudged a bit lower depending on the data you have. Basically, the pooling of information will enable you to arrive at more robust estimates of the arrival rates. Estimate these parameters conditional on the data you observe using standard Bayesian methods. Once you have the estimates you can find out the probability that source $i$ is ranked the highest etc from the estimates. Do note that if the observed arrivals are of order of magnitude different from one another then you would be better of simply ordering on the actual arrival numbers as the bayesian computation above would not give any different results. Google the following terms to get some traction: hierarchical bayesian models, gibbs sampler, mcmc sampler, conjugate priors etc. 

You can use the logistic/normal distribution to model the above probability (like how the wiki page for ELO mentions. See the link provided by Joel). As you pointed out, in the degenerate case, estimation of the strengths among all players in the set $A$ and all the players in the set $B$ would be possible but the estimates would not be comparable between a player from $A$ and a player from $B$. The above suggests that we have to introduce some 'connections' between the sets $A$ and $B$ that would be informative about the outcomes between two players from these sets using either statistical or context-specific approaches to make the scores comparable. A few thoughts along those lines (one could use one or more of the following approaches): 

Now that I understand your question better, here is another attempt: Let $S_i$ be how strong item i is intrinsically. In a competition between items i and j the probability of i winning will depend on $S_i$ and $S_j$. For simplicity, let us assume that: $\theta_{ij} = S_i / (S_i + S_j)$ Use the likelihood ideas as I outlined earlier but now estimate $S_i$ instead of $\theta_{ij}$. Obviously, you will now need to include all trials in which i participated to estimate $S_i$ which I think takes care of the non-dependent nature of your dataset. You can of course take different functional forms that relate $\theta_{ij}$ to $S_i$ and $S_j$ (e.g., the logit). Does that make sense? 

I do not think the answer changes much from the basic situation. Consider a situation where $N$ takes two possible values: $N_1$ and $N_2$ with probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively. Then you want to maximize the following function: $f(.) = p E\Bigl(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N_1} u(a_i X_i )\Bigr) + (1-p) E\Bigl(\sum_{i=1}^{N_2} u(a_i X_i )\Bigr) $ Without loss of generality assume that $N_2$ > $N_1$. Then we can simplify the above and re-write as: $f(.) = E\Bigl(\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{N_1} u(a_i X_i )\Bigr) + (1-p) E\Bigl(\sum_{i=N_1 +1}^{N_2} u(a_i X_i )\Bigr) $ The maximum value of $f(.)$ can be computed by taking the maximum of the two terms independently as the set of 'parameters' ${a_i}$ are disjoint between the two terms. Thus, the maximum for the above case occurs at: $a_i= \frac{1}{N_1}$ for $i=1, 2, ...N_1$ and $a_i = \frac{1}{N_2-N_1}$ for $i=N_1 + 1, 2, ...N_2$ 

It sounds like you may want Exercise 9.7 in Hartshorne's "Residues and Duality". I paraphrase the statement: 

I don't know if this is exactly what you're looking for (and there's a good chance you already know what I'm going to write) but let me give it a try: The realization functor of cyclic sets (not spaces!) to $S^1$-spaces can be made part of a Quillen equivalence for two of the three commonly desired model structures on $S^1$-spaces: The model structure that gives you "Spaces over $BS^1$" is given in a 1985 paper of Dwyer-Hopkins-Kan, while a model structure that gives you the equivalences that you want (i.e., checked on fixed sets for finite subgroups) is given in a 1995 paper "Strong homotopy theory of cyclic sets" by Jan Spalinksi. (Irrelevant to your question, but along the same lines: A recent paper of Andrew Blumberg describes how one can throw in some extra--still combinatorial--data and obtain a combinatorial model of the third desirable model structure on $S^1$-spaces, namely where equivalences are those that induce equivalences on fixed sets for all closed subgroups.) Spalinksi's model structure depends on the following construction of $|X_{.}|^{C_n}$ (as a space-over-$BS^1$) in terms of the subdivision construction: The simplicial set $(sd_r X)_n = X_{r(n+1)-1}$ has an action of $C_r$--since $C_r$ is a subgroup of the copy of $C_{r(n+1)}$ acting on $X_{r(n+1)-1}$; taking fixed points (in sSet) and then realizing gives $|X_{.}|^{C_n}$. This suggests (though I haven't checked too carefully) that remembering each $X_n$ as a $C_{n+1}$-space (in the sense you suggest, with subgroups) is enough, as you expected. 

We can think of the splitting principle as a condition on a "cohomology theory" (of some sort) $E^*$, coming about when working with Chern classes for instance, and then ask: When does $E^*$ satisfy this condition? First, let's make the condition more precise and reformulate it: Condition 1: Given $X$ and a vector bundle $V$ on $X$, there exists $f: X' \to X$ such that $f^* V'$ has a filtration with subquotients line bundles, and $f^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(X')$ is injective. But there is a universal choice for $X'$, namely the flag variety of $V$: $p: Fl(V) \to X$. Any $f: X' \to X$ with $f^* V'$ filtered with line bundle subquotients will factor through $p$, and so we're really just asking if $p^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(Fl(V))$ is injective. Condition 1': For all $X$ and $V$, $p^*: E^*(X) \to E^*(Fl(V))$ is injective. At this point there are two ways this answer can go, depending on ones tastes: 

Now begins the speculative (and probably wrong) part of this answer: I have nothing too certain to say about writing this as a functor category, but it doesn't seem too unreasonable (to me, right now, at least) based on the above simplicial subdivision construction that we might be able to construct a reasonable candidate: some sort of mix of the cyclic category and the orbit categories for the cyclic groups. Purely combinatorially, this seems to get tricky. But, I think we can realize this geometrically: Let $(S^1)_r$ be the circle equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ action given by the rotation by $2\pi/r$. We could try to define $Hom'([m-1]_r, [m'-1]_{r'})$ along the lines of "(htpy classes of) degree $r'/r$, increasing $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant maps $S^1 \to S^1$ sending the $mr$-torsion points to the $m' r'$-torsion points". This should correspond to taking all the $r$-cyclic categories and sticking them together, and in particular is bigger than what we want. But, the $\mathbb{Z}$-action on the circles should induce one on the $Hom'$-sets and the composition should respect it. Taking the quotient, we seem to get something that looks like a reasonable candidate. For each fixed $r$, we should be getting a copy of the cyclic category. And, e.g. $Hom([m-1]_r, [mr-1]_1)$ should contain $Hom_{orbit}(Z/mr, Z/r)$. (Disclaimer: It's late and I haven't checked any of this too carefully!) 

Pillay and Scanlon gave an example showing Morley rank isn't definable in elementary extensions in: Compact complex manifolds with the DOP and other properties, J. Symbolic Logic, vol. 67 (2002), pp. 737–743. In a different direction Dale Radin showed the you do have definability of dimension in the standard model in: A definability result for compact complex spaces. J. Symbolic Logic vol. 69 (2004), pp. 241–254. 

Another way to do this is to use the Hensel-Rychlick version of Hensel's Lemma. This says that if you have $f\in {\mathbb Z}_p[X]$ and $a\in{\mathbb Z}_p$ such that $v(f(a))>2v(f^\prime(a))$, then $f$ has a zero in ${\mathbb Z}_p$. As in Jerome's answer we can find an integer $n$ such that $x=n+p^3\alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a unit. Let $f(X)=X^p-{x\over n}$. Then $v(f(1))=3$ while $v(f^\prime(1))=1$. Thus $x\over n$ has a $p$-th root. Indeed, the Hensel-Rychlick Lemma says you can find a zero $c$ with $v(c-a)\ge v(f(a))-v(f^\prime(a))$. 

I think the answer is no, but let me first give a precise version of the question (which I think Daniel's argument doesn't quite address). Fix some reasonable listing $P_0,P_1,\dots$ of recursively enumerable sets of polynomials. [See below for a ``reasonable" coding.] I claim that there is no algorithm to determine if $V(P_e)=\emptyset$. Let $K$ be the diagonal halting set. Namely, $K=$ {$e$: the $ e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $e$}. For each $e$ let $P_e=\{p_0,p_1,\dots\}$ be the recursively enumerable sequence of polynomials where $p_i=0$ if the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine has not halted by stage $i$ and $p_i=1$ if has. Then $V(P_e)=\emptyset \Leftrightarrow e\in K$. Since $K$ is undecidable there is no algorithm to decide if $V(P_e)$ is empty. One way to code sequences of polynomials would be to let $q_0,q_1,\dots$ list all polynomials, and let $P_e$ be {$q_i:$ the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input $i$}. To get to Ian's setting we could view $P_e$ as the sequence $p_0,p_1,\dots$ where $p_{(i,j)\}$ is 0 unless the $e^{\rm th}$ Turing machine halts on input i at stage $j$ in which case it is $q_i$ and $(i,j)$ is some computable pairing function. 

This was intended to be a comment to SJR's post, but was too long. Here is a proof that any formula that is preserved downwards in models of $T$ is equivalent in $T$ to a universal formula, from which we deduce that formulas preserved upwards are equivalent to existential formulas. Let $T$ be an $\cal L$-theory. Suppose $\phi(\bar v)$ is preserved downwards in models of $T$. Let $\Gamma(\bar v)=\{\psi(\bar v): \psi$ is universal and $T\models \phi(\bar v)\rightarrow \psi(\bar v)\}$. We claim that $T+\Gamma(\bar v)\models \psi(\bar v)$. If that happens then there are $\psi_1,\dots,\psi_n\in\Gamma(\bar v)$ such that $T\models \phi(\bar v)\leftrightarrow (\psi_1(\bar v)\land\dots\land\psi_n(\bar v)$. Suppose not. Then there is ${\cal M}\models T$ and $\bar a\in \cal M$ such that ${\cal M}\models \psi(\bar a)$ for $\psi\in\Gamma$ and ${\cal M}\models \neg\phi(\bar a)$. Let $T_1= T+ \phi(\bar a) + $ atomic diagram of $\cal M$. If $T_1$ is satisfiable there is ${\cal N}\models T$ with ${\cal M}\subset {\cal N}$ and ${\cal N}\models \phi(\bar a)$, contradicting the fact that $\phi$ is preserved downward. Thus $T_1$ must be unsatisfiable. Thus there is a quantifier free formula $\theta(\bar v,\bar w)$ and $\bar b\in \cal M$ such that $$T\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)\rightarrow \neg\phi(\bar a).$$ Since the parameters $\bar a$ and $\bar b$ don't occur in $T$, $$T\models \forall \bar v\ (\phi(\bar v)\rightarrow\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w))$$ But then $\forall \bar w\ \neg\theta(\bar v,\bar w)\in \Gamma$ contradicting the fact that ${\cal M}\models \theta(\bar a,\bar b)$.
