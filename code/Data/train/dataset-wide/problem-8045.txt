There are two statements about the grassmannian (of complex k-planes in n-space embedded via Plucker coordinates) that I have encountered in several places never accompanied with a proof or reference. 

One good way to understand Arrow's paradox (not sure if the 'everyday life' condition applies here!) is via homology. See for example Baryshnikov: Unifying Impossibility Theorems: A Topological Approach. Basically, voter's preferences, as well as the aggregate preference, are represented as points in a topological space. The choice rule is a map between these spaces. The conditions of Arrow's theorem force the induced map on homology to be that of a dictator. 

Here's what I know about this arrangement. Regarding the number of chambers in this arrangment, Zuev obtained the lower bound $2^{(1-o(1))n^2}$. The proof uses Zaslavsky's theorem and a difficult estimate due to Odlyzko. $URL$ describes an improvement to that lower bound (including references to Zuev's and Odlyzko's articles). $URL$ studies a closely related arrangement and gives a related (but weaker) lower bound using a very elegant method. It turns out the arrangment becomes much easier mod $2$ (even than one might expect). Whenever one has a central hyperplane arrangement one has a zonotope dual to it. Klivans and Reiner [ $URL$ ] fix $k$ and look at the zonotope (Minkowski sum of the line segments) generated by all 0/1-vectors of length $n$ with exactly $k$ ones. In particular they are interested in the zonotope considered as symmetric polynomial (the sum $\sum x^m$ over all lattice points $m$ in the zonotope). Thus the Minkowski sum of their zonotopes over $1\leq k \leq n$ is the zonotope dual to your arrangement. Degree sequences of hypergraphs correspond to integer points in this latter zonotope. Surprisingly the converse is false! This was showed by Liu [$URL$ ]. The vertices in the zonotope, and thus the regions in the arrangement, correspond almost to linear threshold hypergraphs (better known as linear threshold (Boolean) functions). A linear threshold hypergraph is determined by $n+1$ real potentially negative numbers $q,w_1,\dots,w_n$; any set $S\subseteq [n]$ with $\sum_{i\in S} x_i \leq q$ is declared an edge. "Almost" above means that the vertices in this zonotope correspond exactly to the linear threshold hypergraphs that can be given with $q = 0$. What if $q \neq 0$? Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ with $s$ simplices and degree sequence $v_1,\dots,v_n$, one can look at the values $s-2v_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$. If $\mathcal{H}$ happens to be down-closed, this is what game theorists call the Banzhaf value of the game represented by $\mathcal{H}$ and what computer scientists call the Boolean influence of the Boolean function represented by $\mathcal{H}$. Anyway it is more natural to look at the vector $(s,v_1,\dots,v_n)$ rather than just $(v_1,\dots,v_n)$. This corresponds to looking instead at the zonotope generated by $(1,0,0),(1,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,1,1)$ et.c. (all binary vectors of length $n$, prepended by $1$). The vertices (obviously more than when we didn't have the leading 1's in the generators) in this zonotope correspond exactly to linear threshold hypergraphs. Since each $v_i$ is an integer $0$ and $2^{n-1}$, and $s$ is between $2^n$ there are at most $2^{n + n(n-1)} = 2^{n^2}$ of them, giving an almost matching upper bound to the lower bound above. The latter zonotope is briefly mentioned in the end of the article $URL$ . I remember having seen a reference to a paper of Terao computing the characteristic polynomial of the arrangemnt for some small values, but cannot locate that reference right now. 

In the opposite direction, B. Hartley and M. Kuzucuoglu proved that in an infinite locally finite simple group the centralizer of every element is infinite. See Theorem A2 of the following paper: B. Hartley - M. Kuzucuoglu: “Centralizers of Elements in Locally Finite Simple Groups”, Proc. London Math. Soc. 62 (1991), 301-324. 

MacKay [On the structure of a special class of $p$-groups, Quart. J. Math. Oxford Ser (2) 38, 489-502] and, indipendently, Kiming [Structure and derived length of finite $p$-groups possessing an automorphism of $p$-power order having exactly $p$ fixed points, Math. Scand. 62, 153-172] showed that if a finite $p$-group $G$ admits an automorphism of order $p^n$ with exactly $p$ fixed points, then $G$ contains a subgroup $H$ of index bounded by a function of $p$ and $n$ which is nilpotent of class at most 2 (and $H$ is abelian if $p=2$). 

Let me just add some remarks. In general, if $L$ is a finite dimensional Lie algebra over an arbitrary field $F$ then a subalgebra $H$ of $L$ is called a Cartan subalgebra if $H$ is nilpotent and self-normalising in $L$. If $L$ is semisimple and $F$ has characteristic zero (as in the case asked by the OP) then the Cartan subalgebras of $L$ are precisely the maximal tori of $L$. (A torus of $L$ is an abelian subalgebra consisting of semisimple elements). Note that the existence of a Cartan subalgebra is always assured whenever the ground field has more than $\dim_F L$ elements. In particular, finite dimensional Lie algebras over infinite field always have Cartan subalgebras. Moreover, the Cartan subalgebras coincides with the minimal Engel subalgebras of $L$. (A subalgebra of $L$ is called an Engel subalgebra if it is the null Fitting component of $L$ with respect to $ad x$ for some $x\in L$.) See the paper R.E. Barnes: On Cartan Subalgebras of Lie Algebras, Math. Z. 101 (1967), 350-355. On the other hand, the existence of Cartan subalgebras of Lie algebras defined over small fields still remains an OPEN problem. It is also worth to mention that solvable Lie algebras always have Cartan subalgebras. Finally, if $L$ is a finite dimensional restricted Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $p>0$, then $H$ is a Cartan subalgebra of $L$ if and only if is the centralizer of a maximal torus of $L$. (Here a torus is an abelian subalgebra consisting of semisimple elements; an element $x$ of $L$ is semisimple it $x$ is in the restricted subalgebra generated by $x^{[p]}$). 

When I say "Markov chain" I think of a directed positively weighted (finite) graph, such that the sum of all edges going out of a vertex equals 1. Also I assume that it is aperiodic and irreducible. If the Markov chain happens to be equivalent to an "undirected Markov chain", i.e. for each directed arc (u,v) with weight w there is an arc (v,u) with same weight w, then it is easy to characterize the stationary distribution directly in terms of the graph; the stationary distribution at a vertex v is proportional to the out-degree (which in this case is half the total degree) of v. However I know of no such direct description of the stationary distribution in terms of the graph of a Markov chain that does not come from an undirected graph (except possibly for time-reversible chains, but this is a very special special case). My question is: are there any such descriptions? This is of course a bit vague(since the stationary distribution clearly depends only on the graph) but I hope it is not too vague. I would not expect an as easy description as in the undirected case (where it suffices to look in a neighbourhood of radius 1 to find the probability of any vertex), but it seems reasonable that there could be a description involving, say, all trees rooted at the vertex. This seems not to be treated in standard texts on Markov chains (correct me if wrong), where usually most effort is spent on proving existence, estimating speed of convergence, and the underlying graph is considered as 'auxilliary'. 

I'm looking for nice explanations of these two facts. EDIT: by the topology inherited from projective space I do not mean the Zariski topology, but the classical topology (given by balls in the Euclidean metric on the affine space from which we construct projective space, say). Since I have no intuition for the Zariski topology in this embedding, I'm not even sure I've got the statement correct: one place where it occurs is on page 147 in Fulton's Young tableaux book. EDIT 2: I have gotten it wrong; Fulton claims only that the Zariski closures of the open cells equal their classical closures. But he also calls it a general fact. I guess the proper version of my first question should be: why are the Zariski closures of the open schubert cells equal to their classical closures in the Pluecker embedding, and is there a general fact from which this follows? 

Only for information, I would like mentioning that a paper of C. Schneider and H. Usefi just on this topic recently appeared on arXiv: $URL$ 

I suggest to take a look at the first chapter of the book "Algebra. A graduate course" by M.I. Isaacs. 

It is also worth to recall that if $F$ is a field then a free algebra $F[X]$ has $F^\times$ as group of units for any set $X$... Anyway, there is an extensive literature devoted to study rings with a fixed group if units. A sample of this is the paper: I. Stewart: Finite rings with a specified group of units, Math. Z. 126 (1972), 51-58. 

Condition (i) can be removed, as already observed by Daniel. In positive characteristic you can find a counterexample in the book "J. Humphreys: Introduction to Lie algebras and representation theory" (Chapter 2, Section 4, page 20, Exercise 4), so condition (ii) cannot be relaxed. Finally, let $H={\mathbb F}x+{\mathbb F}y+{\mathbb F}z$ be the Heisenberg algebra with basis $x,y,z$, where $z$ is central in $H$ and $[x,y]=z$. Consider the ring of polynomials ${\mathbb F}[t]$ as a left $H$-module with $x$ acting as $d/dt$, $y$ acting by multiplication by $t$, and $z$ acting as the identity. Now consider the split extension $L=H\ltimes {\mathbb F}[t]$. Then $L$ is solvable of derived length 3, but the derived subalgebra $[L,L]={\mathbb F}z+{\mathbb F}[t]$ is not nilpotent. Thus condition (iii) cannot be removed. 

In analogy with the notion of normal closure in group theory, the smallest ideal of ${\mathfrak g}$ containing the subalgebra ${\mathfrak m}$ is indeed called the ideal closure of ${\mathfrak m}$ and denoted by ${\mathfrak m}^{\mathfrak g}$. This terminology is rather diffused in the literature: for instance, you can find it in many papers by Amayo, Stewart, Towers, etc. 

Dear Marco, it is well-known that if $F$ is a field of characteristic $p>0$ and $G$ is a group then the augmentation ideal of the group algebra $FG$ is nilpotent if and only if $G$ is a finite $p$-group (see the book "D. Passman: The algebraic structure of group rings", Lemma 1.6 of Chapter 3, page 70). In that case the Jacobson radical $J$ of $FG$ clearly coincides with the augmentation ideal which has codimension $1$ in $FG$, and you are done. You can also find the description of the Jacobson radical of the group algebra of a finite $p$-group over a field of characteristic $p>0$ in the book "R. Pierce: Associative algebras" (Corollary in Section 4.7).
