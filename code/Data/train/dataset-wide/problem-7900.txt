I find it helpful to first work through the definition of multiplication on $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}$ when $m = \infty$, in which case it reduces to the "classical" ring of differential operators in the sense of Grothendieck; read sections 16.7 and 16.8 of EGA 4, Quatri√®me partie. So let $A$ be a commutative base ring, let $S = Spec(A)$ and let $X = \mathbb{A}^1_S$ so that $B = A[t] = \Gamma(X, \mathcal{O})$. We want to work out $\mathcal{D}^{(\infty)}(X)$. Let $Y = X \times_S X$ and $m = \infty$. Let $n \geq 0$. First we have to work out the global sections of the sheaf $\mathcal{P}^n_{Xm}(Y)$, considered as a $B$-module. This will turn out to be dual (as a $B$-module) to the $B$-module of all Grothendieck differential operators of order at most $n$. Now $\mathcal{O}(Y) = B \otimes_A B$ is isomorphic as an $A$-algebra to the polynomial ring $A[t,t']$ where $t \mapsto t \otimes 1$ and $t' \mapsto 1 \otimes t$. The diagonal immersion $X \hookrightarrow Y$ corresponds to the algebra surjection $B \otimes_A B \to B$ which is just the multiplication map. So the ideal of the diagonal, namely the kernel of this map, is generated as an ideal by the element $$\tau := t \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes t.$$ Let's view $\mathcal{O}(Y)$ as a $B$-algebra via the map $b \mapsto b \otimes 1$; then $\mathcal{O}(Y) \cong B[\tau]$. By definition (EGA IV, 16.7.1.1), the global sections of $\mathcal{P}^n_{X\infty}(Y)$ are just $$P^n := \mathcal{O}(Y) / (\tau^{n+1})$$ --- this is the algebra of functions on the $n$-th infinitesimal neighbourhood of the diagonal $\tau = 0$ inside $\mathcal{O}(Y)$ (hence the $n+1$ in the exponent). So in particular it is a free $B$-module of rank $n+1$ with generators (the images of) $\tau^i$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$. By definition, $$\mathcal{D}^{(\infty)}_n (X) := Hom_B(P_n, B) =: D_n $$ which is again a free $B$-module of rank $n+1$; let $\{ \partial^{[i]}, i=0, \ldots, n\}$ be the dual basis for this module. Now the multiplication map $D_r \times D_s \to D_{r+s}$ is the $B$-module dual of a map $\delta : P^{r+s} \to P^r \otimes P^s$ which is constructed in EGA IV, Lemma 16.8.9.1. Morally $\delta$ sends $a \otimes b$ to $a \otimes 1 \otimes 1 \otimes b$, as Gros/Le Stum/Quirros mention. This turns out to be a $B$-algebra homomorphism, and tts key property is that $$\delta( \overline{\tau} ) = \overline{ \tau} \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes \overline{\tau}$$ (it is a "primitive element" in an appropriate bialgebra --- see EGA IV.4, 16.8.9.4). Let's now work out how to multiply $\partial^{[i]}$ by $\partial^{[j]}$ (drop the bars for clarity): $$(\partial^{[i]} \cdot \partial^{[j]})(\tau^k) = (\partial^{[i]} \otimes \partial^{[j]})(\tau \otimes 1 + 1 \otimes \tau)^k = \sum_{a + b = k} \binom{k}{a} \partial^{[i]}(\tau^a) \partial^{[j]}(\tau^b)$$ which is just $\binom{i+j}{i}\delta_{k,i+j}$. Since $\binom{i+j}{i} \partial^{[i+j]}$ has the same effect on each $\tau^k$, we deduce that $$ \partial^{[i]} \cdot \partial^{[j]} = \binom{i+j}{i} \partial^{[i+j]}$$ which is hopefully the familiar rule for multiplying divided powers (morally $\partial^{[i]} = \partial^i/i!$). The point of the Berthelot construction is that it is possible to vary the divided-power structure on the diagonal, and thereby control just how many divided powers one gets in $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}$. For example, if $m = 0$ then you instead allow all divided powers on the ideal of the diagonal (algebraically this means you consider the divided power algebra of the ideal $(\tau)$ in $B[\tau]$ to get $\oplus_{n=0}^\infty B \tau^{[n]}$), and when you take the $B$-dual, these divided powers in $\tau$ "remove" the divided powers in $\partial$ and you end up with $\mathcal{D}^{(0)}(X) = B[\partial]$, the ring of crystalline differential operators (no divided powers). Now to answer your question, let the level $m \geq 0$ be fixed. Then as Gros/Le Stum/Quirros explain just before Definition 2.5, $$\Gamma(Y, \mathcal{P}^n_{Xm}(Y)) = \oplus_{a=0}^n B \tau^{ \{ a \} } $$ where $\tau^{ \{ a \} }$ is a symbol that "behaves like $\tau^a / q_a!$" (where $q_a$ is the integer part of $a / p^m$: thus $a = q_a p^m + r_a$ say). To understand the multiplication of the dual vectors to these $\tau^{ \{ a \} }$, namely the $\partial^{ \langle a \rangle }$, we need to understand how to comultiply the $\tau^{ \{ a \} }$. So we compute (again dropping bars for convenience) $$ \delta( \tau^{ \{ a \} }) = \frac{1}{q_a!} \delta(\tau)^a = \sum_{i+j = a} \frac{1}{q_a!} \binom{i+j}{i} \tau^i \otimes \tau^j = \sum_{i+j = a} \frac{q_i! q_j!}{q_{i+j}!} \binom{i+j}{i} \tau^{ \{ i \} } \otimes \tau^{ \{ j \} }$$ and the same computation as above in the case $m=\infty$ shows that $$ \partial^{\langle i \rangle} \cdot \partial^{\langle j \rangle} = \frac{q_i! q_j!}{q_{i+j}!} \binom{i+j}{i} \partial^{\langle i + j \rangle}.$$ The interesting thing is that this structure constant $\frac{q_i! q_j!}{q_{i+j}!} \binom{i+j}{i}$ is always a $p$-integral rational number (see Lemma 1.1.3(i) in Berthelot's paper), so it makes sense whenever $A$ is an algebra over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$, say, and in particular if $A$ had characteristic $p$. Note that if $A$ was a $\mathbb{Q}$-algebra, then there would be a ring homomorphism from $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}$ to $A[t; \partial]$ which sends $$ \partial^{\langle i \rangle} \mapsto \frac{q_i!\partial^i}{i!} $$ since $$ \left(\frac{q_i! \partial^i}{i!}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{q_j! \partial^j}{j!}\right) = \frac{q_i! q_j!}{q_{i+j}!} \binom{i+j}{i} \left( \frac{q_{i+j}! \partial^{i+j}}{(i+j)!}\right).$$ Thus morally $\partial^{\langle i \rangle}$ should be thought of as "modified divided powers" $q_i! \partial^i / i!$. Finally, you don't need all of the $\partial^{\langle i \rangle}$ to generate $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}$. As is well-known, the full ring of Grothendieck differential operators in characteristic $p$ can be generated by the divided powers $\partial^{[p^a]}$ (for all $a \geq 0$). Since $q_i = 0$ for $i < p^m$ and $q_{p^m} = 1$, the modified divided powers $\partial^{\langle p^i \rangle}$ are equal to the "true" divided powers $\partial^{[p^i]}$ for $0 \leq i \leq m$. If $a > m$ then since $q_{p^a} = p^{a-m}$, $$\partial^{\langle p^a \rangle} = \frac{ p^{a-m}! }{ p^a! } \partial^{p^a} = \left(\frac{ p^{a-m}! (p^m!)^{p^{a-m}} }{p^a!} \right) (\partial^{\langle p^m \rangle})^{p^{a-m}}$$ shows that $\partial^{\langle p^a \rangle}$ is a $p$-adic unit times a power of $\partial^{\langle p^m \rangle}$ for $a \geq m$ since the $p$-adic valuation of that big fraction is $$\frac{p^{a-m}-1}{p-1} + p^{a-m} \frac{p^m-1}{p-1} - \frac{p^a-1}{p-1} = 0.$$ So we see that $\mathcal{D}^{(m)}(\mathbb{A}^1_S)$ in this case is the $A$-algebra generated by $t$ and the divided powers $\partial^{[p^0]}, \partial^{[p^1]}, \ldots, \partial^{[p^m]}$, subject to appropriate natural relations. Edit: To see what the map $X \to P_{Xm}(Y)$ looks like in the case $X = \mathbb{A}^1_S$, it is enough to describe the corresponding map $C := \mathcal{O}(P_{Xm}(Y)) \to B = \mathcal{O}(X)$ on functions, because everything in sight is affine. $C$ is a $B$-algebra, generated by symbols $\tau^{ \{a \} }$ for all $a \geq 1$ subject to the relations $$\tau^{ \{a \} } \cdot \tau^{ \{b \} } = \frac{q_{a+b}!}{q_a!q_b!} \tau^{ \{ a + b \} }$$ (note that the structure constant $\frac{q_{a+b}!}{q_a!q_b!}$ is actually an integer, this again follows from Lemma 1.1.3(i) in Berthelot's paper.) The map $C \to B$ sends all of the generators $\tau^{ \{a \} }$ to zero, and the map $C \to P^n$ which corresponds to the closed subscheme $P^n_{Xm}(Y)$ of $P_{Xm}(Y)$ sends all of the $\tau^{ \{ a \} }$ to zero for $a \geq n+1$. This description makes it easy to see that the algebra of functions $C$ on $P_{Xm}(Y)$ is isomorphic to the polynomial ring $B[\tau]$ when $m = \infty$ (since we can take $q_a$ to be always zero in this case), and to the "free" divided-power algebra $B[\tau^{[n]} : n\geq 1]$ that Gros/Le Stum/Quirros call $\Gamma_\bullet(B \tau)$ when $m = 0$. This is because $q_a = a$ in this case, so the defining relations between the $\tau^{ \{a \}}$ reduce to $$\tau^{ \{a \} } \cdot \tau^{ \{b \} } = \binom{a+b}{a} \tau^{ \{ a + b \} }.$$ 

Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a functor from the category of $k$-schemes to sets, uniformly corepresented by $M$. Suppose $U$ is an open subscheme of $M$. I could not find a good reference for uniformly corepresented. Is the fiber product $\mathcal{F} \times_{h_M} h_U$ corepresented by $U$? Any good reference on uniform corepresented functor will be most helpful. PS. Here $k$ is an algebraically closed field 

Let $f:X \to Y$ be a smooth morphism between projective varieties. Suppose $Y$ is a homogeneous space. Under what additional condition on $f$, can we conclude that every fibers of $f$ are isomorphic? 

Is there some standard technique or approach to determine when a (irreducible) subvariety of a rationally connected variety is again rationally connected? Any reference/text dealing with this kind of question will be most welcome. The example that I have in mind is the following: Let $P$ be the Hilbert polynomial of a complete intersection curve in $\mathbb{P}^3$ and $L$ an irreducible component of the corresponding Hilbert scheme parametrizing complete intersection curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$. Denote by $V \subset L$ the sublocus parametrizing curves which are not smooth. As far as I understand $L$ is rationally connected. Am I right? Then, I want to understand when is a connected component of $V$ again rationally connected. 

Let $X$ be a normal, projective variety and $U$ be the regular locus of $X$. Let $\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G}$ be reflexive sheaves on $X$ and $f:\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ be a morphism. Suppose that the restriction of $f$ to $U$ is surjective i.e., $f|_U:\mathcal{F}|_U \to \mathcal{G}|_U$ is surjective. Is it true that $f:\mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$ is surjective? The problem that I have is, $U$ need not be affine. The second question is: Is there any criterion when $U$ is going to be affine? More generally, does there exist an open subcheme $V$ contained in $U$ which is affine and satisfies $U\backslash V$ is of codimension at least $2$? 

It's true if $A$ is Noetherian. For any $A$-algebra $C$ and any ideal $J$ in $A$, note that $C/JC$ is isomorphic to the tensor product algebra $C \otimes_A A/J$. Now for any $n \geq 0$, $A/I^n$ is a module over $A^*$, and the multiplication map $A/I^n \otimes_A A^* \to A/I^n$ is an isomorphism, since $A$ is Noetherian --- see for example Proposition 10.13 of Atiyah and Macdonald's "Introduction to Commutative Algebra". Let $T = A^* \otimes_A B$. Then we get isomorphisms $T/I^n T \cong A/I^n \otimes_A (A^* \otimes_A B) \cong (A/I^n \otimes_A A^*) \otimes_A B \cong (A/I^n) \otimes_A B \cong B/I^nB$. Now pass to the inverse limit to obtain an isomorphism $T^* \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} B^*$. 

This is an algebraic elaboration on Emil's answer. Let $A = K \langle x_1,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ and let $\hat{A} = K \langle\langle x_1,\ldots, x_n \rangle \rangle$. Since $A$ is a subring of $\hat{A}$, a positive answer for $\hat{A}$ implies one for $A$. Now for each $d \in \mathbb{N}$, let $\hat{A}_{d}$ be the $K$-linear span of all products of the generators $x_1,\ldots, x_n$ of length exactly $d$. Then $\hat{A}_{d} \cdot \hat{A}_e = \hat{A}_{d+e}$ for all $d,e\in\mathbb{N}$, and there is a vector space isomorphism $$\prod_{d=0}^\infty \hat{A}_d \stackrel{\cong}{\longrightarrow} \hat{A}.$$ This just says that every non-commutative formal power series can be uniquely decomposed as an infinite (convergent in a natural topology on $\hat{A}$) sum of its homogeneous components. Now let $\hat{A}_{>m} := \prod_{d>m} \hat{A}_d$ for each $m \geq 0$. These are two-sided ideals of $\hat{A}$, and for each $m \geq 0$, $$V_m := \hat{A} / \hat{A}_{>m} \cong \prod_{d=0}^m \hat{A}_d$$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $K$, of dimension $N_m$, say. This gives us matrix representations $$\rho_m : \hat{A} \to End_K(V_m) \cong M_{N_m}(K).$$ Clearly $\hat{A}_{> m}$ is contained in $\ker \rho_m$, but in fact we have equality, because $\hat{A} / \hat{A}_{>m}$ (being an associative $K$-algebra in its own right) acts faithfully on itself by left multiplication. So if $P \in \hat{A}$ is zero on every set of $n$ matrices of size $N$ for all $N \geq 0$, then we see that in particular, $P \in \ker \rho_m$ for all $m \geq 0$. Hence $P \in \bigcap_{m \geq 0} \hat{A}_{>m}$, which implies that every homogeneous component of $P$ is zero. Hence $P$ is also zero. 

For $\kappa = \omega$ the above holds, it is a theorem due to M. Pouzet. The proof hinges on the following fact: 

They also show that $\mathrm{PFA} \rightarrow \mathrm{ISP}(\omega_2)$ (and $\mathrm{SP}(\omega_2)$), so one can read this as saying PFA implies $\omega_2$ is as "compact" as a supercompact, minus the inaccessibility. On the other hand, there are consequences of PFA (including the statement of PFA itself) which seem to say that $\omega_2$ is very much incompact. For instance, consider Rado's Conjecture (RC). RC is the statement: If $T$ is a tree such that every subtree of size $< \omega_2$ can be decomposed into countably many antichains, then so can $T$. It's not hard to see how RC is, in some sense, saying that $\omega_2$ is compact: If we replace $\omega_2$ with a compact cardinal $\kappa$ in the statement of RC, then the statement is true by the "compactness of the language $\mathcal{L}_{\kappa,\kappa}$" characterization of $\kappa$. But PFA contradicts RC. Nonetheless, both PFA and RC are usually obtained by proper forcings which collapse a supercompact to $\omega_2$. PFA itself seems to say $\omega_2$ is incompact: Let $\mathbb{P}$ be a proper forcing, and consider the language which has a constant symbol for every element of $\mathbb{P}$, a binary relation symbol (for the relation on $\mathbb{P}$), a unary predicate for each dense subset of $\mathbb{P}$, and a unary predicate which will stand for a generic filter. Consider the theory consisting of the positive diagram of $(\mathbb{P},\leq,p\ (p\in \mathbb{P}), D\ (D \subseteq \mathbb{P}\mbox{ dense}))$ together with formulas saying that $G$ is a filter and $G$ meets every $D$ (a new formula for each $D$). PFA says that any subtheory of size $< \omega_2$ has a model, but there's no filter meeting every dense set in the ground model, so loosely speaking, this theory doesn't have a model (although I suppose there could be a model which adds unnamed elements to each dense subset and has a generic meeting each dense subset at an unnamed condition). My question is: Is there some way to reconcile the fact that PFA seems to simultaneously say that $\omega_2$ has properties strongly indicative of some sort of compactness, and also has properties strongly indicative of some sort of incompactness? 

How about the Harish-Chandra isomorphism, which computes the centre of the universal enveloping algebra of $\mathfrak{g}$? 

Instead of updating my previous answer, I've decided to add a new answer in order to keep it short(ish). In the comments following his original question, TonyS added the extra assumption that $R$ is finitely generated over $A$. This is a strong condition, since it makes $R$ very close to being commutative. Moreover $R$ is known to be an integral domain, and a maximal order in its division ring of fractions $B$. Under these assumptions the $A$-torsion-free module $M$ is actually $R$-torsion-free. To see this, let $F$ be the field of fractions of $A$; then since $R$ is finitely generated over $A$, the central localisation $F \otimes_A R$ is an integral domain which is finite dimensional over the field $F$, and is therefore a division ring; thus $F \otimes_A R = B$. Now $F \otimes_A M = F \otimes_A (R \otimes_R M) = (F\otimes_A R) \otimes_R M = B \otimes_R M$ so the kernels of the localisation maps $M \to F \otimes_A M$ and $M \to B \otimes_R M$ coincide. Thus $M$ is $A$-torsion-free if and only if $M$ is $R$-torsion-free. Now let $N$ be a finitely generated $R$-bimodule which is torsion-free on both sides (for example $N$ could be $\omega_R$). Then $N \otimes_R M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module and therefore a finitely generated $A$-module. To study the torsion $T$ in this module, we study its support $Supp(T)$ in $Spec(A)$, or equivalently, the primes above the annihilator $Ann_A(M)$. Clearly $0$ is not in this support because $T$ is by definition a torsion $A$-module. I claim that there are no primes in $Supp(T)$ of height $1$. Suppose for a contradiction that $P \in Supp(T)$ has height $1$; then localising $A$ and $R$ at $P$ produces a new maximal order $R_P$ which is free and finitely generated as an $A_P$-module. But $A$ is a commutative regular local ring, hence a UFD by Auslander-Buchsbaum, so $A_P$ is a discrete valuation ring. Since $R_P$ is finitely generated over $A_P$, it must be semilocal; since $R_P$ is also a maximal order, under these conditions it is known that $R_P$ is actually a right and left principal ideal domain: see Proposition 2.9 and Theorem 2.8 of the book "Ordres Maximaux au Sens de K.Asano" by Guy Maury and Jacques Raynaud. Therefore the module $N_P$ is actually free over $R_P$ and hence $N_P\otimes_{R_P} M_P \cong M_P$ has no torsion. But this module is just $(N \otimes_R M)_P$ and by the exactness of localisation, $T_P$ is a torsion submodule of $(N \otimes_R M)_P$ and is therefore zero: thus $P \notin Supp(T)$, proving the claim. Now $A$ was assumed to be of dimension at most $2$, so we see that $Supp(T) \subseteq \{ \mathfrak{m} \}$ where $\mathfrak{m}$ is the maximal ideal of $A$. This is the best possible result, because $N \otimes_R M$ can easily have $\mathfrak{m}$-torsion, as the following (commutative!) example shows. Let $R = A$ and $N = M = \mathfrak{m}$. Pick a regular sequence $x,y$ in $\mathfrak{m}$, so that $0 \to A \stackrel{\alpha}{\to} A^2 \to \mathfrak{m} \to 0$ is a projective resolution of $\mathfrak{m}$, where $\alpha(a) = (ay, -ax)$. Then it's easy to see that $\mathfrak{m} \otimes_A \mathfrak{m} \cong \mathfrak{m}^2 / \alpha(\mathfrak{m})$. Now the image of the element $(y,-x) \in \mathfrak{m}^2$ in $\mathfrak{m}^2 / \alpha(\mathfrak{m})$ is non-zero and is killed by $\mathfrak{m}$, so the $\mathfrak{m}$-torsion submodule of $\mathfrak{m} \otimes_A \mathfrak{m}$ is non-zero. So to show that $\omega_R \otimes_R M$ has no torsion, one would have to show that $\omega_R$ doesn't "look like" $\mathfrak{m}$ (or perhaps a finite direct sum of copies of $\mathfrak{m}$) as an $A$-module. One way to ensure this is to perhaps try to show that $\omega_R$ is reflexive as an $R$-module, since this would help you to show that there are no essential extensions $E$ of $\omega_R$ such that $E/\omega_R$ is $\mathfrak{m}$-torsion. 

Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$ satisfying $H^1(\mathcal{O}_X)=0$. Fix $i:X \to \mathbb{P}^n$ a closed immersion and let $\mathcal{O}_X(1)$ be the corresponding very ample line bundle. This means that the Picard group is isomorphic to the Neron-severi group of $X$. By Severi's theorem of base, we know that the rank of the Neron-Severi group is finite. Does this mean that for a fixed Hilbert polynomial $P$, there are only finitely many invertible sheaves (upto isomorphism) on $X$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$ i.e., is $$\#\{\mathcal{L} \in \mbox{Pic}(X)|\chi(\mathcal{L}(m))=P(m) \mbox{ for } m \gg 0\}< \infty?$$ 

Fix an integer $N$, $X$ a (smooth) complete intersection subvariety in $\mathbb{P}^N$. Denote by $P$ the Hilbert polynomial of $X$ (as a subvariety in $\mathbb{P}^N$). Consider the Hilbert scheme $\mbox{Hilb}_P$, parametrizing all subscheme in $\mathbb{P}^N$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$. Let $H$ be an irreducible component of $\mbox{Hilb}_P$ containing the point corresponding to $X$. Then, 1) Do all closed points in $H$ correspond to complete intersection subschemes in $\mathbb{P}^N$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$? 2) If a general element of $H$ correspond to a complete intersection subscheme in $\mathbb{P}^N$ with Hilbert polynomial $P$, then is there a positive answer to question $1$? 

Let $X$ be a smooth, quasi-projective variety, $G$ be a finite group which acts freely and properly on $X$. Denote by $\alpha:X \to X/G$ the quotient. Is $\alpha$ generically etale? Also, as I am new to this topic (of group action on varieties) can someone suggest a good reference for the topic? I am mainly interested in finite group actions. 

Then, since $D$ is a directed subset of $j^{\ast}(C)$, elementarity will give us that $j''\lambda \in j^{\ast}(C)$, as desired. Since $M^{\lambda} \subset M$, we know that $g := j\upharpoonright \lambda \in M$. So for $x \in X$ (and in particular for $x \in C$), $j^{\ast}(x) = j''x = g''x$. Using this it's not hard to see that $\bigcup D = j''\lambda$. It also implies that $j^{\ast}$ $''X$ $= \{j^{\ast}(x)\ |\ x \in X\}$ $= \{j''x\ |\ x \in X\} = \{g''x\ |\ x \in X\}$ belongs to $M$. Now if $h : X \to C$ is a surjection in $V[G]$, then $j^{\ast}(h)\upharpoonright j^{\ast}$ $''X$ is belongs to $M[G\times H]$ and its range is $D$, so $D \in M[G\times H]$. It remains to show $M[G\times H] \vDash |D| < j(\kappa)$. Since $j(\kappa)$ is inaccessible in $M$, there's some bijection $i: \alpha \to Y$ in $M$ for some $\alpha < j(\kappa)$. This gives a surjection $k : \alpha \to X$ in $M[G\times H]$. We can obtain a bijection $l : X \to j^{\ast}$ $''X$ via $l(x) = g''x$. And $j^{\ast}(h)\upharpoonright j^{\ast}$ $''X$ is a surjection onto $D$. So: $M[G\times H] \vDash |D| \leq |j^{\ast}$ $''X| = |X| \leq \alpha < j(\kappa)$. 

There are many consequences of the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA) which essentially say that $\omega_2$ has a lot of compactness. For instance, Matteo Viale and Christoph Weiss have a few papers in which the combinatorial properties $\mathrm{SP}(\kappa)$ and $\mathrm{ISP}(\kappa)$ (which can be seen as generalizations of the tree property) are isolated, and the following theorems (which are modification of older results of Jech and Magidor, respectively) are stated:
