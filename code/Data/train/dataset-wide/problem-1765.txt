As Walter says, most of them use Newtonian gravity on a expanding background. Not necessarily directly computer particle-particle Newtonian force, but perhaps modeling Poisson's equation through mesh methods, or perhaps some combination thereof (e.g., direct force calculations for close particles, mesh methods for larger scales). 

Yes. If we wish, we can think of the redshift due to a particle (e.g., galaxy) at some radial coordinate as a combination of two things: the special-relativistic time dilation of a galaxy with respect to a local static observer and the gravitational time dilation between static observers given above. In fact, the $\epsilon$ parameter above is exactly the (per-mass) energy of the particle as measured by a local static observer, i.e., the relative Lorentz gamma. 

Quite the opposite; black hole are the most entropic objects for their size. In the early 1970s, physicists have noticed an interesting analogies between how black holes behave and the laws of thermodynamics. Most relevantly here, the surface gravity $\kappa$ of a black hole is constant (paralleling zeroth law of thermodynamics) and the area $A$ of a black hole is classically nondecreasing (paralleling second law). This is extended further with analogies of the first and third laws of thermodynamics with $\kappa$ acting like temperature and $A$ as the entropy. The problem is that for this to be more than an analogy, black holes should radiate with temperature that's (some multiple of) their surface gravity. But they do; this is called Hawking radiation. So the area can shrink as long as there is a compensating entropy emitted to the outside: $$\delta\left(S_\text{outside} + A\frac{k_\text{B}c^3}{4\hbar G}\right)\geq 0\text{.}$$ Thus, semi-classically, the entropy of a black hole is proportional to its surface area. In natural units, it is simply $S_\text{BH} = A/4$, which is huge because Planck areas are very small. Thus, we know that in a semi-classical approximation, a black hole must radiate with temperature proportional to its surface gravity and entropy proportional to its area. It's natural to wonder the next step: if a black hole has all this entropy, where is the structure? How can it have so many possible microstates if it's classically just a vacuum? But going there takes us to the land of quantum gravity, which is not yet firmly established, and is outside the scope for astronomy. 

This is true, but some simulations use relativistic corrections. The post-Newtonian expansion works in order $\epsilon\sim v^2\sim U$, where $U$ is (the negative of) Newtonian potential, and including the first-order post-Newtonian correction to the N-body equations of motion forms the Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations. Because they contain $3$-body terms, the simulation would now be $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ instead of the Newtonian simulation $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$. The post-Newtonian three-body equations are known to 2PN, while the two-body problem to 3.5PN. Effects beyond the first order can be important in e.g. binary simulations because gravitational radiation losses are seen at 2.5PN order. However, they are not translatable to an N-body problem. A technique of making the EIH equations more tractable by making a second expansion that depends on the problem at hand can be found in Will (2014), which is applicable when most the relativistic dynamics are dominated by a few contribution (e.g., a supermassive central black hole in galaxy simulations). 

There are many studies and simulations that consider dark matter with a nonzero pressure component, sometimes even anisotropic pressure components. For example, "hot" dark matter would have $p\sim\rho/3$, while "cold" dark matter would have $p\sim 0$, "warm" dark matter somewhere inbetween. The CDM in the ΛCDM model stands for "cold dark matter", naturally. There are more exotic possibilities with anisotropic pressure components, etc. But I don't know of any paper that looked specifically for $\rho<0$ dark matter, and for the above reasons I'd be surprised if one existed. 

Cosmological evolution is described by the Friedmann equations, which has the principal contribution of radiation, matter, and dark energy, in addition to spatial curvature of the universe. As the universe expands, both radiation and matter get diluted, but dark energy does not. Therefore, if the universe keeps expanding, the proportion of dark energy becomes dominant over both radiation and matter. Most likely, the article is simply an exaggerated reference to the transition between the matter-dominated era and the dark-energy-dominated era. The particular number $6,771,500,000$ years seems comically precise for much of anything in cosmology, but since the nine-year best-fit WMAP+eCMB+BAO+H₀ (see above WMAP link) for the age of the universe is $13.772\pm0.059\,\mathrm{Ga}$, I propose the following explanation: 

For an isolated black hole in a particular frame field, this is a valid picture. For example, the Schwarzschild spacetime in Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates can be interpreted as Euclidean space falling into the black hole. However, the spacetime is itself is stationary (even static) in the geometrical sense—there is a timelike field representing a direction in which spacetime geometry is left unchanged (this corresponds to Schwarzschild time, in fact). Similarly, rotating black hole spacetimes are stationary. But generally speaking, you really can't think of black holes as some sort of suck-holes for space. It's just an analogy that applies to simple situations (isolated black holes, with nothing else in spacetime) and then only in a particular frame or coordinates. That's not to say it's useless--e.g., acoustic horizons in fluids are interesting analogies to event horizon--but don't take it too literally. See also this question. 

The Sun has $GM = 1.3271244\times 10^{20}\,\mathrm{m}^3/\mathrm{s}^2$, so at about $r \approx 1\,\mathrm{AU}$, the Earth holding still would give about $GM/r^2 = 5.9\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{s}^2$, which is about $0.06\%$ of Earth's gravity. So they weigh more by about that proportion if on the far side from the Sun, and less if on the near side. This works out to be about $1.4\,\mathrm{oz}$. The centrifugal force provided by the Earth's rotation is a few times more significant, up to about $34\,\mathrm{mm}/\mathrm{s}^2$, depending on the location on the Earth. 

Weighlessness is a property of gravitational freefall. When you're standing on the surface of the Earth, the weight you feel is the reaction force of the Earth's surface stopping you from falling, i.e., weight is caused by the failure of gravitational freefall. There is no relevant difference between a round orbit and a radial plunge orbit. They're both completely valid orbits as far as the laws of physics are concerned, and the fact that one will eventually smack you into the Earth does not matter until it actually happens. 

You can always formally define a time $t'$ such that the big bang occurs at $t'\to-\infty$, or some such thing, e.g., by $t' = t_0\log(t/t_0)$, where $t$ is the usual cosmological time and $t_0$ is some arbitrary time scale. But doing this is merely a relabeling of coordinates, and has no physical significance. In particular, it doesn't change the length of the worldline of any observer, which is the duration measured by a clock along that worldline, aka proper time. And in the usual Big Bang cosmology (though not all FLRW solutions), the proper time of any observer, however idealized, is finite in the past. Relabeling to infinite time is no different then taking the usual Euclidean space in Cartesian coordinates, $(x,y,z)$, defining a new coordinate $\xi = \log x$, and then saying that the origin is now infinitely far away, being at $\xi\to-\infty$. You can define the coordinate, but it doesn't change actual distances. 

Light itself experiences only trivial time dilation in the sense that the proper time along any lightlike trajectory is exactly $0$. Above, we were talking about stationary observers, and light is not stationary. Rather, $\mathrm{d}\tau = 0$ for light beams, always. So strictly speaking, light doesn't experience anything at all. However, if you mean what the stationary observers would get when measuring light bent around the black hole, then it is blueshifted when coming closer to the black hole and redshifted when moving away--in the sense that this would be what stationary observers closer or farther away would measure. The details of the path it took between the observers do not matter; the ratio of measured frequencies will just be the inverse of the time dilation factor between the observers. 

I have no idea what Plamondon's model is, but I would be rather suspicious of any model that gives "exactly" $43.13$ when that's just the middle of an interval of statistical uncertainty according to one of the many prior analyses of Mercury's orbit. 

Yes. If the first stationary observer is shifted closer to the horizon ($r_1\to R$), then $(1-R/r_1)\to 0$, so the above time dilation goes to $0$ as well. So, for example, if that observer shines a laser beam toward the other, it will be redshifted when it arrives to the other. This is really the same thing as time dilation. The laser beam has a certain frequency, so it takes a certain amount of time for one oscillation. Thus a frequency shift is just another way of talking about time dilation, except that time dilation means that this happens to every process, not just light: e.g, if the first observer taps his foot at a certain frequency (say, a tap per second), the second observer will see him tapping at a lower frequency (say, a tap per two seconds). Slowed. We can can still call this "redshift" in the sense that the frequency was shifted in the same way, although the term is usually used specifically for electromagnetic radiation. 

Since etymologically sidereal references the stars (Latin sidus), one might expect a sidereal day to correspond to the rotation of the Earth with respect to distant "fixed" stars. But this does not seem to be the case, and because the the difference is not significant, the two definitions are sometimes used interchangeably. I don't know of an explicit IAU definition of sidereal day. However, since sidereal time is defined as the hour angle vernal equinox (which is a local definition, although Greenwich is conventional), defining the (mean) sidereal day in terms in reference to the equinox is practically the only sensible choice. Effective 1985, UT1 is now computed using very long baseline interferometry of distant quasars, and so can be taken to be authoritative regarding the "fixed stars". The coordinated universal time (UTC) time approximates UT1 with atomic clocks. Anyway, UT1 derived the rotational period of the Earth as $p = 86164.09890369732\,\mathrm{s}$ of UT1 time and the mean sidereal day (in 2000) would be $86164.090530833\,\mathrm{s}$ of UT1 time, following the explanation: 

In the standard ΛCDM cosmology, the expansion of the universe is modelled by a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, usually interpreted as a constant density of dark energy. A nonzero cosmological constant somewhat modifies the usual black hole geometries. For example, the simplest Schwarzschild black hole (isolated, uncharged, nonrotating) is described by $$\mathrm{d}s^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)\mathrm{d}t^2 + \left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)^{-1}\mathrm{d}r^2 + r^2\mathrm{d}\Omega^2\text{,}$$ which with a nonzero $\Lambda$ would be the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime described by the replacement $$\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}\right)\mapsto\left(1-\frac{2GM}{r}-\frac{\Lambda r^2}{3}\right)\text{.}$$ Therefore, a cosmological constant would not cause a black hole to expand or contract. Rather, its size (i.e. of the horizon) is slightly modified by the cosmological constant. The same kind of thing happens to other bound systems, such as star systems and galaxies: in principle the expansion of the universe modifies their size by a slight amount, but the forces that bind them simply find an equilibrium against cosmic expansion. It would take some extended model of dark energy, in which it is not a constant, to expand of shrink black holes. But there is currently no evidence of such a thing. Side note: since the Hawking temperature of any astrophysical black hole would be much lower than the surrounding space (e.g., cosmic microwave background), we can expect black holes to slightly expand due to absorbing more energy from their environment than their lose by Hawking radiation. But this effect is both tiny and has a completely different mechanism than the expansion of the universe.
