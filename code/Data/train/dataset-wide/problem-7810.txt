The intuition I have is that relations definable by polynomials is complicated enough that projections can give rise to very complicated sets. The essential point here is not exponential growth, that comes from the unboundedness of the quantifiers, the essential point is that the graph of a very fast growing function can be represented by a polynomial. On the other hand, if the question is about how polynomial equations can represent graphs of complicated function, then I guess the best explanation is by the people who came up with the idea of how to use these equations to represent the graph of a fast growing function, which can find in My Collaboration with JULIA ROBINSON by Yuri MATIYASEVICH (skip to the line numbered (6) in the text) or in his book. 

In general you can pick any set of properties regarding the model theory of logics you are interested in and create an abstract theory about them. Most of these will not be interesting for various reasons but some will be. An example of nice class of model theoretic properties is those chosen for Abstract Elementary Classes. You may want to check John Baldwin's slides to get a feeling of the model theory that can be derived using such simple model theoretic axioms. 

There isn't one correct definition of a relativization of a complexity class. Depending on the circumstances there are different definitions which are useful. So we don't have a single way of defining the relativization even for a fixed complexity class. As an example, consider the complexity class $\mathsf{L}$. Using one definition we can show that there is an oracle $A$ s.t. $\mathsf{L}^A=\mathsf{PSpace}^A$. On the other hand, hierarchy theorem relativizes, so $\mathsf{L}^A \neq \mathsf{PSpace}^A$ for all $A$. These results look contradictory at the first sight but they are not. The key point is that they are using different definitions. Both definitions are used in the literature. Depending on what we want to achieve we have different suitable relativizations. This is similar (though more subtle) to reductions, there are several of them, some results hold w.r.t. one kind of reductions and fail w.r.t. another one. 

I now believe that the statement in question (from the paper), "... the Riemannian connection $\bar\nabla$ of $M$... is compatible with $<\,,\,>$ but not with $(\,,\,)$" is false. It seems that both products are compatible with the connection $\bar\nabla$. As far as I can tell, the argument about parallel transport that I outlined above is correct, and the source of my confusion was a relatively trivial one with the spinorial Gauss equation. I'd like to outline how the spinorial Gauss equation is consistent with the parallel transport picture. I'll reference the arxiv document, page 7, that was linked at the end of the original post. The spinorial Gauss equation as stated in this link (and using the notation from the Parker/Taubes paper; sorry for the possible annoyance) is $$\nabla_X\phi=\bar\nabla_X\phi-\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\phi$$ Here $h$ is the second fundamental form, thought of as an endomorphism of the tangent bundle, i.e. the shape operator. The minus sign (as opposed to the $+$ in the link; hope I have this right, though it shouldn't affect the remainder of the argument) is due to the fact that $e_0$ is lightlike, which doesn't factor in to the Riemannian situation. Now, we want to see if $\bar\nabla$ is compatible with $(\,,\,)$. First note that $\nabla$ is compatible with $(\,,\,)$, so $$X(\phi,\psi)=(\nabla_X\phi,\psi)+(\phi,\nabla_X\psi)=(\bar\nabla_X\phi,\psi)+(\phi,\bar\nabla_X\psi)-\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}[(h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\phi,\psi)+(\phi,h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\psi)]$$ which shows compatibility if $(h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\phi,\psi)+(\phi,h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\psi)=0$. To this end, we recall (see the Parker/Taubes paper) that Clifford multiplication is Hermitian with respect to $(\,,\,)$. Thus $$(h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\phi,\psi)=(e_0\cdot\phi,h(X)\cdot\psi)=(\phi,e_0\cdot h(X)\cdot\psi)=-(\phi,h(X)\cdot e_0\cdot\psi)$$ which cancels out the other term. This establishes that $\bar\nabla$ on $M$ is compatible with $(\,,\,)$. 

The other version of the axiom: $$\forall x\in X \ \exists y \ \varphi(x,y) \to \ \exists Y \ \forall x\in X \ \exists y\in Y \ \varphi(x,y)$$ 

EDIT: I am mostly interested in the case that the paper is in your area and is not written by a crank but by a mathematician with previous publications in reputable journals (although not necessary in the same area or a related one). 

Remember that this is finite model theory and it is quite different from logic on infinite structures, e.g. satisfiability of first-order formulas on finite structures is $\Sigma_1$, whereas the same question is $\Pi_1$ for general structures (where the formula is satisfiable iff it does not lead to (i.e. prove) contradiction). It is not known yet if the properties of the finite structures expressible in SO are different from those expressible in $FO(LFP)$. 

This is studied in bounded reverse math by people like Fernando Ferreira and colleagues. The base theory BTFA [Fer'94] is a two sorted theory version of Sam Buss's bounded arithmetic theory $S^1_2(\alpha)$ [Bus85, ch. 9] plus bounded collection/replacement for $\Sigma^b_\infty $ formulas ($B\Sigma^b_\infty$) plus a form of comprehension axiom for $\Delta_1$ sets ($\nabla^b_1CA$): $$\forall x (\forall z \ \varphi(x,z) \leftrightarrow \exists y \ \psi(x,y)) \Rightarrow \exists Z \ \forall x \ (x \in Z \leftrightarrow \exists y \ \psi(x,y))$$ where $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are respectively $\Pi^b_1$ and $\Sigma^b_1$ formulas. This is a modification of Simpson's axiom in his book [Sim'09]. Because of its special form the first order part is conservative over $S^1_2$ and is incapable of using the full power of comprehension for $\Delta_1$ sets. On the other hand, the second order part of the smallest model of the theory is $\Delta_1$ sets. In [FF'02, thm. 4], a version of the Intermediate Value Theorem is proven in BTFA. Some caution is needed here in formalizing the IVT. Also the proof is not constructive (either there is a rational number which is the root of the function or we can continue a process getting arbitrary close to a root. Deciding that a given rational number is not a root of the function is not decidable and this is required since we need to stop the process of dividing the current interval into two halves if we reach a root, i.e. we need this assumption so we have $f(m)<0 \ \lor \ f(m)>0$ where $m$ is the rational mid-point of the current interval). As far as I remember WKL is not provable in BTFA. See also [FF'05] and [FF'08]. 

Let's say we have an oriented compact 4-d Riemannian spin manifold $(M,g)$. Everybody who's anybody has heard about the index of the Dirac operator $D: S^+\rightarrow S-$; it's the $\hat{A}$-genus, which is $\displaystyle\frac{-1}{8}\tau(M)$ ($\tau$ is the signature). I don't know too much about the index theorem and it's inner workings, but I'm wondering what happens if you perturb the Dirac operator and consider $$D_{f,s}=D+s\textrm{grad}(f)\cdot$$ where s is a (let's say small) real parameter and $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$; "$\cdot$" indicates Clifford multiplication, and maps $S^+\rightarrow S^-$ since elements of $TM$ anticommute with the volume element in dimension 4. Does the index stay the same? Change in a predictable way related to $f$? What if $f$ is special somehow? What about in the special case where $\tau=0$? Or the even-more-special case where $\tau=0$ because the dimension of the harmonic spinors is $0$, e.g. when $R>0$? How does the dimension of the kernel jump as $s$ changes? Sorry for the avalanche of questions. I'm interested in any information people have about any subset of them. 

Some context: In the theory of compact, oriented Riemannian Einstein 4-manifolds, there is a a fundamental topological constraint that is implied by the Einstein equations. To wit, if $\chi$ and $\tau$ denote the Euler characteristic and signature of a fixed 4-manifold $M$, then $$2\chi\pm3\tau=\textstyle\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\displaystyle\int_M\,\big(\displaystyle\frac{R^2}{12}-\mathring{|Rc|}^2+|W^{\pm}|^2 \big)\,dV$$ for $any$ Riemannian metric on $M$. As the traceless Ricci tensor $\mathring{Rc}$ vanishes identically for an Einstein metric, these 2 (well, 1 if $\tau=0$) topological invariants are non-negative if an Einstein metric exists on $M$. This is known as the Hitchin-Thorpe inequality. One can calculate that in fact $2\chi \pm 3\tau=p_1(\Lambda^2_{\pm})$ by using the connection which is induced on $\Lambda^2_{\pm}$ by the Levi-Civita connection, so the presence of an Einstein metric on $M$ means that the first Pontryagin number of the bundles $\Lambda^2_{\pm}$ is non-negative. My question is plainly this: Sticking with a 4-manifold $M$, what does it mean in a tangible, geometric sense, to say that a vector bundle over $M$ has non-negative/positive first Pontryagin number? Or perhaps more generally, what does the quantity $p_1$ in fact quantify? Does it say something about generic sections of the bundle (I vaguely recall that the Steifel-Whitney classes quantify something like this), or something else palpable? I'd be perfectly happy if one were to restrict discussion to the bundles $\Lambda^2_{\pm}$ above or maybe general rank-3 bundles if either simplifies the discussion. 

The reflection is similar to the property above with truth replaced with provability: let $\square$ denote the provability in theory $T'$. Then reflection property is: 

E.g. we have: $\mathbb{N} \vDash Tr(\ulcorner \top \urcorner)$, $\mathbb{N} \nvDash Tr(\ulcorner \bot \urcorner)$, $\mathbb{N} \nvDash Tr(\ulcorner \exists x \ (x + 1 = 0)\urcorner)$, etc. Consider the following property: 

Note that there are different ways of thinking about set theory and more generally about Logic. They can be thought as a foundation for mathematics or they can be thought as a part of mathematics. If you are thinking of them as a foundation, at the end you have to accept some intuitive concepts, the point of foundation is not that it does not assume anything and builds on nothing, the point is that it is based on accepted theories. Almost all of mathematicians accept the very weak theories about natural numbers and they are sufficient for building the needed metamathematics for set theory. (Primitive Recursive Arithmetic would suffice but even weaker theories are sufficient). I would suggest the introduction of K. Kunen's "Set Theory" book (the part he discusses the formalist viewpoint) and S.C. Kleene's "Metamathematics". 

I have been trying to understand what is exactly a sieve and why sieves are useful. I have read Wikipedia articles about sieve theory but they don't provide a definition of what is a sieve or why they are useful. Can someone explain what is a sieve in general terms and what properties of sieves make them so useful in attacking number theoretic problems? Are there general principles that one can use as a guideline to see if sieves are likely to be useful in attacking a problem? I know this question might be a bit elementary for number theorists, but I wasn't able to find good and concise information at the level of a general mathematician. (The Wikipedia article links to Ben Green's notes about sieve theory but the link is not working anymore. I Googled a bit however I couldn't find a concise high-level but rigorous exposition, notes like this and this dive quickly into examples and applications without giving any general definition and discussion of sieves.) 

The Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem says that if on a compact 4-dimensional spin manifold there exists a metric whose scalar curvature $R>0$, then there are no harmonic spinors; $$D\psi=0 \implies \psi=0$$ This follows from the Bochner-type formula $$D^2=\nabla^*\nabla + \displaystyle\frac{R}{4}$$ by applying it to a spinor field $\psi$ and pairing with $\psi$ to obtain $$\int \, \rvert D\psi\rvert^2 \,dV = \int \, \vert \nabla\psi \rvert^2 \, dV + \displaystyle\frac{R}{4}\int \, \rvert \psi \rvert^2 \, dV$$ from which the statement follows directly. My question is about whether there's a sort of converse to this reasoning. That is, suppose we have a compact Riemannian spin manifold and we know that there are no solutions to $D\psi = 0$ except the trivial one $\psi=0$. Does it follow that $R\ge 0$ (hopefully with $R>0$ at some point)? My vague intuition for the plausibility of this is the following: Staying away from the zero section, we know that as you range over all spinor fields, the LHS of the integral formula above is strictly positive. Suppose $R<0$ at some point. Is there enough "flexibility" in our choice of spinor field to localize near this negative value and make the RHS negative (by making the second term dominate the first in absolute value) so as to generate a contradiction? 

The other day I happened to be browsing this page on wikipedia: $URL$ In the middle of the page is the equation $$\square\phi+\lambda\phi^3=0$$ where $\square$ is the spacetime Laplacian. This is the Euler-Lagrange equation for a scalar field theory with a quartic potential. By coincidence, I also happened to be thinking about the Yamabe problem in dimension 4, and was browsing Parker and Lee's article on the subject $URL$ If you plug n=4 into equation (1.2) on page 2 of that article, you get $$(6\Delta+R)\phi=\lambda\phi^3$$ where $\Delta$ is the Laplacian with positive spectrum. This is the equation that must be satisfied by a conformal change to a metric with constant scalar curvature. At a glance it is clear that these equations are basically the same. I tried Googling to see if there was any literature on this similarity. I assume someone else must have noticed this before, but couldn't find anything. I know that the Yamabe problem is a fundamental classical problem in Riemannian geometry, and that $\phi^4$ field theory is fundamental to physics (Witten, writing for mathematicians, discusses it a bit on page 382 here $URL$ so it doesn't necessarily strike me as idle to wonder about a connection. Is anyone aware of whether there is anything to this observation? Is it just a coincidence? Or does it suggest some physical model associated with the Yamabe problem? (Hopefully you agree that the connection is suggestive enough to overlook how ill-drawn my questions are.) 

This is not an answer to the question intended by OP, but rather a philosophical meta-answer and might be interesting to some readers. The use of sign $\vdash$ is completely different from $\rightarrow$. You can not prove "$\varphi \vdash \psi$", since it is not a proposition. It is a speech-act, it is invented by Frege and has been discussed extensively in philosophy of mathematics and philosophy of language. This speech-act is called assertion and is composed of two separate parts "|" and "-". It is an act of judgment. For more details see this SEP article. This distinction between a proposition and a judgment is very important and essential for Martin-Lof's type theory and philosophy. In fact, from this viewpoint, $\varphi \vdash \psi$ is a common formal misuse because the assumptions cannot be before the speech-act. For this reason Martin-Lof prefers to write the assumptions of the assertion after the proposition in his type theories. For difference between $\vdash$ and $\rightarrow$ see this article. 

It is an open problem if there is an optimal propositional proof system. Therefore we don't know if ZFC as a propositional proof system is optimal either. ZFC as propositional proof system can p-simulate any propositional proof system whose soundness (if there is proof for a formula then the formula is true) as a propositional proof system is provable in ZFC. The trick (which I think is due to Steve Cook) is based on the fact that proofs are concrete finite objects, if there is a proof for a formula in a proof system, then ZFC can prove its existence (i.e. ZFC is $\Sigma_1$-complete), combining this with the provability of the soundness we derive the truth of the encoded formula in ZFC. The rest of the argument is translating this first order proof in ZFC to a propositional proof in ZFC as propositional proof system and proving the equivalence of a propositional formula with the formula itself in the proof system. This can be done in $\mathsf{TC^0}$-Frege and any system that contains it. See Logical Foundations of Proof Complexity, 2010 by Cook and Nguyen for the details.
