Suppose given a $1$-separated net $\Gamma\subset\mathbb R^2$. Is it true or false that there exists $\delta>0$ and a $\delta$-isoradial graph containing $\Gamma$ as a subset of its vertices? (I am also interested in partial results in this direction.) edit: a $\delta$-isoradial graph in $\mathbb R^2$ is a graph each of whose faces is a finite polygon inscribed in some circle of radius $\delta$. edit2: A case where the answer is "yes": if we have a graph whose faces are $\delta$-rhombi then by considering only odd vertices gives us an isoradial graph. It will help to consider such graphs instead of $\delta$-isoradial ones. If $\Gamma$ is included in the graph of a continuous function $G_f:=\{(x,f(x)):x\in\mathbb R\}$ then we may approximate $G_f$ by a polygonal $\delta$-path $P$ which comes from a graph of a function $\tilde f$ and contains $\Gamma$ as a subset of its odd vertices. Now extend $P$ to a path of $\delta$-rhombi and then extend to a $\delta$-rhombic tiling of $\mathbb R^2$ e.g. by periodicity. 

This question might seem too fuzzy, and if so, I will be happy to withdraw it. Until then, here it is: I know that a method of slowing a divergent series of positive reals is to replace the $n$-th term by it divided by the first $n$ terms. In this way the series obtained stays divergent, but it decreases infinitely faster. Now consider the class $\Sigma$ of divergent series made of positive reals, where $(a_i)<(b_i)$ means that $\lim_{i\to\infty}a_i/b_i=0$. Consider now a decreasing sequence of series. The question is if there is a notion of convergence fit to this order (most plausibly in a weak/generalized sense), and if there is an extension of $\Sigma$ where one could give some meaning to "the slowest divergent series". I suspect that the/some answer would have to do with something like nonstandard analysis: one might then reframe even the definition of the order relation, in the natural way.. I would highly appreciate other speculations about the statement of the problem too. 

Inspired by Will's answer of Integral of the entrywise square of the exponential of a matrix I realized that the above equation can also be computed by using the Kronecker product. Let $$M= A \oplus A \oplus A = A \otimes I_n \otimes I_n + I_n \otimes A \otimes I_n + I_n \otimes I_n \otimes A.$$ In terms of indices, this means: $$M_{i_1i_2i_3,j_1j_2j_3} = A_{i_1j_1}\delta_{i_2j_2}\delta_{i_3j_3} + \delta_{i_1j_1}A_{i_2j_2}\delta_{i_3j_3}+ \delta_{i_1j_1}\delta_{i_2j_2}A_{i_3j_3}$$ We have: $$\exp(Mt) = \exp(At)\otimes \exp(At) \otimes \exp(At).$$ In terms of indices this means that: $$\exp(Mt)_{i_1i_2i_3,j_1j_2j_3} = \exp(At)_{i_1,j_1}\exp(At)_{i_2,j_2}\exp(At)_{i_3,j_3}$$ In particular, $$ \int_0^\infty \exp(Mt)dt = -M^{-1},$$ which gives the solution to the above integral in $O(n^9)$. This can be easily generalized to higher order, with a complexity in $O(n^{3k})$. For $k=2$, it is less efficient than solving the Lyapunov equation (which can be done in $O(n^3)$). 

Let $A$ be a (finite) Hurwitz matrix. In this related question of mine, (see also $URL$ it is shown that $$ \int_0^\infty \sum_{j,k} (e^{At})_{ij} Q_{jk} (e^{At})_{\ell,k}dt = W_{i,\ell}, $$ where the matrix $W$ is the solution of some matrix equation $AW+WA^T+Q = 0$. Numerically, the solution of such an equation can be computed in $O(d^3)$, where $d$ is the dimension of my system. I am wondering if this result can be easily extended to multi-linear maps? In particular, is it possible to compute (numerically) the quantity $$ \int_0^\infty \sum_{j_1,j_2,j_3}Q_{j_1,j_2,j_3}(e^{At})_{i_1,j_1} (e^{At})_{i_2,j_2}(e^{At})_{i_3,j_3}dt $$ by an efficient procedure? Also, if we go to higher order, like $$ \int_0^\infty \sum_{j_1,j_2,\dots,j_k}Q_{j_1,\dots,j_k}(e^{At})_{i_1,j_1} \dots (e^{At})_{i_k,j_k}dt, $$ can we compute the solution of such an equation with a (relatively efficient) numerical procedure? If yes, how does its complexity grow with $k$? [EDIT] : after my answer below, there still remains a question whether a more efficient algorithm exists (like the Lyapunov equation for $k=2$). 

My approach would be to write your problem as a stochastic approximation algorithm. Let $f$ denote your drift: $$ f(x) := E[X_{n+1}-X_n | X_n=x]$$ and let $U_{n+1} = X_{n+1}-X_n-f(X_n)$. As $||X_{n+1}-X_k||$ is bounded, the variance of $U_{n+1}$ is finite. Moreover, $U_{n+1}$ is a martingale difference sequence (i.e. $E[U_{n+1}| F_n]=0)$. By the martingale central limit theorem, this implies that $\sum_{n=1}^n U_n$ is $O(\sqrt{n})$ for $n$ large. Now, you have $X_{n+1} = X_n + f(X_n) + U_n$. Developing this recurrence, you have: $$ X_{n+1} = X_0 + \sum_{k=1}^n f(X_k) + O(\sqrt{n})$$ If the drift $f(x)$ tends to sufficiently fast, this sum cannot grow linearly. 

Let $E$ have finite perimeter in $\mathbb R^n$. Consider the minimization of $$P(B)-\int_{\mathbb R^n\setminus L}|D\chi_E|$$ among the sets $B$ of finite perimeter differing from $E$ only inside $L$ (the negative piece of the minimized quantity is not influent, since it does not depend on $B$, but it's there to stress the idea that we care just about the perimeter inside $L$). Let $\bar E$ be the minimizer, and that the minimum is not zero. Suppose also that $L$ has finite perimeter. I'm looking for a geometrically inspired way for defining a function $\Psi$ which sends a piece (I would like to ask "all" but it might be unfeasible) of $\mathcal FL\cap E$ to $\mathcal F\bar E\cap L$ bijectively, is $H^{n-1}$-measurable and decreases (more precisely, does not increase) $(n-1)$-dimensional area. The idea should be that $\Psi$ be some kind of projection. In the case that $L$ is a ball and $E$ is a thin rectangle around its diameter it is clear that usual projections don't quite work. On the other hand, such a map surely exists, by the consideration that the area of the target is smaller than the one of the domain, and both of them are rectifiable. My question is if there is a famous geometric/constructive way of doing it, perhaps using some minimization principle, a flow, etc., or under more restrictive hypotheses on $L$. 

1) Is there a criterion for telling if a Lie-algebra-valued $2$-form (for example on a $SU(2)$-bundle) is a curvature, without taking derivatives? For example, using Bianchi's identity is not allowed. 2) Also partial criteria are welcome (i.e. ones in which just a necessary/sufficient condition, formulated without reference to derivatives of the "candidate" form, are given). 3) For example, is it true, for the trivial* $SU(2)$-bundle case, that having zero integer second chern class integral on all contractible domains implies that our form is a curvature? [*:correction suggested by David Speyer] 

edit At first, my simulation suggested that the exact value was $k/3$ but I am now convinced that it is $k/2$. Yet, the convergence speed to $k/2$ seems smaller than $1/\sqrt{k}$. When $n$ is large with respect to $k$, it seems that you can replace your problem by picking $k$ random variables $U_{i}$ uniform between 0 and 1. Then you want to find an interval that contains as few balls as possible. This can be easily simulated. You can also use this approach to show that your asymptotically, your expectation is between $k/2-\epsilon$ and $k/2$. The $k/2$ bound is obvious. For $k/4$, you know that the chosen interval will contains of the the fourth intervals [0,1/4], [1/4,1/2], [1/2,3/4] and [3/4,1]. Asymptotically, each interval will contain $k/4$ balls. Then, as Douglas pointed out, you can use more intervals to obtain $k/2-\epsilon$. Here is the python program that I used to simulate your problem: 

Take the log of everything (to replace product by sums); Use a Lagrangian relaxation to solve the problem. 

I just realized that the assertion that I was trying to prove is false because of the minus sign. In this case, it is not true even for deterministic sequences. If I replace the minus with a plus : $$E[X_{n+1}|F_n]\le a+\sum_{k=0}^nU_kX_k$$ then the proof used in $URL$ can be adapted to show that $$ E\left[\frac{X_T}{\prod_{k=0}^{T-1}(1+U_k)}\right] \le a $$ (the idea of the proof is to set $M_{n+1}=X_{n+1}-E[X_{n+1}|F_n]$ which is a martingale difference sequence. Then following $URL$ one obtain Equation (9) of $URL$ with a $L_n$ that is martingale difference sequence). I will try to provide more details later. 

By 1, your maximization problem is equivalent to the following concave maximization problem: $$\max \sum_{i\le n}Â \log (1 - (1-e^{a_i})^{y_i}) \text{ s.t.} \sum\log a_i=\log z.$$ In particular if all $y_i$ are constant, this implies that As for 2, you write your problem as: $$\max_a \sum_{i\le n} \log (1 - (1-e^{a_i})^{y_i}) + \lambda (\sum\log a_i-\log z)$$ Differentiating with respect to $a_i$ shows that $\log(1-(1-e^{a_i})^{y_i})=\lambda$. This implies that $(1-e^{a_i})^{y_i}$ is constant. In particular, if all $y_i$s are the same you get $x_i=(z)^{1/n}$. The minimization problem is not well defined (the value of the minimum is $0$ and is attained when one $x_i$ goes to $0$ while the over ones are maintained such that $\prod x_i=z$). 

It is well known that if $M$ is a smooth $(n-1)$-dimensional surface in $\mathbb R^n$ (e.g. a subspace) then there is a continuous trace operator $W^{s,p}(\mathbb R^n)\to W^{s-1/p,p}(M)$. Now suppose that $M$ is a manifold with boundary, e.g. $M=\{0\}\times\mathbb R^+\times \mathbb R^{n-2}\subset\mathbb R^n$, and in this case call the boundary $\Sigma:=\partial M=\{(0,0)\}\times\mathbb R^{n-2}$. The question (it's more a poll) is how to define the trace on $\Sigma$ (and I'd expect a function $W^{s,p}(\mathbb R^n)\to W^{s-2/p,p}(\Sigma)$) in such a way that the composed trace $$W^{s,p}(\mathbb R^n)\to W^{s-1/p,p}(M)\to W^{s-2/p,p}(\Sigma)$$ is independent of the (smooth) manifold $M$. Another (i.e. the more challenging) question is if you can (or prove it impossible to) find an example of two different compositions of linear continuous functionals as above (with two $M, M'$ smooth and with boundaries both equal to $\Sigma$, which by locality we suppose here to be orthogonal half-hyperplanes), without the requirement that the first functions $W^{s,p}(\mathbb R^n)\to W^{s-1/p,p}(M\:or\:M')$ be the usual traces, but such that then composed with the traces within $M, M'$ they give the codimension $2$ trace on $\Sigma$ of the first question. The question is inspired from a small book by Tartar ("An intorduction to Sobolev spaces and interpolation spaces", chapter 40) where (codimension one) trace spaces are identified with interpolation spaces, baiscally by parametrizing the "killed" spatial coordinate in $\mathbb R^n$ with the interpolation parameter. In the light of that construction it would appear that the reason why the first question should have a positive answer is because partial derivatives of linear functions commute: if no example could be done for the second question, it would (to me) indicate strongly that linearity is a die-hard property, so to speak. 

I would like to know whether or not there exists a finite probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb R^2$ which has no atoms, but such that there exists an uncountable set $A\subset \mathbb S^1$, such that for every $v\in A$ there exists $x_v\in \mathbb R^2$ such that $\mu(x_v+v\mathbb R)>0$. (A weaker requirement on $\mu$ would be that there exists an uncountable set of lines (i.e. affine $1$-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb R^2$) $L$ such that for each $\ell \in L$ there holds $\mu(\ell)>0$, so proving that no positive finite Radon measure $\mu$ satisfies this property, would imply a negative answer to my question.)
