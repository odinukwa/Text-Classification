A random $k$-coloring of the vertices of a graph $G$ is more likely to be proper than a random $(k-1)$-coloring of the same graph. (A vertex coloring is proper if no two adjacent vertices are colored identically. In this case, random means uniform among all colorings, or equivalently, that each vertex is i.i.d. colored uniformly from the space of colors.) 

For semiprimes, computing the Euler totient function is equivalent to factoring. Indeed, if n = pq for distinct primes p and q, then φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1) = pq - (p+q) + 1 = (n+1) - (p+q). Therefore, if you can compute φ(n), then you can compute p+q. However, it's then easy to solve for p and q because you know their sum and product (it's just a quadratic equation). If you believe factoring is hard for semi-primes, then so is computing the Euler totient function. Update! Factoring and computing the Euler totient function are known to be equivalent for arbitrary numbers, not just semiprimes. One reference is "Riemann's hypothesis and tests for primality" by Gary L. Miller. There, the equivalence is deterministic, but assumes a version of the Riemann hypothesis. See also section 10.4 of "A computational introduction to number theory and algebra" by Victor Shoup for a proof of probabilistic equivalence. 

If you want to think of $f$ in a way not too far from complex intuition, you should rather consider the induced morphism $\varphi$ from $X$ to the Berkovich affine line. If $x\in X$ then $\varphi(x)$ is the semi-norm $P\mapsto |P(f)(x)|$. 

By the way, my above proof shows in fact the following: if k is a non-trivially valued field, if A is a strictly affinoid k-algebra and if X is a finitely generated A-scheme of pure (Krull) dimension d, then X^an is also of pure dimension d. 

I think that any quasi-compact, non-empty sober topological space has a closed point (a topological space $X$ is sober if every irreducible closed subset of $X$ has a unique generic point; any scheme is sober). So, let $X$ be such a space. Let $\mathscr F$ be the set of irreducible closed subsets of $X$, ordered by reverse inclusion. The set $\mathscr F$ is inductive; indeed, let $(F_i)_{i\in I}$ be a totally ordered family of irreducible closed subsets of $X$. Let's first prove that its intersection is non-empty. If it were empty then by quasi-compactness (in its dual version, involving intersection of closed subsets), they would exist a finite subset $J$ of $I$ such that $\bigcap _{i\in J}F_i=\varnothing$. But then we get a contradiction: if $J=\varnothing$, then $\bigcap _{i\in J}F_i=X$ and the latter is non-empty by assumption; and if $J$ is non-empty, $\bigcap _{i\in J}F_i=F_i$ for some $i\in J$, hence is non-empty. Now if $x$ is a point in $\bigcap F_i$, then $\overline{\{x\}}$ is an irreducible closed subset of $X$ contained in all the $F_i$'s. Therefore $\mathscr F$ is inductive. It thus has a maximal element $G$. Since $X$ is sober, its closed irreducible subset $G$ has a unique generic point $\eta$. Let $x\in G$. By maximality of $G$ one has $\overline{\{x\}}=G$, and $x=\eta$. As a consequence, $G=\{\eta\}$ and $\eta$ is closed. 

Example. As in the previous example, let $E$ be a holomorphic line bundle over a Riemann surface $M$. By manipulating the Cauchy-Riemann equations, one can (I think!) classify the possible local rings of zeroes of a holomorphic section, and show that all of them have positive signature. Theorem 2 then yields an alternative proof of the quoted result that zeroes of holomorphic functions have positive degree. 

Here's an idea I had for trying to prove a theorem of the sort I ask for in Question 1. Recall the definition of the local ring of a zero $p\in M$ of a section of E: Write $\mathcal{O}_p$ for the ring of germs of smooth functions about $p$. Definition. Let $\sigma\in\Gamma(E)$ be a smooth section which vanishes at $p$. The local ring of the germ $[\sigma]_p$, denoted $Q([\sigma]_p)$, is the quotient $\mathcal{O}_p/([\sigma]_p)$, where $([\sigma]_p)$ is the ideal of $\mathcal{O}_p$ generated by "components of $\sigma$": $([\sigma]_p)=\ <\{[v(\sigma)]_p:v\text{ a nonvanishing section of }E^*\}> \ \subseteq \mathcal{O}_p$. Theorem 2 (Eisenbud-Levine-Khimshiashvili). Suppose $p$ is a zero of $\sigma$, and the local ring $Q([\sigma]_p)$ is a finite-dimensional algebra over $\mathbb{R}$. Then there is a canonical quadratic form on $Q([\sigma]_p)$, such that the degree of the zero of $\sigma$ at $p$ can be calculated as this quadratic form's signature. Because a system of PDE is precisely a constraint on the local behaviour of a section, it seems plausible that local rings of zeros of solutions of a PDE might have interesting properties. 

If you are sometimes called upon directing a random walk in a directed graph, how should you direct it so as to maximize the probability it goes where you want? Formal statement More specifically, suppose you are given a directed graph $G$ with edge weights, two designated vertices $s$ and $t$, and a subset of the vertices $S$. The edges weights represent the transition probabilities of the random walk, the vertex $s$ the start, the vertex $t$ the target, and the set $S$ the set of switches. You are guaranteed that the weights on the out-edges of any node are non-negative and sum to one, that $t$ is absorbing (i.e., $t$ has one out-edge directed towards itself), and that the out-degree of any vertex in $S$ is exactly two. A random walk is taken on $G$, starting at $s$. For any given vertex not in $S$, the weight on an out-edge is the probability that the walk will travel in that direction. Every time that the walk reaches a switch (a vertex in $S$), you are allowed to choose which of the two edges the walk will travel along (and you are allowed probabilistic strategies). How should you direct the path if you want to maximize the probability that the walk ends up at your target $t$? Questions I am most interested in this as an algorithmic question. How fast can you find the optimal strategy with respect to the size of the graph? My specific application has about 100 switches among 200 vertices in a fairly sparse graph (say out-degree bounded above by 6). But we can also ask purely mathematical questions. For example, my intuition says (and I can hand-wave a proof) that there exists an optimal strategy that is deterministic in the sense that it always chooses the same direction for a given switch and this direction does not depend on the initial vertex $s$. Is this actually true? Also, is there a sense in which the optimal strategy needs to "coordinate" among the switches? That is, is there a local optimum that is not a global optimum? Notes A note on connectivity: we may assume that the graph is sufficiently connected. If not, we can identify all vertices that cannot be reached from the start node, as well as all of those that cannot reach the target node, into a single, absorbing fail state. We may assume the start node is not the fail node. 

I agree this isn't completely obvious. Here's a slightly different take on it. Our intended vector bundle is $E/E' :=\coprod E_x/E'_x$, the disjoint union of the quotient vector spaces of fibres. We just need to specify the topology on it. We do this by describing a family of maps which we intend to be continuous local trivializations for the bundle. So, take a point $p\in B$, and a nhd $U$ of $p$ on which we have a frame $(e_1, \cdots e_{n+k})$ for $E$. Choose $1\leq i_1<\ldots< i_k\leq n+k$ such that on the fibre $p$, $E_p=E_p' + span(e_{i_1},\ldots e_{i_k})$. By the continuity of the determinant function, in fact there's a neighbourhood of $p$ on which this is true; that is, there's a (perhaps smaller) nhd $V$ of $p$ such that for all $x\in V$, $E_x=E_x' + span(e_{i_1},\ldots e_{i_k})$. So at each $x\in V$, we have a basis $(e_{i_1}+E_x',\ \ldots \ e_{i_k}+E_x')$ for $E_x/E'_x$. We demand that this collection of bases give a (continuous) frame for $E/E'$ over $V$. It's an easy check that the transition functions between two thus-constructed local trivializations are continuous, as required. 

EDIT: It was quickly pointed out by Anton Petrunin, Pietro Majer and Vitali Kapovitch that for the compact-open topology, the answer to the first question is no (and that the second question is vacuous). Is it possible that there is some finer topology on (perhaps some subspace of) the space of curves in a length space, for which the answer to these questions is yes? For instance, consider the following property that a length space $X$ (with length functional $\mathcal{L}$) might possess: 

Another term that has been used is "unilateral" or "unilaterally connected". I don't have a particularly strong opinion in favor of this terminology, but I am slightly opposed to just calling it "connected". (I usually assume "connected" means "weakly connected" for digraphs.) However, I must admit a reference by Tutte is good. Some references for "unilateral": 

I can't tell if that quote implies that both conditional and randomized polynomial-time algorithms exist, but it might (the exception that proves the rule?). Thanks in advance. 

Many people know that there is a (3×3) nine lemma in category theory. There is also apparently a sixteen lemma, as used in a paper on the arXiv (see page 24). There might be a twenty-five lemma, as it's mentioned satirically on Wikipedia's nine lemma page. Are the 4×4 and 5×5 lemmas true? Is there an n×n lemma? How about even more generally, if I have an infinity × infinity commutative diagram with all columns and all but one row exact, is the last row exact too? For all of these, if they are true, what are their exact statements, and if they are false, what are counterexamples? Note: There are a few possibilities for what infinity × infinity means -- e.g., it could be Z×Z indexed or N×N indexed. Also, in the N×N case, there are some possibilities on which way arrows point and which row is concluded to be exact. 

You're looking for a kind of bound on "parametrization badness", and this is perfectly reasonable, even if tricky to formulate. An $n$-submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^N$ is locally a graph of a function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^{N-n}$ (by selecting a suitable $n$-subspace of the ambient space). It is probably equivalent to bound the "badness" of these functions $f$. I would guess that bounds on mean curvature (and its higher derivatives) imply bounds on "graph badness"/"parametrization badness". For example, Propositions 3.2 and 5.1 of these notes on the Allard regularity theorem seem sort of similar (but again, talk to a geometric measure theorist!) I am an intrinsic geometer, not an extrinsic geometer, so my intuition here is coming from the corresponding theorems in the intrinsic case. A good reference is Section 1.2 of Hebey's book Sobolev Spaces on Riemannian Manifolds. Briefly, one has an abstract (not embedded) Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$, and one formulates a notion of "chart badness" as follows: for a chart $\varphi:V\to B$ (with $V\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$) whose image is some geodesic ball $B=B_x(r)\subseteq M$, the metric tensor is $C^{1,\alpha}$-controlled by $\epsilon$ in that chart if, letting $g_{ij}$ be the components of the metric tensor with respect to the chart, 

Then $(X,d,p)$ is (topologically) a smooth orbifold, whose singularities are of the form $\mathbb{R}^n/\Gamma$ for some finite $\Gamma\subseteq SO(n)$. I'm trying to get a sense of how sharp this statement is. Here's a possible converse. Question. Suppose I have a spherical space form $S^{n-1}/\Gamma$, and a $n$-manifold $M$ with boundary $\partial M = S^{n-1}/\Gamma$. Can I construct a sequence of complete Riemannian metrics on $M$'s interior, all satisfying the bounds above, such that some pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n/\Gamma$? A few remarks on what I know: I am aware of some standard constructions for particular $\Gamma$, such as the ALE hyperkähler metrics for $\Gamma\subseteq SU(2)$. However, I don't know any good general ways to construct a family of metrics satisfying two-sided Ricci bounds. 

Yes, there is a good notion of dimension, due to Berkovich and developed in my article, as mentioned in the two answers above. Concerning your question about GAGA principle for pure dimension, the answer is positive. I do not know whether it is explicitly written down in the litterature (I did not write it in my paper, for instance), but I can sketch the proof here. Since everything is invariant under ground field extension, you may assume that your ground field is not trivially valued. Now in order to prove that a strict analytic space is purely d-dimensional, it is sufficient to check that the dimension of O_X,x is equal to d for every rigid point x. But this can be checked after completion, and at a rigid point the analytic and algebraic local rings have the same completions, QED. Remark: there is certainly also GAGA for irreducible components (an irreducible scheme has an irreducible analytification) but it is not so easy to prove to my knowledge. Using normalization it can be reduced to GAGA for connectedness, for which I do not know any easy proof: one can compactify and use projective GAGA+Hartog's theorem, or use Berkovich's comparison theorem for étale cohomology at the H^0 level (!). Maybe there is a simpler one using Noether's normalization? 

Geometric motivation: By Clairaut's relation, if for some $T$, $$\int_c^{T}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt=\frac{\pi}{2},$$ then there are two three distinct geodesics between the points $(T,0, \tfrac{1}{2}T^2)$ and $(-T,0, \tfrac{1}{2}T^2)$ on the paraboloid of revolution $z=\tfrac{1}{2}r^2$: one through the point $(0,0,0)$, $(0, c, \tfrac{1}{2}c^2)$ and one through the point $(0, -c, \tfrac{1}{2}c^2)$. Edit: Deleted the comment about injectivity radius which concluded my original question -- it was false. Note that the answers of Nemo and Christian Remling, below, appear to work for any integration bound $T$, not just for $T=\pi/2$: for any $T>0$, $$\lim_{c\to 0^+}\int_c^{T}\frac{c}{t}\sqrt\frac{1+t^2}{t^2-c^2}dt=\frac{\pi}{2}.$$ 

There are plenty of "non-canonical" such forms, I think. For instance, pick a neighbourhood of the diagonal which is diffeomorphic to $TM$, and transfer the Mathai-Quillen Thom form on $TM$ to this neighbourhood using a suitable diffeomorphism. (By the way, the Mathai-Quillen Thom form on the total space of a bundle-with-metric-and-connection is the model I have in mind here for what "canonical" should mean -- a form whose value at each point depends only on local invariants.) Motivation: Such a form would yield a proof of the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem which is both quick and natural. Namely, $\chi(M)=PD(\Delta)\cup PD(\Delta)=\int_\Delta \eta_g =\tfrac{1}{(2\pi)^n}\int_M \text{Pf}(\text{Rm})$. 

I have not read it, but I think the article Heinzner-Loose, "Reduction of complex Hamiltonian G-spaces" (1994, link) may be the original reference for your first question. In the compact (but not necessarily projective) case, both questions are treated in Fujiki, "Kähler quotient and equivariant cohomology" (1994, link). I would also be interested in seeing a reference for the second fact in the non-compact case -- let me know if you find one!
