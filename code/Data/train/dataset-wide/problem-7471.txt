Note: This is a fairly precise and detailed question about an important but technical aspect of algebraic number theory. My answer is written at a level that I think is appropriate for the question; it assumes some familiarity with the topic at hand. 

The one-line answer to your question is the Sato--Tate conjecture. You might google this to find expository discussion, and looks in Serre's Abelian l-adic reps. book to find a proof in the context of elliptic curves modulo properties of motivic L-functions (now established -- by Clozel, Harris, Shepherd-Barron, Shin, and Taylor). There is an analog of Sato--Tate for any irreducible motive over a number field; precise statements are probably in one of the articles in the motives volumes. For this, and for other applications too, it is important that irreducible non-trivial motives (conjecturally) have $L$-functions with no pole; only the trivial motive contributes poles. For applications of the PNT for Dedekind zeta function, you might look at Hooley's proof of the Artin primitive root conjecture, conditional on GRH. (He needs GRH because he adds up an infinity of error terms, and needs a good enough estimate on them that he can still control their sum.) Added: Also, for Artin $L$-functions, the PNT is Cebotarev density (although this was actually proved earlier, and if I understand the history correctly, was a source of insipiration for Artin). For Dirichlet $L$-functions, it is Dirichlet's theorem on primes in arithmetic progression. Finally, let me remark that the condition that only the trivial motive (and its Tate twists) should give an $L$-functions with a pole (i.e. the only pole in $L$-functions should come from factors of the form $\zeta(s)$, or $\zeta(s + n)$) is a Fourier-theoretic condition, analogous to the theorem that for an irrep. of a group, the average value of the character is zero except for the trivial representation. (To understand what this means, examine Dirichlet's proof of this theorem, and see how the character-theoretic fact I just mentioned interacts with the study of the poles and zeroes of the $L$-functions.) (To be slightly more precise, one should combine this condition on poles with a corresonding condition on zeroes, namely that, after normalizing so that functional equation relates $s$ and $1 - s$, so that the critical line is $Re s = 1/2$, it should be the case that there are no zeroes on the line $Re s = 1$.) Added in response to Anweshi's comments: I should say that when I wrote Dirichlet's theorem and Cebotarev, I mean the quantative versions, giving correct asymptotics. 

In this answer I will treat the case in which $|\text{ }|$ is not discrete. I first claim that $\mathfrak m_0$ is not the restriction of any proper ideal in $k^{\infty}.$ Indeed, choose $x \in k$ such that $0 < |x| < 1$. Then $(x^i)$ is an element of $\mathfrak m_0$ which is invertible in $k^{\infty}$ (with inverse equal to $(x^{-i})$, and so $\mathfrak m_0$ generates the unit ideal of $k^{\infty}$. This doesn't contradict anything; the maximal ideals of $k^{\infty}$ pull-back to prime ideals in $\mathcal C(k)$ which are simply not maximal (as often happens with maps of rings). Furthermore, this pull-back is injective. To see this, we first introduce some notation; namely, we let $\mathfrak m\_{\mathcal U}$ denote the prime ideal of $k^{\infty}$ corresponding to the non-principal ultra-filter ${\mathcal U}$,and recall that $\mathfrak m\_{\mathcal U}$ is defined as follows: an element $(x_i)$ lies in $\mathfrak m\_{\mathcal U}$ if and only if $\{i \, | \, x_i = 0\}$ lies in in $\mathcal U$. Now suppose that $\mathcal U_1$ and $\mathcal U_2$ are two distinct non-principal ultra-filters. Let $A$ be a set lying in $\mathcal U_1$, but not in $\mathcal U_2$. Then $A^c$, the complement of $A$, lies in $\mathcal U_2$. Choose $x \in k$ such $0 < | x | < 1,$ and let $x_i = x^i$ if $i \in A$ and $x_i = 0$ if $i \not\in A$. Then $(x_i)$ is an element of $\mathcal C(k)$, in fact of $\mathfrak m_0$, and it lies in $\mathfrak m\_{\mathcal U_2}$ but not in $\mathfrak m\_{\mathcal U_1}$. Thus $\mathfrak m\_{\mathcal U_1}$ and $\mathfrak m\_{\mathcal U_2}$ have distinct pull-backs. So the map Spec $k^{\infty} \rightarrow $ Spec $\mathcal C(k)$ is injective and dominant (since it comes from an injective map of rings), but is not surjective. Choosing the valuation $|\text{ }|$ allows us to add to Spec $k^{\infty}$ (which is the Stone-Cech compactification of $\mathbb Z\_+$) an extra point dominating all the other points at infinity (i.e. all the non-principal ultrafilters), because the valuation now gives us a definitive way to compute limits (provided we begin with a Cauchy sequence). 

In the case of elliptic curves, integrating some fixed holomorphic differential over the first homology gives the lattice of periods of the corresponding elliptic functions. (These elliptic functions are certain meromorphic functions on $\mathbb C$ which are "doubly periodic", i.e. are invariant under $z \mapsto z + \omega$, where $\omega$ lies in the lattice of periods obtained as above.) This is the source of the terminology. 

Let $e \in A$ be a non-zero idempotent (and hence not nilpotent). Then if $f(e)$ is a unit, we find that $f(e) = 1,$ and so $f(e - 1) = 0.$ Thus if $e - 1$ generates (as a two-sided ideal) the entire ring, we find that $f$ is identically zero, and hence that $B = 0$. Thus, if we can find a non-zero idempotent $e \in A$ such that $A(1-e)A = A$, we have a counterexample. Note by the way that $f: = 1 - e$ is again idempotent, and so it suffices instead to find a non-unital idempotent $f$ such that $A f A = A$. E.g. If $A$ is simple (so that any non-zero two-sided ideal equals $A$), any non-unital and non-zero idempotent gives a counterexample. E.g. if $A = M_2(k)$ for some field $k$, and $f = (1 0 , 0 0)$, we are done. (I think this is what Kevin intended to write down in his comment.) 

To elaborate on Kevin's comment: If $f: X \to S$, and $\mathcal F$ is a sheaf on $X$, then $f\_*\mathcal F$ is the sheaf on $S$ defined by $H^0(U,f\_*\mathcal F) := H^0(f^{-1}(U),\mathcal F).$ Taking the derived functors of $f\_*$ gives functors $R^if\_*$, and it turns out (fairly easily) that $R^if\_*(\mathcal F)(U)$ is the sheaf associated to the presheaf $U \mapsto H^i(f^{-1}(U),\mathcal F)$. If $i > 0,$ then this presheaf may not be a sheaf (unlike the $i = 0$ case), and this is related to the fact that it can be a little subtle to compute the stalks of $R^if\_*\mathcal F$ in general; for example, it need not be the case in general that the stalk $(R^if\_*\mathcal F)_s$ is equal to $H^i(f^{-1}(s),\mathcal F)$. (E.g. think about the case when $f$ is the inclusion of a punctured disk into a disk, $\mathcal F$ is the constant sheaf ${\mathbb Z}$, and $s$ is the centre of the disk (so that $f^{-1}(s)$ is empty).) In other words, $R^if\_*\mathcal F$ does not always literally interpolate the cohomology of the fibres. There is one case where one knows that $R^if\_*\mathcal F$ does interpolate the cohomology of the fibres: if the map $f$ is proper, than the proper base-change theorem says that the stalk of $R^if\_*\mathcal F$ at $s$ is the cohomology of $\mathcal F$ along the fibre of $s$. (One good place for these kinds of facts is the beginning of Borel's book on Intersection Cohomology.) Also, in the context of maps of varieties, if $f$ is proper and $\mathcal F$ is a coherent sheaf, then the completed stalk of $R^if\_* \mathcal F$ at $s$ coicides with the cohomology of the pull-back of $\mathcal F$ to the formal completion of $f^{-1}(s)$ in $X$. (This is Grothendieck's proper base-change theorem, proved in some form in Hartshorne, Ch. III.) 

As for your original question, you should specify in what topology you want to consider your sheaves (Zariski or etale are the two possibilites that come to mind), and perhaps also what kind of sheaves you are thinking about (e.g. locally constant etale, coherent, ... ). E.g. the structure sheaf of Spec $L$ has a natural equivariant $Gal(L/K)$-structure, just given by the $Gal(L/K)$-action on $L$. (But note that the terminology here is much more complicated than the actual facts being discused: Spec $L$ is just a point, and so the $Gal(L/K)$-action is necessarily trivial on this point, and giving a sheaf is just the same as giving an abelian group (or set, or ..., depending on what sort of sheaves we are discussing). So giving a $Gal(L/K)$-equivariant sheaf is just giving an abelian group (or set, or ... ) with a $Gal(L/K)$-action.) Added: I see that in the time it took me to write this, it has been clarified that you mean etale sheaves. Note that if you are thinking of quasi-coherent $\mathcal O$-modules, then by (Grothendieck's interpretation of) Hilbert's Thm. 90, any sheaf is actually pulled back from the Zariski site, and so one can just think of Zariski sheaves. One natural requirement in the $\mathcal O$-module context is to ask that the $Gal(L/K)$-equivariant structure on the $\mathcal O$-module to be compatible with the given $Gal(L/K)$-equivariant structure on $\mathcal O$ (the structure sheaf of Spec $L$). It turns out that in this case any such sheaf is just pulled back from Spec $K$, as I will explain. By what I've already discussed above, to give a quasi-coherent sheaf on Spec $L$ with a $Gal(L/K)$-equivariant structure, compatible with the $\mathcal O$-module structure and the given equivariant structure on $\mathcal O$, we are just talking about $L$-vector spaces with a semi-linear action of $Gal(L/K)$. By Hilbert's thm. 90 again, any such vector space is in fact spanned by its $Gal(L/K)$-invariants (which are naturally a $K$-linear subspace), and so the $L$-vector space is of the form $L\otimes_K V$, where $V$ is a $K$-vector space, and the $Gal(L/K)$-action is just given by its action on the first factor. In terms of sheaves, this says that any such sheaf is pulled back from a quasi-coherent sheaf on Spec $K$. 

Dear Thomas, As far as I know, this work is not related directly to Galois representations, but is rather a particular calculation in the theory of $p$-adic modular forms (although it is not really described this way explicitly in the paper). The $p$-adic theory of modular forms of half-integral weight was developed in the 2004 Ph.D. thesis and subsequent papers of Nick Ramsey. (See Nick's comment below this answer, and the several papers available on his web-page.) The deduction of the results of Folsom--Kent--Ono from Ramsey's thesis is explained in a short note recently written by my colleague Frank Calegari. The key idea is that iterating the $U_{\ell^2}$ operator on a space of ($\ell$-adic) modular forms of half-integral weight projects to the ordinary part of the space, which is finite-dimensional and more-or-less explicitly computable. Applying this procedure to the modular form $1/\eta$ of weight $-1/2$ (recall that $1/\eta = q^{-1/24}\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^n)^{-1}$ is the generating function for partitions) gives the results of Folsom--Kent--Ono. [Added: The shift from $p$-adic to $\ell$-adic in the second paragraph is made just because in the work of Folsom--Kent--Ono, and so also in Calegari's note, the distinguished prime is called $\ell$. On the other hand, when talking about this area in general, people normally speak of $p$-adic modular forms rather than $\ell$-adic ones.] 

You could try looking at the first chapter of Mumford's book Abelian varieties. I forget whether or not it uses the word morphism, but it does adopt a resolutely complex analytic view-point, which will probably be (close to) the view-point you want. He begins with a discussion of complex tori, i.e. quotients of the form $\mathbb C^g/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is a lattice of rank $2g$, and then considers the problem of embeddding such a quotient into some complex projective space. The existence of such an embedding is what distinguishes abelian varieties from random complex tori, and is intimately related to the theory of theta functions. (Indeed, theta functions provide the embedding.) I think that Mumford probably does use the terminology of line bundles. Line bundles and their sections come into the picture because to give an embedding of some variety $X$ into projective space, you need (more-or-less) to choose some homogeneous coordinates on $X$. But since the homogeneous coordinates of a point are not quite well-defined (they are only well-defined up to a scalar) the homogeneous coordinates are not quite functions, but only functions well-defined up to a certain scalar transformation, which exactly makes them be sections of a line bundle. In the case of abelian varieties, you can pull these sections back from $\mathbb C^g/\Lambda$ to $\mathbb C^g$, where they do become honest functions, but instead of being invariant under $\Lambda$ (if they were invariant under such translations, they would descend to be honest functions on the abelian variety $\mathbb C^g/\Lambda$, which they are not), they transform by some scalar when you translate the argument by an element of $\Lambda$. When you figure out exactly what the right scalar transformation law is, you find that you are talking about theta-functions! My memory is that Mumford does explain this fairly concretely in his first chapter. Even if it doesn't stand alone as an explanation, it may be a helpful bridge between the very classical description that you are likely to find most accessible, and the view-point that you will find in most of the modern mathematical literature. Let me add that (at least in my view) follow-up questions about specific points of the theory (say in reference to one of the texts that you ultimately decide to look at) would be quite welcome. 

First note that if $p_1:Y_1 \to X$ and $p_2:Y_2 \to X$ are two etale spaces over $X$ then any morphism of etale spaces $f:Y_1 \to Y_2$ (where by morphism of etale spaces I mean that $f$ is continuous and that $p_2\circ f = p_1$) makes $Y_1$ an etale space over $Y_2$. (Proof: Let $y \in Y_1$, and let $V$ be a n.h. of $f(y)$ in $Y_2$ such that $p_2:V \to p_2(V)$ is a homeo. Note that a local homeo. is open by definition, and so $p_2(V)$ is also open in $X$. Now $f^{-1}(V)$ is an open subset of $Y_1$ containing $y$, and so we may find a n.h. $U$ of $y$ in $Y_1$, contained in $f^{-1}(V)$, such that $p_1: U \to p_1(U)$ is a homeo. Since $p_1 = p_2\circ f$, and since $f(U) \subset V$, we find that $f: U \to f(U)$ is a homeo. and that $f(U)$ is open in $Y_2$. Thus $f$ is a local homeo., as required.) Now suppose that $f_1,f_2:Y_1 \rightarrow Y_2$ are two morphisms of etale spaces, and that $f_1(y) = f_2(y)$ for some $y \in Y_1$. Then $f_1$ and $f_2$ coincide in some n.h. of $y$. (Proof: Choose some sufficiently small n.h. $V$ of $f_1(y) = f_2(y)$ in $Y_2$ such that $p_2:V \to p_2(V)$ is a homeo. Then choose a n.h. $U$ of $y$ contained in $f_1^{-1}(V) \cap f_2^{-1}(V)$ such that $f_i:U \to f_i(U)$ is a homeo. for both values of $i$. Since each $f_i(U)$ is contained in $V$, we see that $p_2: f_i(U) \to p_2\circ f_i(U) = p_1(U)$ is a homeo. as well, and hence that $p_1 = p_2\circ f_i: U \to p_1(U)$ is a homeo. We then find that, on $U$, the map $f_i$ (for either value of $i$) can be computed as the composite of $p_1:U \to p_1(U)$ and $p_2^{-1}: p_1(U) \to f_i(U) \subset V$. Thus the two maps $f_i$ coincide on $U$.) Now if $p:Y \to X$ is an etale space and $\sigma$ is a section, we can think of $\sigma$ as a morphism from the etale space $X \to X$ (i.e. $X$ thought of as the trivial etale space over itself) to the etale space $Y \to X$. The preceding result then shows that if two sections coincide at a point, they coincide in a n.h. of that point. 

Regarding point (2) in the question, I believe that Grothendieck's proof involves choosing a $f_i$ and $g_i$ in $A$ such that $\sum_i f_i g_i = 1$ (in other words, a cover of Spec $A$ by open sets of the form Spec $A_{f_i}$), computing the cohomology Cech-wise (which amounts to consider a Koszul complex), and then taking the limit over all such covers and using the Cech-to-sheaf-cohomology spectral sequence to conclude. So this is certainly an argument in the spirit of partitions of unity arguments. 

Dear Kevin, My understanding of the current meromorphic continuation results is that they do something along the lines of expressing a given Galois representation as the induction of a virtual (i.e. positive and negative coefficients) combination of various automorphic Galois representations. To get true automorphy, it seems that one might need to know: a very general result about automorphic induction, and also replace virtual combination by true combination (i.e. only positive coefficients). Since automorphic induction is supposed to be true, the first issue is only an indiction of the possible difficulty of the issue, not an intrinsic obstruction. But won't it be the case that any virtual Galois representation will give rise to an $L$-function with meromorphic continuation, which in general won't be holomorphic? So isn't this a genuine obstruction to concluding automorphy just from meromorphic continuation? One needs an extra ingredient which measures the true, as opposed to merely virtual, nature of the Galois representation; as far as I understand, at the moment the only such ingredient that people know how to feed into converse theorems is holomorphic continuation, rather than meromorphic continuation, of some $L$-function(s). Cheers, Matt 

The motive $L$ is called Lefschetz because it is the cycle class of the point in ${\mathbb P}^1$, and so underlies (in a certain sense) the Lefschetz theorems about the cohomology of projective varieties. To understand this better, you may want to read about how the hard Lefschetz theorem for varieties over finite fields follows from the Riemann hypothesis, as well as a discussion of Grothendieck's standard conjectures and how they relate to the Weil conjectures. The motvie $L^{-1}$, when converted into an $\ell$-adic Galois representation, is precisely the $\ell$-adic Tate module of the roots of unity. Tensoring by this Galois representation is traditionally called Tate twisting, and so the motive underlying this Galois representation is called the Tate motive. One needs to have $L^{-1}$ at hand in order for the category to admit duals. If one were working with just usual singular cohomology, this wouldn't be necessary; Poincare duality would pair $H^i$ with $H^{\text{top}-i}$ into $H^{\text{top}}$, which would be isomorphic with ${\mathbb Q}$ via the fundamental class. But motivically, if $X$ (smooth, connected, projective) has dimension $d$, so that the top dimension is $2d$, then $H^{\text{top}} = L^{\otimes d}$, and so $H^i$ and $H^{2d-i}$ pair into $L^{\otimes d}$. To get a pairing into $\mathbb Q$ (the trivial 1-dim'l motive) we need to be able to tensor by powers of $L^{-1}$. Traditionally tensoring by the $n$th tensor power of $L^{-1}$ is denoted $(n)$; so we find e.g. that $H^i$ pairs with $H^{2d -i}(d)$ into ${\mathbb Q}$, and we have our duality. You can see from the fact that cup product pairs cohomology into powers of $L$ that inverting $L$ is precisely what is needed in order to obtain duals. Finally, one should think of $L$ as the fundamental class of a curve, think of $L^{\otimes d}$ as the fundamental class of a smooth projective $d$-dimensional manifold, and also become comfortable with Poincare duality and the Lefschetz theorems; these are the basic ideas which will help give solid geometric sense to motivic constructions.
