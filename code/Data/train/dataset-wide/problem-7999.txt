Of course the first question one asks is whether this definition agrees with the one due to Inna Zakharevich, that Clark Barwick linked to in a comment. 

For question two, you are asking about a composition of two Schur functors, i.e. a plethysm. More specifically you want to know $h_2 \circ h_k$ and $h_2 \circ e_k$. These can be found in Example 9 in the section on plethysm in Symmetric functions and Hall polynomials: $$ h_2 \circ h_k = \sum_{j \text{ even}} s_{(2k-j,j)}$$ and $$ h_2 \circ e_k = \sum_{j \text{ even}} s_{(k+j,k-j)^T}$$ where $(\cdot)^T$ denotes the transposed Young diagram, and the sum is taken over those even $j$ that make the subscript a valid Young diagram. These translate to universal identities between representations, i.e. an isomorphism of functors. They express how the composed functors $\mathrm{Sym}^2(\mathrm{Sym}^k(-))$ and $\mathrm{Sym}^2(\bigwedge^k(-))$ can be written as direct sums of Schur functors. When you apply a Schur functor to the defining representation of $\mathrm{SU}(n)$, the result is nonzero if and only if the corresponding partition has at most $n$ parts. Think about how the functor $\bigwedge^k$ vanishes on any vector space of dimension less than $k$. This explains the observation you make in a comment below, that not all terms in the second sum will appear if $n$ is small. 

There is the following characterisation. I don't think it's too tautological. Let $T \subseteq A$ be the set of f such that the induced map $A[f^{-1}] \to B[f^{-1}]$ is an isomorphism. Then $\mathrm{Spec}(B) \to \mathrm{Spec}(A)$ is an open immersion if and only if the image of $T$ in $B$ generates the unit ideal. 

Let $\mathsf{MM}(\mathbf C)$ be the hypothetical category of mixed motives over the complex numbers, and consider the realization functor $\Phi : \mathsf{MM}( \mathbf C) \to \mathsf{MHS}$ to integral mixed Hodge structures. Is $\Phi$ expected to be faithful? If not, what kind of information does one expect to lose? 

I am not sure what kind of answer you are looking for. But if you have a stack $X$, then the inertia stack $IX$ is basically the gadget parametrizing pairs $(x,\sigma)$ where $x$ is a point of $X$ and $\sigma$ is in the isotropy group at $x$ (an automorphism of $x$). Informally, the locus where you have automorphism group $G$ becomes "doubled" $|G|$ times. Example: for the stack $[\mathbb A^1/\mu_2]$ the inertia stack is $[\mathbb A^1/\mu_2] \sqcup B\mu_2$, the extra $B\mu_2$ corresponding to the origin being doubled because it has an extra automorphism. One way to think about it is as a kind of "infinitesimal loop space", where instead of taking maps to $X$ from a circle we take maps from the homotopically equivalent object $B\mathbb Z$. This is pleasant because the inertia stack is the fibered product $X \times_{X\times X} X$, and for a topological space $X$ the homotopy fibered product $X \times_{X\times X}^h X$ is the space of free loops on $X$. You can motivate the inertia stack through Gromov--Witten theory. If $X$ is a variety, then there is an evaluation map from the stack of stable $n$-pointed maps to $X$ to $X^n$. If $X$ is a stack, then the correct notion is that of a twisted stable map, and in this case the evaluation maps do not land on $X$ but in its inertia stack $IX$! (In fact it lands on the rigidified inertia stack, where some automorphisms have been removed from the picture, but nevermind this). So quantum cohomology of a stack is not extra structure on the cohomology ring of $X$ itself, but on the cohomology ring of $IX$. 

No. If $E$ and $E'$ are distinct isogenous elliptic curves, say over a field of characteristic zero, then $[E]-[E'] \neq 0$ in the Grothendieck ring of varieties (as explained e.g. in Bjorn Poonen's paper on zero divisors in the Grothendieck ring of varieties), but $E$ and $E'$ define isomorphic motives. 

Although your question has been answered several times over, the following simple argument also works in quite some generality: since the (compactly supported) Euler characteristic satisfies the scissor relation $\chi(X) = \chi(X \setminus Z) + \chi(Z)$ whenever Z is a closed subscheme of X, removing a point (or any subscheme whose Euler characteristic is nonzero) will produce a variety with different Euler characteristic. By allowing the Euler characteristic to take more "exotic" values, e.g. in the Grothendieck ring of Galois representations, you can rule out almost all cases where Z has Euler characteristic zero, too. 

Let $\mathbb E$ denote the rank $g$ Hodge bundle on $\overline M_g$, the moduli space of stable curves of genus $g$. It is a nef vector bundle. I wonder what other positivity properties the Hodge bundle has. Is it semi-ample? If so, can one bound the $k$ for which $\mathbb E$ is $k$-ample? 

There is an explanation of sorts in Section 1.4 of Elkies's "The Klein quartic in number theory". There is a three-dimensional lattice $L$ over the cyclotomic field $k=\mathbf Q(\zeta_7)$, and $G$ can be defined as its group of isometries. The resulting three-dimensional representation of $G$ has the unusual property of remaining irreducible when reduced modulo every prime of $\mathcal O_k$. Its reduction modulo a prime over $2$ turns out to be $\mathrm{GL}(3,\mathbf F_2)$ acting on $\mathbf F_2^3$, and its reduction modulo a prime over $7$ is $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbf F_7)$ acting on $\mathbf F_7^3$ as the symmetric square of the two-dimensional representation of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbf F_7)$. (Note that since $-1$ acts trivially on the symmetric square, the symmetric square really is a projective representation.) 

Yes, it should be fine. Orientability is used to show that the locally constant sheaves $R^i f_\ast \mathbf Z$ occuring in the Leray spectral sequence are actually constant along the diagonals of $X^n$, where $f \colon F(X,n) \hookrightarrow X^n$ is the inclusion. This is true mod 2 without the orientability assumption. Note also that the generators $G_{ij}$ in Totaro's results come from the locally euclidean structure on $X$. You therefore need to observe that $H^\bullet(F(\mathbf R^m,n),\mathbf Z)$ is torsion free, so that $H^\bullet(F(\mathbf R^m,n),\mathbf Z/2) \cong H^\bullet(F(\mathbf R^m,n),\mathbf Z) \otimes \mathbf Z/2$, in order to carry out the same local calculation Totaro makes also in the mod 2 case. 

For $g > 2$ you're not going to be able to write such invariants as global functions on the moduli space. In general for an algebraic variety $X$, there is a canonical morphism $a \colon X \to \mathrm{Spec}(H^0(X,\mathcal O_X))$, the affinization of $X$. Points $x$ and $y$ of $X$ are separated by some global regular function if only if $a(x) \neq a(y)$. So your question can only have a positive answer if the affinization morphism is injective (so $M_g$ is affine or quasi-affine). Now $M_2$ is affine, but $M_g$ for $g >2$ contains a complete curve. Since a regular function restricted to a complete subvariety is constant, this means that $a$ has positive dimensional fibers. In fact one can prove using the Satake compactification that through any two points of $M_g$ passes a complete curve, if $g>2$. So the affinization is in fact a point. This is also why in the $g=3$ case of David Lehavi's answer there are only such choices of invariants on the hyperelliptic locus and on the non-hyperelliptic locus separately. Both loci are affine, but their union is not. It also seems relevant to mention that $M_g$ is of general type for $g \gg 0$, so that there will be no rational parametrization of the set of genus $g$ curves. And it also seems relevant to mention Fenchel--Nielsen coordinates: these will give you local real-analytic coordinates around any point of the moduli stack in any genus. 

To generalize to a local system we need a suitable formalism of mixed sheaves. Since you have $\mathbf Q$-coefficients it looks like you're working over $\mathbf C$ so we should use Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules. Then all these remain true with coefficients in $E$ instead. For the first one, Saito proves that the perverse Leray sequence degenerates for a proper morphism and a pure Hodge module. For a morphism which is in addition smooth the perverse Leray sequence is just the ordinary one, and if $E$ is a PVHS then it's a pure Hodge module. For the second it is enough to prove dually that $\mathrm{gr}^W_{n+k} H^n_c(X,E) \to \mathrm{gr}^W_{n+k} H^n_c(\overline X, E)$ is injective (where $k$ is the weight of the sheaf $E$). But the long exact sequence of a pair identifies the kernel of this map with a quotient of $\mathrm{gr}^W_{n+k} H^{n-1}_c(\overline X \setminus X,E)$ which vanishes by the fact that $Rf_!$ decreases weights. (For a more general statement see Peters and Saito, "Lowest weights in cohomology of variations of Hodge structure".) The third follows because $H^0(S,R^nf_\ast E)$ injects into $H^n(X_s,E)$ (as the monodromy invariants) which is pure because $X_s$ is smooth and proper and because the restriction of $E$ to $X_s$ is still pure, again everything is due to Saito's theory. 

Here is how I think about G-R-R in the context of moduli of curves. I realize now that I wrote something quite long. Let me recall first the definition of the tautological ring. As a consequence of the results on the birational geometry of $\overline M_g$ that there is no hope of understanding the whole Chow ring of $\overline M_g$ -- for instance, unlike in misleading low genus examples, the Chow ring will in general be infinite-dimensional. In David Mumford's "Towards an enumerative geometry..." he he introduces a finite-dimensional subring of the Chow ring which contains all "geometrically natural" classes in the Chow ring and proposes studying it instead, and this subring is called the tautological ring. Let me quote: "Whenever a variety or topological space is defined by some universal property, one expects that by virtue of its defining property, it possesses certain cohomology classes called tautological classes. The standard example is a Grassmannian [...] by its very definition, there is a universal bundle $E$ on Grass of rank $k$, and this induces Chern classes $c_l(E)$ in both the cohomology ring and Chow ring of Grass." Let me expand on the meaning of "geometrically natural". There are several possible definitions of the tautological ring. The one used by Mumford is that it is the subring generated by the so-called $\kappa$-classes, which is not really the right one: you should also for instance consider the boundary divisors as tautological classes (but this is implicit already in Mumford's paper). A nice definition is the one of Faber and Pandharipande, which defines the tautological ring for all spaces $\overline M_{g,n}$ simultaneously: it is the minimal system of subrings which contains all fundamental classes, is closed under all gluing morphisms, and is closed under all forgetting points-morphisms. Morally what this means is that: (i) for any "natural" bundle you can write down directly in terms of the moduli functor, its Chern classes are going to be tautological; (ii) any sort of "natural" gluing procedure on curves is going to keep you inside of the tautological ring. For example, the $\lambda$-classes (Chern classes of the Hodge bundle) are tautological, the $\psi$-classes are tautological (the line bundles given by the cotangent line at a marked point), and the $\kappa$-classes are tautological. OK, so let us return to G-R-R. Let $f \colon X \to Y$ be a proper morphism. On one side of the equation you have the Chern character of the derived pushforward $Rf_\ast F$. On the other side you have the pushforward of the Chern character of $F$ and the Todd class of the relative tangent sheaf $T_f$. The point is that both $F$, $Rf_\ast F$ and $T_f$ can all be made sense of by working locally/fiberwise: we don't need to know anything about the global structure of $Y$ to apply G-R-R to $f$ and $F$. But this is also how the tautological ring was set up: the classes in the tautological ring are exactly those that can be defined by pushing around classes of "fiberwise" defined bundles, which means that these are exactly the classes that can be defined without making any reference to any "global" structure of the moduli space. So in hindsight Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch seems tailor made for the study of tautological rings. On the other hand, this is also a limitation of G-R-R: it will produce lots of relations and identities relating tautological classes to each other, but it will never prove any "global" statement about any of them. As an example, it is possible to algorithmically compute the intersection number on $\overline M_{g,n}$ for any polynomial in boundary strata and $\lambda$-, $\psi$- and $\kappa$-classes. First you express the $\kappa$-classes as pushforwards of $\psi$-classes, then G-R-R can be used to express the $\lambda$-classes in terms of pushforwards of $\psi$-classes, which will finally reduce your computation to an intersection number only involving $\psi$-classes. All this was completely formal, but sooner or later you are going to need to use some global geometric property of $\overline M_{g,n}$ to find an actual number, and this is where it comes in: the Witten conjecture/Kontsevich's theorem tells you how to compute any intersection of $\psi$-classes. So let me finally talk a bit about the article of Harris and Mumford. The first application of G-R-R in their article is to derive the formula $K_{\overline{M}_g} = 13\lambda_1 - 2\delta_0 - 3\delta_{1} - \ldots - 2\delta_{n}$ in the tautological ring. This is done by applying GRR to the projection from the universal curve and truncating after the first term. Incidentally, if you don't truncate after the first term, you get Mumford's formula (derived in "Towards an enumerative geometry...") expressing the Chern character of the Hodge bundle in terms of $\kappa$-classes and pushforwards of $\psi$-classes from the boundary strata. But again, GRR will not tell you any global geometric information like if a class is big or ample. The idea is then to find an effective divisor $D$ such that $mK_{\overline M_g} = D + a\lambda_1$ with $a > 0$. It turns out that this is possible for $D$ equal to the locus of $k$-gonal curves, where they pick $g = 2k-1$. They describe in the article how they came up with this particular choice of $D$ by trying to generalize the work of Freitag on the Kodaira dimension of $A_g$ for $g$ large, in particular I think that there should be a Siegel modular form whose pullback to $M_g$ conjecturally would have $D$ as its vanishing locus. I don't know if this was actually worked out in later work. Then $nK_{\overline M_g}$ for large enough $n$ defines a birational map using the fact that $\lambda_1$ is ample on $A_g$, ultimately because the Satake compactification is the Proj of the ring of Siegel modular form, i.e. the sections of powers of the determinant of the Hodge bundle. (However $\lambda_1$ is not ample on $\overline M_g$!) This part is clarified by the later article of Cornalba and Harris showing that a linear combination $a\lambda - b\delta$ is ample if and only if $a > 11b$. The rational Picard group of $\overline M_g$ is generated by $\lambda_1$ and the boundary divisors, so any effective divisor has an expression of the form $a\lambda - \sum b_i \delta_i$, so estimating the Kodaira dimension of $\overline M_g$ really comes down to finding effective divisors such that the slopes $a/b_i$ are small. Anyway, the second application of GRR in their article is to show that on the open part $M_g$, the $k$-gonal locus is a multiples of $\lambda_1$. Actually, this part uses even more crucially Porteous's formula: once they express $k$-gonality in terms of a morphism of bundles having lower than expected rank, the class of the $k$-gonal locus can be expressed in terms of Chern classes of the two bundles, i.e. in terms of tautological classes. It follows then that $D$ is the sum of a multiple of $\lambda_1$ and an integral linear combination of boundary divisors. Finally these integers are determined by evaluating the divisors on suitable "test curves". They conclude that $\overline M_g$ is of general type for big $g$.
