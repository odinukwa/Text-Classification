If $M \to X$ is smooth and proper, and $M$ is K\"ahler, then the fibers are all symplectomorphic. (Proof: the Levi-Civita connection generates symplectomorphisms.) The family of elliptic curves was already mentioned, but another interesting one has every general fiber being $F_0$ and the special fiber $F_2$ (Hirzebruch surfaces). A curious example is the family $\{ xy = t \}$ of hypersurfaces in ${\mathbb C}^2$ as $t$ varies (away from $0$). There, the fibers are all holomorphic, and symplectomorphic, but not by the same diffeomorphism (their unique closed geodesics are of varying length). 

On $G/B$, the divisor $\bigcup_\alpha X_{r_\alpha}$ is Cartier (where $X_w := \overline{B_- w B}/B$, and $\alpha$ varies over simple roots), not least because $G/B$ is smooth. 

think there are two questions here: (1) why study the prime spectrum, and (2) why think of it in terms of the axioms for a topology. (1) has been pretty well handled by other commenters. And a number of them point out that (2) isn't really especially useful. Part of the problem, according to a very interesting article I read by Grothendieck (maybe where he introduces dessins d'enfants?), is that the axioms for topological spaces are "wrong". Alas, he doesn't know what the right axioms are; he's just sure that the field of general topology should never have existed. From that point of view, discovering that the prime spectrum has a topology automatically isn't that interesting. (This guy has a contrary viewpoint on the field of general topology, but unsurprisingly I find Grothendieck more convincing.) 

Let a connected algebraic group $G$ (over $\mathbb C$, say) act Hamiltonianly on an algebraic symplectic variety $M$, with moment map $\Phi: M\to \mathfrak g^*$. In the example I care about, vaguely related to Slodowy slices, $G$ is unipotent. 

If $G$ is compact, then as explained in comments $G/ad$ is $T/W$. If further $G$ is simply-connected, hence a product of simple factors, then $T/W$ is a corresponding product of simplices. The point is that $T/W = ({\mathfrak t}/\Lambda)/W = {\mathfrak t}/(\Lambda \rtimes W)$, where $\Lambda$ is the kernel of the exponential map ${\mathfrak t}\to T$, and when $G$ is simply connected this latter group is an affine reflection group (the affine Weyl group, or at least, the product of those of the simple factors) whose fundamental chamber is the product of simplices. 

There's a generalization of Morse-Bott called Morse-Bott-Kirwan that you can read about in Kirwan's book. Basically this condition guarantees that the unstable sets are manifolds, but not the stable sets, so the negative of a function that's Morse-Bott-Kirwan may not be. If one defines a "Yang-Mills functional" very generally to be the norm-square of a moment map, Kirwan proves that for $M$ finite-dimensional, this norm-square is a perfect Morse-Bott-Kirwan function. (Of course the original example of such is on $M$ a space of connections, where Atiyah-Bott did the same, as I recall.) 

This is a purely algebraic answer, so maybe not what you're looking for. What would an inner product on a left $A$-module $M$ over a noncommutative algebra $A$ be? It should give a map $M \to M^*$ where $M^* = Hom_A(M,A)$, but that's a right $A$-module. We can teach it to be a left $A$-module again, if we have a chosen anti-automorphism $i:A\to A$. Eventually we'd like the natural function $M \to M^{**}$ to be $A$-linear, probably, so we should also ask that $i$ be an involution. If $A = \mathbb C$ then there are two (continuous) such $i$: the identity, and the complex conjugate. I claim that the latter is the more natural one, or at least that this isn't crazy. If you think of $\mathbb C = \left\{\begin{pmatrix} a&b\\ -b&a \end{pmatrix} : a,b\in \mathbb R\right\}$, then (1) it's weird that $\mathbb C$ is commutative, since matrices shouldn't commute, and (2) $i$ is transpose. If you go up to $A = \mathbb H$ then you no longer have this weird choice of $i = $ identity available. But transpose still works (thinking of $A$ as certain $4\times 4$ real matrices). Anyway, if you now unwind the $A$-linearity of $M \to M^*$, where $A=\mathbb C$ and $i(z) = \overline{z}$, you get sesquilinearity. 

All right, here's a case where thinking about it for a few days isn't enough to prod inspiration, but embarassing oneself in public is. I'm glad and actually, surprised I haven't done this on MO before. Since $S$ is contained in $V$ and $W$ hence in $M$, we can mod out by $S$ to reduce to the case $S=0$. Since $W$ is contained in $\pi^{-1}(Q)$ where $\pi: M \to M/V$, we can shrink $M$ to $\pi^{-1}(Q)$ to reduce to the case $Q = M/V$. Put together, the question is whether there's a submodule $W \leq M$ complementary to $V$, or whether the map $M \to M/V$ has an $A$-linear section. Pulled back apart, the question is whether the map $\pi^{-1}(Q)/S \to \pi^{-1}(Q)/V = Q$ has a section. I'm going to take this as an answer. Here's an example, to help expiate my sin. Let $A = k[x]$, $M = A/\langle x^2 \rangle$, and $V = xM$. Then the only $1$-d $A$-submodule of $M$ is $V$. There are two graded $1$-d submodules of $gr\ M$, namely $0 \oplus M/V$ and $V \oplus 0$ (the liftable one). Applying the criterion to the first of these two, we're looking for a section of $M \to M/V$, and there isn't one. To the second, we're looking for a section of $0 \to 0$, and there is. 

Let $V$ be an irrep for a regular dominant weight, and $\vec v$ a high weight vector. Then the $G$-stabilizer of $k\vec v \in {\mathbb P}V$ is $B$, so the $G$-orbit is $G/B$. I guess I need a bit more thought to say why it's closed, but I'm not sure this will really be different enough from your proofs above to bear thinking about. 

Bi- (or sesqui-) linear forms are nicer if they're nondegenerate. But they can always be restricted to subspaces. So, they're even nicer if they're nondegenerate on all subspaces. For symmetric forms on ${\mathbb R}^n$, that forces definiteness (positive or negative). The usual bilinear form on ${\mathbb C}^n$ doesn't have this inherited-nondegeneracy property, but the Hermitian one does. Anyway that's a practical issue, rather than a naturality statement. One way to decide it is natural is to embed $M_n({\mathbb C})$ into $M_{2n}({\mathbb R})$ by using the obvious $\mathbb R$-basis of ${\mathbb C}^n$. This fills the $2n\times 2n$ matrix with lots of $2\times 2$ real matrices whose transposes correspond to complex conjugate. Transposes come up in dot products if you notice that $\langle v,w\rangle$ is the unique entry in the $1\times 1$ matrix $v^T w$. 

Extend one component of the Dynkin diagram to its affine diagram, by attaching the lowest root. From that component, remove one or more vertices. (If you want to stay semisimple, remove only one.) Repeat to taste. (If you want to stay semisimple, and you're at a disjoint union of $A_m$ diagrams, then you're definitely done.) 

Example: consider $1 \stackrel{1}{\to} 2 \stackrel{2}{\to} 3$, with matrix $ \begin{pmatrix} -1&0\\ 1&-1\\ 0&1 \end{pmatrix}$. Then the three choices $v=1,2,3$ give the determinants $1,-1,1$ respectively. 

This is more reasonable if you insist that $C$ have a given Hilbert polynomial. Otherwise, consider the case $A = \emptyset$, $B = \bf P = \bf P^2$. Then you have curves of every degree, so your $V(A,B)$ will be of infinite type. With $C$'s Hilbert polynomial fixed, the natural thing to look at is the subschemes $C$ between $A$ and $B$. This defines a closed subscheme $X$ of the Hilbert scheme of $\bf P$ with this chosen Hilbert polynomial, so in particular is projective. (I get the impression from your question that you need to learn about Hilbert schemes, from e.g. Eisenbud and Harris.) If you only want varieties, then you're thinking about an open subscheme $V(A,B)$ of that $X$. Given how badly behaved Hilbert schemes are, I doubt it $V(A,B)$ will be irreducible, and I suspect figuring out the dimensions of its components will be quite intractable in general. 

A codimension $d$ face of a polytope is called rationally smooth if it lies on only $d$ facets, because this is exactly the condition for the corresponding toric variety to have only orbifold singularities (not worse) there. Is there some good reason that the moment polytope of a full flag manifold $G/B$ should have only smooth faces? It's easy to prove, and it doesn't hold for partial flag manifolds like $Gr(2,4)$ (whose moment polytope is an octahedron). Both of these varieties are smooth, of course, and neither is a toric variety; what the rational smoothness of the faces tells you is that the normalization of a generic $T$-orbit closure in the full flag manifold is orbifold, and in a Grassmannian it's not. [Added: in general, if $X$ carries an algebraic action of a torus $T$, then $\overline{T\cdot x}$ for a generic $x\in X$ will be a variety with the same moment polytope as $X$. That doesn't make it a toric variety under Fulton's book's definition, as it may not be normal.] Is there any other reason to predict that a given Hamiltonian space $X$ should have a moment polytope with this property? Motivation: I have another such $X$, that isn't smooth actually, and its nonabelian moment polytope has this property inside the positive Weyl chamber. I would like to know "why". 

Let $H$ be a hyperplane in $\mathbb P^n$, and $X \subseteq H$ be a subscheme. Let $CX \subseteq \mathbb P^n$ be the cone on $X$ from a point $p \notin H$. Let $Hilb_{CX}$ be the Hilbert scheme whose points correspond to subschemes of $\mathbb P^{n}$ with the same Hilbert polynomial as $CX$. Let $U \subseteq Hilb_{CX}$ denote the open set of subschemes transversely intersecting $H$. (So $U \ni CX$.) I'm interested in the subscheme of $U$ consisting of those $Y \subseteq \mathbb P^{n}$ such that $Y \cap H = X$. So, projective schemes with a fixed hyperplane section. 

I think this has a sociological, not mathematical, answer. Whenever you have a structure that could be chosen on a mathematical object, it is handy to have one adjective to say you've made this choice (e.g. oriented) and another to say you could make this choice (e.g. orientable). It's really unfortunate that many, many such structures do not have two distinct adjectives to make clear whether the choice has been made. Your definition is for a quasi-projectived variety (since you say "for a given embedding"), and is perfectly well-defined. In my experience the adjective quasiprojective is used to mean quasi-projectivable (i.e. there exists an embedding), not quasi-projectived. In which case the degree is not well-defined, because it depends on the embedding. 

I'll tell you the proof that's "easy and straightforward" to me, because I like toric varieties, $X$ is toric, and $dH-kE$ is an equivariant line bundle. On a projective toric variety, an ample equivariant line bundle gives you a lattice polytope whose fan is that of the toric variety. For $\mathbb P^3$ the polytope is a tetrahedron, and $\mathcal O(d)$ gets you a tetrahedron with edge-length $d$. For $X$ you snip off one corner, obtaining something with two parallel triangular faces. If $dH-kE$ is ample, the smaller triangle has edge-length $k$, and the distance between the two triangles is $d-k$. You want $k=1$ apparently, i.e. you just barely snip off the corner. If you took $d=1$ the snipped tetrahedron would degenerate to a triangle, and the line bundle would be only nef, not ample; the map to projective space would be the one collapsing $X$ to $\mathbb P^2$. So you need $d\geq 2$ for this to be ample. I don't know where that $5$ comes from. (It's fun to consider $k$ negative, where instead of the corner moving into the tetrahedron and becoming a triangle, it comes out as a sort of negative triangle, and the polytope is the size $d$ tetrahedron plus an extra size $-k$ "negative" tetrahedron. The extra one is telling you something about $H^1$ of this non-ample line bundle.) 

This is fine for $\mathbb Z$-coefficients; you don't need to go to $\mathbb R$. The part of the sequence you need is $$0\to H_{S^1}^0(S^2) \to H_{S^1}^0(U) \oplus H_{S^1}^0(V) \to H_{S^1}^0(U\cap V) \to H_{S^1}^1(S^2) \to H_{S^1}^1(U) \oplus H_{S^1}^1(V) $$ which you worked out to $$ 0\to H_{S^1}^0(S^2) \to {\mathbb Z}^2 \to {\mathbb Z} \to H_{S^1}^1(S^2) \to 0 \oplus 0 $$ so it is enough to notice that the restriction map $H_{S^1}^0(V) \to H_{S^1}^0(U\cap V)$, aka $H^0({\mathbb CP}^{\infty}) \to H^0(pt)$, is onto. Then $H^0_{S^1}(S^2) = \mathbb Z$ and $H^1 = 0$. 

I won't fight hard about "important", but here's a theorem that was definitely combinatorial before it was geometric. Consider the basis of $K(G/P)$ consisting of $K$-classes of structure sheaves of Schubert varieties, $\{[\mathcal O_{X_\lambda}]\}$. Brion proved that the coefficients $c_{\lambda\mu}^\nu$ in the product structure are appropriately positive, or more precisely, nonnegative times $(-1)^{|\lambda|+|\mu|-|\nu|}$. The proof is by a vanishing theorem in sheaf cohomology and does not compute the coefficients. However, shortly before that, Buch gave an actual formula for these coefficients (though only in the case $G/P$ is a Grassmannian), with the minor corollary being that they had this predictable sign. The proof is pretty much completely combinatorial and doesn't explain "why" the sign should be predictable in (to me) as satisfying a way as Brion's does. But it's much more precise, and was earlier. 

$Hom_G(V^*,V) \cong Hom(V^*,V)^G \cong (V\otimes V)^G \cong (Sym^2 V\oplus Alt^2 V)^G$, so the first is nonzero ($V$ is self-dual) iff $V$ possesses a symmetric or alternating invariant form. By Schur's lemma it can have only one of the two. It's not as easy to do in your head, but you can indeed compute the weight multiplicities of $Alt^2 V$ from those of $V$: $m_\nu(Alt^2 V) = {m_{\nu/2}\choose 2} + \sum_{\{\lambda,\mu\}, \lambda\neq \mu} m_\lambda(V) m_\mu(V)$. Now you need to determine whether those multiplicities give a representation with an invariant vector. This is the most annoying part. For each positive root $\beta$, we have a differencing operator "at $\mu$, subtract the value located at $\mu+\beta$", and these commute. Apply all of them and see if the value at the origin is $1$ or $0$. (This is undoing the denominator in the Weyl character formula, just Fourier transformed to deal with weight multiplicities.) If $1$, then $V$ is quaternionic (for $G$ compact); if $0$, then $V$ is real (for $G$ compact, and $V$ assumed self-dual). The latter half of this answer may not be so different from answering your boldface question with "Yes, in principle you must be able to, since the representation is characterized by its multiplicity diagram." 

If $C \subset {[n]\choose k}$ is any collection of $k$-element sets, we can define a scheme $$ W(C) = \bigcap_{S\notin C} \{V \in Gr(k,n) : p_S(V)=0\} \qquad \subseteq Gr(k,n), $$ where $p_S$ is the corresponding Plücker coordinate. Two well-known theorems about this construction are (1) any Schubert variety is of the form $W(C)$ [Hodge-Pedoe], and (2) if $W(C)$ is irreducible then $C$ is a matroid. (The converse does not hold.) (Proof of #2: $C$ is a matroid iff each $\pi\cdot C$ has a unique Bruhat minimum, $\pi\in S_n$. One traces this to the fact that an irreducible variety has a unique open Białynicki-Birula stratum, for the circle $\pi\cdot{\check\rho}$. 

Q1: Sure, you can have embedded components. Project a curve in $P^3$ into a plane. Where the image crosses itself, you get embedded points. You can improve connected to "set-theoretically equidimensional, and connected in codimension 1". I think the real moral should be that you shouldn't keep track just of the scheme structure when you're done degenerating a smooth variety, but of e.g. the induced log structure, and consider a moduli space of varieties + that extra structure. I should probably ask a question about that! 

To define a Nakajima quiver variety associated to a quiver $Q = (Q_0,Q_1)$ (vertices and arrows), one first doubles it to $Q^\heartsuit$ by attaching an extra vertex to every old vertex in $Q_0$. Then a weight space of a representation should arise as the top homology of a moduli space ${\mathcal M}(v,w)$ of representations of $Q^\heartsuit$, where $v$ is the dimension vector on the original vertices and $w$ on the new vertices. (I am following Ginzburg's lectures on this topic.) 

The question isn't quite well-defined: if we blow up $\mathbb A^2$ along $\mathfrak m = \langle x,y\rangle$ or along $\mathfrak m^{k}$ for $k>1$, we get the same space. It's handy that the spaces you're asking about are all toric varieties. So one can compute polyhedrally. Instead of $X = \mathbb A^2$, consider the monoid $\{(p,q)\ :\ p,q\in\mathbb N\}$ (whose monoid algebra has spectrum $X$). To blow it up the first time, chop off the corner, leaving only the elements of $\mathfrak m$, or maybe of $\mathfrak m^k$ (i.e. removing an isosceles right triangle of size $k$). But now you want to blow up again, cutting off one of the two new corners. I'll be a bit sketchy here and just say that to have a complete description, we want the resulting shape to have $2+1+1$ edges (not fewer) and only integer vertices. That suggests that the first cut should give $\mathfrak m^2$, leaving vertices $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$, and the second should leave vertices $(2,0),(1,1),(0,3)$. Which exactly correspond to your suggested generators.
