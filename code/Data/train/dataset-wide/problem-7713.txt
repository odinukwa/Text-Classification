In some sense, the "universal" version of this fact was proved by Blumberg-Gepner-Tabuada as Proposition 3.3 in this paper. That is, they proved the analogue for stable $\infty$-categories, which is the description of the $\infty$-category $Fun^{ex}(A, B)$, the internal hom in the $\infty$-category of idempotent complete stable $\infty$-categories and exact functors, via what they call "right-compact" $A$-$B$-bimodules, which are the analogue of right quasi-representable functors or quasi-functors. In fact, the proof is much nicer in this setting. I claim that any "reasonable" version of Toën's theorem should follow from this version. By that I mean for any $\mathcal{V}$ such that $\mathcal{V}$-categories model some version of stable $\infty$-categories (so that my claim is basically tautological). For example, for spectral categories ($\mathcal{V}$-categories where $\mathcal{V}$ is the symmetric monoidal model category of symmetric spectra), this follows from the equivalence in Theorem 1.10 between idempotent complete stable $\infty$-categories, and spectral categories up to Morita equivalence. For dg-categories, it should follow similarly by using the equivalence between dg-categories and linear stable $\infty$-categories. (Note that the internal hom in the $\infty$-category of dg-categories is the same as the derived internal hom in the model category of dg-categories.) 

Let $\Delta^1_k$ be the $k$-linear dg-category with two objects $0$ and $1$, mapping complexes $$ Map(0,0) = [k], $$ $$ Map(0,1) = [k], $$ $$ Map(1,0) = [0], $$ $$ Map(1,1) = [k] $$ where $[k]$ means the complex with $k$ in degree zero, and a composition law defined in the obvious way. This is a cofibrant dg-category, and one can show that the tensor product $$ \Delta^1_k \otimes \Delta^1_k $$ is not cofibrant. For an argument, see Exercise 3.2.2 in [Bertrand Toën, Lectures on DG-categories, in "Topics in algebraic and topological K-theory", pp. 243-302 (2011)], available here (labelled as Exercise 14 in the latter pdf). 

However, there is a stronger statement: it satisfies descent with respect to the Nisnevich topology (which lies between Zariski and etale). This is due to 

One could say that the story begins with Beilinson's conjectures on the existence of a theory of motivic cohomology. In accordance with the insights of the Grothendieck school that cohomology theories in nature always come with a corresponding "category of coefficients", and that it is very often profitable to work at the categorical level instead of at the level of cohomology groups, Beilinson also conjectured that there should exist triangulated categories $DM(S, \mathbf{Z})$, where the conjectural motivic cohomology groups can be computed as Ext-groups. By a category of coefficients I mean a system of (triangulated) categories, for each scheme $S$, equipped with the formalism of six operations (the objects are thought of as "coefficients" for cohomology). When Voevodsky set out to construct these categories $DM(S,\mathbf{Z})$, he was guided strongly by the principle that motivic cohomology should play the role in algebraic geometry of singular cohomology of smooth manifolds, whose category of coefficients is the derived category of chain complexes of abelian groups. In fact, singular cohomology is only one of many "generalized cohomology theories" on smooth manifolds (other examples include topological K-theory and cobordism), and unlike singular cohomology, most cohomology theories cannot be computed as the cohomology groups of a chain complex, but rather must be defined as the homotopy groups of a space or spectrum. Thus, inspired by the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms, let's define a cohomology theory on smooth manifolds to be a presheaf $\mathcal{F}$ of spaces on the category of smooth manifolds satisfying two conditions. First we require that it is homotopy invariant: we have $H^i(X \times \mathbf{R}, \mathcal{F}) \simeq H^i(X, \mathcal{F})$ for all smooth manifolds $X$, where $H^{-*}(X, \mathcal{F})$ denote the homotopy groups of the space $\mathcal{F}(X)$. Secondly we require the existence of Mayer-Vietoris long exact sequences (or more precisely that $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies a homotopical version of the sheaf condition). Then one can prove that the category of cohomology theories in this sense is equivalent to the homotopy category of spaces (to make precise sense of the "category of cohomology theories" one should use homotopical or higher categorical language). If we take presheaves valued in chain complexes instead, we get a category equivalent to the derived category of abelian groups (= the category of coefficients for singular cohomology). Voevodsky's first construction of DM, which goes back to his 1992 thesis, was directly inspired by the above. Thus the idea was to take presheaves of chain complexes on schemes (over some fixed base $S$), and impose homotopy invariance with respect to the affine line $\mathbf{A}^1$ instead of the real line. An important question is then which Grothendieck topology to take for the sheaf condition. Instead of the Zariski or Nisnevich topologies, Voevodsky used a topology he called the "h-topology", which is essentially what you get when you take the Zariski topology and you add in proper surjections as coverings (the name came from his expectation that this topology seemed to be "suitable for the developing of the homotopy theory of schemes"). With this definition he was able to construct Gysin sequences and prove projective bundle and blow-up formulas in motivic cohomology. Let's come back to the setting of smooth manifolds for a moment. The Dold-Thom theorem says that the (reduced) singular homology groups of a smooth manifold $X$ can be computed as the homotopy groups of the infinite symmetric power $S^\infty(X)$. Inspired by this, Suslin constructed a singular homology theory for schemes by taking an algebraic analogue of infinite symmetric powers. In 1996, Suslin and Voevodsky were able to prove a comparison of Suslin's singular homology construction with étale cohomology with torsion coefficients. After this work, I think Voevodsky realized that what was really important was perhaps not the h-topology itself, but just the fact that h-sheaves automatically admit transfers. Indeed, the existence of Gysin sequences and projective bundle formula only actually require the Nisnevich topology. In view of this he then defined (the effective version of) DM in the form we use today, which is more or less rigged so that hom groups in the category compute Suslin homology (at least over a field). The idea is that instead of using the h-topology, we just use the Nisnevich topology but then force our presheaves to have the additional structure of transfers in a different way: we take presheaves on the category whose objects are smooth $S$-schemes, but whose morphisms are Voevodsky's finite correspondences. Above I have been discussing the effective categories $DM^{eff}(S,\mathbf{Z})$. The non-effective version $DM(S,\mathbf{Z})$ is just obtained by forcing the Tate twist operation $X \mapsto X(1) := X \otimes \mathbf{Z}(1)$ to become invertible. This is analogous to the relationship between the bounded-below derived category $D^+(\mathbf{Z})$ and the unbounded derived category $D(\mathbf{Z})$, where the latter can be thought of as taking $D^+(\mathbf{Z})$ and forcing the suspension functor $[1]$ to become invertible. The main motivation is to be able to express duality phenomena: for example, one can prove that for a smooth proper $S$-scheme $X$ of relative dimension $n$, the dual of the motive $M(X) \in DM(S,\mathbf{Z})$ is given by $M(X)(-n)[-2n]$. For a reference on triangulated categories of motives, I would recommend the book on the subject by Cisinski and Déglise. A shorter reference that could be easier to start with is the paper "Finite correspondences and transfers over a regular base" by Déglise. 

In Elliptic Modular Forms and Their Applications, p.89, Zagier defines a "größencharakter" $\psi_N$ on the field $K = \mathbb{Q}(i)$. This is a character on ideals. Since $\mathcal{O}_K = \mathbb{Z}[i]$ is a PID we can write every integral ideal $I\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$ as $I = (\lambda)$ for a choice of $4$ different generators $\lambda\in\mathcal{O}_K$ (since $w_K = \lvert\mathcal{O}_K^\times\rvert=4$). Specifically, define $$\psi_N (I) = \overline{\lambda}^N, \quad \text{ if } w_K\vert N \text{ and } I = (\lambda),$$ and set it to be $0$ for $N$ not divisible by $w_K$. More generally, assume that $K$ is an imaginary quadratic number field with class number $h_K = 1$, and let $w_K$ denote the size of the unit group $\mathcal{O}_K^\times$. Define $$\psi_N(I)=\overline{\lambda}^N, \quad \text{ if } w_K\vert N \text{ and } I = (\lambda).$$ 

As an example of what I mean by ''simple formula'', I originally thought perhaps $$\Phi(x_1,x_0)=\sum_{w} (-1)^{\text{weight}(w)}\zeta(w)w, \quad \text{weight}(w) := \text{length of } w.$$ However this is not correct, because we know that $\zeta(2)=\zeta(x_0 x_1) = -\zeta(x_1 x_0)$ (using shuffle-regularisation). I expect that some formula would use the path-reversal formula for iterated integrals (because we are now integrating along $\text{dch}^{-1}$) and perhaps the change of variables $z\mapsto 1-z$ on $X$. 

Let $X$ be a complex elliptic curve and $e$ the identity element of $X$. Let $E^\times$ denote the punctured curve $X\backslash\left\{e\right\}$. In their 2007 paper Towards Multiple Elliptic Polylogarithms, Levin and Racinet compute the de Rham fundamental group $\pi_1 ^{dR} (E^\times, e)$. To do this they prove that there is an equivalence of categories (Theorem 1) $$R\mathsf{-NMod}\xrightarrow{\sim} \mathsf{NConn}(X;e)$$ where: 

$$\Delta(\mathbf{t}) = \mathbf{t}\otimes 1 + 1\otimes\mathbf{t},\quad \Delta(A) = A\otimes 1 + 1\otimes A;$$ 

By definition the de Rham fundamental group $\pi_1^{dR} (E^\times;b)$ is the Tannakian fundamental group of the category $\mathsf{Un}(X;e)$, with fiber functor $\omega$ sending a bundle to the stalk over a basepoint $b$ of $X$ (or for $e$, a suitable notion of "tangential basepoint"). By the above equivalence, it follows that there is an isomorphism between $\pi_1^{dR} (E^\times;e)$ and the Tannakian fundamental group of $R-\mathsf{NMod}$ (with the forgetful functor as fiber functor). In Corollary 2.2.7, Levin and Racinet claim that this Tannakian fundamental group is $$\pi_1^{dR} (E^\times; e)\cong \exp \mathbb{L}(\mathbf{t}, A).$$ I don't understand how this is calculated as the Tannakian fundamental group of $R-\mathsf{NMod}$. Would anyone be able to help me or point to how this is calculated? Many thanks! 

Then the proof is as follows. Let $j : U \hookrightarrow X$ be an open immersion and $p : Y \to X$ an etale morphism defining an elementary Nisnevich square $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} W @>>> Y \\ @VVV @VV{p}V \\ U @>>{j}> X \end{CD}$$ We want to show that the square $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} K(X) @>{j^*}>> K(U) \\ @V{p^*}VV @VVV \\ K(Y) @>>> K(W) \end{CD}$$ is a homotopy cartesian square of connective spectra. (In the noetherian case, Morel-Voevodsky showed that Nisnevich descent is equivalent to this Brown-Gersten-style excision property; in the non-noetherian case, this should really be taken as the "correct" definition of the Nisnevich topology.) For this it is sufficient to show that there is an equivalence on homotopy fibres. 2) and 3) imply that the homotopy fibres are given by $K_{X-U}(X)$ and $K_{Y-W}(Y)$, respectively. Then the equivalence follows from the fact that there is already an equivalence $$ Perf_{X-U}(X) \stackrel{\sim}{\longrightarrow} Perf_{Y-W}(Y) $$ at the level of perfect complexes, by 1). This proof works for quasi-compact quasi-separated schemes. By the way, the same proof works for (qcqs) derived schemes. By far the most non-trivial part of the proof is 2), which was established in [B. Toen, Derived Azumaya algebras and generators for twisted derived categories, arXiv:1002.2599]. A proof of 1), attributed to Drinfeld, is given in [D. Gaitsgory, Notes on geometric Langlands: Quasi-coherent sheaves on stacks, pdf]. In fact, this probably even gives a proof for the spectral schemes of Lurie, modulo a key point in the proof of 2) which I do not know how to do in the setting of $E_\infty$-ring spectra (but this is probably just my ignorance). 

The argument sketched in Example 3.20 of [J. P. Pridham, Tannaka duality for enhanced triangulated categories, arXiv:1309.0637] demonstrates the comparison assuming the existence of the motivic t-structure. On the other hand, an unconditional proof is given in [Utsav Choudhury, Martin Gallauer Alves de Souza, An isomorphism of motivic Galois groups, arXiv:1410.6104]. 

It is hard to know where to begin! A general principle is that as long as you are only concerned with the derived category of a single variety, it is generally sufficient to consider it as a triangulated category; while as soon as you are interested in families of derived categories, it becomes impossible to stay in the triangulated setting, so that it becomes necessary to pass to some homotopical refinement. The basic reason for this is the extremely poor behaviour of the homotopy theory of triangulated categories. The most striking example is the work of Orlov on Fourier-Mukai functors. A triangulated functor between derived categories of schemes is called of Fourier-Mukai type if it of geometric origin, i.e. if it is given by twisting by a complex on the product of the schemes. Orlov showed in the 90's that for smooth projective varieties over a field, any fully faithful functor between derived categories of coherent sheaves is of Fourier-Mukai type. It was expected, or hoped, that every functor is Fourier-Mukai, but this turned out to be impossible to prove in the setting of triangulated categories, literally: a counter-example was finally found last year by Van den Bergh and Rizzardo (arXiv:1410.4039), while the dg-categorical analogue was proved ten years ago by Bertrand To\"en (arXiv:0408337). A brief glance at the latter paper will be enough to convince oneself that the proof relies heavily on studying the homotopy theory of dg-categories. A second important application is algebraic K-theory. At the triangulated level, the only part of the algebraic K-theory of $X$ that can be defined from only the triangulated structure is the Grothendieck group. However, it has been believed that the algebraic K-theory of a scheme can be recovered from its derived category for a long time (in the sense that, if two schemes have triangulated-equivalent derived categories, then their higher K-theory groups are isomorphic). Neeman spent many years working on this problem, and I believe that in the end, his work implies that this is true under some assumptions like regularity. However, the proof takes up eight papers of around one hundred pages each. On the other hand, after work of Schlichting, To\"en and others, it is possible to define the algebraic K-theory of a dg-category in such a way that it recovers Thomason-Trobaugh K-theory for the dg-derived category of a scheme. In fact, one can deduce from this the analogous result for triangulated categories: using the theory of Fourier-Mukai functors mentioned above, it is possible to prove that the derived categories of two schemes (quasi-compact, separated over a field, if I recall correctly) are triangulated-equivalent iff their dg-derived categories are quasi-equivalent. Related to this is the question of descent. As bananastack mentioned, the derived category satisfies Zariski descent only at the dg-level. In fact, at the dg-level it even satisfies Nisnevich descent. I believe the latter fact is due independently to Bhatt, Drinfeld and Lurie. From this it is possible to deduce a nice proof of the theorem of Thomason-Trobaugh on Nisnevich descent for K-theory. The missing ingredient is the localization fibre sequence, which can be deduced from compact generation properties of the derived category, which can in turn be proved in an elegant way at the dg-level, as explained in the beautiful paper arXiv:1002.2599 of To\"en. Finally, let me note that, even though the various dg-enhancements constructed in the literature seem rather complicated, the dg-categorical derived category is in fact a more natural object than the triangulated one, in the following sense. The reason one considers the derived category of $X$ in the first place is in order to talk about "homotopy theory of chain complexes of coherent sheaves on $X$, up to quasi-isomorphism". The naive way to make this precise is to take the Gabriel-Zisman localization of the category of chain complexes at the class of quasi-isomorphisms, and then manually identify the distinguished triangles. The smart way is to take the Dwyer-Kan simplicial localization instead, which is a homotopically correct version of Gabriel-Zisman localization which doesn't kill higher homotopies; more precisely, it is a simplicially enriched category whose simplicial Hom-sets have $\pi_0$ identified with the Hom-sets of the Gabriel-Zisman localization. This gives rise to a dg-enhancement where the distinguished triangles are already built in as the (co)fibre sequences. 

The Drinfeld associator $\Phi(x_0, x_1)$ encodes the parallel transport of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) connection $\nabla$ on the bundle $\mathbb{C}\langle\langle x_0, x_1\rangle\rangle$ of formal power series in noncommutating variables $x_0, x_1$ over $X:=\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C})\backslash\left\{0,1,\infty\right\}$. Writing $$\omega_0=\frac{dz}{z}, \quad \omega_1 = \frac{dz}{1-z},$$ we can express the KZ connection as $$\nabla = d-\omega_{KZ}$$ where $\omega_{KZ}\in\Omega^1(X)\otimes\mathbb{C}\langle x_0, x_1\rangle$ is the ''connection form'' $$\omega_{KZ} = x_0\omega_0 + x_1\omega_1.$$ The Drinfeld associator $\Phi(x_0,x_1)\in\mathbb{C}\langle\langle x_0, x_1\rangle\rangle$ (sometimes called KZ associator) is the result of analytically continuing a global horizontal section of $\nabla$ taking the asymptotic value $1$ at $z=0$ along the ''straight line path'' $\text{dch}(t)=t$, $0 < t < 1$. In other words, it is the parallel transport along $\text{dch}$. It can be expressed using iterated integrals as $$\Phi(x_0,x_1) = 1 + \int_{\text{dch}}\omega_{KZ} + \int_{\text{dch}}\omega_{KZ}\omega_{KZ}+\dots$$ It is well-known (e.g. see Lemma 4.2 of Brown's Iterated integrals in quantum field theory) that the coefficients of the Drinfeld associator are multiple zeta values (MZVs). Specifically, we can write $$\Phi(x_0,x_1) = \sum_{w \text{ word in } x_0, x_1}\zeta(w)w$$ where $\zeta(w)$ is the ''shuffle-regularised'' MZV such that $$\zeta(x_0^{k_1-1}x_1\dots x_0^{k_n-1}x_1) = \zeta(k_1, \dots,k_n), \quad \zeta(x_0) = \zeta(x_1)=0.$$ (This depends on your conventions for writing iterated integrals etc.) The inverse of the Drinfeld associator (as power series in noncommuting variables) is $$\Phi(x_1,x_0) = \Phi(x_0,x_1)^{-1}.$$ I take this to mean $$\Phi(x_1,x_0) = \sum_{w \text{ word in } x_0, x_1}\zeta(\overline{w})w$$ where $\overline{w}$ denotes $w$ with $x_0$ and $x_1$ swapped, and the zeta value requires shuffle-regularising. 

This isn't a complete answer, but it is too long for a comment. Here are a couple of ideas relating to your first two questions that I hope you (or anyone else learning this area!) may find useful. Throughout, to better fit your notation, I will assume that $k$ is perfect. Firstly, an etale path on $\bar{X}$ ought to mean exactly the same thing as on any scheme: an isomorphism between two fibre functors $\mathsf{FEt}_{\bar{X}}\to \mathsf{FSet}$ (denoting the categories of finite etale covers of $\bar X$ and of finite sets respectively). Quite generally, given any morphism of schemes $f: Y\to Z$, base change by $f$ gives a functor $B = B_f: \mathsf{FEt}_Z\to\mathsf{FEt}_Y$. Given two fibre functors $F_1, F_2$ on $\mathsf{FEt}_Y$ we can compose these with $B$ like this: $$\mathsf{FEt}_Z\xrightarrow{B}\mathsf{FEt}_Y\rightrightarrows\mathsf{FSet}.$$ An isomorphism between $F_1$ and $F_2$ can be sent to an isomorphism of the composite functors. So any etale path $\gamma: F_1\to F_2$ on $Y$ maps to an etale path $f(\gamma): F_1 \circ B\to F_2\circ B$ on $Z$. Thus etale paths on $\bar{X}$ map to etale paths on $X$ under the morphism $\bar{X}\to X$. I have also struggled recently understanding why "conjugation by an etale path $\gamma$" (on $X$, but take the image of a path on $\bar X$ if you want) should be compatible with the projection $pr_*: \pi_1 (X, \bar{x})\to \Gamma:=\text{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$. Fortunately there seems to be a way to get around this. Let me denote the isomorphism $\gamma (-)\gamma^{-1}:\pi_1 (x,\bar{a})\to\pi_1 (X,\bar{x})$ by $c_\gamma$. The two composite fibre functors $$F_{\bar{a}}\circ B, F_{\bar{x}}\circ B:\mathsf{FEt}_{\text{Spec}(k)}\to\mathsf{FEt}_X\to\mathsf{FSet}$$ are both isomorphic to $F_{\bar{y}}$, where $\bar{y}:\text{Spec}(\bar{k})\to\text{Spec}(k)$ is a geometric point corresponding to the choice of fixed separable ($=$ algebraic) closure. As above, hitting these composite functors with the natural transformation $\gamma$ gives us an etale path on $\text{Spec}(k)$, $$\alpha = pr (\gamma): F_{\bar{y}}\xrightarrow{\sim}F_{\bar{y}},$$ which has the same start and endpoints i.e. an element of its fundamental group $\Gamma$. Geometrically what was once a "path" on $X$ has mapped down to a "loop" on $\text{Spec}(k)$ under $pr$. This loop induces an isomorphism $c_\alpha: \Gamma\xrightarrow{\sim}\Gamma$ via conjugation. We then have a diagram of the form $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} \pi_1 (X,\bar{a}) @>{c_\gamma}>> \pi_1 (X,\bar{x})\\ @V{pr_{*,a}}VV @VV{pr_{*,x}}V\\ \Gamma @>>{c_\alpha}> \Gamma \end{CD}.$$ (Note the vertical maps are dependent on the basepoints - the rightmost vertical map is $pr_*$ in your question.) We know $s_a$ is a section of the left vertical map. Define $$\sigma_a = c_\gamma \circ s_a \circ c_\alpha^{-1}$$ This $\sigma_a$ is then a section of the right vertical map. Hence the rational point $a\in X(k)$ does indeed induce a section $\sigma_a : \Gamma\to\pi_1 (X,\bar{x})$ of the projection map $pr_*$ that is compatible with this difference of basepoints. 

I propose the following plan, assuming a basic background in scheme theory and algebraic topology. I assume that you are interested in derived algebraic geometry from the point of view of applications in algebraic geometry. (If you are interested in applications to topology, you should replace part 2) of the plan by Lurie's Higher algebra.) The plan is based on what worked best for myself, and it's certainly possible that you may prefer to jump into Higher Topos Theory as Yonatan suggested. 0) First of all, make sure you have a solid grounding in basic category theory. For this, read the first two chapters of the excellent lecture notes of Schapira. I would strongly recommend reading chapters 3 and 4 as well, but these can be skipped for now. Then read chapters I and II of Gabriel-Zisman, Calculus of fractions and homotopy theory, to learn about the theory of localization of categories. 1) The next step is to learn the basics of abstract homotopy theory. I recommend working through Cisinski's notes. This will take you through simplicial sets, model categories, a beautiful construction of the Quillen and Joyal model structures (which present $\infty$-groupoids and $\infty$-categories, respectively), and the fundamental constructions of $\infty$-category theory (functor categories, homotopy (co)limits, fibred categories, prestacks, etc.). Supplement the section "Catégories de modèles" with chapter I of Quillen's lecture notes Homotopical algebra. Then read about stable $\infty$-categories and symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories in these notes from a mini-course by Cisinski. (By the way, these ones are in English and also summarize very briefly some of the material from the longer course notes). These notes are very brief, so you will have to supplement them with the notes of Joyal. It may also be helpful to have a look at the first chapter of Lurie's Higher algebra and the notes of Moritz Groth. 2) At this point you are ready to learn some derived commutative algebra: Read lecture 4 of part II of Moerdijk-Toen, Simplicial Methods for Operads and Algebraic Geometry together with section 3 of Lurie's thesis. Supplement this with section 2.2.2 of Toen-Vezzosi's HAG II, referring to chapter 1.2 when necessary. This material is at the heart of derived algebraic geometry: the cotangent complex, infinitesimal extensions, Postnikov towers of simplicial commutative rings, etc. Other helpful things to look at are Schwede's Diplomarbeit and Quillen's Homology of commutative rings. 3) Before learning about derived stacks, I would strongly recommend working through these notes of Toen about classical algebraic stacks, from a homotopy theoretic perspective. There are also these notes of Preygel. This will make it a lot easier to understand what comes next. Then, read Lurie's On $\infty$-topoi. It will be helpful to consult sections 15-20 of Cisinski's Bourbaki talk, section 40 of Joyal's notes on quasi-categories, and Rezk's notes. For a summary of this material, see lecture 2 of Moerdijk-Toen. 4) Finally, read about derived stacks in lecture 5 of Moerdijk-Toen and section 5 of Lurie's thesis. Again, chapters 1.3, 1.4, and 2.2 of HAG II will be very helpful references. See also Gaitsgory's notes (he works with commutative connective dg-algebras instead of simplicial commutative rings, but this makes little difference). His notes on quasi-coherent sheaves in DAG are also very good. 5) At this point, you know the definitions of objects in derived algebraic geometry. To get some experience working with them, I would recommend reading some of the following papers: 

A größencharakter $\chi$ has 2 equivalent formulations (I believe): either as a continuous character on the idele group $\chi: \mathbb{A}_K^\times\to\mathbb{C}^\times$ with $K^\times$ in its kernel, or (modulo some ideal $\mathfrak{m}\subseteq \mathcal{O}_K$) as a character defined on the group $J^\mathfrak{m}$ of ideals coprime to $\mathfrak{m}$ such that there exist characters $$\chi_f: (\mathcal{O}_K/\mathfrak{m})^\times\to\mathbb{C}^\times, \quad \chi_\infty:\mathbf{R}^\times\to\mathbb{C}^\times$$ which determine $\chi$ on principal integral ideals: $\chi((a)) = \chi_f(a)\chi_\infty(a)$ when $a\in\mathcal{O}_K$ is coprime to $\mathfrak{m}$. Here, $\mathbf{R}$ is the $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $$\mathbf{R} = \left\{(z,\overline{z}): z\in\mathbb{C}\right\}$$ and $K\hookrightarrow\mathbf{R}$ via $a\mapsto (a, \overline{a})$. (This definition of a größencharakter can be found, for example, in Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory, p.470.) Ideally I would like to see how either of these could be written down explicitly for this "größencharakter" $\psi_N$, and to understand how to extend this ad-hoc definition to a größencharakter in either sense. 

I don't really understand why this is. The picture in my head is that a point of $\mathcal{E}'$ is (roughly) a nonzero point $x$ on some elliptic curve $E$. Therefore constant maps $\mathbb{C}\to \mathcal{E}'$ correspond to pairs $[E,x]$ as above. But I don't understand why other possibly nonconstant maps $\mathbb{C}\to\mathcal{E}'$ should also correspond to such a pair $[E,x]$. Or are all such maps constant? 

Nice question! I believe the following provides a proof that hom-incomparability is a sufficient condition for the product to be a core. Let $G$ and $H$ be hom-incomparable cores and let $f$ be an endomorphism of the product $G\times H$. Then $f$ cannot "mix" the two factors. Formally, $f$ cannot be of the form $f=(\varphi,\psi)$ where $\varphi: G\rightarrow G$ and $\psi:G\rightarrow H$ (or any of the other obvious ways to mix the morphisms up) since $G$ and $H$ are hom-incomparable. Thus $f$ must preserve adjacency "pointwise" in the sense that $f=(f_G, f_H)$ where $f_G :G\rightarrow G$ and $f_H :H\rightarrow H$ are morphisms of the factor cores. Since $G$ and $H$ are cores, both of these morphisms are automorphisms. Hence $f$ is an automorphism of $G\times H$ with inverse $f^{-1} = (f_G^{-1}, f_H^{-1})$, so $G\times H$ is a core.
