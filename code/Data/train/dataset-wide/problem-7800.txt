No, it is not unique. To obtain the general solution, set $g(t)=\log f(e^t)$. Then your equation is equivalent to $g(t+\log 2)=g(t)+\log\alpha$. One solution is an affine function, but any periodic function can be added to it. So there are infinitely many solutions and continuity and monotonicity do not help. 

There is no closed form except for the cases $a=0,1$. But you can find the asymptotic behavior. See, for example Fatou, Sur les equations fonctionnelles, Bull Soc. Math. France, 47 (1919), section 8 and further. Available here: $URL$ BSMF_1919_47/BSMF_1919_47_161_0/BSMF_1919_47_161_0.pdf 

Let $\phi$ be the conformal map of the unit disk onto the interior. The only thing that can be said about $\phi$ is that it is analytic and univalent in the closed disk. If your entire function $f$ exists, then $B=f\circ\phi$ is a finite Blaschke product (by symmetry principle). So $\phi=f^{-1}\circ B$. It is clear that not every univalent function analytic in the closed disk has such representation with entire $f$. For example, Iversen's theorem shows that $f^{-1}\circ B$ cannot have a singular arc. EDIT. If you want a more elementary argument, take any polynomial (univalent in the unit disk, and other than a monomial) as $\phi$. Then $f\circ\phi=B$, a Blaschke product. It follows that $f$ itself is a polynomial, and thus $B(z)=z^n$. But then $\phi$ must be also a monomial, and this contradicts our assumption about $\phi$. 

Let $f(x)={\mathrm{erf}}(x)-\tanh(x)$. It can be easily seen from Taylor series at $0$ and from asymptotics at $\infty$ that $f(x)>0$ for small $x$ and for large $x$. Let us prove that $f(x)>0$ by contradiction. Suppose that $f(x)$ is negative for some $x$, then $f'$ must have at least $3$ positive zeros, by Rolle's theorem. This means that the equation $$g(x):=e^{-x^2}(e^{2x}+2+e^{-2x})=2\sqrt{\pi}$$ has at least $3$ positive solutions. But this is not the case because the LHS is monotone. Indeed, differentiating $g$, dividing by $e^{-x^2}$ and replacing $2x$ with $y$ we obtain $$g'(x)=\sinh(y)-y\cosh(y)-y<0,$$ because $\sinh(y) < y \cosh(y)$ as you can see from their Taylor series. 

$F(f)$ is analytic and tends to $0$ faster than any power because $f$ is $C_0^\infty$. $F$ and $F^{-1}$ map $L^2$ onto itself. So the question is when $|x|^{-2a}$ belongs to $L^2$ locally (near the origin). Normally this happens when $a<n/4$. This is necessary and sufficient unless $Ff(0)$ accidentally equals to $0$. Edit. Can we relax the condition $f\in C_0^\infty$ ? Yes, we can. Compact support was not really used much. Fast enough decrease will be enough. On the other hand, smoothness was used substantially, to ensure that the behavior at infinity is good for every $a$.

Linear periodic problems are solved with Fourier series. I comment on the first part only. $f$ is periodic, suppose wlog that $T=2\pi$, and expand it into Fourier series $$f(x)=\sum a_ne^{inx}.$$ Let $L$ be the differential operator in the left hand side. I suppose that the coefficients are constant (from your answer to my question in your previous post). Moreover, I assume that the differential operator is of finite order. Solution $s(x)$ is a superposition (linear combination) of solutions to $$(1)\quad\quad (Ls)(x)=e^{inx}.$$ If the characteristic equation of $L$ has no integer roots, then this always has a solution of the form $s_n(x)=c_ne^{inx}$, where $c_n$ is found by substitution of this form of $s_n$ to the equation. In this case we obtain all $c_n$ and the periodic solution $$s(x)=\sum_{n} c_ne^{inx}.$$ To this you can add a solution of the homogeneous equation. This solution of the homogeneous equation may be periodic or not, and with arbitrary period depending on the coefficients of $L$. It may happen (rarely) that some $n$ is a zero of the characteristic equation. Then solution of (1) has the form $c_n P(x)e^{ikx}$, which is not periodic, and there cannot be a periodic solution unless we take $c_n=0$. As you differential operator is of finite order, we come to the following conclusion: if for some $n$, $a_n\neq 0$ and this $n$ is not a root of the characteristic equation, then we have a solution with period (at most) $T$. If for all $n$ either $a_n=0$ of $n$ is a root of the characteristic equation, then there is no periodic solution (a resonance case). For example $s^{\prime\prime}=1$ has no periodic solution, though the right hand side is periodic. But this is because $n=0$ is the only root of the characteristic equation. So I suppose that "Numerical phenomenon 2" can be explained as follows: some number $k/m$ happens to be a root of the characteristic equation, and other roots are not resonant with the right hand side. This adds to the solution a harmonic of the form $\exp(ikx/m)$ of period $2\pi m$. But in this case, the periodic solution is not unique, and there is always some with period $T$. 

An example which has infinitely many is $e^z$ with $g_n(z)=z^n$ and $h(z)=e^{z/n}$. This was unsolved when I was a student in 1970-th, and I suppose still is. EDIT. Another question of this sort from the theory of entire functions was this (Erdos). Consider a family $A$ of entire functions with the property that for every $z\in C$, the set $\{ f(z):f\in A\}$ is at most countable. Does it follow that $A$ is at most countable? But this question has been "solved": it turns out that the answer depends on the Continuum Hypothesis:-) 

As noticed in the previous remark, it is not true that every $f$ can be represented by a power series, $\sum c_kx^k$ because the sum of this series must be analytic. Same applies to the intergal $\int x^r d\mu(r)$. This function is analytic on intervals $I$ that do not contain zero. However, there is an analog of Weierstrass theorem for non-integer powers $x^{r_k}, r_k>0$. This is called the Muntz-Sasz theorem. It says roughly speaking that the span of these monomials is dense in C[a,b], 0 < a < b, if and only if the series $\sum 1/r_k$ diverges. 

Yes, of course, after we shrink $U$. A convergent Taylor series at a real point converges in some complex neighborhood of this point. Added reply to your comment: you can apply identity theorem. Two real analytic functions coinciding on an open set of $R^n$ coincide in a complex neighborhood of this set. 

Here is a simple proof for complex-analytic case. If restrictions of $f$ on all complex lines are analytic, then $f$ is analytic. This reduces the problem to the case $n=1$. Now $f^2$ is analytic so near every point, so it has a representation $f^2(z)=(z-a)^mg(z),$ where $g(a)\neq 0$. If $m$ is even, we obtain analyticity of $f$. If $m$ is odd, $f$ cannot be $C^\infty$; some derivative blows up. The argument also works for real-analytic, as a real-analytic function extends to complex analytic in some complex neighborhood. EDIT. This proof extends to quasianalytic functions of $DC$ (Denjoy-Carleman) class. One needs two facts: 

To my understanding, the reason is simple: in the almost 300 years since $e$ was discovered, no representation of it as a period has been found. I think this is quite a strong evidence. 

The number of bound states is indeed finite. This can be proved as follows. First of all, for a bound state your eigenvalue $-k^2$ must be real. This is because your operator with real $u$ and zero boundary conditions at $\pm\infty$ is self-adjoint. Next, if real $\kappa^2$ is very large by absolute value, then you cannot have a bound state: if $\kappa^2$ is very negative, $\psi$ oscillates at $\infty$, if $\kappa^2$ is very positive, $\phi$ cannot be zero on both infinities by the Sturm comparison theorem. It remains to notice that your function $\beta(\kappa)$ is analytic, so it cannot have infinitely many zeros on a finite interval. 

Let $U$ be the unit disc, and $f$ a univalent (=injective) holomorphic function, $f(0)=0$, $f'(0)>0$. There is a one-to-one correspondence between such functions and simply connected regions $D$ in the plane, containing $0$. The function is real iff $D$ is symmetric with respect to the real line.

Some important applications of Teichmuller theory are to 3-D topology (I mean the work of Thurston, and later development of this work), and to holomorphic dynamics. On this I refer on the books by Thurston and by Hubbard, and on the paper of Douady and Hubbard A proof of Thurston's topological characterization of rational functions, MR1251582, but this was already mentioned in the original question. Actually, since the work of Sullivan, Douady and Hubbard, Teichmuller theory is one of the main tools in holomorphic dynamics. There are also applications to string theory, and I expect that some string theorist will write about them. But here is a nice example, where string theorists made a pure mathematical conjecture, and it was proved using Teichmuller theory: MR0882831 Zograf, P. G.; Takhtajan, L. A. On the Liouville equation, accessory parameters and the geometry of Teichmüller space for Riemann surfaces of genus 0.
