There seems to exist a rarely-stated assumption that somehow corporations are an essential element of a free-market economy, and that they benefit a nation's economy. However, I wonder if this is really true. Here, I am speaking of the US form of a corporation which allows a small number of people to control capital contributed by a large number and also allows those same people to disavow responsibility for the debts and liabilities of the corporation. In the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith deprecated any kind of joint stock companies, writing that a man would be much more careless with other people's money than his own. By this logic one might see corporate law as a way for elites to exploit society parasitically and corporate law as a damage to the economy instead of a benefit. Is there any theoretical validity to this kind of view? 

I have read that Apple Computer issues corporate bonds. Considering that it has $200 billion in cash, and the company complains it has been unable to spend its enormous amount of cash, why would they be issuing corporate bonds? 

Because they have low interest rates and growing tax revenue. As long as your income is growing faster than your debt, you can keep borrowing. 

In some cases I see otherwise stable stocks or commodities having wild swings in price on exchanges. Even though the underlying company or commodity is going along normally and there is no news that the item is anything but stable, traders might be wildly buying or selling causing the market price to fluctuate. This seems to happen more often when an item or stock is the subject of public interest, so there might be an element of "mob psychology" involved. Are there any standardized models that have attempted to capture the psychological elements of trading? 

In practice all governments make local decisions to modify the exchange rates, for instance to help import/exports they can slightly provide supply/demand so that the rate is modified. 

Note that if you produce stuff you need to store it somewhere, which comes at a cost. This is explicitly included in the EPQ model via the holding cost variable 

Linear regression, despite its simplicity, it is actually a very powerful tool. That's why it's everywhere in econometrics, to give you an example you're maybe familiar with, consider an auto-regressive model, turns out you can write the future state of a variable that follows this model as a linear combination of previous states $$ X_t = C + \phi_1 X_{t-1} + \phi_2 X_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_p X_{t-p} + \eta_t \tag{1} $$ so, if you know the weights $\{\phi_k \}_{k=1}^p$ you can predict what's going to be the future values of $X$. The interesting part is that these numbers are obtained through linear regression: just call $y = X_t$, $x_1 = X_{t-1}, x_2 = X_{t-2},\cdots$ and realize Eq. (1) can be written as $$ y = C + \phi_1 x_1 + \phi_2 x_2 + \cdots + \phi_p x_p + \epsilon \tag{2} $$ In this sense linear regression can be used for forecasting. But there are other tools, I will link you to this other thread where you can get an idea on how neuronal networks can be used for this task: forecasting time series. But forecasting can also be done with a plethora of methods: support vector machines are popular choices. 

In contrast with the previous system, the exchange is artificially maintained fixed by the government. The way they do it is pegging the local currency to a foreign currency (say USD) and compensate the supply/demand in order to keep the exchange fixed. A good example of this system was the Chinese Yuan, when the local demand of USD increased, the government had to release US Dollar into the market in order to mitigate the fluctuation In the curve bellow I show the exchange CHY/USD, you can immediately see that in the period 1998-2005 (for instance) the Yuan was pegged to the Dollar 

You have some incorrect ideas about wealth. First of all, inheriting money does not concentrate wealth, it disperses it. Usually the recipients of inheritances, both organizations and wayward children spend the money the receive so the inheritance is dispersed completely. Most people who are wealthy got that way not by earning a lot of money, but by saving the money they did earn. How much a person saves and invests is a much bigger indicator of wealth than income. A plumber that saves and invests will eventually become much richer than a doctor who spends all his money. Also, most people who wealthy are not manufacturers who "make a great product," they are ordinary professionals and businessmen: doctors, lawyers, business executives, electricians, plumbers, and builders. You can even find many blue collar workers who have become rich by saving and investing: policeman, firemen, teachers. Where I live there are two teachers, a husband and wife couple, who started out as ordinary high school teachers and now they are quite wealthy and own their own private school. There are probably more millionaire garbage men, than there are millionaire manufacturers. Owning a bunch of garbage trucks is enough to make you a millionaire. Now think how many garbage trucks there are. Here is an article about typical characteristics of wealthy people: $URL$ 

National currencies increase or decrease in price relative to other national currencies due to the demand for those currencies and their supply. The supply and demand for currency is dependent on many different factors. The main factors are the needs of trade, the policies of the authority that issues the currency, and the perceived stability and predictability of that authority. For example, if a merchant wants to buy a good that comes from the country in question, then they might need to acquire the currency of the country. This will increase the demand for the currency and consequently its price. On the other hand, if the country had a revolution or the authority that issues the currency began to act in an erratic way, then that could undermine confidence in the currency, decreasing the demand and the price. 

I have used gambit (python) in the past and could recommend it. It also includes a small GUI which makes things very intuitive. R also has GameTheory if you prefer this platform instead 

In this system the rate is fixed by supply/demand. Roughly speaking: a currency is worth whatever buyers are willing to pay for it. So, for example if (for some reason) many people in US are buying Euro (EU) then the demand increases, and so will the price, the rate USD/EU will drop and you will get fewer Euro for each US Dollar. Conversely, for Europeans the Dollar will depreciate as more USD were supplied to the market. Usually countries with very mature/estable currencies have these systems (e.g. Canada, Switzerland, United States), allowing the exchange rate to adjust itself to local conditions (inflation, supply, demand, $\dots$). Although this may sound great, it actually has its drawbacks, for instance, lack of certainty may refrain some investors. One may argue that the fact that the economy is stable in these countries, then we're indeed certain of what's going to happen before an investment, but I guess that's a whole other story. Below there's a graph of the evolution of the exchange rate for the Swiss Franc to USD 

I guess you already went trough the algebra below, but just for context, the problem you're trying to solve is $$ \max_{c}\sum_{t=0}^{+\infty}\beta^t u(c_t) \\ \text{s.t.}~~ f(k_t) + (1- \delta)k_t = c_t + k_{t+1} \tag{1} $$ where $f(k_t) = k_t^\alpha$ and $$ u(c_t) = \frac{c_t^{1-\gamma}}{1-\gamma} - 1 \tag{2} $$ The problem in (1) can be cast into the two coupled equations \begin{eqnarray} u'(c_t) &=& \beta[1 + f'(k_{t+1}) - \delta]u'(c_{t+1}) \\ k_{t+1} &=& f(k_t) + (1-\delta)k_t - c_t \tag{3} \end{eqnarray} where $u'(x) = x^{-\gamma}$, and $f'(x) = \alpha x^{\alpha-1}$. These first of Eqns. (3) can be inverted to obtain an expression for $c_{t+1}$ in terms of $(k_t,c_t)$, leading to \begin{eqnarray} c_{t+1} &=& \beta^{1/\gamma}c_t [1 + \alpha[k_t^\alpha + (1-\delta)k_t - c_t]^{\alpha-1} - \delta]^{1/\gamma} \\ k_{t+1} &=& f(k_t) + (1-\delta)k_t - c_t \tag{4} \end{eqnarray} Which can be expressed as $$ {\bf x}_{t+1} = {\bf F}({\bf x}_{t})~~~\mbox{with}~~~ {\bf x}_t = \left(\begin{array}{c}c_{t}\\k_{t}\end{array}\right) \tag{5} $$ A fixed point ${\bf x}^*$ of the map ${\bf F}$ is such that $$ {\bf x}^* = {\bf F}({\bf x}^*) \tag{6} $$ that is, a point for which the system does not evolve. If you use $\gamma=2$, $\beta=0.9964$, $\alpha=0.36$, $\delta=0.025$ this point is (found by solving Eq. (6)), $$ {\bf x}^* = \left(\begin{array}{c}c^*\\k^*\end{array}\right) = \left(\begin{array}{c}2.84829\\52.2808\end{array}\right) \tag{7} $$ which is clearly different from zero! You can linearize ${\bf F}$ around ${\bf x}^*$ and write the result as $$ {\bf y}_{t+1} = {\bf J}{\bf y}_t ~~~\mbox{where}~~~ {\bf y}_t = {\bf x}_{t} - {\bf x}^*, ~~~ {\bf J} = \left.\frac{\partial{\bf J}}{\partial {\bf x}}\right|_{{\bf x} = {\bf x}^*} \tag{8} $$ Is this last system the one that has a saddle point at ${\bf y} = 0$ 

The newest trend in global finance is elite monetization, meaning monetization of all elite assets such as top corporations and municipalities. Central banks are buying the stocks and bonds of elite corporations. For example, in Japan a significant fraction of all the top companies (Sumitomo, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Toyota, etc) is owned by the Bank of Japan. The US Fed just threatened to buy "other asset classes", presumably meaning corporate bonds. To some extent the purchases are monetized, ie bought with newly created money, and to some extent they are made by borrowing from the public at negative interest rates. In other words the Japanese people are paying the Bank of Japan for the privilege of loaning them money to buy stocks and bonds. Of course, one could argue that they are not "buying" anything since it is printed or borrowed money, so you could argue it is a seizure of equity, not a genuine purchase. The logical question is what is the end of this? Can all the governments of the world, just "buy" all the corporations of the world? What is the terminus ad infinitum? 

Back in the 1980s leveraged buyouts were a common event. Financiers like T. Boone Pickens would borrow money, buy a controlling interest in a publicly traded stock and then re-engineer the company, for example, by selling it off in pieces. This activity seems to be a thing of the past. I assume some law was passed to prevent leveraged buyouts. What was the cause of the demise of leveraged buyouts? 

As I understand it, some portion of the Greek sovereign debt has been converted into "Euro swaps". Can someone explain in simple terms what that means? What debt was given to whom? 

Turkey has 80 million people yet it apparently doesn't import milk powder, or very little. Likewise for Libya, which is right next to Algeria, although it has only 6 million people. Egypt has about 100 million people and is similar to Algeria in some respects, yet it imports no milk powder.
