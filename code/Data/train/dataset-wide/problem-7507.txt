Since $Z$ is right orthogonal to every component of the adjunction unit, it is in particular right orthogonal to $\eta_Z : Z \to R Z$. Thus $\eta_Z : Z \to R Z$ admits a retraction, say $r : R Z \to Z$. Let $a = \eta_Z \circ r$. It is an idempotent endomorphism of $R Z$. But $\eta_Z \circ r = R r \circ \eta_{R Z}$, and both $\eta_{R Z} : R Z \to R R Z$ and $R r : R R Z \to R Z$ are isomorphisms, so $a$ is an idempotent automorphism of $R Z$, i.e. $a = \mathrm{id}_Z$. That implies $\eta_Z : Z \to R Z$ is an isomorphism. We may therefore conclude that $Z$ is isomorphic to an object in the reflective subcategory. Moreover, if the reflective subcategory is replete, then $Z$ itself is in the reflective subcategory. 

There are many equivalent ways of defining the local equivalences. Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a simplicial model category with a cofibrant replacement functor $Q : \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}$. Then, for a fibrant object $Z$, define $$\mathbf{R}\mathrm{Hom} (-, Z) = \mathrm{Hom} (Q {-}, Z)$$ where the RHS is the simplicially enriched hom-functor. (Note that we may take $Q = \mathrm{id}$ if every object in $\mathcal{M}$ is cofibrant.) This gives a very convenient model of the homotopy function complex. Now, fix a class $\mathcal{R}$ of fibrant objects in $\mathcal{M}$ that is closed under cotensoring, i.e. if $Z$ is a member of $\mathcal{R}$ and $K$ is a simplicial set, then there is an object $Z^K$ in $\mathcal{M}$ that is a member of $\mathcal{R}$ with an isomorphism $$\mathrm{Hom}_\mathbf{sSet} (K, \mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{M} (-, Z)) \cong \mathrm{Hom}_\mathcal{M} (-, Z^K)$$ of simplicially enriched functors $\mathcal{M} \to \mathbf{sSet}$. For example, the class of (fibrant) $\mathcal{S}$-local objects in $\mathcal{M}$ is such a class. 

Your second question is actually independent of the first one – Grothendieck topologies and sheaf conditions are irrelevant here. Again, we start with a general fact: 

It is well-known that the theories whose category of models are monadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ are necessarily algebraic (possibly infinitary), and conversely every (possibly infinitary) algebraic theory that admits freely-generated models on every set has a category of models that is monadic over $\mathbf{Set}$. See, for instance, Linton's papers in the Seminar on triples and cohomology. For an example of a non-algebraic theory, consider the theory of fields. This is not monadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ because e.g. the category of fields does not have products. 

Question. Does the quotation in the title appear in the writings of Frank Adams? Or was it a spoken remark that has been transmitted through folklore? (I apologise for the non-mathematical question, but I thought MathOverflow would be the most likely place to find the answer.) 

Question. Do these notions coincide? To what extent is each one the ‘right’ notion of finiteness for homotopy types? For instance, are these precisely the homotopy types $X$ such that the representable functor $\mathrm{Hom}(X, -) : \infty \mathbf{Grpd} \to \infty \mathbf{Grpd}$ preserves (homotopy) filtered colimits? 

Adámek and Rosický [On sifted colimits and generalized varieties] have shown that a category $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to the category of models for a (finitary) Lawvere theory in $\mathbf{Set}$ if and only if it satisfies these conditions: 

In the case where $\mathcal{C}$ is essentially small, $\hat{\mathcal{C}}$ is equivalent to $[\mathcal{C}^\mathrm{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$; in general, it is a certain full subcategory. (Note that we may take "locally small" in the weak sense of "hom-sets are small sets", without any condition on the set of objects.) 

To amplify Qiaochu's answer (and answer S. Carnahan's question), I'd like to add that the forgetful functor $[\mathcal{C}, \textbf{Ab}]_{\textbf{Ab}} \to [\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{C}, \textbf{Set}]$ is (finitary) monadic. The easiest way to see this is to treat functors $\mathcal{C} \to \textbf{Ab}$ as a many-sorted finitary algebraic theory, with one copy of the group operation symbols for each object of $\mathcal{C}$ and one function symbol for each morphism of $\mathcal{C}$. Of course, the axioms of this algebraic theory simply express the following: 

This is a generalisation of the usual definition of group object in a cartesian monoidal category because every object in a cartesian monoidal category is a comonoid in a unique way. (This is a fun exercise.) The coordinate ring of any affine group scheme (over $\operatorname{Spec} A$) will also give examples in the category of $A$-modules. 

We can detect the difference between the two constructions using the homotopy category. Given any simplicially enriched category $\mathcal{C}$, we can construct an ordinary category $\pi_0 [\mathcal{C}]$ by applying $\pi_0$ to the hom-spaces. (This makes sense because $\pi_0 : \mathbf{sSet} \to \mathbf{Set}$ preserves finite products.) One might call the morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$ that become isomorphisms in $\pi_0 [\mathcal{C}]$ "(simplicial) homotopy equivalences". Now, in general, $\mathcal{C}$ is not fibrant (i.e. a Kan-enriched category) – but we can fibrantly replace it by applying $\mathrm{Ex}^\infty : \mathbf{sSet} \to \mathbf{sSet}$ to its hom-spaces. Of course, the induced functor $\pi_0 [\mathcal{C}] \to \pi_0 [\mathrm{Ex}^\infty [\mathcal{C}]]$ is an isomorphism, and the homotopy coherent nerve of $\mathrm{Ex}^\infty [\mathcal{C}]$ is a quasicategory whose homotopy category is isomorphic to $\pi_0 [\mathcal{C}]$. On the other hand, if $\mathcal{C}$ is the hammock localisation of a model category $\mathcal{M}$ (not necessarily simplicial), then $\pi_0 [\mathcal{C}]$ is isomorphic to $\operatorname{Ho} \mathcal{M}$. But even if $\mathcal{M}$ is a simplicial model category, $\pi_0 [\mathcal{M}]$ and $\operatorname{Ho} \mathcal{M}$ need not be isomorphic. (Exercise: Show this is the case for $\mathcal{M} = \mathbf{sSet}$ with the Kan–Quillen model structure.) Thus, $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{M}$ need not be weakly equivalent, so the homotopy coherent nerves of their fibrant replacements need not be equivalent. (Recall that the homotopy coherent nerve is a right Quillen equivalence!) Finally, if $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{cf}$ is the (simplicially enriched) full subcategory of cofibrant–fibrant objects in a simplicial model category $\mathcal{M}$, then $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{cf}$ is fibrant, and as Aaron says, it is a theorem of Dwyer and Kan that $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{cf}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ are weakly equivalent. Hence the homotopy coherent nerves of $\mathcal{M}_\mathrm{cf}$ and $\mathrm{Ex}^\infty [\mathcal{C}]$ are equivalent. 

If $X$ is finite, then as a mere category $\mathbf{Fin}_{/ X}$ is equivalent to the cartesian power $\mathbf{Fin}^X$. If $X$ is infinite, then $\mathbf{Fin}_{/ X}$ should be thought of as the full subcategory of $\mathbf{Set}^X$ spanned by the $\aleph_0$-compact objects. This is not a particularly nice category – for example it does not have a terminal object. But I suspect what you are interested in has nothing to do with $\mathbf{Fin}_{/ X}$ qua category but rather as some kind of generalised orbifold. So let us topologise it. Let $\mathbb{C}$ be an internal category in a category $\mathcal{E}$ with finite limits. Then we can speak of internal presheaves on $\mathbb{C}$ (i.e. "internal" functors $\mathbb{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathcal{E}$): such a thing consists of an object $F$, a morphism $p : F \to \operatorname{ob} \mathbb{C}$, and a right action of $\mathbb{C}$ on $F$ (i.e. a morphism $F \times_{\operatorname{ob} \mathbb{C}} \operatorname{mor} \mathbb{C} \to F$ making various diagrams commute; note the pullback is of $\operatorname{codom} : \operatorname{mor} \mathbb{C} \to \operatorname{ob} \mathbb{C}$, not $\operatorname{dom}$). One can then form another internal category, say $\mathbb{F}$, where $\operatorname{ob} \mathbb{F} = F$ and $\operatorname{mor} \mathbb{F} = F \times_{\operatorname{ob} \mathbb{C}} \operatorname{mor} \mathbb{C}$, and there is an internal "discrete" fibration $\mathbb{F} \to \mathbb{C}$. (Here "discrete" is meant in the categorical sense, not topological!) Now, when $\mathcal{E} = \mathbf{Top}$ and $\mathbb{C}$ is topologically discrete, an internal presheaf on $\mathbb{C}$ is the same thing as a functor $\mathbb{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathbf{Top}$. In particular we can do this for $\mathbb{C}$ the category of finite cardinals and $F$ the presheaf defined by $F (n) = X^n$. The ordinary category corresponding to the internal category $\mathbb{F}$ is easily seen to be the comma category $(\mathbb{C} \downarrow X)$, so we have achieved the desired topologisation. More explicitly, $\operatorname{ob} \mathbb{F}$ is the disjoint union $\coprod_{n \in \mathbb{N}} X^n$, and $\operatorname{mor} \mathbb{F}$ is the disjoint union $\coprod_{f : m \to n} X^n$. Since $\operatorname{codom} : \operatorname{mor} \mathbb{C} \to \operatorname{ob} \mathbb{C}$ is a local homeomorphism, the same is true for $\operatorname{codom} : \operatorname{mor} \mathbb{F} \to \operatorname{ob} \mathbb{F}$. Thus, if we restrict to the maximal subgroupoid $\mathbb{G} \subseteq \mathbb{F}$, we have a so-called étale topological groupoid. (Strictly speaking we must check that inversion is a homeomorphism, but we could just run through the above arguments replacing $\mathbb{C}$ with its maximal subgroupoid.) In the case where $X$ is sober and locally compact, we can equally regard $\mathbb{G}$ as an étale localic groupoid. Either way, we can define the topos $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{G})$ of equivariant sheaves on $\mathbb{G}$ (= internal presheaves $P$ on $\mathbb{G}$ where the map $P \to \operatorname{ob} \mathbb{G}$ is a local homeomorphism) – the so-called classifying topos of $\mathbb{G}$. It should go without saying that the orbit space of $\mathbb{G}$ is just the disjoint union of the configuration spaces of $X$. One could also ask about sheaves on $\mathbb{F}$, but the subject of sheaves on topological categories seems to be less well-studied. It is the case that $\mathbf{Sh}(\mathbb{F})$ is a topos. One reference for this is [Moerdijk, Classifying spaces and classifying topoi]. 

When $\mathcal{A}$ is a finite category, the finitely presentable objects in $[\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{C}]$ are precisely the diagrams that are componentwise finitely presentable: see e.g. Proposition 2.23 here. The general case is harder to describe. There are two steps: 

As Daniel Schäppi pointed out, this is the same as asking whether the composite of two monadic functors is monadic. The answer, unfortunately, is no. Consider locally presentable categories. By the classification theorem, every locally presentable category can be embedded as a reflective subcategory of some presheaf topos. It is not hard to see that a fully faithful functor with a left adjoint is automatically monadic. On the other hand, $[\mathcal{A}^\mathrm{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$ is monadic over $\mathbf{Set}^{\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}}$, as one might expect for a multi-sorted algebraic theory. Thus, for any locally presentable category $\mathcal{C}$, there exist a small category $\mathcal{A}$ and monadic functors $$\mathcal{C} \to [\mathcal{A}^\mathrm{op}, \mathbf{Set}] \to \mathbf{Set}^{\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}}$$ but in general the composite $\mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}^{\operatorname{ob} \mathcal{A}}$ is not monadic. Indeed, it can be shown that any category monadic over $\mathbf{Set}^I$ (for some set $I$) must be an effective regular (= Barr-exact) category. But this is not true for a general locally presentable category, such as $\mathbf{Cat}$ or $\mathbf{Poset}$. 

For example, the left regular action of $M$ on itself is a point of $\mathcal{B} M$, and as it happens, this point covers all of $\mathcal{B} M$. However, what we need to find is an open cover of $\mathcal{B} M$. The Butz–Moerdijk construction yields such a thing. Let $K$ be a fixed set of cardinality $\ge \left| M \right|$. An enumeration of $M$ is a partial surjection $K \rightharpoonup M$ with infinite fibres. An isomorphism of enumerations of $M$ is an isomorphism of left $M$-sets making the following diagram commute: $$\require{AMScd} \begin{CD} K @= K \\ @VVV @VVV \\ M @>>> M \end{CD}$$ Choose a representative in each isomorphism class of enumerations of $M$. We define a groupoid $\mathbb{G}$ as follows: 

Step 2 of your question is also related to the Yoneda embedding, but in a more subtle way. In effect, it is externalising the internal monoid $M$ by considering its left self-action. This is basically an appeal to the monoid version of Cayley's theorem, which is sometimes considered a special case of the Yoneda embedding. Personally, I don't see a connection with the Kleisli category construction. Perhaps one can regard the "embedding" of $\mathcal{C}(I, X)$ into $\mathcal{C}(X, X)$ as an instance of a "funny composition", but I don't think there's anything deeper than that. 

There is in fact no difference between the two definitions if you take your site to be the category of affine schemes – while it is true that the forgetful functor from sheaves to presheaves does not preserve colimits in general, for the purposes of this definition, only filtered colimits matter, and those are preserved. Indeed, recall that the Zariski topology is a Grothendieck topology "of finite type", i.e. generated by a pretopology consisting only of finite covering families. For such Grothendieck topologies, it is straightforward to verify that the category of sheaves is closed under filtered colimits in the category of presheaves – after all, in this case, the sheaf condition amounts to saying that certain cocones under finite diagrams of affine schemes are mapped to limiting cones in the category of sets. 

Bizarrely enough, this is a pointwise left Kan extension – so the proof is a direct calculation. If $\gamma : \mathcal{C} \to \operatorname{Ho} \mathcal{C}$ has a (necessarily fully faithful) right adjoint, then this can also be calculated using a right deformation. I think the converse is also true, but at any rate, right deformations usually do not exist. 

Since you mentioned locally presentable categories, I'll give one sufficient condition involving that. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a locally finitely presentable additive category. Then the canonical morphism $\sum_{i \in I} A_i \to \prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is a monomorphism. This is true when $I$ is finite because $\mathcal{A}$ is additive. Suppose $I$ is (possibly) infinite. Then $\sum_{i \in I} A_i$ is a filtered colimit of all its finite "sub-coproducts". But for any finite subset $I' \subseteq I$, the canonical morphism $\sum_{i \in I'} A_i \cong \prod_{i \in I'} A_i \to \prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is a (split!) monomorphism, and filtered colimits preserve monomorphisms, so the canonical morphism $\sum_{i \in I} A_i \to \prod_{i \in I} A_i$ is indeed a monomorphism. In fact, all we really needed was Grothendieck's axiom AB5 (in addition to AB3 and AB3*, of course), i.e. that filtered colimits in $\mathcal{A}$ are exact. 

No. The category of models of an equational theory (i.e. a variety in the sense of universal algebra) is always a regular category, but the category of posets is not regular. 

Given an orthogonal (resp. weak) factorisation system $(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{M})$, we can straightforwardly define when a sink $( U_i \to V : i \in I )$ (where the morphisms $U_i \to V$ may be repeated) is in the left class $\mathcal{E}$: this happens when, for each morphism $X \to Y$ in $\mathcal{M}$, given a commutative square of the form below for each $i$ in $I$, $$\begin{array}{ccc} U_i & \rightarrow & X \\ \downarrow & & \downarrow \\ V & \rightarrow & Y \end{array}$$ there is a unique (resp. at least one) morphism $V \to X$ that makes all the evident diagrams commute simultaneously. In the presence of sufficiently large coproducts, this happens if and only if the amalgamation $\coprod_{i \in I} U_i \to V$ is in $\mathcal{E}$. 

Question. Let $\mathbb{T}$ be a coherent theory that can be defined in reasonable metatheories – so perhaps the metatheory is an extension of higher order Heyting arithmetic and $\mathbb{T}$ is a recursive theory in a language with countably many sorts. Let $\phi \vdash \psi$ be a sequent in (the language of) $\mathbb{T}$. Can the provability of $\phi \vdash \psi$ depend on the metatheory? Of course one could cheat and define $\mathbb{T}$ so that, say, $\mathbb{T}$ is inconsistent when some condition is satisfied in the metatheory. I'm more interested in those theories $\mathbb{T}$ where every reasonable metatheory agrees on the axioms of $\mathbb{T}$ – perhaps such that every reasonable metatheory agrees on whether a given standard natural number codes an axiom of $\mathbb{T}$, if that makes sense. 

Of course, logicians will point out that the above is really a "metatheorem" because functors $\mathbf{Set} \to \mathbf{Set}$ are not elements of the universe of discourse, but that's not really important. (Since you mention it, the "existence" of $\mathbf{Set}(A, -)$ is never a problem: it may not be an element of the universe, but what it does is perfectly well-defined.) One can avoid this particular issue of metatheorem vs theorem by switching from ZFC to NBG, but if you prefer to avoid having to think about fine distinctions like that at all, you should just bite the bullet and use a Grothendieck universe. (My preference nowadays is to assume a Grothendieck universe inside Mac Lane set theory.) 

Here's a reasonably "natural" example of a pair of pretopologies that generate the same topology. We consider the category $\textbf{Top}$ of topological spaces, or any full subcategory $\mathbf{T}$ thereof closed under pullbacks and open subsets. 

Your proof is correct and your "counterexample" is wrong. Here's how I prefer to think of the definition of "covering-flat": a diagram $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ is covering-flat if and only if, for every finite diagram $X : \mathcal{I} \to \mathcal{C}$, the comparison morphism $F_! \varprojlim\nolimits_\mathcal{I} h_X \to \varprojlim\nolimits_\mathcal{I} h_{F X}$ in $[\mathcal{D}^\mathrm{op}, \mathbf{Set}]$ is a local epimorphism. (I assume $\mathcal{C}$ is small and $\mathcal{D}$ is locally small; if not, enlarge universe.) In your "counterexample", $\mathcal{D} = \mathbf{Set}$ and $F = \emptyset$. Consider the case $\mathcal{I} = \emptyset$. Then $\varprojlim\nolimits_\mathcal{I} h_{F X} \cong 1$, whereas $F_! \varprojlim\nolimits_\mathcal{I} h_X \cong \varinjlim\nolimits_\mathcal{C} h_F$; but $(\varinjlim\nolimits_\mathcal{C} h_F) (K) = \emptyset$ for all non-empty $K$, so $F_! \varprojlim\nolimits_\mathcal{I} h_X \to \varprojlim\nolimits_\mathcal{I} h_{F X}$ is not a local epimorphism. Hence $F : \mathcal{C} \to \mathbf{Set}$ is not covering-flat. 

First things first: $\check{H}{}^n(U, \mathscr{F})$ (resp. $H^n(U, \mathscr{F})$) are same whether you regard $\mathscr{F}$ as an $\mathscr{O}$-module or as an abelian sheaf, so we may simplify things by considering only abelian sheaves. Let $\mathscr{F}$ be an abelian sheaf and write $\check{H}{}^* (U, -)$ for the right derived functors of $\Gamma(U, (-)^+) : \mathbf{AbPsh}(\mathcal{C}) \to \mathbf{Ab}$. (Recall, $\mathscr{F}^+$ is the separated presheaf associated with $\mathscr{F}$ and $\Gamma(U, \mathscr{F}^+)$ is the set of presheaf morphisms $\mathfrak{U} \to \mathscr{F}^+$ equipped with the componentwise abelian group structure.) One can check that $\check{H}{}^* (U, -)$ defined in this way agrees with the "classical" construction via filtered colimits over covers of $U$. Let $\mathscr{H}^* (-)$ be the right derived functors of the forgetful functor $\mathbf{AbSh}(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{\tau}) \to \mathbf{AbPsh}(\mathcal{C})$. (It is not hard to check that $\mathscr{H}^* (\mathscr{F})$ is the presheaf defined by $C \mapsto H^* (C, \mathscr{F})$, where $H^* (C, -)$ are the right derived functors of $\Gamma (C, -) : \mathbf{AbSh}(\mathcal{C}, \tau) \to \mathbf{Ab}$.) Note that the sheaf condition implies $\check{H}{}^0 (U, \mathscr{H}^0 (\mathscr{F}))$ is naturally isomorphic to $\Gamma (U, \mathscr{F})$, while the forgetful functor $\mathbf{AbSh}(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{\tau}) \to \mathbf{AbPsh}(\mathcal{C})$ preserves injective objects, so we may construct the Grothendieck spectral sequence:
