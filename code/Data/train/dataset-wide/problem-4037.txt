You are in the best position to judge how much notice you can safely give and still achieve your objective of working right up until you leave. You should base your decision on your relationship with your manager. Do you think he would have your back and try as hard as possible to accommodate your wishes? Do you think he has the leverage to do so within your company? I've worked with folks who had similar plans. And because I had a good relationship with them and felt that they were trying to do right by the company, I was able to help make it happen. And I've worked for bosses who did the same for others. If you don't feel safe, then you might be forced to give only the minimum notice required and expected in your locale. When you give the notice to your manager, you could even indicate that you wished you could have given more, but didn't feel that it would be "safe" with HR to do so. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone outside your company can give you good advice as to the actual safe notice period. We simply don't have enough insight into your company's culture, your HR's practices, and your relationship with your boss. 

You haven't indicated if these "future employers" will be for contract positions, or permanent positions. I'll touch on both of them, and I think the same thoughts apply to each in differing degrees. Whenever I hire a contractor, I always ask when interviewing if they have any planned time off during the contract. That time away may or may not preclude my hiring them - depending on the length of the contract, and the length and timing of the vacation. If I have a 2-year contract, a few weeks away isn't likely to cause any problems. If I have a 3-month contract, a few weeks right in the middle of crunch time likely means that this candidate isn't a good fit. When I hire a permanent employee, I also ask about planned time away. A few weeks here isn't likely to matter since I can always advance some vacation time that isn't yet accrued. Many weeks or months may make a difference though. Sometimes it means delaying the start date until after the vacation time is consumed, on rare occasions it means that the candidate isn't a good fit. Either way, if the interviewer doesn't ask, you should bring up your planned time off at some point during the interview. My suggestion is to wait until you are at the acceptance point - the point where you and the company have determined that you are a good fit, you have agreed on a rate, and are perhaps just exploring details or negotiating benefits. You need to decide ahead of time how flexible you want to be. Would you consider cancelling one of your planned vacations? Ten weeks of time off is a lot in my part of the world. Currently my company offers two weeks of paid vacation to new hires. To accommodate someone with a need for eight additional weeks off is difficult. It can be done for the right person, but that person would have to be exceptional. And let's be honest here - by definition, very few people are exceptional. If you are planning on contracting, you can certainly work around your vacations. Plan on taking gigs that don't clash with your planned time off. It will take you longer to find such contracts, but that could help balance your professional reputation with your need for free time. If instead you are planning to seek a permanent position, you might want to make sure your vacation bookings are all refundable. That way, you won't need to turn down a dream job just because you have already booked an expensive vacation and can't get your money back. Try to be as flexible in your planning as you can, and when you can't be flexible, be very open and honest with your potential employer. You don't want to surprise a new boss with "Oh, I didn't mention it during the interview, but I need these 10 weeks off." That's a poor way to start off any new job, and could lead to a major conflict if the request for time off is denied. Maybe you really don't need a job right away? In that case, it might be easier to get these vacations behind you before concentrating all your energies on finding the right job for you. 

If the company doesn't formally solicit input from all the project managers of each employee, then apparently that's their norm. In this scenario, your best course of action is to write up a brief review of each employee on each of your projects and pass it along to the appropriate reviewing manager. Don't expect much impact from your review - just do it out of courtesy. I doubt there are any "lines" between which you should try to read about yourself here. 

Unless the "rating" you received is such that people outside your company will understand it completely, it may not be helpful. "Received a 'Top 10 Salesman' rating" would be useful where "Attained a 'Good Job' rating" might not. In short, within your resume you should concentrate on the roles and responsibilities and not so much on the names of the projects and the names of the ratings. You can use the cover letter to highlight more specifics if and only if they are relevant for the new job. And use the interview itself to expound on the details of the project that make you a particularly appealing candidate. 

Remember that uniqueness does not imply value. And uniqueness doesn't imply protection against layoffs. If you are truly a jack-of-all-trades, that means you might be able to fill in for anyone - and that has a ton of value by itself. I once worked at a startup that grew to almost 300 people before going public. As soon as they went public, things started going south, and a series of layoffs began. The layoffs did not leave the "unique" individuals untouched. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Those who were basically only good at one thing were the first to go. The jack-of-all-trades types were around until quite near the end, handling multiple responsibilities. Unfortunately, there are no sure fire ways to avoid ever being laid off. The best you can do is provide as much value as you can in whatever areas you can. Be positive, upbeat, work hard, and pitch in to help whoever and whenever you can. Then, don't make too much money and get lucky. There's only so much you can control.
