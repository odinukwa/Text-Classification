These can give a pretty good description of a system of bodies. You can't model day and night, but you can satisfy your other criteria. By the way, the system is free. 

As to the whole killing-Hitler idea. . . Well, we can only make assumptions from there. Or ask the folks at Alternative History. 

Put your planetary system at a safe distance from a star-forming region, where you might see larger GCR fluxes. Make the central star one with low stellar activity. 

Thank, thank you, thank you for not putting it too close to the central star. I know that this is a terrestrial planet, so it wouldn't be a hot Jupiter, but conditions there would be just as brutal. In fact, we can calculate just how brutal they would be by calculating the planetary equilibrium temperature: $$T = \left(\frac{L_{\odot}(1-a)}{16 \sigma \pi D^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}$$ We can approximation that $L_{\odot} \approx L_{\text{Sun}}=3.846 \times 10^{26}$. As another approximation, $a=0.3$. We also know that $\sigma=5.670 \times 10^{-8}$. Plugging this all in, $$T = \left(\frac{3.846 \times 10^{26}(1-0.3)}{16 \times 5.670 \times 10^{-8}\pi D^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}=9.85856 \times 10^7 \times D^{-\frac{1}{2}}$$ At $D_V$, $D_E$, and $D_M$, this comes out to $$T_V=299.986 \text{ K}$$ $$T_E=254.547 \text{ K}$$ $$T_M=207.515 \text{ K}$$ As far as approximations go, those are pretty similar to what we see, give or take a few dozen Kelvin (with the exception of Venus, which got screwed over by greenhouse gases). Mars' approximation is actually accurate to within a few Kelvin. Earth is the only one which is off, and that's only by about 30 Kelvin. That's pretty good. Tempted though I am to add in a fudge factor, I grudgingly admit that the model works for Mars, and there are a whole bunch of things on Earth (cough cough water, land and humans) which influence its results. Using kinetic energy, we can relate the root mean square speed of a particle to its temperature via $$v=\sqrt{\frac{3kT}{m}}$$ At each of the radii, we have a different relation: $$v_V=\sqrt{\frac{3 \times 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \times 299.986}{m}} \approx \frac{1.11 \times 10^{-10}}{\sqrt{m}}$$ $$v_E=\sqrt{\frac{3 \times 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \times 254.547}{m}} \approx \frac{1.03 \times 10^{-10}}{\sqrt{m}}$$ $$v_M=\sqrt{\frac{3 \times 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \times 207.515}{m}} \approx \frac{9.27 \times 10^{-11}}{\sqrt{m}}$$ If the root mean square speed is greater than escape velocity, then some of the atmosphere will escape. $$v_{\text{escape}}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$ I hope you'll excuse me if I don't do the calculations, because $$3 \text{ planets} \times 4 \text{ gases} = 12 \text{ numbers} = 1 \text{ headache for me}$$ I'll do one, though, for an important gas: molecular oxygen. For O2, $m_{\text{one molecule}}=4.98 \times 10^{-26} \text{ kilograms}$ (see here for the actual mass of 1 AMU). This gives us $$v_V=497.4$$ $$v_E=461.554$$ $$v_M=415.399$$ Assuming that $r=R_E=6371000 \text{ meters}$, we get $$v_{\text{escape}}=\sqrt{M} \times 4.5969 \times 10^{-9}$$ Then calculating the mass, we get $$M_V=1.1708 \times 10^{22} \text{ kilograms}$$ $$M_E=1.00813 \times 10^{22} \text{ kilograms}$$ $$M_M=8/16548 \times 10^{21} \text{ kilograms}$$ 

As Wikipedia notes, $$t_{\text{lock}} \approx \frac{\omega a^6IQ}{3Gm_p^2k_2R^5}$$ where $a$ is the semi-major axis, $m_p$ is the mass of the primary, $\omega$ is the initial angular speed, and the other variables describe the secondary planet. Clearly, these properties will vary based on the different initial setups. Even a change in $a$ by a mere factor of 2 will increase the timescale by a factor of 64. This does lead us to the interesting question of whether or not there are "preferred" semi-major axes - that is, whether or not Earth-like binaries are more likely to have semi-major axes within some range. I would wager there are, stemming from the formation of the planets, but I don't have any hard facts on that yet. All of the other factors, though, should be easy to determine because we can figure them out by knowing the properties of terrestrial planets. 

So, you've got at least three distinct groups with stakes in getting to the summit. They will probably attempt to take different approaches, at least in the early years - first trying to figure out what the best way to get to the top is, if there is a way. Now, I was wondering before if everyone will know how high the mountain is. After all, with 1920s technology, they can't just fly up in an X-15 or something and get a good view from above. However, I think that with ground-based surveying, this might be possible. The height of Mount Everest was known to within a good margin by the middle of the 19th century. This mountain's ten times as high, but that doesn't mean it can't be surveyed. It will stand out from the other mountains around it - if there are any. On a very, very clear day, it's possible that the top could be seen from the ground. If not, then lower limits can be placed on its height. Group 1: The climbers From surveying, would-be climbers will figure out that it's at least 50,000 feet[citation needed], maybe more, even if they can't get a good estimate. If they've gone up any significant peak - say, 25,000 feet or above - then they have a good idea of the limits of the human body. Nobody is going to try to summit on the first attempt, and nobody is going to try to do it with only basic technology. Those who do will die. Quickly. So, instead, you're probably going to see a period of technological development with partial attempts to establish camps at different elevations, like the system currently used on Mount Everest and elsewhere. Mount Everest obviously was not summited on the first attempt; there were many attempts made over many decades. I say it take 50 years - at a minimum - to reach 40,000 feet. And that's nowhere near the summit. It's possible that the climbers are going to eventually give up going by foot. Perhaps they (minus the climbing purists) will try vehicles, like cars, when they become rugged enough. But even custom-built vehicles will have problems, and there will be points where they can't cross. In 50 miles of mountain, you'll have places like the Hillary Step that almost certainly would need to be crossed on foot. What other technology might the climbers come up with? Supplemental oxygen, obviously. They won't turn back until they've tried that. Other things they might create: 

A city planet Take Coruscant, from Star Wars. It's a planet covered entirely by one large, sprawling, complex city. I'm not sure if there's a canonical reference to how high the tallest buildings are, but from the seeing aerial$^1$ views it looks like they're taller than cities on Earth. Taller buildings mean bigger shadows; bigger shadows means more darkness; more darkness means less area on the ground - if any - to collect solar power. On a planet covered in one city, the upper levels would become rather valuable, and not just as rooms with views. These rooftops would be the only places where you could gather solar power, because they would effectively drown out all other power-collecting locations. If you own a lot of rooftop space, you can generate a lot of electricity. However, in a city planet, you'd probably have other sources of electricity, so you'd have to eliminate those before solar became the dominant power source. More to the point, could these panels really provide enough electricity to power the whole city? Perhaps, if there are auxiliary power sources that can't meet the population's demands, so solar is needed to fill the energy gap. Now we have to figure out why solar is the only option. Here's how I'd eliminate the other sources: 

Get used to Big Brother or put up with sectarian violence. Your pick. Yes, it's pretty problematic, because there are different social climes in different parts of the world. Different people look different, speak different languages, have different customs, follow different religions, and so forth. It would be nearly impossible to construct a government that is sympathetic to all the different cultural groups in the world. A big issue here is religion. Some countries are strongly ruled by religion. This is problematic in this scenario, because some religious laws in Country X may violate secular laws on Country Y - or worse, religious laws in Country Y. You'd never be able to unite them, because the two ethnic groups would push for different laws that could never be combined. This government would soon dissolve into partisan disputes and, I suspect, secession by various countries. It would not last long. If it did manage to stay together, though, and politicians from everywhere were able to agree to this, you'd still have sectarian violence not condoned by the government. Paramilitary organizations would start fighting wars with each other. The solution? Take away personal freedoms. Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly all lead to sectarian warfare as different people disagree with one another. Big Brother needs to arise and develop very tight control over people. It's not enough to win the hearts and minds of the people. Here, you need to control them, to save them from themselves. 

One partial technique is to create an a posteriori language - that is, to base it off an existing language. Here, J. R. R. Tolkien is quoted explaining how he was inspired to create some of his languages: 

A theory of everything will predict the existence of new particles or new phenomena, typically at high energies, and would take more powerful detectors and colliders to detect them. Obviously, as technology gets better and better, more powerful particle accelerators and colliders will be built. I'm excited in particular about the International Linear Collider and the Future Circular Collider. The Superconducting Super Collider would have been amazing if it had been built, but . . . it was cancelled because of budget issues. The electroweak force provides an excellent example of predictions at high energies being verified - see, as I mentioned before, the discovery of the Higgs boson. Now, it's also possible that we could find evidence for a particular theory of everything in nature - possibly in astrophysical experiments. To use your mention of supersymmetry (SUSY) as an example, certain superpartners are candidates for dark matter. The study of those in various environments could provide support for SUSY - although it's important to consider that supersymmetry does not imply that string theory is right, and string theory doesn't need supersymmetry. They're just close companions, and each works rather nicely with the other. If a theory of everything keeps garnering evidence, eventually it might be accepted as generally correct, although as Secespitus pointed out, a theory can never be proven; it can only be supported by more and more evidence. Maybe we find that a theory makes correct predictions for particles with up to 10 TeV of energy, but at 20 TeV, it fails. If we find that that happens, the theory would have to modified - or thrown away.
