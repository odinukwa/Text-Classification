In outer space, a vacuum isn't what sucks in matter to a black hole. That may be the case for your household vacuum cleaner, but everywhere in outer space is essentially a vacuum. Instead, it's the black hole's powerful gravitational pull. However, black hole can have energy. One type that comes to mind is angular kinetic energy. This is the energy that a spinning object has - in this case, a rotating black hole (see also Kerr black hole and Kerr-Newman black hole). Black holes can also have translational kinetic energy - the energy of an object in motion. Also black holes have gravitational potential energy - potential energy due to gravity - and black holes with electric charge can have electric potential energy. So black holes do have energy, although perhaps not in the form you thought. Keep asking good questions! I hope this helps. 

However, you can't just put a planet anywhere near a black hole, give it a strong enough push, and hope it orbits. The innermost orbit is at the boundary of the photon sphere. On this sphere, only photons can orbit. Inside it, nothing can orbit. However, the only stable orbit is twice as far away, at $2r_p$. The radius of the sphere is $$r_p=\frac{3GM}{c^2}$$ We'll assume that the object is not rotating (I don't remember exactly if it is or isn't rotating, but it's simpler in this demo to say it isn't.). The formula for gravitational time dilation is $$t_0=t_f \sqrt{1-\frac{3r_0}{2r_f}}$$ where $$r_0=\frac{2GM}{c^2}$$ Assuming that $t_0$ (the time for the observer inside the field) is two hours (7200 seconds) and $t_f$ is ten years (315360000 seconds), $$\frac{t_0}{t_f}=\frac{1}{43800}=1-\frac{(3)2GM}{(2)r_fc^2}$$ Simplifying, and saying that $\frac{2GM}{c^2}=\frac{2}{3}r_p$, $$\frac{r_p}{r_f}=\frac{43799}{43800}$$ $$r_f \approx 1.0000228315715 r_p$$ which is outside the photon sphere, but just barely. However, it's well inside $2r_p$, and so most likely instable. The planet is, in short, not going to survive for long. And so giant waves - mini-spoiler - are the least of Matthew McConaughey's problems.

They cover existing and future telescopes, at energies from the gamma-ray spectrum to radio waves. You are correct, too, in assuming that adaptive optics can cause dramatic increases in angular resolution; CHARA and the European Extremely Large Telescope both use adaptive optics, and actually can have better angular resolutions than some space-based telescopes. I annotated the graph to cover in green the smallest angular resolution at various wavelengths:

The pair instability realm is upwards of ~100 solar masses, though it is metallicity-dependent (Question 3). As Figure 1 (below) shows, neutron stars form in the mass range of >9 solar masses - again, this is metallicity-dependent (Question 1a). Starting at around 25 solar masses, black holes will form (Question 1b). 

I understand that "noticeable", at the least, is a bit subjective, but I can't come up with any non-arbitrary criteria to change that. 

I figured I might as well expand my earlier comment into an answer, as I've cobbled together some more information. You're talking about the cyclic model, which states that the universe goes through cycles of Big Bangs and Big Crunches. We live in the middle of one of those cycles. Albert Einstein was one of the first to investigate it, but his efforts came to nothing. The theory has been reincarnated, most recently in 2002 by Paul Steinhardt and Neil Turok. They propose that the cosmological constant has changed over time, which could make the accelerating expansion of the universe fit into the theory. Another good article on their idea can be found here. Roger Penrose has also come up with a theory - Conformal Cyclic Cosmology - along similar lines as Einstein's. You can use this as a starting point for more reading. A related topic is the Big Bounce, which attempts to address the Big Bangs and Big Crunches. 

However, further observations might help us learn more about the planet and determine if it could be habitable for any type of life. It should be noted that the controversy about planets around Alpha Centauri continued after this question was initially answered by user8. Alpha Centauri Bb was shown to be nonexistent by Rajpaul et al. (2015). However, in another twist, observations by Demory et al. (2015) seemed to show the existence of Alpha Centauri Bc (at the time, Alpha Centauri Bb was still a possibility, so now "Alpha Centauri Bc" would actually be "Alpha Centauri Bb" if it existed), an Earth-like planet. However, there has been no more evidence to confirm the existence of this planet - and at any rate, Proxima Centauri is closer to the Solar System than Alpha Centauri, so Proxima Centauri b wins no matter what. 

NASA has three pages on the different types, though it uses "composite" in place of "mixed", designating "composite" nebulae "Crab-like", after the Crab nebula. The shape of a remnant depends on which type it is; for instance, composite nebulae may be shaped by the stellar wind of the central pulsar. Interstellar nebulae H II regions (which include the Eagle Nebula, and of course the Pillars of Creation) and dark nebulae fall into this category. Both may be part of or interact with molecular clouds, which are the star-forming regions of the galaxy. H II regions, like molecular clouds, are shaped by the stars inside them. Radiation ionizes and even pushes away the gas surrounding young, hot stars, breaking up the nebulae. However, variations in dust density mean that different parts may "evaporate" at different rates, leading to some weird shapes - including the Pillars of Creation. Evolution and dissipation When I first read your question, I focused on the phrase (emphasis mine) 

At the moment, the Solar System is inside the Local Interstellar Cloud (which is itself within the Local Bubble). The LIC has a neutral hydrogen number density of $\sim0.1\text{ cm}^{-3}$, which is a bit lower than the mean galactic neutral hydrogen number density. The Local Bubble itself is less dense than the LIC, by about one or two orders of magnitude. On the whole, this region of space is less dense than the ISM, on average. So, if we take atomic hydrogen density to be a good benchmark, then the LIC and surrounding regions are in fact less dense than the Solar System on average. 

AR Scorpii1 appears to be an example. It is a binary system, consisting of a white dwarf and an M-type red dwarf. It was apparently originally classified as a $\delta$ Scuti variable star, but it was later discovered to be a true close binary, with a period of 3.56 hours. The white dwarf emits pulses, as discovered by Marsh et al. (2016), with a period of about two minutes. These are visible in wavelengths from ultraviolet to radio (see Fig. 2): 

I checked the Multiple Star Catalog for data on these systems. It has hierarchical information on Nu Scorpii and AR Cassiopeiae, which I also used for this answer. I'll try to explain the orbital structure of both systems. Nu Scorpii Think of Nu Scorpii as two subsets of stars, Nu Scorpii AB and Nu Scorpii CD, orbiting each other with a period of 105,000 years. AB contains four stars: 

Now, rings have not been observed around Trans-Neptunian Objects in similar stellar occultation data, leading the authors to hypothesize that centaurs are a separate population. More observations could shed some light on this hypothesis. A final interesting point I'd like to make is that many moons around minor planets have been found, but only one or two ring systems are known. 

I think I know what they mean. They're talking about a false vacuum scenario. A vacuum state is a state of lowest energy. It's thought that the vacuum of our universe is in a lowest-energy state and is stable, and so nothing special will happen to spacetime. However, if our universe is actually a false vacuum, then it could merely be metastable, and some tiny perturbation could cause it to fall into a lower energy state - a true vacuum, or else a false vacuum of lower energy. The "bubble" that would appear would be a region of this lower-energy vacuum that would expand across the universe without stopping. Scientists aren't sure if our universe is a false vacuum. Here's a chart of the masses of the Higgs boson and the top quark: 

Note that these brown dwarfs are very low-mass, only a bit more massive than hot Jupiters. They can have orbiting gas giants - why couldn't high-mass hot Jupiters have the same? 

The Sun does not have nearly enough mass to become a supernova. Instead, it will swell to become a red giant, enveloping Mercury, Venus, and possibly Earth. After that, it will shed its outer layers as a planetary nebula, and settle down to become a white dwarf. Wikipedia, apparently, says the exact same things I had though of: 

Did you get this from Wikipedia? If you did, I sympathize; all the entries related to this give no explanation for the phenomenon. If you didn't go there . . . Well, it won't answer your question. But I think I've found the answer somewhere else. I'll go over some background stuff for anyone out there who doesn't know much about this, to make it a bit clearer (although you should be able to skip all this). Protostars are small pre-pre-main-sequence objects. At first, they aren't more than small clumps of gas and dust in a stellar nursery (a special nebula, perhaps). Soon, though, more matter begins to come towards a clump, and gradually the clump builds up enough matter that it begins a slight gravitational collapse into a definite object. Temperatures build, and eventually the object becomes a pre-main-sequence star. These pre-main-sequence stars begin to accrete matter (here's where you should stop dozing off) into a circumstellar disk. At the moment, it doesn't matter if the disk will become a protoplanetary disk or something completely different; for now, we can treat it as a circumstellar accretion disk. Matter "falls" into the disk and towards the star; the star absorbs most of it. However, something else comes into play, and that's the star's magnetic field. A lot of objects in the universe have magnetic fields, and a young pre-main-sequence star is no exception. It's field may be stronger than that of the Earth - so strong, in fact, that some of the matter in the circumstellar accretion disk follows slightly different paths than it normally would - paths along the field lines of the star's magnetic field. While there isn't enough evidence (scarcely any at all, really) to support or, more importantly, disprove this idea, it is though that the magnetic field lines lead the matter towards a point on the star, perhaps at its poles, and then compress it together into an astrophysical jet (or bipolar outflow) that shoots out into space. Such jets are often associated with other cool phenomena, such as Herbig-Haro objects. So for everyone who considers this post a "Too long; didn't read" answer, here's a summary: The truth is that nobody really knows. The current explanations for this phenomenon are that they are caused by matter from accretion disks being concentrated by magnetic field lines onto a single (well, double, one on either end of an axis) point, which then becomes an astrophysical jet. I hope this helps. 

LocalFluff's comment is spot-on. You need mass to have gas, and moons just don't have enough. It is thought that gas giants gathered the gas they have today by accreting large amounts of it from the protoplanetary disk in the early days of the Solar System. At first, they were only gas-less cores (not rocky, exactly, but not gaseous), but they quickly became the most massive objects in their immediate vicinities, and thus gobbled up all the gas nearby them. Now, less massive bodies, like Earth, can still accrete gas. However, they have difficulty retaining it. Lammer et al. (2014) calculated that under conditions like those experienced in the young Solar System, planets of one Earth mass or less could retain captured hydrogen envelopes for no more than ~100 million years - a long time for us humans, but shorter for astronomical objects. The hydrogen escapes via atmospheric escape, which happens when particles in the atmosphere have velocities higher than escape velocity. This phenomenon is known as Jeans escape. Atmospheric escape happens more often with lighter gases, such as hydrogen. It is also influenced by stellar winds, which can cause even gas giants (generally close to the star, such as hot Jupiters) to lose some or all of their atmospheres. I wouldn't call gas moons impossible, but certainly very unlikely. 

Thorne and Żytkow's original paper on TŻOs actually opens with a comparison of TŻOs and the type of object you mention, with a white dwarf degenerate core instead of a neutron star degenerate core. They note that the equilibrium states - essentially, stable configurations - of such combinations lie near the Hayashi track (actually acting a bit like AGB stars, in some cases), indicating high metallicity, as is the case with TŻOs. These objects generate energy the same way TŻOs do: matter is accreted by the core, releasing gravitational potential energy, and the red giant envelope continues some fusion, although, of course, core fusion has been substantially disrupted by the arrival of the new degenerate core. The main difference in energy production are the ratios between nuclear contributions to luminosity and gravitational contributions to luminosity: $$L_{\text{nuc}}/L\approx0.99,\quad L_{\text{grav}}/L\approx0.01\quad\text{for white dwarf core}$$ $$L_{\text{nuc}}/L\approx0.04,\quad L_{\text{grav}}/L\approx0.96\quad\text{for neutron core}$$ Why the difference? $L_{\text{grav}}$ is proportional to $$\frac{GM_c}{R_cc^2}$$ where $_c$ refers to values for the core. The masses and radii of neutron stars differ drastically from those of white dwarfs. This becomes less important in the case of supergiant TŻOs (i.e. $M>10 M_{\odot}$), because convection cycles "burned" nuclear fuel back outwards into the envelope, and so energy ratios become more like those found in the case of a white dwarf core. This difference in energy production ratios also means that the objects will remain in roughly stable states for different amounts of time; red giants with white dwarf cores can survive in equilibrium for at least an order of magnitude or more as long as TŻOs. One interesting thing to note is that TŻOs and red giants with white cores may share some of the same problems when it comes to stability. The envelopes are expected to be composed similarly and act similarly, with the potential difference in nuclear fusion rates, and so the same dynamical instabilities are possible in both cases. However, Thorne and Żytkow state that they find this possibility unlikely. 

The simple answer is yes, an asteroid can have rings. The current known example is 10199 Chariklo, whose rings were discovered in 2014 (see Braga-Ribas et al. (2014)). It actually has two rings, at distances of 391 km and 405 km, 7 km and 3km in width. As the discovery paper notes, they may be the (young) remnants of a debris disk around Chariklo, and have some moderately-sized bodies embedded in them. The observations indicated that water ice is likely present. Another small body, 2060 Chiron, may also have rings (see Ortiz et al. (2015)). Again, water ice is thought to be a major component of the putative rings. Both ring systems were hypothesized in part due to evidence from stellar occultations, i.e. cases where the minor body passed in front of a star. Stellar occultations have proved useful in many cases involving small bodies, such as Kuiper Belt Objects. As Ortiz et al. noted, Chariklo and Chiron are the two most massive members of a class of minor planets called centaurs. They orbit (unstable) in between the giant planets of the Solar System. Insights into ring formation around centaurs could perhaps provide information about centaur formation and evolution. It seems likely that the rings form from either
