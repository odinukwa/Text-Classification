All of these governmental entities (because Daesh isn't recognised by any nation) are rated by Amnesty International to have abysmal human rights records. Amnesty International says that in Saudi Arabia, there were over 150 executions, summary judgements are routinely issued, thousands of people have been expelled from the country to dangerous areas, there is government discrimination against Shia muslims, and there are severe restrictions on basic freedoms. The West still buys oil from them. The so-called Islamic State is famous for its violations of human rights. But until recently, with the advance of the Iraqi army and more effective coalition airstrikes, Daesh was earning millions of dollars a day in smuggling oil at below-market-prices, selling it to tankers which would then cross the border into Turkey. So oil was and still is being bought from them. Venezuela has also committed some human rights violations as well, imprisoning journalists which have spoken up against the regime, killing political opponents, etc. Until very recently, with the near collapse of their oil infrastructure, the West bought huge amounts of oil from them as well. In general, people are willing to overlook human rights abuses if a country is willing to provide a cheap and dependable supply of a vital natural resource. Countries need petrol to fuel their cars, ships, military, etc. Democracies face electoral unrest if oil prices rise too high (even though it is preposterous to blame a national government for the movement of the global petrol market). Unfortunately, the human rights of people far away don't really matter that much when countries don't need to see or hear of them. 

Infested with what? Your city will be depopulated, but that simply means (from the perspective of the city) shedding off excess population. Places like Rome were never entirely abandoned. While the Eternal City's population fell to the tens of thousands in the early mediaeval era, it never became uninhabited. You'll have to also create a reason for why people won't use the technologies they find in this city and why its inhabitants won't use those technologies. The best explanation would probably have to do with those technologies requiring something not present in the new environment — coal for steam engines, brass to manufacture them, or an adequate market demanding automation. For military technology, it would probably have to do with the complex supply chains which underpin manufacturing. Where do you get the iron? Of what quality is that iron? How about the lead for musket balls? In what quantity? The paper for cartridges? Saltpetre for gunpowder? Of course, to create a narrative where those technologies are then employed requires you to establish a change of the situation that allows those technologies to be used. A Renaissance caused by the sudden appearance of the books and knowledge held in the city's libraries might consume this world, allowing for the development of the environment in which these technologies might be applied. 

1: Conflict may or may not have been started by the government. 2: Civilians may or may not have been placed into harms way by the government. 3: Barbarisms may or may not be present. To quote Orwell, "Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence". 

The function for money demand is the following, the equilibrium condition between the demand for real money and the liquidity preference function: $$\frac{M}{P} = \operatorname{lp} \left ( r^-, Y^+ \right )$$ Rearranging this to yield a function for the price level, or the variable of which inflation ($\small \pi$) measures long-run growth (i.e. $\small \pi_{t+1} = \frac{P_{t+1} - P_t}{P_t}$), yields: $$P = \frac{M}{\operatorname{lp} \left ( r^-, Y^+ \right )}$$ The price level is therefore dependent on three factors: 

The light given off by a blackbody spectrum at high temperatures like those found in stars, once you get above the temperature of the Sun's photosphere, which is around 5700 K, is going to be practically indistinguishable from white. The first thing I thought of when it comes to this is absorbing the light coming off from the star. But any amount of dust between the star and the planet would get blown away over the course of a few thousand years. I'm thinking you want something like this though. 

Devastation, naturally, reigned, as the entire town was basically hit by a weight of many million tonnes travelling around 40 miles per hour. Writ large, this sort of devastation isn't all that important — the environment outside those areas where the water hit, won't be all that affected. The rotation of the Earth has so much momentum that nothing much will happen to that. A tsunami is unlikely, as something a lot more forceful than this would have to move utterly enormous amounts of water (earthquakes are many orders of magnitude more powerful than dam failures). 

Mathematical note: I use the Keynesian theory of money here mostly due to its helpfulness in explaining issues with liquidity preference and the liquidity trap. However, similar conclusions can be derived from the more basic relationship used in classical economics $\small MV = PY$. This yields the following expression for $\small P$. $$ P = \frac{MV}{Y} $$ Thus, it is still clear that (1) increases in money supply affect prices at a positive proportional level $\small \frac{V}{Y}$, (2) increases in total output decrease the price level, and (3) increases in money velocity (V) lead to price growth, basically some measure of how frequently people change 

Having a longer orbital period of 800 days (assuming Earth days) and keeping a terrestrial climate will require you balance a number of variables. First, you have the generalised form of Kepler's law: $$p^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G M}$$ Where $p$ is the period, $r$ is the distance from the centre of gravity, $G$ is the gravitational constant, and to simplify from $M_1 + M_2$, I will use $M$ because planetary masses are negligible compared to stars. Basically, the period is itself dependant on the orbital radius. Then, I have the equation for extraterrestrial solar irradiance at different radii, holding the Earth value of 1367 $\textrm{Wm}^{-2}$ constant. $$1367 = \frac{L}{4 \pi r^2}$$ Where $L$ is the luminosity of the light source. This is what is important for keeping the climate terrestrial. Now, because I can relate luminosity to mass, I can then plug the following equation into this one. I assume a mass-luminosity relation with the general approximate value for low-mass main sequence stars of around 4: $$\frac{L}{L_{\odot}} = \left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{4}$$ This is where $L_{\odot}$ is the Sun's luminosity, $M_{\odot}$ is the Sun's mass, and $M$ is the mass of this hypothetical star. Substituting all of these equations together, starting with the solar radiation equation, then substituting the mass-luminosity relation for $L$ and then Kepler's law, solved for $r$, I get: $$1367 = \frac{\left(\frac{M}{M_{\odot}}\right)^{4} L_{\odot}}{4\pi \left(\sqrt[3]{\frac{p^2 G M}{4\pi ^2}}\right)^2}$$ I then set $p$ seconds to the appropriate value for your 800 day year and come up with some mass value $M$ necessary for that star. Using Wolfram Alpha (because I really don't want to solve that by hand), with this query, 

Money supply ($\small M$), as more money supply will lead to higher prices, something we can clearly see in the equation above. Output ($\small Y$), as higher output shifts the level at which prices fall given some constant money. Mathematically, we see this in that growing income leads to a larger denominator, and therefore, a lower price level. Real interest rates ($\small r$), as one must consider that the real determinant of inflation is really the demand for money, which is itself determined by the interest rate. Higher real interest rates would lead to lower real money demand, as people want to hold assets instead.
