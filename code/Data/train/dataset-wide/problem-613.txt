1. Copper The metal form of copper can be found in certain mineral veins. Finding a copper vein and playing with the "shiny pretty metal" was probably humanity's introduction to working with metals. From this early introduction metal tool making was discovered. 2. Bronze After discovering copper, metal smiths discovered that if you alloyed copper with another recently discovered metal, tin, you got a much tougher, durable, and hard metal called bronze. This was both the introduction of the Bronze Age, but also the discovery that we could change a material's property by changing its composition. 3. Iron Iron can (rarely) be found in its pure or alloyed metallic state. Iron as an ore is far more abundant than copper or tin. Discovering that if you heated certain rocks in combination with other rocks, you could get a new metal was a huge discover! Early iron was very soft (for pure alloys) or very brittle (which is what they got most of the time). In fact as a working metal, early irons were inferior to the bronze alloys of the era. However, iron was much more abundant. 4. Steel Steels came into being when certain smiths discovered that when you heated your iron with certain other rocks (limestone & coal) in certain proportions you got a much superior metal. Early steels were both harder and tougher than iron and bronze. It was probably these early steels that lead to the belief in magic swords. For example, high quality steel sword could literally destroy iron or bronze weapons. 

Just remember you'd have difficulty aiming more than one of these at a time. Although especially for the primitive ranged weapons, she could spend all of her thinking doing the aiming and then using her arms to bring the next weapon into the ready position - almost doubling her rate of fire. Melee: 

--from the Speculative Evolution link above So if terrestrial life is an indicator of life in general, we can expect the vast majority of alien intelligence to share these traits too. Carnivorous or Omnivorous social animals. An SF story may include solitary and/or herbivorous animals as exceptions to the standards. The animals I'll pick: 

All of the volcanic rocks and the ores that go with it. These are where we find precious metals. Some sedimentary rocks. Iron deposits were placed here by biological processes. You can conceivable find very high metallic concentrations at the bottom of some of the smaller craters. Meteorites that formed large craters are completely vaporized. 

In space, there's no hiding, cloak, stealth But the "clutter" on the Earth's surface provides plenty of hiding places. In space, heat is a big issue and the more powerful your weapons, the bigger the heat problem On the surface, the whole Earth acts like a giant heat sink - meaning surface dwellers can use much more powerful weapons since we have, practically speaking, an unlimited heat sink. In space, every gram counts so ships won't have any armor On the surface, Earth installations can be well protected or buried. An invading force only "has what they can bring with them" and over interstellar distances, that won't be very much The defenders have the all of the Earth and our tremendous industrial capacity to support war fighting. In space, your sensor are limited to the size of your vessels (this directly affects the resolution and accuracy of your targeting systems) As long as surface communications continue, we can integrate sensor data from all across the globe to get much more precise targeting data on the alien ships - we can see them MUCH better than they can see us 

Mental implants that provide data storage, wireless connectivity, mathematical calculation and other features are a possibility for the near future. Computers are fast Certain operations (data storage & retrieval and mathematical operations) computers can do very much faster than humans. In most cases, computers can solve the problems posed by humans faster than human minds can pose the tasks to the computers. Computers are literal Human language is often ambiguous. Human minds use many techniques to put conversations/requests into context and interpret what is being said. Often humans aren't capable of using a natural language to convey information to computers because of the ambiguity inherent in the human language. Computer languages Because we can't train computers to speak "human" we train humans to speak computers. Even with the fancy implants, Max will require extensive training in how to use and communicate with them on anything more than a rudimentary level. You might consider the language for communicate with the implants as a sort of scripting or programming language. As Max develops methods for getting what he wants from the implants by using this "scripting" language, Max will probably develop a sophisticated suite of self-made shortcuts. Compared to other humans who get the same implants as Max, only at a later date, Max will seem like a magician when he can use his already developed library of utilities to get what he wants. Human brain interface The suite of developed scripts will commonly act as a buffer between Max's mind and a direct connection to the internet. He can use his brain to select and queue up jobs to run. Those can be data acquisition, analysis, filtering, etc. He might not / probably won't monitor the processing in real time but will set up the job, get notified when it finishes, and then review the results. Remember the sum of information on the internet now is staggering so a big part of the scripts job will be to filter out the unwanted information and just get the information that Max needs to Max. Not so fantastic uses Unlike the hopeful image you've given (able to diagnose any disease), medicine is far less deterministic than you might think: 

Meaning if you live in a city that makes warships or jet engines, you'll be toast whether they get to the population centers or not. People living in rural areas do not need the population centers as much as the population centers need the rural areas (at least they don't need them as urgently). I imagine many of the rural survivors will do "ok" for several years. The problem of course is that generally speaking population centers also tend to be manufacturing centers. As things wear out, people in rural areas won't have the ability to replace their technological goods. People in population centers who survive will be the most likely to suffer and die. since the destruction of so much infrastructure will likely stop the transportation of essentials like food and water to them. People who live in areas which can't normally support large numbers people (such as Southern California & Arizona) will also be at tremendous risk. People in rural areas that are near such locations could also be at risk as the starving swarms of city dwellers spread out and attempt to get what they need. I generally guess that locations within a 3 day hike of a major city should expect casualties in excess of 50% due to starvation, exposure, and thirst (depending upon season, weather, and other factors). 

Partly what your colony needs will be determined based upon the specifics of what you mean by self-sufficient. Do you mean "economically" or do you mean "catastrophe strikes the Earth and the colony needs to survive on its own?" Basic Requirements Regardless of your definitions the initial requirements will be similar for either type (and those are very well defined by other answers). Basically figure out high mass needs, especially those that do not require special processing, and fill those needs first. As mentioned in other answers, these will start as things like: 

Fluence $^d$ to heat steel to melting point temperature $$\rightarrow F_{\text{heat sol}} = m \cdot c_{sp} \cdot \Delta T = 83 \cdot 0.5 \frac{J}{g \cdot 째C} \cdot 1390 째C = 57,626 J$$ Fluence to melt steel $$ \rightarrow F_{melt} = m \cdot \Delta H_{fus} = 83 g \cdot 277 \frac{J}{g} = 22,967 J$$ Fluence to heat steel to vaporization temperature $$\rightarrow F_{\text{heat liq}} = m \cdot c_{sp} \cdot \Delta T = 83 g \cdot 0.82 \frac{J}{g \cdot 째C} \cdot 1451 째C = 98,654 J$$ Fluence to vaporize steel $$ \rightarrow F_{vap} = m \cdot \Delta H_{vap} = 83 g \cdot 277 \frac{J}{g} = 22,138 J$$ Total Fluence to vaporize $$\rightarrow F_{Tot} = 57,626 J + 22,967 J + 98,654 J + 22,138 J = 201,386 J$$ 

Facility However, the facility would be very large and expensive. In order to not squishify your human passengers, the launcher barrel needs to be many MANY miles long. On my blog I limited the launcher to 3 g's of acceleration and discovered such a launcher requires a launch tube of 362 km about 225 miles! Note that a straight up "space gun" can't apply an even g load. The passengers would experience most of the g load up front and get squished. That's what makes the Ram Accelerator a much better technology for human passengers. Staging This technology also requires an apogee kick motor. Basically, it can put the hero on a ballistic course with its highest point in space. However, once you get there, you must apply some additional delta V to circularize the orbit or your projectile will crash back to Earth. Your projectile will survive the trip as a single stage or possibly 2 stages (if you plan to do external scramjet burning after leaving the end of the tube). 

Any half-life with a value of $\cdot 10^{98}$ is a liquid or solid at the conditions on the surface of that body. Meaning as long as it is surrounded by an atmosphere, there will be no loss of this compound (the reality is that airless bodies will still see some losses). The body Ceres is just outside the snow/frost line based upon my calculations. When I could find them I used melting & boiling points for 0.1 atmosphere pressures. When I couldn't find those I used those for 1.0 atmosphere. Tweaking the fudge factor is tricky. Tweak it too high and Mars gets too much atmosphere. Tweak it too low and Titan doesn't get enough. I think I found a happy compromise since Ganymede doesn't get any, Titan has one as long as there's some replenishment, and Mars lost most of its atmosphere. Red background means half-life < 100,000,000 years Yellow background means half-life < 4,500,000,000 years Green background means half-life > 4,500,000,000 years White background means substance isn't a gas at those conditions 

Physiological considerations aside, this is what I see as the differences: Slower Thinking / Decisions: Old people make decisions more slowly than young people. Research indicates this is not due to cognitive decline but instead old people must sift through a greater quantity of data (life experience). More Cautious: Older people tend to understand the likely risks and consequences of a given course of action better than young people. They would tend to wait longer before making decisions and try to gather more information before making the decision. More "In the Box" Thinking & Decisions: All people rely on analogous experiences to figure out how to approach new situations. Older people will have determined certain approaches work better than others in most cases and will reuse successful approaches. In most situations this will lead to quicker better solutions than a young person can devise. However, in novel situations in which people have no analogous experiences, this approach could trap them into solutions that don't work. More Conservative Thinking As a general rule, old people have more to lose (family, wealth, etc.) than young people. They also have a lot of prior experience on how to preserve things. This will lead to a more conservative approach for how to deal with new situations (how do I keep from losing those things precious to me). Young people would be much less likely to take this conservative approach. The Long View Very old people will be better able to take the long-view. They will have a greater understanding how their decisions and thinking might affect themselves and others over much longer periods of time. Also note that many people perfectly capable of doing this still won't. It's just that old age provides the framework which allows them to better understand these things if they choose to do so. 

One thing that will change is the collision of the two galaxies' gas and dust clouds. The collision will trigger massive and violent star forming areas. Some of these will form exceedingly large (e.g. $100 M_{\odot}$ - 100x the mass of the Sun). These stars burn hot, die quickly, and with a big bang (a Supernova). 

How about another twist before we go nuclear... Directed energy weapons. Directed energy weapons are very able to apply energy to a very focused source. The amount of energy they can deliver is pretty pitiful when compared with the energy of explosions but it still may be sufficient for your needs. 

A "Hypergolic" chemical is one that immediately ignites when in the presence of the correct other chemical. Liquid fueled rockets in space use hypergolic fuels, for example Nitrogen Tetraoxide (aka NTO or $NO_4$) & Monomethyl Hydrazine (aka MMH or $CH_3\left(NH\right)NH_2$). This ensures that the rocket engine will always ignite when it is needed. 

Yes and Yes Background The atmosphere changes properties with altitude. This change in properties is called the lapse rate. Atmosphere Lapse Rate 

Normally I think the word "Lunar" implies Earth's Moon (Luna) but I think we can control this through capitalization (capital Luna = Earth's moon, small luna = any moon). Assumptions: 

I'd use a $ \text{log}_5$ scale for atmospheric pressure. On this scale, 0 - vacuum 4.0 - Mars pressure 6.5 - min pressure for human survival 7.2 - Earth pressure 7.4 - Titan's pressure 9.6 - max pressure for human survival 10. - Venus' pressure Composition I'd probably just use a letter code to denote the primary constituent gases and percentages. For ease of use, assume any atmosphere with Hydrogen will have a proportional amount of Helium - so you can omit the Helium content. Then you could also include a note about the qualitative nature of the atmosphere (reducing, oxidizing, corrosive, toxic, etc.). Humans could survive some atmospheres without spacesuit like protection, but we can assume that corrosive and toxic atmosphere require some sort of special protection. Although our skin might handle reducing atmospheres (like hydrogen and methane), we'd need to be very careful with our breathing oxygen lest we turn our breathers into flame throwers. It's trickier with gases like $CO_2 + CO$ our bodies can handle certain quantities of both but too much is toxic. In the case of $CO_2$ too little of the gas is bad too. For any other world builders out there, I highly recommend reading what Winchell Chung put together on Atomic Rockets
