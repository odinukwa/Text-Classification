This isn't an answer its a conjecture. Nice question. Suppose that $M, N$ are a Riemannian manifolds and $M\subset N$ is an open subset and $N$ is complete. Lets assume that $M$ is path connected, so that there is no funny business in defining the distance between $p, q \in M$ to be the infimum of the length of a path joining $p$ to $q$. Also lets assume that that path metric is bounded, so you don't have infinite ends. There is a map from the metric space completion of $M$ into $N$ and its image will be the closure of $M$ in $N$. There is now a plethora of obstructions to the embedding, derived from this map. For instance: Let $CI(\overline{M})$ be those continuous functions on the metric space completion of $M$ whose restriction to $M$ is smooth. Let $I$ be the ideal of all functions in $CI(\overline{M})$ that vanish at a point $p$ of the completion. It should be the case that $T=(I/I^2)^*$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ where $n$ is the dimension of the manifold. Next, the metric tensor should extend to the completion, where you interpret it a point at infinity as a tensor on $T$, and its coefficients should be elements of $CI(\overline{M})$. Next you should be able to extend the Riemann curvature tensor appropriately as a map from the tensor square of T to itself, and the coefficients of the extension should also be in $CI(\overline{M})$ and they should satisfy all the restrictions on the tensor that the Riemann curvature tensor of a smooth manifold satisfies. Here is my conjecture : The condition above is necessary and sufficient. The reason is you should be able to build a candidate piece of the manifold $N$ with normal coordinates, and those normal coordinate patches should glue together coherently. 

In Raynaud's paper "Specialisation du foncteur de Picard", Theorem 3.3.1 says that algebraic group spaces, which are locally of finite type and separated over any locally noetherian normal 1-dim scheme, are group schemes. On the other hand, relative Picard functors for proper flat finite presentation schemes $f:X\rightarrow S$ over DVR such that $f$ is cohomologically flat are represented by algebraic sapces, but are often not schemes, see also that paper or the book Neron Model. 

Is there anyone familiar with this paper? It seems to me it contains "some" typos and even some small elementary mistakes, which makes my reading very slow. Of course the key reason for my slow reading is I wasn't familiar with Faltings and Chai's book, from which the paper use the notations and results. Maybe I have some (or many) misunderstanding. I hope someone could help me clear up my confusions: 

There is a simple answer to your first question. Imagine two circles of the same radius lying in parallel planes so that the segment joining their centers is perpendicular to the planes. There are two minimal surfaces that bound this configuration. One consists of two disks, one in each plane, and the other is a section of a catenoid. By playing around with the radii and distance you can even have two least area surfaces with the same boundary. Clearly there is not a unique minimal surface spanning the same piecewise linear curve. You could build a curve that bounded both a minimal disc and minimal Moebius band with little difficulty. I read this in a paper in German that was written in the 50's. I can't remember the author. I think you can find the example in Blaine Lawson's book on minimal surfaces. Also, Peter Hall gave some examples of nonuniqueness in the late 1980's. There is a Memoir of the AMS written by Dave Hoffman that constructs lots of families of minimal surfaces, using the Weierstrass representation, and counts of dimensions of holomorphic sections of line bundles to build lots of families. 

In Lemma 1.8, "the equation that cut out the cone at the vertex $(c,A(c))$ are $$x_0-A(c)\geq dA(\alpha(\sigma))(x)"$$ should the equations be $$"x_0-A(c)\geq dA(\alpha(\sigma))(x-c)" ????$$ "then the interior normal in the dual space $X^{\ast}_{\mathbb{R}}\oplus\mathbb{R}$ to the corresponding facet is $(1,-dA(\alpha(\sigma)))$", should this be "$(-dA(\alpha(\sigma)),1)$"??? In the same page, "Definition 1.10 We will denote the minimum of the functions $dA\alpha((\sigma))(x)$ in the above lemma by $\eta(x,c)$." Should we define $\eta(x,c)$ to be the maximum of the fuctions $dA\alpha((\sigma))(x)$???? 

How far is it to extend the results of SGA III Exp. VIB from group schemes to group spaces? In particular, does Corollary 4.4 from SGA III Exp. VIB hold for G/S being merely a group space? Here the base $S$ is still a scheme. Is there any reference for group spaces? I checked stack project, but the section 'properties of group algebraic spaces' from Chapter "groupoids in alg. sp." is less than 1 page. Raynaud's IHES paper contains a few pages. To be more precise, I would like to know if the following is ture: Let $G/S$ be group space locally of finite presentation with $S$ a trait (to make it easier), let $s,t$ be the closed point and generic point of $S$ respectively. Suppose $G_s$ and $G_t$ are smooth over $k(s)$ and $k(t)$ respectively, and $\mathrm{dim}G_s=\mathrm{dim}G_t$. Then the functor $G^0$ (defined as in SGA III Exp. VI B Def. 3.1) is represented by a smooth group scheme over $S$. 

Yes. There are a lot of ways to approach this. Following Roseman, you can take a generic projection of the torus into R^3, with overcrossing and undercrossing data. It will have double points, triple points and branched points. There is a presentation of the fundamental group of the complement of the torus using meridians around each facet of the immersed surface with Wirtinger type relators of from the double curves. If you can show it it isn't the fundamental group of the complement of the standard torus you are in. Roseman also developed Reidemeister like moves for these. Also the number of triple points can be used to detect knottedness. An alternative approach is due to Carter and Saito, it involves looking at slices of the knots as a family of R^3's moves through R^4 to give a movie of a link progressing in space with Morse type singularities. There are movie moves similar to the Reidemeister moves. From these you can attempt TQFT type invariants of the knotted surface to detect knottedness. There is also a theory of braids in 4 dimensions due to Kamada. However, there are more subtle invariants of knottedness than the fundamental group. You can start looking at characteristic classes of the normal bundle for instance. 

Is an algebraic space over a DVR, whose special fibre (and all its infinitesimal neighborhood) and generic fibre are schemes, actually a scheme? 

It is said so in Knutson's book 'algebraic sapces' in several places for different topologies on schemes, see Chapt. I, 2.19 for Zariski top, 3.13 for flat top., 4.11 for etale topology. But this seems to be clearly wrong to me. For example, let $f$ be the identity from $P^1$ to itself which is clearly surjective, consider the Zariski open covering $A^1\cup A^1\rightarrow X=P^1$, then $A^1\rightarrow X$ is not surjective. 

I am interested in the following example! Let $k$ be a field, let $X_0$ be the scheme $\mathrm{Spec}R$ with $R_0=k[x,y]/(xy)$, let $R$ be the strict Hensilian localalisation of $R_0$ at the origin and $X=\mathrm{Spec}R$, we define a sheaf $F$ on $X$ by $F(U)=\mathbb{Z}^2$ or $\mathbb{Z}$ for $U$ open in $X$ depending on if $U$ contains the origin or not (hence the stalk of $F$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$ at the origin, and $\mathbb{Z}$ at other points). The restriction maps for defining $F$ are given by $\mathbb{Z}^2\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}:(m,n)\mapsto m+n$ (in fact the sheaf comes from the log structure associated to the embedding $X_0\subset \mathbb{A}^2$ ). Since $X$ is strict Hensilian, we have $H^1(X,F)=0$. Now consider the projection $p:\mathbb{G}_{m,R}\rightarrow X=\mathrm{Spec}R$. What would be the group $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},p^*F)$? Maybe an easier version, is $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m,R},\mathbb{Z})$ zero? We do know $H^1(\mathbb{G}_{m},\mathbb{Z})=H^1(\mathrm{Spec}R,\mathbb{Z})=0$! 

The old answer is that the trace identity you give in 2) is not quite right, Let $R=\sum_i a_i\otimes b_i$ be the $R$ matrix for $U_q(sl_2)$ and let $t$ be the $4$th root of $q$, then $$t tr(XY)+ t^{-1}tr(S(X)Y)=\sum_itr(a_iX)tr(b_iY),$$ where $S$ is the antipode and $tr$ is the ordinary trace in the fundamental representation of $U_q(sl_2)$. That discovery really cost me, as I spent a long time trying to find the identity using the quantum trace, and it wasn't true. The appearence of the $R$-matrix on the right hand side of the equation is because diagrammatically, that is where the crossing is. You can find it in a paper of Bullock, Frohman and Bartoszynska in Communications in Mathematical Physics in the late 90's where we proved that the space of observables for $U_q(sl_2)$ lattice gauge field theory based on a fat graph is the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the surface which is a regular neighborhood of your graph. The skeins are functions on the space of connections on the lattice. We based our construction of lattice gauge field theory in the work of Alexeev, Schomerus and Grosse. Also we were inspired somewhat by the work of Buffenoir and Roche on lattice gauge field theory. In both their approaches, the algebra of observables were defined via generators and relations. They used a Wick ordering to get functions. We saw that the connections were actually a coalgebra, and the dual product on the observables satisfied the relators given by the authors in the physical literature. This allowed us to give a coordinate free construction of lattice gauge field theory based on a quantum group, that led to structural control over the algebra of observables. Falling back on an observation of Fock we were able to show that the algebra of observables quantizes the characters of the underlying surface group with respect to a Poisson structure constructed by Goldman. To get the signs to work like you want you need to work with $-tr$. The minus sign has been explained nicely by Bonahon and Wong. It comes from the fact that you are looking at $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$ representations and lifting them to to $SL_{2}(\mathbb{C})$ representations. Our ultimate step in this direction was "The Yang-Mills measure in the Kauffman bracket skein module". The lattice models were equipped with a "path" integral which is a trace on the algebra of observables that is topologically invariant. Once we had identified the algebra of observables as the Kauffman bracket skein algebra, we carried the path integral over to the purely topological picture to get a trace which deforms either integration against Haar measure in the case where the surface has boundary, or integration against the symplectic measure if the surface is closed. Although the physicists treated the path integral as a formal power series, we were able to show that as long as Planck's constant does not lie on the unit circle, or if it does, it is a root of unity, that the integral actually converges. In more modern terms, quantum Teichm\"{u}ller theory as developed by Fock, Checkov, Bonahon and Kashaev, constructs a dual lattice gauge field theory, whose representation theory has been worked out by Bonahon and his collaborators. What is nice about this is you can emulate steps of the proof of the geometrization conjecture in the quantum setting and find fixed representations. Bonahon and Wong recently proved that the space of observables contains a large subalgebra which is the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of the underlying surface. The shortcoming of all of this is that it doesn't address characters of closed surfaces. Generally the way you deal with that is by defining a projector. Ultimately more geometric approaches via a line bundle over the character variety will probably give more satisfactory answers in that case. The quantum hyperbolic invariants of Baseilhac and Bennedetti end up assigning quantum invariants to knots and links in manifolds with a $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$ representation. When the underlying representation is trivial these are the invariants of Kashaev which is have been equated with evaluations of the colored Jones polynomial by Murakami and Murakami. Some citations.

Let $f:X\rightarrow Y$ be a proper surjective morphism over some base scheme $S$ of finite type, suppose $f$ restricts to an isomorphism over some open $U$ of $X$, we also suppose both $X$ and $Y$ are integral for simplicity. I guess now $f$ is a covering for the cdh-topology. Now is there anyway to get an injection $$0\rightarrow \mathrm{Pic}^{\tau}_{Y/S}\rightarrow \mathrm{Pic}^{\tau}_{X/S}$$. By the way is $\mathbb{G}_m$ a sheaf for the cdh-topology? Could anyone give me a good reference for cdh topology treated in a general way instead serving only for motivic cohomology? 

should be not true! What is the cokernel of the map $\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow A$ with $A$ an abelian variety and $\mathbb{Z}$ the constant group scheme represented by the ring of integers? But if you consider only commutative algebraic group scheme over a field $k$(i.e. of finite type over $k$), then it should be abelian. 

In the beginning of $SO(3)$-TQFT (Communications in Geometry and Analysis) by F and Kania-Bartoszynska we construct a pairing with respect to which the $R$-matrix for $U_q(sl_2)$ is unitary. The trick is to use pairings on the representations that are not positive, but the induced pairing on intertwiners is. There is a later paper by Kirilov where he does the same thing in a much more general setting, but I forget the citation. My take-away from struggling to construct TQFT with corners that is Hermitian is, it's a mistake. TQFT as framed in low dimensional topology depends on linearity in an essential way. If some of your basic data is conjugate linear, it messes up the small level structure of the theory. As a kid who got sucked into mathematics by his desire to understand the quantum mechanics, the fact that TQFT is conceived with bilinear pairings messed me up, because, of course you take the complex conjugate when you are computing the bracket. 

Given a totally degenerated abelian variety $A_K$ (to make it easier) over a complete discrete valuation field $K$ with $R$, $\pi$ and $k$ the corresponding discrete valuation ring, uniformiser and residue field. Let $S=\mathrm{Spec}R$ and $S_n=\mathrm{Spec} R/(\pi)^{n+1}$. For any $S$-scheme $V$ we denote the scheme $V\times_S S_n$ as $V_n$. In particular, $A_K$ has semistable reduction, $A_K$ extends to a semiabelian scheme $G$ over $S=\mathrm{Spec} R$, and the corresponding Raynaud extension is just a torus $T$ over $S$, analytically $A_K=T_K/Y_K$, and we have a pairing $Y_K\times X_K\rightarrow \mathbb{G}_{m,K}$, where $Y_K$ is the periods lattice and $X$ is the character group of $T$. Moreover, we assume both $X$ and $Y$ (the character group of the Raynaud extension associated to the dual abelian variety $A_K^{\vee}$ which gives $Y_K$) are free $\mathbb{Z}$-modules. Starting from this, we can construction lots of projective models of $A_K$ by using Mumford's construction, see Mumford compositio 1972, Faltings-Chai's book, the 1999 Tohoku paper of Aleexev and Nakamura. Given a nice (being nice see [Mum1973]section 6) $Y_K$-invariant polyhedral decomposition $\Sigma$ of the affine space $E=\mathrm{Hom}(X,\mathbb{Q})$, we can construct a projective model $P_{\Sigma}$ of $A_K$ and cut out the semiabelian scheme $G$ from $P_{\Sigma}$. Over $S_n$ we have group action $G_n\times_{S_n} P_{\Sigma,n}\rightarrow P_{\Sigma,n}$. Now the question is: could we have an action of $G$ on $P_{\Sigma}$ which extends the group operation on $G$ and the actions on the infinitesimal fibres? It seems to me in Aleexev's 2002 Annals paper, the answer is yes, at least for certain canonical models obtained from a given theta divisor of some ample line bundle (since $A_K$ extends to a stable semiabelic scheme over $S$ once you are given a ample line bundle on $A_K$, and being a stable semiabelic scheme implies you have an action on the model, see Theorem 5.7.1 case 2 in that paper), but I couldn't find a concrete argument for this in the paper. Could anyone help me point out where the hidden argument is? Or give me some other reference. I know in dimension $1$ case, the paper by Deligne and Rapoport describes this action in order to define generalised elliptic curves via a different approach (using $\mathrm{Pic}^0$), but seems not easy to generalise to hight dimensional case.
