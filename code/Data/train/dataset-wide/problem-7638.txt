If one replaces $2^\Omega$ in FCU with an arbitrary boolean algebra, then FCU becomes equivalent to BPI, and FCP comes to imply HB. 

No. You can even suppose the variables are all identically distributed, bounded and the covariances are all zero, and you still won't have convergence to a normal distribution. To see this, take my main example $(X_n)$ from here (for any fixed $N>1$), arrange it into a triangular array by letting $Y_{n,k} = X_k$, and then let $X_{n,k} = Y_{n,\pi_n(k)}$ where $\pi_n$ is a random permutation (with all permutations equally likely) of $1,...,n$. Since $Y_{n,1},...,Y_{n,n}$ is $N$-tuplewise independent, the variables in the randomly permuted row will still have zero covariance. And since the $(X_n)$ don't satisfy the CLT, neither will the $(X_{n,k})$. 

What is the argument by which you know this fact? The standard argument I know is — roughly stated — as follows: 

Any non-discrete totally disconnected space gives a counterexample, e.g. the Cantor space $2^{\mathbb{N}}$. If a space $X$ is totally disconnected, then every simplex in it is constant (since the simplices are connected). So the singular set of $X$ is the discrete simplicial set on its points $|X|$; hence its geometric realisation is the discrete space on its points. Converting this explicitly to a counterexample to fullness: consider the identity map $|X| \to X$, where $X$ is totally disconnected and non-discrete. Then the induced map of singular sets is an isomorphism; but its inverse doesn’t come from any continuous map $X \to |X|$. 

Question: Can every probability space $(X,\scr F,\mu)$ be $\sigma$-embedded in the completion of the space $[0,1]^K$ (equipped with a product of Lebesgue measure) for some set $K$? Here, $f:\scr F\to \scr G$ is a $\sigma$-embedding of the measure space $(X,\scr F,\mu)$ into $(Y,\scr G,\nu)$ iff $f$ is one-to-one, and preserves measure, complements and countable unions. Here's what I have so far: Maharam's Theorem implies the measure (or probability) algebra of $X$ is $\sigma$-isomorphic to the measure (or probability) algebra of a disjoint union of countably many copies of $[0,1]^{K_n}$ (if $X$ has atoms, some of the $K_n$ will be empty), and of course the disjoint union $\sigma$-embeds in the measure algebra of $[0,1]^K$ for large enough $K$. Combining this with a lifting, we get a map from $\scr F$ to ${\scr L}^K$, the measurable sets of the completion of $[0,1]^K$, that preserves measure, complements and finite unions and is almost one-to-one (i.e., $f(A)=f(B)$ implies $\mu(A\Delta B)=0$). We can make the embedding be one-to-one by ensuring $K$ is large enough that there is a null subset $N$ of $[0,1]^K$ of the same cardinality as $X$ and replacing our almost one-to-one map $f:{\scr F}\to{\scr L}^K$ with $g(A)=(f(A)\backslash N)\cup h[A]$, where $h$ is a bijection between $X$ and $N$. Then $g$ will be an embedding into the completion of $[0,1]^K$. But I want a $\sigma$-embedding. 

It is not possible in the case $\mathcal{E} = \mathbf{sSets}$, $\mathcal{I} = (\cdot \to \cdot)$. To see this, note that since $\mathcal{I}$ is both an inverse and a direct category, the projective cofibrations (resp. injective fibrations) are exactly the Reedy cofibrations (resp. fibrations). So your condition would imply that any commutative square $\newcommand{\ra}[1]{\kern-1.5ex\xrightarrow{\ \ #1\ \ }\phantom{}\kern-1.5ex} \newcommand{\ras}[1]{\kern-1.5ex\xrightarrow{\ \ \smash{#1}\ \ }\phantom{}\kern-1.5ex} \newcommand{\da}[1]{\bigg\downarrow\raise.5ex\rlap{\scriptstyle#1}}$ $$ \begin{array}{c} A & \ra{h} & C \\ \da{f} & & \da{g} \\ B & \ra{k} & D \end{array} $$ factors as $$ \begin{array}{c} A & \ra{h_1} & A' & \ra{h_2} & C \\ \da{f} & & \da{f'} & & \da{g} \\ B & \ra{k_1} & B' & \ra{k_2} & D \end{array} $$ with the left square a trivial Reedy cofibration, and the right square a Reedy fibration. In particular, if $f$ is a cofibration and $g$ a fibration, then $f'$ must be both a cofibration and a fibration; so (in $\mathbf{sSets}$) it must just be an inclusion of connected components, and in particular must induce isomorphisms on $\pi_k$ for $k > 0$. But $f'$ is weakly equivalent to $f$, so if $f$ acts non-trivially on some $\pi_k$, $k > 0$, this is impossible. For instance, take $A = C = D = 1$, and $B = S^1$; then such a factorisation is impossible. 

Given a field $F$ of subsets of $\Omega$, we can define full conditional probabilities to be a function $P:F\times (F-\{ \varnothing \}) \to [0,1]$ such that: 

Here is a partial answer. The answer to the main question is negative given the continuum hypothesis (or more generally the non-existence of a real valued measurable cardinal less than or equal to $\mathfrak c$). An extension $\mu$ of $P$ to all sets with property $H$ (even without any invariance properties) gives rise to an atomless probability measure $\nu$ on all subsets of $2^\omega$, the existence of which was shown to contradict the CH by Banach and Kuratowski. Here's how we get $\nu$. Given any subset $A$ of $2^\omega$, let $A^* = (\{ 0 \} \times A) \cup (\{ 1 \}\times (2^\omega\backslash A))$. This has property $H$. Thus, $\{ 0 \} \times A = A^* \cap (\{ 0 \} \times 2^\omega)$ is $\mu$-measurable, and so we can define $\nu(A) = 2\mu(A \cap (\{ 0 \} \times 2^\omega))$, which will be a probability measure on $\mathcal P {2^\omega}$, and it will be atomless because $P$ is. (This uses Alex Kruckman's simple construction of sets satisfying $H$.) Given ZFC alone, one can give a negative answer to one of my follow-ups. Specifically, there is no extension of the product measure to all sets with property $H$ that is invariant under permutations of $\omega$, even if we just ask for finite additivity in the extension. For if $\mu$ is a finitely additive extension of $P$ to all sets with $H$, then $\nu$ (defined as above) will be a finitely additive probability measure on $\mathcal P {2^\omega}$ invariant under permutations. A contradiction follows from the fact that $F_2$ is a subgroup of $S_\omega$. More precisely: Let $\langle Q_n \rangle_{n\in\omega}$ be a partition of $\omega$ into countably infinite subsets. Let $\phi_n$ be a bijection of $\omega$ with $Q_n$, and let $X$ be the subset of $2^\omega$ consisting of functions $f:\omega\to \{0,1\}$ such that $f\circ \phi_n \ne f\circ \phi_m$ if $n\ne m$. Then $P(X)=1$ (the probability of a repeat in a countable sequence of uniform i.i.d. random variables is zero). Now for any permutation $\pi$ of $\omega$, let $\pi^*$ be the permutation such that $\pi^*(\phi_n(m))=\pi^*(\phi_{\pi(n)}(m))$ for all $n$ and $m$. Note that $\pi^*[X]=X$. The permutations of the form $\pi^*$ form a subgroup $G$ of $S_\omega$ isomorphic to the full group, and $G$ has no non-trivial fixed points on $X$. Since $S_\omega$ contains a free group of rank 2, there is no finitely additive $G$-invariant probability measure on $X$ (here we use AC), which contradicts the fact that $\nu$ is such a measure. I still don't know: Can one prove a negative answer to the main question in ZFC alone? Can one prove a negative answer to the main question with $\rho_n$-invariance in ZFC alone? 

At least in most traditional presentations, I think it’s defined as the latter, but some people here also seem to be using the former. The answer to this question depends on which we take. If we take the “a function is just a class” definition, then as suggested in the original question, and as stated in François’ answer, we definitely have some big problems without replacement: Set is no longer complete and co-complete, etc. (nor are the various important categories we construct from it); we can’t easily form categories of presheaves; and so on. Under this approach, we certainly get crippling problems in the absence of replacement. On the other hand, if we take the “a function must be a set” definition, we get some different problems (as pointed out in Carl Mummert’s comments), but it’s not so clear whether they’re big problems or not. We now can form limits of set-indexed families of sets; presheaf categories work how we’d hope; and so on. The problem now is that we can’t form all the set-indexed families we might expect: for instance, we if we’ve got some construction $F$ acting on a class (precisely: if $F$ is a function-class), we can’t generally form the set-indexed family $\langle F^n(X)\ |\ n \in \mathbb{N} \rangle$. This is why we still can’t form something like $\bigcup_n \mathcal{P}^n(X)$, or $\aleph_\omega$. On the other hand, such examples don’t seem to come up (much, or at all?) outside set theory and logics themselves! Most mathematical constructions that do seem to be of this form — e.g. free monoids $F(X) = \sum_n X^n$, and so on — can in fact be done without replacement, one way or another. Now… I seem to remember having been shown an example that was definitely “core maths” where replacement was needed; but I can’t now remember it! So if we take this approach, then we certainly still lose something; but now it’s less clear quite how much we really needed what we lost. (This approach is very close to the question “What maths can be developed over an arbitrary elementary topos?”.) 

Suppose $G$ is a group acting on $\Omega$ and $F$ is $G$-invariant. Then there are two natural ways of defining $G$-invariance for $P$. Strong $G$-invariance is defined by $P(gA|B)=P(A|B)$ whenever $g\in G$ and $A\cup gA \subseteq B$. Weak $G$-invariance is defined by $P(gA|gB)=P(A|B)$ for all $A,B,g$. It's not hard to prove that strong $G$-invariance implies weak $G$-invariance. (The easiest way for me is to go through exchange rates. More on those in a sec.) Main question: Does weak $G$-invariance imply strong $G$-invariance? Armstrong in Prop. 1.3 in his paper in this volume advertises a positive answer, but as far as I can see--though maybe someone can show me otherwise--the proof offered just plain doesn't work. (It only shows that if $P$ is weakly $G$-invariant, then the associated exchange rate $r(A,B)=P(A|A\cup B)/P(B|A\cup B)$ (where $1/0=\infty$ and $1/\infty=0$) satisfies $r(gA,gB)=r(A,B)$. But what we need to show is that $r(gA,A)=1$.) The answer is positive in the special case where $G$ is generated by elements of finite order. (It's easiest to work with the associated exchange rate $r$. This satisfies $r(A,B)r(B,C)=r(A,C)$ whenever the left-side is defined. Then weak and strong invariance for $P$ are equivalent to the universal conditions $r(A,B)=r(gA,gB)$ and $1=r(gA,A)$, respectively. If $g^n=e$ then $1=r(A,A)=r(A,gA)r(gA,g^2 A)\dots r(g^{n-1}A,g^n A)$ if the rhs is defined, and by weak invariance all the factors are equal and hence must all equal $1$.) So there won't be any counterexamples for finite $\Omega$. Here are two cases I've thought a fair amount about that might lead to a counterexample, but I haven't succeeding in getting a counterexample. The cases are of independent interest to me. Case 1: Let $\Omega = \{0,1\}^{\mathbb Z}$ and let $F$ be usual product $\sigma$-field. Let $\mathbb Z$ act (additively) on $\Omega$ by shifting the sequences: $(x+\omega)(y) = \omega(y-x)$. Let $H_n = \{ \omega : \forall k\ge n(\omega(k)=1) \}$. It's easy to see that there is no strongly $\mathbb Z$-invariant full conditional probability $P$ on $F$ such that $P(H_n | H_{n+1}) < 1$. But is there a weakly $\mathbb Z$-invariant one? A positive answer implies a negative answer to my main question. (If in addition to shift-invariance we require reflection invariance, then we have a group that's generated by element of finite order and so there is neither a weak nor a strongly invariant $P$.) Case 2: Let $\Omega = \mathbb R^2$ and let $F$ be all subsets. If $G$ is all rigid motions (combinations of translations and rotations), there is no strongly $G$-invariant $P$ because of the Sierpinski-Mazurkiewicz paradox. Is there a weakly $G$-invariant $P$? Again, a positive answer implies a negative answer to the main question. (Again, if we replace $G$ with all isometries, the answer is negative, because all isometries are generated by reflections.)
