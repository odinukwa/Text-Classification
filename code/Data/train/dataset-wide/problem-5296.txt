It appears that the debate on God is rooted in theistic definitions of words. To have implicit belief in God, the language we speak has to be theistic; theism appears to dictate diction. theism itself appears to be a linguistical phenomena; atheists trying to disprove God fall into the trap of believing that something that doesn't exist needs to be disproven. There is a theist privilege in language and logic as well. That's why weak atheism appears to be an accommodationist view to keep theism in the privileged position of power. Logic dictates semantics; logic bred theistic epistemic ideas into head just implicitly affirming God's existence. this appears to create theistic notions in our syntaxes. Our children are linguistically and logically bred to have theistic notions without ever having to explicitly state a theist position. Atheists are just people unlearning epistemology of God. Their language, their logic has yet to unlearn semantic theism. When they debate, they accidentally affirm God's existence just making presuppositional theistic statements. It's revealing to know that logic has theistic suppositions; our lenses that reason are theistic lenses; logic deduces God's existence. intersectionality speaking, logic and theism have been bedfellows. Logicians are predominantly theistic; it appears logical theism has developed quite nicely that atheists are havin, to literally change our logical axioms such as God, as if God is an axiom, as if axiom is God. 

All the latest psychoanalytic theory has been pursuing a highly mathematized trajectory which has left me in the dust as a philosophy/psychology student (4 years of liberal arts college with no math or science prerequisites). What sort of math curriculum would one need to undertake to "keep up with the Joneses"? The Joneses being the French nonphilosophers and psychoanalysts. Can anyone recommend any books for learning said curriculum? 

Derrida is hard to sum up but can someone define his notion of "dissemination" or does anyone know a good passage where he defines it? I know that Derrida writes on dissemination and has an original theory of it but I haven't encountered it in the "majors," namely, Of Grammatology and Writing and Difference. I've been writing on the transmission of knowledge and the reproduction of subjectivity and looking at Kant's notion of genius, disciples and the preservation and transmission of artistic technique through education and I think Derrida's perspective would be useful. 

Henri Lefebvre wrote a book Dialectical Materialism to attempt to divorce DM from its vulgarization by Stalinists and official Communist party philosophers and develop it as a form of "logic." I consider this book to be a little too Hegelian and philosophically concerned for it to be in the tradition of Engels' Anti-Duhring and Dialectics of Nature. A more recent book I found, Dialectical Social Sciences in the Age of Complexity by Ian Trevor King, has acid art and a ying-yang on the cover and a photo of the author wearing beads on the back but it is a surprisingly good synopsis of DM and its relevance to the Social Sciences. Lukacs' History and Class Consciousness is a classic in literary analysis and philosophy. David Harvey is not explicitly a theorist of DM but he uses DM principles in his political economy and geography. I would also look at Slavoj Zizek, particularly The Indivisible Remainder, The Parallax View, and Less than Nothing: Hegel in the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism for his heterodox account, although be prepared for a fair amount of Hegelian and Lacanian introjections. (He also has an upcoming book Absolute Recoil: Towards A New Foundation Of Dialectical Materialism, which should be elucidating). The Evolution of Dialectical Materialism by J.A. Jordan is an older book but it traces the evolution of DM and its influences on French positivism and sociology via Compte and its philosophical revision through Lenin, Stalin, and Plekhanov. I found several recent articles on my university library's search engine: "Dialectical Materialism and Geography" by M. D. Day and J. M. Wagstaff which is a defense of DM as a "scientific method" that can be used in geography. "The Crisis in Physics: Dialectical Materialism and Quantum Theory" by Andrew Cross which traces the history of DM in the debates arising from of statistical quantum mechanics. "Dialectical Materialism and Nature: An Alternative to Economism and Deep Ecology" by Brett Clark and Richard York uses DM to critique the dominant theoretical paradigms in political ecology. "Common Prescriptions for Psychology Derived from Dialectical Materialism and Chaos Theory" by Albert R. Gilgen is by far the most interesting article I found, it is a reconstruction of a Soviet project to create a psychology that was "consonant" with Marxist-Leninism. The synopsis states: 

I'm pretty sure is answer c). b) does not groups cats and dogs. It says that either a cat or a dog is well trained so is a good pet. The way I read it is: Every dog or cat who is well trained is a good pet. 

A_ | B | A and B ___ __ __ ______ A_| B | A or B T_ | T |___ T__________________ T_ | T |__T T_ | F | ___F__________________ T_ | F |__T F_ | T | ___F__________________ F_ | T |__T F_ | F | ___F__________________ F_ | F |__F As you can see, when conjuncting A, B(A and B) is only true if both prepositions are true. When disjuncting A, B(A or B) is true if both are true or if one of them is true. So what can you interpret from the question? Every dog and cat who's well trained is a good pet. Do you think it needs to be both cat and dog for the sentence to become true or just one of them to sentence be true? The way I read it: a) For all xx, dog(true) or cat(true), good pets imply well trained. 

I'm reading The Principles of Non-Philosophy and re-reading Philosophy and Non-Philosophy by François Laruelle and I keep coming across this description of the philosophical decision described as a "fractional matrix in 2/3rd terms." For example he states in the first work: 

Most of the other books and articles on dialectical materialism are far older and are more concerned with its exposition and dissemination rather than original theorizing (I've actually found some old Soviet era logic textbooks which are fascinating but useless). 

Ross Wolf (see $URL$ states that it is a reference to Hegel's "henology" and describes it in the Fichtean terms of thesis-antithesis-synthesis: "The “3” side invariably refers to the transcendentally exterior “synthesis,” while the “2” refers to the immanently interior dualism of “thesis” and “antithesis” (to use crude Fichtean terms)." However, I still want to know that the significance of Laruelle's use of a fractional matrix is. Can anyone conceptualize this or define a "fractional matrix" in either layman's terms or "philo-speak"? 

After a quick search for skepticism it seems that the term is heavily peroidized, referring to the school of Pyrrhonism in the 1st BC its subsequent rediscovery in the 17th century. So it seems there aren't really any contemporary philosophical skeptics (although in some abstracts of papers on skepticism I found Marx and Derrida came up). Its possible the term has degraded since skepticism is usually supplemented with some sort of empiricism or realism and where it isn't it typically manifests as nihilism. I've become rather hesitant to define François Laruelle's non-philosophy since I don't want to misrepresent it but I will offer it here as the most contemporary thinking through of the implications of what you called Nietzsche's philosophical skepticism (although I would define Nietzsche's project more as an anti-philosophy). One of the basic gestures of non-philosophy is to critique the notion of thought's "sufficiency" to comprehend and conceptualize reality (the "Real"). Put in overly simplistic terms, it posits that the Real is foreclosed to thought and is thus unphilosophizable. The only way it becomes philosophizable or conceptualizable is if it is "decided" which is the inaugurating gesture of all systematic philosophies. I won't go on from there but you can see how it takes up the themes of certain skeptical philosophies. The most representative work is Philosophie Non-Standard which sadly remains untranslated but The Principles of Non-Philosophy was recently translated into English and is considered the most advanced presentation of Laruelle's thought. Deleuze and Guattari are also a good place to look for philosophers taking up the style and thematics of Nietzsche (although this can be said of most of the French theory that emerged in the late 60's) but are hardly as readable. If you are feeling more poetic, I would look into E.M. Cioran. In terms of a contemporary "rigorous" empirical skepticism, there is no one better than Wittgenstein. If you want to go back to the historical manifestations of skepticism with some contemporary commentary, Richard H. Popkin looks like a good place to start (though I haven't read him myself).
