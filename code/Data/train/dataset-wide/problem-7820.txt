One place to look might be random graphs $G(n,p)$. This might either give you a wide class of graphs for which an improvement holds, or else show you a limit to what you might hope for.

This seems obvious, but I can't seem to state a good reason why it's true. Does it follow from some well-known theorem? I would guess that we don't need convexity, and that something similar holds for smoothly embedded hypersurfaces in Euclidean space, and maybe one can relax "smooth" to class $C^2$? (*) My understanding is that "smoothly bounded convex body" means a compact, convex set, with nonempty interior, with a unique supporting hyperplane at each point. I am not sure how close this is to a convex image of a smooth embedding of a $d$-dimensional ball, but again, I expect that the statement probably holds in either case. 

Andrew Newman just posted a preprint to the arXiv showing that the answer is doubly exponential in $n$. In particular, he showed that the number of homotopy types of simplicial complexes on $n$ vertices is at least $$\exp \left( \exp \left( 0.004n \right) \right),$$ for all large enough $n$. This matches the upper bound from Dedekind numbers, up to the constant $0.004$. Newman's result depends on showing that this many different torsion subgroups are possible for homology in dimension $d$, where $d \approx \delta n$ for some small constant $\delta > 0$. The existence proof is partly constructive and partly depends on the probabilistic method. $URL$ 

For $\epsilon > 0$ sufficiently small, can a regular hexagon with sides of length $1 + \epsilon$ be covered by seven equilateral triangles with sides of length $1$? Motivation: Conway and Soifer showed that an equilateral triangle with sides $n + \epsilon$ can be covered with $n^2 + 2$ triangles. They conjectured that this is best possible, i.e. that it can not be covered by $n^2 + 1$ such triangles. This is fairly clear for $n=1$ and $n=2$ but the problem seems to be open even for $n=3$. The hexagon I've asked about is a substructure of the $n=3$ case that might be more tractable, but might still capture some of the difficulties of the $n=3$ and larger cases. 

$G_n$ has $n$ vertices, the number of edges of $G_n$ is $O(n)$, and the crossing number of $G_n$ is $\Omega(n)$?

Let $G(n,p)$ denote the Erdős–Rényi model of random graph. For a given function $p = p(n)$ we say that $G \in G(n,p)$ asymptotically almost surely has property $\mathcal{P}$ if $$\mbox{Pr}[G \mbox{ has property } \mathcal{P}] \to 1 $$ as $n \to \infty$. The property $\mathcal{P}$ I am interested in is the following: For every vertex $v$ there exist vertices $x, y$ such that $N(x) \cap N(y) = v$. (Here $N(x)$ denote the set of neighbors of $x$.) Note that this is not a monotone graph property. For random graphs it is fairly clear that $\mathcal{P}$ does not hold once $$p \ge \left( \frac{2 \log n + C \log \log n }{n} \right)^{1/2} ,$$ for some large enough constant $C>0$ for example, because at that point, every pair $x,y$ has large neighborhood intersection $N(x) \cap N(y)$. On the other hand, the property also does not hold for small $p$. In particular if $$p \le \frac{\log n - \omega}{n}$$ where $\omega \to \infty$, then $G(n,p)$ has isolated vertices $v$. My guess is that $\mathcal{P}$ a.a.s. holds for most of the way between the thresholds for the monotone properties "minimum-degree-$2$", at about $$p = \frac{\log n + \log \log n }{n}, $$ and "for every pair $x, y$, $N(x) \cap N(y) \neq 0$" given above. I am more interested in the upper threshold. So the question I would most like to hear the answer to is: 

One way to approach this question quantitatively is suggested by probability. One can put various measures on the space of all simplicial complexes on $n$ vertices. One perhaps fairly natural measure is to take a random graph and then take the clique complex. This doesn't give us all complexes on $n$ vertices but every complex is homeomorphic to the clique complex of some graph, so we are covering everything up to homeomorphism as $n \to \infty$. The main point of my paper Topology of random clique complexes is that almost all simplicial complexes arising this way are fairly simple topologically. In particular is shown that for a typical $d$-dimensional clique complex, the homology groups $H_k$ all vanish when $k > \lfloor d/2 \rfloor$ and when $k< d/4$, and that almost all of whatever homology remains is concentrated in the middle dimension $k=\lfloor d/2 \rfloor$. It is currently an open problem to decide whether the homology is vanishing (or merely small) between $k=d/4$ and $k=d/2$. If one could establish this, then one would be well on the way to showing that almost all flag complexes are homotopy to a wedge of spheres; indeed the last thing to do would be to rule out torsion in middle homology with integer coefficients. I don't have a good feel for whether either of these things is even true, but I do think that this paper gives good anecdotal evidence that most flag complexes are somewhat simple topologically, and is a step in the direction of answering Forman's question. (This particular measure seems especially natural from the point of view of combinatorics, since so many simplicial complexes arise as order complexes of posets, hence are automatically flag complexes.) UPDATE: (1) I showed recently that for every $k \ge 3$, there is a range of edge probability so that the random clique complex (also called random flag complex) is rationally homotopy equivalent to a wedge of $k$-dimensional spheres. In particular all the rational homology is in middle degree. There is only a very small overlap where there is homology in degree $k$ and in degree $k+1$, but in some sense, most of the time there is only homology in one degree. The conjecture that "rationally homotopy equivalent" can be replaced by "homotopy equivalent" is equivalent to showing that with high probability, homology is torsion free. (2) On the note of torsion in random homology, in joint work with Hoffman and Paquette, we recently showed that for a slightly different model of random simplicial complex, for most of the range where rational homology is vanishing, integer homology is also vanishing. There are one or two technical issues in applying the method of (2) in the setting of (1) (namely non-monotonicity of homology), but so far it seems like there is reason to believe that the method will go through eventually. Together, these two recent results suggest that a random flag complex (for a suitable range of edge probability $p$) is homotopy equivalent to wedges of $d$-dimensional spheres. Random flag complexes seem to me like a very natural model for addressing your question probabilistically, since so many complexes in combinatorics are flag complexes, arising as order complexes of posets, etc. 

Let $G(n,p)$ denote the Erdős–Rényi random graph, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $p$ is the probability for each edge. I'm interested in precisely what range of $p$ the random graph has at least one edge not contained in any triangle. One easily checks that if $$p \ge \left( \frac{2 \log n + \omega}{n} \right)^{1/2}, $$ where $\omega \to \infty$ arbitrarily slowly, then every pair of vertices is a.a.s. connected by a path of length $2$, so it follows that every edge is contained in a triangle. This can be sharpened though. Let $X$ denote the expected number of edges not in any triangle. Then $$E[X] = {n \choose 2} p (1-p^2)^{n-2},$$ and if I did my calculation correctly, then if $$p \ge \left( \frac{(3/2) \log n + (1/2) \log \log {n} + \omega}{n} \right)^{1/2}$$ then there are a.a.s. no edges not contained in any triangles, since $E[X] \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$. My guess is that this inequality is more-or-less sharp. What I'd like to show then is that if $p$ is much smaller, then there are a.a.s. edges not contained in any triangle. Suppose for example that $$p \ge \left( \frac{(3/2) \log n - C \log\log{n} }{n} \right)^{1/2}.$$ Is it true that for large enough constant $C>0$ we have a.a.s. that at least one edge not contained in any triangle? The expected number of such edges is tending to infinity as a power of $\log{n}$, but obviously that's not enough. I have tried using Janson's inequality, for example, but I am stuck because the events I am trying to count are not pairwise independent even though they are "almost independent."
