Consider a smooth $k$-dimensional foliation of the unit ball $B$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, all of whose leaves are diffeomorphic to $k$-disks. Question: Is there a leaf whose $k$-volume is at least $\omega_k$? Here $\omega_k$ denotes the volume of the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^k$. Particular cases. If $k=1$, the leaf through the origin (in this case a curve) has the desired property. If $k=n-1$, the leaf which divides the ball into two regions of equal volume has the desired property, by a relative isoperimetric inequality. A possible argument. Replace each leaf $F$ by a $k$-submanifold which minimizes the $k$-volume among those with boundary $F\cap \partial B$. Among the minimal submanifolds obtained in this way, consider one which passes through the origin: its $k$-volume is at least $\omega_k$ by the monotonicity formula, and the $k$-volume of the leaf with the same boundary is even larger. I know how to make this argument rigorous when the foliation is close enough to the foliation by parallel affine subspaces (but a reference or a more elementary proof also for this perturbative case would be very useful). In general, besides for possible singularities of the minimizers (which should not disturb), the problem I see is how to guarantee that at least one of them passes through the origin. 

More on the dynamical relevance of Lagrangian submanifolds for autonomous Hamiltonian systems: Any Lagrangian submanifold which is contained in a regular energy level is automatically invariant for the dynamics. When applied to Lagrangian graphs inside cotangent bundles, this observation leads to the stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation. 

Following Bernstein-Zelevinski, an $\ell$-space is a Hausdorff, locally compact totally disconnected topological space. For an $\ell$-space $X$, denote $S(X)$ the space of Bruhat-Schwartz functions on $X$, i.e., the space of $\mathbb{C}$-valued locally constant, compact supported functions on $X$. A distribution on $X$ is defined to be an element in $\textrm{Hom}_{\mathbb{C}}(S(X),\mathbb{C})$. Denote by $S^*(X)$ the space of distributions on $X$. Let $G$ be an $\ell$-group which acts on $X$. Then $G$ acts on $S(X)$ as $(g.f)(x)=f(g^{-1}.x),g\in G,f\in S(X), x\in X$. This induces an action of $G$ on the distributions: $(g.T)(f)=T(g^{-1}.f)$. A distribution $T$ is called $G$-invariant if $g.T=T$ for all $g\in G$. Denote by $S^*(X)^G$ the space of $G$-invariant distributions on $X$. Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field. $\textbf{Question 1}$: Let $G=F^\times \times F^\times$ and $X=F^3-\{(0,0,0)\}$. Let $U=(F^\times)^3$ which is an open subset of $X$. Let $G$ act on $X$ by $(a,b).(x,y,z)=(ax,by,abz)$. Is there a $G$-invariant distribution on $X$ such that its restriction to $U$ is non-trivial? If such $T$ exists, what can we say about $Supp(T|_U)$? $\textbf{Question 1'}$: Let $G,X,U$ be as in $\textbf{Question 1}$. Let $\mu=\psi(z/(xy))d^*xd^*yd^*z$, viewed as a distribution on $U$. Here $\psi$ is an additive character of $F$. Is there a $G$-invariant distribution $T$ on $X$ such that $T|_U=\mu$? Here is one example in my mind that suggests the non-existence of distributions $T$ in Question 1. Consider the multiplicative action of $F^\times$ on $F$, and let $U=F^\times$, which is an open subset of $F$. Then by Tate's thesis, there is no $F^\times$-invariant distribution $T$ on $F$ such that $T|_U$ is non-zero. In fact, the only $F^\times$-invariant distribution on $F$ is the Dirac measure. But if we consider the action $(a,b).(x,y,z)=(ax,by,a^{-1}b^{-1}z)$ in $\textbf{Question 1}$, there clearly exists $G$-invariant distribution on $X$ (even on $F^3$, say the usual Haar measure $dxdydz$ on $F^3$) such that its restriction to $U$ is non-trivial. Here are some thoughts on Question 1. Let $Z=X-U$. Then there is an exact sequence $$0\rightarrow S^*(Z)^G\rightarrow S^*(X)^G\rightarrow S^*(U)^G$$ Let's take an element $T_0\in S^*(U)^G$ and asks the question: is it possible to extend $T_0$ to a distribution on $X$? Given a function $\phi\in S(F)$, we can define a distribution $T_0$ on $U$ by $$<T_0,f>=\int_U f(x,y,z)\phi(z/(xy))d^*xd^*yd^*z, f\in S(U).$$ But it seems that there is no obvious way to extend $T_0$ to $X$. For example, if $f\in S(X)$, the integral $ \int_U f(x,y,z)\phi(z/(xy))d^*xd^*yd^*z$ is not well-defined in general, even when $\phi$ has compact support. But I don't know how to characterize $S^*(U)^G$ in general, and I also don't know how to show the above $T_0$ cannot be extended to a $G$-invariant distribution on $X$. Any thoughts or suggestions? Thanks in advance. I asked part of the question here $URL$ but did not draw much attention, and thus I decided to move it here. If it is not permitted, I will delete one. 

They are solving for $\gamma_G(w) = \# \{ t \in G^n : w(t)=1 \} $. For words that define surfaces they get a count in terms of the characters of $G$: $$ \gamma_G(w)= \big|G\big|^{n-1} \underbrace{\sum_{\rho \in \mathrm{Irr}(G)} (\dim \rho)^k \langle \rho|g\rangle}_{\zeta_G(-k)} $$ This formula appears in many places, e.g. arXiv:0905.0731:Topological Quantum Field Theories from Compact Lie Groups. They are using the fact the characters of a group form a TQFT. I don't really understand why people don't study group statistics using this type of result. You can generalize the bound $\gamma_G(aba^{-1}b^{-1})\leq 5/8$ easily. 

Then there are square-free numbers and $\{ n : n^2 + 1 \text{ is square-free} \}$. I have been looking through various sources... such as Roth's book who writes very abstractly. In a sense, chosen any correctly-chosen set can have positive upper density, but are there any good examples that you are aware of? Erdos may have come up with a few. I considered making my coin-flip example deterministic. 

Basically, I am trying to build explicit examples of Dirac operators. To this end, I'm looking at the surface E = C/(Z + λZ) - for some λ in H \ SL(2,Z) - with the Euclidean metric and the flat connection. The, since the torus has genus 1, there are 22=4 spin structures on the tangent bundle of this elliptic curve. What are the four ways do define representations of SU(2) Spin(2)=U(1) on TpE for each $p \in$ E? There is probably one spin structure for each element of the homology ring with coefficients in Z2. For reference: A spin structure on E is an open covering $\{ U_\alpha : \alpha \in A\}$ and transition functions $g_{\alpha\beta}: U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \to Spin(2) = U(1)$ satisfying a cocycle condition gαβgβγ=gαγ on $U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \cap U_\gamma$. Perhaps there are other definitions better for explicit computations. 

Let $k=\mathbb{F}_q$ where $q$ is a prime power of odd cardinality. Where could I find explicit models of all irreducible cuspidal (complex) representations of $GL_n(k)$ for $n\ge 3$? I understand that the characters of such representations was constructed by J.A. Green “The characters of the finite general linear groups,” Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.,80, No. 2, 402–447 (1955). If $n=2$, the cuspidal representations of $GL_2(k)$ can be constructed using Weil representations, which can be found in many online notes. But I could not find any explicit construction of cuspidal representations of $GL_n(k)$ when $n\ge 3$. 

I checked many answers but did not find this one. Probably I missed it. Let $G$ be reductive group over a p-adic field, $B$ be its Borel subgroup and $w_\ell$ be its long Weyl element. False belief: For a smooth compact supported function $f$ on $G$, then $f|_{B w_\ell B}$ is also smooth compact supported function on $B w_\ell B$. My advisor told me that this kind mistake is quite common for beginners. Here is another subtle false belief. Still let $F$ be a p-adic field and let $\mathfrak{p}$ be its prime. Consider the metaplectic double cover $$\widetilde {\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F)\rightarrow \textrm{Sp}_{2n}(F).$$ Here as a set $\widetilde {\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F) =\textrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)\times \{\pm 1\}$, and the multiplication in $\widetilde{\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F)$ is define by Rao cocycle $c=c_{Rao}$: $(g_1,\epsilon_1)(g_2,\epsilon_2)=(g_1g_2,\epsilon_1\epsilon_2 c(g_1,g_2))$. Let $K_m^n=(1+M_{n\times n}(\mathfrak{p}^n))\cap \textrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)$ be the standard congruence subgroup. False belief: The map from $K_m^n\rightarrow \widetilde {\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F),$ $k\mapsto (k,1)$ defines a group homomorphism if $m>>0$. This is false even when $n=2$ and I saw this statement in published papers. When $n=1$, this is correct. In general, the double cover $\widetilde {\textrm{Sp}}_{2n}(F)\rightarrow \textrm{Sp}_{2n}(F)$ splits over $K_m^n$ for $m$ large, but the naive map $k\mapsto (k,1)$ does not give the splitting for $n\ge 2$. 

In classical mechanics: If a Lagrangian L is preserved by an infinitesimal change in the state space variables qi -> qi + εKi(q) leads to only second order change in the Lagrangian: $$ 0 = \frac{dL}{d\epsilon} = \sum_i \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i}K_i + \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} \dot{K}_i \right) = \frac{d}{dt}\left(\sum_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i} K_i \right) $$ Then we get our conserved momentum because the rate of change on the right side is 0. In quantum mechanics, an observable A commuting with the Hamiltonian [H,A] = 0, corresponds to a symmetry of the time-independent Schrodinger equation Hψ = Eψ. How to we compute the conserved quantity related to A? In particular, what is the the conserved quantity associated with the identity operator? 

In two variables, $S = \{ xy = 1: x,y \in \mathbb{F}_q\}$ and then $P(x,y) = x^k - y^{(q-1)-k}$ is identically zero. We can check: $$ x^k - y^{(q-1)-k} = x^k - x^{k-(q-1)} = x^k - x^k = 0$$ for any $x \in \mathbb{F}_q$. The partial derivatives are $\partial_x P = k \,x^{k-1}$ and $\partial_yP = [(q-1)-k] \;y^{(q-2)-k}$ . That... disproves the converse. 

Have you considered using the matrix-tree theorem [2, 3] which counts spanning trees instead of domino tilings? 

One day I read a generating function in a paper. For any "sufficietly nice topological space", $C$: $$ \sum_{l \geq 0 } q^{2l}\chi(\mathrm{Sym}^l[C]) = (1 - q^2)^{-\chi(C)} = \sum_{l \geq 0} \binom{l + \chi(C)-1}{l} q^{2l} $$ First of all, I'm not sure what "sufficiently nice" means here. I'm guessing any CW complex will do. I wonder what's an example of a space where this formula doesn't work. 

Let $G$ be a reductive group defined over a field $F$. Let $\Sigma$ be the set of roots of $G$ with respect to a Borel subgroup $B=TU$ with torus $T$. Let $W=N_G(T)/T$ be the Weyl group of $G$. For $\alpha\in \Sigma$, let $U_\alpha$ be the root space of $\alpha$. Denote $x_\alpha:F\rightarrow U_\alpha$ the fixed isomorphism. Let $\alpha\in \Sigma$ be a root, and $w\in W$ be a Weyl element such that $w(\alpha)=\alpha$. My question is: is it true that $w$ has a representative $\dot w\in G$ such that $$\dot w x_\alpha(r)\dot w^{-1}=x_\alpha(r),\forall r\in F?$$ If this is false in general, in what cases it is true? Thanks in advance. 

In their paper "Uniqueness of linear periods", Compositio Mathematica, $\textbf{102}$ (1996), 65-123, Jacquet and Rallis asked the following question in the middle of page 67. Let $F$ be a $p$-adic field, and $n$ be a positive integer. Let $H_0=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}a&\\ &a \end{pmatrix},a\in GL_n(F)\right\}\subset GL_{2n}(F)$. Given an irreducible smooth representation of $GL_{2n}(F)$, if $\textrm{Hom}_{H_0}(\pi,1)\ne 0$, could we conclude that $\pi$ is self-contragredient? If $n=1$, it is well-known that the answer is yes. How about the general case? What is the current status of this problem? 

Let $E/F$ be a quadratic field extension of p-adic fields. Let $V$ be a (skew-)Hermitian space and $U(V)$ be the unitary group. Let $GU(V)$ be the similitude unitary group. Given an irreducible smooth representation $\pi$ of $GU(V)$, do we know that the restriction $\pi|_{U(V)}$ has multiplicity one? For the pair $(GL(n),SL(n))$ similar results are proved by Tadic. For the pair $(GSp, Sp)$, similar results are proved by Adler-Prasad. I am wondering if the unitary group version is true or not. Thanks. 

The diffeomorphisms which are generated by (time-dependent) Hamiltonian vector fields are said to be Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms form a subgroup of the group of symplectic diffeomorphisms (actually, they are a subgroup of the connected component of the identity). As you observe, locally they cannot be distinguished from symplectic diffeomorphisms. But they are a much smaller class. For instance, the Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{T}^2$ are exactly those symplectic (i.e. area-preserving) diffeomorphisms which have a lift $\varphi:\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ such that $\varphi(x) = x + \psi(x)$ where $\psi$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and satisfies $$ \int_{[0,1]^2} \psi(x) dx =0. $$ In particular, nontrivial translations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ are symplectic but not Hamiltonian (the latter fact is true also for $\mathbb{T}^{2n}$). As for your doubts related to local existence: if $M$ is a compact manifold you of course have global existence, but these definitions make sense also on non-compact manifolds. Indeed, the non-exactness of $\imath_X \omega$ can be detected on a compact subset $K$ of $M$ (a circle is enough) and you can find $\tau>0$ such that the flow of a neighborhood of $K$ exists up to time $\tau$. 

This is certainly true if you choose $\lambda$ to be strictly smaller than the smaller eigenvalue of $DX(0)$. You may prove it inductively, by noticing that for a given $y$ the function $t\mapsto D^{\alpha}_y \Phi_t(y)$ solves a linear equation. For instance, the first step goes as follows: the path of matrices $W(t):= D_y^{\alpha} \Phi_t(y)$ solves the ODE $$ W'(t) = DX(\Phi_t(y)) W(t), \quad W(0)=I, $$ where $\|DX(\Phi_t(y)) - DX(0)\| \leq C_0 e^{\lambda_0 t}$ for all $t\leq 0$. Then for every $\lambda_1<\lambda_0$ you can find $C_1$ such that $\|DX(\Phi_t(y))\| \leq C_1 e^{\lambda_1 t}$ for all $t\leq 0$. A useful lemma for proving this and getting the uniformity you need is the following: given a continuous bounded path of matrices $t\mapsto A(t)$, $t\geq 0$, denote by $W_A(t)$ the solution of the linear Cauchy problem $$ W_A'(t) = A(t) W_A(t), \quad W_A(0) = I. $$ Assume that $\|W_A(t)W_A(s)^{-1}\|\leq c e^{\lambda (t-s)}$ for every $t\geq s\geq 0$. Then for every continuous bounded path of matrices $t\mapsto H(t)$, $t\geq 0$, there holds $$ \| W_{A+H}(t)W_{A+H}(s)^{-1}\|\leq c e^{\mu (t-s)}, \quad \forall t\geq s\geq 0, $$ with $\mu := \lambda + c \|H\|_{\infty}$. (Sorry if here I switched to positive time, that's just because I am more used to work with stable manifolds). 

Let $F$ be a number field, and $S$ be a non-empty finite set of places of $F$. Suppose that for each $v\notin S$, we have a character $\chi_v$ of $F_v^\times$ (for my purpose, we can require that $\chi_v$ is quadratic). Moreover we suppose that $\chi_v$ is unramifiedd for almost all $v\notin S$. Is it possible to find a global Hecke character $\chi$ of $\textbf{A}_F^\times$ such that for all $v\notin S$, the local component of $\chi$ is exactly $\chi_v$? If $S$ has a single element $v_1$, I think this is possible by the following simple construction. For $a\in F^\times$, define $$\chi_{v_1}(a)=\prod_{v\ne v_1}\chi_v(a)^{-1},$$ and then extend $\chi_{v_1}$ to $F_{v_1}^\times$ by density. According the comments given by @znt this is false. Now my question is: is there any reasonable conditions on $\chi_v$ for $v\notin S$ such that this is true? If this is not suitable for this site, I will delete it. Any help will be appreciated. 

In section 10 of Gan-Gross-Prasad's paper "Symplectic local root numbers, central critical L-values, and restriction problems in the representation theory of classical groups" $URL$ the authors stated that the full local Langlands conjectures for some small ranked classical groups are known, but no reference is given. Can anybody point out a reference for the SO(4) and SO(6) case? Do we know whether the local Langlands map preserves certain local epsilon or L-factors? Added: I appreciated the answer provided by Professor Kimball, which is very helpful. I do want to know more details about (split) SO(4). In the last section of Gross-Prasad's paper as given by Kimball, there is an exact sequence $$0\rightarrow SO_4(k)\rightarrow GL_2(k)\times GL_2(k)/\Delta k^* \rightarrow k^* \rightarrow 0.$$ To get the local Langlands conjecture for SO(4) from that of GL(2) from this exact sequence, it seems that we need to know the relationship between irreducible admissible representations of SO(4) and irreducible admissible representations of $GL_2(k)\times GL_2(k)/\Delta k^*$. Is this something standard or even trivial? On the other hand, in GGP, the authors stated that most local Langlands conjecture for classical groups should be established by the (forthcoming) book of Arthur and Moglin's papers. Arthur's books has already come out $URL$ . I never tried to read Arthur's book. What I would like to know is: whether they (Arthur and Moglin) proved the preservation of local epsilon and L-factors, or they just proved the existence of the local Langlands map.
