Question: What is the maximum value of $|A|$? It is obvious that if $\quad$ $T_m=1+2+\ldots +m=\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$ and $T_m<n$, then $|A|\geq m$. This gives immediately $\max|A|\geq c\cdot \sqrt{n}$. Is it possible to obtain something more accurate? Thanks in advance. 

Here $\omega(x)$ denotes the number of prime factors of $x$. So, I suppose this is still open. I am not sure if there is an update on this problem. 

Erdos usually named a sequence of integers no one of which is divisible by any other as an $M$- sequence (M stands for "multiple-free") or primitive sequence. For example it is easy to see that $\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor+1, \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor+2, \ldots ,n-1, n$ is an $M$- sequence with terms not greater than $n$. Actually we cannot hope from an $M$- sequence to contain more than half of the numbers $\le n$ as Erdos has proved. My question is: Are there other examples of non trivial $M$-sequences (prime numbers, squares of primes, etc) in the literature which we can form explicitly? 

I think the question in the title is clear. Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$. It is a nice exercise to show that every prime number divides infinitely many terms of the sequence $2^n-n$. (For example take $n=(p-1)^{2m} , m\in \mathbb{N}$) I would like to show that there are infinitely many primes for which $2^n\equiv n\pmod{p}$ is actually satisfied for some $0<n<p$ which is equivalent to the question already existing in the title. Any ideas? 

A new (strong) result may affect proving Legendre's conjecture The first thing you can read there is "prime gaps". 

He is a kid. Maybe brilliant but just a kid.I believe that the best you can do is to make sure that he is good at almost all lessons in school and in mathematics you should give him as much as he wants. If he wants to learn more,give him more. This way you will not push him or make him anxious to be the best among all. Feed him only when he is hungry. Consider Gauss.He was the best among all, but he did not have anyone to push him.(as far as i know) Let him push you.If he does,he might be so gifted and he finds interesting mathematics indeed. If he does not, let him live his life. 

In a book i saw a nice answer: ''Elementary Number Theory'' is Number Theory which is based on mathematics you can find in Euclid's ''Elements'' 

My question is: Has it been proved/disproved or studied the following? For every $k\geq 4$ there are $k$ pairwise relatively prime numbers $a_1,a_2,...,a_k$ all greater than $1$ such that $$\text{rad}(a_1+a_2+...+a_k)=\text{rad}(a_1\cdot a_2\cdots a_k)$$ The radical of $n$ is the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. Thanks in advance! 

has finitely many solutions and here is the reason: This equation is equivalent to $p\cdot q\cdot r\cdot s=(x-1)(x+1)$ which shows that $|p\cdot s-q\cdot r|=2$. Now let $q=p+k, r=p+l, s=p+m$. We get $|p(m-k-l)-kl|=2$ which shows that $p\mid kl\pm2$ which means that $p\le kl+2$. This should be a contradiction, because we expect that $k=q-p, l=r-p$ are not "too big" since they represent the gaps between primes who are consecutive and "almost" consecutive. The problem is that we do not even have a proof for $k, l=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt p)$ which probably would be enough to finally solve the problem. So, the fact that $p\le kl+2$ is a nice observation but does not lead anywhere. 

Let $s_2(m)$ be the sum of digits of $m$ in binary form. I would like to ask the following question: 

This Not an answer but an observation about the question. Counting the number of such polynomials which is $O(N^{1/2})$ gives a proof of Sierpinski's prime sequence theorem $URL$ and if you extend your question for polynomials of higher degree you can also extend Sierpinski's theorem for $n>2$ : for any $M>0$ there exists a $t'$ such that $x^n+t',n\geq 2$ contains at least $M$ prime numbers. 

Let $s,x_1,x_2,\cdots, x_s$ be natural numbers not neccesarily distinct. I am interested in solving the equation $$(x_1+x_2+\cdots +x_s)^s=2^s(x_1\cdot x_2\cdots x_s)^2$$ Some Notes: I have found two solutions $(x_1,\cdots ,x_s)$ 1) We can see that equality is satisfied if $x_s= 2^{p-1}(2^p-1)$ is an even perfect number and all the other $x_i$ are the proper divisors of $x_s$. (That is why i started to investigate the equation) Of course we can disregard the restriction that $x_s$ is perfect and show easily that we also get a solution if: $$x_1=1,x_2=2^1,...,x_n=2^{n-1},x_{n+1}=2^n-1,x_{n+2}=2^1(2^n-1),...$$ and $x_s=2^{n-1}(2^n-1)$.(The number $n$ is not necessarily prime ) 2) A trivial one: $$x_1=x_2=\cdots =x_s=\frac{s}{2}$$ . Is it possible to find other solutions or to prove that there are only 2 solutions, those mentioned above? Thanks in advance. 

Skewes has proved (without assuming RH) that $\pi(x)<Li(x)$ is violated below $e^{e^{e^{e^{7.705}}}}$ which is clearly a very large number.I was wondering if somewhere else some greater number than Skewes's can be found. 

Let $m$ be an odd integer greater than $1$. Is it true that there are positive $a, b$ such that $m=a+b$ and $a^2+b^2$ is a prime number? It seems that for every odd $m$ there are many $(a,b)\in \mathbb{N}^2$ which sum to $m$ and their sum of squares give a prime number but I don't see how to prove this. Or, equivalently, is it true that if we list all primes $p=a^2+b^2\equiv 1\pmod{4}$ then $a+b$ covers every odd integer? 

A sequence of natural numbers $(a_n)$ with the property that all pairwise sums of elements are distinct is called a Sidon sequence and it is proved there are at most $s(n)\sim\sqrt n$ elements of such a sequence below $n$. My question is: Is there an (infinite) Sidon sequence with the property: There is an $M>0$ such that for every natural $n\geq M$ there exist $i,j$ with $n=a_i+a_j$. (We include the case where $i=j$ ) I call this kind of sequence "complete" since it covers all positive integers from some point on. I guess that such a sequence does not exist and surely we must have $M>1$ (this easy to prove) I was not able to find a proof or reference. Any help would be appreciated! 

The number of partitions of $n$ into $m$ parts is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into parts, the largest of which is $m$. This can be proved if we read at a graph which represents a partition of $n$ vertically. 

Actually a stronger result (for cube powers) is proved here: Luis H. Gallardo, "On a remark of Makowski about perfect numbers" Elem. Math. 65 (2010) 121 â€“ 126 

(With $2^a,2^b$ being incoguent modulo $p$) 1. Obviously, If $2$ is not a quadratic residue modulo $p$ then we have the solution $a=1, b=\frac{p-1}{2}$ 2. If $2$ is a quadratic residue and the order of $2 \ modp$ is $r=\frac{p-1}{2}$ then the set $ \{2^1,2^2,...,2^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\}$ is a complete quadratic residue system modp. So,In this case, $p\mid2^a+2^b-1$ is equivalent to $p\mid x^2+y^2-1$ with $x^2,y^2$ being incogruent modp, which is always true for every $p\geq11$ . 3. It is not true that if $p \mid2^a+2^b-1$ and $q\mid2^{a'}+2^{b'}-1$ then $p\cdot q\mid 2^c+2^d-1$ . There is the counterexample: $5\mid 2^1+2^2-1$ and $17\mid 2^1+2^4-1$ but $5\cdot 17=85\not \mid2^a+2^b-1$. We can see a few examples of numbers which have the questioned property :$3,7,31,73,89,...$ (In fact,every Mersenne prime does not divide $2^a+2^b-1$) Thanks in advance! 

You are asking if a sum of $i$ numbers equals $2$. The partial sum $S_k=\frac{1}{u_{1,1}}+...+\frac{1}{u_{k,k}}$ does not change as $i$ grows for every $k<i$ so, if you want to reach $2$ there are these possibilities : 1. $i=\infty$ 2. $i<\infty$ We don't know if there are infinitely or finitely many even perfect numbers so we cannot expect to answer your question. It is like you are asking if the sum of the reciprocals of even perfect numbers converges to a rational. If it does, there are finitely many,but we do not have any idea at all about how many exist. But in your comment above, it seems that you understand what I am saying. 

Remember that mathematical induction was invented/discovered because we wanted to answer the following question: how can we prove $1+2+...+n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ is valid for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$? If we ask questions we are getting better.I doubt that a computer would invent/discover group theory in order to investigate the unsolvability of algebraic equations because there would be no question like 

To my best knowledge, we don't know even if the set $S$ has an infinity of elements. In other words we don't know if there exist infinitely many squarefree numbers of the form $2^n-1$. So,i think this is related to an open problem. 

After some search I found some papers which study the sum of digits of all the primes below $N$ but not an answer to my question. Any references (or an answer) would be appreciated! 

Let A,B,C be the vertices.Use the fact that the area is $E=\frac{1}{2}\cdot |det(\vec{AB},\vec{AC})|$ Since $det(\vec{AB},\vec{AC})$ is an integer and the area must be of the form $AB^2\cdot \frac{\sqrt3}{4}$ which is not an integer you can see the contradiction 

My opinion is: Step 1. Repeat the arguments you use in your proofs again and again. If you are still sure that you have some new (valid) things to say about the equation then go to Step 2. Learn how to use LaTeX ,write your paper and submit it to the arXiv. If it is submitted, then go to Step 3. Choose a journal which has previously published papers related to the equation you mention and submit it for publication. (Don't choose the best journal but a serious one) It would be better if you choose a title which won't make the editor think that he will probably waste the time of the referees. A title "Some notes on the equation $x^3 +y^3+z^3=3$" will be safer. Good luck!!! 

It is well known that $\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{6}=1$ and this is the only solution to $\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+\frac{1}{x_3}=1$ with $2\leq x_1<x_2<x_3$. My question is: 

We can see that $x$ must not divide the product of the other elements of $S$ because if it does,$$\mathrm{gcd}\bigg(x,\prod_{y\in S\setminus\{x\}}y\bigg)=x\geq \frac{x}{k}$$ for every $k\geq 1$ .Erdos has proved that every set $S$ with the above property must have $\pi(n)$ elements at most. 

According to Dickson's History of the Theory of Numbers Vol. 1 page 263 at line 5: "A. M. Legendre proved that if $p^Î¼$ is the highest power of the prime $p$ which divides $x!$ $\cdots$ then $$Î¼=\lfloor \frac{m}{p}\rfloor+\lfloor \frac{m}{p^2}\rfloor+\cdots=\frac{m-s}{p-1}$$ where $s=a_0+\cdots+a_n$ is the sum of the digits of $m$ to the base $p$" We can see that rephrasing the above equation yields: $$s=m-(p-1)\cdot \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \lfloor\frac{m}{p^i}\rfloor$$ Which looks like exactly what you wrote . So i guess yes, Legendre first proved this in his famous (according to Dickson) ThÃ©orie des nombres (1808)
