Here's my take on it. I'm not sure what the mystery is - there appear to be two contributing factors. Both the Moon and the Earth simply reflect/partially absorb the light that is incident upon them from the Sun. The overall of albedo is of little consequence, since the reflection of any light will result in an object that appears bright against the night sky. The moon reflects quite uniformly across the whole of the visible range - it actually reflects red a bit better than blue. On the other hand the Earth's albedo is strongly wavelength dependent depending on what is doing the reflecting on the visible hemisphere. See the image below from this site. This injects some perceived colour into reflected earthlight. 

The slowest reaction rate in the pp chain determines how quickly hydrogen can "burn" in the core of a sun-like star. That rate-determining step is actually the fusion of two protons to form deuterium via the diproton and a weak interaction decay. The fusion of lithium, whereby it fuses with a proton and then splits into two Helium nuclei is actually part of the PPII series of reactions that convert helium 3 into helium 4. It does not involve weak interactions and therefore the cross-section at a given temperature is much higher than the first step in the pp chain, regardless of the stronger coulomb repulsion between the reactants. It is therefore initiated at lower temperatures - as you say, Li "burning" occurs in low-mass pre main sequence stars well before hydrogen "burning" commences (but after deuterium burning). 

Humphreys & Larsen (1995) suggest, using star count information, a distance of $20.5 \pm 3.5$ pc above the Galactic plane; consistent with, but more precise than the Bahcall paper referred to by Schleis. Joshi (2007) is more guarded, investigating some systematic uncertainties in the estimation techniques and ends up with distances between 13 and 28 pc above the plane. This paper gives an excellent review of the topic in its first couple of pages. The Sun moves at about 15-20 km/s with respect to a local standard of rest defined by the general motion of stars in our vicinity around the Galaxy. In three-dimensions, this "peculiar velocity" is $U=10.00 \pm 0.36$ km/s (radially inwards), $V=5.25 \pm 0.62$ km/s (in the direction of Galactic rotation) and $W=7.17 \pm 0.38$ km/s (up and out of the plane). (Dehnen & Binney 1998) The Sun executes oscillations around its mean orbit in the Galaxy, periodically crossing the Galactic plane. I borrowed this illustration (not to scale!) from $URL$ to show this oscillatory motion. As the Sun is currently above the plane and moving upwards, and each cycle takes about 70 million years with an amplitude of 100pc (Matese et al. 1995), it will be roughly 30 million years before we cross the plane again. 

There just happens to be a large object at a distance that is highly reflective. I'll use 1000 light years away as an example, which would allow us to see 2000 years into the Earth's past. 

Here is my attempt to reconcile your calculations. If the AB g-band apparent magnitude is 22.5, then the flux density in the g-band is given by $$f_{\nu} = 10^{(-48.6-22.5)/2.5} = 3.63 \times 10^{-29}\ {\rm erg\ cm}^{-2} {\rm s}^{-1} {\rm Hz}^{-1}$$ If the distance is 1991 Mpc, then the absolute g magnitude is $$ M_g = m_g - 5\log d + 5 = -19.0$$ The absolute AB magnitude of the Sun in the g-band (from your source) is 5.12. The latter tells us that the ratio of the "g-band luminosites" of the galaxy and the Sun are given by $$\frac{L_g}{L_{\odot,g}} = 10^{0.4(M_{{\odot},g} - M_g)} = 4.45\times 10^{9}$$ One cannot say more than this, in particular one cannot calculate the luminosity of the galaxy, without knowing more about its spectrum. Also note that the equation above cannot be used to find the ratio of flux in one band to bolometric flux, as I think you are trying to do. To see this, consider that the absolute V-band magnitude and bolometric magnitude of the Sun are almost the same. This does not mean that all the flux from the Sun emerges in the V band! Your second method requires a figure for $\Delta \nu$, but you haven't said what you have used. The g-filter has a width of around $\Delta \lambda =100$ nm. Using $\lambda \nu = c$ we can say $$ \Delta \nu = |c\Delta \lambda/\lambda^2| = 1.28\times 10^{14}\ {\rm Hz}$$ $$ L_g = 4\pi d^2 f_{\nu} \Delta \nu = 2.2 \times 10^{42} {\rm erg/s}$$ The two figures would agree precisely if the "g-band luminosity" of the Sun were $4.9 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s, or in other words if 13% of the solar luminosity emerged in the g-band as defined above. This does not sound unreasonable, but requires a detailed integration of the solar spectrum over the actual g-band filter profile. Additional: Just to check the numbers above, we can estimate the flux density of the Sun (in wavelength units, above the atmosphere) to be about 1.7 W m$^{-2}$ nm$^{-1}$ at 467 nm (just search on 'solar spectrum' for many examples) at a distance of $1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m. Putting these numbers together, I calculate a "g-band luminosity" for the Sun of $$ L_{\odot,g}=4\pi d^2 f_{\lambda}\Delta \lambda = 4.8\times 10^{25} \rm W$$ which is indeed 13% of the solar bolometric luminosity. 

Copper is not thought to be primarily made in a supernova. It is thought to be mainly produced by the s-process of slow neutron capture onto iron-peak nuclei that already exist inside a star. These reactions are endothermic. The source of the neutrons is still somewhat debated, it could either be from the decay of $^{13}$C in relatively low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars or is more likely from the decay of $^{22}$Ne in more massive evolved stars (e.g. Pignatari et al. 2010). Below you can see a typical route for producing copper from $^{56}$Fe. The axes of the plot are neutron number on the x-axis and proton (atomic) number on the y-axis. Three neutron captures are followed by a beta decay, a neutron capture, a beta decay, then 3 more neutron captures followed by another beta decay to form $^{63}$Cu. The net process is $$ ^{56}{\rm Fe} + 7n \rightarrow \ ^{63}{\rm Cu} + 3e + 3\bar{\nu}_e$$ The copper is then distributed into the interstellar medium by a later supernova explosion in the same star. If there are no "seed" iron-peak nuclei (e.g. in the first/second generation of stars), then copper can be inefficiently produced by explosive r-process neutron capture during supernovae explosions. However, this would not contribute very much to the copper we see on the Earth. 

I don't think that the authors are claiming that this is exactly what all the planets are made of, but simply illustrating that at present there do not seem to be any large deviations from such a composition (for example, planets that are made solely of iron). There are relatively few planets on this diagram, because it is difficult to obtain the masses of small transiting planets (it requires detection of the doppler shift caused by the pull of the planet on its host star). Of course different models yield somewhat different results. For instance, Wagner et al. (2012) used the same data for Kepler-10b and CoRoT-7b and their own detailed models to argue that these planets have an iron core that makes up about 60% of the planet - i.e. a lot more than makes up the Earth. At the moment the data for the lowest mass planets currently indicate that there could only be a limited amount of diversity. But the information that we are working with, the sample size, and the fact that only masses and radii are determined, is too sparse to be sure. From a theoretical point of view there are many ideas. The basic concept about the formation of the terrestrial-type planets is that they form (relatively) close in to the parent star and have compositions that are reflective of what elements and minerals can condense out of the protoplanetary disk at high temperatures. This in turn depends on the balance of elements that are present in the protoplanetary disk, where in the disk the planet forms, the detailed structure of the protoplanetary disk, how it cools and how planets migrate in the disk. Unsurprisingly, by varying some of these conditions it is possible to create planets with a wide variety of compositions, which as I said above, appears to be mildly contradicted by the available evidence. At the most basic level we understand why the Earth and other terrestrial planets are comparatively lacking in "volatile" elements like hydrogen and helium (and to some extent C, N, O and noble gases), because they (or minerals containing them) could not condense at the high temperatures close to the proto-Sun. Examples of these theoretical approaches can be found in Moriarty et al. (2014) (of which you are familiar), but also see Carter-Bond et al. (2012) for examples of how chemical diversity might arise. It seems that the Mg/Si and the C/O ratios have the biggest influence on the final compositions of the formed planets. A low C/O ratio favours the formation of silicates and fewer carbon-carrying compounds; but if there is more carbon than oxygen then it becomes more favourable to form carbon and silicon-carbide (I guess this is what you mean by "carbon planets"), but this also depends on the temperature in the region where the planet forms. For reference, the solar C/O ratio is 0.54 and the relative abundance of carbon in the Earth is much lower (than in the Sun) but the C/O ratio measured in other stars can be higher.
