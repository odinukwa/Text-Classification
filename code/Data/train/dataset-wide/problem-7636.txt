It is a slick, and seemingly ad-hoc, technique often used to prove that a Diophantine equation has no solutions. The equation $f(x_1,\ldots, x_k)=0$, with variables $x_i\in\mathbb{Z}$ and some elementary function $f$, is taken modulo some ingeniously chosen $n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$. Then by evaluating $f$ on the $k^n$ possible $k$-tuples $(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ of residues modulo $n$, it is shown that $0$ is achieved in no case. Thus no solution exists in $\mathbb{Z}$ either. A traditional classroom example is $x^2+y^2-3z^2=0$. Assume $\gcd(x,y)=1$ without loss of generality, and use modulo $3$. The trouble is in coming up with the brilliant $n$. An example of a good heuristic principle is choosing modulo $20$ if there are powers of $4$ as, out of to $20$ possible residues, the only quartic residues are $0,1,5,16$. Are there similar mods for other powers? In general, has there been any work done on an objective way of finding $n$? Perhaps good heuristics, if nothing else? Restrict $f$ to some non-trivial case, say certain polynomials of given degree, if needed. Paper references would be nice. 

Given the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$, endowed with the standard inner (dot) product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle:\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$, the problem of almost-orthogonal sets asks, for each $\epsilon> 0$, for the construction (or at the very least, bounds on the cardinality) of a maximal subset $S$ of $U_n$, the set of unit vectors of $\mathbb{R}^n$, such that $\forall x,y\in S: x\ne y\implies |\langle x,y\rangle|\le\epsilon$. For known results, see Matt Cheung's Major Qualifying Project monograph at this link. Question: What are known results, if we restrict ourselves to some subset of $U_n$? Specifically, I am interested in the subset $\lbrace\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rbrace^n$ consisting of the vertices of the scaled-down unit cube inscribed inside the unit ball centered at $0$. 

Theorem. The Galois group of a quintic polynomial $f\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is $A_5$ if and only if its discriminant is a rational square and its Weber sextic resolvent has no rational root. Question. What are known infinite families of of quintic polynomials in $\mathbb{Q}[x]$, each with Galois group $A_5$? I am aware of two explicit such families as follows. Example 1. $f(x)=x^5+(5t^2-1)(5x+4)$ for $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ such that $t\equiv\pm 1\pmod{21}$. This is Exercise 3.7.2 in the book Generic Polynomials by Jensen, Ledet and Yui. Example 2. $f(x)=x^5+(t^2-5^5)(x-4)$ for non-zero $t\in\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\forall u\in\mathbb{Q}: t\ne g(u)$ where $g(u)=\frac{(u^3-18u^2+8u-16)(u^3+2u^2+18u+4)}{2u^2(u^2+4)}$. This is from the paper Reducibility and the Galois group of a parametric family of quintic polynomials by Lavallee, Spearman and Williams. Note. Both are all trinomials, presumably because it is easier to construct polynomials with square discriminant when some coefficients vanish. It would be nice to see otherwise. 

I don't know much about the theory of Hilbert spaces but a research project has me working with them a little bit. In particular requiring an operator to be Hilbert-Schmidt is a recurring condition. According to wikipedia one nice thing about H-S operators is that on a separable Hilbert space $H$ the set of H-S endomorphisms forms a Hilbert space that is naturally isomorphic to $H\otimes H^*$. So I'm wondering what else is nice about H-S operators. And what else works with H-S operators that wouldn't work for another class of operators. Fredholm operators also come up a lot. It $T$ is H-S and $S$ is Fredholm what can be said about the composition? 

Say $G$ is a reductive group over a field $k$. I usually take $k = \mathbb{C}$ so assume what you want about the field except maybe that its finite. If $X$ is a scheme over $k$ then a principal $G$ bundles over $X$ is a scheme $P$ together with a right action of $G$ and an equivariant projection to $X$ (with trivial action on $X$) such that $P$ is locally trivial in the etale topology. For some groups like $GL_n,SL_n$ and solvable groups principal bundles are locally trivial even in the Zariski topology. These are called special groups and Grothendieck classified them. I'm curious if $G',G''$ are special groups and $G$ fits into an exact sequence $1 \to G' \to G \to G'' \to 1$, then is it the case that $G$ is special? There is a paper by Serre that claims this at least for $G',G''$ commutative and its supposed to be a consequence of the exact sequence $\check H^1(X,G') \to \check H^1(X,G) \to \check H^1(X,G'')$. This is \check Cech cohomology in the etale topology. You have $\check H^1(X,G') \cong \check H^1(X_{zar}, G')$ and $\check H^1(X,G'') \cong \check H^1(X_{zar}, G'')$ and a map $\check H^1(X_{zar},G') \to \check H^1(X, G)$ but it seems you are still short of being able to use e.g. the 5-lemma. This can probably be deduced from Grothendieck's thm but I'm wondering if there is a direct argument. 

Nearly two months after I asked the above question, I have come across a paper where Noga Alon has given an explicit result in Problems and results in Extremal Combinatorics, Part I in section 9, On ranks of perturbations of identity matrices. He says Lemma 9.1. Let $A = (a_{ij})$ be an $n \times n$ real, symmetric matrix with $a_{ii} = 1$ for all $i$ and $|a_{ij}|\le\epsilon$ for all $i\ne j$. If the rank of $A$ is $d$, then $d\ge \frac{n}{1+(n-1)\epsilon^2}$. In particular, if $\epsilon\le \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ then $d\ge\frac{n}{2}$. His proof is rather pretty. I apply the lemma to the question at hand as follows. Application. Suppose $S$ is an $m\times n$ matrix with row vectors $(s_1,\ldots, s_m)$, an $m$-element subset of $\lbrace\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}},-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\rbrace^n$ such that $\forall s_i,s_j\in S: i\ne j\implies |\langle s_i,s_j\rangle|\le\epsilon$. Let $A=(a_{ij})$ be its Gram matrix, which is symmetric $m\times m$ with $a_{ii} = \langle s_i,s_i\rangle = 1$ for all $i$ and $|a_{ij}|=|\langle s_i, s_j \rangle|\le\epsilon$ for all $i\ne j$, and rank $d$. Note that the rank of $S$ also $d$. By the lemma, since $n\ge d$, we get $\boxed{n\ge \frac{m}{1+(m-1)\epsilon^2}}$. Assuming $\epsilon\le \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$, some manipulation also yields $\boxed{m\le \frac{n(1-\epsilon^2)}{1-n\epsilon^2}}$. Bill Johnson's reference to the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma led me to its Wikipedia page, which had the paper as a reference. 

Could you state or direct me to results regarding the Diophantine equation $a^2+b^2=c^2+d^2$ over integers? Specifically, I am looking for a complete parametrization. In the case that a complete parametrization does not exist, I would be interested in seeing complete parametrizations for special cases. For example, in the case that any one of the variables is zero, we are led to Pythagorean triples. Taking a variable to be some non-zero constant would be interesting. I'm looking for known results as I am not as familiar with the literature as many MO-ers out there. 

Theorem: In this paper of Frei and Levesque, they correct the proof of a result of Halter-Koch and Stender: Define the real pure algebraic number field $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{Q}(\omega_n)$ for $\omega_n=\sqrt[n]{D^n\pm d}>0$ (the $\pm$ sign is fixed), where $d,D,n\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $d|D^n$ and $D^n\pm d$ is not a $k^{\text{th}}$-power positive integer for $k|n$. Let $\epsilon_{n,k}=\frac{(\omega_n-D)^k}{\omega_n^k-D^k}$. Then the set $\{\epsilon_{n,k}: k\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}, k|n\}$ is an independent system of units in $\mathbb{K}$. Background: I am looking specifically at computing units of algebraic number fields of the form $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{t})$ for odd primes $p$ (any infinite family in $t\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, with $p$ fixed). Unfortunately, the above result gives only one unit $\frac{(\omega_p-D)^p}{\omega_p^p-D^p}$. Question: Are there results on obtaining at least one other independent (non-torsion) unit? Note: For irreducible $x^p-t$ there is one real root $\sqrt[p]{t}$ and $p-1$ non-real complex roots $\zeta_p^i \sqrt[p]{t}$ for $i=1,\ldots,p-1$ and $\zeta_p=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{p}}$. Then by Dirichlet's Unit Theorem, the unit rank of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[p]{t})$ is $1+\frac{p-1}{2}-1=\frac{p-1}{2}$. Thus I am especially interested in $p=5$ where there can be at most two independent units. 

I've learned when you have a integral smooth scheme line bundles are the same as Cartier divisors are the same as Weil divisors. My question is to what extent does this continue to hold (if at all) when you are talking about ind objects. Since things become more subtle in positive characteristic lets say we are working over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Background I think the situation can be quite different because smoothness, or algebraic smoothness is more complicated. In the non ind scheme case you can define smoothness of a point $p \in X$ as $S^q(m/m^2) \to m^q/m^{q+1}$ being an isomorphism for all $q\ge 0$, where $m$ is the maximal ideal of the local ring at $p$. In the ind case you have varieties $(X_n)_{n \ge 0}$ and $p \in X_n$ for all sufficiently large $n$ so you have $S_n^q(m_n/m_n^2) \to m^q_n/m^{q+1}_n$ for all sufficiently large $n$. Algebraic smoothness at $p$ means that the map $\varprojlim S_n^q(m_n/m_n^2) \to \varprojlim m^q_n/m^{q+1}_n$ is an isomorphism for all $q\ge 0$ Thoughts It is true that if $X$ is the union of $X_n$ and each $X_n$ is smooth then $X$ is algebraically smooth. However algebraic smoothness is not inductive in the sense that there are examples of $p \in X$ being algebraically smooth even when $p \in X_n$ is a singular point for all $X_n$ containing $p$. However line bundles are inductive in the sense that a line bundles on $X$ determines line bundles on each $X_n$ compatible under pull back and vice versa. This suggests to me that you could have a collection of compatible Weil divisors in each $X_n$ which are not the zero section of any section of any line bundle. But I don't have an example. 

This question is largely out of curiosity but also motivated by an attempt to understand vector bundles on elliptic curves better. I believe it is a theorem of Grauert that any holomorphic vector bundle on a non compact Riemann surface is trivial. In fact I think it holds with vector bundle replaced with principal $G$ bundle with $G$ any complex connected group. In particular line bundles on affine algebraic curves should be holomorphically trivial. The ideal $m = (x,y) \subset \mathbb{C}[x,y]/(y^2 - x^3 + x)$ determines a rank 1 locally free sheaf and hence a line bundle $L$. Any algebraic section of $L$ must vanish somewhere but there should be non vanishing holomorphic sections. Can one write down such a section? Presumably it may be hard to do so in terms of the algebraic coordinates $x,y$ but the curve is biholomophic to $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}^2 - \mathbb{Z}^2$ with the isomorphism given by the Weierstrass function and it's derivative and I would be happy with a section defined on $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}^2 - \mathbb{Z}^2$. 

Definition. An $m\times n$ matrix is said to be a partial Hadamard matrix (let's say PHM) if its entries are chosen from $\lbrace -1, 1 \rbrace$ such that the dot product of each pair of row vectors is $0$. Details. This of course relates to the famous Hadamard conjecture which looks at $m=n$, but I am interested in the weaker $m<n$ case. Specifically, I am wondering about how many distinct $m\times n$ PHM exist given some, say $2$, of the row vectors, up to row permutation - as well as their construction. Questions. What are some good resources on results known about PHM? Are there iconic papers in the field? 

An irreducible quintic $f(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$, is solvable by radicals if and only if its sextic resolvent $\theta_f (y)=(y^3+py^2+qy+r)^2-2^{10}\Delta(f)y$ has a rational root ($\Delta$ is the discriminant of $f$, and $a,b,c$ are some defined rationals, see the Cox reference). In many cases, this associated sextic is not pretty. More troublesome is that in my work I am often coming across quintics with the coefficients in terms of some parameter, where in general we cannot use the Rational Root Test on the sextic. Any advice on proving the (non)existence of a rational root of the sextic resolvent of an irreducible rational quintic (especially sufficient criteria for non-existence)? Examples or references to special cases are fine. Is the usual technique just ad-hoc tricks? References: 

A website ( $URL$ ) says that the $abc$ conjecture implies that there are only finitely many solutions to the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ with $\gcd(x,y,z)=1$ and $n\ge 4$. This one I have proven. Lang's Algebra (p. 196) says that the $abc$ conjecture implies that for all $n$ sufficiently large, there are no solutions to the equation $x^n+y^n=z^n$ with $x,y,z\ne 0$. This one I have not proven (is it true?). What are the strongest known assertions about Fermat's Last Theorem that follows from the $abc$ conjecture, and how are they proven? I searched the web but people tend to just say vague things like "implies asymptotic version of FLT" and such. 

If $X \xrightarrow{f} Y$ is a morphism of schemes then the scheme theoretic image of $f$ is the smallest closed subscheme $Z \subset Y$ through which $f$ factors through. Is this notion defined for algebraic stacks (at least under reasonable assumptions)? If so, can someone provide a reference? 

This map is written thinking of J(C) as C^g/L where g = genus(C) and L is the lattice of periods. C^g/L can be made algebraic by embedding into a projective space via theta functions. These are section of a line bundle associated to some multiple of a theta divisor $\Theta$ on J(C) $URL$ Then it suffices to show that the restriction to $\Theta$ to C is an ample divisor; but J(C) is a smooth manifold and dim $\Theta$ + dim C = dim J(C) and so $C \cap \Theta$ is a finite number of points, hence ample. 

Say I have an ind scheme $X = \cup_i X_i$ over a field $k$. I have its tangent bundle $\hom_k(k[\epsilon], X)$ which I can think of as ind scheme via $\cup_i \hom_k(k[\epsilon],X_i)$. The problem is even if $X$ is smooth it might be the case that most of the $X_i$ are not smooth. I believe this happens at least for polynomial loop groups $G[z^\pm]$. In this case the sheaf of differentials is not locally free. This seems to be an obstruction to constructing the canonical sheaf inductively. Additionally if each $X_i$ is infinite dimensional, which happens for the formal loop group, then it seems like top exterior power doesn't make much sense. And finally if you looked at say $\mathbb{P}^\infty := \cup_n \mathbb{P}^n$ then it also seems unclear what a canonical sheaf should be. If it were a line bundle it could be described as a line bundle $L_n$ on each $\mathbb{P}^n$ which are compatible under pull backs. But then each $L_n$ would have the same degree $d$. But the canonical line bundles $O(-n-1)$ have a different degree on each $\mathbb{P}^n$! So is there any sense in asking for something like a canonical sheaf or dualizing sheaf for smooth ind schemes? UPDATE: Brian Conrad shared the following with me: If $f:X \to Y$ is a map between finite type schemes over a field (or one can be much more general...) then for a relative dualizing complex $\omega_Y$ on $Y$ we have that $f^!(\omega_Y)$ is a relative dualizing complex on $X$ (for suitable functor $f^!$ at derived category level). In other words, one does have "compatibility" for relative dualizing complexes, but with respect to the appropriate "derived pullback" operation $f^!$. (One has to think about duality and "canonical sheaf" in a much broader sense than Serre duality over a field in order to define "relative dualizing object" in a derived category.) The upshot is that one has to work in derived categories (and so develop a suitable formalism of direct/inverse limits in derived categories) to make a good theory of duality on ind-schemes.
